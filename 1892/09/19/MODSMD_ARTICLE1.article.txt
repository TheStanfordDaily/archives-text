# Last Tuesday's Lecture.
## 
### 
Wo are all glad to see that the reg
ular Tuesday evening lectures, which
have been such a pleasing feature
since the University first opened, are |
to be continued during the present j
year. The initial address was given 1
in the Chapel this week by Prof. Ilud-i
son, who spoke on " Herbert Spencer,"'
basing his address upon personal asso
ciation with the great man.
lie dwelt largely upon the youth 1
and early manhood of Spencer, that
part of life so interesting to the stu
dent, showing the influences which ,
worked in the development of the |
wonderful man he grew to be.
Though a backward child, Spencer
was kept in touch with the most lib
eral views of all the questions of the
times by means of the brilliant con
versation of his father and the cele- i
brated people who visited the house. 1
He was apt in mathematics and 1
constructive mechanics. Greatly to i
his advantage, he refused to go to col
lege, but instead spent some time at
civil engineering. It was soon aftea
this he was converted to the truths of
evolution, and then he began to write.
Spencer's famous '* Social Status " is
startling in its radical tone and ten
dency ; indeed all his works show
marked originality in this line. lie
wrote much and on many subject!* for

complete, Spencer now is an old
man, and his constant ill health, in
spite of his wonderful activity in the
matter, leaves it to be feared that this
great world message never will be
finished.
Prof. Hudson closed by saying that
the lesson we can get from this great
life is that, there is something in this
world to do for each one of us that
only he can do, and to this he must
consecrate himself and in it be always
firm of conscience and strong of will.
