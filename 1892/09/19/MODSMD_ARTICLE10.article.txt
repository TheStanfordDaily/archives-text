# University Music.

### 
The prospects of the orchestra have
considerably brightened since the ar
rival of Lewis Chase, who is a young
violinist of well merited repute, and
who, with Carl Thomas, would make
a lead equal to that of many of the
high-priced orchestras of this coast.
It is only repeating what is well
known, to say that the College has
throughout the entire year strongly
felt the necessity of a good musical
organization and, this year there will
be even more need for one than before.
A good orchestra cannot be built up
and trained in a day or a week, and,
as there will soon be iieed for it, the
matter of its immediate organization
is of considerable consequence. There
is but one thing which hinders the
members from practicing as a body,
and that is the lack of a double bass.
There is not one in College nor is there
any probability that there will be un
less the University purchases it. ()ther
colleges purchase the entire sets, and
it would be well if we followed their
example to this extent at least. It
would always remain the property of
the University and with it the orches
tra would be complete and the proba
bility o' College music for the future
assured. It is by no means an expen
sive instrument and it is to be hoped
that one will be obtained immediately.
