Quite a pleasant social event took
place at Miss Dickenson's house in
the Row last Saturday evening.
About fifty students and Professors
assembled at eight o'clock and spent
the evening in dancing, music and
conversation. About nine o'clock re
freshments were served, after which
the varions diversions were resumed
until a late hour. The music was
furnished by Mr. Capron and Mr.
Chase of Encina Hall. Favors of the
evening were blue and gold butter
flies.
