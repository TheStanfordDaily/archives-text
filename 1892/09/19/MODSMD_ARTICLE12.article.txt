# TOPOGRAPHY CALIFORNIA.

### 
The geological causes which gave to
California its singular surface configu
ration have been for nearly fifty yeurs a
subject of the deepest interest forscieu.
tists; for in no other part of the country
have subteraneous and superterrene dy
namical forces wrought with such stu
pendous energy and startling result.
Nor has the first-named of these mighty
energies, which in the ages past lifted
up great regions and Hooded vast areas
with lava, yet ceased its operation;
geysers in the canyons, solfataras in
slumbering craters, and an occasional
temblor give evidence that tlie giant
under the earth is tossing feebly on his
death-bed. To stand tiius and see him
die, even though in his harmless strug
gles he terrify the strongest of us, is a
thing worth doing; to observe the
early works of his fury, softened as they
are l>y his milder coadjutors, Flood and
Glacier, —both born long after him,
and dead these many ceuturies, —and
to notice over all these mighty wrecks,
distortions and lacerations the kindliest
touch of present nature in her sweetest
mood, is to add reverence to under
standing and give n finer form to life.
The average " tourist," slipping
through the fingers of the Almighty,
skurries gregariously through the State,
from Los Angeles to Mount Shasta;
sees strange and beautiful semi-tropic
products cultivated in broad acres;
visits Yosemite, and stands head
covered at the foot of El Capitan; stops
sometimes to see the most gorgeous
ocean sunsets that the world affords ;
passes all his spare time in luxurious
hotels ; lounges comfortably in a sleep
ing-car while passing under the shadow
of the great dead volcano of the north;
and after all this he has seen—Califor
nia? No. He lias seen a strange and
beautiful picture, but not a thousandth
part of the grandeur of it all. For
knowledge must precede understand
ing, and intelligent perception is the
basis of the best pleasure that travel
can afl'ord. I n the topography of Cal
ifornia reside its greater marvels. Kail
roads follow the lines of least resistence,
Traffic is a child of commerce ; the
spectacular is merely an incident of the
utilitarian. All this means to say, —
first, that fora proper appreciation of
the topography of California one ought
not only to learn what is new, but for
get what is old; second, that the rail
roads, following the easiest paths, are
but an invitation to see and enjoy the
nobler things that lie be3 T ond the right
of way.—Lippincott'is Magazine.
