## What Our Men Did This Summer. 
### 
u number of our nth let"
have not been idle during the sumnu
vacation. At the meet in Kiversi<
of the Southern California Amatei
Athletic Association two Stanfo*
men won laurels. Whtetuore w«
the 1 lit yard hurdle in 17}, th
slightly lowering his record here. I'
alto gi I the running broad Jim
clearing 20 feet 8 inches.
Maynard, who got the quarter
ur last field, eclipsed Ins forn
rd a; 1 covered himself with glo
He made the quarter in o4 secon
coming in an easy winner. At
.-tart he was set back three yards
stepping off the mark, and t
coupled with the fact that the tr:
at liiver.-ide was three yards long
far towards indicating him as a rec
breaker the ensuing year. At «
imc >'t I;is race at Riverside Mayn
was not in training. Though
rat he i li ht athletic build, he is, i
his nerve-staying powers, determ
n and head work, a man with a
ture before him.
In the latter part of August Wb

more, who had been training under
the direction of the Pastime Club of
St. Louis, won the 130 yards hurdle,
race in I(s} at the Western Cham
pion-hip (iatues in Detroit. This lat
ter record is something he can feel
justly proud of. Whitteniore goes to
Cornell this Fall and we ought to hear]
something of him in athletic lines;
there.
Han croft, at the Denver Athletic
Club easily defeated a rival after j
giving him fifty yards handicap in
the mile walk. Later on he gavel
Smith of the same Club one hundred j
yards handicap and was defeated by :
only three yards.
Edwards ha.- been in several bi
cycle races this Summer and is fast
demonstrating himself as the coming
champion of the coast.
Last Friday, at Stockton, Alexan
der came in second in the half-mile j
bicycle race, J. C. Burks of Los An
geles being first. Burke's time was!
1:12; Alexander's was 1:12 2-5. The
coast record before this was 1:15. If
Alexander had a racing wheel, as his
opponent did, he would doubtless
have won first place. As it is, lie
has broken the former coast record.
