in local politics.
It is the general opinion that Prof.
Closes will be re-elected President of
the University at the next meeting of
the Regents, which will take place in
Janna ry.
Kennedy has very weak ankles and .
will probably be unable to play on
that account. Neither Dubbcrs nor j
Man will be in college ; so, that is the
condition of last year's team.
Ground was broken last Wednesday ;
for the new Electrical Engineering
building which is to be erected at an
expenditure of 850,000. Quitifc a large
sum in addition to this amount has
been set aside in order to lit it up with
the proper apparatus.
They have vuite a promising young
man for quarter-back in Wilber, a
'90 man from < )akland. '90 has many
good sinewy looking men but they are
untried material so far. Wilson from
the Gymnasium, Powell from the High ■
School, and Edwards from Oakland, j
are spoken of as promising young ath- j
letes of the Freshmen class.

Watchorst, although he will attend |
one of the San Francisco colleges, will

They will have a training table not
withstanding their scoffs at ours last
year.
i The U. (J. men have taken hold of
foot-ball now in earnest. During the
i past week a squad of from twenty-five
to thirty men have turned out on the
campus daily for an hour's practice
.under the instruction of the : r new
coach, Mr. Fish, of Wesleyan. The
field is still very hard but pipes have
j been laid with bli"d hydrants at con
venient distances so that the campus
1 can be flooded. The students have
done this at their own expense as the
Regents absolutely refuse to expend
| any more money on the Athletic Field
after the long needed help which they
gave last year. There has been some
talk of building a reservoir : nd a dam
in Strawberry Canyon to catch and
hold the rainfall for purposes of irriga
tion on the campus.
