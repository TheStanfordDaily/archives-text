first appearance to-day. The Univer
sity will not be startled at seeing it.
No, there was too much discussion on
the matter before it assumed definite
shape. We took the matter in hand
last year when we asked the Associated
Students to appoint a committee to
take the necessary steps towards its
establishment. At that time there
was a cry started which has increased
up to the time of going to press. The
substance of the cry was, We are a
college not old enough nor large
enough to support a daily. We could
not disregard the cry We canvassed
the matter carefully, looked up data
concerning college dailies and became
convinced that there is little to be
feared. We find that those professors
and students who have had most to
do with college papers are most san
guine of success.
As yet there is no demand fora
■daily but there is a field for it. A\ hen
all the students lived in Encina and
Ruble Halls the bulletin boards served
the purpose of publishing important
notices. This year less than one-third
«of the students live on the grounds.
In each succeeding month the students
will scatter farther out from the center
of the University. The daily will be
to students thus scattered what the
business man can afford to be without
.newspaper is to the business man. No
the newspaper and, if the Daily Palo
Alto is carried out on the plan upon
which it is projected, it will become
quite as necessary to students and
professors. It is to be the medium
through which all items of interest may
be published to the members of the
University. It will contain items of
interest from other colleges of the
country and thus span the distance
between this and other universities.
And though it is mentioned last yet it
is not to be considered a small matter
that the Daily Palo Alto will ad
vertise the University in fields not
otherwise reached. True it is that the
daily will not make a great university,
luit just as true is it that the daily is
one of the signs of a great university.
This is not a paper by a few indi

viduals, acting in a private capacity.
It is the organ ot the stm'-nts of the
Stanford University. The success
which it meets is dependent as much
upon the support of the students pud
professors as upon the editors and
managers. In this our first issue we,
the editors and managers pledge to
the members of the University to use
our best endeavors to make our paper
such that it will be a credit to our
alma mater. To the professors and
students we have but one request and
that is that you show an appreciation
of our work by your hearty support.
Do not misunderstand our request.
Criticism given in the right spirit we
shall consider the best aid that can be
given us. I)o not consider an item too
small to mention, for in the multitude
of duties which overwhelm us, many
an important detail escapes us. Your
financial support we do not mention,
for the need of that is too apparent.
A word to the professors. Much of
our readiug matter must come from
you. You have daily a score of de
tails concerning your work which you
wish to have known, and which does
not seem worth while placing on the
bulletin boards. If you can make a
mental note of them as they occur,
you can call the attention of one of the
assistauts to them and the matter can
be attended to at once.
