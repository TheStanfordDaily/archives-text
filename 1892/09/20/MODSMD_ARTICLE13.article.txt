To-day's Examiner contains two
columns of notoriety for the Univer
sity of California, part of which con
sists in bad wood cuts representing
several young ladies in mortar boards.
The reading matter which accom
panies the wood cuts describes in
thrilling language the contest which
the co-eds are making to have the
mortar board become the college hat.
From the head lines one would expect
a column and a half of readable college
news but after finishing the article
you will find that you have abso
lutely nothing for the pains you spent
ifr i'eftdwg. it-is followed by a hnlf
column of matter concerning a prohi
bition against smoking in one of the
halls. This, like the preceeding, has
all the gusto of an important news
column. It interviews Prof. Bradley
on the subject, notes important obser
vations of various students on the
weighty subject in hand and when
you have finished it, you know only
that the faculty intend to enforce the
rule against smoking in the halls.
We do not feel like laughing at the
silly spectacle which our rival college
makes when held up to the gaze of
the public bv the Monarch of Dailies.
Our smile is repressed by the
thought of our own position last spring
when the Monarch of the Dailies could
not find reading matter enough to fill
its sixteen pages and sent one of its
men to invent a tempest out of a very
gentle breeze which chanced to be
blowing around the University at
that time, it will be remembered, the
Monthly I'alo Alto was giving offense
to a limited few but under the facile
pen of the bright, young reporter
whom the Monarch requested to in
vent news, the otherwise small paper
assumed such gigantic proportions and
gave offense to such a large number
that it required the combined efforts
of the Evangelical Churches of San
Francisco to force it into the oblivion
which was denied it by Monarch.
Since we have gone into the daily
business we can readily see how there
is very often need for extra matter to
iill up a column and give a neat ap

pearance to the printed page but we
hope that if it ever falls to our lot to
sacrifice any tiling for the sake of me
chanical effects that we may not pre
sent such an appearance to our readers
as does the Examiner.
