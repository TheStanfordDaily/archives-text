There is a great deal of complaint
among those who get their mail at En
cina on account of the way the paper
mail is disposed of. Until lately all the
mail was handled as it is in a small
postoftice. But now the papers are I
placed in a rack in the lobby, where '
every man must rustle for his own
mail or have it lost or stolen. We
doubt very much if those in charge of
mail matter at Encina have a right to
dispose of the papers in this way.
