# Facility vs. Freshman.
## 
### 
That youth and age do not go
hand in hand especially around the
bases, was fully demonstrated (Satur
day afternoon. The game casts .no
discredit upon the Faculty team, for
the Sophomores have admittedly the
best class team in College. The feat
ures of the game were the home run
of Calhoun, the steady playing of
Swain at first; the great number of
holes in the same gentleman's bat,
and the marked division of the specta
tors. The score is as below:
