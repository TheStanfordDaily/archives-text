# Return of Our Founders.
## 
### 
There are many who are anxiously
awaiting the return from Europe of
Senator and Mrs. Stanford. A letter
of a week ago to President Jordan
states that it is their intention to j
leave for America on October oth.
The cholera may make some change j
of their plans, lÂ»ut it is fair to hope
that we may see them in sometime less
than four weeks. Just before leaving
for Europe it was hinted that it was
Senator Stanford's intention to retire
from his position in the Senate. In !
case he does so he will probably retire I
from active life and we can then hope
to see him take charge oi the affairs
now in the hands of Mr. Lathrop, his |
attorney.
