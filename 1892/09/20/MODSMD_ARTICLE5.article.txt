# Football Communication
## 
### 
A communication of the U. C. foot- i
ball team is in the hands of Captain
Clemans. The Berkeley boys want j
the game to come off on Thanksgiving ;
Day instead of Washington's Birth-1
day, as proposed by Clematis. It
seems that their coach, Mr, Fish, i
has positively refused to stay with i
them longer than Nov. 15th. They
hope to have a permanent coach next
year and promise to play us then at ,
any time we may desire, but they ;
ask us, in " view of the spirit of comity !
which should exist between colleges,"
to make an exception in their favor
this year and they will try to return 1
it at some future time. The XT. C, 1
team will begin active practice next
Monday. Neither Henry, Kennedy !
nor Foulks will play this year.
