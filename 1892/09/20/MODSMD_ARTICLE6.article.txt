not being counter-ordered until

unnoticed and quite a number of the
I friends ol'the Society collected about
the doors of the Chapel only to be re
fused admittance. The few who were
so fortunate as to pass the door-keeper
spent a delightful evening and ex
pressed themselves as highly pleased
with the exercises. In the business
l meeting which followed the following
officers tor the year were* elected
I .Miss Haven, President; Mr. Wm.
