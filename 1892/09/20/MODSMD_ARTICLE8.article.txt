# Football Trophy.
## 
### 
Last week Dr. Jordan received u
letter from the University Club of
San Francisco containing a very gen
erous offer as an encouragement to
the great college game. The Club
offers a silver cup as a trophy for the
Stanlbrd-U. C. football games, and
asks that a committee from among
our students meet with a similar com
mittee from the U. C. and one from
the Club to arrange the details which
will come up in connection with the
game. Toe only thing which is in
sisted upon is that the games be
played in San Francisco.
This offer will warm up our enthu
siasts, for it shows that a genuine in
terest is being felt in the rival col
leges. The University Club, as is
well known, never does things by
halves, and we may expect to see a
handsome trophy when all details are
arranged.
