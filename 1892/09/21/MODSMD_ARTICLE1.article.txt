# LECTURE COURSE.
## Second Lecture by President Jordan on Higher Education. 
### 
Dr. Jordan's lecture drew out a very i
large audience last evening, the Chapel
being filled to overflowing. The Presi
dent was introduced by Prof. Swain
and was received with prolonged ap
plause.
His subject, The Value of Higher
Education, was fraught with interest,
especially for the newer students whose
views concerning college work and the j
purposes of the University were en- j
tirely unsettled.
"I wish," said he, "to make a plea
to young men and women for higher ,
education, fora more thorough prepa
ration for the duties of life, and to such
as these, with the life and duties of j
the busy world before them, the best
advice that I or any one else can give j
is this. 'Go to college.' "
What will college do for you?
It may do many things if you are
made of the right stuff, for you cannot
fasten a 82,000 education to a fifty
cent boy. The fool, the dude and (he
shirk come out of college pretty much
as they went in. They dive deep in the
Pierian springs, as the duck dives in
the pond, and they come up as dry as
the duck does. The college will not
do everything for you. It is simply one
of the helps by which you can win
your way to a noble manhood or
womanhood. Whatever you are, you
must make of yourself, but a well-spent
college life is one of the greatest helps
to all good things. It will bring you
in contact with the great minds of the
past, the long roll of those, who through
the ages have borne a mission to young
men and young women, from Plato to
Emerson, from Homer and Euripides
to Schiller and Browning. Your
thought will be limited, not by the
narrow thought of to-day, but the great
men of all ages and all climes will be
come your brothers. Your college
course will bring you in contact with
men whose influences strengthen and
inspire. The ideal college professor
should be the best man in the com
munity. lie should have about him
nothing mean, or paltry or cheap. He
should be to the student as David Cop
perfield's Agnes, "Always pointing the
way upwards." That we are all this,
I shall not pretend Most college pro
fessors whom I know are extremely
human. We have been soured and
starved and dwarfed in many ways,
and many of us are not the men we
might have been it' we had your
chances for early education. But un
practical, pedantic, fossilized, though
the average college professor may be,
his heart is in the right place; he is
not mercenary, and his ideals are those
of culture and progress. Moreover,
the training which comes from associ
ation with one's fellow students can
not be over-estimated. Among out
college students are the best young
men of' the time. They help mould
each other's character and shape each
other's work. Many a college man will
tell you that above all else which the
college gave, he values the friendships

which ho formed in school. Each of!
us owes much to the college, its libra
ries, its labratories, its professors, but i
souiething of the powers of each, as
teacher or as student, has been given
by each of the others. Many a great!
genius has risen and developed in soli-j
tude, ns the Trailing Arbutus grows
in the woods and scorns cultivation, i
Poets sing, because their souls are lull
of music, not because they have learn-!
Ed the gaunt of passions in schools.
But all great work in Science, in Phi
losophy, in the Humanities, has come
from entering into the work of others.
We must stand upon their shoulders,
dwarfs upon the shoulders of the
giants, if we would look further into
the future than they. Science, Phi
losophy, Statesmanship cannot fora
moment let go of the past. The col
lege intensities the individuality of
man.
The educated man has the 'courage
of his convictions, because only he has
any real convictions. He knows how
convictions should be formed. What
he believes he takes on his own evi
dence, not because it is the creed of
i his church or the platform of his party.
: And to help others to see them so is
one .of the greatest services he can
render to the community.
It does not hurt a young man to be
ambitious in some honorable direction.
In the poor-minded youth, ambition is
! the sum of all the virtues. Lack of
ambition means failure from the start.
If you say to yourself, I will be a natur
alist, a traveller, a historian, a states
j man, a scholar; if you never unsay it;
J if you bend all your powers in thatdi
j rection, and take advantage of all those
aids that help toward your ends, and
; reject all that do not, you will some
| time reach your goal. The ivorld turn*
| aside to let any man pas* who knows
j whither he i* going! J)o not say that
I am expecting too much of the effects
lof a firm resolution; that I give you
advice which will lead you to failure.
For the man who will fail will never
make a resolution. Those among you
| whom Fate has out out for nobodies,
1 are the ones who will never try. I said

just now, that you cannot put a 82,000
! education on a fifty-cent boy. 13ut
i what shall we say of a man who puts
' a fifty-cent education on a ten thousand
dollar boy and narrows and cramps
him throughout his after life? And
just this is what ten thousand parents
in California are doing for their sons
and daughters. Twenty years hence,
ten thousand men and women of Cali
fornia will blame them for their .short
ness of sight and narrowness of judg
ment; in weighing a few paltry dollars
soon earned, soon lost, against the
power which comes from mental train
ing. -'Fora man to have died who
might have been wise and was not
this,"says Carlyle, "this I call a
tragedy."
Another thing which should never
be forgotten is this: A college educa
tion is not a scheme to enable a man to
live without work. Its purpose is
to help him to live to advantage —to
make every stroke count. But you
may ask me this question: Will a col
lege education pay, considered
las a financial investment? v\.;>in 1
| must answer yes, but the scholar is
! seldom disposed to look upon hi ; j / > :
as a financial investment. In tl work

of the rank and file of life, it is true I
that the educated man gets the best
salaries. Brain work is harder than
hand work, and it is worth more in any
market and it will always be so. In!
every field from base-ball to statesman-1
ship it is always science that wins the |
game.
What does the college do for the!
moral, the religious training of the!
youth? Let us examine. If your
college assume to stand in loco parentis ]
with rod in hand and spy-glass on its |
nose, it will not do much in the way of
moral training. A college cannot take
the place of the parent. To claim that
it does so is mere pretense. It can cure
the boy of petty vices and childish
trickery only by making him a man,
by giving him higher ideals, more
serious views of life. The college
can do much, but not by rules and
regulations. The college will not make
young men religious by. enforced at
tendance at church or prayer meeting.
It will not awaken the spiritual element
in the student's nature by any system
of demerit marks. This the college can
do for religious culture. It can
strengthen the student in his search
for truth and it can encourage manli
ness in him by the putting away of
j childish things. It is the noblest mis
j sion of higher education, I believe, to
! fill the mind of the youth with lofty
| enthusiasms, with noble ideas of man
; hood, of work, of life. It should teach
him to feel that life is indeed worth
; living, and 110 one who leads a worthy
I life has ever fora moment doubted
this. It should help him to shape his
j own ambitions as to how a life may be
I made worthy. It should help him to
believe that love and friendship and
faith and devotion are things that
really exist, and are embodied in men
' and women. One word more. You
will go to college, for better or for
worse. Where shall you go? The
answer to this is simple. (let the best
you can. You have but one chance
fora college education and you cannot
! a fib nl to waste that chance on third
rate or fouth-rate schools. There is
but one thing that can make a college
| strong and useful, and that is a strong
j and earnest faculty. Go where the
i masters are, in whatever department
! you wish to study.
Let the school do for you all it can,
■ and when you have entered 011 the se
rious duties of life, let your own work
and your own infiuencc in the commu
nity be ever the strongest plea that can
be urged in behalf of the higher edu
i cation.
