# The 						Republican Primary.
## 
### 
Quite au exciting time-was had in
Mayfield yesterday afternoon at the
Republican primary election. The
purpose of the primary was to elect
four delegates from Mayfield precinct
to the County Convention at San Jose.
The Republican Club of the Univer
sity nominated F. L. Cole for one can
didate and the citizens of Mayfield at
a mass meeting Monday night nomi
nated three more. Another ticket
was put up, composed 112 two May
field men and two from Stock Farm.
Up to two o'clock the latter faction
had everything its own way, but
shortly after that time 'bus loads of
University men began to arrive and
things took a decided change before
the polls closed. There were 144
votes cost and the following ticket
was elected by 30 majority: R. L.
Greer, F. L. Cole, J. C. Ponce and E.
A. La Piere,
It would be well if the voters at the
University would rememember that
they are entitled to a vote here, as it
"wus a hard matter yesterday to get
many of them out to exercise their
franchise,
