The meeting of the class of '96 yes
terday afternoon was called to order
promptly at 1:1-3 by Teni. Chairman
Fowler, who stated that the object of
the meeting was to hear the report of
the Committee on Organization. The
committee having read its report, dis
cussion begun and soon the livliest
confusion was established, hi lieu of
not knowing how to proceed, and with
but one-half of the Constitution adopt
ed, the class decided to adjourn until
next Friday at 1.15 p. m. The Char
ter, which is partially adopted by the
class of' 96, allows sixty members to
prevent the call of any meeting. We
would advise them to consider this
matter well before finally adopting it.
This clause would confer unlimited
power for blocking necessery work
upon any clique that might choose to
work it. We can see 110 good results
to come from the adoption of this
part of the Constitution, and great
evil might result from it.
