DIKI)—In Fruitvfile, Monday, Sept. 19th.
at 5:4.) i>. m., Richard Theodore, only*
son of Laura and the late liichard Al
brecht, a native of San Francisco, aged
20 years, 7 months and lit days.
The good fortune was given very
few of his fellow students to know the
full beauty of Richard Albrecht's
character. Quiet and unassuming at
all times, he made few intimate friends
among his associates, but those to
whom the real man was known bear
affectionate witness to the nobility of
his nature, lie walked in the firm
ness of a sincere faith in (iod and the
life to come, and his strong but unob
trusive Christianity was the keynote
of his character.
Manliness is the word most fit in
speaking of Richard Albrecht. To be
in his company was to feel a quiet in
fluence for good. One did not neecl
to know him well to feel the force of
his refinement. In the deepest, truest
sense, Richard Albrecht was a gentle
man.
His is a great loss, greater perhaps
than will ever be known, for Certain
ly there were in him the beginnings
of some noble service to his fellow
men. Loyal to the last degree, with
a deep ambition for the good and true,
lie could ill be spared when such
honest souls are needed,
Dr. Jordan said in his address last
evening that valuable above all else
that the college gives, are the friend
ships made there.
The college paper is the fittest
place for the tribute that is due the
memory of Richard Albrecht, and
through this medium the friends who
know and loved him best would ex
press to the stricken family their sin
cere esteem and sympathy.
IN MKMOUIAM.
liichard Theodore Albrecht.
And when you fell asleep they said
The good die young. Dear college friend '
We who arc left have sometime read
A sweet Philosophy, that is to lend
Us comfort now that, you are dead.
Life is a sleep, 1 lie poets say,
A slow forgetting of t he light
shining from Home upon our way;
All, happy one, ere you had lost it quite,
(iod woke you, saying, "It is Day !"
You woke with the immortal lark,
While we sleep on and dream the years,
And with closed eyelids think it dark;
Gently bstwecu our lashes slip the tears
And each tear flashes back a spark.
—CIIAS. K. Fikld, '11.3.
