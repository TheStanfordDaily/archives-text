# FOOTBALL BENEFIT.
## 
### 
The committee consisting of Messrs,
Baker, Kennedy and Rice, which was
appointed to arrange for an entertain
ment|to secure funds with which to
put the football field in condition, re
port that an excellent musical pro
gram has been prepared. It is in
tended that this entertainment shall
lake place Friday evening, Oct. 7.
Every man who has in him one
spark of college patriotism will lend
his support and encouragement. No
heavy athletic assessments are made
here as there are in other colleges, so
â€¢every one should turn out and show
his appreciation.
Last spring; at Harvard, a fund of
$5,000 was raised by subscription for
the support of the crew alone.
If athletics are to be made a success
at Stanford, those of us who do not
go on the teams must demonstrate
our enthusiasm bv financial contri
butions for their support.
The football field is in sad need of
overhauling. Already the time for
heavy training draws near, and there
are no grounds. The money realized
from a well-attended benefit will be
ample to place the grounds in good
condition. >So when the benefit tak :
place, let every man' come and bring
as many others as he can.
