One of the unpleasant things at
tending the entrance of a new class
into college every year is the appear
ance of their class year on the furni
ture of the recitation rooms. Already
a number of the chairs bear the legend
'96." It is to be hoped that this inde
fensible practice will not become gen
'eral here, and that the present very
neat appearance of the tuniture will
be respected by all.
Foothall practice has begun and
It behooves every man to come out #
especially the new men, There are
many men in the University besides
the thirty who have handed in their
names who are capable of playing
a good game of football. Every
large, muscular man should begin
training at once. More candidates
are required for the center. Even of
those who have signified their inten

the practice grounds. Tueeday
It required considerable effort to ob
tain enough men to play a short
practice game. It cannot be too
stronglv emphasized that no man is
sure of a place on the team. A man's
loyalty to his college should be suffi
cient to induce him to daily hard
work. The news which reaches
us from Berkeley concerning the hard
training done there should call forth
all the zeal and self-sacrifice of every
possible player in the I niversitv.
While on this matter, a word to the
spectators may not be out of place.
Nothing so encourages a player, new
or old, as the presence of a large num
ber <ff college mates watching the
practice. All those who can possibly
spare the time should come out on the
grounds and reward the good plays
bp liberal applause.
