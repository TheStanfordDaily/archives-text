# University league Schedule.

### 
College having opened so inn -h
earlier than it di<l last year, places lis
almost a month ahead of time in ath
letic training. Although the football
players have done no real work as
yet and things seem to be lagging
somewhat, in reality the boys will he
in much finer trim by the middle of
October than were last year's players
in December.
Realizing that there is 110 great
hurry, ami that besides it is hardly
just that the football interest shall
monopolize six months out of the
available eight, the athletic commit
tees are considering the matter of
postponing the playing of reguiar
games for about three weeks. In the
meantime the different classes will
make an effort toj pay off old scores
in the baseball arena. Four clubs
have been formed, one from the Fresh
men, one from the Sophomores, one
from the Upper Class men, and one
from the Faculty.
A trophy for the victors will be
maintained and as this will probably
become the possession 'of either the
Freshmen or Sophomore class, ii will
have great significance and the con
test promises to become a lively one.
The schedule arranged, and which
wiil undoubtedly be accepted, is as
follows:
I'pperClass vs. Sophomore, Fritlny, Sept. '28
h acuity vs. Freshmen .. Saturday, Sept' 24
t'pper Class vs. Freshmen. . Friday, Sept. 30
Faculty vs. Sophomore. Saturday Oct. 1
Faculty vs. tipper ('lass Friday Oct 7
Sophomore vs. Freseme Saturday, Oct 8
