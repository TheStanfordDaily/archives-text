# SEMINARY WORK
## 
### 
Such departments of the University
as had available advanced students
opened seminary courses fur original
and independent investigation last
year. The work was somewhat crip
pled by the lack of much necessary
material, but notwithstanding the
many drawbacks some very creditable
work was done. Prof. Howard tried
to make this work the principal part
of the department of history. The [
seminary met regularly on Tuesday
afternoons, and listened to the dis
cussions of subjects of much interest
to the history students. Frequently
Prof. Howard made use of the hour in
the discussion of topics which could
not be dealt with in connection with
the regular class-room work. He i
often devoted a considerable portion
of the hour in showing how raw ma
terial is worked up into history, and!
jby the use of practical examples,!
[showed how to find facts of import
ance to historians and from these facts
( draw conclusions ami make generali
| zations.
This work was supplemented on the
fact of the members of the seminary
by the preparation of reports, criti
cisms and theses, applying the meth
! ods of work described by the profes
.
sor. Various other lines of a technical
nature were followed, such for instance
as the bibliography of special topics,
what is being done in history, the
methods of different seminaries.
The work this year began last
Tuesday in the history building. After
a discussion of seminary methods by
Profs. Howard and Show, .Mrs. Mary
R. Smith presented a well analysed
report on theories of the Teutonic
village community in the ages of Ta
citus, with particular reference to
Allen's Primitive Democracy of the
Germans. The discussion involved a
critical examination of chapters 16
and '20 of the (Jermania.
Mrs. Smith was followed by Mr. C.
E. Chadsey with u short statement of
1 the views of Allen and Sccbohm, re
lative to the early English town com
munities. The topic announced for
the next meeting is an examination
of the theories of Heebohni, Hanssen
and Conlanges as to the origin of the
" open field system."
