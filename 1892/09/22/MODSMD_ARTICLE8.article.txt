I uesday a practice game was ad
vertised on the bulletin hoard and at
4:.')0 the field was covered with aspi
rants for football fame. The majority
of them were men who had but little
experience on the football field, but
with them was the determination to
be players or know why.
Our old boys do not come out in
force as well as they should, thinking
perhaps that it is better to give the
field to the new boys, but we think
they err in this as they help in show
ing the debutantes how to take ad
vantage of the points of the game as
tackling, scrimmaging etc., still we
hope for the better in the future. The
field is not in first class condition as
yet owing to its hardness, but the
workmen are at it and will soon have
it in fine shape, then we. hope for bet
ter results, The game took place on
the baseball field, its present condition
being better than that of any other
available place.
Of the old players "Clem" Down
ing, and Briggs were all that we no
ticed. These helped to enthuse the
less experienced. The men were di
vided as evenly as possible and in a
few minutes the game was in hot pro
gress. We were agreeably surprised
at the playing of some of the new hoys
who soon showed that we had under
rated their ability. Cochran in his
capacity as left tackle, used his weight
to a great advantage in interfering
and bids fair a place in our college
team. Walton, our old star catcher,
I showed himself as halfback, making
several runs. Kennedy was among the
! spectators but did not take active
part. He is from the Colorado Uni
versity where he has the credit of win
ning several games for his team by his
I individual placing. In an interview
I with a Palo Alto reporter he stated
i that he would be on the field for active
1 practice in a few days. Jones of
Exeter, is a valuable addition to our
talent as lit' has played against several
of the large Eastern Universities.
The best tackle of the day was one
of Cleinans by Walton. He went at
hjin low and hard and brought him
down in fine shape. Cochran's play
ing at guard was good. The teams
played too long for almost the first
time.
