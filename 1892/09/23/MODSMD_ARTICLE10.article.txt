# GRADUATE STUDENTS.
## 
### 
It is to be noted with some satisfac
tion that the University is attracting
a number of advanced students. In
these students we hope to see a repu
tation for scholarship established in
the near future. For the last ten years
Senator Stanford's proposed endow
ment has been the subject of much
talk among educational circles. We
had, at the opening of the University,
several students whose reputations for
scholarship brought looks of favor
upon us. Perhaps no University ever
started under more favorable auspices,
but all these will not build up for us
a respect like that which will follow
upon our production of ripe scholars.
It is also noteworthy that most of
our graduate students are from Eastern
Universities.
