Walking now is quite pleasant
about the hills surrounding Palo Alto.
The roads are a little dusty yet it is
true, but what of that? Dust is easily
brushed and washed off and then one
is all the better for it. The hills ever
brown are always tempting you farther
and farther amongst them. Nesting
among the hills a farm house is often
to be found. Here a student is nearly
always welcome. A bunch of grapes,
a drink of milk during a walk is a de
light that must be tried to be appreci
ated, Try taking a good long walk
the first Saturday you have time.
The young ladies of the Koble have
reorganized their Mouse Committee
which under the presidency of Miss
Cora Glidden, took charge of all mat
ters of hall interest last year. Miss
Lizzie Chapman has been elected
president tor the ensuing year.
The stock farm is quite an attrac
tion for the students. Every Saturday
scores of them can be seen wandering
through the stables asking "fool ques
tions" of the attendants. We miss the
fiery eye of Palo Alto, however.
