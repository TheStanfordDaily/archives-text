Just back of the wood-working shop
is to he the foundry building. The
foundation is completed. It is made
of solid concrete eighteen inches thick
and six feet in height, a little over
three feet being underground. The
building is to be two hundred feet
long and forty feet wide. The walls
will be made of red brick laid so as to
secure the greatest strength and firm
ness. The old English bond, that is,
small bent iron strengtheners placed
between every six courses, will he
used in the brick work. The roofing
will be of terra cota tileing similar to
the roofing of all the other buildings
about the quadrangle. Within, the
building will be divided into three
parts, on the right, the foundry, in the
middle, the blacksmith shops, and on
the left the pipe cutting shop.
The contract was let last Monday to
a San Jose firm for the masonry work
on a new power house. The building
will be made of stone and concrete. It
