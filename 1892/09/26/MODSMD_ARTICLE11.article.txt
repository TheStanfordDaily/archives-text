"The fearful football player," whom
Shakespeare speaks ot, has evidently a
prototype in the Olympic Club's team.
The other evening a meeting of the
representatives from the various col
leges and athletic clubs was held for
the purpose of organizing a league to
play during the season. The idea is
Joe Tobin's, and I have no doubt a.
series of games at intervals throughout
the winter would be productive of
great interest and be well patronized
by the G. P. The Berkeley men, the
Napa men, a n d the others all signified
their willingness to join—only the
Stanford representatives exhibited no
enthusiasm. Being asked to come in
they refused point blank. Reasons
they declined to give. Being pressed,
however, one of them said he objected
to the rough play of the Olympic men.
"In that game we played with you
last seaeon," he said, "one of your men
slugged a divinity student on our
team."
"Well, what then? 'Tgint a game
for babies, is it ? " asked an Olympic
man.
"What then ! " continued the youth
in horrified tones. "Why, the student
got angry and swore, thereby imperil
ing his soul and demoralizing him ut
terly."
The roar of laughter that followed
this sanctimonious objection drowned
some further remarks the good youth
desired to make. After that they were
not pressed to remain and retired amid
jeers.— Wasp.
No, it is not a game for babies, nor
is it a game for toughs as was well
proved last year. Stanford's team is
proud of being at the same time gentle
men and champions.
