# MR. RIDDLE IN HAMLET.
## 
### 
Prof. Anderson has had cards
printed announcing next Thursday as
the date upon which Mr. Riddle will
read Hamlet. Nearly everyone has
heard of Mr. Riddle, and knows that
he is one of the most talented readers
in the country. Below is a clipping
from the Boston Advertiser.
From the Boston Daily Advertiser.—
•' Mr. Riddle's reading of "Hamlet"
is the best thing he has yet done; and
to say that one reads "Hamlet" better
than anything else is in itself high
praise. The play is so well known to
everybody that the common standard
is a high one; and the apprehension of
its difficulties and the great demands
it makes, render us intolerant of medi
ocrity. The whole conception of
Hamlet—and Mr. Riddle's admirable
cutting is such as to make Hamlet
himself, even more than is usual, the
motive of the play—is so clear and
consistent that it goes far to reconcile
the ever recurring doubts that beset
every student of his character. The
very integrity of his conception makes
it difficult to say just where it is best;
each changing phase grows so naturally
out of the one before it that to isolate
anyone is to take away a part of its
beauty and trouble its transparency.
Particularly satisfactory however was
the rendering of Hamlet's words to his
friends after the ghost had left him—
those "wild and whirling words" are
not such to us, who can but see in them
the fit and tender shielding of the love
and sorrow that will bear no stranger's
touch, that will not suffer even a com
ment on the wrong that has forced
that honored form to burst the holy
silence of the grave, while the swift,
earnest aside to Horatio, distinguishes
him alone. Indeed, it may be that
this love for his father, which informs
every line of Mr. Riddle's reading—
proud when he may praise him to his
friend, pitiful when he remembers the
gentleness to his mother, and growing
with rapture as he gazes on his pictured
form—is the thing which harmonizes
the whole and seperates this Hamlet
from others.
