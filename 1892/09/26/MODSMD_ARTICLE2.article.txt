# SUNDAY ADDRESS.

### 
The regular Sunday morning ad- 1
dress was given by Prof. Anderson in
the Chapel yesterday. It was a lecture
of interest and profit, and one which
the large audience listened to with at- J
tention. The subject, as announced,
was "The Religious Views of Emer- j
son."
As a prefacc, Prof, Anderson briefly I
refered to the formative influences |
which affected Emerson as a boy, sup
plementing the discourse by quotations |
from Emerson's works. Inreferingto
his life the speaker showed care in the I
selection of such anecdotes as would
best characterize the religious and
| ethical views ot the great philosopher, i
Emerson left the Unitarian pulpit
because even that libeal church too
much confined him in what lie be- j
lieved to be the true religion. He was j
opposed to all forms of ritualism and
even the Sacrament ot the Lord's sup
per was an insincerity to him. The
thoughts along these lines produced
the poem entitled the Problem.
The word views as it appeared in the
title of the discourse was used advised
ly. Emerson's views on religious sub
jects were not like those of Kant or
Decartes. His ideas were what he
viewed in himself. He got them by
| intuition not tuition. His view was
i insight. He testified himself that his
! will never gave his mind the ideas
j they take. With an eye that was in
; ward turned he saw certain beautiful
i spiritual laws which he believed to be
j universal laws. He taught that to the
j good, the pure and the sincere all
stumbling blocks prove to be stepping
' stones.
In conclusion Prof. Anderson gave
some generalizations concerning the j
i great philosopher. If Swedenbourg |
was a God-intoxicated man, then Em
i
I erson was a God-sobered man. He was
not controversal hut a meek, kind
and good philosopher. As he said of
I himself he was more of a Quaker than
! anything else.
