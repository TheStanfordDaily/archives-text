# THE
						FRESHMEN ORGANIZE

I be class of "96 perfected its organ
ization Friday afternoon. The cur
tains were drawn and the doors wore
carefully guarded, but '95 offered no
opposition. Once only did that name
produce consternation—once when a
young lady, rising, excitedly gave the
startling information that a '95 man
was present. 'Twas a false alarm how
ever.
The constitution adopted after vari
ous amendments is full and definite in
its provision. Ten members can call
a meeting. The clause permitting
sixty members to prevent a meeting
was stricken from the constitution.
The baseball and football managers
have unrestricted power in the ap
pointment of players and captains. It
would seem however; that it would be
far more satisfactory to the players,
and a right that should not be .denied
them for them, themselves, to choose
their captains.
After the adoption of the constitu
tion ten minutes were given to take
breath and sign that document, after
which the election of officers com
menced.
By the time three out of the party,
nine candidates for president were
nominated, Parliamentary proceedings
became so inextricably entangled that
the chairman threw up his hands in
despair and ordered the nominations
jto begin over again. Three gentle
| men had no sooner been nominated
I than another difficulty presented
itself—a young lady objected to
them—she did not know them. Forth
j with, said candidates were ordered to
exhibit themselves on the platform
where, no doubt WAV. Guth made the
best appearance, as he was chosen
president.
Iwo young ladies were nominated
for first vice-president, and a member
of the other side of the house, not to
be outdone, vulgarly asked permission
jto "gaze upon the candidates." The
| young ladies were therefore escorted
|to the platform to be "gazed upon."
1 his custom became the order of the
I election, and in one instanco an un
fortunate candidate had the doubtful
satisfaction of beinqj "gazed upon,"
while his absent opponent walked off
with the office.
The election of officers resulted as
j follows: President, \V. \V. Guth;
j Ist Vice-President, Miss Nelly M. Hill,
I2d Vice-President, Miss Helen Willis;
Treasurer, Henry Harris; Hergeant
at-arms, Mr. Murphy; Baseball Man
ager, \V. L. McLaine; Football Man
ager, E. ('. .lone-.
The temporary chairman and
temporary secretary received a vote of
thanks, and a committee of three were
appointed on class yell.
