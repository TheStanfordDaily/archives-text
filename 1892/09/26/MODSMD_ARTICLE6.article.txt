William Henry Hudson, associate
professor of' English, was born in Lon
don in 1863, and received his early
education at home under private tu
tors. While still a boy he felt strong
inclinations towards public life, and
began by lecturing in various parts of
England upon literary and political
questions. At the time of Charles
Bradlaugh's memorable struggle in
the House of Commons in regard to
taking the oath of office, Prof. Hudson
was his constant supporter and friend
and by his writing and speaking ren
dered him valuable assistance. On
one occasion, at a great mass meeting
in Bristol, Prof. Hudson spoke with
Mr. Bradlaugh receiving high praise
from the commoner for his able effort.
The struggle ended with the untimely
death of Mr. Bradlaugh, and Prof.
Hudson went abroad, traveling for
more than a year in the United States,
Canada and other countries. On his
return to England, he became private
secretary to Herbert Spencer, being
directly associated with the great phil
osopher for several years, and has ever
since been his intimate friend. It was
at this time that he became connected
with the London press, his literary
and journalistic work bringing him in
contact with many of the best known
literary men of the day and from that
time onward he has been a contributor
to many English and American maga
zines. Prof. Hudson also became in
terested in library work and in 1890
at the personal request of ex-President
Andrew D. White, returned to this
country to undertake the cataloging
of that historian's immense collection
of works on the French Revolution.
This catalogue is now in press. .Subse
quently he became assistant librarian
iit Cornell and, after refusing various
offers from other universities, accepted
that tendered by Dr. Jordan and
came to Palo Alto. Prof. Hudson is
already deeply interested in his work
here, and expresses himself as delight
ed with this great University of the far
