# ROBLE RECEPTION.
## A 						General Boycott Proclaimed Against the Encinaites. 
### 
It was u decidedly sleepy and lan
quid looking set of young ladies who
put in an appearance ut breakfast
Sunday morning, and even such rari
ties as scrambled eggs and milk-toast
failed to bring a smile to their pale
and haggard countenances.
We have heard it said that there is
always a calm after a storm. This
was certainly the case on Sunday and
it was caused by no less event than a
full dress ball given by last year's
Roble maidens to this year's Roble
maidens. This being the first social
event of the season caused quite a
little stir among the inmates of Hoble,
and the day was spent in great prepa
rations for the event. Whv, some
young ladies even went to San Jose
and intrusted themselves to the tender
mercies of the huir dresser.
A little after seven o'clock n com
mittee of two, self appointed, went to
the parlor and removed therefrom
chairs and carpets.
At a quarter of eight the guests be
gan to arrive by twos, by threes, and
even by the dozens.
Promptly at 8 o'clock the music
' struck up and the grand march was
! quickly formed.
It docs not often fall to the lot of
man to behold at one time so much
beauty as was displayed during the
i grand march. There were brunettes
1 with raven locks and with eyes which
outshone the diamond, and there in
| opposition to them were their sisters
whose eyes were as blue as the heavens.
Some of the dresses worn were
i simply gorgeous, being for the most
part silk, and as for jewels, why the
' room actually blazed with them.
The floor was very crowded, but of
' course the more the merrier, so we
I heroically endured having our toes
I stepped on and our eyes nearly put out.
Those who did not dance willingly
played ihe part of wall-flowers.
Dancing was kept up until 10:30,
; when the guests were compelled to de
part, owing to the fact that the lights
| went out. Thus ended the first dance
at Roble.
