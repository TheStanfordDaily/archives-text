It lias been .suggested by one of the
Professors that the large new black
i bulletin board be painted a pale buff
color or some shade nearer that of the
j stone work to which it is attached. It

by such an evident black patch upon

i only see the new ones more readily,
but they would also be saved the
i trouble of reading others only to find
out that they were stale.
