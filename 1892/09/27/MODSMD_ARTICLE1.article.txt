# Students' Congress.
## 
### 
The Students' Congress met in regu
lar session last Saturday evening. The
Congress was called to order by Mr.
Cathcart who stated that as the speaker
of the house was absent, the election
of a speaker pro tem was in order. On
motion of Mr. Rose, Mr, E. R. Zion
took the chair. The chief business of
the evening was the election of the j
President of the United States. There
were four candidates in the field, viz.:
Profs. Barnes, Swain, Marx and
Brown. As the first ballot gave no j
majority, the names of Marx and
Brown were dropped. The next
ballot gave a result of thirteen states
for Barnes and eight for Swain. As
it takes a majority of states to elect,
and it was now clear that there could
be no election that evening, the Con
gress adjourned. The constitution
says that the President of the United
States must be elected at the second
meeting of the year. This has not
been done. Members will please all
come out nexe Saturday night and de
termine what is the best thing to do
under the circumstances.
