# HIGH SCHOOL HISTORY.
## 
### 
The mutter printed below was
clipped from the Acgin, the Oakland
High School paper. It shows on the
part of the writer, good, sound sense,
and the questions which it asks are
those which the High School teacher
in other cities besides Oakland should
consider well. The fact is undeniable,
that the history work done in the
high schools of this State is far below
the average. The fault probably lies
in the position taken by the professors
of the State University, who set the
paca for the preparatory schools of the
State. The U. C. has done good
work in history, but its requirements
for entrance in this branch have been
for years little better than a farce.
Stanford University opened upon
the Ctli and quite a number of the O.
H. S. graduates presented themselves
Tor admission. Many of them coukl
not enter in full standing because they
were not well-grounded in history.
Not that they did not possess a
thorough knowledge of what they had
been taught—there is no reason for
.supposing that. The scanty allowance
of history which the High School doles
out to its students, goes as far towards
iitting their needs as able instruction,
hampered by a poor arrangement of
curses can. J3ut the preparation for
Stanford requires something like twice
as much history as the High School pu
pil receives. In Grecian and Roman
history there is but little fault to be
found* but the time expended here upon
English history —six months in the
Junior year—is totally inadequate.
United States history, beyond what we
learn in government, is not touched
upon at all. And yet in both of these
branches, a ligid eqamination must be
undergone by the applicant for ad
mission into Stanford. There is a
radical error in the system, not of
Stanford, which only demands its just
due, in asking fora thorough under
standing of the rudiments of history,
but of the High School, which seems
to give almost every study in its
course a position of importance over
liissory. But why should not as much
attention be devoted to history, as to
English, which is taught every term ?—
or at least, why should not the student
desirous of a thorough preparation, be
allowed to substitute history for some
of the studies taken up for only six
months, and which are of no use to
him, either in his university education
or his business career ?
