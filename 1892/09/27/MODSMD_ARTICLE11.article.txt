Metcalf, '95, attempted to run the
gauntlet Sunday noon and to obtain
a free luncheon at Encina. While
boasting of his success the steward
gently tapped him on the shoulder
and told him that he was wanted at
the office. A minute later with a very
weak smile he passed out the front
door remarking that he had beeu
charged twenty-five cents a piece for
the two pieces of pie which he had
eaten. We might add that the real
gauntlet did not lie in the steward's
vigilance.
Owing to the large number of stu
dents distributed over Mayfield, Palo
Alto and the dormitories, considerable
trouble has been experienced with the
mails. A great-many letters directed
to the students now lie in the postoflice
at Palo Alto, and some have been
there for many days. We would ad
vise all who have been expecting mail
that they have failed to get, to call
there, as it is probably among the
numerous unclaimed still accumulat
ing.
The young ladies of Roble and the
professors living in the Row were
