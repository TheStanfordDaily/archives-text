## BRAIN POWER. 
### 
The Wonderful Intellect Accompanying
One of the Lightest of Uuuiuu Brains.
Dr. Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, an Eng- i
lish woman, in arguing the question of
"sex in education," accepts for the sake of
argument the assertion that allowing for |
the difference in bodily size of the average '
woman and ike average man it will still
be found that the woman's brain is
the smaller. But Dr. Anderson thinks that J
the evidence in support of the assertion is
strangely inconclusive, for the average j
woman does not have her brain weighed I
at all. She dies comfortably in her own
bed and is duly buried with her skull in
tact. The women whose brains Dr.
Crichton Browne has been able to weigh
and examine belong almost exclusively to
the poorest class., They are women whom
poverty has driven to die among the cold
comforts of workhouse or hospital, and
whose friends, if they had any, are care
less to claim their bodies. To generalize
about all women and men from an exam
ination of the brains of a few individuals
belonging to this poorest and least intel
lectual classes seems distinctly unscien
tific.
There is a further assumption that the
power of the brain is necessarily propor
tional to the size of the brain. This as
sumption sounds plausible, but that is the
most that can be claimed for it. There is
absolutely no proof that a small brain im
plies intellectual weakness. And indeed
there can be no proof. In order to ascer
tain the intellectual strength of any indi
viduals it is necessary to observe them for
a considerable part of a lifetime, and
above all for that part of their lives when
they are in the fullest health. But obvi
ously it is impossible fora doctor to make
a practice of watching his healthy neigh
bors in order to ascertain their brain
power, and then the moment they are dead
pounce upon their skulls to weigh the con
tents.
In one famous case something analogous
to this was done with the most remarkable
results. The brain of Sir Isaac Newton,
who, as his epitaph tells, "in intellectual
power surpassed the human race," was
weighed and the scales showed that it wa9
one of the lightest that had ever been
found within a human skull. Conse
quently when medical men assert that
women's brains are less than men's, and
infer a proportional inferiority of intellect,
the first answer is that neither the assertion
nor the inference is supported by sufficient
evidence.
Dr. Anderson also ingeniously suggests
that if men's brains are bigger it may be
because women's brains are used less.
This completely inverts the argument.
Instead of asserting that women cannot do
intellectual work because their brains are
too small we may equally well argue that
women's brains are small because they do
too little intellectual work.
