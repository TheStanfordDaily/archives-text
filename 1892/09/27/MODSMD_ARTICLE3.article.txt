# Math. and Astronomical Club.

### 
The Mathematical and Astronomical
Club meets at 7:30 Wednesday evening
instead of Thursday on account of the
latter date conflicting with the en
gagement of Mr. Geo. Riddle in Ham
let. The greater part of the evening
will be occupied by Prof. Allardice
who will give a sketch of the history
of geometry.
