The most noticeable thing was the
absence of heavy men. There are a
great many big muscular men im the
college who are capable of playing
tootball and they niu-t begin to train
it they wish their college to win this
year. The importance of the daily
runs must also he emphasized. Not
half the men followed Captain
Clemans across the fields yesterday.
The runs are not long and the pace is
slow. Let every man show his earnest
ness hereafter by pulling on his sweater
and joining in the runs every day.
