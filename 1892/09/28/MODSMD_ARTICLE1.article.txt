# Expenses at Harvard.
## 
### 
It is not true thas the cost of living j
there is greater than any other college. |
If the superior advantages received in j
return for such an outlay (those of j
Harvard and of Boston with its library, i
its nuisueum, its cheap concerts, art
galleries, etc.) be taken into considera
tion, it is really smaller than at Wil
liams or even Yale. The following
official table of expenditures, which
does not include clothing or washing
is conceded to be as accurate as pos
sible:

Total $172 $472 $622 ยง1,010 ;
For certain laboratory courses addi
tional fees for breakage, etc., are
charged. Board at Memorial Hall
(which holds 1,000 men) averages 1
$4.05 a week. At the Co-operative I
I* oxcroft Club the price of board is
ยง2.50 to S3 a week, with accommoda
tions for '300. By use of this club's I
reading-room and reference library,
members are enabled to lodge cheaply
at a distance from the University.
I udoubtedly room-rent is excessive
in the dormitories at Harvard, there
being a great lack of moderate-priced
rooms. Nevertheless, (here are twenty
five double and single rooms under
$50, 14G under $75, and 188 under
$100. Besides these there are numbers
of rooms to be had in private houses
about Cambridge, which vary in prices
as their distance from the college.
Pecuniary aid to the large amount
of $50,000 is annually given to good
students, of which sum $31,095 forms
the income of 129 scholarships. The
rest consists of money prizes and
awards, such as prizes for elocution, I
theses, translations, etc. The scholar- j
ships are awarded only to those really '
needy, and who give promise of future j
usefulness.
