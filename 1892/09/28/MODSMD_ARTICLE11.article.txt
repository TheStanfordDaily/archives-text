# Tuesday's Lecture.

### 
Ihe lecture Tuesday evening was
given by Prof. Fernando San ford upon
"Ihe \ ulue of Scientific Knowledge."
1 rof. Sanford treated the subject
mainly from its practical value in life.
Prefacing his lecture, however, bv say
ing that he considered a scientific edu
cation of more value as a training for
the mind than from its practical uses.
He then compared the progress of
the different industries and professions
showing how each"had advanced as it
had introduced science into its train
ing. Some interesting facts were
brought out showing the waste in ag
ricultural products from a lack of an
elementary knowledge in zoolog"; also
the wholesale destructions of foi*ests,
which has already made deserts of a
million square miles of Western
Europe, was shown to be needless
waste of wealth that could easily be
avoided.
Teaching of to-day w
with medicine of years â€¢/hen
each doctor had his own nostrums for
each disease. Ihe medical profession
has improved by the introduction of
science. So must the teacher improve
in his calling by the study of the sci
entific principles which underlie teach
ing.
Theology was criticised for its oppo
sition to science. Scientific studies
were discouraged instead of reecom
mended for the divinity student. In
stead of this, theology should welcome
the scientist, for every recognized truth
was established by science and not by
opposition to it.
The necessity of scientific knowledge
for all who must in any way earn their
own living was clearly shown. In
whatever calling we may choose, sci
entific principles must be the founda
tion. On this hangs successor failure.
