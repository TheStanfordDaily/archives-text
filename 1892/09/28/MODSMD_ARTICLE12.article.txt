# Timothy Hopkins' Gift.
## 
### 
Mr. Timothy Hopkins, who is at
present in London, has sent to the
library a very valuable list of books,
numberingabout one hundred volumes.
A few of the hooks, are to be *
placed in the Hopkins collection of
railway and economic literature. The
majority, however, are very choice
and rare works, long ago out of print,
and very difficult to obtain. Such
books as these are what make a library
ready valuable, both from a point
of view of their intrinsic value,
and their worth in money. Mr. Hop
kins expended a large amount of
money and time in procuring this
gtft. A few such additions will mÂ»oji
make our library one of reknown.

It would be a great accomniodatiou
to those who liave lockers on the first
floor in ii/iicina Gymnasium to have
Ihe extra apparatus removed from the
passage ways.
