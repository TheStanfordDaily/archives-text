There was never any worthy object
accomplished without work. This is
particularly true on the athletic field,
it takes work—good, solid work to
succeed. There is no question about
desire to succeed in football. We
•veed if it is in our power.
But does not rest with the
the captain or the team
■alone. It rests with the entire Uni
versity. If you know a man who may
•develop ii<# a grand player make it
your business to get him out. New
fields will be made as fast as they are
demanded, and remember that it is
not for this season alone that we are
training. We are building for the
future. A man who trains this year
will be that much nearer the team
next. We repeat, it takes work to
succeed.
