second thought such a scheme will not
seem so highly impracticable after nil.
Fora practical illustration of what is
! intended in these remarks take a
building, say, two-thirds as large as
Lauro Hall, three stories high. Let
! the first floor have a room fixed up
! with shower baths, a waiting or rub
j bing down room litted up with cots for
the men to use between halves, after
games or on field days. Another
room fora parlor or library should be
supplied with athletic literature. On
the second floor have a dining room
with kitchen large enough to accom
modate a training table of twenty
five. The rest of this floor and the
third arranged into bed rooms. These
latter might be rented when the teams
are not in trainirg and yield in this
way quite a little revenue. On the
outside have two balconies arranged
to overlook the the athletic fields, thus
supplying a much needed convenience
in the shape of a grand stand. Now
the rent of the rooms and income
| from board would go quite a way
| toward paying for the rent of such a
I house. The cost of a house like this,
j and to which several of our fraternity
houses are simi ar, would not at far
thermost be beyond $10,100. If fra
ternities can have such houses why
not our athletic association? Perhaps
if we show ourselves really interested
iu such a venture some generous friend
of the university will help us out by
kindly giving us a fund to pay the
ental. It is not a visionary project if
we look at it from the right standpoint.
At present what we need is two or three
zealous workers to take hold of and
carry out to completion the plan. Who
will be the men to start the ball rolling?
