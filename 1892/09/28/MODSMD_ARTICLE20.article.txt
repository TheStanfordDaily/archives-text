The Sophomore Class and the Asso
ciated Students both have passed
resolutions to the intent that the Fac
ulty's suspension of George L. Jones,
'95, is too severe a punishment. The
Sophomore Class appointed a com
mittee to try to obtain a reconsider
ation of the case as a whole.
One ot the bricklayers working on
the new buildings fell from the
scaffolding yesterday afternoon and
broke his arm in two places.
It is reported that Jack Sheehan,
Sam Simmons, Louis Smith, Clemens,
Paul Downing and several others now
at Encina will take up quarters in the
new hotel at I'alo Alto as soon as it is
completed.
