# MR. RIDDLE'S HAMLET.
## 
### 
Large bulletins have been posted
announcing the reading of Hamlet by |
Mr. Riddle next Thursday evening.
This will be one of the events of the
year, and it is expected that the chapel
will be filled. Prof. Anderson has
invited Mr. Riddle to read Hamlet
here and give the students of Shakes- i
peare an opportunity to hear the play
interpreted by a good authority. Mr.
Riddle has been a fine actor, and his
reading will be equivalent to seeing j
the play performed by a good troupe.
Mr. Riddle is aj graduate of Harvard
in the class of '74, and made his first
appearance as a reader in Boston in i
that year. In 1875 he made his debut;
as an actor in that city, playing Ro
meo, after which he became connected
with stock companies in Boston, Mon
treal and Philadelphia. From 1878
to I<SBl he was teacher of elocution at,
Ilarvard.
i
All classical students will remember
the production of the (Edipusat Har- I
vard as the first production in this
country of a Greek play in the origi-;
mil. The play owed its great success J
to Mr. Riddle, who managed it and
• • l
played the principal part. Since that
time his frequent calls from the public
so occupied his time that he was com
pelled to leave Harvard. His reading
of the poets are greatly appreciated,
and large audiences meet him wher
ever he goes.
