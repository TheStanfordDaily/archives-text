# A 						New Athelete.
## 
### 
Application for admission to the
University was made yesterday by Mr.
(J. A. Campbell of the Oakland High
School. Mr. Campbell is very favor
ably known to many of the students
as an athelete who will make a great
addition to the University. He played
left-field with the Reliancc nine against
our team last spring. He is a good
all-around player, but his position is
in the box. Catcher Walton says he
has the most puzzling curves of any
pitcher lie ever saw among amateurs.
Combining this excellent quality, with
exceptional speed and good control, he
is beyond doubt the best pitcher who
will play in the league.
