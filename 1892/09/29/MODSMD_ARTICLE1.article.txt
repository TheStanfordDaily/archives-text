# THE
						UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO
## PLANS OF THE UNIVERSITY WHICH IS NOW ATTRACTING ATTENTION. 
### 
AVe feel an interest in this new Uni
versity because it succeeds us as the
baby institution of America. We feel
an interest in it because, like us, it
embodies new ideas of higher educa
tion in this country. But, however,
great interest is shown in its founda
tion, it is noticeable that very little is
known about its plans and workings.
Nearly every one has heard of the cele
brated professors who have been called
to Chicago and the amount of wealth
it has, but very few have any definite
knowledge of its characteristic features
which make it a factor in the educa
tional world. In view of this indis
tinct knowledge we turn a little aside
from our customary line of publica
tion and attempt to give in concise
from what may be of interest concern
ing the new Chicago I'Diversity. The
items are taken from The Nation of
September 22d.
The CDiversity of Chicago (this is
the exact title) is typically American
in the dash and vim with which it
starts. Without doubt a great deal
has been done for the sake of adver
tising, though this i< not academic we
are so accustomed to it in America
that it is almost necessary for success.
Many of the devices are so new and
untried that it is probable that the
plans now projected will have to be
changed when the University has
made a fair trial of them.
There are to be tw > departments as
in other Universities, the graduate and
undergraduate or college departments,
but the hitter ' curiously divided into
the "Academic College" and the
" University College." What is known
in the most American colleges as the
Freshman and Sophomore classes com
prise the former and the Junior, and
Senior comprise the latter. In these
two col eges there have been grouped
the courses of stud} into three groups
leading to the degrees of A. 8., B. S.
and Ph. B. The groups really are
what arc commonly known as courses
but they are designated as colleges.
Thus we have six colleges, three Aca
demic and three University; and two
more are projected in view of creating
a course in technology.
Within three groups of courses the
familiar curricula are met. To get the
degree of A. B. the student must de
vote more than half of his
freshman and sophomore years to
Greek, Latin and mathematics and
at least one-third of his junior and
senior years to mathematics, languages
and political science. For the degree
of Ph. B. the Greek is omitted, the
amount of mathematics diminished,
while the amount of modern languages
