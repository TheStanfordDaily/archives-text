In another column will be found
some little description of the plan of
work in the University of Chicago.
In reading it over, there is suggested
at once, many objections to it, but we
ought to consider fora few moments
before we venture our criticism. Let
us think of how many times we have
had to defend our own University and
its administration because its plans
were a little in advance of the Univer
sities of this country. They are try
ing to work out a reaction against
some old ideas in education, and if
they swing to far, some force will
bring them back. It is difficult to
estimate the exact influence which the
Universities of Chicago and Stanford
are to exercise in the educational
world, but it is, at all events a great
one. Many eyes are turned to us
both, some in favor, some in doubt as
to just what the result will be when
the wind of freedom blows.
