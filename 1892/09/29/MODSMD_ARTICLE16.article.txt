We need a postoffiee. The regis
trar's office is open only part of the
time, the co-op. store but a few hours
each clay, and the mail system at the
halls is very slow. Student mail ad
dressed to Palo Alto has to go through
one or all of these places before it
reaches the owner. A post office ought
to pay. There are 640 students, about
100 in the faculty including their
families and nearly a half hundred
other persons around the campus.
