### 
In William Joseph Hussey, assist
| ant professor of astronomy, the L. S.
Jr. U, has been fortunate in securing
! another of the rising educators, whose
abilities are recognized and whose
j reputation is already assured. He
| was born in Ohio in 1862, and in '82
I entered the civil engineering ct ur.?e at
: the University of Michigan. At the
i close of his sophomore year Prof. Hus-
I sey left college, and for the next three
I years was principal of the Ohio, 111.,
schools. In'B7 he returned to finish
his course at the University of Michi
gan, graduating in '89. Immediately
after graduation Prof. Hussey became
connected with the nautical almanac
office in Washington, his work being
an investigation of the errors of the
I Greenwich solar and planetary ob
servations from 1812 to 1820, and
la re-reduction of them in accordance
with modern data. In the fall of'B9
lie returned to Ann Arbor and was
appointed instructor in mathematics,
and two years later at his own re
f quest was transferred to the depart
ment of astronomy. When Prof. Har
rington became Chief of the Weather
j Bureau the regents appointed I'rof.
Hussey acting director of the ob
| servatory in his stead. Coming to
California this summer Prof. Hussey
has spent a portion of his time at the
Lick Observatory where the famous
observations of Mars through the
large telescope have been in progress.
Working with Profs. Campbell and
Schaeberle they made drawings of the
planet and measurements of its surface
j features. In this connection may be
| mentioned an interesting article from
his pen entitled "The Present Opposi
tion," which appears in the September
| number of The Student.
We take the following from a short
! sketch of Prof. Hussey by the U. of
I m: 's correspondent ot the Detroit Even
ing Neiv*:
" Last fall Mr. Hussey issued from
the Inland Press, of Ann Arbor, 'Log
arithmetic and other Mathematical
| Tables,' which was immediately put
, into use in the mathematical depart
-1 ment, and a second editition called
i for before the end of the first semester.
His last work is a translation from the
German with Prof. Harrington of the
!'Mathematical Theory of Planetary
i Motions,' which will soon appeal 1 . Mr.
Hussey is one of the faculty whom the
i University expect to see rise. With
fine intellectual endowments and the
j genius of industry he has every requi
site for success in his line of sci
j entific work.
