### 
The Mathematical and Astronom
ical Club met last evening instead of
Thursday, in order to accomodate
those who wish to attend the reading
of Hamlet. Prof. Allerdice read a
paper on the history of geometry, after
which there was a business meeting of
the club. It was decided to hold
meetings at 7:25 o'clock regularly
every Thursday evening. The club
was divided into three sections for the
purpose of discussion. This will en
able everyone to take active part in
the work once in three weeks.
