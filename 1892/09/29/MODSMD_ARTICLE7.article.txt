# Faculty Gymnasium Classes.
## 
### 
The following members of the fac
ulty met at the gymnasium last night
to form a class for regular work:
Marx, Sanford, Richardson, Gilbert,
Elliott, Pease, Griffin, Buchanan, Bry
ant, Clarke, Sampson, Brown, McFar
land, Taylor, Green and Stearns.
It was decided to meet every Mon
day and Thursday evenings from 8 to
9 o'clock. The kour will be devoted
to class work and general exercise on
the apparatus under the directi' n of
Mr. Black.
The noticeable movement of the en
tire University toward regular and
systematic work in physical training
is, indeed, encouraging, and results
will surely follow both in the class
room and on the field.
