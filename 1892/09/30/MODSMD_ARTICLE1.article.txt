# College Society.

If there is any department of Col- <
lege life that needs a boom more than
another it is our College Society.
During the first year it was the ex
pressed wish of the founders that this;
be severely kept in the back-ground;
that the precedent for following years
would be hard, conscientious work,
and that any of that uncertain atmos
sphere which naturally envelopes a
new enterprise of this nature would
have time to pass away, and the cer
tainty of the University purposes!
established. There is no longer any 1
need of such a rigid boycott of the
pleasures which are naturally incident
to college life, and it has been entirely ;
removed.
The value of social culture to all is j
but secondary to the main work in the
University. It is the pride of many j
great universities that they graduate
men who are at the same time schol
arly and polishedâ€”indeed, half of the j
institutions which surround every 1
great institution are for no other pur
pose than to cultivate in its members;
that degree of culture which will make j
a man able to appear for what he is,
to give grace, ease and power to all
his intercourse with his fellow beings.
This should be the heritage of every
American boy, but sadly enough
this is not the case, and many not
finding it in college will be forever
handicapped by rough or rude man
ners which but hide the true worth
and tender sympathy that his heart
cherishes.
One of last year's graduates, who
was noted for his unceasing devotion
to his studies and for the manner in
which he cut all society, said a tew
evenings ago : " I am going to join the
society of my friends all I can this
year, for 1 find that one can do just as
good work in college and lose just as
little time as though he became a
recluse. Last year I was a fool,
and I think that I lost in
my own enjoyment and in the sympa
thy for others for more than was
gained." We must associate with men
during our entire life time, and to be
able to read and judge them is in it
self an education and one which is
practical as well.
The Palo Alto is thoroughly in
earnest in its plea for some social ac
tivity, and will gladly keep and fur
ther any plan that will promote it.
At present there is considerable dis
cussion concerning a dance which is
to be given by the different members
of the fraternities. It is the plan of
the committee to get the dinning-room
of Encina Hall for the occasion, as it
would be large and convenient. There
would be but little trouble occasioned
in removing the tables, and the floor

is an excellent one. If the room
can be secured the success of the
ball will be assured. In case it can
not, the gymnasium must be brought
into service. This plan is by no
means all that could be desired, as
many of the University men are not
fraternity men, but at present it is the
only feasible plan presented for the
Jir*t ball, and it is the only manner in (
which the small rooms could be kept i
from a jam. There will be a meeting*)
of the fraternity men next Tuesday (
afternoon, in Encina Parlor, at 3:30,
to discuss the arrangements and to
perfect plans.
