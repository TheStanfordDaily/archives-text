# VANDALISM in college.
## 
### 
Among true college men there is
always a spirit of pride awakened for
whatever pertains to the Alma Mater,
a tender regard and affection for the
building, the grounds, and whatever
helps to adorn or beautify them.
That such a spirit is to be found in
the great majority of the students here
is undoubtedly true, but there are
among us not an inconsiderable num
ber of ruffians in whom such a senti
ment appears to be absent, and whose
greatest delight seems to be in defacing
and destroying college property when
ever an opportunity presents itself.
The result of their work is to be
seen almost any morning about Encina
Hall. During the night chairs and
cuspidors are hurled from the top to
the lower stories, being smashed into
a dozen fragments. Expensive elec
tric light bulbs are taken from the
lamps and cast from the windows out
onto the stone courts or from the cor
ridors into the halls beneath, breaking
into a thousand pieces with a loud re
port and covering the floor with glass.
Th is is not indeed a nightly occurrence
but it is by no means an infrequent
one.
Such actions are an insult to every
one having the interests of the college
at heart, and it is due only to a false
feeling of honor that these practices
have not been stopped by the students
themselves. We repeat that it is a
false impression of honor, for it cer
tainly can be no other than the duty of
•every student in Encina Hall to take |
it especially upon himself to report
the perpetrator of such offenses, so that |
•the University may be at once freed
from them and their vicious influence. I
