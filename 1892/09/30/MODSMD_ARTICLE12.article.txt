# THE
						BERKELEY RUSH.
## 
### 
As the days passed on and we heard
nothing of tlie much talked of class
rush at the State University, we hoped
that at last this barbarous custom had
found its death in the great wave of
progress which lias lately swept over
the college world, but in this we were
mistaken for the rush is now assured
and by the faculty of that institution
at that. Every University of any
standing in the United States has
taken up arms against this custom
and it has gone down condemned alike
i by faculty, students and the public.
They were indeed of some practical
utility at one time, when there was
: great need that the new members of
I the institutions become acquainted
with their own classmen and with
' those who would be their fellows for
years to come, but like many a better
custom it soon became subverted into
other channels and for other purposes
until all the good it may do cannot
be an excuse for one-tenth the mischief
that it causes. They are not now
simply class rushes, but are participa
ted in by every student of the Univer
sity, and are but a cover for the pay
ing off of old scores among the higher
classmen, who set an example of
cruelty and inhumanity which, sadly
enough, the new members are never
slow to follow, the result being that all
the joy is crushed out of many an un
fortunate lad who nurses broken limbs,
smashed noses, or sprains and injuries
from which he will never fully re
cover, and which in time may cause
serious trouble and even an untimely
death. Friendships so easily made
during one's first years among the
light-hearted mates are forever blight
ed by the hatred and antagonism en
gendered in these bouts. They are
but the relics of the old amphitheater;
the instinct is the same as that which
piled mangled frames mountain high
on the sands of the circus; and, it
may be added, their sanction is a
slight echo of the spirit of unsympa
thetic cruelty which from the Emper
or's throne waved the editor to pro
ceed to the slaughter.
