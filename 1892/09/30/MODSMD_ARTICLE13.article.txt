upon the editorial staff of The Daily
Palo Alto before the next issue.
The Editor-in-Chief having, with his
willing associates, worked hard and
earnestly for the success of the enter
prise, and having seen it at last firmly
estab.ished and receiving the support
of the entire institution has on account

the paper. The management will fall
upon the First Associate until the
Board of Directors have elected his
successor.
