# Freshmen Athletic Meeting.
## 
### 
A number of Freshmen, in response* j
to the call from some sub rosa com
mittee, convened in room 2of Encina
Hall Thursday evening, and perfected
an organization of the football team.
Mr. Cochran was unanimously elected j
captain, and the entire control of the j
team was placed in his hands. A bet
ter selection could not have been
made, as he has shown himself to be
a hard worker in practice, and one
who will undoubtedly strengthen the
team. It was decided to ask the class
fora per capita subscription with which
to furnish both football and baseball
teams with entire new suits, the former
jto consist of heavily padded pants,
sleeveless jackets, shoes, stockings,
j caps and sweaters ; the baseball nine
I to be provided with regular uniforms,
! minus the sweaters. The manager
j was empowered to arrange a game
I with the Berkeley Freshmen for
Thanksgiving Day, the game to be
be played in San Francisco or Oak
land. Monday, Wednesday, Friday
and Saturday evenings are to be de
voted to baseball practice until after
the Freshman-Sophomore game; and
Tuesday and Thursday to football
practice. The class expressed the
fullest confidence in their ability to
win hands down from the Sophomores
in either football or baseball, and
when a mild-eyed senior who hap
| pened to hold a joint owner-hip in
the room made a slight protest he was
[ he was unceremoniously bundled out
of the room.
