When the; University was formally
opened just ono year ago the depart
ment of geology was not represented at |
Palo Alto and no courses could be
afforded to prospective geologists.
With the second semester, however,
came Prof. Branner with a number
of advanced students who had been
working with him in the East and
j with the addition of numerous young
! aspirants work was begun in what has
i proved to be one of the most popular |
j departments in the Universitv. To j
I enter room 116 now one would hardly
i think that it had once been the resort
of scheming, speechmaking L. S. Jr.
I". Congressmen, nor is its present I
silent, scientific air any more compati
ble with the words of eloquence and
thunders of applause which wero once
contained within those four walls.
The department has been materially
j strengthened this year by the appoint-
I ment of Assistant Professor J. 1\
Smith. He is a graduate of Wofford
| College, S. C., receiving the degree of
A. B. in '84. The next two years
were spent at Vanderbilt University,
where lie was a fellow in geology, and
at the close of his course he was
awarded his master's degree. From
lH8(j to 1887 he was teacher of natu
ral science at the Nashville, Tenn.,
| High School, and from 1887 to 1890
i was on the staff of the Arkansas geo
i logical survey as assistant chemist and
I geologist. .
Prof. Smith then went abroad, and
i after studying for two years at < iottin
gen, Germany, received bis Ph. I).
1 degree this spring, and soon af.er ac
cepted the offer from the L. 8: Jr. U.
