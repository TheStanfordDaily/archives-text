# The 						First Patent.

### 
And now we hear from the L. 8.
J. U. from another source. Her name
is known and her influence felt
throughout the entire country, and
even the Patent Office is being invaded
hy her "Sons of Progress." Patter
son, 95, a student in the engineering
department, has filed a caveat for the
patent of his new musical instrument*
aptly named the " mandola." Its
characteristics were described in a for
mer issue, and thoy have so com
mended the instrument to many lead
ing musicians and dealers of San
Francisco that, by their advice, he in
tends to put it on the market. This
is the first but will probably not be
the last, a> the facilities of the depart
ment should be a great help to bright
young minds with the inventive genius
I so common to Americans,
