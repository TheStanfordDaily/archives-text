# Mr. Riddle's " Hamlet."

The entertainment of last evening
was of a high order, and the .size of
the audience that greeted the per

who are concerned in advancing and
elevaiing ilie standard of taste, and of
encouraging a greater amount of clas

skill that the ear is as easily led as

that of most of the actors who
are now starring the boards in
that role. Mis is not a
frenzied rampant madman, who stamps
the floor and rolls the eyes, hut a man
whose awful agony of heart is slowly
burning out his vitals, and who is sink*

bear, until at one bound, he seems to
leap from the depths to the heights of
despair, and closes the tragic evolution
of his character by the death of him
self and all who have opposed him.
1 he audience was a most apprecia

until he finished, well testified to his
merit,
