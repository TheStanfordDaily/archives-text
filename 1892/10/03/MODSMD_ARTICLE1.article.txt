V lien 111 g question ol' estdilisliing
ucl lily to he devoted to Stanford I Uni
versity interests w;is broached the first
objection hurled at us b_y the people
who are opposed to all new enterprises
was: "How can you print the paper?"
Every one recognized that, printing a
daily at lied wood or San Jose would he
almost impossible. A daily was wanted
and we could stand some inconvenience
fora time till the problem of punting
was solved.
No one c;in conceive the amount of
annoyance and inconvenience the staff
lias been subject to while the paper was
dependent upon the printers of the
Redwood City Democrat. It was seen
that the major part of the friciion was
due to the fact that wo were trying to
wrestle with a weighty load, holding it
at arm's length. Tho members of tin
stall and those interested io the welfare
of the Daily Palo Alto hint every
effort to remove the difficulty. The
result is more than any one cxpccted
From to-day we issue the Daily Pai.o
Alto from our own office, using our
own presses, type, and all comploto.
The success of getting a plant here
on the grounds is due principally to
the efforts of Mr Â»J. A. (Quelle, '!)">, who
hns accepted the p< sition <112 superin
tendent of the printing department-
Mr. Quelle is a union punter of sev
eral years experience in the ] liming
depirtment of S< rihn< Mui/n-.iiu , the
Sail Francho ('/troiii'dc. fin 1 other
hook and newspaper print) g establish
ments. His acquaintance with San
Francisco offices enabled him to find a
suitable outfit, which he brought here,
excepting the presses, which were unfit
fir our use. The material which w; s
sold to us c nsistcd of seventy five
fonts of type of all sizes, ranging from
agate to five line pica and including
many fonts of fancy job type. Besides
this there were all the necessary appur
tenancos to a newspaper and job ofiice
The press, which is the only lloe
power press between San Francisco
and San Jose, i.s a very handsome strue
turc It. is the fast cylinder press for
which the 11. lloe press manufacturers
of New York are so celebrated. The
rapacity is 2.000 copies per h mr.
Its cost laid down in Sin Francisco
was 51,500 It is connected by shaft
and belt with .the engines which run
the dynamos and machinery in the
wood shops, thus affording us reliable
ami steady power.
Until a suitable building can be
erected for us the plant will occupy the
vacant space in the southwest en<l of
he machine shops,

Hero we are provided with comfort
able mi 1 commodious quarters. The
Daily Palo A4-to by thus corning on
to the University grounds not only re
duces the work of the editors and man
agers to a minimum but also furnishes
work for five or six students who may
wish to spend part (if the day in work
in;' Mr. Qut ile has already employed
Neidig,of>, as pressman, and Hidden,
00, and Maxwell,'oo, as oinpositors.
Besides these he will be obliged to get
several printers fora few days until
student labor can be provided.
It is the intention now to have the
paper.- iff the press every evening at
five o'clock. Mr. John 13 Cleveland
Ins accepted the position of manager of
circulation and will provide for the
distribution of the paper as it comes
from the press This will enable the
subscribers to get their copies within
an hour after the issue. Mr. Cleve
land has also provided for newsboys to
deliver papers in Mayfield, l'alo Alto,
and College Tcrrace.
The read 'is and the*e interested in
the Daily I'alo Alto will see by
this tl at the staff is at work to make
a success If our elicits are appre
ciated let us hive continued that sup
purl which has already been given us.
