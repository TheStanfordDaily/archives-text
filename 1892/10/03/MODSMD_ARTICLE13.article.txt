Tlio Now Temple of Learning
Oponed Without Any Caremony.
r riic great University of Chicago
quietly set about its education d work
October Ist, without a formal opening
or ceremony of any kind Extreme
simplicity marked the llrst work of tho
institution, and llie occasion will be re
corded as unique in the history of col
leges. At 8:80 o'clock the f)00 students
met the diffcient jrd'essTs in their
class rooms, and the work (if the term
outlined. Studies weie assigned,
and the lectures began. The object of
I'residi nt Harper was to launch the
craft of learning as though it had boon
sailing upon the tide of education lor
tho InsPforty years, and nothing but
the newness of the surroundings indi
Gated that it was not. There was not a
hitch in carrying out the schedule of
exercises, which will be the routine of
work for years to come, though above it
all sounded the hammer and the saw if
the carpenters (n the new building al
- til') tirst, completed structure,
and the noise of tbs workmen and
horses on the grounds grading the land.
Two hundred or more visitors were
present, and all expected to hoar an
opening address, or at, least i-oine refer
ctice to the work, but they heard only
tho regular devotions. In tho minds of
the faculty the opejing was most lit
ting â€” I'lrnmincr.
