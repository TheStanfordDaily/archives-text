'1 he lobular cliaju 1 services were
conduct".<l by Kev. N. A. Haskell ol
Sui JÂ«se. His subject was,"The
Spirit ol'Truth Shall Load You into all
Truth." Ho showed how modern
thought was fust disclosing to all the
eiienes-; ol' ourselves and God. That
the workings of (bid aio about us ou
every hind and that not through mir
aculous manifostat ions should we look
lor 11 mi. Through all time this
sj irit ol'truth, uppermost, in the minds
of till great thinkers, hid played
hovoc with superstition and ignorance
At present this spirit of inquiry, never
restless, never Mopping as if all truth
had been discovered but ever patient
and tireless, was 112: st breaking down
the burners of creed and sect. When
the search after more truth shall have
stopped, then will progress end and
decay und destruction set in. Not iu
the letter and the law was the advance
ment of Mill'possible but rather in self
conviction and self r liancc. Ever
Ji-ten to the teachings of those inmost
convictions.
