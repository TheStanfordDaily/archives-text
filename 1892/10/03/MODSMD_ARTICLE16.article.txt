The Hopkins mansion at CJalii'orniu
.•! 11 <I Mason streets h yet owned by Mr
Sjarles ot' Methuen, M issachusetts, as
[ ait of Ihe property derived from the
wiJow uf Mark Hopkins. Ilisseveral
tinies-repeated desire to turn the house
overt) the people of S.in Francisco
ami Califomii lias ;n yet not been grat
ified, because of contingencies in the
way of taxes on the propeity, and the
expense incident to hs maintenance as
an in-titution for the general good.
The Art Association of San Francisco
is not able to accept the splendid gilt
for the reasons mentioned. No citiz 11
has yet seen lit to p'nee an endowment
to the credit ot the association sufficient
to keep up the Hopkins Searlcs College
of Arts, and unless the regents of the
University of California accept Mr.
Searh.s' offer, end mike the Hopkins
home part of the educiti mal system ol
the university, it seems likely tint the
offered gift will not be accepted. It is
the opinion of Regent Rodgers that the
State wo ild do well to acccpt the house
and turn it over to the university for
support. The internal arrangement of
the building peculiarly lits it for an art
school, he thinks, and under State con
t'ol it would be exempt l'roni tixatioa
i hat would 1»j buidensonie if carried by
I a private corporation. Regent Stcbbins
is wholly in sympathy with any plan
which may add to the breadth and uni
versality of the courses of study offered
by the State University. lie has not
lully matured his opinions about the
proposed llopkins-Searles College, bit
is n>t in any way an opponent of the
prop >sed acceptance ol the property by
the State. Regent Marvc, applying
business method-!, is confident that the
regents can safely a same the trust
suggeste 1, and by placing I ho Art Asso
ciation in immediate charge can effect
the purpose of Mr. Scarles, which is un
derstood t) lethe establishment of an
art center in San Kraneisco. —Ivrdra-
