# IN ENCINA'S GYMNASIUM.
## The
						Faculty Exercise. 
### 
Wednesday night for the first time
since the reception given to the new
students, Encina gymnasium was lighted
by electi icity. A reporter went around
to sec what was going on. li had been
announced that Monday and Thursday
evenings from eight till nine the gym
nasium would be open for the faculty
to exercise. And on Wednesday even
ing was a great number of that learned
body. Miid exercise was not the order
of the evening, either. An impromptu
but thoroughly energetic game of foot
ball was in full b'ast. Coats, vests,
and collars were discarded. Bucking
the center, running around the ends,
and tackling were the principal p'ays.
Furious and frantic tackles, which were
nothing but wrestling matches engaged
in by the whole crowd, always resulted
in crashing fal!s, at which loud applause
would go up from the assembled stud
ents. Each time as the tangled miss of
bodies, arms, and legs would emerge
from the struggling heap and assume
individual forms, a murmur of satisfac
tion would go up from the onlookers on
seeing that no one was hurt, and that
the fun would <zo on.
Protessor San fur el displayed great
ability as a center rush. Assistant
Greene showed an unusual ability to
endure violeut falls on the hard floor
without being hurt. Mr. Buchanan
distinguished himself by sacrificing a
white shirt in the fray. Gymnasium
Instructor Black hopes to have a faculty
eleven on the campus before long
