# Football Meeting

### 
At nine o'clock Wednesday evening
the loot ball placers and enthusi .sts met
in Encina gymnasium to discuss the
practicability o( niglit gymnasium work
for the foot ball squad. The idea of
this work is not to interline with regu
lar afternoon field practice, but to sup
plement it and put the men's muscles
in such a condition by systematic devel
opment, that hard falls on the field will
not injure them.
After a few introductory remarks by
('lemons in favor of gymnasium work,
Mr. lilaek gave his own experience to
co-ordinatft what had been urged in fa
vor of gymnasium practice in addition
to that done on the field lie said
that a man should keep in training all
the time whether he went on the field
or not, so that when he did go out he
would not feel any serious effects from
rough playing.
The necessity of another foot ball
field was spoken of. It was suggested
that since more men than can be accom
modated on two elevens olFer themselves
each day, a squad be formed to practice
trick and individual plays while the

oilier squad does regular game work,
these squads to alternate from day to
day. After a lively talk in which
many of those present had suggestions
to offer, Mr. Black gave the following
advice which it would be well for all
new players to heed: "Boys, if you go
out on the field to play foot ball, gopre
pared for it. Don't wear thin pants
and thin shirts. I myself believe in
lots of padding. An excellent thing is
a sponge in eatfi knee. They do not
look good, but they are of lots of ser
vice. Shin pads aie a great protection
to players, too. The backs should wear
elbow pads."
A list of those present who will an
swer to roll call for night work on Mon
day, Wednesday, and Friday from nine
until ten o'clock, in addition to regular
field work and whatever other gymnasi
um work they may do at other times,
was taken by Manager Champlain.
