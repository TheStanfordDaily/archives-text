# EDITORIALS.

### 
Tiie Inst two weeks have not been
exactly a season of joy to tie editors
and managers of tie Daily Palo
Alto. In fact there were certain
times when, despite our hopes and am
bitions, our days were full of woe
and we s;iw no pleasure in them. We
see in our lexicon that in Latin the
word editor means to cat Irons our
own experience v c found that editor
meant to go without eating, to cut
recitations, to take midnight trips to
Kedwood, and do other tilings which
would harrow up our feelings to re
late. However, there was written on
our shield the word, Hope. A noble
purpose was in our heart and we de
termined to fiuht it out on this line if
it took a college course.
With the first issue of our sheet we
lecame convinced that there was hut
i m way to maintain a respectable paper
and our pending in college at the
same time, and that way was to get a
plant <>n the grounds where we need
not, dissipate our energies. It was a
great problt m, but it is solved at last.
The Daily Palo Alto is to be a suc
cess at last.
Wc have always liked to contem
p'ate luxury from a distance and have
striven to gain a little more of this
world's goods, so that we might never
bo pinched with hunger, as we have so
frequently of late- r llie realization oi
those fond hopes never seemed possible
before. As the electric light goes out
slowly, like embers dying in the
and we light our small bit of candle,
there is asens3 of delicious serenity set
tles upon us and we enjoy in our mind's
eye some of the results ot our lard
earned success. Warming with tho
prospcct, our horizon widens and we
sit in :i handsomely cushioned chair
before a rich mahogany desk. James
has just brought in some Colorado Ma
duras and uncorked a quart of extra
dry. This is what we see in the fu
ture. '.I his is what beckons us on â€”
but tho thought of Tuesday's i.-sue
brings u- back to reality again.
