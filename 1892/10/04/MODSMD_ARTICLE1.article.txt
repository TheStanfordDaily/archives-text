Associate Professor Miller was born
at Wooster, Ohio, in 1801, and com
menced what was destined to be a most
successful literary career in the Heeds
burg, 0., district school, at the prom
ising age of four years, lie prepared
for college in the public schools of
Ann Arbor, Mich , and in 1877 entered
Parsons College where he spent two
years. At the age of sixteen he en
tcrcd the University of Michigan, grad
uating in '84 with the degree of M. A.
From 1 SS I- to 1885 he was a student at
Lcipsic, Germany, and from 1885 to
1880 was a member of the American
School of Classical Studies at Athens.
In 1880 Professor Miller returned to
America and accepted an instruetorship
in Greek at Ann Arbor. The follow
ing year he was transferred to the de
partment of Latin and Sanskrit as in
structor, and in isSS was advanced to
the rank of assistant professor in these
branches. In '89 Professor Miller
again went abroad and resumed his
studies at Leipzic, continuing there
until 1891. During the last year of
his stay there he was a senior in the
Royal Archaeological Seminary, and at,
the close of his course his abilities re

was made an honorary member of the
Royal Archaeological Society of Leip
zic. Again returning to America, he
was appointed Associate Professor of

Assciate Professorship of Latin at Stan
lord .
In literary work Professor Miller
has not been idle, and several articles
in the American Journal of Archaeol
ogy testify to his ability, lie has also
written the "Theatre of Thorikos," in
the papers of the American School of
Classical Studies at Alliens, and a
"Latin Prose Composition" based on
Ciceio and Livy, which has already
achieved a national reputation. This
latter work is used as a text book in
our Latin department. Judging by
Professor Miller's past record and the
reputation he bears among his students
for efliciency and thoroughness, we feel
that the L. S. J. IJ, is to be congratu
lated ou securing so able and well
known an educator.
