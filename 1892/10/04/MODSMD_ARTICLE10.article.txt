SoiriE sort of an understanding
should be inado when moctiiigs of dif
ferent class and student organizations
are to bo hold, To-day four meetings
were called for practically the same
time in different rooms of the quad
rangle. The Freshmen posted a notice
fora class meeting at 1:80, the Sopho
mores fora meeting at 1:15, the Co
operative Association fora meeting of
all its share holders at 1:30. and the
Associated Studonts fora meeting of
all students at 1:30 to nominate officers
for the ensuing year. Now, it it evi
dent to all that such carelessness in
calling meetings should be avoidod. A
meeting of the Associated Students
concerns the whole student body, and
should properly have preference over
all other meetings. But meetings
could be arranged so that they would
not conflict if notice were given of them
far enough in advance, and those no
tices published in the daily. Where
(?o many students come from a distance
every day and arrive here just in time
to enter ,i recitation, it is impracticable
to post a notice of any student meeting
later than a day before it is to be held,
as most of the students do not find time
to consult the boards several times each
day to hoc if new noticcs have been
posted.

Now that wo have plenty of water
again, why not ilood the foot ball field?
This field iti its present condition is
ically dangerous to play on. The thin
coating of sand that has been put on the
surface amounts to nothing as far as
preventing bruises or scratches or even
more serious injuries. In many places
the adobe soil is baked so hard that
there is little difference between it and
the hard packed roads. Last spring
the proper thing to have done—was to
have had the field plowed and plenty
of clay and sand thoroughly mixed into
the soil, then there would have been
grounds soft and lit to play on—some
thing similar to the base ball diamond.
lJut since nothing was undertaken to
prevent the present state of affairs, the
next best thing should be done and
that is to irrigate it. In the Quadran
gle arc two hose carts with plenty of
hose to extond from the hydrant at the
south-east corner of the dormitory tu
the field. This hose was used only
yesterday to wet down the dust about
the Quadrangle. Surely it is high
time the proper authorities were tak
ing the matter under consideration and
acting. Perhaps, when wc have
grounds suitable to play on, without
the men sustaining injurios, more play
ers and more enthusiasm will center on
the football field.
