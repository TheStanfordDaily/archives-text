C. M. Barker, who has been engineer
at the Uuiversity for six years was
nominated last week for county sur
veyor of Santa Clara county bv the
democrats. Mr Barker is a gentle
man, and has always been courteous
and accommodating to the students of
the University. If ho should be suc
cessful in obtaining this new position,
he doubtless will carry with him a
warm remembrance of this institutions
Every voter in the Uuiversity should
give him his vote regardless of party
lines.
