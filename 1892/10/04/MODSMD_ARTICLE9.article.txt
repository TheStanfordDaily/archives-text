The meeting at the University Club,
in San Francisoo last Saturday, resulted
as was expected in the situation re
maining exactly the same. Stanford
finds it impossible to put a team worthy
of the University, in the field before
the Christmas vacation. It is not with
us a matter of sentiment, it is the plain
hard fact, that if we play before Jan
uary, we court defeat. Everyone
knows the condition of our grounds and
the men from whom we must pick a
team. We have scarcely a man in the
University who is at present thoroughly
qualified for a center position. The
agreement last year was for one game
to be played March 19th. A year
from that date the University of Cal
ifornia men can rightfully demand a
second game. But previous to that
time they have no right to ask us for a
game in which we would be handi
capped by circumstances.
