Tiie meeting at the University Club,
iu San Francisoo last Saturday, resulted
as was expected in the situation re
maining exactly the same. Stanford
iinds it impossible to put a team worthy
of the University, in the field before
the Christmas vacation. It is not with
us a matter of sentiment, it is the plain
hard fact, that if we play before Jan
uary, we court defeat. Everyone
knows the condition of our grounds and
the; men from whom we must pick a
team. We have scarcely a man in the
University who is atproson thoroughly
qualified fora center position. Tho
agreement last year was for one game
to be played March 19th. A year
from that date the University of Cal
ifornia men can rightfully demand a
second game. But previous to that
time they have no right to ask us fora
game in which we would be handi
capped by circumstances.
