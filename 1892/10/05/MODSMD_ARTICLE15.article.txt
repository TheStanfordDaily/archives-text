Mr. Moulton, without doubt, rank,-
higher as an extension lecturer thin
any other man in tlie world.
The university starts with the
princely poscssion of about 6f>,000,000,
in money, land, and buildings.
The city of Chicago is the epitome
oi what lias been gained west of the
original thirteen states. All roads do
load here, as to Jfonio of old.
It. is safe to say that no other institu
tion has had such a christening. The
people of the world are to bo here next
year—the iirst year of the new univer
sity.
J>r. Ilarper (the president) is but
thirty-six years old. What may not be
prophesied of a new institution with an
endowment of this one, headed by a
young man of the ability, energy, and
popularity poscssed by William liainey
Harper!'
It is safe to say that, no other insti.
tution ever opened with,such a laboratory
near at hand—for the university
grounds adjoin those of the World's
Fair. What studies "in sociology
there will be in the surging crowds
which will press through Chicago in the
year oi 1803! What a trip around the
world can a University of Chicago stu
dent take within a radius of two miles
of the university! Was there ever such
an opportunity for American young
men and women.
Wo may now chronicle the last im
portant, step of learning. The culture
ol (irecce passed on to Rome, and
gained by mixture with a political sys
tem. Thcnce the united stream lied
north to Oxford and Cambridge. Cens
ing awhile, it next crossed the Atlantic,
and settled in Harvard and \ T ale. After
two hundred years it makes its latest
advance to the center of a land on
whose margin it lingered so long. In
spanning this last thoousand miles of
its progress it has compassed a country
only lately won for the mind's life, and
just beyond lies a land whore as yet the
many arc working with their hands.
Acknowledgments arc due to I'rof.

Oliver Twist appetite lor "more proof."
