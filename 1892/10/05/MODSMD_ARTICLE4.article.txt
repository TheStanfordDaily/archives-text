# Our Water Supply.
## 
### 
As very few know, our water supply
is obtained from Scarsvillo Lake, which
is situated about four or live miles from
the University, in a southwesterly di
rection .
Tho lake and property around be
longed to Senator Stanford, and after
an arrangement with the Spring Valley
Water Company, they took possession
under certain conditions. The most
important of these conditions was that
the U diversity should have a certain
amount of the water, tho Spring Valley
Water Company taking all over this.
The lake on one side had rolling land,
and on the other a steep bluff Where
the gorge is narrow ai,d rocky on its
sides, was the place chosen for the dam
In summer there has always been a
small stream flowing through this
basin, but in winter it becomes a rush
ing torrent,; and from this great flow of
water we are to obtain our supply.
The dam, which is a beautiful piece
of engineering work, was built by Mr.
Shattuck of San Francisco. It. is bow
shaped and built of artificial granite
blocks. It is now forty feet high, and
all the water within the dam belongs to
the University. It is intended to add
on, in the near future, sixty feet more,
theroby making a dam one hundred feet
in height. The length of the dam is
probably three or four hundred feet,
and at the base about forty or fifty feet
thick.
The lake is stocked with fish, and for
a mile or so runs back anion" the hills.
