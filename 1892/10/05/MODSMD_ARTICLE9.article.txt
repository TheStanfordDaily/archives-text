# Campaign Uniforms.
## 
### 
That the political parties ol' the
country think the Stanford University
vote is not to be despised is evident
from the many attentions which they
are bestowing upon us. Jielow is a let
ter to Mr. Truinbo from the national
headquarters of the republican commit
tee, which explains itself:
Headquarters of Republican Nation d
Committee, 518 Fifth Ave., N. Y.
Mr. Howard Trumbo,
Stanford University.
My Dear Brother Howard:â€”l have
shipped to you to-day fifty campaign
uniforms in white for your University
Republican Club. You can have select
ed out of the organization a marching
club ol fifty members, and uniform
them. Please present these uniforms
to the club with my compliments.
Yours as ever,
Isaac Trumho.
The club will probably distribute the
uniforms which Mr. Trumbo's brother
has given them, and take part in some
of the parades in San .lose and Han
Francisco. Au extended knowledge of
military tactics is not required for such
a parade. A couple of hours drilling
vill be sufficient to acquaint a company
with a sufficient number of marchiug
movements to enable them to preseut a
good appearance in line. A few cardi
nal transparencies, and the Stanford
yell given as only our boys kuow how
to give it, wonld attract considerable
attention, it is to be hoped the scheme
will be pushed by the republican club.
