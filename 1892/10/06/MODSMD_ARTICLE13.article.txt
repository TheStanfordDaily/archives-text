The Stanford students earned for
themselves last year a reputation ol
which they may feel justly proud. At
the football games in San Francisco ii
was a common remark that although tin-
Stanford hoys were full of enthusiasm
for their University, they were gener
ally well behaved, and those features ol
rowdyism which mar assemblies of even
the most gentlemanly students, wen
wanting. When football or baseball
teams were invited here, the courtesy
which was shown them has called forth
complimentary remarks from their mem
bers. The University has lost nothing
ty this. AVe have gained the good will
of such valuable friends as the Olympic
Athletic Club of San Francisco. The
value of such friends was apparent in
many of our contests, such as that with
the University of California. Few men
outside of football teams know how
much of our victory was due to the as
sistance of the Olympic Club.
it is very probable that the freshman
football and baseball teams will visit
the various high schools and fitting
schools of the vicinity during this year
to play games. The actions of the men
who accompany the teams on these
trips will do more to enlist the sym
pathies of those students intending to
enter some university next year than
anything else. The genuine loyalty ol
the Stanford men will be apparent by
their actions on such trips.
From time to time prominent people
are invited to appear before the stud
ents. The impression that such people
receive is frequently the criterion by
which they judge the University and
its work. They naturally expect to sec
an audience which is refined and cult
ured as a whole. A good deal of res
ponsibility rests upon the student body.
How to receive and applaud a perform
er is an art, though frequently "more
honored in the breach than the observ
ance."
