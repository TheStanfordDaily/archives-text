# Dr. White's Account of Stanford.
## 
### 
Dr. Andrew D. White, who wa
with us for some time last year giv
ing a course in tho history of the
French ilovolulion recently wrote
quitÂ© a glowing account of Stanford
University for the New York Chris
tian AtJvacdlr, The account describes
very graphically tho surroundings of
the University and tho support
which it lias from tho people of the
West. After describing tho Palo
Alto estate he says:"In the midst
of this great estate havo been placed
t he first buildings, and they aro well
worthy tho attention of men inter
ested in university architecture, not
only in this country, but in others.
Certainly no more beautiful plan has
ever been adopted by any institu
tion, and none has over been carried
out so far as it has gone with greater
fidelity Knowing, as 1 do, almost
every institution of importance in
our country, I do not hesitate to say
that the section of tho plan already
carried out is far finer than anything
which has been achieved in any other
part of the United States. Tho great
interior quadrangle or court of the
University must always rank among
the nobler specimens of architecture
in tho world."
As to the faculty, President Jor
dan is developing more and more
the qualities that led to his election,
tho same which were recognized
when ho was a student at Cornell,
an investigator at tho Smithsonian
Institution, and president of Indiana
University. lie has already gathered
about him a faculty of vigorous men.
II is plan is evidently to choose
young men who havo a reputation to
make and can make it. Many of us
in eastern collegos know to our cost
how keen is his eye in selecting and
attracting just those whom our in
stitutions would gladly retain. 1
havo boon struck with the intellec
tual vigor and earnestness of those
young professors as I havo discussed
university matters with them, or
seen them at work with their classes,
and am prepared to see this faculty
become, not only one of the largest,,
but one of the most intlucntial in
the United States. The students, too,
havo greatly intluenced mo. I re
member that tho question was asked
when Governor Stanford's proposal
was first made, "Whero is such an
institution to get students?" That
question is answered Over live
hundred are now in attendance, and
ihe cry is, "Still they come."
