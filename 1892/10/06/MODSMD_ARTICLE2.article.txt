Porhaps a fow words concerning
j the religious standing of our stu
i donts may lie of interest to every
I rnombor of the Univossity. As a
result of the statistics taken by the
Christian Apsooiation, we rind thai
we have members of churches repre
senting 19 different denominations.
Of 1 lieso the Presbyterians aro repro
sonted by 10!) students, 80 of whom
are members of ihe church; Meth-
I by 80, with - r >() members; Epis
| eopalians 71, with 10 mombers;
Congrtgationalisls (JO, with 37 raom
bors; Unitarians :>4, with 10 inem
bors; P>aptists 20, with 14 members;
Catholics 1(>, with 14 members.
Various other denominations aro rep
resented with the membership of
each varying from 1 to 7. Those
statistics were taken from the cards
of 551 students. Examining thofo
more corefully, we find wo have 20(5
students who are members of
churches, or in other words, about
fifty per cent. This is about, the
same percentage of church members
we had the second semester of last
year. There are 107, or about
thirty per cent., who are not mem
bers, but who have church prefer
ences; 118 have no church prefer
ences, that is about twenty per cont.
A committee will soon be appointed
to fco those who have registered
since these statistics were taken, and
complete our record. It is gratify
ing to note that about eighty per
cent, of our student body aro mem
bers of, or prefer, some particular
church.
