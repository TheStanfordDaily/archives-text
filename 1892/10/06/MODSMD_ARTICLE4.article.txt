# The 						Occident Compliments the Palo Alto.
## 
### 
We were most agrceeably surpiiscd
to find on our table the Daily Palo
Alto. Not a little courage is required
to start a daily in a university with the
members of Stanford Harvard, Vale,
Michigan, Brown, Princeton, amd Cor
nell has each its daily —but these are
small cities in thomsolves. Hence we
say it takes not a little courage for
Stanford to start a daily, 'i he Daily
Palo Alto is issued by the whole
student body through its representatives
the editors. This is a feature of
strength which promises much. In its
editorial the Palo Alto says:"A« yet
there is no demand fora daily, but
there is a lield for it. When ail the
students lived in Encina and lloble
Halls, tile bulletin boar.ls served the
purpose of publishing important no
tices. This year lefts than one-third
the students liv-c in the University
grounds. The Daily will he to stud
ents thus scattered what the newspaper
is to the business man."
'flic Palo Alto contains a column
devoted to Berkeley items, showing
thus a pleasing courtesy and interest to
the .sister institution.
While undoubtedly it i. an effort
that is fraught with great difficulty, the
spirit that starts it, and the solid
support of professors and .indents in a
body, give excellent promise of its suc
cess. We heartily commend the eflort,
and welcome the lirst collegiate daily
published on the Pacilic Coa.-i
