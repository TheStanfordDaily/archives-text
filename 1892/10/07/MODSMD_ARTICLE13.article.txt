Aspirants lor the football team must
—simply must —learn the philosophy
of low tackling. A half-back can not
be tackled once out of ten times above
the waist —if he can, he is not a good
runner. It is true that occasionally in
a center rush it seems impossible to get
down low, but it can be done and th°
closer a man is to the ground the more
force lie can bring to bear in the di
rection of the enemy's goal. A high
tackle sometimes catches the grand
stand, but a scientilic critic of the game
at once sets the player down as a nov
ice who gets his man above the waist.
