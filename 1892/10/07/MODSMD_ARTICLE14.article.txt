Bearing against the wood pimps is
the half finiflied form of what was
intended lor a tackling bag, but one
look, or rather one lilt, gives the person
unitiated to the mysteries of football*
the impression that this weighty and
solid looking affair was fashioned fora
pile-driver. One swing of such a pond
mass of material as this is made of
would knock a man senseless. What is
needed, is a canvas bag, stiffened with
some soft material, and liung from a
secure fastening. The hope of getting
a tackling bag tliis year, like the hopes
of a grand-stand, club-bouse, and turf
football field, all, it seems, must fade
away like a cherished dream.
