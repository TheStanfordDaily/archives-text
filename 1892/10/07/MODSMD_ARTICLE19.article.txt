# Ann Arbor Notes.

### 
A talk with Secretary Wade, makes
one certain that the University ol
Michigan will have three thousand sin
dents this year. Many thought that
the new Chicago University would
materially lessen our numbers,but judg
ing from the number who have so far
applied for admission in all depart
ments, wo shall again outnumber Har
vard, though she is expecting three
thousand. To the old student return
*ng this year not many changes in the
campus will appear. The new law
building is complete and ready lor u-e,
and adds much to the appearanco of that
part of the campus. The gym pre
sents a ghastly and forlorn appearance;
the newengineering laboratory is finished
and equipped, the hospitals have had
had their finishing touches, and the
dome of the main building has been
painted.
Further than this there are no par
ticular changes in buildings. The new
student and the old student as well will
be pleased to see the splendid outlook
fora stronger football team than we
have ever had Captain Dygert has
had two elevens on the athletic field for
several days at hard practice and close
teamwork. A number of new men
are practicing and the old men of last
year's team are about all hack. Man
ager Griffin has b?en very successful in
securing Mr. Frank Barbour, of Vale
fame, to coach the boys this year. Mr
Barbour has a thorough knowledge ol
the game, and through his aid the boys
are developing rapidly and well. lie
will be with the team until after they
play with the Cornell team on Thanks
giving Day.
Many a student, coming back here
this fall casts hopeful glances toward
the corner of the campus, where he ex
pected to see a competent "gym " But
instead ol this he sees only the large
walls erected. The work has been
much delayed owing to the fact
that the contractor could not obtain the
iron because ol the strike at Homestead.
As soon as the iron is obtained the
building will be roofed. Farther than
this the work cannot be carried, owing
to lack of funds. It will take $20,0!'0
to finish the present building, while
the contemplated co-ed annex will cos'
$50,009 more. It is to be hoped
that the additional money may bo
raised so that tho "gym" will soon be
completed and in use.
