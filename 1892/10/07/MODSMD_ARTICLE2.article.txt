A now feature of the next State
Fair and one of absorbing interest
to a class that cannot bo attracted
by tlio usual methods might be ar
ranged by a contest between our two
gio.it universities, which aro so even
ly matched, ami aro the prido of the
State. After a conference between
directors of tho fair and management
of the universities, lot n series oi
contests bo arranged r.n as exten
sive a scale as seemed depirable.
Suppose that the athletic contests
should include football, baseball,
tug-of-war between tea ms from each

class, long distance races, hurdle
races,tennis, etc,
Lot oratorical, liiorary, and elocu
tionary contests be arranged between
classes. Let competitive displays be
made ol' domical work, geological,
entomological, and botanical classi
fication and all along the lines ol
scientific work that would suggest
themselves to heads of departments.
I.et an orator be chosen by the ad
ministration ol' each university to
represent its case, and show why it
should be awarded the grand prize
for display of system of instruction
best calculated to promote ihe in
terests of California. Lot the judges
bo composed of educators from |
.abroad most distinguished in exeeu-!
tivc departments of great universi
ties, and each give the grounds of
his decision in a carefully prepared
argument, rich in suggestions for
improvement along the line of high
er culture.
The report of such a contest should
be very suggestive to the manage
ment of similar institutions and be j
valued among educators the world j
over, thus advertising those attract i
ion iof California i:i which we have
reason to take most, pride.
Those who saw San Francisco
turned up-side down by the football
game last winter can imagine the
excitement of a general contest last
ing a week or more. Everybody in
the Statu would take sides. They
would come back from the World's)
Euir to see it. Every little boy and
girl would wear the colors of bis
favorite university. Our electric!
cars would bo turned into coaches.
The whole world would know of the i
leading features of the contest and
an ambition to acquire a thorough
education would be born injthon
sauds of minds.
The various rooms im the State
Capitol and the great Pavillion would
be available for lit,< rnry and orator
ical contests aud the Park for ath
letic games. Hero is a chance to
turn the fair in the direction of
ideas and awaken the most exciting
competition possible and of so var
ied a nature as to suit all tastes.
It shold draw out tens of thousands
who never attended a Sta'oFair.
