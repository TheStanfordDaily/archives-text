This new journal (the Daily
Palo Alto) comes to our table
looking as fresh, crisp, and business
like as possible. It is published
by the students oi th' Jjeland Stan
ford Jr. University and is devoted
to University matters. We note
with pleasure that, while evidently
dominated by that esprit de corps
which is absolutely necessary in the
organ of so great a University, the
Palo Alto handles without gloves
any shortcomings or absolute wrong
doing it may note among the students.
In one number La most sensible art
icle condoming the now Inppily de
caying "class-rush,"and another edi
torial scoring in unmeasured but gen-
tlemanly terms the action of certain
ruffianly students in destroying fur
niture at Encina Hall. Such daily
comment from such a source will
tend largely to throttle at birth the
faults sure to creep in among so
large a body of students, and to keep
the standard of gentlemanly and
womanly behavior high.
The Palo Alto comes out strongly
for social culture in connection with
University life and is full of live news
from quadrangle, lecture room, and
exercise grounds.
