This new journal (the Daily
Palo AIjTo) comes to our table
looking as fresh, crisp, and business
like as possible. It is published
by the students oi th' Jjeland Stan
ford dr. University and is devoted
to I'niversity matters. We note
with pleasure that, while evidently
dominated by that esprit <!< corps
which is absolutely necessary in the
organ of fo great a Uuivejsity, the
Pai.o Alto handles without gloves
any shorl*tÂ»Qh lings or absolute wrong
doing' ii may note among the students.
In one number La most sensible art
icle condoming the now Inppily de
caying "class-rush,"and another edi
torial scoring in unmeasurd but gen
tlcnianly terms the action of certain
ruffianly students in destroying fur
niture at. Enein.i lbd'l. Such daily
comment from such a source wiil
tend largely to throttle at birth the
faults sure to creep in among so
large a body of students, and to keep
tho B'andard of and
womanly behavior high.
The Pai.o Ai.to conies out strongly
for social culture in connection with
Univc r. ity life and is full of live news
tiom quadrangle, locluro room, and
exercise {'rounds.
