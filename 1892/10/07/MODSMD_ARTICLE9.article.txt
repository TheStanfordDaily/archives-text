Team: Dear Sir â€”D.) you want a
drawing card lor an Xmas or New
Years game? Wo claim the cham
pionship of tbn universities of the
West,, except none, and 1 would like
vory much to meet you during the
X.ma-> holidays, at either Denver or
Sin Francisco. This game, properly
advertised, would, 1 believo, do more
for football than anything, and for
that reason, and to demonstrate the
suporioiity of our men, if possi
ble, 1 would like to arrango a game,
Murray Campbell, your tennis man,
claims that your climate is best for
athleh s, on account of the uniform
ity of thetunpeiaturo, but I would
not judge that to bo an advantage,
af4 it gives tho men no time for rest
An immediate answer.
\ ours truly, "

Manager.
