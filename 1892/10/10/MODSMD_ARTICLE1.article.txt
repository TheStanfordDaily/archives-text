It linn conio and gone, and once more
the class ol' '9*i has added :i link to her
long chain ol' victories. The day was
not i peril et one from a baseball stand,
point at least. There was a strong
wind blowing which made it very disa
greeable, blowing great clouds of dust
into (he laces of both spectators and
pi lycrs.
The diamond was in fair condition
when compared to its previous state.

the more energetic ones who, on the
previous da}', by the kind permission of

a horse and a harrow and gave to the
diamond the first proper care it has yet.

lowed with a similar treatment, at least,
once a week, we shall have at Palo Alto
an inliehl second to none in the state
The game was marked in its woeful
want of hard hitting. jhith pitchers
did effective work, White having a tri
ll; the better of it, allowing but three
hits off his delivery, and giving but two
men the initial on balls. The great dif
lVruice in the score is due chiefly to

Laine, while on the other hind the
sophomores gave White, with the ex
ception of a few instances, the best of
support.
Notwithstanding the unevenncss

lent a lively interest to the game
throughout. Neither side scored in the
second. In the third, on two errors
and a hit, the freshmen scored two runs,
but failed to send a man across the
plate after that; the sophomores made
one it: the third. In the fourth the
freshman were taken with a case ol
rattles, and not until their opponents
hail passed five men over the rubber
did they recover. The fifth was barren
of results. The sixth added one more
to t he bulging score of the sophomores
The eighth ended the run getting, with
two more for the sophomores, who suc
ceeded in preventing their rivals from
again crossing the magic square, and
so ended the deciding game of the
league with the "pioneer" class as chain
