Alter th Freshman-Sophomore base
ball game Saturday a very interesting
game ol football look place The play
ing was rather rough and unscientific:.
I'he vnrst feature of the practice was ;
the high tackling. > nti 1 the men un j
dcrstand how highly importaut low j
tackling is, no high degree of skill will j
be shown. \\ hen u man mak.s a tack
Ic above the waist or a foul he should
be severely criticised. It i. queer how;
some men will play night after night!
without, seemingly making any improve I
ment, in this Not until the men <fo
learn the gospel of low tackling will|
thoy bo playing real football Of late j
the proper thing seems to be to do all!
Ihe foul playing and olf side work pos- j
sib!c. \\ hen the men net into a game
with a (dose umpire they wili see the;
error under which they labored Wal- i
ton and Kennedy are doing good work.
As soon as Walton gels the requisite!
experience he is going- to forge lo the !
front as an excellent back. He his the I
energy, dash, and aggressive spirit nee-j
cssary for such a position Kennedy j
has had experience and makes s uie!
great runs, but ho wants to do mote
warding off with hi; aim Cochran'
docs too much foul playing IP. < tack- '
ling, however, is the liuc.it on the li -id.
Briggs is putting up the same kind of
game as last ycai--not brillltanfc but
sure. Downing goes too faa back of i
the lino when ho runs with the ball. |
His interfering is great White house j
has the making of a good center in him.
Stuart makes some brilliant runs but j
has hardly enough ol the aggressive;
spirit. Code is doing the came line j
work at quarter an of old. lie still re-\
tains his old limit of high tackling.
