# Friday Night's Concert.
## 
### 
'i !)â€¢.' concert given on last Friday
evcuing at the chapel was greeted by a
lull house and was therefore a financial
; uccess, netting about 6125 to the loot
ball team.
If continued appim-o is indicative of
the meritoriousm s j of a rjumber, cer
tainly nothing would admit, of criticism,
i>lit we consider that this feature of tl e
evening was carried to an extreme }'y
somo of the audience. Considering the
short time it, has had for study, the
male quartet did good work and de
served the applause it. received. Shir*
ley lVik-er shows a great deal of skill
and taste i:i handling his voice. The
position of accompanist is one of the
mo. t. difficult there is to liil and till
well, but one would have to look for
some time before linding a man whose
natural talent, and musical ability bet
ter lit him for such a position than does
that of Mr Austin Ivautz. Thanks arc
due to all those who so kindly assisted
in miking the football benefit a suc
cess.
