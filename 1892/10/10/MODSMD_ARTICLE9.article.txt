A couple of weeks ago at a meet
ing of tho class of '90 in the quad
rangle there was a great effort on
tho part of a number of upper class
men to show their veneration for
certain college customs which have
been in vogue in many colleges and
universities in this country. It
seoms too bad that the efforts wore
iu vain. For two nights and as
many days, first and second year
students walked around with chips
on their shoulders which, if they
were knocked off were carefully re
placed and too wearer proudly in
vited others to repeat tho operation
It ought to liavo boon rare fun but
something was lacking. Surely it
was not class spirit for tho earnest
endeavors to do something plainly
showed that spirit was not lacking,
whatever was.
A crowd of second year students
stood in front of tho chapel sur
rounded by spectators who looked
at the flushed checks of those who
were waiting fora chance to explode
tho energy which had b.en accumu
lating in them during the last year.
Suddenly one filled his lungs and
gavo vent to a yell that echoed
down tho quadrangle. "Ninety
live!" ho fairly roared. His clnss_
mates looked at him nervously. The
spectators directed their gaze upon
him and he felt he was the cynosure
of all eyes. He blushed, slunk down
into the crowd and felt like the boy
who laughs out loud in church.
Just thou a man called to Paulson
and started on a run to catch tho
bus for the next train. Like a mad
dened herd, tho second year students
gavo chaso but it availed them noth
ing. There wasn't oven a head bro
ken. Tho next day tho affair on tho
tank took place and eamo very near
ly being a success. Still somothing
was laeking. If tho members of tho
two lower elasses had been philoso
phers as some of thom may possibly
bo some day, thoy would have sat
down and solved tho question, ap
pointed a joint committee to furnish
the lacking commodity, and when
the committee roportod they would
havo met and have had a genuine
old time rush resulting in a goodly

number of broken heads together
with eyes gougod out and other
things which make college life en
durable. Jiowever, they did not act
philosoplro.tlly, and now tint thinys
are running along smoothly we re
grot to say that it looks as if our
chances fora rush aro slim. It is a
â€¢hame! In those dogonerato days
wo lose the fire which animated
ihe breasts of our ancestors. Why
can't we have a good, old-lime rush?
Why can't we build a fence like that,
so renowned in Yale's song.sand
stories? How is it that our rival,
Berkeley, is so far ahead of us in this
respect? The attempt to solve this
problem will bo taken up in to mor
rows editorial.
