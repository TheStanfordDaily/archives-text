In yesterday's editorial there were
so mo remaiks concerning a reec-nt
attempt nt a rush between the iirsl
and second year students, together
with a promise to oiler some suggest
ions upon the subject of rushes in
to day's papar.
The rush is an old custom, not
exactly a time honored one fortius
implies that it has met with approv
al. It possibly is tho remnant of
that system wlreli employed lags
Whatever is its origin, it recognizes
a class distinction and rights which
one class has and tho other lias no!.
Sometime in the history of colleges
iu this country it became a theory
that only soplnnorcs should be alow
ed to carry canes. If a freshman
appeared with a walking stick tin
sophomoae felt it his duty to maintain
the dignity of his class by taking
the cane away. If the entire fresh
man class backed tho defiant ivane
bearcr and the sophmore class as a
body attcmp ed to take it awav, a
general s-juffl j took place, and this
is what is known as a el iss rush.
Tho custom was at best a sons- 1
less one. If the cmo had been a
symbol of anything in paitienlar bo
sides the mere assertion that oiu
class had the rights which were not
enjoyed in common with the other,
then there would have been a <• rtain
veneration about it which would
lnve entitled the custom to 1 i\ o .
The cane lush as it stands now is
almost an extinct custom. The most
prominent colleges and universities
of tho United States have allowed it
to follow in the train of hazing and
only a very few keep up the custom,
and those that do keep it up are
only such as are last, to tako up with
new ideas and of course last to drop
old ones,
One reason why tho rush in Stan
ford is forced and unnatural is be
cause there is no custom to sanction
it. And as long as the custom is j
not established why exert special ef
fort to establish it now V It has i
give out in universities of the first
rank and if we consistently asserti
