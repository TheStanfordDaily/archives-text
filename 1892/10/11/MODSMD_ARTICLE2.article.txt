# Some Football Notes.
## 
### 
That football is becoming more
popular throughout this country is
evident from the demand for coaches
In Harper'* llnldy of Oct. Ist Cas
par Whitney requests all those who
deem themselves fitted for such a
position to send their names to him,
as a great number of requests of this
character have been sent to him from
all parts of the country.
Spalding and Pros. have publish
ed along with this year's football
rules an introductory chapter by
Walter Camp. There are also a
number of cuts that lend interest.
The eastern college football train
ing is under full sway. At present
Harvard seems to have the advantage
as many of the old players are back
and besides they are more evenly
distributed for the positions. Traf
ord, Corbett, and Like are back.
Yale is particularly unfortunate in
having almost all her moti as candi
dales for positions behind the line.
With Balliet of last year's Lehigh
team Princeton has tho strongest
center rush in the country. Riggs
and Wheeler will play guards, so
look for brilliant work from Piince
ton's center.
Ann Arbor has Frank Barbour, at
one time ono of Yale's great quar
ters, to coach their team this year.
With the opening of tho Chicago
University and Htagg at tho head of
physical training at litis university
athletics at the University of Michi
gan will enter on a new era of ad
vancement.
