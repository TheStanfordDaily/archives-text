# Football Practice.

### 
Practice yesterday was still care
less. Tackling was not as low as it
should l>o and there was very little
interference The hall was mulled
a good deal. Several times backs
made runs when they should have

been downed behind the line. The
J ball should bo put in playimmedi
! ately, no matter whether the signals
j are known to the other side or not.
The winning of the piacticegame
is not important but quickness of
play is very important. Those long
! conferences between the quarters
j and the backs only hinder tho pro
! gross of the gamo,
