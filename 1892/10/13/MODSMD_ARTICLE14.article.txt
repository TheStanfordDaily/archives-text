Tiikue ia a committee from tlie
third year students which is discuss
ing tho mutter of an annual to be
issued at the close of tho college
year. This is a matter in which we
are all interested, for though tho an
nual is a class production, to the
world it represents the University.
The production of such a volume
entails upon its editors and man
agers a great deal of work. If it is
a success it will redound lo their
credit, but if i! is a failure the odium
will fall upon the University as a
whole.
In this in other things let u
endeavor to act in accordance with
the most recent ideas. Tho college
annual of a few years ago contained,
beside a few items of interest con
nected with the college, several
literary features, but the bulk of the
book consktid of jokes, cracks,
grinds, and things to excite mirth
Many of were good and ex
ceedingly funny, but there wasp,
certain high-school-joko air about
many which did but little credit to
thn college. The recent annuals of
tho best colleges and universities
are throwing out the literary and
joke elements and confining them
selves to the production of a volume
which shall be but little moro than
an elaborate register.
A Stanford annual of this descript
ion would be of great value and
prized highly by students of this and
other universities. As yet there is
no first class souvenir of the Univer
sity which is worthy of tho name.
Such a volumo as is here suggested
could contain, besides the list of
students and such matter as is pub
lislicd in the I'niversity Register for
1801-112, several good cuts of build
ings, grounds, and surroundings.
This would mako it attractive as a
souvenir. It could contain cuts rep
resenting the different teams, classes,
fraternities, and social organizations,
making it of great interest to our
own and other students. Thoro is
