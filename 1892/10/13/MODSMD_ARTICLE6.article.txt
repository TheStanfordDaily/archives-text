# Rush at Columbia
## 
### 
Columbia College opened its doois
Monday, and, according to custom,
President l.ow admonished the
"Sophs" and the "Fresh" to refrain
from their customary rushing.
President Low told that Yale and
Cornell, and he might have added
Michigan, had abandoned the rough
custom.
Ntowithstanding the request of
the president, the rival classes met
and ff rush ensued which resulted in
many bruises and torn clothes. Al
tera short struggle the freshmen
came oIV tl e field victorious.
We congratulate ourselves that
this antiquated and brutal custom
has been abandoned at the I of. M.
â€”U. ot M. Daily.
