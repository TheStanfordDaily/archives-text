# Associated Students Election
## 
### 
The balloting for the oflicers of
ilie Associated Students began yes
terday afternoon at one o'clock. At
three o'clock tho polls were closed,
and llie ballots were counted by
lladley, /ion, and Whittior, with
Smith as judge of election. The re
sult of the count appeared iu last
evening's issue. It will be seen that
hi tho case of balloting for president
Campbell had 134 votes, Capron
109, and scatteiing 21). A problem
of boiuo interest is brought up iu tho
decision of the election. The consti
tution provides tor a majority of all
votes east to bo necessary for an
eleeton. By counting, it will he
seen that Campbell lacks three votes
of receiving tho majority, if the scat
tering votes bo considered as having
been legally cast. Tho constitution
plainly does not cover the case in
hand. There is a clause which pro- j
vide.4 lor the nomination of candi
dates at a meeting to be called by
tho vice-president, but nothing is
said regarding tho balloting for all
candidates as to whother they must
bo nominated before the Associated
Students at this meeting. It the
constitution is to bo interpreted as
saving, by implication, that only
those who have been duly nominated
can be voled for, then the twenty -
eight scattering votes are illegal, and
are to bo thrown out, thus making
Campbell tho successful candidate.
It is argued that it is impossible
to throw out the scattering votes
without violating the representation
principle of the constitution. The
case is one of apparent equity in
which tho merits of tho case are
about equally divided. The decision
is a difficult one to make and it is
possible thr.t it will bo deferred for
several days, or until all tlie argu
ments have been fully weighed.
it is pretty welt understood that
an appeal will lie made if the scatter
ing votes aro not counted. Tho mat
ter will then have to come before the
Associated Students. If they re
verse the decision there will bo a new
election. In case the decision ren
dered recognizes tho scattering bal
lots then there must bo anothor elec
tion. It looks as if there must be an
election whatever is the decision.
In tho case of Sergeant at Arms
there were t)4 scattering votes, but
whether theso be accepted or lejected
thoro is no oloction. To provido
against any such ditliculty in tho fu
ture tho constitution ought to bo
amended to provide for cases ol
t lus kind.
