Tackling machines for football
praclico are becoming quito tlio
thing among tlio eastern teams.
Biown has used one with consideri
blo succcss so far.
This machine has now bocome nec
essary in ail institutions where sys
tematic football training is unilci tak
en. It is a we'll kno.vn fact among
players that tncklit-g a man surely
and in a proper manner is one of the
most difficult points to acquire. The
object of tho tackling lug is to bach
men to tackle from all points equally
well. First, at right angles from
both sides, with the bag approaching,
second, from the rear, and thirdly as
tho bag conies straight at them, cor
responding to a man going through
the line. Tho benefits claimed for
the machine aro that it gives the
player confidence and also teaches
him to jump as he tackles. The
Harvard team uses a maeheno in
vented by Cummock, captain of tho
champion team of '1)0. The body of
his ingenious device is covered with
leather, making it very slippery, and
consequently a man must hug it with
all his might in order to retain his
hold. There is a rim extending
around it, thereby compelling one to
tacklo low. It is extremely hard,
and a blow received from the full
force of its swing is no laughing
matter. â€” Hrnv:n lb rahl.
