Julius Goebei, Associate Professor |
of German Literature, was born in j
1857 in tho beautiful and historic j
city of Frankfort on the Main. In ;
1879 he entered the University of
Leipsic and for two years studied
Germanic and comparative philos- i
ophy; going from there in 18S1 to j
the University of Tubingen ho spent
one year in the study of Sanskrit, re
ceiving tho degree of Ph. D. in 18S2
Professor Goebei then came over to
America to join his father who had
emigrated in 1870; and was soon
after appointed instructor in Gor
man at the Johns Hopkins Univer
sity. lie held this position until
1888, when he was proffered, and ac
cepted, the position of Editor of the
"Belletristisches Journal" of New
York. This journal is the leading
literary and scientific German weekly
in America. After ably conducting
it for four years, Professor Goebei
resigned this summer to accept the
Associate Professorship of German
Literature at Stanford.
In 1883, at, the four hundredth
anniversary of the birth of Luther,
a little book on tho future of Ger
many, which Prof. Geobel published,
was received with a great denl of fa
vor by Ameiican and German critics,
Prince Bismarck himself sending a
letter of appreciation to tho disting
uished author. In the following
year he bsued another bo k, ''Leber
Tragische Schuld und Suehnc,'
which was also favorably regarded by
critics, and is now used as a test book
in the seminaries of various German
Universities.
While at tho Johns Hopkins I ni
versity he was one of the founders of
"Modern Language Notes," a phil
ological monthly, and had charge of
the department of German langua
ges, for which ho wrote numerous
essays and reviews 110 also pub
ished whilo at Johns Hopkins a
treatise on the popular songs con
tained in the "Limburger Chronik,"
a literary production of tho four
teenth century. This waste first
treatise on tho subject that had ap
peared and waR looked up:>n with
marked favor by all critics.
Numerous articles on literary,
scientific, and political questions,
from tho pen of Professor Goebei
appeared from time to time in the
"Journal" whilo ho was its editor.
The political articles again attracted
tho attention of Prince Bismarck who
wrote Prof. Goebei a number of in
teresting and encouraging letters.
(As Prof. Goebel's books are not yet
unpacked, we are unable to givo ex
tracts from the.e letters. In proof
of the high standing of the".Jour

nal" may be mentioned the opinion
of the London "Athenaeum" which
said that no other German weekly
was equal to it in the frankness and
soundnees < 112 its political opinions
and in the excellency of its literary
features. Professor Goebei has aho
lectured with great success in Balti
more, Philadelphia, New York, and
other cities. He is an ardent ad
mirer of America and things Amer
ican, being already one in spirit and
political convictions.
