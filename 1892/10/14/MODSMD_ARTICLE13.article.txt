"If the cinder patlia were only
fixed" is not a sufficient plea for the
men who have ntlilelic enthusiasm.
"If the roads were not so dusty" is
no longer a pica, since our recent,
brisk shower, for men to avoid daily
jogs on the roads or cross country
inns. While it is very satisfying to
the runner io pactise on a measured
ciourse.. to run on smoothed and lev
tied cinders, s-till it is not absolutely
lKCfSS.iry that he .should have'this to
train on In tlio first place a man
wants his heart and lungs in good
condition when he luns, and work
on a smooth or moderately smooth
path through the fields in just as ef
fective in this respect as work done
on cinders. If all that our athletes
needed was to get used to their
spikes on a cinder path thero would
bo no reason why a field day could
not take place on three days notice.
And there would be foiuo \alid ex
cuse for so much complaining about
the tracks not being in condition to
train on Men who aro anxious
to train can lind 11 means until such
enthusiasm in track matters is a
r.iused as to warrant a decided and
telling s'ep being taken to put the
tracks in order. Then, and not un
til then, as matters seem to stand
now, will the students at largo and
those who need a littlo coaxing and
a good example set them to go on
the tracks and ,ry what they are best
fitted for, give their assistance toward
making our tracks have anything
like the appearance of the Olympic
tracks. Jsut when enthusiasm is
once aroused and our athletic field
put in good condition, we will be a
college of athletes. There is noth
ing to prevent athletes from develop
ing into their boat possible form in
this climate and with these sur
roundings. We have the only 220
yards straightaway on the coast and
and the only 4 10 with but two turns,
and the nbsonce of turns on a track is
a great factor towards obtaining fast
time. Jf our tracks arc put in good
condition our own athletes will make
records fur themselves and for Stan
ford, and athletes from other parts
of the state will como hero to try for
records on cur straight tracks. So

far all the coast, records for 220
yards sprints and hurdles have been
made on a turn, and all the records
for 4-10 jtt'ds ami over liavo boon
made on the Olympic's track which
is six laps to the mile and rather too
narrow for largo entrees. Willi our
finder paths in prime condition it is
not too much to expeet I hat the
const championship games would be
held ou our grounds, and many of
our men would ho in tlio coutests
and make a good showing for them
selves.
