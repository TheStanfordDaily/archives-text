# Decision on Election

In 1 lio (;lection of liv-t \V* <1 noE(Jt*3 r
Campbell received 131 v tes, Capron
10!), and scattering 28. In deciding
on t 1 o results of the balloting there
was a doubt in the minds of the
Judge of Election and the Executive
Committee whether or not the scat
tering votes should be counted as
cast, or should be thrown out as il
legally cast. Arguments on both
sidos were heard, and it was decided
to count the scattering votos as le
gally eaht.
This necessitates a new election,
because • when the scattering votes
are counted there are 134 voLns cist
for Campbell and 137 east for othfir
candidates. As the constitution pro
vides th it a mnjoiit.y shall decide the
election, there is no election. The
Executive Commit ten haß called fora
meeting of the Associated Students
on Monday at 1:30 p.m. At that
meeting there will be new nomina
tions made lor president and ser
geant-at-arms. The election will pro
bably takf place the following Fri
day morning, that time being the
most convenient for nil to vole
