On Saturday evening all the delib
erative ability of our legislators was
focused upon a bill providing for
government ownership and control
of our railroads. r iho bill was re
ported from the committee on rail
roads by Mr Faris, and tho House
then went into committee of the
whole for its consideration, Mr.
Chamberlin being called to the chair
by tho speaker.
Speeches were made by Represent
atives Gruwell, Faris, and Messen
ger in favor of the bill, and by Rep
resentatives Hidden, Bledsoe, Ca'h
cart, Rose, and others against it.
The committee then arose and re
ported tho bill favorably to the
House. On motion of Mr. Rose, the
bill was referred back to the commit
tee on railroads to be amended, and
will come up again next Saturday
evening.
Mr. Hidden introduced the follow
ing amendment to the constitution
(Iloble maidens will please take no
tice): "To amend section two of ar
ticle one by striking out the word
'male,' so that the clause shall read:
'All students of tho L. S Jr. U.
shall be eligible to membership.' "
Tho now members made an excel
lent showing, and have in their num
ber some good debaters Fort rain
ing in parliamentary practice and in
fluency of speech, Congress is un
surpassed.
