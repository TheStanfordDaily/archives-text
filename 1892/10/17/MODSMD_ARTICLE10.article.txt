Football practice Las boon con
ducted so far in an extremely lux
fashon. There has not been enough
men out for practice regularly to
form a respectable class team. The
football manager should keep an ac
count of those who come out every
day, and let it bo understood that a
man's chance for the team depend*
on the regularity of his practice on
tho field and attendance at the gym
nasium work. This latter is very
impoitant indeed. Pledges should
bo drawn up and signed at once
Now the concert has provided
the money the field should be fixed
up. It should be marked out—
boundaries and five yard lines. It
feels as if through the thin covering
of sand, bed-rock had been struck.
Another field should be provided
soon. Tho management should
make a vigorous eliort to procure a
tackling bag. The practice games
should be timed and slopped early.
The players becomo interested and
play too long. The result is some
one is hurt and they all become very
still and sore.
There seems to bo no systematic
practieo in kicking. At present there
is no player in tho University that
kicks well enough for full back.
With Taylor as full back for Berke
ley wo will be lamentably weak in
that department unless moro careful
practice is begun. There seems to
be no practice in the field in drop
ping on tho hall. This might bo at
tended to in the gymnasium but at
present tho attendance at gymna
sium work is very light. There wore
hardly a dozen men there Friday
night
The coach Mr. Black, is at present
only able to bo on the field three
times a week. Why can it not be
arranged so as to allow him lo come
out every day? Tho class in the
gymnasium at 5 o'clock is not largo,
and every member would willingly
arrange to come nt some other time
for the good of the college, and the
good of the college certainly do
mands tho presence of tho coach on
the field every day. The Faculty,
of whose kind interest in student af
fairs we have so often boasted will

certainly sec that tin 1 football inter
ests shall rot ruflcr in 11.i• • respect.
The coach vii;!. \\v hope. app*\ir
