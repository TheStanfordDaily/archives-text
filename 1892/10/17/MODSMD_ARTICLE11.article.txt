Tiierf is football practice every
night now, nnd gymnasium work
three times ft week I>u ; . how long
does the practice in each case last?
The men, many of ihem, are always;
late; some conn; one night and stay
away tho next, while others never
come at all- Yet they expect to bo
candidates for the team when tho
time for the game-, comes
J low different in colleges that have
first class teams! Take Ann-Arbor,
for instance. There the men get.out
every forenoon from 10:30 to 11 ;30,
and every afternoon from 3:30 to 5
After their regular exercise of pass
ing tho ball, falling on the ball, and
calisthenics, the men take cross
country runs of several miles each
day. Quito a contrast one notices i
between this and our own training
Of course our great contest i; further
oil' than theirs, yet our men for the
most part are new and inexperienced
and consequently need much more
training. As yet no arrangement for
a training table has been ma le, and
in fact, there is not much prospect of
having one woi thy the name under
present environments. It is right
here that our proposed club house
would come into play, and be a won
derful incentive to athletics.
At present many of the men train
ing for the football team are scattered
from Ccdro Cottage to I'alo Alto and
May field. Until the men are brought
closer together s-o as to be handy to
the football field and gymnasium
exercises, we have great obstacles to
surmount. Not until wo have con
centration will the proper degree of
interest and enthusiasm lie aroused
to insure success.
