# Football Practice.
## 
### 
Friday the interest of the collego in
football was evidently at a low ebb
for ihere were not enough men out at
practice for two teams. However
seven men lined up on each side and
did some good work. The bucking
of Paul Downing and the tackling
of Krnnkenheimer were the features
Saturday a game between the
freshmen and a piclccd team was ad
j vcrtiaed but the same disgraceful
! state of affairs resulted as on Friday,
j Later seven of the faculty came
j out and completed the two elevens.
Richardson did good work at center
and Wing made some good tackles.
Sampson made several iuns, Swain
and Marx used their weight and
j strength to good advantage as guards.
If tlio faculty would come out and
practice they would Rolve the prob
lem of a heavy second eleven to buck
n gainsfc. With their weight, strength,
and fige tliey eould have a very strong
iino for their projected team. There
could then be four elevens and every
one who wanted to play football
could have a chance. Many men
have neglected to begin training from
; fear of having no chaucc to play
j when the first and second teams are
j chosen. With four elevens tho 'Var
i sitv could play ngainst a different.
] team every day and get much valu-
I able practico. Many new men would
| begin, among whom a few lirst-class
I players might b2 discovered. An
i inter-c!a c ÃŸ league might be arranged
The playing Saturday was a little
ragged many of tho mon were out
of training. Paul Downing and
Frankenheimer again did tho best
work for their respective sides.
