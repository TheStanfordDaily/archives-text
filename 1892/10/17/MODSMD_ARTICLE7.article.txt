# Junior Class Mooting.
## 
### 
Unrccogmzed on the ball iield,
the Junior Class have about deter
mined to strive for laurels in a new
sphere, and are seriously considering
the publication of an annunl. The
report of the committee on annual
at Friday's meeting was most favora
ble. It seems to bo the general de
sire to have an annual and the gen
oral desire to give hearty suppoit to
the undertaking should the Junior
Class assume the responsibility. The
committee asked for and were given
an extension of time for further in
vestigation. J. F. Wilson and 'J*. A
Keating are the members of the com
mittee.
The new constitution reported l>y
E. R. Zion was adopted without al
teration or amendment,. The report
of G. 11. Brown for the enmmitte on
baseball advising that further agita
tion in regard to a baseball nine be
dropped until later in the year, was
adopted.
