The scheme of getting a census of
the political preferences of the stud
ents of the University has often been
suggested, but none have taken the
responsibility of agitating the ques
tion and bringing it before the mass
of students. The idoa is a capital
one and one which is being dono in
eastern colleges with raicccfiS. At
the same time that this census is tak
en, the preferences of the fathers of
the individuals rright bo obtained,
thus showing what effect heredity
has on politics. Such an array of
statistics would be valuable, and at
the same time of interest to every
one. Why do net the two political
clubs take tho matter under consid
eration?
