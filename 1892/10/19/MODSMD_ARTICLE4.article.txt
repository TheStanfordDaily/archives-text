# STANFORD INTERVIEWED.
## How the Senator Will Dispose of His Wealth. 
### 
The Now York of Oat. loth
published an interview which it
correspondent had with Senator
Stanford in l'ai is recently. The in
terview is quite long and contains
much that is only of political inter
est. Such extract as might be of
interest, to the students are given I e.
luw. The interview gives an account
of tho senator's health, which, though
it is improved by the quiet summer
spent in Swiss mountains, is very
poor. He still walks with diOicuty
and has to be assisted into his car
nage. fie is sixtj'-eight years old,
he sa\s, and places no groat faith in
roluiit healih any more. Senator
Stanford's life interest has settled in ;
the University at l'alo Alto, which
ho built to the memory of Lis sou. ,
"It is to the l.eland Sumford Jr.
University that all the Stanford mil
lions will eventually go. The j
demands keep apace with tho work,'
he said, "but I am glul of it. It
; gives mo a chance to carry out those
plans with tho success of which 1
j desire that my name and life work j
i idiall be best known. 1 have |
boen impressed with the fact that of |
all tho young men who come to me;
will letters of introduction from j
friends in the East the mo.t helpless I
! class are college young men They i
j come from those I would like to
j oblige. They are generally prepos
sessing in appearance and of good
stock, but when they seek employ
ment, and I a?k I hem what they can j
(I > all they can say is 'an)thing.'j
They hue no defini'o technical!
knowledge of anything They have
no specific aim, no definite purpose, i
It is to overcome that condition, to
! give an education which shaU not
have that result, which T hope will
be the aim of this I'niversitj. lis
j equipment and faculty I desire shall
be S(cond to none in the woild. Its
capacity lo give a practical, not a
theoretical, education ought to be
accordingly for. most. '
"J have the greatest faith in the
possibilities of humanity. 1 want to
make my life work such that it will
teach others that same faith. Ocd
has always boen ben licet.t, and no
neccssary wauls of humanity have
been uusupplied But the use ol
them ought to be directed wisely.
To the end of teaching this T expect
to spend practically all my property
before 1 die. Of course there are
relatives whom I shall remember.
I do not care to disclore a i umber of
other public benefactions 1 shall
' make, but the bulk of my estate will

: <o the endowment ol' this practic
al university.
"It seems to me ihe moral duty of
j every man to give to the public weal
la liberal portion of his a-*-
i cumulations, and to do it himself in
his lifetime. I'm going to see if I
can't, spend money as we'l a ; anybo ly
else could do it. I do not kno.v
whnt I am worth Very few rich
men do. Investments v.ry ?.o much
!in value, according to market con
ditions. The bulk of my property is
i invested in ihe Southern Pacific
| Kailroad. Railroads bocome paving
investments only as business tlov«-l
-| lopis. Fixed charges remain substau
| tiully the same. Foi eleven years
! the railroad has been operated with
! dividends, but it has earned $10,000,
0;»0 above expenses, which has g >ne
! into improvements to its ultimate
financial benollt. I'ho stock n i\v is
worth li 7 to cents, but 1 expect to
| see it, with dividends, go to par
within three years. This wi.l accrue
to the endowment of the University."
Here Senator Stanford makes a
I long digression oil the subject of mon
ey as a medium of exchange. The
digression is only ofiuterebt from an
| economic standpoint and is omitted
' in this reprint.
Senator Stanford is reputed to be
! the possessor of £30,000,000 p.y
J his own estimate it will be trebled in
ilirec years, lie has made it all, and
his li e is approaching the end of
its actively. He was asked this
question: "Does wealth give happi
| ness V '
"No," lie answcrc 1 with pronipt
ncsss, shaking his head slowlv.
: "Happiness after the ordinal) com
forts of life arc possessed does iot
belong to any pot, rank, or condi
tion. (treat wealth involves great
care. It in care that kills. It is care
that puts one in my condition. If
wealth is intelligently used there
may come e< rtain happiness from itd
bestowal.
"Then why this incessant ruth
after wt alth?
'13read and butter is the fust nec
essary stimulus to labor, 'i'lien men
woik hard that, they may enjoy the
1 surplus fruits of labor. With our
s'audards of living and products of
; civilization a little does not satisfy
as a sufficient surplus. 'I lie natives
of I'anania who can count, but tin
will labor hard to reach that goal of
acquirement. 15ut that accomplish
ni( lit, satisfies.
"Why arc succe efnl Americans
seldom sati>li d unless increasing
wealth ol ready great?
"Activity has become habit. They
fire accustomed to living faster than
anywhere else in the world. Ma;y
iiif-u, too, fire not yet educated to
ell-joy anything but tho struggle i;s
self; That education will come i 1
ti no."
Th© millionaire was afcked if ho re
called any event which had proved
tho turning point or fluodtide oi' his
fortune.
"When he got married,''' reiuark
cd Mrs Stanford. The husband
smiled/in approval, aa'hegenth pat
ted the shoulder of ti is wife, who sat
near,him.
' Y'-s, that is rea'ly. so," ho o m
tinyed; ''hut there is another one.
or rather a sort of combination of
event*. My father, in a little town
north of Milwaukee, hunt turnpikes
and executed contracts of that kind

"What wouhl be your advice to a
young man Starting out in lile, as a
means of success?"
"First, be industrious; s-ecoml, have
a settled pi in; third, be everlastingly
persistent in both. These applied to
lair ability will win, tor all 10-iliina'e

there is one class of men only who
die rich. They are those who always
save something out of what ihey

They may make ninety-nine ucce-s
-fill speculations, but iu the hundredth
one when the risk is in proportion to
their tlaiing and their wealth, they
lose it all. Mr. Conk, financial agent
of our government, once told me
that tho largest check ho ever saw
was one drawn by Dan'cl Drew fm
