Tiif.re are registers for visitors in
the reception rooms of R>ble and
Encina halls. P>y moans of them,
students may see ,\ ho have visited
the University, and the daily paper
may obtain the name- of some of the
i uportant visitors for pub'ication.
In the Encina register of late espec
ially, and also for some time p-ist
noted names have been fictitious'}'
inscrib <1 in scrawling writing, and
imaginary names wi'h fan'ft'-tie resi
dences havo defaced (ho pages of
the book. .Judging from the dift'tr

childish sport.
Students of a university should
have enough manliness ab'juh them
to refrain from defacing property
and from marking a book which was
pi-iced whero i! i; fora definite pur
pose. In the column for remarks,
many little undignified and in some
cases unrefined phrases have been
written, no! only affer tho rames of
residents of Ktieina who have been
so vain as to register, bit also after
the names of strangers who have
re_istere land gone.
Su-ih little tilings as these, al
though done by only a few students,

consult the book. The opinion I hey
must form of University students

Individual sfudents should bear
in mind that wherever they aro in
dentified as Stanford students, any
childish or uneentlemanly conduct
they engage in brings odium not
upon themselves alone as individ
uals but upon Stanford students as
a body and upon tho University
which it thould bo every student's
pride to honor and respect.
