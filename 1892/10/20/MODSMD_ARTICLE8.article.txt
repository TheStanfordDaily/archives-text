# THE 						NEW FOOTBALL RULES,
## As Adopted by the American Intercollegiate Association. 
### 
The many inquiries made concern
ing the new football rules and
regulations have suggested that one of
the most profitable articles which we
could give to the readers of the Daily
Palo Alto would be a reprint of the
rules which will govern during the
present football season. The rules
which are to be published in to-day's
and to morrow's papers are taken
from Spalding's Official Football
Ouide, edited by Walter Camp. In
order to print the entire list we are
obliged to get out an issue on Col
umbus Day. There have been a
number of orders for extra copie√ü
sent to this ol'lice and in view of the
demand which we expect for to-day's
and tomorrow's papers a larger edi
tion than usual is to be issued.
