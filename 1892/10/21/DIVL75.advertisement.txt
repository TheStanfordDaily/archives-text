JUST A MOMENT!
I want to tell you a thing or two about this town. To com
mence with, it, is nearer ihe University buildings than any other
property that ever can be offered for sale. It is less than half a
mile from the University buildings. Every lot within this tract
is within easy walking distance of the class rooms. In fact, Col
lege Terrace is wholly within the bounds of the University domain.
Again: College Terrace also adjoins May field. It lies between
Mayfield and the Univertity. May field has more than a thousand
inhabitants, with churches, school houses, a newspaper, doctors,
lawyers, stores of all kinds—a town to supply all the necessary
and most, of the ordinary wants of man.
The center of College Terrace tract is less than seven blocks
from the center of Mayfield, nine blocks from the Mayfield de
pot, and is less than thirteen blocks from the center of the
College Quadrangle.
College Terrace is THE town for those who wish to locate
near enough to avail themselves of all the advantages such an in
stitution is sure to afford; Collie Terrace is Til IS (own for Fra
ternity Club Houses; College Terrace is TIIE town for Faculty
and Students; College Terrace is THE town for University
Hoarding Houses; College Terrace has every advantage that can
be advanced in favor of any other locality, and all the above ad
vantages in addition; therefore, College Terrace is Til E town
for Everybody, q. c. d.
"Nothing can excel as an investment, whether for homes or
profit, the purchase of lands adjacent to this magnificent institu
tion," and particularly residence locations in College Terrace.
