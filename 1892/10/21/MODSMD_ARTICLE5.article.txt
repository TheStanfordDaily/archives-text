The need of a grand stand lias
been greatly felt this fall since the
edict wont forth that no chairs or
benehea should he taken from Encina
under any circumstances. It is no
wonder that the games have lost all
charm for the young ladies when no
better accommodations are provided
for them than the hurdles, boards, or
the hard, hard ground. Even those
to a largo extent have been monopo
lized by the young men. It is hoped
that, in the future better accommoda
tion will be provided. It is reported
that the management of the
game have made special arrange
ments by which a sufficient number
of chairs and benches will be on
the ground next Saturday afternoon.
