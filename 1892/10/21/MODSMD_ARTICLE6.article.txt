# Word from Senator Stanford.
## 
### 
In this morning's Examiner is a
long interview with Senator Stanford,
who arrived in San Francisco yester
day The following is part of what
ho said about the University: "Mrs.
Stanford has purchased a number of
things for tho museum and both of
us wiU go down there shortly to
spend most of our time I'm think
ing of building a girls dormitory if
one is needed right away, and 1 want
to see if the expense of hoarding for
the students can not bo reduced.
While we are giving it to them at
cost price, I feel that it should be re
duced if such a thing is possible, be
cause I want to have the poor boy or
girl, or those who have to econo
mize, to feel that the University is
just tho placo to get an education at
the minimum of expense."
