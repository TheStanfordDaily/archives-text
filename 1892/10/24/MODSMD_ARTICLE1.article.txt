# Students at Senator Stanford's House.
## 
### 
Over two hundred and Jifly rnalo
students stood quietly under tha
trees in Senator Stanford's grounds
last Saturday evening when tbe word
was given to niovo toward tho house
to begin the serenade and to cheer his
welcome return from Europe. But
their coming was anticipated, for no
sooner had the noise from the grav
eled drivewayaunuunced that a great
crowd was almost under the win
dows than tho front door opened and
without further ceremony the boys
were invited in.
Tho large library and adjacent
halls could not bold tho throng which
poured in in single file, passing Sen
ator Stanford, Mrs. Stanford, Dr.
and Mrs. Jordan, who welcomed each
student with a hearty hand shako.
Then followed several selections by
the Encina stringed orchestra, a song
by Baker, '!)5, and one by Kennedy,
'05, after which Senator Stanford
arose and addressed the students.
His remarks were appropriate to tho
occasion, to the point, and well
chonen. They wore greeted with
rousing enthusiasm. All present
then joined iu "A Way Wo Have at
i )ld Stanford," and then, at Senator
Stanford's invitation, moved into the
great dining room, where sandwiches,
cakes, cookies, apples, grapes, figs,
iced creams, and lemonade awaited
the appreciative students.
After everyone had partaken of all
ho wished and left tho tables still
laden with edibles, Dr. Jordan made
a few pithy remarks expressive of
bis satisfaction at tho opportunity
which Stanford University had fur
nished him and his co workers to
labor in new fields and pursue a
broad and liberal causo in university
matters.
Tho boys viewed the beautifully
furnished rooms on the lower Moor,
and then bidding tho hosts good
night went out, where cheer after
cheer rang out on the night air and
died away in tho distance.
