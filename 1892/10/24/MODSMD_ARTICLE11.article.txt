Nothing would make a more inler

ent to keep thnn oiie which had
views, not of the Fniversity build
ings alone, which are 1 uilt solidh
enough to oullast any of eur lifetimes
and whoso appearance can be easil\
re:alletl, but pictuies of the scenes
wlrch distinguished the period of
tin ir college life and of the "faces of
those who, in after years, will bo re
membered only by the connection
they had with that period.
We urge the photographers who
are among us ec riously to consider this
mat or, if not from a (inaucial stand
point, at least for the pleasure it will
cause students to point to the old,
familiar scenes, and recall their act
ors. In other places interesting ath
letic groups, and series of football
and baseball groups are mounted on
plain panels and presented to the li
brary by the artist who took them.
Wo do net have a professional
photographer on our grounds once a
week, or even once a month. Let
some of our many amateur photog
raphers consider this matter, betas
see some pictorial record preserved
of our collego life.
