# Belmont vs. '95.
## 
### 
On Friday last the campus was the
scene of an exciting though one-sided
game of baseball. The opposing
teams, the 13elraonts and the ttopho
inoros, met merely fora practice
game suggested by the former,
which, however, proved very inter
esting. The Belmont team is com
posed entirely of the members of Mr.
Iteid's school noar Belmont. They
are a gentlemanly lot ot boys, wnich
trait immediately gained for them
many friends among the spectators.
The Sophomores, in tho absence of
two of their team, secured the ser
vices of Divey, ,( .)G, and Pauley, '9G,
