The game opened inauspicious ly,
i both sides being retired in the first
: inning without a run, which misfort-
I une seemed to follow the Belmont
I team throughout the game.
In tlie second inning tin Sopho
mores began their run-getting with
one tally. In tho third, the fifth,
and the sixth, by a series of hits
coupled with errors of their oppo
nents, the Sophomores scored seven
times. When the game was calloil in
the seventh, in order that soino of
the Belmonts might roach the north
bound train, the Sophomores had
twenty-four runs to their credit.
Iu the fifth inning Allen, the pitch
er for the Belmonts, had his linger
nail so badly torn by a Hy-ball that
he was compelled to retire from the
game, 11ollister going into the box,
and McLaine, '00, covering first base
Harelsoti, with tho exception of
two chances, gave a fine exhibition of
fielding. The other features of the
game were the hard hitting of the
Sophomores, especially White, and a
one handed catch by Downing.
