The new water which has long
been looked for is not such a great
improvement on the old. The lake
has boon for three years the reservoir
into which several sulphur springs
empty. This has sunk to the bot
tom, and when the new pipes lapped
it we got a very strong sulphur water.
As soon as we have had some hard
rains the water will become pure.
