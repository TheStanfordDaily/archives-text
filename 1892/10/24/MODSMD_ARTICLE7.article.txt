# '95's FIRST DEFEAT.
## Sophomores o, Freshmen 4. 
### 
T 10 opening football game of tho
season resulted in a victory for '90.
Much interest was centered in the
game as soajo of the promising plaj'-
ers for the Varsity team were to
make their debut. The most prom
inent criticism 011 the whole game
was the utter lack of life that char
acterized the playing. Rapidity in
lining up and putting the ball into
play never happened. Leisure and
hick of energy seemed to be the
proper thing. The quarters wero
slow in passing tie ball and to some
extent responsible for tho great num
ber of fumbles. Interference seemed
a minus quantify all through tho
game. As a general thing the tack
ling was good. The habit of oil'
side pbiying and fouling in practice
games showed its bad effect in Sat
urday's game.
At some stngos of tho game tho
playing was fine. Luut and Frank
enlioimer both did line work at tack
ling and very well as ground gain
ing halves. Jones punted well but
was somewhat handicapped in liis
other work by a sprained wrist.
Cochran bucked the center for small
gains and tackled in good shape.
L. McLaine tackled well. White
house did phenomenal work at cen
ter holding his man and snapping
the ball clean.
Codo with all his football experi
ence still mars his good playing by
high tackling and intentional foul
ing. Kennedy made some gaining
runs but demonstrated his need of
practice by his fumbles. P. Down
ing, although given tho ball but
once to go round tho end, played in
his usual good form. '95's center
men did not do tho work they should
havo done against their opponent's
light center. 0. Downing in his
usual quiet and unassuming way
did fine work at tackle. Ilarelson
by his coolness kept Jones' kicks
from counting for very much.
