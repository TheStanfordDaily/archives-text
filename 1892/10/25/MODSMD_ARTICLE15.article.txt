M. Ovide Musis, the great French
violinist, whose concert company in- j
duties Miss Annie Louise Tanner,
iho soprano coloratuie, Miss liuz
l'armenter, and Mr. Edward Scharf,
the pianist, will be in San Francisco
this week.
\\'e would suggest to the commit
tee appointed by the Christian
Association for the purpose of arrang
ing a scries of concerts to lake place :
in the chapel, that they made an
effort to secure M. Musin.
Such a tplendid opportunity to j
sccure one of llie best concert organ
izations in the United States at pros
ent does not occur very frequently '
and the committee should not let
this opportunity pass without action. ,
' Tiie arrival of Senator and Mrs. (
Stanford is an event looked forward
to by a largo number of students I
and professors. "While they were
on the continent the state of the
Senator's health would not p.rmit
his receiving any news fro.u Palo
Alto which would causo him to ba
come anxious about the University.
On his return, however, he has
been fully acquainted with the
state of affairs nt the dormitories
since his absence. The principal
complaint which has found it j way
to the ears the public is that tie
price of boar.l and lodging on the
grouuds is ho high that the students
were forced into the inconvenience of
seeking quarters in the adjoining
towns or of leaving tho University
entirely. Tho newspapers of tho
state have frequently made the state
ment that Senator Stanford was not
fulfilling his contract with the peo
ple, which was that ho would estab
lish a University where poor students
rriigh got an education.
The newspapers may have a grain
of truth in their statement but they
liavo possibly exaggerated the real
state of affairs. However this may
be, the affairs mismanaged tu* rightly
managed, are !o bo, rigliied ami that
shortly. Senator Stanford has taken
tho expense books of the dormitories
and in to have them thoroughly ex
amined with a view to getting an es
timate of the actual cost of the board
per student. This examination can
