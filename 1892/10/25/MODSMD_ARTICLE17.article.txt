Tho Harvard Crimson urges the
members of the two lower classes to
start a reform at that university by
ignoring the annual rush. It truth
fully says:"A rush consists of a

roar and confusion for above an
hour, disturbing tho peace, and at
tracting to the yard a crowd of

doing so. And aboveall it is a notice
able fact that there is no inclination
on the part of the entering classes to
revive tho old time battles. —Brown
Herald.
