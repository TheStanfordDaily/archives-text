# The 						"Rush" at Princeton.
## 
### 
The executive committee's action
last week in recommending the
abolishment of (lie annual "rush" is
important, as indicating, in a posi
tive way, the views which the men
prominently concerned in our a'h
letics entertain upon this subject.
Their action carries much weight,
and we are compelled to believe, from
many considerations, that the true
sentiment of the entire college would
be expressed Thursday in a vote of
concurrence with the recommenda
tion of the committee. College senti
ment in other institutions has ended
this objectionable and entirely use
less manifestation of clnss rivalry ;
and it is now the opportunity of
Princeton men to accomplish an end
which, in all customs of this nature,
can oii/ij be achieved l>y the expres
sion of the true popular sentiment
of the college If such action is tak
en as that ad viced, it is not improb
able that the cane-spree may be rec
ognized by tho faculty as a legiti
mate sport, and held annually at the
fall meeting of tho Track Athletic
Association. To this there can be
no serious objection. Aside from
tho considerations of sentiment and
tradition, the more practical plan as
suggested embodies all the necessary
features ol'an event of this kind,
with tho additional advantage of hav
ing the cane-spree conducted with
all that openness which should char
acterize legitimate athletic contests
of strength and skill, whatever their
nature.
Let the mass meeting bo well at
tended, that tho decision there
reached may be the expression of
the whole college.â€”rrincetoniau.
