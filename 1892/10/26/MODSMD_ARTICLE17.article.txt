J r is to bo regretted tliat not all j
young men who atteiul universities
have a proper regard for the 1 mild- j
inga and other property put there fur
their convenience. The benevolent
founders of this university have
spared 'neither time nor money to j
jualcu the buildings beautiful and con
venient. These are thrown open to
us without tuition. Aa a rulo they
mo well treated; but disfigurements
are beginning to appear here and
there. This ih not right. These
buildings arc made cf the bo.t of
material and have on thorn the lines',
of workmanship. It is a slnnie to!
disfigure with the >cratch of a pencil
a panel that it took hours to put the j

iiiii.-Ii on. It would bo tlte priile of
the University ai tl ii mruk of
respect to Senator and .Mrs. Stanford
to have iis walls rp, e.ir as well fen
ytars Vcnce as n >w. If lliese few
who have been so thou.ditl. 9S as tÂ»
make pencil marks where they do
not belong would refrain from fur
ther doing so, they would greatly
oblige the remainder of the U;.iver
si y.
