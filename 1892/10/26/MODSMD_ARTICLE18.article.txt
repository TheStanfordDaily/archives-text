Now that foo lull work has started
in real earnest, it is time to agitate
the question of a training table. It
h is been suggested that the room in
the west end e,f tlie gymnasium
might be titled up for this purpose.
If tie authorities would only giant
this permission, together with the
right to room in En ina, the prob
lem woJd be greaflv simpliiied.
Thii training table busiue.-s is not
some idle whim or fancy, but an ab
solute necessity. Surrounded with
the difficulties of our present situa
tion it becomes thÂ£ duty of the au
tliorities to do all they can in regard
to this important matter of a train
ing table.
