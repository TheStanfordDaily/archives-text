Dear Pir:
Several of the processors at the
University have Qxprtssed si desi:o to
me to be present at the launch of Un
protected Crui-er No. (i (U. S. S.
"Olympia,' ) which takes place on
the sth of next month. In order to
give an opportunity to those who de
sire to seo this launch, I would be
pleased to have you send me :i list
of the names of those who care to be
present, and I will have the proper
invitations sent to each one.
1 would suggest that the engi
neering clasnes at the University
have au opportunity to see this
launch, as the launch of a large ship
involves engineering questions that
should be of great interest to stu
dents following th â–  engineering
course. Very truly yours,
O. \V. Dickie.
If those wishing to attend leave
their names with Professors Mux
or Smith, it will be seen to that t! ey
receive invitations.
