To moruow the athletic; atnor.el
ments to the constitu.ion of tlie As
sociated Students come lip for con
sideration. Everyone should come
out. and show his appreciation for
tho welfare of the athletics of the
University l>y voting for their adop
tion. For the most part of last, year
we had 110 provision for athletics,
an<l as a consequence they were in a
chaotic state. Everything was car
ried on in an unconstitutional way
and usually to tho dissatisfaction ot'
the mass of students.
Tho amendments that appeared in
last Friday's Palo Alto have been
formulated with due care after con
sulting the athletic constitutions of
various eastern colleges. It is be
lieved by tho committee who drew
them up that they will acceptably
till a long felt need, and tend to fos
ter a proper athletic spirit here at
â€¢Stanford. It will bo seen in the
amendments that a graduate treas
urer has been provided for This is
to secure a man who has had busi
ness experience and training in a
requisite amount to place our ath
letie funds 011 an economical basis,
and provide against waste or impiu
dent expenditures. This idea has
been tried at Harvard and found
successful. A board of directors
chosen in the manner directed in t he
amendments is surely the best scheme
that could be hit upon where, in re
ality, we have no classts; at least,
none recognizee! by the faculty.
With a board of this kind divided
into sub-committees to look after tho
several distinct depirtmcnts of ath
letics in the I'Diversity, each depart
ment can expect to flourish and pro
gress with an equal stimulus. One
criticism might be made in regard to
tlio section referring to the election
of a captain of tho track athletes,
and that i.i, !; thin; either be fleeted
by tho athletes that entered in tho
1 ist, field day, or direct by tho sub
committee on track athletics.
To every one, then, who has tho
athletic welfare of the University at
heart, let i' strike home that only l>y

1 hi' adoption of a fit 4 ing* constitution
can our sitlilotic.s be placed on a
proper basis. Lot everjono who
comes bo prepared to vote accordiug
to liis own judgment and convic
tions, and not in accord nice with the
dictates of some el que.
