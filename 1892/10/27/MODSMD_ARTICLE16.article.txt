Aside from the physical training
and systematic practice daily for the
football foam a candidate should
k o\v eveiy one of the football
mils. The more a man knows about,
the game the be tter lie will be able
to act intelligently during
a game. Candidates should read
one or several ol' the small hand
books that are publi died on foot
lull, the better to acquaint them
selves with what they may never fee
in actual practice but what may oc
cur in a very important match game
and tiud them unprepared.
Again we urgo our football men
to learn tho rules. Last week in
Timtsday's and Friday's i-su s of the
Daily Palo Alto wo publi-d ed the
football rules in full so that they
might be seen by every student in
terested in the game and by every
player. The daily practice displays
the very evident ignorance of most
ol' tho players in regard to the rules.
It is certainly a slur on tho intelli
gence of our team that t hoy con
stantly train tin ir muscles and
nerves for the game but do not train
their intellects. AVhy would it not
be a good policy to have a quiz on
the rules about once a week?
