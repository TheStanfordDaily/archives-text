On the tmining tablo tho food
easiest digestible is (bo best; no cof
fce, soup, or pastry is good for this
reason. The nuat should bn of the
best kind, l>roiletl sirloin, mutton
i chops, and chicken are the best; eggs
I'are hard to digest, and are not good
for that reason. The bread should
bo stale or toasted; for diinks, cold
tea is preferable to anything else, but
even tea is sometimes dangerou*, for
too much of it may produce sdeep
j lessness; otherwise tea acls as a kind
of nervous stimulant, and a reasona
ble amount will prevent that drowsy
. and tloepy feeling which is experi
enced alter drinking milk. Plain
writer s'lou'd never be indulged in,
for the great amount that a player
will drink afier severe practice will
! not only dt crease the power of di
iges'ion by weakening the gastric
| fluid and consequently diminish his
j appoti'e, but as a general thing it
! will disorganize the stomach and
i 0
make a player entirely useless for
j hard woik. The potatoes should be
| baked or mashed, not fried, and a
few vegetables now and then will do
the men good For fruit, grapes,
' oranges, or poa'die. are the best; ba
nar as ami npj los should be avoided.
Oat meal or crac';cd wheat for break
fast may be safely indulged in, and
to break the monolony of such a lim
ited bill of fare, a dish of tapioca or
rice pudding for diniKv will do the
m< 11 a gr(at deal of rood. ll' it can
be so atranged, the be it time (o have
dinner is at night, and luncheon at
noon. v\ player feels less inclined
to work haul after a liearly meal. â€”
