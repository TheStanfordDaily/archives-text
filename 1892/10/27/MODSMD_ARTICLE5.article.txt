Pulo Alto now boasts of an organ
ized tennis club. "Palo Alto Tennis
Club" has been selected fora name,
and Ward Hannister has been chosen
president. DcLong, Campbell, and
Bannister c nstitute the executive
committee. The club has a beauti
ful clay court situated between
Elsinore I'lace and Romero Hall and
is composed of about twelve members.
The Stettin continuous-tournament
system was adopted in the constitu
tion which is expected to stimulate
playing and lo create great interest
among the members of the club.
The systom provides fora grading
of the members of the club in a tour
nament after which any member can
challenge tho man next above him
in rank to a match at any time. If
the man challenged fails to play in
two weelcs ho drops down one place
in the rank of players, thus making
a continuous tournament.
The club contains fomc of the
best players in the I nievrsity and
contemplate inviting their friends to
participate in the near future in a
country tournament which they pro
pose to hold. Tape lines,back note,
etc. have been piocurcd; the court
rolled and everything fixed for play
ing on tomorrow. A mistake was
made at. first by puttingon too much
sand but this was overcome by a top
layer of clay being added which
makes a very pretty court.
