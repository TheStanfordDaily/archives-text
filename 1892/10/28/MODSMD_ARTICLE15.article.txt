Some anxiety is being fe'.t by our
baseball players over Ibo fact tha*
the Unive'vity of California nine is
using every avail ible chance to prac
tice. It is being agitated to form a
baseball league at once find begin
practicing. The scheme is not an ad
visable one. If any considerable in
terest is aroused in base-bill at pres
ent there will of necessity be a de
crease in football, and we can not af
ford to dissipate our energies. Then
again, if practice is begun now it
will have to be practically discontin
ued during the rainy months of Jan
uary and February, and llius the
team will be but little stronger for
the two months playing which they
can have now. Also, many of the
best baseball men are trying for i>o
sitions on the eleven, and ngiating
baseball can not best receive much
encouragement.
Football is only just beginning to
boom here as it should. Yesterday
both o? the fields were in use, and
four coaches were at work. Nnv
that it is receiving more attention,
wo ought to give it uii ii:e encour
agement we can. The game ng .inst
the University of California was eas
ily won, but this year may not see
our adversaries so weak, even if it
sees us stronger. The invincible
Olympics nearly lost to us by their
over-confidence. The University of
California did lose to us for that
reason. What ii' we should lose the
games this year from that same
fault! We have it over Sir. Porter's
signature that, the I . C team will be
one of the strongest in the countn
outside of the intercollegiate league
Wo have it from the same sourc.; that
their team is doing very ear, fid and
systematic training.
