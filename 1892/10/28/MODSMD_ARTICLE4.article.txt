### 
In the chapel last evening there
was given an interesting lecture on
Yosemite Valley, illustrated by a
great number of excellent photo
graphic steroptican views, which in
cluded some fro:n the ]'Â»ig Tree
Grove of Calaveras. Mr. llutchinps,
the lecturer, was in iB.js the loader
of the first party that ever ex
plored Yosemite, though a starch
party after a band of murderous In
dians some years before had vague
ly reported the ditcoveiy of a val
ley with a waterfall 1000 feet high.
Among the views were many
taken from points not usually visit
ed by summer travelers, and inter
est was given to the various feat
ures by stories connected with them.
Mr. Hutchings gave some idea of
the life and habits of the Indians in
the valley, and closed by bringing us
back home with a moonlight
on Wan Francisco ba^.
