# Mention of Two of Our Scientists.

### 
The speakers at the Farmers' In
stitute held in Niles last Saturday
were the best that havo ever ad
dressed that body at any of its
meetings Without doubt the two
bc-t lectures were "lusectivorous
Birds," by W. VV. Price, of Palo
Alto, and "Insect Friends," by W.
G. Johnson, assistant professor of
entomology at Palo Alto. The two
subjects were handled so well that
the listener came away with a good
knowledge of his fiieuds among the
birds and bugs. A point worth no
ticing is that both gentlemen used
the homely names of the fellows tliey
t diced about, only using the tech
nical names when no common onos
were named. Each speaker, too,
made admirable suggestions to the
fanners concerning the protection of
beneficial birds and insects. The
other subjects were handled as ably,
no doubt, and weie extremely inter
esting, but these two were most im
portant. â€”Oakland Enquirer.
