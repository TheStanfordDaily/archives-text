# THE
						INAUGURAL.
## The
						President of the United States Addresses the House Upon the Issues of the Day. 
### 
Those who attended Congress last
Saturday evening upon the occasion
of tho inauguration of President F.
C. Clark, were treated to an ;dde and
olo<|uent exposition of the economic
and political questions of the day.
Mr. Gruwell, Speaker of the
liou.se, called to order and intro
duced the President, who spoke
about thirty minutes.
President Clark prefaced his ad
dress hy a lew words relative to the
intimate lelati.ms of teacher and
pupil. The necessity of mutual n>-
sistance and support, and the espec
ially favorable relations thus far at
Stanford. It was ;ss a representative
of this idea, he said, that he had un
dertaken this office which the stud
ents had been pleased to confer
upon him. lie then spoke briefly of
the nature of the organization, and
iLs aim as stated in thee nslitnti. 11
10 "provide an opportunity, ie
marking that in these words the; c
lay not only the key to the aim uf the
Stanford Congress, but to the aim of
the great University as well. ' Put
this opportunity, ' said l'rof. Claik,
"will secure a reward only common
surate with your assiduity in usher
it,"a remark which lie made the ba
sis of an eloquent appeal to the mem
bers for haul and conscientious work
The speaker then turned his at
tention to some of the ] olitical prob
lems that confront us. The first one
considered was that of laws —the
need ol more and bet or legislation;
not so much quantity as quality;
laws that will voice the sentiments of
the people. The making of a law
ought to ensure its enfo:cement, yet
such is often not tho case, for then
is not the public sentiment to a cure
this enforcement. The plesent rail
road probloms and the civil * A vice
reform questions are both illustra
tions of this. Government control
of quasi-public service, and a six
jear term of office for the prcsid nt
were then touched upon.
Prof. Clark turned next to our in
ternational re 1 if ions, referring brie fly
to the Bering sea arbitration, sug
gesting a permanent national b.-ard
of arbitration to moot such eme rgen
eios in future. Our intimate rela
tions with our neighbors was then
tiken up; with Canada em the north:
the Alaskan boundaries, the fi her
ies, canal toll-, trade relations, and
annexation; 011 tho south: the Mexi
can boundary, pan-Aincricnn trade,
prospects fora railro ul with the
south, and the Nicaraguan canal.

The President then pointed ont
the difficulties of adjusting a consti -
tution made when the resources and
future commercial greatness of tte
country were unknown, i.c the need*
of the vast domain, flourishing in
dustries, and world-wide commerce
of the United Sta'es of to-el iy. In a
hundred years there have been but
five amendments to the constitution.
We have to interpret that instrument
by tho enactments o! congress; hence
the atieled neeel for prudence and
wise statesmanship.
lie then discussed briefly four elis
tiuct political issues of the present
day. Firstly, trusts, railroad com
bines, and all other influences which
le nd to the concentration of capital
in the hands •. 112 the few, with the
grave social ejuestians these bring
up Secondly, the organization o
labor, which recent troubles in the
East have made prominent; the ne
cessity for the adjustment of thes?
eliJYereneie - between labor and cap
ital, not by conflict, but by confer
ence, that the wheels of industry be
not stopped. Thiielly, tho neeel of
i rotectiug our national institutions
from the underminrag influence ol
foreign immigration; and did we but
devote mure of our attention to the
producer and less to the product, the
tariff ejuestion would become, as it
should,.simply one of financial ex
peelicncy. Fourthly, the silver ques
tion: fundamental economic laws
must bo obeyed, because o. r coui
u orce is carried em in a fixed bullion
with other powers; the question i
how to make our enrcula'ing medium
elastic and eeuial to metal of inter
national value, Such a; 0 some ol
tho great problems of our time;
problems which must be settl d by
congress in fair ehibate; for it is only
through congress th it we can get a
true consensus of the sentiments of
this- grest republic.
The speaker closed with a Stirling
appeal for more men to take hold of
and solve these problems; for men
who place country abovo party, artel
fora deeper and more heart felt in
terest on the part of Ameiiean cit
izens in tl e fortunes and destinies of
this great republic.
