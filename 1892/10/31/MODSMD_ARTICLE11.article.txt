### 
The eastern football plot is thick
ening. Yale seems to bo stead.'y'
improving— something Vi;
of hor in tlio years when slie is enj>• I
1 osed to liavo infoiior talent. in e\-
ery one of hor games she has shown |
marked change for tho bettor, and j
tier work against, the Orange athletes
Saturday indicated that she would
be "in it" at the finish on Thanks
giving day. On tho other hand,
Harvard and Princeton also put up
tho hardost kind of gomes, and
about the only thing conclusively
demonstrated by the day's results
was that Yale's weaknesses had been
advertised a little prematurely.
The value of fine coaching was re
markably demonstrated in tho game
between tho University of Chicago
and the Northwestern elevens at the
south side grounds in this city. The
University of Chicago team was sup
posed to be a comparatively week or
ganization, despite its great leader,!
Stagg, but instead it had the best ol
tho battle all the way through witlr
tho Northwestern. Neither side,
however, was able to score, and the
game was slopped by darkness.
Btagg's men had tho ball at North
western's line several times, but in
every instance Capt. Noyes saved the
day by a long punt.
