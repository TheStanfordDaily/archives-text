University of California vs. Olympics. !
Tho football gamo between the >
I nivcr.-ity of California and the
Olympic teams at Central Park last
Saturday, was attended by quite a
numbe. of our team and several of
ill fa< uliy. It was a little disappoint
ing, t'- say tie leas-t, and showed
many weak points on both teams.
Although it begin by quick and
rough ]>1 ijiiig, after a few minutes
play became so slow us lo bu vei\
tiresome, and the audience did wish
they would put tho ball in play.
The runs around right en 1 and goal
mud'j by kick from near the touch
line, and tho lino work of Porter
and Dr. Wood avo worthy of mention. |
The University played tho criss
( ross v ry effectively, but if the end
men on tho Olympics had not been
weak their !>ains would have been
i
loss.
Tho Olympic team continually
p iiinded the center of their oppo-[
nenla for gains, Their superior I
weight was very < ITective. The ball!
was lost to both snJcs many times |
because of the .slowness with which
tho ball was handled behind the
lino.
Slugging was a characteristic of'
unino ir.du'ged iby both sides I
a thing which decidedly spi its the
pleasure of any game for its admir
ers. Another noticeable feature was
the exceptionally large number of
limes that the game was delayed on
account of Occidents on both teams

—two of tlio U. C. men and one of
the Olympics requiring substitute 6.
It was evident to one accustomed
to football that the teams were fur
from being in training, else they
would not have become winded so
easily or hurt so often. The loss of
Hunt, in the first half, very much
weakened the playing of the uni
versity team, as may ho seen by the
score, which was 4 4 at the end of
the first half, and at the close was
20-10 in favor of their opponents.
Now a few lessons our own team
may draw from this game:
Ist. —Play fast. It increases the
interest of the audience and very
much strengthens he play. In or
der to do this, every play must ba
worked out and every man must
know just what ho is to do each
time the ball is snapped back.
2d.—lt pays to bo training—as it
lessens the chance for accident and
helps to put snap and dash into the
last half of the game.
31 —Play a gentlemanly game.
It saves energy for the play itself
and helps to elevate the game in the
minds of the people.
