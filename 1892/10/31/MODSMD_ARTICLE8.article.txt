Ooh running tmck presents a de
plorable stato at present. Not con
structed on the proper plans in the
iirst place, it has been neglected un
til it is entirely unfit to hold any
lund of a field day on. To all those
men who nro anxious to train it is
quite a source of disappointment and
discouiagement to see nothing done
from day to day towards putting the
track in shape. Something must bo
done. Delay means a fatal thrust at
track athletics. The interest in this
part of our athletics should not be
allowed to die out, especially under
our most favorable climatic con
ditions. Very soon the football
season will bo over and the en
thusiasm that has been centered
along this line will have no channel
of escape until the baseball season
opens next spring. What is to be
done during the winter? If matters
are continually put oil', we shall
finally awaken to the fact that our
men havo no place to train on, or to
hold a field day next spiing.
If the student body should con
clude to investigate the matter of
how much it would cost to fix the
track in anything like respectable
condition, fivo hundred to a thous
and dollars would bo found to be a
very low estimate. The track of the
Olympic Club alone cost six thous
and dollars. The track will havo to
be sunk ten or twelve iuchcs, and this
tilled in with crushed rock, sand and
cinders. This work, together with
the curbing, which must be put in if
records are to be allowed, will ho
very expensive, especially if anything
like the recent repairs on our football
field. Tt, is a pity the proper author
ities cannot bo aroused to the im
portance of this question. It. is 0110
of which our track athletes are
patiently awaiting the outcome,
hoping that the trend of affairs may
take a hasty and fortunate turn.
