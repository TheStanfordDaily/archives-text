Thru p. have boon some objections
to tbo way in which the football
games have been written up in
times past. The articles which have
appeared in the Palo Alto have
been .simply the embodiments of the
criticisms of persons competent to
judge of good playing. They were

given inn fnir and impartial spirit
for tiie beet interests of athletics.
Bvery one understands that it is
only by honest, criticism that we can
hope to improve That tbe Harvard
Crimson thinks revere criticism is a
good thing the following extract
shows:
Acton played poorly both in
blocking and getting through, ami
his inteifercnce was of but little
use Mackie, who litis p'ayed cen
ter before, did not play at, all will;
he was slow in getting the b. 11 into
play and was outplayed by Urice
TralTford did fairly well but was
handicapped by 1 is spraiuc d wrist.
CrÂ»go played a brilli:mfc game, tack
-1 ng well, and also made many good
iuns with tho ball. The inteifer
cnce was veiy poor, tho tacklcrs
were not knocked down a? they
should have been, but were only
pushed aside and very naturally
tame in behind tho interference and
got the runner. This was done re
peatedly and should bo stopped
There was also too much hand in
terference. The lino men did not
show up at all well, and the second
i leven bucks made repeated gains
through the center and around the
ends, especially the right end. The
men started fro n their positions bo
fore tho ball was snipped back, of
ten giving the pity away and caus
ing a change of the signals. 'Ilus
fault certainly should be corrected.
