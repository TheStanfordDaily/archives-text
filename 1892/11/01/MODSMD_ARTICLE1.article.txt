Mary Sheldon Barnes, Assistant
Professor of History, is a native of
New York state. In 1871 she en
tered the University of Michigan as a
classical sophomcrve; but having a
strong tnßte for science, all her elect
ives were taken in scientific branches
with special attention to physics.
It wrs by what was little nioro than
merecliance that Mrs. Ramos became
interested in hi tory. After gradua
tion, while waiting for an opening
in scieuce, she was forced to teach
history and became much interested
in the problem of applying scientific
methods to historical rrsearch. She
became convinced that history did
not consist entirely in the reading
of some secondary and later author
ity; but that bjck of the dessicatcd
general statement of the modem
author, time lay many almost for
gotten writers who had faithfully
portrayed the spirit of their times in
some important pha c e. just as the
fossil preserves and portrays to the
geologist the life and conditions of
past ages. This reality she found in
the source, and thus became an un
concions follower of Konkoand the
methods of the German Seminary.
In 1887, after refusing the professor
ship of chemistry at Wellesley Col
lege, she accepted the chair of history
at the same institution, holding it for
nearly three years, when she re
signed on account of ill health 1 *80
and 'SI were spent in Europe, the
first year in travel and the second in
historical study at Cambridge Uni
versity under Prof. J. It. Set-ley. In
1885 bhe J üblished a text book en
titled "Studiesin General Ilistcry."
(Heath aud Co., Boston), a work
■which met with a very largo success.
In this same year she married Prof.
Earl Barnes, and shortly after, in
connection with him, began work on
a text book on American History de
signed to give the high school
student an acquaintance with the
original sources. This work also
met with an unexpectedly large suc
cess. In ISB7 Mr. and Mrs. Barnes
accompanied Prof. Burr of Cornell
to Europe to spend a year in the
collection of materials from the
sources, for the use of Mr. Andrew
D.White. Besides the above books
Mrs. Birnes lias from time to time
presented many papers aud articles,
largely on the subject of the use of
the source in the stud}' of history.
