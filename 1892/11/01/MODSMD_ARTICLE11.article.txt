We Lave been asked if the early
instructions given the young ladies
in Roble last year about not bowing
to young men are still in vogue. We
can not say. But it seems to us that,
the first coufuscd period of college
life is past, and tbat the young ladies
can with the utmost propriety ob
serve those little acts of politeness
and those forms of society which it
certainly must have been their cus
tom to uce and see used at home.
Because tins is college life is no rea
son why many little acts which have
long been recognized as good
etiquette should be thought unnc ces
sary on the campus. We come to
college not to become boorish pedants
but to obtain a broad and liberal
education; to acquire a polish in in
tellect and manners which a univer
sity education is supposed to give.
