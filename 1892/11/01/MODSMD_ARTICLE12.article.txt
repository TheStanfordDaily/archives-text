Yesterday's Associated Student
meeting showed that there are a
great many persons here who would
willingly run athletics, the very
branch of college life which it should
be everyone's unbiased aim to foster
and encourage, into politics. What
we want is the best man in each posi
tion in the management of athletics.
AYo cannot afford to let some faction,
some one fraternity, or several com
bined, run matters not for the general
good but to satisfy some personal
feeling for or against a man, a clique,
or a fraternity.
It is getting late in the season.
AVe have not any more time to waste
in dallying over matters that are of
vital importance to the foundation
and growth of athletics here. Men
cry out and want to know why the
track is not fixed and why we do not
arrange fora field day, and they are
the very ones who, by staying away
from such a meeting as yesterday's,
where if they went and exercised
their individuality in voting after
carefully thir.king over matters for
themselves and not waiting for sonio
one to tell them how to vote, would
help to txpress the general senti
ment of tho student body, instead of
allowing a non-representative few
to form themselves into factions ami
vote not as intelligent individuals
but as a unit, the excuse of which is
expressed by "you nvj√üt vote with
us because that other gang is trying

lo run it a'l tbelr own way, and then
we want to bent so-and-so and keep
him from get ing any position."
Students, Uy aside your partisan
ship in this matter. It, coneeras
your own ftood.f r it concerns tlie
good of the Unlversi'y and the rep
utation of its students for enterprise
and common sense. Come to the
next meeting determined to work for
the good of the Univer.i'v. Lay
a i ide a'l person il ftelings, and above
all tilings assert your individuality.
