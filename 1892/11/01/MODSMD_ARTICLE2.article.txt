# Football Practice.
## 
### 
There is fin encouraging sign in
that iho men played faster last night,
than at any time yet. On the other
hand, it will be noticed that reven
of the twenty-two were absent. Two

were excused, but the others were
not. This does not look very
auspicious. Kvery man should have
football at heart enough to get ou'j
and tiain, and not stay away on
account of a few insignificant brines,
or some little inconvenience. In
selecting the team this matter of
training, howevi r, will be taken into
consideration. The interference was
very poor last night. The halves
ran too far out ; the ends did not do
their share of tackling; the center
men do not get down low enough,
and they loave too many lio'es. In
tackling the runners, the blockers
should lie shoved into the man with
the ball more. The ends should
tackle from behind the blockers —
something scarcely ever seen here.
Another great fault of the ends —
they never get down the field on a
kick. Few hi 0 h tackles are seen on
the field nowadays. Men for the
center position are in demand at
present—heavy men, with the requis
ite amount of agility. Prof. Samp
son and L'lof. Wing did the coaching
last night.
