There are doubtless few of the
students residing in San Francisco
who have not heard of the famous
baritone, Mr. Donald de Y. Graham.
When the opera "Bluff King Hal"
was produced at the Grand Opera
House under the auspices of the Art
Association, it was Mr. Graham who
made the most emphatic "hit" of the
production. He was received with
immense and well-deserve d enthusi
asm; and the smooth and flowing
verse of Mr. OVonuell, as well as
the music of Mr. Stewart, were both
greatly enhanced by the extraordi
nary charm, beauty, and passion of
Mr. Graham's singing. Ho has a
rich and pleasant baritone voice,
well balanced, true, sound, resonant,
and admirably trained.
To those familiar with the exquis
ite, velvet-like quality of Mr. Gra
ham's voice, the fact of lis engage
ment fora concert to to take place.in
the chapel of the University will be
most welcome news. Associated
with Mr. Graham will bo a pianist,
violinist, and 'cellist, â€”Mrs Car
michael-Carr, and Messrs. Beel and
Heine.
It is the intention of the commit
tee, appointed for the purpose, to
make this the first of a series of pop
ular concerts. Heretofore there has
been a lamentable dearth of musical
entertainments at the University,
and therefore both the facuHy and
the students should contribute to
the success of the scries. This they
can do by subscribing to the guaran
tee list for one or more tickets. This
list will bo ciiculated among the
students by members of the com
mittee, and may also be found at the
Registrar's office.
