# Halloween at Theta House.
## 
### 
The Kappa Alpha Tlietas, to
gether with about a dozen of their
gentleman friends, observed the old
time custom of Halloween last even
ing. Delightful music was furnished
by Mr. Thomas and the Messrs.
Magre. The various games were
stopped at a late hour, when refresh
ments were served. Then all pres
ent, draped in sheets, gathered
around the large open fireplace and
told ghost stories in the dim light
until midnight.
