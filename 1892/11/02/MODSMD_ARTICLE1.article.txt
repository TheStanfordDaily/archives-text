# AT THE WORLD'S FAIR.
## How Greek Letter Fraternities will be Represented at the Columbian Exposition. 
### 
Through the kindness of Mr. J.
li. tlitt, Jr . ro].resentator of
Phi Delta Tiieta at tho mooting ol'
fraternities for the provision of the
World's Fair exhibit, the Daiia
Palo Ai.to has been able to obtain
the data, which are given below.
The matter of being represented
at the World's Fair is one discussed
by fraternities for some time. Nolh
ing definite was done until June Hth,
last, when representatives of twenty
live of these organizations met Dr
Peabody in Chicago and received
from him the assurance that space
would he given them providing the
display be made concise, significant
and forcible. A special committee
then presented the following report
which was adopted:
"This meeting recommends to ali
college fraternities and societies
that their exhibits at the World's
Columbian Exposition consist
among other things, of their eala
logues, song books, magazines,
badges, tlags, banners and souven
irs of particular chapters, escutch
eons, coats of arms, pictures ol
chapter-houses, of active and alumni
chapters and members, and what
soever is of interest in showing
their history and present status,
and that provision be made for the
registry of members of fraternities
who visit the exhibit, and that each
fraternity appoint a delegate with
full po.\ er to act for it, evidenced by
cr< dentials, in the matte r of repres- 1
entation at the World's Columbian
Exposition."
On the following day a perma
nent organization was affected and
constitution adopted. The organ
ization was styled "The College
Fraternities Exhibit Committee."
Each fraternity is to have a single
representation in tho organization.
They have worked assiduously to
mako the exhibit thoroughly rep
resentative of tho fraternity system,
and have shown a liberal spirit in
subordinating their own fraternity
interest to the welfare which was in
ti listed to them.
The plan for exhibit contemplates
a space 4<> feet in length along one
of the main aisles of tho Manufact
ures and Liberal Arts building. It
will be 1!) feet deop. On three
s des, walls from 8 lo I'J feet high
will be erected and on the fourth,
next to tho aisle, an ornamental
railing will be placed, with ace n
tral entrance f>r those who wish to
examino the exhibits. The rear

I portion of the court so formed will
be divide el by winged frames, giv
ing increased wall space, which
will be sub-divided as the partici
pating fraternities determine. Thnse
frames will be about 10 feet high
and will extend N feet into the court.
It is estimated that many fraterni
ties will not require n.ore than one
half or less of the space provided on
each side of those frames. To larger
and older fraternities one side en
tire will be given, making 80 square
feet of space. These arrangements
are similar to those of othor organ
izations.
In the main, tho form of exhibit
which will probably be followed by
all the fraternities similar to that
which has been adopted bj r one of
the larger organizations. In this it
is designed to utilize wall space
about six feet wide by ten l'eet high.
A book-case, eighteen inches deep,
four feet wide and four and one
half feet high, with glass front, will
contain a collection of the publi
cations of the fiaternily, bound vol
umes of its magazine, its catalogues,
; song books, musical compositions
and other general publications, as
well as those of tho chapters. On
I each side of this will bo sta'ues
I emblematical of the fiateruily.
Above will bean illuminated map of
the United States, showing the lo
cation of the chapters and relative
density of this fraternity's popula
tion, and at the top, amid the draped
flags of the fraternity, will be shown
a large reproduction of its badge.
Upon the remainder of tie wall
space will be hung portraits of its
founders, pictures of ils general
fraternity home, of its chapter
houses and of prominent members,
an illuminated roll of ils chapters,
trophies and emblems, statistical
charts, etc. On the top of (he book-!
case will be placed va .es containing
tho fraternity flower. Facing the!
aloves are long show cases in which j
will be placed articles of interest to
all fraternities, and upon tables be
tween these will be placed registry
books.
Further meetings of the Exhibit.
Committee are provided for on Nov.
orelanel Dec. Ist, when the space!
will be allotted to the different or- 1
ganiz itions. After this time no
further applications will bo eon-!
eidered.
