The New York Evenimj /'oat of
Oct. JKtli publishes a long article on
the subject of English at Harvard
and elsewhere. The article is called
forth by the report of a committee
on composition and rhetoric to the
board of overseers of Harvard. It
appears from the report of tho com
mittee that in the prescribed English
course for tho freshmen more than
GOOD compositions are handed in,
criticised, and returned for correct
ion every hulf year, and that the
number of written exercises handed
to the English department during the
year is estimated to lie not less than
ilB,ooo. Even under the most favor
able circumstances the correction of
such a mass of manuscript is hut lit
tle hotter than drudgery, but the
report of tho committee further
states that a largo majority of these
compositions aro prepared in the
most slovenly manner. Inmatuiei
thoughts are tet down in a crabbed
and illegible hand, miserably express
ed and wretchedly spelled; and yet I
the average ago of admission is j
nineteen.
In order to find out more definite
ly the reason fcr this deficiency tho I
examining board submitted to the!
entrants of' this year a list of ques-1
tions tho answers of which would
display tho character of Englsh in
struction given in the fitting schools.
Some 450 papers, representing about
40 different fitting schools, were ob
tained and these form an interesting
part of the committee's report.
They show a surprising deficiency of
method on tho part of instructors of :
English in some of tho best fitting
schools of tho country. To quote
the /W, "Tho exhibit is enough to!
raise a blush to the cheek of every !
principal who reads tho report, and
the board of overseers will take care j
that none go unsupplied. But tho
public at large will never fathom the
depths of the prevailing neglect of
our mother tongue until a corres
ponding exhibit is made of the pro
ficiency of tho graduating class at
Harvard; for (hen it will appear how
little i> and probably can be d mo in j
four years of higher education to
overcome ho illiteracy which is'
brought to college."
Of tho applicants for admission to I
Harvard last Juno nearly one-half |
were conditioned. The report of
the committee recommend that slill
greater rigor be used to bring the
preparatory schools to a sense of the
importance of English as tho found
ation of advanced study. The
committee now bid them to teach the
vernacular, i.e.,tho wiitten English
"as an incident, not an end." They
hold up as an example one school in ,
which tho preparation of Englishj
was carried out 111 every other sub
ject. "My tiauslations from other
languages," says a pupil, "were
carefully criticised for their Knglish:!
my geometry propositions I have re-1

written many ti-nes on account of
poor English."
This report of tho Harvard com
mittee will doubtless be the primary
agent in starting throughout this
country, it not a revolution, at least
a reform. The demand of the col
leges and universities have always
been the guides which have marked
prominence or insignificance of the
various subjects in preparatory
schools. It has become a matter of
considerable comment that large
numbers of college students express
their thoughts in writing very poorly.
The fault is not to be attributed to
anything else but their preparatoiy
training. These same students may
show exceptional abi'ity in mathe
matics and elementary science, a
tact which argue* that their tr lining
lias not b(.eu symmetrical. California
is not supplied with a very large
number of high schools and acad
emies. From the necessities of our
situation ami settlement these
schools have been somewhat b .-hind
the older settled states of the union
in the general education which the}
afford to their students. The de
partment of English, however, is by
comparison n uch more advanced
This excellence is due la'gelv to the
influence of Pi of. A. ft Cook, now
of Yale but formerly of Herkeloy.
While on this coast Prof. Coolc
worked energetically in rai iug the
standard of tho department of Eng
lish both in tho State Iniver-itv and
also in the high schools.
An examination of tho written
tests given to the entoring students
hi re last June and September shows
that there is a vast woilc yet to be
done before tho standard of prepar
atory English is satisfactory.
