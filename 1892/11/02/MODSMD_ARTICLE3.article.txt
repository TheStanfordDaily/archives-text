### 
The see*ond republican demonstra
tion in which our college republican
club has taken an active part oc
curred last night night at Mountain
View. About lit'ty btudents wearing
the blue mortar-boards and drab
coloreil gowns of the club left En
cina Hall in buses early in the even
ing, aud reached Mountain View in
due time to participate in the pro
ceeedings.
The parade started at Old Mount
ain View. Along the line of march
bonfires illuniinateel the surround
ing country, and the vigorous col
li go and republican yells given by
the boys greatly enlivened the pro
cession. At the Town llall of New
Mountain View tho march ended.
After speech making by prominent
republicans, and after the boys had
indulged in a sumptuous feast, the
hall was cleared, and dancing com
menced. A way in tho small hours
tho boys started for home, a tired
but satisfied lot.
