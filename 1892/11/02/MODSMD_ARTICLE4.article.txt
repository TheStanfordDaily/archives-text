# Football Practice.
## 
### 
The playing last night was some
what ragged. The first half was
played moderately fast, but the latter
part dragged. In respect to fast
playing, tho first eleven elo much
better than the second. The men
on the first eleven are very slow in
falling on the ball. By carelessness
in this work they allowed two touch
downs by the other side. The inter
ference does not improve much from
night to right. Too much individ
ual playing is displayed for the
amount of practice and coaching the
men have had. The captains were
vety slow in giving tho signals.
