A captain should be a man that
inspires confidence in his men, but
most, of all he should be a hustler.
An energetic fellow who is not
afraid of work, for in order to ex
pect hard work from his men he
should he a hard worker himself.
He must be an example to the rest
of the eleven, and after a team las
once elected him, they must obey
hint, but he must never bo over
bearing, having in his mind id, all
times, only (he interest and success
of flic leam. lie must treat his men
nil alike at all times. The student
body and the grand stand may have
their favorites, but the captain must
not. On the field ho may say
things that sound harsh and grate
against a player's pride, but Ik;
should remember that off or on the
field the captain is his best friend
and only has the success of the team
at heart.
Perfect order on the field is one
of the essentials to success, and the
football Held is no placc for conver
sation or gossip. A player who can
not keep his mouth shut, on the
football field, has no busiurss Here,
and the old maxim, that talkers are
never doers, applies to football
players as well as to anybody else.
Let the player who is always sug
gesting things remember, that those
who have studied and planned the
game, have their ideas as well an
himself. Strong competition for
po itions on the team is apt to en
gender hard feeling between play
ers; this should never be. The best
man will alwajs win, and ' scrap
ping" or slugging will not aid his
chances, for it is self e\ident thai
the man who turns his attention
simply to getting even with his man
v.ill necessarily neglect his game,
and the best football players are gen
erally those who can tako the most
punishment if necessary. llongli,
hard pi tying is desirable, but snap
ping and underhand playing, never.
The man who is unable to control
his temper, aud will slug under the
least provocation, will soon be
ruled off aud the team will be weak
ened ti mporarily. He must be a
gentleman on the field without be
ing gentlo.â€”Carl M. Jolianson.
