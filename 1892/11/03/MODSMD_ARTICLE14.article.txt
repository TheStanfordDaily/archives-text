Why not have the meeting of the;
Associated Students in the afternoon
at five o'clock, or better still, in the |
evening? The way the meetings are ;
held now, that is early in the after-1
noons, only a few students can
attend on account of laboratory and
simp work. The last week or two
there has been no meeting for lack
of a quorum, especially at lime when
important business was under con-,
federation. This should be remedied I
uiid the best way to do it in to have j
the meetings in the evening.
