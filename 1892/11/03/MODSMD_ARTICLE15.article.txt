Nkxt Saturday evening Dr. Kob
ert Noursc will lecture in the chapel
on "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde." He
has won quite a name throughout
the east and ought to draw a large
audience here. The J'ublir I'lutfurm
says of his lecture: "Perhaps Dr.
Nourse's best known lecture is 'I>r.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.' lie shows
that romance is a parable. Each of
us Ims Mr. Hyde and his possibil
ities in us, and if wo indulge him
soon, the Dr. Jekyll of our natures
will be driveu out, and Mr. Hyde
will rule supreme. It is a magnifi
cent topic. With consummate ait
Dr. Jekyll is pictured, and then
with more art, were that possible,
Mr. 1 lyde appears. So realistic, so
vivid, so frightfully intense is Dr.
Nourse's picture of Mr. Hyde, so
hideous is his inein,thatan audience
thrills with a nameless dread. It is
superb, unrivaled.
