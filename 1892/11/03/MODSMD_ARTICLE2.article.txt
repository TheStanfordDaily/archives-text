### 
Last night's practice was marke<l
by a mm]) ami vim greater than lias
be* n seen before on the football field
this year. Rapidity of play is begiu
inrr to show its effects on the men.
There is plenty of room however
for improvement of interference.
While the playing on the whole was
b:illiant last night, there were tim f, s

Avhcn Ihe men were a lil tie careless.
The men should follow the ball
closer. Lack of tliis was the cause
of ;it least two touch clowns. The
line men did better woik than any
night jet. The halves are slow in
getting started. These men lined up:
