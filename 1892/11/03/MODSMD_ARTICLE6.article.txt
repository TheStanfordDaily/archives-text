# Stagg on Baseball.

### 
In a recent interview Prof. A. A.
Stagg, of the Chicago University,
had tho following to say about base
ball:
"As to the decline of baseball in
tho list three years, and especially
in the last year, I am not a good au
; thorily. lam not well posted in the
league games. I know who is fir it,
and probably who is second, but 1
could not tell you who is third. 1
know there has boon a sreat, falling
| off in attendance, but 1 have no idea
that it is a permanent decline. The
j merits of baseball as a game are so
j great that it can never permanently
j drcline, nor ever cease to be the
American game. Still, 1 think foot
ball is a greater game, because in
playing it every man is engaged all
the time, and because it requires
I higher physical, mental, and moral
qualities than baseball. The phys
ical exertion is greater, tho danger is
I greater, calling for greater courage,
the exasperating collisions demand
ing greater good feeling, forbear
ance, and self control.
' Notwithstanding these points of
superiority of football over baseball,
the former will never supplant the
latter, because it can never be popu
lar with professionals. Football is
; already more popular among college
: students, but professionals dislike it
on account of the danger. •
"The opinion held by some people
| that amateur baseball playing is de
moralizing is unfounded, for nothing
| could furnish a more admirable train
ing oi' the physical powers, as well
| as some important mental qualities.
"As to professional playing, I must
admit that it leads to idleness and
vice. The game as professionally
played needs to be reformed. The
| desecration of the Sabbath ought to
be stopped. Then the sale of liq
uors ought to be prohibited. There
i ought to be a reformation, too, in
I the matter of training. Some men
I •
allow their teams to go on sprees in
; stead of attending to their work. If
these things were attended toast-hoy
should be, and as 1 think they will
be some day, 1 think professional
baseball as well as amateur baseball
would be a blessing."
