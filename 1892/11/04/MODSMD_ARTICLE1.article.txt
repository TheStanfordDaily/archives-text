Certainly the largest audience our
chapel lias ever held, poured in at
its doors last night, drawn by the
announcement of a loeture to be
given by the well-lcuown poet of the
Sierras, Joaquin Mr. ISI il
ler has chosen the grand, wild
scenery of our Pacific states as the
main theme of his poetry, and lie
himself lives in a picturesque home
near Oakland, which ho takes great
pleasure in cultivating and beauti
fying.
The entrance of Senator and Mis.
Stanford into the chapel was greet
ed with enthusiasm, and before the
address, in response to a request
from Mrs. Stanford, the students
all joined t golkcr in a couple of
well-known college songs, which
certainly put the audience into a
very merry humor.
Though Mr. Miller's subject was
"How to Tight," ho dealt mainly
with tl o question how to keep
peace. He showed how in order to
conquer and commaud, one must
lirst learn to obey, and obey not
only the letter of tho law, but the
spirit. One great way to avoid
strife was to seek always for beauty.
It would be found very near relig
ion. Indeed there is more beauty
in this world than anyone can ever
comprehend. lie spoke of the old
time chivalry, adding that, more
chivalry and courtesy lio in the
spirit of modern times than in any
of the romantic deeds of former
Hgc s.
Numerous anecdotes and stories
of life at other colleges interspereed
his discourse and he recited to us
two of his own poems, the senti
ment of ono of which was express
ivo of the generosity and benifi
cence of a great man and was really
a very delicate compliment to Sen
ator Stanford.
What perhaps touched us most
nearly of all was his plea for unity
and friendship a'nongdt the stu
dents and loyalty to the great Uni
versity back of us all. He dwelt
particularly on the love ono should
feel for his alma mater, and gave a
high tribute of praise to the beauty
of our own institution, which he
characterized as a poem in stone
it must have been an unnpprecia
tivo person, indeed, who could not
realize the truth of these words, on
going from the lecture room out
into the still moonlight that touch- 1
ed the low tiled roofs and broad
palms and poured through the
shadowy arches into tho long ar
cades.
