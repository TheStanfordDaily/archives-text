# The 						College Boy Begins Again.
## 
### 
The college boy—more acceptably
designated the college man—is back
once more at the institutions of
learning, and the journals of con
temporary life have resumed the
record of his achievements. The
most important news about him
just now is the recurring announce
ment of more or less serious damage
sustained by his members in football
matches.
Already ho hr.s so far educated the
public taste that nobody but old
fogies say that ho wastes his time
when he chases a leather bag around
a meadow, or that he could put hid
limbs to any bettor use than to en
tangle them with the limb . of any

got to be done, and to feel that even
if it does put her boy on crutches or
or in splints it is a dulcet and as de
corous as any other heroic perform
ance that is done for one's country.
It is a very great work that the
college boy is doiug for this dollar
chasing land; and what helps to
make it a permanent work is that,
like all tho great pedagogues, he
learns thoroughly the lesson that he
tcaches. Ho remembers it after he
has got out of colleg3 and melted
into tl.e general population, and
when his successor comes around to
continue the work that he is doing
now ho will take his seat among the
learners on the benches and lead the
applause. So it may be that we may
be able to worry along without any
real leisure class at all, aud stilt
suffer no detriment, thanks to the
college hoy and his devotion to our
good. It would be better that way
on some accounts—on this account
for one, that it is so much pleas
anter and easier to learn the lessons
of youth from the young.—Harper's
Weekly.
