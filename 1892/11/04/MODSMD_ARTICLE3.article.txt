# The
						Sunday School.

### 
The reason that the report of the
Sunday school which was organized
last Sunday was deferred till to-day
was in order t! at, a more definite ac
count of the plans could be pub
lished. Fro ft sjor Griffin was chosen
temporary chairman, and a nomina
ting committee consisting of Paris,
Stearns, and Miss All tbach was ap
pointed to report nominations of
permanent cflictr,-. Their report
was submitted and adopted as fol
lows: Superintendent, Professor F.
0. Clark; Assistants, Miss Cory and
\V. B. Moulton; Secretary, Miss
Martin; Treasurer, T. It. Warren.
These officers are to form the execu
tive conin.ittte which has general su
pervision of the school. During the
week classes were formed by the
committee. To provide for the chil
dren cf the professors, juvenile and
infant classes were formed. Besides
these, there wero suggested several
classes whoso work will be more def-;
initely defined later. Mr. Batehel-;
d< r has the management of a class in
Christian evid uice, which will ptvb- j
ably bo conducted by Professor
Show. Profissor Walter Miller will
take charge of a class in New Testa
ment , (!veÂ«k. Mr. W. O. B'ack will
conduct a class, tho work of which
will be announced liter. It will
probably be J'.ib!e analysis. A Bible
class intended for professors and
their wives is forme d, and it will ex
elude all students. It will follow no
definite plan, but its work will bo

determined by iU members. Skill
ing and Warren are to have charge
of a class composed of workmen at
the camp. Classes are proposed to
study the life of Christ, women of
the Bible, international lessons, and
the life of Paul and minor prophets.
The work thus outlined will be
modified largely by tho members of
the clashes as they enter. The work
outlined will be very interesting and
and is expected that large numbers
will assist iu making it so. The
study of the Bible is becoming more
and more prominent in the different
universities, as is seen by the promi
nence given to Sunday school work
in eastern universities. The work
here as elsewhere will depend largely
upon the interest taken in it by tho
the individual studeuts.
