# Football Letter.
## 
### 
Mr. 11. L. Porter, of San Mateo,
who gave such valuable assistance
to our eleven last year, has made
the Daily Palo -Vlto quite a hand
some offer. Ho has offered to write
a series of letters on tho subject of
football, first treating of the game
in general, then describing more par
ticularly the plays of the team and
the work of individaul playeis. The
letters will be of great value not
only to tho team, giving them many
valuable suggestions, but also to
those who know less of the game
and ought to know more. Mr. Por
ter is an old football enthusiast, lio
foio entering college he played the
game on the Princeton Preparatory
School eleven and was considered a
very promising player. Piinceton
made efforts to have him enter that
college but he entered Lehigh. Dur
ing the four yens course there he
distinguished himself and was a well
known player. While playing he J
encountered cn tho field all of the
large college teams, thus becoming !
acquainted with tho most celebrated
players and also with their most
skillful playing.
Mr. Porter is now teaching phys
ics and chemistry at St. Mathews
Hall at San Mateo. During our first
efforts last year he showed great in- .
terest in us, and our success can be
largely attributed to him.
Mr. Porler is an enthusiastic ath-!
lete and one who has ideals in
athletics. If i* his desire to see our
athletes grow up unmarred by any
trails of professionalism or rowdy
ism.
An invitation to take pait in the

The new stone station at Palo Al

Tho ein charge of the morning
chapel exercises would like to request
those who attend to sit closer to the
organ.
At the '90 meeting this afternoon
it was decided to postpone the class
reception, which was to have been
held in lloble to-morrow night, until
a week from to-morrow night, on ac
count of the contlict with the foot

One hundred and seventy students

Belle Dickie, daughter of George W.

daughter of Philip Lilienthal.
There were between live hundred
and eighty and six Lundrcd people
in the chapel last night. One hun
dred and forty persons were com
pelled to stand. Even the window
sills were used as seats.
When the temporary chapel will
not hold ad the students that wish
to attend an evening lecture, and
when it has to be used as a class
room, it seems about time t> begin
work on the Memorial Chapel, the
completion of which all the students
are looking forward to eagerly.
