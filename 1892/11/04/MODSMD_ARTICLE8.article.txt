Cross-country runs have ceased
f<r some reason. May be it is tie
absence of some enthusiast to lead
them, since a few of those who
would have taken part in afternoon
runs have gone into training lor the
football team and have begun to run
with the squad at 10 o'clock at
night. The large number of students
who are not trainiug and who really
need such exercisc are not encour
aged to take it. Nearly everyone is!
free between four o'clock and six,
and that is the very best time fora i
cross country run. Then the woik
of a day is over; it is a recreation to
go out and take a slow run return- J
ing fora lef'resbing bath and a vig
orous nibbing bofore dinner time. J
The run at 10 o'clock begins before j
most men have finished tLeir stud
ies, and it is taken in the crisp
night air which is rather too cold j
lor a runner to take into his lungs
in large quantities. Let us see our
men who have been confined to the
recitation rooms or the laboratories
nearly all day, and who got little or
no real exercise, come out every af
ternoon fora short run across the
fields. No elaborate costumo is re
quired. The expense is nothing,
and the exhilerating after effects are
groat.
