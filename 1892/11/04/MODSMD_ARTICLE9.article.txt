Last year the Pulo Alto wheel
men organized with about twenty
members, and got uniforms. "Where

We have many bicyclists among us;
more than double the number of
last year. Not a week passes
without a now wheel being added to
the number already on the campus.
This long, level valley with its good
loads and its pleasant weather, is
particularly fitted for the home of a
cycling club. And tliis university,'
situated aw it is at some distance j
from a city, whose attractions draw
students to it 011 every holiday, is
the ideal crlitre of such a club,
whose holidays could bo in
many pleasant runs tu points of in
terest in tlio surrounding country,
to neighboring towns, and even to
the larger cities. From here to San
.Joso is a pleasant eighteen-mile
lide, and from lure into fe'an Fran
cisco is a ri'le of about thirty-live
miles over a good, level road. To
the base of M t. Hamilton would bo ;
a pleasant, level run, while a little
more difficult, but. probably morel
interesting, would be a trip over the
low mountains to the coast. On
several occasions some of our bicy
clists have distinguished themselves ,

on the race track. They are not the
only men among us, though, that
are able to develop speed Oilierj
men here have just as good a chance
as these few have had. All they
need is a stimulus, such as that
which would be given by the action
of a good ell'ective organization
which would see that its individual
members received every encourage
ment to develop their best qualities
on the wheel. It is not so pleasant j
to ride alone as it is to ride in com
pany, and it is far more pleasant to <
the college man if the company be
his fellow students and they be
dressed in a particular uniform
which will distinguish them as col
• I
lege students. An cfhctivo organi
zation can accomplish much in col
lege life. Without an organization
all athletic interest languishes' or
only occasionly is agitated by some
cronic growler who generally finds
fault with the very things that his
complaining will never improve,
while his energies, if exerted in the
proper direction —the cause of the;
lack of interest, the absence of
thorough organization —might avail
much towards putting things in
working order. We have this to
pay to the Stanford bicyclists. II
you ever hopo to have a bicycle
track here where your splendid ma
terial can develop speed and make
records; organize. Maintain the in
tereet of your members in the or- j
gamzation by frequent runs to dif
ferent points of interest, and con
stantly woik for the advancement of
cycling interests in the university.
Show outsiders that you are entliu- j
siastic, that you mean business, and
you will receive their support
when you want a track built.
