The Faris Railroad Bill in its
amended form occupied the atten

evening. After being eulogized or
crticised, endorsed or condemned,
according to the individual beliefs
and political preference of the
speaker, the bill was finally passed
by the house, and upon receiving
the sanction of President Clark, will
become the law of the land.
After the bill was reported by the
committee the House went into com
mittee of the whole for its consider
ation, Representative Zion Ring
called to the chair by tho speaker.
The deb.de was opened by Repre

mental control He vvas followed by
Speaker Gruwell who pointed out
certain evils which Buch a course
must inevitably aggravate Other
speakers were Bepresentatives
Hughes, Johnson, R >se, Hidden,
anil Wig!e, the latter d( aling in an
able manner with the financial and
economic phases of tho question.
The committee then rose and the
