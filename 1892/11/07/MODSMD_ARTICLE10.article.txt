The game of last Saturday made
(vident many of our weak points.
Tlie Xsakland team surely
played well, but the display between
the respective weight and ability of
the two teams was too great for us
to be satisfied with such a ]>oor
score. There is still the same
fault. Our team plays too slow and
interferes too poorly. It is about
time that we should look forward to
the game with Heikeley. They are
working hard and mean to win this
year if there is any possibility to do
so. In their game with the Olymp
ics Saturday they showe I wonder
ful results with ono week's practice.
Henry has becu added to their team
and Foulks will probably follow.
There is no reason why wo should
confident now. Jones will j rob
ably not play again this year.
Downing and (Jlemans are both on
crutches and will probably b 1 so for
tvo weeks. This throws all the
backs oil' from the team for some
time.
