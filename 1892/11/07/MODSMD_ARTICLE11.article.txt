The Stanford Republicans, and
particularly those who were pres
ent at the meeting of the League of
College Rej u 1Â»1 xin Clubs in Pio
neer hall, Sau Fiancisco, Saturday
night, do not let 1 that Stanford was
given anything like a decent men
tion in the C/u-oiiirfr write up Hun

copious noteI',1', the Stanford speaker,
Charles H. llogg, president of our
club, received scarcely any notice,
except the fact that "he read an e.s
tay which bore mainly upon the
history and principle* of the Re
publican party," while the truth is,
he delivered a fifteen miuutes'
speech, not a woid of which was
wiitlen. Stanford Republicans
bear no ill will to the reporters, who
for some personal motive may have
seen tit to glorify Bcikeley to the
exclusion of Stanford.
