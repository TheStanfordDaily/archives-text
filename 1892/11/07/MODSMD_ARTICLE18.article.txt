# The 						Olympia Launched.
## 
### 
A party of about 170 from the Un
iversity went (o Sim Francisco on
Saturday to sco the launching of the
crusier "Olympia" at the shipyards
of the Union Iron Works. Inviti
tions had been kindly sent by Mr.
U. SV. .1 )ickie, manager of the works.
A band and colored bunting in
dicated to those appro sching that ii
was a holiday at the works, and
th ongs of people were gathering
from all directions. We found the
workmen splitting out the last of
the supports, leaving the great ves
sel with her wonderfully graceful
outlines revealed, and resting only
on a cradle of timbers, which in
turn rested on a well-lubricated way.
From the raised platform at the
vessel's bow, where Miss Dickie
christonul her, to the stem where
remained the la^tobstac'e, there ran
an elect'ic wire. At exactly 11:25
Miss Lillienthul touched an el.ctric
button, the last obstacle dropped, af
ter a breathless instant the thrill of
life ran along the great keel, and
slowly with the dignity befitting her
s'zo and beauty, and amid a tumult
of steam whittles and a tumult of
human voices, the "Olympia ' slid
int.-) the waters of the bay.
There is something inexpressibly
majestic and impressive in the
launching of a great ship, and he who
can si e it, unmoved must have a soul
o! prose. Even the "poets who only
listen" must surely leel at such a
time a tendency to sing.
