# Sunday Morning Service.
## 
### 
Dr. Nour.se conducted the Sunday
morning service in the chapel, and
his sermon, in the opinion of a large
number, was the best that has been
heard this semester. The text was
from the fourteenth chapter, third
verse, of St. Mark, and the lesson
which Dr. Nomse learned from it,
and which he wished to be learned
wits: "Be kind to the living. ISpeak
well of people, and carry your tokens
of a flection to them while they are
alive. Do uot wait until they are
dead, for then kind words and sweet
flowers can do no good."
