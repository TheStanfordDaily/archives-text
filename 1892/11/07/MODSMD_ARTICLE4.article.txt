TL( lissult >i -Saturday's game
was mortifying iu tin- extreme t;»
itli S aufovd supporters. The men
individually were iu earnest and
worked hard but there was a com
plete demoralization of team work
that does not argue well for the fu
ture. Oakland's defensive work was
stronger than Stanford's, their ag
gressive play more elective, their
tackliug quicker and harder, and
their team work infinitely better.
Stanford in reality did nothing but
make short rmhea through the line
When a run was attempted around
the end, the int. rfttring was simply
intolerable. The loose work of the
backs and the unsatisfactory sup
port of the rush line must bo rem
edied in short order or the team will
reali/.e a most humiliating defeat at
the hands of Berkeley.
Itansome won the toss and took
the ball iu the north goal. They
made 10 yards on a V. Wychoff
fumbles the bull. Uansome kicks to
Jones but, Stnnfonl loses the bill
immediately on a fumble. lSoth sides
buck the line for small gains until
hunt makes a run around right eul
for 15 yards. Sherman and Collier
make some brilliant tackles. Oak
land gets •"> yards on Walton's foul
ing of Sherman. Jones is hurt at
this siage of the game. Lunt goes
back to full and Wilson takes h'rank
enheimcr'e place on end, l'Vanken
heimer going in as right half, llan
some goes arouud the end on the
third down but fails to gain. Stan
ford gets the ball and by rushing the
line pushes Oakland down on their

own g iiil unlit Lunt carries the ball
over for the first touch-down. < 'ode
punts out to Wilson and fails io
kick goal on a difficult try. Score
4 to 0.
Oakland now rushes the ball close
to Stanford's goal by continual
small gains around the end and
through the center. Oa one of
lUnsorite's runs around the left end
ho would evidently have made a
touch down had it not been for the
ditch across the south goal line.
Uansonie tns to make a field kick
but the ball is fumbled and .Frank-!
enheimer makes a seventy-five yard
inn u]) the field before he is downed
by Sherman. First half is up with
the score only -1 to U in favor of
Stanford.
The second half opened with much
more quickness and sn p on Stan
foul's part but with a dtcided lack
of team work Stanford forced the
ball down on Oakland's goal by
sending Frankenbeirnov <• iln.

r.o -a nc tactics of bucking the
! center. Walton makes one inn
around the end lor ten yards.
The two teams alternate in gains and
losses, Itansome makes some fine

' for Ransome; o.Downing stojis Kan

down Oakland's territory until Frank
