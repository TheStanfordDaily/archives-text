The garuo last Satin<l .yin Central
! Park, San Francisco, resulted in a
victory for the U. 0. team; score,
1G to 0. The Herlii'lc.y team : ho wed
I very clearly that th<v are playing
! seriously this year. The defei's of
last year have aroused tliem, and
I whatever team defeats then this
I year will do so by hard playiuy.

Their team work was most excellent.
Every man knew liis play as soon as
the signal was given. The blocking
was the best ever done by them.
Walter Henry is a tower of strength,
and bis presence on the team uotice
ably strengthened it. limit played
a better game than ever before. He
went through the center with a force
that was irresistible, lull back Tay
lor gave some (xce'.hnt exhibitions
of side punts. The Oh m} ics played
slowly. Too much time was lo>-t be
fore putting the ball into p'ay.
There were about three thousand
people on the grand stand, the ma
jority of whom were XJ. (J men and
their sympathizers.
