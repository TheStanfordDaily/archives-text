of the day, .ad it was
eouvaging to those who f*.«■ ■ desir us

In the preliminary round Camp
bell and Bannister easily defeated
Reynolds ami Soper, score <i-J, 0-1.
Smith and Potter beat Kofz 1 and
Magee, 0-2, 0 3; bath teams played
very poorly and the result was only
a question as to which played the
poorer.
In the first round Campbell and
Bannister defeated Chase ami Bab
cock, S) 7, [\ 0, 04. Cochrnn nnd
partner defaulted to Smith and Pot
ter, leaving this team and Camp
bell aud Bannister in the fi
