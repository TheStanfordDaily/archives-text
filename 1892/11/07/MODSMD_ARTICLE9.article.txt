It has been suggested several
times that a word ought to be said
about the applause which is used in
the chapel on the occasion of a
public lecture or entertainment cf
any sort. Someone introduced at
the close of last year the idea of
clapping tho hands in the cadence
in which tho Stanford yell is given.
It is to be questioned whether
the idea is a good one. The clap
ping in the cadence suggested the
more noisy applause of stamping
the feet with a similar cadence. The
habit of stamping the ieet is con
sidered very poor taste. The stamp
ing of feet in the manner suggested
above is worse than ] oor taste. It
is too suggestive of the gallery gods
at a minstrel show, who show their
impatience by stamping and their
approval by whistling. Many of
our public speakers do not under
stand that the applause which
sounds so similar to the gallery gods'
applause is simply our approbation
expressed iu a peculiar manner.
There is not enough of novelty in
this to entitle it to be kept up. It
sounds more like hoodlum applause
than our yell aud therefore ought to
be abolished.
