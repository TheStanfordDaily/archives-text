# FOOTBALL LETTERS
## The
						First of Mr. R.L. Porter's Articles on the Great Game. 
### 
Written for tin' Daily Palo A/lu.
| It was announced in last Friday's
paper that Mr. R. L. Porter had
kindly offered to write a series of
articles on the subject of football for
the Daii.y Palo Alto. To-day we
publish the first of these letters. |
The courage and enthusiasm which
the Stanford boys have shown in
their football work augurs well for
the future of their Alma Mater.
Men who have perseverence enough
to organize and perfect under such
disadvantages so good a football
team as the one which tirst wore the
L. S. Jr. IT. colors are not the ones
to ever let the spirit and standard of
their University sink
We o;i the outride who admire
pluck and perseverance were pleas
antly surprised when our first endeav
or planted your banner above the
blue .id<l gold of Berkeley, and it is
our hope that your efforts may be as
successful this year a^las^.
Stanford has not one mission, but
many; those that pertain to the fields
of education have been elucidated
many times. I would tell you of
your mission for the benefit of true
amateur sport and the placing of
western college athletics on a high,
pure plane, by sturdily maintain
ing entire independence from any
professionalism, and ever endeav
oring to improve the sports under
)our control. Your influence in
football was immediately noticeable
Last year's game of your team was a
revelation to tho old football players
of the coast. And the improvement
in tin* U. of C.'s game this year was
the direct result of theis very bittei
lesson of last Febiuary. Flight here
let me say that it will be wise for the
Stanford team not to become victims
of over confidence. It is true that the
I', of C.'s game of last Saturday was
wretchedly poor, but it is not the
best they can do by any means, and
it is not impossible that the this
year's over confident, leam may meet
witli as great a set back as the over
confident one of last year.
I purpose through tho loudness of
the editors of the Palo Alto to
write a series of letters treating of
football. Beginning with tho hand
ling of a team the letters will treat
of each position in turn. No doubt
much that is written will be old to
the readers but the axioms ol the
game tutu not be read too often
To tackle low, to tackle hard, and
to follow the ball at all times and in
all places are the three truths that
must be mastered,and to a good foot

ballist tho greatest of these is to
tackle low. Shnn the high tackle,
for as long as you tackle high, re
member, yon are no football player.
To some low tackling is a natural
gift, to others it is the result of long* 1
and hard work. If you are not a
natural tackier, practice! practice!
Following the ball will come to the
most without much thought and
those to whom it docs not come
easily may he sure that nnture did
not mark them with the A1 football
brand.
In the next issue I will endeavor
to }:ive my idea of captaining a team
and football strategy.
R. L. Porter.
