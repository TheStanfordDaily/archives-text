The Review of licvincf for Novem
ber contains the following highly
complimentary review of L)r. Elliott's
"Tatiir Controversy in the United
States, 1789 18:13" :
"The first publication which has
come to us from the press of the new
Leland Stanford Junior University,
California, is a worthy and timely
contribution to its department of
knowledge. O. L. Elliott, Ph. I).,
gives in this monograph what would
seem to us, upon somewhat hasty |
examination, to be the most thorough
atd impartial review that has yet I
been made of the history of the tatil'f
question in the United States up to
the year 1833. There is an intro- j
ductory essay upon the tariff systems
of the colonial period, a valuable
chapter upon the tariff of 1781), and j
Hamilton's report on manufactures,
with full reviews of the course of our
tatift'history and discussion up to
the time of Jackson's administration
and Calhoun's nullification, which,!
as a special concluding, topic, is
treated with great ability by Dr. j
Elliott. The Leland Stanford Jun
ior University is to be congratulated !
upon the character and appearance
of the initial volume in its proposed
series of scientific publications."
