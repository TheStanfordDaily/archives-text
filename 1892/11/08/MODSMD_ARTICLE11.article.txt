The International Monetary Con
ference of the United States and t.lio j
different countries of Enropo, to
which conference President An
drews will go as a delegate, l as
been cal'ed to meet at Brussels,
Belgium, November 22d. The
conffronne v/ill have befuic it Ihoi
important problem of fixing a per
manent ratio between gold and:
silver as monetary metals.
The legal ratios now existing in j

the Nation?! countries uro as follows:
Mexico, 1 to Hi 5; Japan, 1 to 10.8;
United States of America, L to
15 i) 88; F ranee, Belgium, Switzer
land, Italy, Greece, Spain, Nothir
lands, Bussia, Central American
States, South American Bepublic,
Brnzil excepted, and Haiti, 1 to 15 5;
Austro Hungary, 1 to 15.3; British
India, Ito 15. It, is plan that the
now international ratio to be adopt
ed will differ from some of the now
existing ratios, and that in some of
the countrios recoinage will bo nec
essary.
Authorities believe it to be the
most natural and practical thing to
adopt as the permanent internation
al ratio that is now existing in
British India, established b}' Eng
land, namely 1 to 15, one ounce of
pure gold equal to fifteen ounces of
pure silver. The United States
would, by this ariangemeni, return
to her old ratio of 1 to 15 that ex
isted in 1793.
A consideration of the foregoing
facts suggests tho great importance
of this conference. It will be com
posed of tlio most eminent political
economists of all the countries rep
resented, and will no doubt have the
effect of simplifying tho hitherto
complicated question of monetary
