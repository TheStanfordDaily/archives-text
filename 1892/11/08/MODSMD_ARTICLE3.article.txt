						Passion Play.
## 
### 
To-morrow evening Dr. Jordan
will deliver a lecture on the Pas-ion
Play. This will probably bo the
most, interesting lecture of the sem
ester, inasmuch as Dr. Â»Jordan has,
while abroad, given considerable
time and attention to the study of
the play. He has provided for illus
trating the lecture by the use of forty
magic lantern slides which he has
prepared. It, is expected that a
large number of people from May
fiekl and Palo Alto will attend.
