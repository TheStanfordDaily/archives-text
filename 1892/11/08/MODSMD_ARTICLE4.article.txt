# Election Returns.
## 
### 
The local telegraph office here will
receive all the election returns from
headquarters to-night as the bulletins
are issued. As the wires will be
crowded, the bulletins will be given
preference over all other matters.
There may he returns during the
afternoon, but the regular issue will
not begin till about six o'clock. The
republican and democratic clubs
here are making provisions for pub
lishing the returns as soon as they
are received. The republicans will
have the use of room 50 of the quad
rangle, the democrats will have room
62, and the professors will have the
President's Office.
