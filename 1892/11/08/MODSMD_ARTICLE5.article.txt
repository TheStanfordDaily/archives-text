ceived a telegram frora Manager
Walter S. Bran "from Berkeley ask
ing if our team expected to play this
December. Manager Champlin
was unable to reply to the telegram
as the exnct date in December is a
matter of great consequence. This
morning Mr. Bran wrote to our
mau.iger as follows:
' For some time 1 have been en
deavoring to liutl out whether you
intend to play us football this De
cember, but thus far all my efforts
have been fruitless. It seems that
the only way to get a game with
you is to lormully challenge yon.
Enclosed you will find a formal
challenge to which 1 hope you will
reply at once; for if we are not going
to get, a game with Palo Alio, 1
want to know it that I may make
some arrangements for other games
with outside clubs. Trusting that
1 shall roodvo an immediate reply,
1 remain, Sincerely yours,
"Walter S. Bran."
The enclosed challenge is as fol
lows:
To the L. S. Jr. U. Football Team,
Geo. Champlin, Manager:â€”The
University of California football
team hereby challenge the belaud
Stanford Jr. University football team
to a match game to be played in
San Francisco, not later than Dec.
10, 1802. Walter S. Bran,
Manager of V. 0. Football Team.
Mr. Champlin replied to the let
ter substantially as follows: That a
matter of playing a game of this
kind is of importance and ought not
to be too hastily considered. As
regards the formal challenge he ac
cepted it in part, objecting to the
clause which set the dale of game,
saying that it is customary in giv
ing challenges to allow the parties
challenged the privilege of select
ing the date and place of contest, j

If the 11. C. manager can conform to
usage in the matter of selecting the
date ami the date satisfactorily ar
ranged. matters of detail will bo
settled in the near future.
It has been detiuitely settled that
our team will play the Los Angeles
Athletic Club team on Christmas
Day in Los Angles. The eleven
will start from here on Dec 22d, ar
riving there on the following day.
