# Art of Expression

### 
Mr. Russell's lecture was attended
by a rather small audience last even
ing. Before commencing, he re
quested the audience to move up
front, remarking that it was easier
to talk to people than empty seats.
This lecture, which was the first of
a course of lectures to bo given by
Mr. Kussidl, was on the "Art of Ex
predion." First, he spoke biielly
about our three natures, physical,
moral, and mental, showing the
proper means of expressing each,
lie then proceeded to the voice.
This proved an interesting subject.
This subject of the voice is divided
into three parts, the tone (common
to both man and brute), the spoken
word, and the phrasing of words.
Mr. Russell spoke at length upon
the articulation of the vowel and
consonant sounds of the language.
He said that it is the usual thing
fora vocal teacher to drill a begin
ner upon the sound a, which pro
ceeds from the throat, winners the
finest teacher in Talis drills his pu
pils upon the two sounds o and 00,
which are made with the lips. From
the sounds made by the mouth, Mr.
llnssell naturally proceeded to the
mouth itself, and some very inter
esting facts were learned concern
ing it, one fact being that in a weak
minded, sickly, 01 peevish person
the under lip always drops down.
Dclsarte taught that the word, tone,
and gesture underlie whatever man
has to sny The word nnd tone hav
ing been treated of, Mr. Russell
next took up the subject of gesture.
Several statements made in the (irst
part of the lecture concerning the
arm were repeted, and then fol
lowed an interesting description of
gestures and handshaking. Mr.
Russell being at a loss for some one
with whom to shake hands for the
sake of illustration, one from the
audicncc rather reluetant'y itopppd
forward to help him out ; and then
quite an interesting exhibition fol
lowed. This ended the lecturc.
