By seven o'clock last night quite a
number of excited democrats and
republicans had gathered in the
quadrangle, anxiously awaiting] the
election returns. The democrats
were in room 152, and the republicans
in room 50, while the members of
the faculty ni"t in the registrar's of
fice. Soon the returns from New
York city I egan to come in, and il
speedily became evident that a small
number of democrats could really
make a great deal of noise. Parades
around the quadrangle to the tune,
"Grover! Grover! had a walk-over!''
were interspersed with brief visits to
the faculty, who were serenaded by n
full chorus of dulcet voices to the
tune of, "Cleveland and Stephenson!
Rah! 1 tali! Kali! Our next President!
Zip! Boom! All!' The students'
band arrived on the scene about half
past nine, and republicans and dem
ocrats joint'd in a grand parade
around the quad, and then over to
Hoble, Encina, and elsewhere. The
demonstrations continued until about
two o'clock, when the jubilant dem
ocrats and hopeful republicans re
tired for tko night.
