The football men Monday even
ing decided to start subscription
lists to raise money necessary fyr
carrying on tbe games. It is not
necessary to say that the money is
needed. The management hod to
borrow $20.00 to pay the Oakland
High School team's expenses, and
will have other expenses connect d
witU the Olympic games. It was
decided to ask the studeuts for
no definite amount, in order to give
nil an opportunity to give as they
are able. The Olympic game, were
it played as the Olympics desired,
would cost our men fifty cents be
sides railway fare. The manage
ment desired to have some good
football on our own grounds and
arranged to have the game here.
Everyone should therefore be wil
ling to pay at lea>t as much as the
free games would cost them were
entrance charged, and it is hoped
that those who can will pay more.
