It was announced some time:
ago that the Christian Associa
tion had appointed a committee to
secure Rome good concerts at the
University this winter. The com
mittee went to work in accordance
with their instructions and had
about made an engagement with
Miss Stevens to give a recital when i
it was ascertained that this would
interfere with the football benefit
As Miss Stevens was going east al
most, immediately, the concert was;
postponed indefinitely. Meantime
the committeo were also correspond
ing with Mr. Sigmund Keel, when
they learned that he had been se
cured privately by Mr. Edward;
Hulme to give a concert here in
November. The commit'.ee have |
therefore withdrawn for the pres-j
ent in Mr. Hulme's favor. It is
hoped that the guarantee list which
was begun by them will be trans
ferred to Mr. Hulme, since upon the
patronage which this concert re
ceives depends whether any more j
such concerts will be undertaken
this winter.
