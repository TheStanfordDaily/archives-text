The democratic students met this
afternoon and decided to have a cel
ebration Friday night, probably in
the chapel, over Cleveland's election,
Professor Howard will be asked to
deliver the principal spcech of the
evening. Committees were ap
pointed to secure fire-works, a band,
and torches for the occasion. The
uniforms of the democratic club of
San .lose probably will be borrowed
for that evening. Many young ladies
were at the meeting.
