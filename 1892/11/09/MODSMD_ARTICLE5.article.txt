# The 						World's Fair Guides.
## 
### 
The World's Fair will need from
1200 to 1500 guides. They will
ho chosen from very advanced stud
ents, who are in tome measure
specialists, and therefore able, after a
few weeks preliminary training, to
explain accurately and intelligently
the sections of the fair to which they
are assigned. Many of the visitors
will attend with the express idea of
studying certain features of the fair.
For this reason great care will be.
exercised by the university faculties
in the choice of guides, and it will
be useless for any but tho most ad
vanced students to apply.
The compensation will be some
what more than enough to pay living
expenses. A large number of the
guides will be I dged in the dormi
tories of the University of Chicago.
No more than five hours daily, it is
now thought, will be required of the
guide s, and this fora period of about
three months. A training school
for the guides will be opened three
or four weeks in advance of the fair,
and the guides will hava to attend in
order to become familiar with their
respective sections. So many more
guides will be needed than was at
first expected that the I- uiversity of
Chicago will undertake simply to
recommend, rather than to engage
them. The University of Chicago
will probably atk one or two other
large institutions besides the Uni
versity of Wisconsin to aid in fur
nishing guides, and it is believed
that every student who desires, and
who is sufficiently advanced to have
acquired more than a superficial
knowledge of some subject or sub
jeets, will liud congenial employ
ment. The matter will bo finally de
cided in a month or two, when a
proper notice of the same will be
given, and applications received.
Meanwhile no applications will be
received, and no further information
can be by any member of the
university faculty.â€”Daily Cardinal.
