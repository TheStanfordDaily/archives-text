# Geological Club.

The Geo'ogical Club held its
regular meetiug Monday evening in
the geological labratory.
The announced talk on German
universities was postponed, as the
recent geological trips have been
productive of very interesting re
sults, and it was thought best to de
vote the evening to their consider
ation.
Dr. Smith gave a resume of the
fossils collected, with their bearing
on the ago of the strata. Of special
interest among the many interest
ing fossils shown was an Ancellus
of the same species that has been
found in Russia, Alaska, Now Zeal
and and India, a genus that is con
lined to a single narrow horizon and
represented by but a single species.
Mr. Means then gave what had
been learned of the stratigraphy and
age of the Coast Range, especially
calling attention to a case showing
in the bluff* at Puiissima of recont
strata lying horizontally on the up
turned edges of older strata.
It was decided to change the
night of meeting to Friday, the
next meeting to be a week from
next Friday.
