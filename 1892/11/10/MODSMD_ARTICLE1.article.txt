# WALTER CAMP.
## Yale's Great Coach to Come to Palo Alto. The
						Famous Football Player and Coach Telegraphs an Offer to Take Charge of Our Eleven till the Game with Berkeley. 
### 
Just as we are going to press
word is received saying we may pub
lisli the news that Walter Cau.p will
cooie to Palo Alto to coach our
eleven. Despite the vigilance and
secrecy of tlio football arrangement,
it became known to the staff that tel
egrams were Hying back and forth
between Stanford University and
Yale. These telegrams were full of
importance, and we were fairly
weighted down under the important
secret and the desire to publish it
'J ho football men were firm, and
would under no conditions allow
the news to be published till each a
day as it had become settled.
Mr. Cliainpliii telegraphed to
Walter (lamp about a week ago ask
ing him to recommend to us a good,
available football coach. The reply
was to the t ll'.ct that all coaches
were employed, and would be f-o till
Thanksgiving day. More telegrams
followed, and then Mr. Camp pro
poned to us that in ca?e we could get
no other coach up to Thanksgiving
day he himself wou'd come to us.
His terms were sent for, and the
proposition was accepted this morn
ing.
.No one who is up on the great
gime needs to bo informed who
Walter (lamp is. The mere mention
of his name to a footbill man is suf
lieu ut to awaken football enthusiasm.
To those who are not so familiar
with the great heio of college ath
letics, we give a few items concern
ing our conrh,
Walter Camp entered Yale with
the clas? of '81, and at once became
one of the best players on the great
Vale eleven. He played during his
four college years and three 3 ears of
his professional course, becoming
recognized early in his course as one
of the best informed and most skill
ful players on the team. Since his
graduation he has lived in New
Haven, and has closely watched the
interests, both athletic and social, ol
his alma mater. He has kept abreast
of the most advanced football and
other athletic int< rt sts of American
colleges. Both Yale men and men
iioui other colleges lOcwgiu/.u thai lu
his wise counsel and energetic work
011 the held is Vale's success largely
due.

From the beginning of the Reason
Mr. Camp lias been coaching the
Yale team. lie will remain with
that team till Nov. 2l>d, when he will
come to Palo Alto. When he ar
rives the team will be in line train
ing. and he will at onco begin to di
rect the team woik. Enthusiasm is
going up to a white heat. This
morning a subscription list was
started among the students, and in
less than two hours time $275 was
pledged. This was from fifty five,
who pledged $"> api. ee. On the day
of the championship game we expect
to sc-o enthusiasm that will throw
hist year's in the shade.
