The following is extracted from .
pi rsonal letter from an active mem
-1) rof the Yule foo bull team. It
contains facts boiled clown and in
authentic from beginning to end.
It is worth whole columns of Hub
club and gufi", and those interested
in football will got more informa
tior : y reading these few lines than
they could in any other way:
'■It will be impossible to fdl
Hefielfiuger's place, and the best
center Yale can send to Springfield
must be inexperienced, though it
may be strong. Ives will make a
good man, and if Stillman plays
centre, Sanford will play in Hell's

"The leal feeling here is that v r e
have got to work, and \ou may be
sure we are doing that. The prac

New ILuven again. But tho case

before. Harvard is strong, but will
she know how to use her strength?

am afraid, has the strength too, but
Yale will send a good team to rep
resent her, and may win."
