# The
						Passion Play.
## 
### 
The audience that gathered in the
chapel last evening was gratified by
of the finest lectures ever de
livered there. Just before his de
parture for the east, Dr. Jordan
has found opportunity for present
ing to us a most vivid description of
the great Passion Play of Obera
miuagau based on his personal
witnessing of it9 performance two
years ago. This Passion Play is
the last remnant that has co.-ne
down to us as a survival of those
quaint mystery plays which in
structed and delighted tbe people
of centuries ago. But the towns
folk who gathered in admiration at
those half humorous, half theolog
ical platform performances, with
their quarreling imps and declaim
ing disciples, would scarcely recog
nize as a myst<ry play this story
told in its noble, stately language,
and lacking the old time comic ele
ment.
In lfillO the little vil-'age of Obera
inmagau, nes led in the picturesque,
Bavarian Alps, was visited by a
plague —so severe that the inhab
itants vowed, that should it be
allayed, the Passion should be
played ever after in their village at
intervals of ten years; whereupon
the plague ceased. And so it comes
about that a bit of mediaeval cere
mony has been handed down to our
practical n'nete nth century.
The Oberammagau Passion Play
lias entirely freed itself from the
grotesqueness of i!s predecessors; it
is distinctively modern in its dra
matic bar mi ny and artistic local
color. It presents itself as a strong,
earnest story, to the realistic rep
resentation of which the life of the
community is devoted.
Some thirty or forty years ago it
was discovered by tourists,who spoke
so enthusiastically of it that over
ten thousand ptrsons attended the
last performances. It is given every
Sunday from May till October, and
sometimes on week days. We can
i imagine its effect anel interest when
we learn that it occupies some eight
hours in ac ing. The actors do not
play for money. It. is their life
! work to make a noble picture, and
they go about it with great sincerity
and earnestness. Everything is
real; no stage effects or spectacular
biilliancy. All systematical events
are avoideel and tl:e story of the
betrayal and crucifixion is present
ed to us as it might really have hap
pened two thousand years ago
Theology, dogma, didactic purpose
are all absent and tho play appeals
to us by its intrinsic truth and
! humanity.

The players are more than intra
actors. From childhood up they
have taken part; they seem to live
in their characters, not. lo act at all.
The heat are advanced in each imp
lementation, and the crowning posi
tions are the characters of Christ,
Judas, and Pontius Pilate. A chor
us, after the manner of the Greeks,
explains lhe action in the interludes.
Tableaux from the Old Testament
precede and have a significant rela
tion to each act.
After a dignified prologue the
play commences with Christ's entry
into Jerusalem. Joseph Mnyr, who
takes the part ol the Savior, has a
sad face, somewhat stronger than
Christ's is usually depicted, but
with a noble expression, as of one
who can affotd to be silent, This
artisan forgets himself in his part
and is so natural that one experi
ences no shock of irreverence such
as would be caused by the least
particle of affectation. The j l.iy fol
lows the liibical narrative very
closely, bringing out forcibly the
dramatic development. It is inter
esting to notice that the arrange
ment of scencry, etc. in the play is
based on many well-known religious
pictures, particularly those of
Albrecht Durer. A striking in
stance, also, is the List Supper of
Leonardo da Vinci.
Nothing in the play is strained;
all is simple and natural. This is
indeed the only thing that preserves
it—its absolute perfection. It will
last as long as the peasants remain
single and humble. In an}' other
place and other any other circum
stances it could not. exist at all.
The evening closed with lantern
views of some forty pictures pre
pared from instanianeous photo
graphs taken at one of the rehears
als, for no camera is allowed to in
terfere with tho religious signifi
cance. of ihe tragedy.
Dr. Jordan'could not have left
with us anything more impressive
and lasting than the memory of this
lecture to bridge over the period of
his absence from the Univeisity.
