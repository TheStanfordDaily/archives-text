Thus far the library has been prac
tically free from irregularities in the
way of surrept.iciously taking books
from the shelves and either tuking
them home or lending them. It has
not been entirely free, however, and
of late a disposition on the partot
one or two seems to predict the in
troduction of this custom, which is
very annoying to say the least.
There is no use to speak here of
the annoyance which such irregular
ities cause both students using these
books and the librarians who have
charge of them. Any one who would
do such a tiling as to take from the
library a volume which is in constant
nse would be beyond being moved
to a sense of his selfishness by any
thing which could be said in these
columns. A word might bo said,
however, to other students. No cue
ought to fed any compunctions
about giving information concerning
the whereabouts of a missing book.
Indeed it ought to be felt the duty
of everyone to give assistance in
helping to hunt out such miscreants.

Our chances on the football Held
are not so bright as they were sev
eral weeks ago. With three of our
backs injured and our team, as a
whole, playing the slow, indifferent
game they put up Saturday against
a team on which it was the duty of
our eleven to score at least forty
points to nothing, it is not strange
that many of the outside students
shake their heads sadly and look
doubtful when the Stanford-Olym
pic and Stanford-U. C. games are
mentioned. But we have confi
dence in the ability of our men, in
their pluck and determination. We
remember how last year a teim
which seemed insignificant indeed
in its ignorance of football, quickly
came to the front and downed any
thing it. met. But our past good
record is not going to win any
games foruÃŸ this year. Still, the
precedent that the pioneer Stanford
team established will help our men
along. It is almost settled that
Stanford and U. C. will meet about
l)rc. 17th. Every man in the team
has got to play football from now
hn. The students demand that the
men exert every effort to make this
year's eleven a worthy successor of

last year's victors; and they should
emphasize their demauds l>y hearty
encouragement of the football men
