<\>uick slatting is one of the most
effective things in football that any
team eun pursue to advantage as a
preliminary training. This import
ant I'aet. should not be lost sight of
until the very last game in the sched
ule has been played. There is not
one single element of a football
]>layer which counts for more in a
close game. J1 o should be able to
jump into the rush line as quick as
lightning after he receives the ball;
a second slow on the start will cause
him to loose instead of gain the rc
quired distance. The rusher or back
who is always on his mettle ready to
jump forward the instant the signal
is given, can be generally counted
upon to gain the necessary yard 01
yards at a critical moment. Any
time practiced on quick starting will
be an advantage not only to the backs,
but to the rushers. The rusher will
acquire that snap of quick action
thut will be oi so great benelit in go
ing through the line the very minute
the ball moves, and down the oppo
nent, in his own territory; the backs
•will lind it their best aid in gaining
the required distance, and such prac
tice cannot help but promote that
quick action which is of so great value
in a football player. Another thing
which should not be forgottn in con

nection with starting is the practice
of getting through the line Ihe very
instant the ball starts back; this
should be practiced with such per
sistency throughout the season that
who 11 your team gets iuto a game
where the rush lines are evenly
matched and the ball in the posses
sion of the other side, your rushers
will get through the lines more read
ily and down the opponents, backs
before they are well started. There
is nothing which takes the snap out
of a team more than the constant
and persistent tearing open their
rush line and going through on the
backs of the other side. The coach
or captain must watch his men con
tinually and see that his rushers are
constantly kept busy in attempting
to get through the line. —Cakt. M.
