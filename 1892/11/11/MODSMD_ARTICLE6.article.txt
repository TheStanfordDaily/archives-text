Editors Daily Palo Alto:
The writer of this is no football
player, is not even expert in the
points of the game but, has been a
groat admirer of the manly sport and
an interested spectator of many Har
vard, Yale and Princeton games for
some years past, and has been in po
sition to hear something of the inside
gossip of both Harvard and Yale.
There is no doubt tint Yale easily
leads the football work, and yet she
chooses her team from a less number
of men than Harvard possesses. Yale
has smaller classes aud always has
had, than her great rival. Doth
draw their students from Maine to
California, aud the Mott Havoc rec
ord shows Harvard the athletic equal
of Yale.
Athletic records at Mott Haven
depend chiefly on individual train
ing. Records in football depend
not only on the most perfect indi
vidual training but on the most con
scientious subordination of individual
work to the work of the team as a
whole. To g'et together a great font
ball team such as Yale had last year,
and has had before, several things
are necessary. Thore must be a wise
and dispassionate selection of the
beat material in the University, a
constant and free criticism of the
work of each player, so that his
strong points nmy b.i developed and
his weak points corrected, a devel
opment of individual play by play
ing each man opposite tho strongest
opponents that can be found, and fi
nally and moi'o important still the
subordination of strong individual
play to making the team as a whole
more effective. It is in the first and
last of these tasks that Yale most ex
cels her rivals, Princeton perhaps
being sceond in that particular. Jt
is in this that the traditional "Yale
spirit' shows itself. A Yale man
who had played an important posi
tion jail important! on
the team lust, year, and who had
helped to victory in every game up
to ill great Harvard game at
Npnugfield, was replaced on that
last day by another player. He was
probably disappointed but he did
not show it. "Vale first, last, and
all the time" was his motto. When
1 said to him I was sorry ho didn't
play in the game ho said "Oh, that's
all riÂ»'bt, is a better man
than I, ho is quicker." That is tho
Yale spirit. Harvard graduates in
terested in and familiar with ath
letics at Harvard have several times
in my hearing complained of the
cliques and jealousness that have
stood in the w.iy of success at Har
vard.

Last year Harvard had a strong
aggregate of players in hor team.
Lalce and Corbett were considered
the equals of any halves in the
country. Trafford was a good
kicker, and the forwards were stout
and strong. Harvard relied 011 these
men to count for her, but she relied
too much on individual play, and
the result was that her halves were
tackled before they could get started
with the ball. Trai't'ord did good
service in punting over Ihe line to
keep down the score of Yale; and
that was the most noticeable feature
of Harvard's game, with a team in
dividually equal to Yale's invincible
eleven. If our own team is to main
tain its supremacy on the football
field, candid ites and members of the
team mint show this fine spirit of
Yale. They must submit to the dis
pleasure of the training table and
the practice field, and all students
interested in athletics must see to it
that no petty or personal ambitions
are permitted to impair lite prospects
of victory,
