# Football Practice.
## 
### 
It does not look very auspicious
to the football enthusiast when he
sees about half of the twenty-two
men appear for practice, and these
come straggling in late. No one
can deny but that matters look blue
ns the time draws nearer for the in
tercollegiate game with Berkeley.
All the best coaches in the country
will count for nothing unless the
players by their constant practice,
training, and unity in action demon
strate their determination to win.
The players in the practice games
evince tuo much of ii desire to excel
the other side in number of touch
downs instead of endeavoring to
better the t xecution of their tricks.
Team pla) is the crying demand of
our football work. The interference
does not seem to improve at all.
Most of the men seen) to tackle low
enough but not hard enough. The
line work is better than a week ago,
but not nearly what it ought to be
yet. The slowness of the halves in
starting is exceedingly noticeable.
There are a great number of the men
yet who fail to follow the ball, after
all the mention of this important
point. Aggressive team work is
what the team wants if it is to be a
winning one. Kemcmbei only a
few weeks intervene between now
and the great contest of the year.
Mow 10 the time to make a chango
for the better if one is to be made
this year.
