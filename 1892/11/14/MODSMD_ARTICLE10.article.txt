# Sunday Morning Services.
## 
### 
Yesterday morning l)r. Lathrop,
of the Church of the Advent, in
East Oakland, led the services. The
subject of his address, or sermon us
lie preferred it should be called, was
"Opening the Eyes."
It was a pleasant surprise to
those among the students who are
Kpiscopalians to find that they were
to have their order of services. In
order that all mi;>ht be able to take
part in the services, slips containing
the Episcopal morning service were
placed in all the seats.
All the students took more than
ordinary interest in Dr. Lathrop,
because he is the father of Prof.
Lathrop of the English department.
