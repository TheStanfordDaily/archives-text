The Pacific Eilacational .Journal,
speaking of Professor Hudson's lec
ture before tho San Luis Obispo
county Teachers' Institute, pays:
"As secretary to Spencer, the
speaker was well able to speak in
telligently on tho subject. Speak
ing from the floor, in a clear dis
tinct tone, modest in manner, the
master of a pure English, every
word of which was in its right place,
his address charmed every cultivated
mind."
By a strange coincidence the
hands of the large clock in the tower 1
near tho Central Park ground
pointed to exactly twelve minutes to
tlireo just as the game between the

latter scored just twice as many
points as the former, and last Sat
urday at the last of the tlireo games,
tho hands were at exactly twelve
minutes to three when the game
began, and again one score was just
twice as largo as the other, only this
time the IT.l T . C. won.
