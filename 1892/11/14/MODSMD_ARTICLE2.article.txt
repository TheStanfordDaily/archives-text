second half was in many respects a
repetition of the first. Tobin and
liickelts for the Olympics and Hunt,
Morse and Henry for U. C. did the
principal individual wotlv fur Iheh
respective teams. Both Tobin and
"U. C." Taylor punted at times for
good gains.
In the first part the Olympics
leave a hole in their line, and Henry
jumps into it, like a flash and is on
down the field for thirty fivo yards
when I 'ugh tackles him beautifully
and saves a touch-down. The U. C.
men buck the line, and finally send
little Taylor around light end for
another touch-down. Poor punting
out by i ay lor is the cause of no try
at goal. Sc re 8 4, and remains so

until end of game. Olympics pick
up wonderfully towards the last, and
buck U. C. for straight pains and
are on the ten yard line when time j
is called. Tho great bucking of the
Olympics and Olympic Taylor's mag I
nilicent run to within two yards of
goal were features of the last half.
Tho game was remarkable for the
number of serious fumbles. The U.
0. men especially fumbled the ball.
Every buck, nearly, resulted in a
man's being injured, and time had to
he taken out. Morse runs high and
tackles high. Henry runs back too;
far. "11. C " Taylor is not always
sure in his punts. The U. C. line is
pretty solid as a whole; their block
ing is good. Their principal work
is done with Hunt, who blocks!
splendidly, and with Henry, Morse,
and Benson, who take turns with
the ball.
