# The 						Ratification

### 
The presence of so many demo
crats in the University was not sus
pected till the reception given by
the democratic ladies of Koble on
Thursday evening. The alacrity
with which the call for funds was
responded to after that occasion was
a proof of the enthusiasm of the
democrats and the good will of the
republicans who attended the re
ception.
The coach blinking the band from
Mayfield was caught in the "land
slide," and the early part of the dem
onstration was consequently less mu
sical than it would otherwise have
been. The first speech during the
parade was by Professor Howard,
who said that the * 'landslide" by
which the republican ] arty had been
overtaken was the result of a move
ment begun shortly after their as
cendency into power. The majority
of college men, he said, were demo
crats from conviction, and however
much might be suid in disparage
ment of those having the education
of the nation in charge, their influ
ence was not to be uespised. Sooner
or later the tif irts of the ''literary
feller" are to make themselves felt.
Mr. W'anamaker attributes the de
feit ot hi i party to the "little booth,"
and it is no less a demonstration of
the desites of the American people
than of the corruption of the party
in power to have one of its leaders
shamelessly attribute the result of
the election to the secrecy thus se
cured by the Australian system.
When the procession anived at
Professor Branner's the bind was
present. As its notes ceased, cheers
for the professor were responded to
by a congratulatory speech amply
demonstrating the professor's sym
pathy with the the winning party.

Dr. Elliott said he was no speech
maker; but it was noticed that lie
had 110 difficulty in imparting to the
listeners his approval of the result.
His ideas of political policy, judging
from the cheers, awakened respons
ive feelings.
Professor Swain acknowledged
that the republicans were beaten,
and invited the democratic procession
to walk all over his lawns. Ho said
he used to know a place in Indiana
where were sixty-nine republicans
and one democrat. The sixty-nine
republicans made it their campaign
duty to convert that democrat, and
when election day came the district
was Holid for the g. o. p. But the
good old times seemed to have passed
away. He thought the republicans
(in the University) would get over it
in about a week. Anyway, he felt
like propo ing threo cheers for the
L. S. J. U.
The procession moved over to
Lauro Hall where Mr. Woodruff was
asked to express his views -on the
McKinley bill. He-cited the-case of
a friend who, desiring to bring from
Italy a few works of art as presents,
consulted the free list to see what
could be entered free. He found no
duty was asked on such articles as
ashes, asbestos, asphaltum, bones,
bladders, dried blood, and dust.
Mr. Woodruff said he hoped the
democratic party would find it prof
itable to reverse this policy, and
while permitting and encouraging
the importation of all forms of art,
would secure tho nation's toilers
from the necessity of competing with
the ashes, bjnes, and blood of pauper
Europe.
During the parade a few of our
republican friends whose scalps were
tender from recent beating had ap
propriated the quadrangle hose and
made preparations to prevent the ex
hibition of fireworks with which the
celebration was to be closed. A few
hats were crushed, aud some enthu
siasm was dampened before the pro
cession succceded in conveying their
fireworks to Roble in good order.
The proceedings would have been
more enjoyable if the r.preches had
been made iu the chapel where all
the students could have heard them.
This would have averted the scrim
mage in the quadrangle and the 10-
sulting delay.
