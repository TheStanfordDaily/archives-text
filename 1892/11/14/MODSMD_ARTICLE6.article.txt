Tiivre are many little, almost in
significant things in the recitation
rooms that need repairing. The} |
are not very noticeable now, but if
they are not repaired soon they will
be noticed. The spring contrivances
on some of the dedc arms attached
to the seats are broken; some of the!
castings have b.come detached from
Ihe movable parts of the seats; a few j
narrow wooden strips in'emled to J
cover the seams between the large
pieces (if slate used in the black
boards have become loose; in fact,
a general inspection should be made j
of those rooms by a carpenter, who j
should repair what is out of order, j
At the same time it would he well to i
remove the rust with a cloth moist-1
ened in kerosene from the wire hat j
holders under the seats.
