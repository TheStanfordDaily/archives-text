Many of the students seem at a
loss how to refer to the place where
they are attending as students
"When I first came to this school"
is a remark heard by very fow but
new students. Yet, why is it not
right to call it school? Because cus
tom among university students,
together with a tine discrimination
of the meaning of the word, has lim
ited it in this sense to the definition
given by Webster: An institution of
learning of a lower grade, below a
college or university. Properly
speaking, firtt comes the kindergar
ten, then the school, then the col
lege, which is included in the uni
versity, and lastly the uuiversity, as
educational institutions.
One of tho safest ways, then, not to
offend the fastidious ear of the very
particular in this matter is to say,
lor instance, "I run at Stanford,"
just as one would say—and be defin
itely understood too —"I atu at Har
vard." This manner of expressing
tho fact of one's connection with a
higher institution of learning is mure
definite than the assertion "I am at
school at Palo Alio," or "1 am at
college at Palo Alto," and is much
shorter. Lot us not hear any more
remarks u u.ch rs this fir that beinc
tho best or woist "in school", but
tho best or worst "at Stanford" or
" in tho University."
