li our men want our yell to ling
out in a clear, crisp, harmonious

manner at the great 11. 0.-Stan
i ford game, in such manner that notli
■ ingless than a canonade aecompan
i ied by a score of steam whistles will
be able to drown a single one of our
ralis, the yell lias got to be practiced
and the men have got to got their
; throats used to the severe work they
i will be put to on that day. It is no
pleasure to be compelled to stop
yelling during the progress of such
a game on account of extreme hoars-,
ness or to l»e hoarse for several days!
after because the thro it is not accus- j
tomed to the yell, but it is a pleas
ure to be so prepared for the event
aud to know that you can yell to
your heart's content and to the dis
l comf'iture of the supporters of the
; other team without losing your
j voice. AVe have not had many
opportunities to give the Stanford
| yell this semester. But we shnll
I play the Olympics two games before
, the eventful fourteenth of December.
On the occasion of those games, and
on every other occasion that otters the
slightest chance, we should avail our
selves of an opportunity to exercise
our lungs and throats on our eight
I rubs and a Stanford.
