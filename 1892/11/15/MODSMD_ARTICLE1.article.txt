						HARVARD-YALE GAME.

### 
Now that football is in full blast
on this coast, considerable interest is
taken in the game as played by the
ins'itutions of the far east. It has
only been within a very short time
that the San Francisco newspipers
have published telegraphic reports
of even the big games, but that in
terest is increasing in this line oi'
sport is evident from the fact that
now even the [results of the minor
league games are published Next
Saturday there will ,'ake place the
greatest game of the season, that be
tween Harvard and Yale. It will be
played at Springfield, Massachusetts,
and will probably bo witnessed by
not less than 3 r >,0ll() people, At no
time in the history of the annual
contest between th<- t,\o rival col
leges has so much interest been
shown. To many places in the east
intermittent bulletins will be sent by
wiie. In imitation of this the San
Francisco Examiner has been making
arrangements to give three-minute
bulletins at the Harvard-Yale base
ball game wl ich takes placa at the
Haight street grounds between the
graduates of those two colleges.
Yesteiday a represent,a ! ive of the
Daily Palo Alto called upon the
editor of the Exuminrr to aide the

game where the Olympic-Stanford |
takes place. Mr. Noble, kindly
granted the privilege of our
using the dispatches not in a con
densed form, but just as they are re
ceived in San Francisco. More than
this, Mr. Noble ottered us the use of
their private wires. It is needless to
say tint they were readily accepted
The game at Springfield will prob
ably begin at four o'clock. The dif
ference in time is about three hours,
and by deducting the time taken to
receive and publish the dispatches
we ought to be able to begin pub
lishing returns from the game be
tween hall past two and three oYlo, k,
at which time the Olympic-Stanfoid
game will probably begin. Further
arrangements will be published later
in the week.
