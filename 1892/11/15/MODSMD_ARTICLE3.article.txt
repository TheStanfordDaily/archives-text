# Art of Arts.

Mr. Russell gave last evening the
second of his very interesting course
of lectures. It was entitled, "Art of
Arts," and in it Le gave his audience
a splendid idea of social life both in
England and in America. In Eng
land it is either art, birth, or learn
j ing which gets one into soeiely, but
not trade. In American society you
meet constantly successful cominer
cial people.
In regard to hostesses, Mr. Russell
remarked that there are very few
| good ones, from the simple reason
that they wear such high collars that
they are unable to express anything
but mightiness. This statement
j seemed rather hard to believe, be
cause we had an idea that collars
were out of da'e.
Continuing, Mr. Russell said that
| the greatest powers in the world are
perception and selection. One of
; the first principles in social life to
| make up your mind not to call on
| those you do not like. Gather
around you those whom you like, and
beautify your homes with those
things only which you like. Culti
vate your personality, your personal
taste. There was a time when edu
cation was based on what one ought
to be. Dels ute's principle was, '*l>e
what you can b." 1 here are a great
I many cultured people who cultivate
themselves on the principle of what
they ought to be. Wo do not en
| courage our seasonal tastes btcmse
!we are afraid. We begin to imitate
other people, and it is the bjd things
we imitate.
Mr. Russell thinks that one loses J
greatly by keeping away from soci
| ety, for society puts people on a
plane of expression. "Ten years
ago," said the speaker, "tho Ameri
can youth was all business; now l e
is poetical. ' This remark caused i
the audience considerable amuse
ment. The only way to get individ
ualty is to make art a study; and to
the art progress there needs to be
added social progress.
In the course of his lecture Mr
Russell gave some very interesting
descriptions of lOng'ish homes, and
the manner of receiving in them. I
Mr. Russel euded his lecture by
reading some interesting selections
from Swinburne. lie is an ardent
admirer of that poet, ami he read
with much expression.
