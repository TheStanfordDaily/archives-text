Yesterday there was a convention
of the German Socialist Congress, tho
I work of which will be of interest, to
all interested iu social and economic
problems. The well educated so
cialists, such as Ilerr Vollmar, have
recognized that socialism among a
certain laige class is fast drifting to
a lower stratum, and tends event
ually to become anarchy. He and
his associates have endeavored to
stem the tide, but their eflorts seem
to be in vain. The differenco be
tween these moderate and radical
sections bids fair to increase, and
before the - convent,ion is over to es
tablish permanently two parties,
lhe revolutionary party is growing in
strength, while the minority of the
moderates seems to bo growing
greater.
lhe independent socialistic paity
has published its program, which id
little better than an anarchistic man
ifesto. It rejects state aid, and
would do away wi h the state en
tirely. It advocates the eapturo of
production, the ruin of capitalists by
means of strikes, refusal to enter
into legal obligations, and oppression
of such institutions as church and
schools.
Vollmar and the other educated
members of his party, notwithstand
ing their Utopian and radical views,
have always insisted upon a socid
reconstruction of society by Parlia
mentary reforms, and although thev
belicvo in an equality before the
law, their very education has shown
i them the absurdity of equality in
fact of per. ous unequal iu moral and
mental character and aspirations.
His mistake and that of his followers
has only been that of counting, for
the reconstruction of society, with
human beings, not such as thej are
and always will be, but as they, the
oretically, might be. Furthermore,
lferr Vollmar and adherents, though
socialists, are patriots, and lovo
their country. Very different, how
ever, is the case with Mr. Leibknecht
and I liu Independent Socialists, who
are ready at any moment to make
common cause with Germany's
enemies, provided they can obtain
their aim to abolish tho modern
State. Such views Liebkneckt
openly expressed at a socialist con
gress at Marseilles in September
last. But though he thoroughly
disgusted all true Germans by his
utterances, he gained very little
sympathy from the French, whom
he tried io ii tiler, and when ho
advised all soldiers to refuse their
duty to their State, ho met with
strenuous opposition, even in a
