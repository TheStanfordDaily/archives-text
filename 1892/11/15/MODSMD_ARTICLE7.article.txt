In to-day's paper there is an ac
count of the socialist congress of
Germany which convened yesterday.
This ma}' seem a departure trom the
gereral character of news .which ap
pears in the Daily Palo Alto, but
the reason of this departure can be
explained. The convention is one
in which nearly all University men
whether students of social science
or not are interested. The news
papers do not make much mention
of such items and thence we pub
lish such an account as we have
been able to get.
