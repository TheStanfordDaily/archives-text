In the editorial columns of the
Berkeley Occitlnil there occurs a
paragraph regarding Stanl' rd Uni
versity which disfigures the paper j
in which it occurs and is unworthy j
the university from which it comes. |
The editorial is concerning the foot
ball negotiations-which by the way, j
are all settled before the arrival «»f
the paper. »'ust what was the in
tention of the editor in writing is
impossible to fathom. Peilups lie
has no friendly feeling personally
for Stanford but the college paper is
a poor place to display it. I low
ever it is more probable that the edit
thinks by his slurs to draw the
Stanford pnpers into a contest of
name calling. Tf this is the inten
tion of tie Ociii/mt editor lie may as
well know now that we will engage
in no such contest. Such endless
strifes may be proper for (he aver
age newspaper but our conception
of the college paper is above this.
The vulgur may enjoy the barbed
witticism aimed at a rival but the
aim of the Oa'Ulcnt and the Daily
Palo Alto ought to be above pan
deriug to tho desires of the vulgar
For these reasons we refrain from
making reply to the insinuations of
the Occid'iil hoping that such a
policy aa this we adopt may be ap
preciated and reciprocated on the
part of the liorkelay Occ.iilnil.
