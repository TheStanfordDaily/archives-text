Somr time ago one of (lie instruct
ors in Engli-h exacted a criticism of
the 1) .ULY P.U.O j\T-T'» ft" 5 fin f>Yf>Tvi«p
in composition. Many of the criti
cisms were pointless and evidently
written with the single object of
complying with the exaction of thifl
dcpavtinent. One theme passed the

criticism that the editorial c iluinns
continually suggested schemes Cor
<liiVt rent departments of tit > llni
vol' ity 1 >ut did nothing beside sug
n" (' st. In the writer's estimation the
Daily Palo Alto would lie vastly
lnoro beneficial if its editors and
man niters were formed into a sort
of. Stanford Improvement Associa
tion. The suggestion was ludicrous
at first, but has perhaps been pro-;
duc.tive of some good results both
to the paper and the University it
represents.
We feel that a closer connection
with the great universities of the
east, would be a beneficial thing to
us in many ways. There have
been several ways suggested to us
to assist in 'the bridging over the
distance and awakening more of
our interest in other colleges, but as
yet only one of the suggestions!
I seems to be able to come to niatur- j
ity. In the Ilarvard-Yale football
! game of next Saturday there is a
I chance to awaken some interest in
a subject worth attention. It oc
cured to us that someone could
arrange to have bulletins of tti
game sent here as the Stanford-
Olympic game takes place. Hut
how to get auyone to take hold of
the scheme was the question in
trying to solve the question the sug
gestion in the theme oceuel lo us,
i and we will endeavor to curry it out,
' The Daily Palo Alto will under
| take to have the Harvard-Yale game
1 played on a bulletin board just as
; the great original is played in
| Springfield, Massachusetts. Ihe
! expense attending the enterprise

I amount of trouble be small, yet it
| our efforts are appreciated we will
feel repaid.
