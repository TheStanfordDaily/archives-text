# Fraternities at Chicago.
## 
### 
Somo weeks ago it became known
that tie faculty of the University of
Chicago was seriously considering
whether or not they would sanction
the introduction of tho Greek letter
fraternity into tho new university.
The nutter was one of importance,
and the final decision was withheld
until a full examination of the merits
and t dements of the case could be
made. Little is known of the dis
cussions which took place, but it is
fair to presume from tho result that
the arguments are not all on one side.
The results of the deliberation were
made public by Dr. Harper in an
address tefore the stu lents last Sat
urday. From this it is seen that 110
peremptory injunctions are laid
down prohibiting the establishment
of chapers, but the faculty "advises"
that, they be not established.
In event of the "advice" not being
accepted, the societies wi l be sub
jected to such regulations as will
make their support precarious. Dr.
Harper read the following announce
nient: "The faculty deems theeslab
lishment of secret societies in the
University of Chicago to be undesir
able. In its judgment, tho ends
sought by these societies, so far as
they are laudable, may be secured
by other means, which should be
free from tho objections of secrecy,
of rigid exclusions, and of antago
nism to the democratic spirit which
is inherent in tho highest scholar
ship and manhood, and the most ex
alted citizenship, audit would be
deeply gratified if the high purpose
and lofty feelings of the body of
students will lead them to co-operate
with it by voluntarily excluding
everything that makes against a
broadly fraternal spirit ami a prim
ary concern with the intellectual
aims for which the University of
Chicago was founded."
Dr. Harper explained that the fac
ulty did not prohibit the formation
of chapters, but if foimed they must
submit to the following regulations:
]. Each chapter organized must
submit its house rules to tho faculty
for approval.
2. Each must, appoint a repre
sentative with whom the faculty may
confer at such times as may bo de
sirablc.
ij. Memberships in the societies
must be restricted to students of the
second year academic college and
students of the university colleges.
4. Tho university reteives the
right to withdraw from chapters per
mission to exist in the univerity.
5. The faculty is authorized to add
any regulations which they think
wise in consistency wi h the above.

Considerable spirit was shown by
the students on hearing the report of
the faculty. There exist already
chapters of Beta Theta L'i with six
members, Sigma Chi with four, aud
Phi Kappa IVi with live. The major
ity of these initiates are freshmen,
find such cannot he members of any
Creek letter society, according to
regulation three. There is much
speculation concerning the probable
action of the faculty in theso cases
A meeting is called of these chapters
for some day during (he wtek, when
a response will be made to the de
cision of the faculty.
