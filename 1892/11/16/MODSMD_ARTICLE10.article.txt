Soivifi time ago the formation of
a *â€¢ Political Science" club was sug
gested, but no steps as yet have
been taken toward the organization
of one. With the strong depart
ments ol history and economics t, >
back such a scheme there is no
reason why it should not be pre
eminently successful. The other
departments here in the University
are well represented by societies,
where various matters are discussed
and carefully prepared papers pre
sented. The importance which
some of our social and economic
questions are assuming, plainly
demonstrates the need of such organ
izations as auxiliaries to the courses
in economics and hisory. The
large number taking history and
political science is a suHicieut, guar
antee that enough interest will be
taken to injure the Ruocossful opcr
ation of such a club. All that is
needed now is for some persons to
volunteer to take hold and carry out
to completion the organization of
this body. If the time for such

work can not. l>o spared now it
hi ion 1(1 bo attended to immediately
after the Christmas holidays.
