I'urdue Univeisily was pleasantly
surprised last we.k by the announce
ment that Air. Amos llaive'ow, a
wealthy farmer of Clinton county,
had placed $3">,000 in the hunds of
the trusteis, with which to build
new shops, with bost modern equip
ment.
In si ite of its opulent neighbor,
the Chicago" I niversity, Northwest
ern opened its doors this year to
2 400 students, Iho largest number
in its history. Northwestern has a
c ;rps of 200 able instructors, a total
endowment, of $2.7 13,000, ft, campus
of thirty Evanston acres, which,
with the university buildings, is
valued at 000.
It teemed to us at. first that we
had been treated with extreme dis
courtesy by the Stanford football
manager. Letters and telegrams
were sent to him from our manager,
on the subject of an inter-collegiate
match, and until last Tuesday they
were entir ly ignored and left un
answered. On fmther reflection,
however, we see the perfect justice
of the proceeding, for we had neg
lected to enclose s'amp for reply.
In the future we must be more busi
ness-like and practical. — Occulmf.
Cornell's Spelling Match.
To aid the football management, a
spelling match has been arranged
between ten prominent Ithaca citi
zens and ten professors. The event
will probably take place in Wilgus
Opera Houso. The date of the
match will probably be about Nov.
10th, and will be a most amusing af
fair, drawing out crowds of people
from town and hill. If possible the
house will be divided, tho Cornell
men on one side and the town peo
pie on the other. The Cornell lianjo
and Mandolin Club will play a few
selections. A definite program will
be announced in a few days.—Cornell
