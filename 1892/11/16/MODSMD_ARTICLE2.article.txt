# Yale Fraternities in Trouble.
## 
### 
When a student, at Yale last, spring
received injuries at a secret society
initiation which resulted in death,
tho two leading junior societies
agreed that in the future the initia
tions should merely consist of the
administration of the fraternity oath,
and tint blindfolding aud other
rough play should bo abolished. It
has lately come to tho notice of the
faculty that the o'd, harsh customs
and practices have been renewed, and
as a result the college authorities
have dropped ii| on tho society men
with considerable force. The mem
bers of the I>. K. E. fraternity have
been given three alternativesâ€”eithei
that it be converted into an open
club, abolished, or that a member of
the faculty be allowed to attend
every meeting, and that tho meetings
shall end sit midnight.
