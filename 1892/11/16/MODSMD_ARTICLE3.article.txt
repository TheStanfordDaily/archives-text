# Football Practice.

### 
The gi'eatest eiiticism lliat could
be made on the practice last niglit
was the complete failure of tbo men
on botli sides to understand the sig
nals. The tackling as a general
thing was low but not hard enough.
There is no necessity in the tackier
being dragged for yards after the
tackle. Low, bard tackling will
avoid it. The interference at times
was good, at others, very unsatis
factory. A good interferer never
gets in the road of liis runner. The
slow, dragging game cf several weeks
ngo is coming in vogue again. More
snap and vim, with rapid play i*
what makes a winning game. There
is one hopeful hi-11 and that is the
appearance of heavy, active new
men on the field. These were the
men who lined up:
