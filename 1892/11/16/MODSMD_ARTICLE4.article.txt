### 
The regular Tuesday evening
lecture was delivered by Dr. bran
ner on tho above subject. It was
throughout a well-written discourse j
on tho condition of the Brazilian
convict system as seen on tho island
of Fernando in the South Atlantic,
with deiived lessons for Americans'
on the subject of prison reform. Dr. j
Bran ner from his position on tho j
Imperial Geological Survey was well
able to estimate the social condition ;
of the island, and through a native
servant learned many interesting de
tails.
Capital crimes are punished on
this isle. Tho total population is

convicts but families of same. This
intermingling reduces all to a
common level, and the environment |
is so hopelessly evil that the short
term prisoners most always return
for longer terms or for life.
The convicts do not look upon
their condition as had, and spend
their time in idleness, conversing on
crime and shrewd practices in ciim-j
inal method. They admire crime
and naturally gravi ate toward it.
Some prisoners are treated with
severity and otheis with extreme
paitiality, there being no effort to
lit the punishment to tho crime.
Dr. Branuer thought that too
much of this looseness existed in
American country jails aud city
prisons, there places of punish
ment being made mere schools for
crime. The older prisoners become
teachers; the younger ones, apt I
scholars, and the sla'e furnishes a
meeting place for professor and j
pupil.

He asserted that nothing was to
be gained by familiarity with evil,
and scored our sensational press,
public school system, and open
courts as abettors of crime.
