We would be glad to see a
heartier interest manifested in the
second football field, for we believe
that it might be made of great ser
vice in bringing out and developing
new players. It is true that they
cannot all get on the Varsity
team, but the class teams are yet to
be chosen. Moreover, hard, con
scientious playing this year will
give the candidate just that much
better chance making the 'Varsity
next. There are plenty of men in
the University whose anatomy seems
to indicate great football possibili
ties. Let everyone who considers
this last remailc as personal come
out some night aud see what he can
do.
