hi view of tlie fact that many of
our faculty ami students have at one
time been connected with the Indiana
University, it may be well to state
how that institution is progressing in
the educational world. The follow
ing facts were taken from a circular
just received by a resident A. B of
the Indiana University:
There are at present nearly 500
students attending the collegc. With
the usual winter additions, over GOO
are expected to be in attendance by
spiing. The following proftssois
have been added to the faculty: W.
L. Bryan, E H. Griggs, head of the
department of General English; B.
W. Snow, late of Berlin, professor
of physics; John 11. Commons, de
partment of economics and social
science; John A. Couch, in the law
college. The Indiana legislature is
to be asked at its next session for ad
ditional buildings which are greatly
needed.
