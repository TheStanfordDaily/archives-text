Harvard Asks Her Alumni for 8-100,000.
Soldiers' Field, Harvard's new
athloiic grounds presented by
Colonel Higginson, is to be lifted up
for all branches oi' athlotics. On ac
count ot' the increased number of
students at Harvard, there being
over a thousand more than there;
were five yeais ngo, and also by
reason of the consequent demand for
new buildings, the (11 lioimes and
Jarvis fields, which will 1 ave to be
encroached upon to a certain extent
by new buildingß, cm no longer ac
commodate the atlilo ic interests o(
the university.
A committee is trying to raise
$100,000 to provide facilities for nil
kinds of sports, including a boat
house, grand stand etc., 011 this new
field. The novel idea of an appeal to
the alumni has been tried with the
result tliat $10,000 has already been
subscribed. I»ut, as a more thorough
means of securing every possible
subscription each alumnus h:is been
sent a circular letter signed by the
committee, and containing a letter
of approval from President Kliot, in
which ho assures the committee in
the strongest terms on behalf of the
collego authorities, corporation over-
Beers, and faculties, of their earnest
desire for the immediate success of
the enterprise. One of these letters
was received by a Stanford professor
to-day. It is not only an appeal to
the class spirit of each alumnus, but
to his loyalty towards ami Jove for
his alma mater.
