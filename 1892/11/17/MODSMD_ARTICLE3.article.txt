# An Historic Poster.

One of the original German
Broadsides published by Frederick
William 111, during the revolution
of 1848, has been presented to the
library by Andrew D. White, our
professor of European History, who
is at present United States Minister
to Russia. The large poster-like
proclamation is framed and hangs
in one corner of the reading room.
It should bo of interest to all Ger
man students but more particularly
to the students of History III, who
are now studying the very period in
European history with which it is
associated.
