Mr. Porter's Second Football Letter, j
The qua'ities of character that;
should mark the "successful football'
general do not differ materially from
those Unit bring emsctss iu any
other enterprise.
Foremost, of course, is the knowl
edge nnd enthusiasm .that only come
to one who loves his work, however,
without the ability to uiybrataml
men and the diplomacy necessary to
get from each his full (jnota of en
deavor, a captain's enthusiasm will
count for little.
To any one who considers, it is not I
remarkable that a captain who hand- j
les a' team with success should fall j
oIV in individual play. AVith the
anxiety and worry incident to plan
ning and meeting attacks, comes a !
nervous strain that must lower the
standard of a captain's play,
In preparing fora big game a cap
tain can not be too careful in the
matter of personal feeling. On too
many teams superior new men yield
to inferior old ones simply because
of the prestige gained by having
boon on the Varsity teim. Again,
112 uuve in miml colleges where the
fraternity fet ling has been so domi
nant lhat the college colors have
never been worn by representative
learns, and others where the captain's
personal feeling unwittingly led him
to substitute poorer players for those
who should have held the positions.
In one particular case I recall the
Alumni of the college forced the
captain to resign. Ho wa*, by the
way, one of the best full backs that
have graced the Intercollegiate
League.
We will assume that the captain
has been able to Let out and organ
ize the team; lie is suro that ho can
till any position with a good man
should the regular be laid off, and
that every man knows his position
through and through, and moreover
that every rule in the code is to him j
as his alphabet. When such a team
is developed the college men go
about smiling —the game is won; so
they think. Bnt for the captain the
work that demands his most untir
ing energy and patience has just bo- {
gun. To weld into the perfect j
madic eleven parts, b • they ever
ho perfect, is a greater task than
the developing of the parts,
themselves. Not only is it the
greater but it is the essential task.
One sees at, Cambridge and Nassau |
every year the most perfect type of
individual players and it is usual to
find from eleven io thirty in each
college. Having been at New Ha-j
veil and seen players th re that
lacked brilliince one says, "why,
Yale can't win this year," but shej

does win almost every time. The
onlooker only noticed the slowness
of the play ho did not see the pre
cision with which every thing at
tempted was carried out. Could he
have seen the team a week later the
same plays would still liave looked
common place and but a trille faster.
But they will be fa->t enough at
Springfield or New York and their
deadly precision will send dismay to
the hearts of the crimson or the or
ange and black.
1 believe fully that no football
team excepting t hose from Yale Col
lege , has ever achieved its full pos
sibilities.
Year after after year, playing trams
composed cf inferior iucn, Ydlo goes
on to victory because she noes hLiW
and masters every detail of team
play and lets rapidity come only
with perfect knowledge of the tac
tics.
The usual manner of starting a game
by the wedge is to my mind unscien
tific, audit has become so common
that it is valueless. The ten vavds
advantage given the holders ol the
ball renders it possible aud invari
ably profitable to start the game under
cover of interference. There is no
reason why a propeily executed
start oil' should fail to yield ten
yards, and uiore often lit teen or
twenty yards.
Too often the team work tiaining
is confined to olion ive work. lhin
is a radical eiror. livery man should
bo trained in the pocketing of run
ners, and the men should be in
structed to work in purs when the
interference is at all good. It ;.h mid
ho understood always, it possible,
who is to break the guardians, and
who to take the runner. 1 have
often found that where it was im
possible to get at the runner, and no
immediate assistance was at hand,
that to push an interfervr into the
runner would so disconceit the lat
ter that he was easy prey; or where
this is impracticable, to push one in
terferer into auother will produce a
momentary confusion that may often
be of value to the tackier.
The favorite method of stopping a
run through the line seems to bo for
the linemen to drop in their tracks
and trust to the clumsiness of tlie
opponents, or to the tackling oftht ir
i acks to stop a man. If the runner
is clumsy he will fall over the pros
trate form, ami if be is not he is sure
of from three to ten yards gain
unless the backs are exceedingly alert
and good tackters.
One of Harvard's best line men
has a method for stopping line runs
that is most effective. lie allows
