"Were the two clocks 011 the man
tles in the Roble lobby, and the two
clocks on the mantles in the Encina
lobby, and the one in the reception
room at Encina placed there only as
ornaments V or was the money ex
pended on such expensive time pieces
that the students who use these
rooms constantly might know the
correct time ? It certainly is not
a very arduous task for the person in
charge of each lobby to wind these
clocks every eight days, or even
every day, aud to keep them set at
the correct time. Ofton it is very
convenient fora student to know the
exact time when he is leaving or en
tering either lobby. The clock in
the library is appreciated by every
student who uses the reading room
to study in between hours, But
what good would it do if it was never
wound or set ?
