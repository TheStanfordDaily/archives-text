When the Olympic team comes
down bero Saturday it is our duty to
show them every attention; for in a
certain sense they are our guests.
Wo should remember that every
courtesy wo extend to as ringer vis
iting the campus increases and helps
to maintain the reputation that Stan
ford students have already gained
for gentlemanly conduct; and we
should bear in mind also that only a
few thoughtless remarks, only a few
hisses or jeers at a visiting team dur
ing a game may hazard that reputa
tion and lose us friends and sympa
thizers. Then too, the Olympics,
may be not nil the team, but some
of them at least, think that in a cer
tain measure the umpiring and rtfer
eeing of the Stanford men iti the
last two Olympic-U. C. games was a
cause for their defeat. By our ac
tions towards them on Saturday we
must attempt to dispel this idea and
to let them see that Stanford men
are gentlemen.
