# A
						NEW BRANCH OF ATHLETICS.
## Stanford to Have a Crew. 
### 
Stanford has her football, bise
ball, tennis, and track athletics;
now she in to have a crew. This is
the one phase of collego athletics
that has been neglected, simply on
account of lack of facilities. The
need has been met. A boat club
has been organized whose constitu
tion has been signed by some twenty
charter members. Clyde L Patter
son is the chief instigator of the
scheme.
The first, meeting was held in En
cina ll.ill on Wednesday evening,
when Messrs. Stichell and Can field
were respectively elected temporary
chairman and secretary of the club
At present the purpose of the club
is to establish a boat club owning
1 touts for racing and pleasure. If is
the idea of the members, when the
club assumes larger proportions to
turn the management over to the
college at hi. tic authorities. At
present a three-fourths vote of the
club admits one to membership.
Initiation fee is $'2.f>o. Honorary
members will be elected. The fac
ulty and others will compose this
latter class. Ladies will also be ad
mitted to membership. For the
present the club is to be known as
the b. S. -Ir. U. I.oat Club.
The large resevoir a short (lis
tauce b ick of the workshops is to be
the immediate scene of active oper
ations. It is already being filled
from the Spring Valley main, and
will remain permanently so This
affords a half mile stretch, which is
as long as many college crews in the
East practice on.
Plans are to be obtained next
week for an eight oar shell, about
r?0 feet long, and under the super
vision of Clyde Patterson work will
be immediately begun upon it. The
boat will cost about $1 .">(). Later on
it is the intention of the club to send
East fora regulation shell.
A boat house where pleasure boats
can be kept and a bathing house are
also to be constiueted on the banks
of the lake. The crow will be
picked in the same manner as the
football and baseball teams. Strong
middle weight men are the kind of
material wanted. When the crew is
in piopei condition, challenges will
be sent to various San Francisco
clubs and it is to lie hoped that our
sister institution, the university of
California, will place a competing
crcw in the racc nc?:l spring.
It will probably be but a short
time beforo the cardinal color,
which the club has adopted, will be
seen upon the lake, and the talked
of crew a reality.
