# An Ideal Art School.
## 
### 
Professor 15. C. Brown ami Miss
Ames, of the art department, visited
the Oakland High School and the
Broadway Grammar School of Son
Francisco yesterday, for the purpose
of examining into the methods and
work done in art in the public
schools. Natural methods are
used and so successfully in the
Broadway Grammar School, that
Professor Brown declared the pro
gress of the pupils simply wondorful.
Miss Jean Parker is principal.
She is of Scotch descent, and so
thorough are her methods, and so
successful the results of her work,
that she is allowed to defy the state
text books, and to introduce her own
system into her department.
The pupils under her range in age
from five to fourteen years, and draw
exclusively from natural forms.
Loaves and flowers are, on account
of being easily obtained, chielly used
for designs. The older of the pu
pils, say about ten and twelve years
of age, draw full sizo pictures of one
another. There is also a sub rusn
class in charcoal and red chalk por
traits. At various ages they paint
very successfully in opaque water
colors ou tinted paper little studies
of dil'l'oront plants and flowers
The interesting thing is that Miss
Parker does not draw nor profess to
iÂ»u ii drawing {(jiichoi*. ithcr do
ihe other teachers of the school.
AVhen asked how this was, she said
fclio tries on tho pupils in thoirdraw
ing ( 'a thorough course of letting
alone," and she is certainly achiev
ing marked success.
