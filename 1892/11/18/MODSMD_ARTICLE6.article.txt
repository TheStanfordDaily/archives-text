# THIRD FOOTBALL LETTER.
## Mr. Porter Discusses Captaining and Strategy and Their Value on the Field. 
### 
After the start off the captain
i should vary his agressive tactics till
he finds the enemy's weakest point,
and wln nit is found, to bombard
I this point mercilessly. There is
nothing c| uite so demoralizing to a
1 team as to feel some point continu
ally slipping away in the defense
i It is the beginning of the rout Soon
the backs are drawn in to the
i defense of the particular place that
is yielding. Now, when they ex
pect and fear the attack on this
point, is the time that a rapid play
ing team begins to deal out the un
expected Suppose the weak point
is at center; the massing of bucks
and preparation fo receive attacks
there gives the opposing captain a
splendid chance to work fÂ«int plays,
; such as the double and triple pass
i and feints at line breaking where the
ball is sent, to the end
A point that most captains invari
i ably lose sight of is the advisability
of kicking When and how to kick
are questions too lightly considered.
Even if no ground is gained, it is a
relief to your team, when the third
J down comes, to see the leather float
towards the opponents' goal; beside s
there is always a chance that the
back will fumble, and a sprightly
end following close often has a
chance to gain yards that the run
ning backs might have worked half
I an hour to cover. It, always pays to
kick on tiie third down; and invaiia
bly to surprise an opponent with a
kick when his backs are close, yields
a profitable return, and if an ex
; change of kicks will yield you live
yards kick at every chance. A good
kicker used in the tiist half will often
so weary the enemy that they, iu the
second half, will be entirely unpre
pared and unfit, to meet fast, running
or hard plunging.
Of course no rule can be given for
winning games. No team ever puts
up exactly the same defense, and
moreover the same situations never
occur twice in a game to train the
men till their eyes are so sure and
quick that they see the course of the
ball instantly, even in the most con
fusing passing, and to train their
musclesTdl they are in perfect con
trol, and afterward to weld the eleven
trained men into a unit. This is the
work of the captain la fore his men
take the field. He may have been a
grand success in forming the tt ani,
but a big game calls for other quali
ties. The captain who goes into the
fight with a big reputation is more
tliun likely to come out vanquished

and his reputation gone. JJeecher
and Cummock were generals in the
higher sonse. Besides these there
have been, within the last decade, no
He'd captains worthy of the name
I suppose no one doubts that a
poor team with a good captain has
more than an even chance against a
good team poorly handled. Year
after year Princeton went to New
York with better men and as good a
team as Yale, and year after year
they were outgeneraled; yet Yale's
captains, excepting Jieecher, have
never been gr<at. In 18S8 the
Princeton team should and could
have won under competent direction.
Thecaptun was one of the best
players that, ever stood on the line,
and he was supported by such men
as the Hodges, Black, Ames, and
' Old House" Janeway. In fact,
every man of tho team was more
than good, and still Yale won. In
1889 Poe, who, while a splendid
ijuarter back and a royal good fellow,
is much overrated as a captain, could
have cut his team to victory ol :iU
to 0 had he handled them properly.
The great fault with most captaius
is that they have not tho courage, or
rather the confidence, to tike imme
diate action against the slightest
weakness of their opponents. It
takes an unlimited confidence in
one's team to change the style of
play immediately to take advautage
of a wavering that may bo only im
aginary.
I believe that it would be of vast
advantage and benefit to the gamo
to introduce non-playing field cap
tains, as is done in Lacrosse.
The points 1 would impress on a
captain would be, to be sure of his
men; to be certain that each per
fectly understands every other man's
duties, as well as his own, on every
play, and that when he is not other
wise engaged he is aiding someone
else in tho work. Keep the men
busy all tho time; don't let them
lag or rest during practice; get them
used to an hour and a halt' of such
hard work that no team can tire them
cut. lie should not be deceived
about the team's capabilities. If
ho knows just what each man and
the team can do, and how to use
their abilities at the right time, the
chances of victory aiv all his, pro
vided that the teams are in any de
gree of equal ability.
