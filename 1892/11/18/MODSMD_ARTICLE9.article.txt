Before the dale of the Berkeley
game was arranged our clioce would
have been the 22d day of Feb
ruary. There are good reasons why
that date would bo the best one to
have established as the fixed time
for the annual contest. The season
for football in the east is practically
closed on Thanksgiving day, and
should our season c pen then we
would he able to obtain many avail
able coaches whose engagements
close with the end of the eastern
season. There is another side to the
question, however. It is evident
that by placing the game so late we
would only prolong the fc-.sou.
Both teams would begin work at
once at the beginning of the college
year and would work themselves
stale before the close. No other ath
letics would receive attention until
after the game and it would bo a ser
ious blunder on the part of our ath
letic management to neglect every
thing for football. Baseball, tennis,
and track athletics are as important,
as football, although the attention
paid to the latter just now would
seem to ehow this statement to be
untrue. People have come to look
upon football as tbo fall game and
any change as this might defeat the
very purpose we have in view,
namely, that of making the football
season a success.

Further, concerning tho date of
the championship match. It seems
probable now that the game with
Berkeley will take place on Decem
ber 10t.li instead of December 14th
as was first announced. When
Clemans and Champlin arranged for
the date there was a compromise on
the date of Dec. 11th. The matter
was left open so that, if we desiret\
the 10th could bo substituted. This
latter is on Saturday. The faculty
here would probably have granted a
holiday had it been thought neces
sary to play on Wednesday, even
though it should somewhat interfere
with the collego work. But when it
is taken into consideration the ser
ious interruption incident to the
preparation for and the recovery
jiuiii the event it is to be doubted
whether we would bo acting in accor
dance with our best welfare in play
ing tho game on Wednesday. The
position of the faculty in the matter
is one which every student ought to
appreciate, and further, ought to

show liih appreciation. "When it is
considered how the outside world
would view the declaring of a holi
day in the middle of the woalc fora
game of football even, if it wore the
cbampionchip game, Ave must be
sensible that unlimited criticism
would bo showered upon tin 1 faculty.
Yet notwithstanding a full know
h clge (if this, and of an appreciation
of the harm to the University worlc,
the faculty placed sufficient reliance
upon the judgment of the students
to allow them to make their own
choice in the matter. This is only
following out the policy which the
faculty has used in dealing with
student affairs, it will be well to
compare this policy with that, adopt
rd in some other universities, the
University of Chicago for example.

The reason for the non-appear
ance of Mr. 11. L. Porter's football
letter in the issue of last Tuesday as
announced can be explained by stat
ing that in the Berkeley-Olympic
game, Mr. Porter fractured the acro
nian process of the shoulder and
was unable to write. In the i sues
of yesterday and to-day thorp appear
the two letters of this work. We
are fortunate in securing these let
ters, for they are sound on the sub
ject treated, besides being the rx
pression of a gentleman who ha
high ideals of amateur athletics and
university life in general.
