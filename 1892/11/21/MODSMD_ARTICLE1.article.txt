To the Dully Pulo Alto.
Springfield, Mass., Nov. 19tli,
3.25 p.m.—G.irulous Multiplicity
Haverford Yellow McCrea deposes
Sanford Graves deposes C Bliss
Azure alodial volcano.
As this remarkable and intelligent,
despatch was received at the tele
graph office here, a sigh of relief
greeted it. The author of the sigh
was the representative of the Daily
Palo Alto, who had waited in sus
pense for nearly an hour w ndoring
if everything would work smoothly
and the Daily would fulfill its prom
ise and report the Springfield game.
The despatch was quickly decipher
ed and read as follows: (Garulous)
—The teams have appeared on the
field. (Multiplicity)—The line up
was as follows. (Haverford) —The
Harvard team was just as I made it
out for you. (Yellow, etc ) —So
was the Yale team with the except
ion of McCrea, who displaces San
ford and Graves, who displaces C.
Bliss. (Azure) — Tales win tho toss.
(Alodial) —Aud chooses the bail
(Volcano) —Starts with a Y and
gains five yards. This was re-ar
ranged and sent to our football
field where the Olympic Stanford
football gamo w;is in progress. Here
it was transferred to a blackboard
aud tho 900 people on tho grounds
knew how the greatest football
game of the season began. From
then till the close of the game curi
ous cipher despatches at intervals ol
about six minutes told how the blue
and crimson fought over the leather
spheroid.
The management of tho bulletins
was undertaken and carried out by
the Daily Palo Alto. It is our
object to create an interest iu col
leges in general and thus stimulate
better and more lively college
spirit within the Stanford Univer
sity. On the field was an enthusi
astic football crowd, many of whom
had seen the great Now England
colleges in thoir annual contest, and
felt an interest in the outcomo of
this one. We were enabled to carry
out our plan only through the kind
ness of the Examiner. That paper
had ordered the bulletins to bo sent,
to the Central Park grounds in San
Francisco where tho Yale-Harvard
baseball took place When it
was announced that tho Examiner
would undertake such a scheme, ap
plication was made by tho Daily
Palo Alto, and through courtesy
of Mr. Noble, Sunday editor of the

Examimr, the bulletins were placed
at our disposal. If there is a suf
ficiently largo number of students
who remain .it Palo Alto during the
Thanksgiving recess we may make
an attempt to report the Yale-
Sprint: field game in a similar man
