Why not have the bulletin boards
kept as orderly as possible? If eacb
one who puts up a notice would seo
that it is removed when its term of
usefulness is fulfilled, wo should not
be obliged to read through a score
of last month's class announcements
before coming to anything of im
portance. Besides being uninter
esting aud a great waste of time, a
bulletin board so treated misses its
object, as many people prefer pass
ing by to reading through the old
notices again.
