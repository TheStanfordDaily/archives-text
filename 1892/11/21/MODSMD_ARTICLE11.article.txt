There is no reason to feel exultant
over tho results of Saturday's game.
It was merely a friendly practice
game with the Olympics, and in 110
way a fair test of their streugth.
Next Saturday, in the city, a far dif
ferent game will bo played, a game
in which the Olympics will summon
all their strength to retrieve their
rocent defeats. Our men can not be
on their guard too carefully. The
bad effects of Saturday's game is
seen in the over-confidence displayed
on all t-ides. There is no surer way
to defeat than in too much confi
uuuoe, not only in the p!«y»vs them
selves, but in their supporters also.
It is true enough that our team
played in good form,and the} should
be praised and stimulated to higher
exertion, but they need also io take

into consideration the crippled con
dition of the Olympics, their utter
lack of learn play. They want to
recall what the team work of the
Oak In ud High School accomplished,
and think what is before them Dec.
10th.
