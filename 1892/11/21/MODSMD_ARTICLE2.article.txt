# The
						Alumni Baseball Game.
## 
### 
Tho Alumni of Harvard and
Vale played their annual game of
baseball in San Francisco last Sat
urday in Central Park. This an
nual game is a charity affair and is
patronized by tho best society in tho
city. The teams are compoed of
players who have at sometime been
at Harvard or Yale. An exception
was made in this case last Saturday
by the introduction of two profes
sional catchers, liuth and Stalliugs.
As most of tho players have but
little time to practice, tho game does
not inspire good bill toshers with
admiration.
The handsome turnouts covercd
with crimson or blue were the mobt,
attractive feature of the day. The
enthusiasm shown by tho alumni
for their alma mater was displayed
by the vociferous horn blowing and
repeated yells. When the Examiner
bulletin announced that Yale had
scored there was great cheering
from the wearers of the blue and a
consequent depression on tho side
of tho ciimson. The feelings of the
latter were somewhat soothed by
their victory in baseball â€”score 12
to 11.
