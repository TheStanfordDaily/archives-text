The Chamberlin Free Wool Bill
was discussed by tho House last
Saturday evening. The debate was
interesting, and ably conducted
throughout, and before its close de
veloped the fact that a majority of
our hypothetical legislators are not
in favor of placing wool or woolen
gooels on the free list, in spite of
recent political signs throughout the
country at large. Speeches were
made by Chamberliu, Itose, Wigle,
Zion, llaz/.ard, Hughes, and Gru
well, Mr. Wigle's remarks being es
pecially worthy of note. At the
next meeting—there will be no meet
ing this week on account o/ vacation
— tho entire evening will be devoted
to tho amendment, to permit all
students of the University to bectmie
members.
