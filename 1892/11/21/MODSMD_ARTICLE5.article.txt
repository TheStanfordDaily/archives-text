# The 						Olympic – Stanford Practice Game.
## 
### 
A v.. ry large crowd of interested
spectators witnessed ihe practice
football game Saturday between a
team chosen from the Olympic club
and our second eleven, Boble Hall
attended en masse and many resi
dents of the neighboring towns were
there to see Stanford win. Be
fore the gamo commenced it was
found that two of the Olympic men
had failed to come. Grosh and Stuart
were put in to fill the vacancies and
play commenced.
The Olympics won the toss and
chore tho ball. After two ineffect
ual attempts to gain the requisite
five yards, Tobin tried a kick and
advanced tho ball well down into
Stanford territory. But as soon as
our eleven took the bull and com
•menced agertssive play ii was seen
that, at least, we would make a
creditable showing ngainst the
Olympics.
Harrelson first took the ball
around the end for quite a gain.
Then Frankenheimer and Kennedy
in turn successfully bucked the
heavy centre of their opponents.
The ball was steadily being work
ed up the fit Id until finally it was
lost on the fourth down by a doubt
ful decision of Bicketts, the referee.
The Olympics then tried to circle
the ends but tho quick work and
good tackling of the Stanfords pre
vented any large gains. Soon Tobin
was compelled to resort to a kick
and considerable territory was
gaii.od, but the ball went to our
team. Several ineffectual attempts
to buck tho Olympic centre were
made aud then McLaine, playing
left tackle, and assisted by the good
interference of Harrelson, made the
first touch-down amid great applause
and confusion.
The crowd immediately closed
around tho players and it was sev
eral minutes before play could be
resumed. Kennedy made aver)
good goal kick and the ball went to
tho center in the Olympics' pos
session. Soon they lost the ball by
a fumble and by the skillful run
ning of Harrelson and Code the ball
was forced to within the Olympics'
five yard lino. Failing to make five
yards in three attempts the ball was
then given to the Olympics. Tobin
stood behind the goal-line and tried
to kick tho ball up the field but
Harrelson interfered and spoiled
his kick ami Tobin was forced to
make a safety. Soon after this time
was called for tho first-half, with
the score 8 to 0 in favor of Stanford.
Burnett received a very bad
sprain of tho ankle early in the

game ami was succeeded by C.
Downing.
After a short rest tbe men lined
up again with the ball in Stanfouls'
p ssession. Matters were rushed
this half and soon by quick work
and good interference, Code and
Fiaukenheimer had each made
touch-downs. Kennedy success
fully kicked both goals and the score
then stood 20 to 0.
Within the last few minutes of
the second half the Olympics had
been steadily forcing the ball into
Stanford territory. When at about
the thirty five yard line Tobin con
cluded to try a play seldom success
fully accomplished, namely, a lield
drop kick. It was successful, and
spectators, players and all joined in
the applause of a play so well car
ried out.
Soon after time was called and the
crowd surged upon the field and
carried our boys oil' in triumph.
Score 20 to 5.
To say the least, the playing of
the second eleven surprised us all.
13y hard practice and splendid team
work a victory was secured.
Harrelson gained ground every
time he was sent with the ball.
Frankenheimer ami L. Mr.Laine
proved themselves capable of buck
ing even the formidable Olympic
center.
The Olympics were not well train
ed and but few of the team had any
idea of the signals used. No doubt
they would have made a better
showing had the signals been un
derstood.
Before starting the play Captains
Sherrard and Cleuians agreed to call
this only a practice game and not to
consider the Olympics as the repre
sentative team of the Olympic Club.
In marked contrast to last year's
game, the best of feeliug prevailed
and no ungentlemanly or rough
playing was indulged in by either
side. The following were the pla}'-
