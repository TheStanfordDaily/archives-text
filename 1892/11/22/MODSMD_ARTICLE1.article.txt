# The 						Art of Dress.
## 
### 
Mr. Uussell's subject last night
gave him a chance to make some
rather neat points against the so
called dress reformers, as well as to j
carry on tho more hackneyed war
fare against tho slaves to style. To
study the art of dress properly,
says Mr. Russell, one must first
study the body and particularly the
method of right breathing. No ob
struction such as tight clothing
must be tolerated, but the chest
well up and forward, is the first
step to that carriage which will give
clothes some character. (A per
ceptible straightening up amongst
tho audience ) Running, swimming,
riding and such exercise, in which
one must breathe well in order to
get on at all, give the best results.
Mr. Russell caunot li t. a goodj
chance go by without getting in a
stroke at the almighty collar. It is
sad to think that the death blow has
not yet been dealt to that small but
tall article, and that even now
dame fashion is preparing to herald
forth for it another season's reign!
Let us strive to thwart this terrible
design; if not 011 tho score of health
nor beauty, then for the preserva
tion of our personality, the desire to
increaso and develop our individual
power; for we all know the impos
sibility of growth without freedom.
Do not bo afraid of reform. Art is
not a study of becoming conspic
uous; art is the right thing in the
right place.
Mr. Russell denounced alike the
kid glove martyrdom, tbe-heavy
common sense shoe fallacy, and the
extravagancies of tho dress reform
fanaticsim. Though ease and
freedom do not imply beauty and
harmony, they can bo educated into
it, and ignorant freedom is at least
011 tho light track, which is more
than can bo said of ignorant
bondage.
The latter half of the Iccturo was
devoted to an interesting discussion
011 the value of color and of access
ories to dross. INIr. Hussell's theory
of harmony, which has been the
central theme in all his lectures,
found opportunity here for numer
ous striking examples. He lays
great stress on having character
istic trinkets and advocates having
a woman spend one-half her yearly j
dtoss allowance 011 lasting things.
On the subject of men, hats un
foitunately, aro open to quite as:
much criticism as women, with some j
slight advantage perhaps 011 the i
side of the latter; for whatever can
bo said against tho inconsequent!
trifle of lace and jet, he certainly
would shrink from entering into a

contest of utter negation with the
fair round derby or tho stove pipe
curiosity with its stove-polish shine.
Let your dress he in harmony
with your own nature, and /o, first,
of all, according to tho old maxim,
"know thyself."
The next lecture will bo on "Art
Criticism," and Mr. Russell will
read from Rossotti.
