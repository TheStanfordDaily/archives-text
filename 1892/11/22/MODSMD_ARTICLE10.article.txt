It is not very long before last
year's wild enthusiasm will be re
peated and we will again accompany
our team to San Francisco to see them
play the U. C. We will have many
more supporters and sympathizers at
the game this year than we had last
year. Although on that occasion
nearly half of the six thousand peo
ple that witnessed the game wore
and waved the cardinal or yelled for
the new university which was not,
yet six mouths" old, we had then
but one banner for our team to dis
play on the field. It was the work
of the willing lingers of some young
ladies at lloble, who also made sev
eral large cardinal Hags on which in
white cloth were the letters L. S.
J. U. The Hags were used on the lo
comotive of the special train and
were planted on tho field during the
game. Later wo wore presented,
as the intercollegiate champions of
the Pacifie coast, with a beautiful
banuor by a San Francisco lirm.
We suggest that these two banners
be hung in tho Encina reception
roQin where they will be objects of
interest to all and where no harm
will be dono to them. They are cer
tainly not tho property of any one
student.
All the young ladies of Stanford
were willing and ready to perform
little services on the occasion of the
last great game, and by their attend
ance at that gamo ami their hearty
enthusiasm aided very materially in
establishing tho success of intercol
legiate football on this coast.
We feel that only tho suggestion
is needed to have banners provided

when wo say our team ought to have
several banners, such as only femi
uine lingers can make. The U. C.
has four or five.
