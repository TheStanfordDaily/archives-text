Professor Barnard, the first ob
server of Jupiter's fifth moon, has
had to fight in a small way for the
priority of his discovery. Not only
has Mr. Cogloy, a Washington law
yer, claimed to have seen the satel
lite with a five-inch telescope, but a
clergyman has asserted that he liap.
done the same with an opera glass.
Professor Barnard has taken the
trouble to say that the newly found
body can barely be seen with the
great Lick glass, that it is invisible
in a twelve inch, and that the claims
of his would-be rivals are absurd.
A small star that has recently occu
pied a position in the heavons near
Jupiter was doubtless the cause of
the misapprehension of theamateurs.
