The course in English VIII., the
Art of Writing, given by Prof. La
throp, has been varied somewhat
by the requirement of a three to six
pnge story or essay to be handed in
every two weeks in addition to the
one page daily essay and the atten
dance upon two lectures a week.
Quite a number of the daily themes
written in this class have appeared
in the Sequoia under the name of
"Short Stories."
