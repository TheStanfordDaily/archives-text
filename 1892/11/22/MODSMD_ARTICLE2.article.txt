Tho geology students were enter
tained 1 .st evening by Dr. Brainier,
who gavo another talk on geology,
illustrating it by stereoplicon views,
lie confined his illustrations to the
famous Yellowstone Park. The first
view was of 'Liberty Cap," which is a
column of rock perhaps fifty feet in
height, formed by tho deposits of an
immense geyser which once existed.
As tho hot water rose and became
cooled by the air, it deposit* d min
erals which in time formed this pecu
liar shaped column.
Ho followed with views 011 the
Gardner river, showing ihe immense
geysers with similar deposits but
varying widely in form, some of them
forming immense cones, and others
making gigantic steps 011 Ihe side of
the canyon. Many of the cones
reach a height of fifty feet. In
Yellowstone Lake is one of those
cones whose top is part ially emerge d
affording a safo landing place for
more than a dozen men.
Some of the views showed where
deep gorges had been worn 111 the

cases JhouqaiulSj .of fedtxlejip ky â€žtlu>
action of the water for centuries.
The object of tho lecture was to
give students ideas as near as pos
sible to those obiaiued by actual
field work.
