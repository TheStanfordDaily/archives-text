Seen in tlio Exchange Columns.
This rematkablo bit of news con
cerning the L. S Jr. U. was first no
ticed in the /Silver unrf Gold of Houl
der, Colorado. Since then no less
than fifteen papers have clipped it
"The Leland Stanford Jr. Univer
sity has a cnnipns containing about
70,000 acres, with a drive way 17
miles long "
The following extract may explain
the existence of the above item in
its present state:
1 remember well 1113' first duties
on a college piper. I was ordered
to submit a few well choson, timely,
and spicy personal notes. One of
them was to this effect:
•J 01 e?, '!tl, is recovering from his illness.
Although I wan gratified soon af
ter to see these, my first words in
print, I was not blinded with con
ceit. I realized it was a good,
pointed note, and one that my friend
Jones would probably appreciate on
hi* recovery.
Judge of my surprise, however,
some days later to nee that, my re
mark had caught the eye of an ex
change and was already printed iu a
paper to whose editors and readers
the welfare of Jones could be of no
possible interest whatsoever.
I was amazed, but thought this
would Ue the end of my little note
of information. Not ho. Other col
lege papers all over the country, see
ing two allusions to the sickness of
Jones within a short space of time,
began to think that .Jones was a
person of no little importance.
For weeks afterwards I read de
tailed accounts of Jones' illness
How well I renumber those head
lines: ".Jones is still ill "J'oor
Joho-s- —",-"-Wi4l Jones ever-gel
well "That famous collegian
Jones, 'i >i ~dangerously sick," etc.
By this time, I began to think I
was a very popular writer. I con
cluded that thero must be some
thing fetchiug about my style. I
resolved to try again on a brief note
before starting a novel. J3y the way,
my information concerning Jones
had been given 1110 second-hand,
and I found out. some months later,
to my horror, that Jones had enjoyed
the best of health for several years
and he had merely been out of the
city during the time ho was unac
counted for.
My second famous note was pub
lished in the Spectator iu its original
i form as follows:
There are '2000 matriculated students
I at Columbia, thirty of whom are Yale
j graduates. Foolbail is very popular this
year, and very curiously six members of
the eleven come horn Indiana.
It is hardly necessary for mo to
do mor - than submit for inspection
some of the remarkable statements
which wore the offspring of this in
nocent remark. For six months, I
read them over and over again iu
tiic improved and revised additions
until my head grew dizzy Hero
are some of the extracts from the
exchanges of that time:
Ihtiltj I fustier, October 15th.
"There are '20,000 students at Columbia,

thirty of whom have played on the Yule
football team. The eleven will only play
in Indiana this year."
11 award Bamboo, October 17th.
"Columbia will play Yale this year wiih
over 200,000 men on her football team;
many of whom are matriculated Indians."
Tlio climax was reached in the fol
lowing note in the Yale Current-.
October 20th.
"Over 2,000,000 Indians came to Col
umbia this year to play football; they are
very popular and it, is hoped will soon
matriculate at Yale."
—Columbia Spectator.
