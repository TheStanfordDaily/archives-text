### 
It is not a month since the brass
band enthusiasts held a meeting and
decided tu organize a university
brass band That their efforts have
already been crosvned with success,
everyone who was honored with a
serenade last night will aver.
At about seven o'clock the boys
assembled in tho gymnasium, and
alter au hour's practice drove over
to Senator Stanford's residence.
The sweet strains of ihe "12ht ltogi
meut" soon roused the inmates, and
Mrs. Stanford with one or two others
appeared upon the veranda A hos
pitable invitation to go inside was
declined, as Senator Stanford had
already retired. Private Secretary
Nash thanked the boys for their
music, and on behalf of Senator and
Mrs. Stanford expressed their grati
fication at the enterprise of the stud
ents in organizing the baud.
ltoble was next visited, ami if
prolonged applause indicates any
thing, the visit was certainly a suc
cess. Alter playing in the quad
ranglc_tuul in .front of Enciua, --they
dispersed for the evening.
