At Princeton Harry Vincent, the
regular left-end and star player of
last year's eleven, told the Kcamimr
correspondent yesterday it was defi
nitely decided that he would not
play on Thanksgiving day. Vincent
Rfiid that Captain King had decided
to put Randolph in Vincent's place.
King seems to be confident, of suc
cess. He was greatly pleased with
the way Harvard was able to break
up Yale's interference and says
Princeton will destroy it. The
students are not at all confident ot
beating Vale. Few bets are being
made and those who have money are
asking odds of live and six to one.
The most betting is being made
on points. Some are willing to bet,
even money that Princeton will not
be beaten by over twenty points.
Que of the players said to-day that
in t-pite of all the loud talking he
can see no reason to hope for suc
cess. The two tackles are woefully
weak. Homan and Wheeler are in
poor form, not having played for
two weeks.
