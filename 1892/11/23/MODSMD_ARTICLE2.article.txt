# Yesterday's Practice Game.
## 
### 
Yesterday afterno >n a team fiom
the V. M. U. A ot han Jose played
a practice gamo with our eleven.
This wan the first time the Y. M.!.
A had lined up and but few of them
had ever seen a gamo before, so

there was but little doubt as to the
final outcome of the game. Snow
den, <x-'95, made Is is appearance
with the visitors, but did not play a
very steady game. The backs on
the San -To : -e team played foo f»ir
back of the line and every time they
attempted a run it, would be inter
cepted by the good tackling of
Frankenheimer and W. McLaine.
They introduced a new ]»lay in the
game very much like "snap the
whip." The first time it was work
ed it took our 1103 s by surprise and
quite a gain was made. But this
play seems unlawful for several
reasons; tho principal one being
that the men cannot take hold of
one another's hands when their side
has the ball.
But 0110 cannot expect to a
team p'ay first-class football which
has not, had the benefit of training,
a coach, and most of all, actual
practice on the field. No doubt
with time and practice the Y. M.
C. A. boys will produce a team
which will be no easy eleven to
conquer.
Mr. Gugel has organized this
team and has worked very hard to
get as good material as possible
together. Ho has picked out, sev
eral promising players who will, no
doubt, in time develop into first
el a'-s football men.
Tho score at the end was: Y. M.
0. A ,0; Stanford, 30.
