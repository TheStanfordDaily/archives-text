# Preparing for the Yale-Princeton Game.
## 
### 
Yale College never saw a more ex
traordinary scene than is furnished
to-niglit(Monda)) through the system
adopted for the sale of reserved seats
for tho Yale-Princeton game on Thurs
day. Only 1,500 reserved-seut tick
ets were sent to New Haven, and
each student will be allowed to take
live. The tickets are given out in
the order of lining up, and at the
distribution for the Harvard game
there were lileo scenes. The men
slept, in cbairs'all night, and at mid
night, there were two hundred men
in line. A good many students
slaved in lino all night with no
other purpose than to sell their
places, many of them getting $15.
This time this money making
scheme has spread and tho method
of selling has turned into a specula
tion on the part of a largo propor
tion of the applicants.
The salo begins to-morrow morn
ing at 10 o'clock. At 1:50 Monday
afternoon Phe'ps, '94, put a chair in
front of the "coop" door to wait
twenty-one and a half hours. Fif
teen minutes later two more took
their places, and they came in a
steady stream from then on, and at
5 o'clock there were 175 in line.
The first hundred were lucky
enough to get in the entiies of the
dormitory, the lino dividing tho
halls to tho top floor. Then it went
out of doors and at 8 o'clock nearly
200 were shivering in the freezing
night air. Inside, each man had an
easy chair, plenty of blankets, and
there were enough students' lamj s
and desks brought into the halls to
allow all to read and study.
Of the first seven men in line to
night five of them have no money
and no idea of buying tickets. They
are simply waiting to sell their
places to wealthy students who can
afford to pay a big bonus. Tho
poor holders will stay up all night
in tho cohl and purchasers of places
can take them to-morrow morning.
The first two men have sot. $40 as
their price, and the third found a
purchaser at $15.
Moflitt learned of this and dis
persed tho mob amid much hard
holing and strong language from
tho would-be money makers.
All the forenoon knots of men
stood around the "co-op store" wait
ing for the p'ace of sale to be an
nounced. It was kept secret until
tho issue of the Ynlr Daily News,
and a wild mob clambered for the
papers at one o'clock.
Tho first to get a copy yelled,"Two
o'clock at the co-op," and the cry
went the length of tho campus, |

bringing 200 men together in five
minutes. After much punching,
shoving, and ill temper a line was
formed and 250 men waited in tho
rain. The last man secured a grip
on his precious tivej; tickets at 4
o'clock. The supply just about half
equaled the demand, and many tick
ets were sold to-night for $5.
At Princeton a lot of eager stu
dents tumbled out of their bods
Monday night about 1 o'clock and
lined up in front of West College,
where tickets for the Yale-Princeton
game were advertised to bo put on
sale at 2 o'clock this afternoon.
Through tho long frosty night the
enthusiastic collegians roosted out
in the open air. Many had sofas
and leather chairs to recline upon.
Later in the fijht au enterprising
lot of students improvised a tent.
At nn early hour this morning 150
men were in line. Fifteen hundred
tickets for the grand stand were
sent down to Princeton. The fout
ball players and the faculty are al
lowed a limited choice of these be
fore the seats are put on sale. About
twelve hundred remain to he s dd to
the 1.100 students in tho college and
the townspeople. Some of the stu
dent; are said to have sold their
positions in lino to-day to wealthy
college mates.
From tVe enthusiasm of the past
week and the extraordinary scramble
for tickets to-day, it is apparent that
the reverses of the season have not
caused any diminution of interest in
tho final game Old men about here
say they have never icon the college
so full of football. It is the only
topic of conversation heard on the
campus, and will be for the remain
der of the week.
Yesterday's practice ended the
\\\ jk of tho Vale football eleven in
the field for tho seanon. Consider
able even money has been put up in
New Haven that Princaton will not
score, and two bets of $100 to HUIO
and $75 to $20 were made on the
result. The Yale eleven will play
just as they did at Springfield, with
Green away and Hinkey at tho ends;
Wallis and Winter, tackles; McCrea
and Hickok, guards; S:illm;in, cent
er; McOormick, quarter back; tho
IMiss brothers, halves; Butterworth,
full back. Tho men are in good
physical condition.
