Wiiy do not more of those intend-
bo journalists interest them
selves in the Daily Palo Alto or
the Sequoin? For the hitter we can
not speak but for the former we can
fity that positions on the staff are
always vacant. Applicants lor
positions are given a trial of two
weeks and if found competent are
added to the staff. As soon as any
show that their interest in tho wel
fare of the paper lags their names
are dropped. Assistant editors, 01
more properly reporters, for that is
what they are, get a very good idea
of what will be required of them, if
they ever report fora larger paper
They get a knack of discerning what
is news and they learn to write it
up in an intelligent style.

University extension has become
quite nn important, feature of modern
university work. It has for its ob
ject the spreading of the knowledge
of the schools and colleges among
a class of people who have not had
an opportunity to obtain a college
education and among thoso who
wish to keep in touch with the most
modern thought. The idea is a
good one and found by practical
application not to bo impractical.
Large numbers of people take this
work and receive good results. If
one of the chief features of this
work is to keep universities in touch
with the world, why can not univer
sity extension be made to work both
ways? A schemo, it might be term
ed university expansion, could bo
instituted by which men of business
and professional men could lecture
before our students and greatly to
the profit of these students. This
is done to some extent in placcs, but
is not so fully carried out as it
might bo. Robt. Ingersol frequent
ly speaks before assemblies of stud
ents, but it is not as the lawyer that
he appears to them so much as the
famous public man. There are in
San Francisco railroad men, bank
ers, lawyers, journalists, real estate
dealers, merchants, importers, man*
ufauluiurs. contractors, and men of
a score of other callings —intelligent
men, whose wide and varied exper
ience would mako their observations
valuable —who could be induced to

lecture here. The knowledge of
thee mon on economic and iocial
questions is often far in advance of
their times. The economic and
Social History of Now England, one
of the most valuable works in that
Ino published this century, written
by a woolen manufacturer, is only
one of many illustrations that might
be brought forward to show the
wealth of knowledge that not in
frequently is found in a practical
man of affairs. Now that tho de
partment of political science is be
ing divided up into so many differ
ent departments, it will become al
most necessary to institute some
regular plan of obtaining such
lecturers.
