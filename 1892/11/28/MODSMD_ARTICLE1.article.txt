# Stanford Men at Stockton
## 
### 
Last Wednesday the second
eleven left here to play the High
School football team at Stockton.
They left on the 2:10 train tor
San Francisco and there took the
steamer for Stockton.
The boys proceeded to make
themselves at home and it was not
long before music was heard on
deck. Several had brought
their mandolins or guitars and the
usually monotoneous trip was passed
very pleasantly.
When the team arrived at Stock
ton at 8 o'clock next morning, the
Stockton boys were there to greet
them. They did so with the Stan
ford yell, which they executed quite
creditably. The team was driven
to the Grand Central Hotel where
accomodations had been secured
After breakfast I>r. Wood took the
boys fora ride on the electric rail
way. The kite track was visited
and Stainboul was seen.
After this the boys were driven
about town in a coach which had
been tastefully decorated with car
dinal for the occasion. A coach in
blue and white followed, bearing
the Stockton High School team.
The town was fairly alive with
enthusiasm. There was not a per
son on the street who did not wear
colors of some kind, even the news
boys wore blue and white
After lunch the boys were driven
to Goodwater Grove where an au
dience of 1800 or 2000 were waiting
to see the long anticipated game of
football.
Game was called at 2:15. The
Stockton's won the toss and took
the ball, which they soon lost; our
men breaking through and tackling
behind the line.
When Stanford got the ball the
value of team work was soon mani
fes'ed. The boys worked together
remarkably well and did splendid
blocking.
Cochran scored the first touch
down and was followed by Lyons
and then bunt.
Gains of 20 yards for Stanford
were frequent occurences. Baker
made some good tackles for the
Stocktons. Grosh was hurt twice
during the half. The second time
he was taken from the field in a
dazed condition and bead better
took his place.
At the end of the half the score
was 20 to 0 in favor of Stanford,
"Whitehouse having kicked 2 goals.
The second half opened with the
ball in poseasion ol Stanford. A V
was formed and Lyons took t he ball.
Breaking through the point he did
not stop until he scored a touch down.

Then the bull was given lo the
Stockton's at. the center of the field.
They began with Harvards new
checker board trick. The ball wan
tossed to Baker who made quite a
gain.
After several goo<l runs the ball
crossed the line in the possession of
Butters and the first touch down
was made for the Sockton's. The
people fairly went wild, they shriek
ed themselves hoarse. Everybody
was satisfied, for the Stockton boys
had scored.
Another touch down waR scored
for Stanford by Lyons a?id the game
closed will) the score 32 to -1 in
favor of Stanford.
Lunt had a startling mishap.
When making a touch down he was
thrown against a scraper which had
been left on the grounds. He nar
rowly escaped striking his head on
the iron blade. As it was he came
out with an injured back.
These men constituted the teams:

In the evening the boys went to
the theatre party arranged by the
Stockton team at the Avon Theatre,
where the "Black Flag'' was play
ing. The anticipation of seeing the
students brought a large number of
people and it is needless to say the
house was crowded. The teams oc
cupied boxes on eaeh side of the
house.
The boys at once proceeded to
make things merry by blowing
liorns, giving their yells, etc. The
actors took it good naturedly and
seemed to enjoy it as much as their
audience.
