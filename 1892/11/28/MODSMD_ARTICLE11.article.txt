Thjs manner in which we are to
receive Walter Camp 011 his arrival
next Wednesday should be decided
on soon. It lias been suggested that
as many as possible go down to the
train and give him a good, enthusi
astic greeting. This would be better
than a more elaborate demonstra
tion. The matter should be taken
under consideration, and arrange
ments settled.
