The outcome of the Stanford-
Olympic game Inst Saturday wan
disappointing in the extreme, not
only to the team and management,
but to a large number of friends
who had gone to the city on pur
pose to witness the game. The
Olympics are entirely to blamo in
the matter. On Friday night a
telegram came to Palo Alto stating
that the grounds at Central Park
were flooded and that it would be
unadvisable to go on with the game.
A message was sent back immedi
ately to the effect, that it was too
late to postpone the game and that
Stanford team would be in the city
to play, rain or shine. But instead
of making further preparations for
the morrow, tho Olympics hustled
off to the Chronicle and, on no
authority whatever from Stanford,
had a notice of postponement put
in the paper. Not a word of what,
was being done was sent to our man
agement. As a consequence our
team and friends went to San Fran
cisco Saturday morning expecting
nothing else than that the game
would come ofl\ The rest is known
â€”how the Olympics refused to get
any sort of a team in tho field, even
fora practice game. Their men
were in the city all right, and the
simple reason why they failed to
show up was this: They were fear
ful of defeat from the fact that prac

ninny festivities indulged in during
Thanksgiving week. Thus the
Stanford management entailed a
large amount of trouble and ex
pense just because mattirs did not
work exactly to suit the Olympic
club. Next time our team j lay the
Olympics a forfeit should be put up.
