Tho Olympic-Stanford Game.
The first eleven went to San
Francisco Saturday morning to play
the Olympics. On their arrival they
found the Olympic team had de
cided not to play. The grounds
were in perfect condition and the
day an excellent one for football.
The only excuse the Olympics would
give was that some of their men
were out of the city and a team
could not, probably be gotten to
gether. The true reason for their
failure lo play is explained in an
other column. In the afternoon our
team lined up, made a touch down,
and kicked goal, Referee Porter giv
ing the game to Stanford 6 0
through default. The part of the
affair to be most regretted was the
large crowd of people, mostly Stan
ford supporters, who had come to
see the game and were disappointed.
