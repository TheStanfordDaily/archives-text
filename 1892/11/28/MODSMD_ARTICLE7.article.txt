# Popular Concerts.
## 
### 
Music has been struggling very
bard to have things lier own way.
The subscription list for the first
of the series of popular concerts has
been assiduously and persistently
circulated aud yet it is scarcely half
filled.
To persons fortunate enough to
have heard the artists, the names of
Miss Carrmichael - Oarr, Messrs.
Donald de V. Graham, Sigmund
Heel and Louis Heine, look very al
luring in print, They have always
drawn great audiences in San Fran
cisco. If the engagement of them
is not consumated, it will not be a
fault imputable to those in charge
of the matter. It is a fact that the
dream of a series of first-class
concerts at popular prices will re
main a dream, unless each student
takes the matter in baud and sub
sciibes his name to the guarantee list
in the Registrar's office.
