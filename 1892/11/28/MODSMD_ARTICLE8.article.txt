### 
Within llie atmosphere of higher
culture which has descended upon
Palo Alto, we are apt. to forget that
one of America's most famous stock
fauns is close at hand. The library
is indebted to Mr. Ariel Lathrop for
a copy, luxuriously bound in full
morroco, of the tenth annual cata
logue of the l\ilo Alto stock farm.
Visitors to the stock farm may
now consult this volume for the
records of the many great trotters
which have, at one time or another,
been domiciled there; ami may scan
also the list of one hundred and
eighteen famous sons ami daughters
of ' Electioneer," who have each
trotted a mile in less thnn 2:30.
