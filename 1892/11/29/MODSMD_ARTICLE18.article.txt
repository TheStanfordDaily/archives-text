The boat club men are working
in earnest. Last evening a meeting
was lieM in room 0!5 Encina.
The men are nnxious to see
things move rapidly. Accordingly
a committee has been appointed to
investigate the cost of, anil to draw
np plans fora large boat house to
be built on the lake above the Uni
versity.
The boat house will 1Â»h at least
sixty feet long in order to accomo
date the eight oared racing barge,
and will be amply wide enough to
afford accomodations for pleasure
boats owned by members.
The barge will be obtained as
soon as possible. If one cannot be
built in time, one already made will
bo bought, there being several dis
banded boat, clubs in the state from
which the required boat could be
purchased at a comparatively small
figure.
Seventeen new names were pro
posed at Ihe meeting, and if these
are accepted the club will have al
most, fifty members.
Spaulding, '00, was elected treas
urer.
The next meeting will be held in
one of the rooms in the quadrangle
next Thursday evening. It is hoped
that Professor Smith, who pulled an
oar on one of Cornell's crack crews,
will then bo present and will give
the men somo advice on the sub
ject.
