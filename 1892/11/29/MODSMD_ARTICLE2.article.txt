# Edmund Russell's Lecture.
## 
### 
Mr. llussell spoke last night upon
the varied--positions of the head in
their relation to and expression of
tiic different, feelings. The latter
part of his lecture was devoted to
readings from Rossel.fi and Swin
burne, at.d to several recitations
from these two poets. 'J ho main
theme of his lecture, however, was
Art Criticism.
There are nine distinct positions
of the head which express distinct,
emotion. The forward bend with
eyes cast down denotes thought; the
head thrown far back, ecstasy; the
normal position of eyes and head, in
difference; the head tilted to one
side and slightly raised, thought
away from the object looked at; the
head to 0110 side and slightly low
ered, thought on object in view; the
head slightly back of normal posi
tion, pride; the head bent forward
and eyes slightly raised, sympathy
and attention; the head on one side
and lowered with eyes slightly
turned, suspicion; the head Ihiown
back and turned to one side with
the glance directed upward over the
shoulder, coquetry.

Speaking of art, Mr. Russell said
that we never liud a natural head
expression in photography. In all
beautiful expressions the head and
eyes are turned in the same direction;
in coarse, vulgar, and sensuous ex
pressions the head and eyes are
turned in opposite directions Art
deals with truths, not with facts; it
works on broader lines than a mo
mentary feeling.
His definition of realistic art, with
which he lias no sympathy, is "the
well-doing of the things that are not
worth doing." Lack of expression
in art is caused from too much copy
ing of plaster casts and models ; n
the studio. The great artists seldom
come from art, schools where nothing
is created, but where everything is
copied. Bossetti, at the head of the
school of creative art in Europe,
broke awav from old styles, and ere
atrd artistic designs which caused
the great aesthetic movement in art
circles that has given us such beauti
ful decorations. To Bossetti we owe
a great deal of our modern civiliza
tion and beauty He is Byzantine,
oriental in his taste and spirit; Swin
burne ir. Greek in spirit.
The next lecture will boon "Home
Decoration," and will not be given
until two weeks from next Monday
night. The last lecture of the course
will be uiven one week after.
