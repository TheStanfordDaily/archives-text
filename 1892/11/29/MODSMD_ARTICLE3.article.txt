						Few Words About Bulletin Boards.
## 
### 
At, oilier univemties tlie bulletin
board is one of Iho attractions of the
campus. The students visit it daily
to sco what"is - new." The matter'of
making our bulletin boards, espec
ially the large black one near the
entrance to the quadrangle, more
attractive and move serviceable has
been mentioned several times in
these columns with more or leas
favorable results. We now propose
that the light, hand half of the large;
black board be reserved for notices
to Ito written in chalk, important
notices which must appear in large
letters, letters to.» huge for ordinary
paper —such notices as a meeting of
the Associated Students, a football
or baseball game, a lecture, or any
other announcement intended for
the eye of every student —in fact,
notices that will be noticed. The
remaining half of the board will be
found sufliitiently huge euongh for
all the pera|er notices, provided a
little cure is observed in economiz
ing space by placing them close to
gether and by temoving such as
have served their purpose. We
shall endeavor to see that an eraser
and a receptacle forJJ chalk are pro
vided tor this board.
