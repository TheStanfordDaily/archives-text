# MR. PORTER'S FOURTH FOOTBALL LETTER.
## The
						Fullback and the Halves. 
### 
The lull back needs to he ;i strang
er to "rattles." It requires the
coolest of cool heads, the keenest of
perceptions, and the quickest action
lo aland and receive the hall with a
lot ot beefy rushers coming down
full tilt; and then to send it sailing
back by a well placed punt, when
the next moment one knows he is to
be bowled over. I suppose that
there is no position on the team
quite so hard to (ill this. In
choosinga full back a captain should,
unless he has an experienced man,
look fora sure, hard tackier. A man
can be taught much more easily to
kick and drive through the line than
to tackle; and his daily practice
should still hi- in tackling through
interference as well as kicking.
Though long kicks are good; :i long
kick poorly placed is not. nearly so
effective as a shorter kick well placed.
But above nil let the full hick prac
tice catching punts till he absolutely
never fumbles. If there is anything 1
that so demoralizes a team as to see
the opponents gain 40 or 50 yards
by a fumbled punt it bus not been
announced. And Ihe drop kick —
here is a most effective means of
scoring that, is altogether too lightly
looked upon. Let your full prac
tise till he is sure, or reasonably sure,
to make bis kick at 30 yards; don't
try him at fancy distances and make
grand si and misses that come "so
close," but let him be so suie of his
kick that you need not give U|> the
ball on the fourth down when you
are '20 yards away. Suppose the
kick fails and the ball comes out; is
not the chance worth the risk? Let
your full, first of all, be a good
tackier, cool and clear headed
Then make him practice at placing
his kicks. In a practice game let
him know each time just about
where you want, the ball to go, and
later he will be able to place the
hall to the best advantage. Of
course any advice for the imining
of backs npplies to the nil as well
as the halves.
With the lull brffck the halves are
the principal means of ofi'enne, al
though most capfi.ins are now using
almost every man in the line to le
lieve the backs; and the sharpness
of modern defense has made this
necessaiy, as there are few backs
that could stand the strain, unaided
by the forwards, through a full
game. The first thing that a run
ning back must learn is to start
quickly and get into speed immedi
ately; in order to do this thore must

lie constant, practice in taking the
hall at full speed, if a back has any
tendency to fumble it makes him
hesitate at the start or fiiil to get. up
speed till he has the ball. Such a
back will fr< queut Iy l»e downed with
loss of ground, while a back who
can get up liis speed immediately
seldom fails to gain and is less often
downed fora h km. Slow starting is
more often attributable t> a fear of
fumbling than to any other cause.
I would advise I In; hacks to get to
gether at lunch time and dining
spare moments to practice taking
the ball on the run, gradually mak
ing the passes harder aud the run
ning swifter.
Those odd moments of practice,
by tho way, are of value that no one
appreciates till the season is gone
and an account of stock taken. And
i.hen many a little point that helped
lit a critical moment c:in be traced
to the odd moments in the morning.
Tin-re is tlie personal equation that
must be determined by each player
for himself, and us no two men play
exactly tho same game it dots not
pay any one to model his play after
another player be he ever so skill
ful. The more personality one can
put into the game, provided he vio
lates n me of the laws of the game,
the more difficult his game will be to
meet. Ames' work was marked by
a personality that made him famous,
and Donnelley's style of play, while
remarkably clever and effective, has
never been imitated. And from all
accounts Yale's star, llinkey, is an
remarkable as cither of the I'rince
timians for the same valuable but
rare quality. At Harvard Dean and
Perry TralTord each had a way of his
own, and Marshall Newell is a puz
zling customer on account of his
original methods, which have hin
opponents all at sea as to what is
coming next. However, none of
them ever violated any of tho can
ons of the game. Tho seeming dif
ference between t heir play aud that
of ihe average is merely a matter of
personality. It any man has an
idea let him try it in practice; if it is
a failure he will soon hear from the
coacher or captain.
