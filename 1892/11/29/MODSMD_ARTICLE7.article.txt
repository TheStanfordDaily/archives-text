If anything is to he done this
semester in regard to a Stanford
button or a Stanford pin it is about
time the Associated Students met
and considered the matter. The
U. C.-Stanford football game, now
definitely set for the 17th of Decem
ber, would be a good occasion on
which to sport a Stanford button or
pin. The Christmas vacation would
be another very agreeable time lo
wear such a token, particularly as
niost of us go home at that time.
Two very unique designs have been
suggested. Many others hardly
worthy of notice have boen sug
gested also. One of the two best
designs is a small pin with a mina
ture flagpole and streaming pennant
on which, in silver letters, is the
word Stanford, the background of
the pennant being of cardinal
enamel. The other is a button
about the size of a dime. It has a
background of cardinal enamel, and
in slight relief at, the centre is a
fac-similo of the Palo Alto tree in
gold, Roth of these designs cost
$1.75 to $2 25 each, according to the
purity of the metal used for the
back of the enamel, etc.
