Some time Mrs. Stanford was
present at one of our weekly lec
tures in the chapel and requested
that, tho stadents—there were nearly
six hundred present—sing some
college song before the lecture be
gan. We sang: but how modest we
were; how fearful lest we should
hear our own voices. One small
school room full of primary schol
ars could have rendered that song
with more vigor and could have
mado a greater sound. But may bo
the frightened looks that so many
students cast at each other were
not caused by their natural bashful
ness, which prevented them from
complying with Mrs. Stanford's re
quest, but were caused rather from
lack of confidence in their ability
at least to join in the great chorus
of voices where their slight mistakes
might not be noticed, but where
their good will and enthusiasm
certainly would be. The idea of
proceeding the Tuesday night lec
ture by some college song is a good
one. Tho fact that Mrs. Stanford
first suggested it should recommend

it favorably 1o the student body.
But in addition it enlivens matters;
it piitH the students in an agreeable
humor. The true zest and enthu
siasm of college life is brought out
in a college song in which a large
number of students take pait. This
matter suggests the yell. That is a
thing that everyone can engage in.
We suggest that the students give
one or several Stanford yells when
they have issued into tho arcade
after a lecture. By this means we
will learn to yell in unison and to
give our yell in the best possible
manner. Such a custom was ob
served last year. Why not continue
it?
