Evkrv Stanford student should
learn that the Stanford color is
Cardinal and should display that
color alone at the great game. it
is annoying to see Stanford sym
pathizers wear a shade of red that is
decidedly oil" color and wave it lor
cardinal, but when our fellow stud
ents, in seeming disregard for all
harmony and union among the
Stanford ranks at a game, war and
wave every shade from a dark pink
to a maroon, it is decidedly pro
voking.
