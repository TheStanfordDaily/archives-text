# PROF. BARNARD'S LECTURE.
## Recent Astronomical Discoveries. 
### 
List uight's lecture was probably
one of the moat interesting Fcientilic
lectures ever delivered here, and
simply because the lecturer avoided
technical phrases. "He introduced
tho lecture proper by a description
of a spectroscope and ils valuable
use in astronomy to determine the
composition of distant stars and
tho direction of their movements.
Several charts were shown illustrat
ing tho spectra of various stars, and
the presence of the dark lines and
the colored bands in each spectrum
was briefly explained. He dwelt
very particularly upon the im
portance and value of photography
in the science of astronomy.
Speaking of the recently dis
covered comet, he said he does nut,
believe it has any connection with
Bela's comet, the latter having be
come scattered and lost in space.
Alter other brief explanations
which were necessary in ord.r to
give every one a little elementary
knowledge on the subject of astron
omy and the manner in which stel
lar measurements are made by
means of tho paralyx, eclipses, tran
sits over tha sun's disc, ete., h e
proceeded to explain the large steri
opticau views that were cast upon
the screen.
A snow scene 011 Mt. Hamilton,
the location of the great Lick Ob
servatory, was used to illustrate tho
shadows ou the moon. Little
mountain like drifts of pure white
snow with dark shadows on the side
away from the sun's light were com
pared to the mountains on the moon
and their dark shadows on tho
plains and mountain sides not in
the sun's light. A very beautiful
and grand cloud scene in winter
time from the top of Mt. Hamilton
was shown next â€”a great, rolling
sea of white, billow}' clouds, looking
like a grand ocean storm. Then
there was a night scene of San Jose
down in the valley, fifteen miles
away, with only its scores of elec
tric lights showing in the darkness
while a new moon shone above. It
took an exposure of several hours,
as it did in most of the views of
stars shown later, to obtain this
picture. The corona of the sun dur
ing an eclipse and various sun spots
were shown in other pictures. There
is thought to he some connection
between the advent of these peri
odic and constantly changing spots
011 the sun and the magnetism of
the earth, auroras and other mag
netic m inifestations being exhibited
011 the earth at the same time.

There were a photograph and two
drawings of Mars made at his last
opposition, showing his peculiar
lines, which have been without
reason supposed to be great canals;
there being as yet no knowledge as
to whether the dark places on Mar's
surface are water or land A pic
ture of Jupiter showed that planet
to be enveloped in dense clouds,
caused by the condensation of watery
vapor rising from the water on its
surface by reason of the great heat
of the planet.
Jupiter fora long time was sup
posed to have but four moons, but
it has boon discovered recently, by
means of the great Lick telescope,
that if, has a fifth moon, a very small
one, which revolves about it with
great velocity, at a distance of only
half Jupiter's diameter from the
surface of that planet.
Temporary stars, such as appear
suddenly in the heavens and are'
seen fora few nights and then dis
appear, were spoken of. Saturn's
rings were shown, and the opinion
was ventured that they are count
less small moons. Several views of
different, cornets, varying in size and
shape, were thrown upon the screen.
The moon, its volcanic and moun
tainous suifaco, its groat craters
and valleys, were plainly illustrated
by quite a number oi' very fine
views.
The original plate, showing a hit
of the milky way, where a faint
glow first attracted Prof. Barnard's
attention, and later developed into
the first comet to be discovered by
the aid of the cameia, was very in
teresting. Photogiapbs of nebulae,
and bits of the milky way, its count
less myriads of suns, many ot which
are a million miles in diameter,
were displayed.
The existence of several new stars,
which could not be discovered with
the telescope alone, has been
brought to light, by tlrn photograph.
