# Walter Camp to Arrive To-Day.
## 
### 
Manager Champlin last, night re
ceived a dispatch from Walter Camp
sent from YVinnenmcca, Nev., saying
that he expected to arrive in Oak
land this morning at 10:30. The
trains across the mountains arc run
ning very irregularly of late owing
to the storms, and it is possible that
the overland will not arrive until
somewhat later in tho day. He is
accompanied by McOlung, and the
two will be entertained by the Yale
alumni at the University Club this
evening.
Mr Champlin and Dr. Wood went
to San Francisco this morning to
meet Mr. Camp, and if possible, to
bring him to Palo Alto this after
noon. The lateness of his arrival
will probably prevent this, and in
that case he will probably come down
to Palo Alto on some train to-morrow
morning. It was the original inten
tion of the students to go to the
train in a body, but the weather will
prevent, this. If notice is given in
time, there will be a large number
of students who will welcome Mr.
Camp in the quadrangle.
