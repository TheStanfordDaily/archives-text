# Another Player Hurt.
## 
### 
Lunt, '96, received a very painful
and perhaps serious injury on the
football field last night. The team
lined up in the mud and attempted
to play but the ground was so slip
pery that tho players could hardly
keep their feet. In one of the
scrimmages Lunt was hurt and on
examination it was found that his
knee was dislocated. The injury
was very painful and was done in
such a way as to make it serioun.
Of course this prevents his playing
on the team again this j-ear. The
team can ill afford to lose such a
player. This is his first year 011 the
team but, he has shown himself a
strong and good full back. With
both Jones and Lunt injured the
available full back material is used
up and some new man will have to
be trained for the position.
