# The
						Storm.

### 
The heaviest rain ami wind storm
that lias been known in the Santa
Clara Valley lor several years began
last Saturday and continued with
increasing violence till now. Several
small frame buildings and sheds in
the vicinity have been blown down.
In many places the roads are im
passable. The students who are
compelled to live in Mayfield and
Pato Alto are the greatest sufferers,
as many of them are obliged to walk
the distance of a mile or more
through the rain and mud. A num
ber of them have taken rooms tern

porarily in the dormatories, and
without doubt more will follow to
morrow until the halls are full. The
football fteld is flooded and the
learn will be obliged to lose several
days practice on that. account.
Home of the men appeared on the
field last night and made an attempt
to practice but it ended in a failure.
The enthusiasts look apprehensive
and feel that with eaeh day's rain the
chances for December 17th grow
less.
