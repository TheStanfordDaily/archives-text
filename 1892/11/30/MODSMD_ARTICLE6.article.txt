# Trains Delayed.
## 
### 
The train leaving San Francisco at
seven o'clock in the morning was
throe hours behind time this morn
ing. Several telegraph poles and
trees were blown across the track,
and it was necessary for the brake
men and fireman to go out during
the storm and chop these tr es in
pieces before the track could be
cleared. Instructors Duque and Grau
were unable to meet their classes the
first two hours. The train was due
at 8:25 and did not arrive till 11:10.
