It is a delicate thing to speak
of tho management of the dormitor
ies in these columns. The Sau
Francisco newspapers have too of
ten shown the readiness to seize
upon small points and give the Stan
ford University a very undesirable
notoriety. An unguarded but in
nocently intended statement here
might form the basis of several col
umns of sensational trash in the San
Francisco papers which would do
anything but gain the favor of the
public. That something ought to
be said by this paper is but justice
to the students we represent.
It can be said, greatly to the cred
it of the students, that to whatever
inconvenience or unreasonable ex
penso they have been subjected,
they have acted with patience and
good senfe. It argues well for them
and the result will be the raising
tho personnel of the University. T1 e
management of tho dormitories at
tho first of last year was extremely
unsatisfactory, but later it grew
somewhat better. The moderate
juice paid for board and lodging
might, have been construed into an
excuse for the inferior fable, but
those acquainted with such affairs
suy not. But, if tho blameworthy
management did exist, Inst year it
was most, certainly ushered in with
the present semester when the price
of living was raistd fifty per cent
without the slightest improvement
in any way. There was added to
this the requisition that each stud
ent must, furnish bedding, towels,
napkins, etc. and provide for laun
dry of the same. For some it was
an impossib lity to submit to these
regulations; and expedients, such as
Jiviug in adjoining towns, were re
sorted to. Others took quarters in
tho halls, waiting iill such a time a*
they could do b Iter. All hoped
and confidently expected that the
return of Senator Stanford would
bring an entire readjustment of af
fairs. Everyone understood that
neither the President of the Uni
versity nor any member of the fac
ulty had any more power to change
the state of affairs than he himself.
The return of Senator and Mrs.
Stanford was so frequently spoken
of that it came to symbolize a rem
edy of existing evils, aud when the
students went to the Stanford man
sion to pay their respects to our
founders they felt inwardly a
warmer welcome than was ever sus
pect< d by any one.
Senator and Mrs. Stanford have
been at Falo Alto now for over a
month and there is no change nor
any sign of one. For some of us
tho outlook is not pleatant, for
others it has a graver signifiancc.
From an institution where the poor
student was to have a chance for an
education this has grown to be a
university where the student of
moderate means must figure care

fully t,o make both ends meet. This
need not be as it i°, and aw a proof,
one need only to t ike a glance at
what it costs to live in other col
leges. In Yale nnd Harvard the
exj ense of tho "commons" (stud
ents' dining room) is divided
equally among the boarders. A re
cent, report, shows that 11 jo weekly
cost to cach student is from $:$.. r i() to
$•4.00 at Yale and from $3.75 to
$4.25 at Harvard The students at
Ann Arbor pay from $2.50 to 00
for board aud from $1 25 to $2.50
per week for rooms. Inquiries
have been made in San Jose and it
is found that board and rooms are
obtained from private families at a
rate ranging from $18.00 to $25.00.
At Berkeley two-thirds of the stmi
nuts living in private families pay
$25.00 per month, while those liv
ing in club houses pay from $3.00
to $0.00 less than thi.s. These fig
ures will speak for themselves, but
an examination into them makes tho
case in hand even worse. The Yale
and Harvard commons do not aim
at economy. The table service is
better than that of the average
hotel, and that the board is desir
able is evident from the largo num
her of standing applications for ad
mission. The difference between
the price of boarding in private
families and that, in our dormitories
is the one which will occasion the
most surpri-e. All provi-ions,
groceries, and other articles of con
sumption used in the kitchen and
dining rooms, when bought in such
quantities as wo use them, are fur
nished at wholesale rates, which
|
means a reduction of from five to
fifty per cent,, from the rates charged !
to private families, nnd yet the J
price of our board is from ten to
fifty per cent, higher that that
charged by such private families.
The provisions bought are of the
most inexpensive sort. 'I he sub
siitution of student service by that
of .lapanese reduces the cost of
servants to a minimum. There is,
practically, no laundry expense, as
each student pajs for this item
himself. The grossest mismanage
ment could not use up tho entire in
come of Boble ami Encina halls
with no more to show for it. What
is the conclusion? Any one can
draw it.
A very important secret of state
leaked out some months ngo when
an application was sent in by a San
Francisco party to lease b'oble Hall
and conduct if, as a boarding house.
The applicants were astounded
when informed that they would be
charged $700 011 per month for heat
and light. It then became known
that the and heat of all the
buildings in the quadrangle were
charged to the dormitories. If such
a regulation is not on the faco of it,
a rank injustice, it will become smell
on examination. It, is set. down as
a theory that the University has
nothing to do with the running of
tho dormitories. Again, it is to be
questioned whether such an item
should lie charged to students, but
granted that it should, why would
it not be more consistent to impos*-
upon each entering student an in
cidental fee covering the cost <112
lighting and heating ? In this way
725 students in the University who
have tlie benefit of the warmed and
lighted quadrangle would pay for it,
while now that expenso is borne by
the 27;') students Jiving in the dorm
itories. No comments are necessary
on this. It speaks for itself.
Why dont you live in May field,
Menlo Park, Palo Alto, or Sau Jose?
someone says. That strikes at the
heart of the matter. If we could
act on that suggestion the halls
would close and this editorial be un
written. That we cannot do it has
been clearly demonstrated. But
why? The reason is that a majority
of the students have too much col
lege work to do to think of dissi
pating their energies 1>3 T living at
such n distance from the buildings,
and tlie distances are by no means:
easy. Students who attempt to do
any athletic or other outside work
with their studies tind that they
have no other choice but to go into
the dormatories.
In writing the above we have at
tempted to state in as clear and uu
enipassioned siyle as possible the
view which the entire student body
hold upon the subject. We do not
wish to find fault, but ask that
simple justice be done. In saying
this much we have done it with the
most profound respect for our
founders and the greatest loyally to
the University which bears their
name. It need not be stated here
that, no blame for the existing state
ot affairs can be attached to the
President, Dr. Jordan, nor with the
professors associated with him.
Could earnest endeavor av.iil any
thing the efforts of the President
and faculty would have altered the
state of affairs long ago. They have
worked unceasingly in our behalf,
and that what they have done is
appreciated is evident by the laud
able actions of the students.
