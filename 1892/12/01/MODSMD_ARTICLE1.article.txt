# Walter Camp at Palo Alto.
## Arrival of Yale's Great Football Coach. What He Expects To Do with the Stanford Eleven in Preparing It for the Annual Contest. 
### 
As wan stated in the Daily Palo
Alto of yesterday, Mr. Walter Camp
arrived in San Francisco yesterday,
and came to Palo Alto this morning.
He was accompanied by tlio not less
famous Captain McClung, who is
also of Yale, and who will coach the
University of California eleven. Mr.
Camp is at present nu occupant, of
room (>, Encina Hall, and dines at
the training table with the team.
It will interest all the students to
know some of tho plans which Mr.
Camp has in view for the team. In
view of this, a representative of tho
Daily Palo At,to called on him this
morning and requested an interview.
Mr. Camp, Mr. McClung and Mr.
Hefflefinger, started for the Pacific
coast the day after tho Yale-Prinee
ton game. Mrs. Camp, who, like
her husband, is a great football en
thusiast, was prevented from ac
companying her husband on ac
count of her mother's illness. In
an interview, Mr. Camp spoke in
very enthusiastic terms of his own
and Mr. McClung's college days.
Tney were both New Haven men
and have lived about Yale since
their graduation. In college they
were both members of the 1) K. E.
fraternity and the Scull and Bones.
After graduation Mr. Camp became
an officer in the New Haven Clock
Company, which office he still holds.
Concerning the game lie Â«ail in
substance tho following :
"In the oast football is growing
in importance every year. It is sup
ported by the very best class of poo
aud does not share with baseball
that, professional tinge which spoils
any game. I have been an enthu
siast in it since it was first
played as a college game and the
growth of its popularity may be
measured by the fact that in '7(! a
contest was attended by 500 or GOO
whereas the most recent games were
witnessed by 25,000 and 30,000 In
coining to the Pacific const >lr Mo-
Thing and myself are endeavoring to
help in the progress of the great
amateur game. Of course I know
nothing of tho game played here
except what I have seen in news
paper accounts, but from all I can
h am, you play better ball here than
teams in the cast, which Irnve had no

more practice. From the intelligent
questions of the men here I think
the players understand the principles
of the game better than did Vale . r >
or (i years ago. I am pleasantly
surprised to find that you are play
ing many of the most recent devices
and modes of strategy.
"Much can be done in two weeks
in coaching a team, provided the
men are in good condition, as your
team seems fo be. I can correct
many errors of individual players,
and give a good deal of assistance to
the team work. My idea in coming
out, is not so much to coach for any
particular game as to lay a better
foundation for future work. Of
course much of my work will be de
termined by what has already been
done. 1 shall go out on the field
this afternoon and watch the men
play. After to-day I shall begin a
course of systematic instruction and
discipline."
Here Mr. Camp smiled and ox
pressed a hope that none of the
players are s. nsitive to sharp rebuke
on llie field, for il. is the position of
the coach to correct errors on the
field in a manner to leave an im
pression on the player corrected.
On the ethics of the game he ex
pressed himself as one who feels
deeply 011 the subject. He is
great enemy to anything like illegit
imate playing, or playing with any
unfair advantage. The instruction
to our men will have the one central
thought, tl.at, the fair game is the
ono that wins.
Work under Mr. Camp will begin
al, once The backs will receive
ppecial instruction at home conveni
ent time early in the day, and the
entire team will practice as usual.
It, is expected that an increased num
ber of spectators will watch the prac
tice each evening.
