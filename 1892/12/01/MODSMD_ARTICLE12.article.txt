It seems very strange that, the
gate near I>i\ Jordan's house is
kept locked during the rainy
weather. Jiy this proceeding all
the 1 nines from Maylield are coni
nellnd lo lake a round about way
through the heavy, muddy roads,
when they could just as well have
the use of the short, cut with good
macadamized road on the way to

the quadrangle. It is no uncom
mon thing to see il.o Mijlield bus
stuck tust. two or three times a day.
If permission were granted to pass
through the gate, a great inconven
ience to tlio students who reside in
field would be removed.
