When is the University at Chi
cago to have its commencement da)?
It is understood that men and
women may present themselves for
examination for degrees and for
graduation at four dilt'ent times of
the year. By a vote of hoard of
trustees tal<en 011 Tuesday last, it
was decided to hold what shall be
called a University Convocation, on
the first evening of every quarter.
At this meeting, which will be an
official meeting of the university,
degrees will he conferred, honors
will bo bestowed, announcements of
fellowships and scholarships and of
new members of the faculty will be
made. The fir t University con
vocation will he held on the fecond
day uf January, I85K). It will not
bo, I take it, the custom of the
university to have addresses by
those who aro graduating, but
rather an address by some person
not in residence at the university,
on some theme of general interest.
