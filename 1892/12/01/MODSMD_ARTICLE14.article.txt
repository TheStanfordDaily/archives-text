There is a movement on foot at
Williams toward obtaining the con
sent of the faculty to make scientific
students eligible to elctiou to the
I'lii Beta Kappa Society. This action
is because of ihe recent, great im
provement in Ihe scientific course of
the college, which has put it on an
equality with the best science schools
in the country.
The presidents of the Yale and
Harvard Debating Unions, respect
ively, met at Springfield last Satur
day and made arrangements fora
joint debate between the two col
leges, which will take place at Cam
bridge on January 18; li. The ques
tion of debate will be: "Resolved,
That the power of the railroad cor
porations in the United States should
be further limited by nat ional legis
lation." Harvard will be allowed
the choice of sides.
The dates for the one hundredth
anniversary of the founding of Wil
liams College were set for Oct. 8, J),
and 10, 1893. President Cleveland
will be present, and many collegiate
and governmental dignitaries.
The religious census of the Uni

Having subsidized the college cor
respondents of the press, Yale lias
now settled down to good, hard
woik on her team. Reports of dis
abled players and discouraging pros
pects continue to be sent regularly
from New Haven, but the recupera
tive powers of the men are nothing
short of marvelous, as they may be
found in their usual position at any
important match. 1 discover myself
at times wondering if the corres
pondent at New Haven ever sleeps,
tor if a football man bangs his head
against a bedpost, or stumbles over
a stick or a stone, the fact is duly
chroniclid in the columns of the
morning papers along with a dolor
gus wail over the prospects of the
season. The loss of llelfelfinger and
Moriison is a stock lament that has
not even yet been exhausted, whili
the panegyrics on McClung would
make a Sunday edition of any
blanket sheet, Yale pays at reasurer
to tnke cnre of her athletic moneys;
she might also economize by consol
idating her correspondents into a
press bureau with hospital attach
ment. —N. V. livening Post.
