# The 						Boat Club.
## 
### 
It has been hinted that many of
the young ladies at Rob'eare already
interested in the new boat club.
There is no reason why they should
not be, for rowing is a healthful
pleasure that can be enjoyed by all.
It should receive just as much atten
tion from the yoing ns lawn
tennis, and perhaps more, for it is
an exercise that promotes physical
development perhaps more per
fectly than any other one athletic
sport.
In the eastern states the ladies are
quite prominently connected with
aquatic sports. Many clubs have
lady members, and have good oars
men among them. Canoeing also
receives attenti on. Many ladies have
canoes of their own. The seaman
ship they display in guiding their
crafts is startling, and the dexterity
with which they handle a paddle
would astonish a Indian chief.
It is earnestly hoped the young
ladies will retain their interest in the
boat club, and become members if
possible.
