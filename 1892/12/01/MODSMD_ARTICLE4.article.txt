# MR. PORTER'S FIFTH FOOTBALL LETTER.
## Interference and Tackling. 
### 
How to offer good interference
n.n<l how to take advantage of the
interference when carrying the ball
are things that must be practiced
daily till Iho ]>l;iy has a method and
go that i.s irresistable. Don't bump
the tackier aside —upset him every
time— he is out, of mischief while on
the ground. In interfering stay
with your runner, don't spread away
from him, remember the closer you
are to liim without getting in his wa}'
the more protection you'offer him. Get
your shoulder into an opponent first
or he will drive you into your own
runner and stop him with your aid.
It is a very hard matter to determine
just Iho moment when anxiety to
meet the aggressor will draw the in
terferer away front the runner, while
to wait till the opponent does the
bumping means usually the stopping
of the runner. This is another
point that can bo gained only by
constant, practice and it would be
well for captains and coaches to
watch the interference closely and
insist, on proper work. As to the
runner, he must use his head; and it
is a delicate point when to dodge
out from one interferer aud to come
closer to another; the shadings of
seconds in a case like that are mo
mentous. It is in such a situation
that the heady player wins and that
the results of patient coaching and
constant practice becomes apparent.
Another point that is much lost
sight of is the disguising of plays.
Too often the set positions of the
backs determines for the enemy just
what is going to happen. Try to
make every phiv appear the same.
In going for the line watch the
feet. Look out for jour opponents'
feet. To mnke a successful line
breaker you must get your head
down and lots of speed on, and the
only way to guide your course is by
the feet. If the place you are called
to run is filled with feet look for the
place where they are not and take it.
Homember that, it, is good football
to take any opening you can find if
the one signalled fails to materialize.
There is a certain twisting motion
that some backs develop when in a
crowd that is a most effective means
of ground gaining, especially where
the opponents are high up. Again
if the forwards fall and attempt to
stop lino runs in that way, the back,
whose eyes are looking for feet, can
guide himself over the ob*trnetinn
and always gain his length at least.
The principal things fora running
back to practice aie quick starting

the handling of hard passes on the
run, and the running both in interfer
ence and as an interferes In line
bucking he must remember that it
is fatal to slow up at the line, and
that it always pays to keep going
full tilt when tackled; on a poor tack
ier it universally gains yards, and on
a good man the impetus is good to
prevent the runners being thrown
back. It goes without Raying that
all the backs should bo good tack
lers and be able to handle punts.
Be sure to tackle low and to go
hard.
The quarter back has such an im
portant position and his duties are
so many and essential that J will
leave my remarks on the position
for another issue.
