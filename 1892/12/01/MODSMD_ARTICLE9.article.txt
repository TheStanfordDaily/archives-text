Tun arrival of Walter Camp and
McClung on the Pacific coast, marks
a new period of football in the west.
Not only will a greater interest and
enthusiasm be aroused among the
people everywhere, but the game
itsoll as played here will be greatly
improved and developed. The an
nual intercollegiate contest between
Berkeley and Stan foul will become
a permanent fixture, and before
long so much interest will bo cen
tred in the outcome of this game,
that it will be eagerly awaited by
hundreds with a zeal strongly akin
to that, manifested in the Harvard-
Yale-Princeton contests. Wo have
the material, enthusiasm, deter
mination, and above all, a climate
particularly adapted to the sport
True enough, wo lack the olÂ«] time
traditions of our eastern contem
poraries, an alumni of long standing
to aid in the coa"liing and encour
agement so necessary for success,
but we have a spirit and energy
which, as far as shawn, speaks well
for the future success of football on
the Pacific slope.
