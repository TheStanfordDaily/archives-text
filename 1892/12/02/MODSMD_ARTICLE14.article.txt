It would not be a bad idea for
i;ome enterprising stadont to liavo
r.everal hundred small cardinal silk
Hags made to Roll for tho [J. (J.-
Stanford game. Wo mention it at
this early date ro that the proper
color can be secured. We remem
ber that la√üt, year the flags arrived
only a short time before tho gamn,
and they were garnet, and not
cardinal, as ordered. If they are
(secured early (his year thoss stud
ents who wish will have an oppor
tunity to send Home of them to

their friends in tbe city before the
day of the game. We suggest that
small tlags, about, fourteen by nine
inches, and mounted on littlo red
wood sticks about twenty-two inches
long, woiihl be about the right
tiling Wo see no reason, if a
large order for such flags were ob
tained, why they could not retail at
twenty-live cents each and yield a
small profit besides.
