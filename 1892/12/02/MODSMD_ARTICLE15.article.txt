To-morrow afternoon our first
eleven will play the Olympics at
Contrail Pmk, iu San Francisco,
while, on the other side of the bay,
at Oakland, our second eleven will
play the Oakland High School team.
The threatening weather, together
with the fact that the Olympics dis
appointed us and did not material
ize at the last game announced to
bo played between them and our
team, will probably prevent many
people from attending the game.
But that it, will be a good game on
the part of our team at least, we
feel quite ture. In order !o have
proper substitutes for the first eleven,
some of which will of necessity have
to come from tho second eleven, the
latter team will be much weakened.
There is no reason, though, why
they should not, defeat, the Oakland
team. Still, it will not be a great,
surprise to us if the Oakland boys
run up quite a score against them.
When we are playing two football
teams in two cities on the same day,
it looks as though wo have plenty of
football material hero and it pre
sages well fora good strong fight
against the U. C. team.
