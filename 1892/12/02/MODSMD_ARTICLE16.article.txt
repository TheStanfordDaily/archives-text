The question now is: "Who will
be the next, captain of the I lunar !
team?" Newell, in all probability,
but Emmons and Waters have
likely chances.
The law students of the Uni
versity of Michigan are already
making arrangements to secure a
prominent speaker l\Â»r Washington's
birthday. Efforts will bo made to
secure either the Hon. .lames (J
Blaine, President Harrison, or
Chief Tustiee Fuller. Last year
( Jrover Cleveland was the orator.
For the first time in the history
of the col'oge, Amherst this year
won the football chain] ionship in
the New England League. The
coachors who have been with the
eleven during the fall are: C. O.
Gill, Yale, '8'.); 11. C. Crocker,
Amherst, '01; G. A Morse, Am
herst, '1)1; and H. A. Smith, Am
herst, '90.
By the Morill land grant nearly
one million acres <>112 land were given
by the federal government to the
state of New York for educational
purposes. The script for this land
was turned over to Cornell Univers
ity. Its value was then about fifty
cents an acre. Ezra Cornell gener
ously undertook to carry this script
and locate the land, iho scr pt for
about 200,000 acres was sold to meet
tlio expenses of locating this vast
amount of land, and to furnish
money for the immediate needs of
the new university. Over seven
hundred thousand acres, however,
were located by E/.ra Cornell in cer
tain western states, and were turned
over to the university Those lands
have netted the university $1),000,000.
To thia mm $'1,000,000 have been
added by gifts, bringing the total
endowment up to over $8,000,000.
Two million dollars have been in
vested in buildings and apparatus,
and the remaining $0,000,000 bring
the university in an annual ine me
of $500,000. Had the original script
been immediately fold, as was done
in most of the other states, it would
have netted loss than #">OO,OOO. To
Ezra Cornell, therefore, and his suc
cessors is largely duo tho present
wealth of this institution of learning.
On the other hand, the state of
New York requires Cornell Univers
ity to educate 512 sons of New York
free of all charges.
Now it is found that an income of
half a million is not, sufficient to meet
the many and varied needs of the
institution at this stage of its devel
opment, and the trustees accordingly
propose to ask the state of New
York to grant, tho university $150,000
annually, which sum would recom
pense tho university for its gratui
tous education of the 512 holders of
state scholarships.
