# Football Practice.
## 
### 
By 3:30 yesterday afternoon,
quite a crowd of students were hud
dled together in tbe cold in one
corner of the football field. By
4:30 tbe crowd was greatly swelled,
and beside tbe regular enthusiasts
who were present at every practice,
there were seen many students who
seldom appear at any game but a
scheduled one. Even a large num
ber of young ladies from lloble Hall
were present. It was apparent that
football enthusiasm was increas
ing. Throughout, the game
every good play was loudly ap
plauded.
Walter Cimp appeared on the
field for the first time an our coach.
In his quiet, unassuming manner,
he immediately put tbe men to work.
For half an hour every man in the
team practiced punting ami catching
the ball. This has been a part of
the game that has been sadly neg
lected here; but few men have even
attempted to kick the ball.
About 4:30 tbe two teams lined
up fora sharp practice game. Mr.
Camp toofr a seat at one
side of the field in a position
to make minute observations.
This is one of his methods. After
tbe game, at the training table, Mr.
(Jam)) expressed himself as being
agreeably disappointed with the
team. Each man was told of bis
own faults. Systematic coaching
will begin to-day.
But as to tbe game. The ball
was rushed by the second eleven,
well into its opponent's territory.
Then ('ode's men got the ball, and
by superior interference, principally
around the right, end, and by good
line work, a touch-down was se
cured by Harbison. Later on in
tbe game, Kennedy got the ball on
a kick, and by a long run, secured
another touchdown.
The backs of the first eleven ran
w<'ll together around the right and
around the left end. A lack of in
terference was noticeable. The ends

did not tackle or break tlie interfer
ence well. But in tlie center, es
pecially on the part of the first
eleven men, good work was done.
The hacks of tlie second eleven did
not interfere well, hut Paul Down
ing and McKay when they hucked
the line, did it with vim and almost,
invariably gained ground.
Captain Clemans appeared on the
field, but played lightly. Kennedy,
Frankenheimer, ami Hnrrelson were
obliged to retire from the field on
account, of injuries.
The men were in line as below:
