the weather is favorable.
The matter of going to Los An
geles to play during the Christmas

team, in a letter to Mr. Davey has
expressed a desire to arrange for
some games, and is willing to pay'all
the expenses of our men if they wish
to go. It was dually determined to
take the trip if satisfactory arrange
ments can be made, and dates for
games found which will not, conflict
with the football schedule.
An efl'ort will also be made to se
