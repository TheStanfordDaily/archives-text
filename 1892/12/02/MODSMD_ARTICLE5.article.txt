inasmuch an there have appeared
in these columns many of Carl M.
•lohanson's opinions on football it
may be of interest to many to know
more of him. The following is
taken from the New York World.
During the eight years that Carl
M. Johanson, tlie captain of the
Cornell football team, has played
football he has takon part in more
college games than any other player
in the country. Four years on the
Williams College field, one year as
a substitute on the Harvard, and
three years with Cornell is his rec
ord.
Capt. Johanson is an athletic
looking young man under medium
height. His face is round and full
of expression; h'S hair is dark and
bushy, ami he usually wears a slight
mustascho. He is always in training
and usually weighs 1 (»112» pounds, but
he is quick and active and any one
who plays opposite him in a game is
sure to have a busy time.
Johanson's characteristic feature
is his good nature. He never gets
excited, but always plays as if his
life depended upon the result of
the game. If victorious, he does
not celebrate, and if defeated he
works all the harder to prepare for
the next game. lie does not believe
in slugging, and if hit during the
game ho does not hit back. An exam
ple of his courage and determina
tion was shown in a hotly contested
championship game in which he
played while at Williams. During
the early part of the game Johan
son's 1)0*0 was broken by a heavy
fall. There was no one to take his
place, and as his leaving the field
would cause the loss of the game,
lie kopt his injury a secret until the
game was over and the Williams
boys were celebrating their victory.
Capt. Johanson was born in Swe
den and came to America when
quite young. He prepared for col
lege at the Omaha High School and
entered Williams College in 1885.
lie was prominent in athletics while
there and for four years played on
the football team. After graduating
lie went to Harvard and spent a
year in the law school. He was sub
stituto tackle on the Harvard team,
and would have secured a regular
placo on the team had he not been
seriously injured early in the fall.
Three years ago he went to Cornell
and, after graduating from the law
school, took a post-graduato course.
When Johanson entered Cornell,
football at that institution was only
"boys" sport. Two years ago he
rescued the team from the secret
society fraternities and since that

time his untiring energy has placed
the Cornell football team on a level
with the beat in the country. Dur
ing a game Johanson does little
talking, but by hin own work sets an
example for the team. He is a sure
tackier and u uully makes ground
with the ball.
Johanson knows what hard work
in, for outside of his football work
he has paid hist owu way through
preparatory school and college. He
owns a college athletic supply store
at Ithaca which yields him a good
income In addition he is football
correspondent fora number of lead
ing newspapers and magazines.
Besides being a good football player
Johanson is prominent in other ath
letics and tor two years has held the
heavy-weight, boxing medal of the
university.
