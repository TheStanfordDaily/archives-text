# OLYMPIC-STANFORD GAME.
## The 						Result was a Tie but is Generally Conceded to be a Stanford Victory. 
### 
It was the opinion of everyone
competent to judge that our game
at Central Park on Saturday after
noon wan the best ever played on
this coast. Everyone knows more
of the game now than they did last
year and it is to be doubted if onr
team ever lined up against a more
determined eleven than that of the
Olympic Athletic Club. The
weather looked threatening but this
did not prevent 2500 people from
coming out to witness the contest.
A large number of Stanford stud
ents attended and cheered the tain.
General Diamond, General Sheehau,
Hon J C. Campbell, and other
people of distinction, wore cardinal
colois. Clemana was nimble to play
on account of his injured knee.
It looks as if our old favorite would
not be able to captain the team on
the 17th. Waller Camp attended
and took notes on the plays. Ditto
McClung and Captain Hunt of
Berkeley. Once when the ball was
close to our goal and the signal was
given to kick, Kennedy tried to run
with the ball and the error secured a
safety lor the Olympics. Those
who distinguished themselves were
Harrelson, Frankenheimer, Wil.-on,
Code and Paul Downing. Harrel
son was the hero of the day. lie
made an entire gain of 257 yards
during the game, thus breaking the
season's record for gains of any in
dividual player in the United States.
From beginning to end our men re
lied on quickness and the Olympics
on their superior weight and
strength. It is generally conceded
that our team outplayed their op
ponents. Time was called on ac
count of darkness when the ball was
ours in the middle of the field. If
we had been allowed to play there
were any number of tricks which
could have secured our side a couple
of touch-downs, but as both sides
agreed to a referee and umpire we
must abide by their decision, what
ever apparent injustice they did us.
The line-up was as follows:
Olympics. Position. Stanfoud.
Sherrard L End W. MeLaine
Reynolds L Tackle Cochran
Wood L Guard Briggs
Crofton Center Barnhoiscl
Flagler 11 Guard Orcutt
I'orter R Tackle C S Down'g
Frick R End Wilson
Pugh Q Back Code.
Taylor LHBack Ilarrelson
Wilcox R II Back Frankh'm'r
lticketts F Back Kennedy

Edwin Fish of Wesleyan, Berke
ley's former coach, acted as referee,
and Max Rosenfeldt, ex-'95 112 was
umpire. The aim of both
seemed to be to please both sides
rather than to give just decisions.
That they failed in this aim was
evident from the frequent protest
ing.
The (Uympics won the toss and
took the ball. Stanford chose the
north goal. The Olympics open
with a wedge and gain ten yards.
From the first it was seen that they
intended to hammer our line as that
was their only chance to win. They
next sent Wilcox through the cen
ter but Bainhisel prevented any
gain. Ricketts went through light
tackle for 10. Taylor thought he
could do the same but failed.
Ricketts shows him how and makes
10 more. Dr. Wood hammers cen
ter and makes 10 yards. He ham
mers tackle for 4 more. Down
came these animated pile drivers
gaining at, every drive till the ball
was on our five-yard-line, when they
fumbled and RlcLaiue fell on the
ball. Code signaled fora kick but
Kennedy tried to run and was tack
led by Sherrard, who made a safety.

and Kennedy kicks the goal. Score,
14 8.
After the ball has changed hands
several times near the center of the
field, Shcrrard asks time be called on
account of darkness. Code refuses,
and the game is continued in a dim
light. The Olympics now play a
quick g.ime and steadily advance the
bull to the ten-yard line. Sheirard
scores a touchdown and Taylor kicks
a goal—ami Stanford objects, claim
ing the ball was not in play. It is
too dark to follow quick, compact,
plays, and the referee calls a tie on
account of darkness, declaring the
score a tie, 14-14.
Stanford wants to play out the re
maining two minutes, but the crowd
covers the field, and even the moon
is obscured by clouds, so the de
cision rests.
