# Paper Will Be Late.
## 
### 
It in probable that to-day's issue
will be twelve hours late on account
of no power to run tho press. Tho
muddy water has seriously damaged
the boilers in the power house, and
the firemen cannot got up steam.
Tho paper will bo set up as usual,
and if it cannot ho run off to-day it
will bo run oil'as soon as possible,
so that no break need bo made in the
complete files which many are
keeping.
