# Saturday Evening's Lecture.
## 
### 
It waa announced that a lecture
illustrated by stereopticon views
would be delivered iu the chapel by
President Jordan and Ur. Branuer.
Tbe latter was unable to attend,
and Dr. Jordan was compelled to do
the work of both. The principal
feature of the evening was the dis
play of stereopticon views illustrating
the lecture. These views were per
haps the finest ever shown here.
The best were those of Mt. Shasta,
the Matterhorn, Yellowstone Park,
the geysers, and the more famous
glaciers. Dr. Jordan gave descrip
tions of them, and many anecdotes
connected with them, which were in
teresting and instructive.
