It is about, time tlmt some one
should begin to give a little seriouß
reflection on the present state of our
athletic organization, or rather din
organization, for the latter term more
adequately defines the state of an
archy which exists here now. Last
year we bad an athletic assocation,
but it committed suicide before the
year was over in order to get revenue
on oue of its members. This year
there seems to be an indistinct con
nection between athletics and the
associated students, but no one un
derstands the extent of the connec
tion. The interest and enthusiasm
of individual players have provided
us with a good football team under
the control of a manager and a cap
tain, but an for any organization to
provide for the debts and profits of
the team, there is none. If the team
needs ready cash, some one starts
around with a five dollar subscription
list, and when the immediate wants
of the team are met, the list is
pocketed and that disagreeable busi
ness is ended. No account of the
expenditures and receipts is kept,
unless the football manager does so
for his own convenience and satis
faction.
Everything looks prosperous and
possibly is so, but upon that point,
not half a dozen students in the
University are certain. That con
tested points in matters of accounts
will come sooner or later is only too
evident to any one who thinks on
the subject. Students and profes
sors havo subs cribed liberally toward
the football fund, but this was be
cause they were enthusiastic and
willing to lend a helping hand any
where. In the future, money w 11
not flow'so freely. No one wants to
give when the wise expenditure of
his subscription is dependent on the
integrity and wiidotn of men who
owe their position, not to an election
by a properly qualified body but,
only to the interest they take in their
work. Manager Champlin cannot
help but feel that his position is a
delicate ono. He was elected by the
football team last, year ns one of a
committee of three to manage the
football affairs until n further pro
vision could be made for the office of
manager. Of the committee, one

position was left vacant. an<l was
never filled; the other member did
not return this year. By impliea
t on lather than by any direct under
s'nnding with the leant or student
1 ody the duties of manager devolved
on Mr. Champlin. Such a positiou
ought not to l>e satisfactory to him,
even if it is to the rest of the students.
There is a called n>e<!ing of the
Associated Students for to morrow
afternoon at 1:30 o'clock. If there be
a quorum, which, judging from the
past, is by no means assured, the
proposal of an athletic organization
will he discussed. The organization
is provided for in pioposed amend
ments to the constitution of the As
sociated Students These amend
ments have been considered before,
but were not adopted because of the
disagreement of members on minor
and technical points. At the last
meeting a deadlock occurred because
of the headstrong objections of less
than half a dozen members. These
men do not seem to consider that a
constitution, even if it does not meet
with their approval in every part cu
lar, is better than no constitution or
organization at all. The position
they assunu) is this:"I consider the
proposition you urge to be vicious.
lam infallible on these subjects,
therefore T will not, accede to it nor
ai)3 r part of it." No one is infallible
on the subject of constitution mak
ing. Why is it not better to agree
to something? Then if that some
thing is vicious, time and us»3 will
show it, and the matter can he ad
justed. As it is now affairs are in a
worse state than under the worst
constitul ion conceivable
