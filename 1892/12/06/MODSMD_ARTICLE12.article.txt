The water on the campus haw not
| been fit to use for several days. It
is isot so much water, as it, is regular
i
| heavy, yellow mud, that has been
running from the faucets in the two
largfr hulls, in the quadrangle, and
in the other buildings on the
grounds. This state of affairs is
caused no doubt by the fact that the
large main from Seatsvillo like
draws water from the bottom of the
lake. The heavy rains which it wns
hoped would free the water from its
strong, pungent, sulphurous odor
have washed down from the hillsides
about the lake great quantities of
clayey matter. Until the st rm the
main drew oil' the sulphur water that
had collected in the bottom of the
lake during the several years that
the water stood idle; now it draws
off this thin mud. Unlef-s the main
is raised to a level above the sedi
ment and mud at the bottom of the
reservoir, we maj r expect, to see the
present slate of affairs continue a*
long as the rains continue to supply
earth from the hillsides. And as
long as there is no clear water the
i engines cannot run, and there will
he neither electric lights nor steam
heat.
