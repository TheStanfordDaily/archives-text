# Football Practice.
## 
### 
The men who played in Saturday's
game were naturally somewhat
bruised when they came upon the
lield last evening, but neveitheless
a spirited game was put up by both
the Varsity and scrub elevens.
The field was never in better con
dition The severe weather of the
last week and the frost immediately
following have converted the Bandy
loam into a epringy turf. Conse
quently the practice game was de
void of accidents.
Again, as on Friday, a great deal
of enthusiasm was manifested on the
part of the students. There is noth
ing that so inspires a player to
good work as an acknowledgement
of his good play. As it is nearing
the time of our great game, we sug
gest that the college yell be given at
intervals throughout the practice
play. There is no better'time in
which to practice it, and it will also
lend enthusiasm to the game.
At 4:30 o'clock sharp, the two
teams lined up, with the ball in pos
session of the scrub team Lyons
stinted around the light end but
was quickly downed by Cochran
without gnin. After four downs the
ball went to the Varsity side. The
olTensive work of the first eleven
wns not so good as that play of last
week Mr. (3am p, who stayed
directly behind the backs of the
tirst team during the whole game,
continually admonished the backs of
their lack of unity when they hit the
line.
When the scrub eleven got the
ball on four downs, the backs
buck.d the line for continual gains.
At the thirty five yard line, near
touch, Leadbetter took the ball be
tween the right end and tackle for
a touchdown without interference.
Whitehouse kicked a goal. The

work of the Varsity forwards up to
this point. had been poor. They
continually broke through but in
variably tackled too high. Conse
quently instead of immediately
downing the running back he us
ually staggered on for small gains.
In fact, with two or three exceptions,
nearly all the men tackled too high.
When they did tackle low they us
uallv neglected to add force enough
to immediately down the runner.
Tackle low and hard, cannot be too
often repeated.
When the Varsity men got the
ball at the middle of the field a gen
eral bracing up was noticed. Coch
ran and Wilson broke through the
interference and tackled well. Har
relson soon had the ball over the
opponents' line fora touch down.
The second team got the ball and it
was forced back, and after this most
of the plajiug was done in the sec
ond team's territory. Later in the
game Code got the ball on a blocked
kick and scored another touchdowi
for the Varsity.
