The Southern Pacific Company
has had in contemplation the uiak
iug of some improvements at Palo
Alto, but these had not been made
public until very recently. It, was
known that a stone depot would bo
built. This will not be commenced
until after the lirst of January. A
new freight, depot, is to be built nt.
once, and several new switches are
laid out. After Dec. 12 all those
trains starting from Mtnlo Park au I
known as Menlo locals will start
from Palo Alto. This will be wel
comed by all students who are
obliged to travel much between here
aud San Francisco. It will be es
pecially welcomed by those who pat
ronize the theater train, and have
heretofore been obliged to walk
from Menlo Park.
