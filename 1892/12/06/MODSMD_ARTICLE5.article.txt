A few woeks ago we printed a very
flattering review of Dr. Elliott's
monograph, taken from the Review
of Review*. Keeling that it is a mat
ter of interest to eveiy friend of the
University, we take pleasure in print
ing the following extract from a sim
ilar article which appeared in the
December Industry, the leadiug sci
entilic journal on this coast, It says:
"This work is issued by theLelaud
| Stanford Junior University, Palo
' Alto, California, and covers particu-
I larly a period of forty four years,
from 17Si) to 18M3, in the economic
history of this country. We are at a
loss to know what to say in re pect
! to this work Its completeness as an
I impartial and able history, written
in a diction not common in our day,
is completely swallowed up in a
greater iact, here made plain, that
ihere has been a decadence and
a marked retrogression iu a
knowledge of economics among
public men of this country.
"The tariff, which is now discussed
as an obscure problem, and under
all kii.ds of sophistical assumptions,
was throughout this older period no
mystery. Its relations, effects, and
i nature were clear to ;i score of men
that discussed the subject at, various
times in all its bearings, differences
of opinion being confined to the ulti
mate effects on the country, and the
in justice or fairness of this method of
taxation. . . . The view of the
mbject here presented is heightened
by the method of its presentation by
Professor Elliott, who deals with the
subject impartially and, as before
said, in a style and manner not ap
proached, so far as we know, in sim
ilar writings of our day.
"To attempt a review of the woik
| exceeds the limits here at command,
aud the most we can do is to recom
| mend its careful perusal by all
thoughtful persons in s arch of truth,
and desirous of underst-indiug the
ualure aud effects of tariff taxes as
sessed on imports. . .
"We have before in a book, just
issued from the press of iMacmillan
& Co., New York, entitled, "The
Elements of Graphic Statics," by L.
M. Hoskins, professor of pure and
applied mechanics in the Leland
Stanford Junior University. It con
, tains 191 pages, with numerous plates
aud illustrations, and is bound in
I green cloth. As the work is just
J out, no review has as yet appeared.
