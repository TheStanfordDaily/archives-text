# Arrangements for the Game.

### 
It has been settled that the game
will take place at tin; Haiglit street
baseball grounds, San Francisco.
The general admission will be tlie
same for all, one dollar, for ladies as
woll as gentlemen. No charge will
be made for carriages entering '.he
grounds, as was previously reported.
Ten thousand seats have been re
served, for which there will be no
extra charge, and six hundred of
these have already been sold to the
University Club; the remainder will
be placed on sale at Sherman and
Clay's music store, on Kearney street.
It is to be hoped that none of the
students of either university will
take advantage of this sale, as it is
desired the students assemble en
masse, so as to make the college yell
ring out loud aud clear. With part
of the students on one side of the
grounds and the rest scattered
about, it will be a hard matter to
k'ivo our jell in unison, and that is
what we want to do so we can en.
courage our players.
A theater parly in ihe evening at
Stockwell's has been discussed, but
no steps have been taken as yet
towards engaging any special thea or.
