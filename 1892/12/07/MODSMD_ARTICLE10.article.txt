# Football is not Brutal.

The San Francisco C/iroiiic/c in a
recent editorial defends the great
college gnme. Alter speaking
about the vivid newspaper accounts
of recent eastern games and of the
crash and vigor of the play which
often resulted in temporary in
juries to the players, it continues:
"It was the pure love of a contest
which Americans have inherited
from t'eir Anglo-Siixon, Teutonic
and Celtic ancestors that induced
this Ponnybrook Fair sort of n
skirmish, in which the players were
as regardless of wounds and bruises
as so ninny veteran soldiers going
into battle. The desire to get the
better ef the other fellows, to es
tablish their superiority over their
opponents and to down the rival
college were the moving causes of
these contests, and who, with the
recollection of his own youth to sug
gest, to him, will not say that this
was genuine fun V
"When American boys and young
men take such interest in manly and
athletic sports of this kind it is a
good sign. It shows that tl>e
canker-worm of wealth and luxury
has not eaten into the heart of the
rising generation, and that our boys

can find some better amusement
than tlie dissipation which is en
tirely too common in this as in other
civil'zed countries. What if the
boys do get tlie wind knocked out of
them, or even a bone broken or a
joint dislocated? The injury is not
mortal, and it shows that they have
the qualities which promise success
in lifeâ€”courage, pluck and per ser
ver an ce.
"Sentimentalists may decry foot
ball as brutal, though it is not, but
we need a little infusion of such
brutality to ke.p us from degen
erating into effeminacy. We must
cultivate reversion toward the prim
itive man, who was an undoubted
brute, not because we desire brutal
ity for itself, but. because it connotes
streugth, vigor, activity, virility and
the possession of an excellence of
physique which is necessary for the
preservation of the human family,
football, however, is not brutal,
since it lacks the element of pre
determined cruelty. It is rude and
rough, and its effects are often de
cidedly painful, but that is only the
chances of the game, and those
whose nerves are too tender to wit
ness the scenes of scrimmage and
melee which are part of every foot
ball game can stay away."
