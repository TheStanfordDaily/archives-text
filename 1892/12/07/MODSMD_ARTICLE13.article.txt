Tub San Francisco dailies are to
be complimented on the way in
which they wrote up last Saturday's
Olympic Stanford game. Such at
tention to football on the part of the
largest papers of the west tends to
secure for the great college game its
due popularity on the coast. In the
east football is mooted in the papers
from the time the training season
opens, through the great games,
until the temporary strife of rival
colleges is over and the season's
heroes finally retire from the
prominence to which their splendid
playing has raised them,
The Examiner gavo two columns
with accompanying cuts to there
cent game. The Chronicle, which
from a scientific standpoint had the
best account of the game, had two
columns and cuts also. But the
Call was a surprise. Previous!)
weak in its accounts of such games
and incorrect as to the details of the
game, the colors of the contestants,
the names of the players, and even
the names of the opposing teams, it
comes out with six columns of a very
interesting, although not strictly
technical, account, accompanied b)
several very good cuts. The city
papers are becoming alive to the
importance of the game and are
booming football right along. Even
some of the larger New York dailies
are being attracted by our pros
pective game on the seventeenth,
and more particularly, since it is the
talk of the eastern players them
selves, now that we have secured
two such coaches as Camp and
McClung on this coast. They com
ment upon the fact, that both men
are familiar with Yalo's methods,
but say that there need be no fear
that either of the California teams
will be able to turn the knowledge
acquired from these men against, old
Yale, since it is very improbable
that Yale will ever meet a western
team.
All this newspaper notice does not
advertise the contest simply from a
point of tinanci d advantage to the
two teams If inter-collegiate foot
hall were only a money-making
scheme it would not be worthy so
much free advertisement. It is the
public display of the friendly rivalry

between opposing educational in
stitutions, of tlic bravery, pluck,
and daring of college men, of hardy
frames and strong physiques ac
quired by athletic exercise, of col
lege enthusiasm—all of which pro
duce the desired effect upon the
public — makes football great.
Many a young man who would never
think of acbuirng a higher educa
tion is influenced into going to col
lege by seeing one of these great
displays. While he may come to
college primarily for sport and for
athletics he is soon converted into a
diligent student. One great annual
game of intercollegiate football on
this const attended by thousands of
people does a great deal towards
forwarding higher education, al
it may be in an indirect way,
It causes college life and colleges
to be commented on, to be talked
about and to be favorably advertised.

We have learned from our exper
ience in last Saturday's game that
it is well to start the game early in
order to avoid having the playing
slopped on account of darkness.
And we have learned also that we
must have a referee and an umpire
for the groat game whose word will
he law. To begin playiug at two
o'clock sharp would not only insure
a definite result he ore dark but it
would allow time after the game
fora big street, parade before dinner
time. Many a student went to the
intercollegiate theatre party last
year without eating his nipper be
cause there was not enough time to
gat it. This year the theatre party
should be a grand affair. It is
rumored that the Grand Opera
House, the largest theatre in the
city, will be secured for the party.
