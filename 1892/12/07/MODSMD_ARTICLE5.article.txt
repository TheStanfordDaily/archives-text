Superintendent Fry was sick laM
night and unable to meet his audi
ence. When he came down from
the city, where he had been attend
ing the conven
vention, lift was siclc but it was
thought until the last moment lhal
he would be able to speak. Those
who know j\ir. Fry best say we
missed a good lecture, but we shall
hope to hear him at some future
date. Thanks to Dr. Wood's care,
ho is better this morning.
