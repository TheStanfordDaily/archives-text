### 
The recent taste it has had of foot
hall has whetted the appetite of the
public for more of the sport. It is
likely that games will bo arranged
with Tacoma, Portland, and Stan
ford I'Diversity, but none of these
would take place until the latter part
ol the month. Isi order to keep up
tho local interest a plan is being
talced of to organize a second eleven
to p'ay against that of the Seattle
Athletic Club.â€”Seattle Post-Intelli
