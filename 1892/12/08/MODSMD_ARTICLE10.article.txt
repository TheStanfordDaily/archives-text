At the beginning of the year the
Associated Students concluded to
ti v tr.e experiment of a college daily.
The Daily Palo Alto was estab
lished, and to provide for its mainte
nance a board of control was elected
and given full, powor h to start and
manage the paper for one semester.
The motion creating the committee
a1..0 provided that the board of con
trol should draft a constitution for
the permanent establishment of the
papei aud present the same for
adoption by tho Associated Stu
dents. Tho time is drawing near
when tho tfrm of office of the edi
tors, managers, and the board shall
terminate and the Associated Stu
dents are to further provide for the
maintenance of the Daily. Inas
much as future success depends
upon 11 good working constitution
those students interested ought to
begin considering methods of man
agement. The first semester closes
two weeks from to day and before
that time there will be a constitution
brought forward by the committee
in en.go for adoption by the stu
dent body.
It may not bo evident, except to
those directly interested, what a task
it is to carry on such an enterprise as
this ouo. To the average person
the newspaper is a thing to bo caught
up and read in tho space of a few
minutes, criticised*and thrown aside.
To the editors and managers it
moa' P any amount of scheming,
thinking, planning, worrying, listen
ing to complaints —from subscribers,
advorvisers, printers —and other
things too numerous to mention
All tS is must occur under a system
in which friction is roduccd to a min
imum. Under a bad system which
is the rosult of a bad constitution,
vou can add failure to the abovo list,
of what a daily newspaper means to
the editors and managers. In adopt
ing tho constitution thoso who have
had charge of the paper this year
could perhaps ofler good suggestions
h.i r rd upon their experience A few
l.'.nts here may not be out of place.
In goncral tho constitution ought
to bo very expansive in all of it.s
clauses. Whoever has control of
tho Da.ly in tho future ought not to
bo in constant, fear that they will
ovorstop tho restrictions of some
petty clause in their instructions.
Emergencies will bo coming up un
foreseen which will liavo to bo mot
ry Bomo expedients not provided for
by the student body. This is a gen

eral principle which ought to bo in
the minds of those adopting tho
constitution. More particularly
concerning this instrument, it seems
to us, that a board of control, such
as that which already has ch irge of
the pnper, would bo a good scheme
for the future. Let tho student
body elect some convenient number,
not too large, fora committee and
this committee undertake a general
supervision of the paper. Have it,
provided that this board elect an J
editor-in-chief who shall appoint as
many assistants as he sees lit, and a
manager who may also appoint as
sistants. If the attempt is made to
have the editor and manager elected
by the student body ami the at
tempt succeeds, tho outlook for the
Daily Palo Alto is not blight.
A large number of students, in
electing some of their number to
positions requiring ability, are too
apt to be influenced by other con
siderations than the fitness of tho
candidates. Not that a board ot
control is not moved by similar
motives, but the probability is less
ened as the choosing body grows
smaller. Then, too, there is to be
taken into consideration the fact
that the choice may be an unwise
one, in which casu it is only too
evident, that the inefficient, editor
or manager elected by the
students would remain in
ofiice, where as he could
easily bo removed by a bo nd of
control. These considerations, it,
seems, would warrant this method
of management. There are others
which may be urged when the con
stitution committee has made more
progress.
