# No Lecture Friday Evening.
## 
### 
The lecture announced to be given
by Mr. Camp in the chapel Friday
evening will have to be postponed
indefinitely 011 account of an engage
ment, in Siin Francisco which
Mr. Camp must meet that evening.
The lecture which was to be given
t'at evening may possibly not be
given sit all. I\lr. Camp's time is so
much occupied wiih the team and
liis eastern correspondence tliat it
will be difficult if not impossible to
ijjive a lecture before returning to
New Haven.
