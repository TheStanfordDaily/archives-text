Section 1 of IV. of the j
Snjtioia, constitution says : "On or
before the third Tuesday of Novem
ber of each year, the faculty, the
post-graduate students, the speoial
students, and each of the four col
lego classes, shnll meet in separate
caucus and eject, by ballot, one of
its number to bo its representative l ,
director. The seven so chosen shall
constitute the lioard of directors."
We do not think that a single one
of the classes has attended to this
matter. It is but another illustra
tion of the hap-hazard way in which
our students'affairs are conducted
It is a good thing for one to get
rid of the idea that he is the
cynosure of the public eye. A part
of the editorial duty is to comment
on what are believed to bo errone
ous movemeinents or tendencies
Put it is amusing to note the eager
ness with which certain people
pounce upon any such criticism and |
apply it to themselves. This be
trnys a consciousness of fault grati
fying to the editor, for it assures
him of the justice of his remarks.

such persons apllv. He says, if you ,
throw a stone into a pack of dogs
you can tell which one it strikes by j
the way he yelps. "If ho aint, hit,''
says the evangelist, " what does he

Although the present athletic
board will only hold oHice until the
third Tuesday in January, there are
many things which they enn inves
tigate and take action upon. The
condition of the running track is a
Ruhject demanding immediate at
tention. Some pains should he
taken to discover just what is the
matter with it at present, and what
improvements will give us a track
that is second to none in the coun
try. The money accruing on the
17lh inst. ought to he more than
sufficient, for this. Again there is a
crying need for an athletic club
house, where the entire team—
football, athletic, or baseball, as the
oase may he—can live, and be quick
ly put ill condition. While we can
not expect to get one this year,
judicious agitation will mako it

i easier of aHuimncnt next. Wo aic

direction. Never, heretofore, since
the opening of the University, do
we remember of a properly audited
statement of athletic expenses being
submitted to the student body for
approval- Surely such laxness does
not argue a very hoaltliy interest on
tlio part of the students in this most
1 imporlant branch of their affairs,
i After a whole semester of legislative
spasms the s'udent body has Jit
length made constitutional provision
for athletics. The Board, as" pro
vided for, is somewhat in the nature
of an experiment. It is expected that
its influence will he vigorous and
powerful. Let its members see
that these expectations are fulfilled.
