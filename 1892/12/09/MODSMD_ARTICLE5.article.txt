Dr. T. C. Chamherlin, former
President of the University of Wis
cousin, and now professor of geol
ogy at the University of Chicago,
paid us a visit on the 31, 4th, and
Jst,h. Dr. Chnmberlin found hero
many of the members of the faculty
brought together by him at the
University of Wisconsin. Pro
fessors Marx, A. W. Smith, Wing,
and Iloskins wore formerly at Mad
ison, and all of them speak of Dr.
Chamherlin in the highest terms as
an executive officer, a successful
university president, and as a genial,
kind hear tr d gentleman.
Several of these old acquaintances
met Dr. Chamherlin a' Professor
Branner's Sunday evening. On
Monday lie went to see some of the
geology of the Coast Range near
San Jose, and the next day left for

Calaveras county, where he will study
tlie geology of that portion of the
Sierras for the purpose of determin
ing the geological ngo and position
of the beds in which the famous
Calaveras skull was found.
Professor Chamberlin is the lead
ing authority in the United States
and in the world ou glacial geology,
and his visit to the coast was made
at the instance of Professor Branner
for the purpose of ascertaining so
far as it could be done in so short a
time the relations of the Sierras and
the Sierra gravels to the glaciation of
the eastern portion of North
America.
