# Co-Education at the University of Edinburgh.â€”Incidents of the Opening Day.
## 
### 
In speaking ol' tlie fall opening of
the University of LMiuburgh, when
women were admitted for the lirst
time oil precisely the same terms as
men, the London Times says :
" Some of the women were rather
embarrased by the amount of atten
tion they received, especially by the
cheers which greeted their entrance
into the class room. In the natural
philosophy class-room, a jocular
student started the chorus of
' Clemantino,' whereupon the refrain
of'Oh, My Darling'was bellowed
with infinite zest from a hundred
throats. In the logic class, a blush
ing maiden, accompanied by her
brother, sat upon tho same bench
with him, but the servitor pounced
upon her and conducted her to the
reserved front benches amid the
cheers of the men In Professor
Masson's class the suggestive move
ment of one of the women who
bent down to ask information from
a student near tier, was immediately
greeted with cries of ' Do it again! "'
Perhaps nothing could illustrate
better to us the extreme conserva
tism of our British cousins thau in
cidents such as the above.
