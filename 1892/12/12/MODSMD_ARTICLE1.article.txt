# An Evening With James Whitcomb Riley.
## 
### 
The members of the Faculty,
their wives, and the young ladies of
Roble gathered in Roble parlor to
meet the Hoosier Poet Saturday
evening, and the time passed with
him was ono which will long bo re
membered by those who wore pres
ent. Mr. Riley was introduced to
the company by Dr. Jordan and he
acknowledged the introduction in
such a charming and pleasant, man
ner that he immediately won the
hearts of all. He said that he had
beon invited by his old friend Dr.
Jordan, to talk to those present;
that he had not prepared any speech;
further, that he was nothing but a
plain Hoosier; and that probably
the best speech he could give would
be to recite some of his own pro
ductions written in Hoosier dialect.
He then recited a piece which de
scribed a quarrel between two stub
born old Indiana farmers; then an
extremely comical story of an old
fellow who imagined that he had
the faculty for good story-telling.
Next came the story of a conceited
young city fellow who went down to
a country school and attempted to
give the pupils an object lesson.
At the request of one of tho la
dies present, Mr. Riley next recited
a sweet little poem entitled "That
Old Sweetheart of Mine." Follow
ing this were several of his sketches
from child life, viz, "Little Orphan
Danny" and "An' the Gobelins 'll
Get Yer ef Yer Don't Watch Out,"
Mr. Riley testified to his deep love
for children, his accounts of which
many of us have probably read. He
has a very expressive face and to
watch his varying expressions dur
ing his readings was a pleasure.
The evening's entertainment was
varied by sweet vocal selections from
Mrs. Smith and Prof. Campbell.
