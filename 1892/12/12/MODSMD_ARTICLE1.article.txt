The members of the Faculty,
their wives, and the young ladies of

him was ono which will long bo re
membered by those who wore pres
ent. Mr. Riloy was introduced to
tho company by Dr. Jordan and he
acknowledged tho introduction in
such a charming and pleasant, man
ner that ho immediately won the
hearts of all. He said that he had
beon invited by his old friend Dr.
Jordan, to talk to those present;
that ho had not prepared any speech;
further, that, ho was nothing but a
plniu Hoosier; and that probably
the best speech ho could give would
be to recite some of his own pro
ductions written in Hoosier dialect.
He then recited a piece which de
scribed a quarrel between two stub
born old Indiana farmers; then an
extremely comical story of an old
fellow who immagined that ho had
the faculty for good story-telling.

young city fellow who went down to
a country school and attempted to
give the pupils an object lesson.
At the request of one of tho la

Get Yer of Ycr Don't Watch Out,"
