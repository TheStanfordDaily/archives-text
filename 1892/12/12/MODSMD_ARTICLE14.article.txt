The Hags have come and are at
the Co-op. There are several dif
ferent shapes euitably furnished with
small lying ribbons so that they can
be fastened to canes, umbrellas,
flag-sticks, fishing poles, or to what
ever other contrivance the owner
may see lit to attach them. But the
color is net correct. The small rib
bons are not tho same shade as the
Hags, but they are nearer the correct
slmde. In spite of tho warning of
the Daily Pa no A r/ro not, to get gar
net colored Hogs instead of cardinal,
we see last year's mistake repeated
and Stanford students almost forced
to purchase Hags that are not the
Stanford color, but several shades
too dark.
It is very important that tho Hags
displayed by t! e students themselves
should be cardinal, and not some
thing that is "pretty near the color."
Cardinal, wo be'iove, is tho most
beautiful shade of red. The general
public and tho student body as a
whole judge of our color by our
Hags. Tho flags, by :il 1 means,
should be lh< JSl.tw/urtf color. Lot
these flags bo changed immediately
for the proper shade." Wee an betttr
afford to wait a day or two longer
for them th.au we can to go to San
Francisco and wave such a produc
tion of the whimsical idea of the
persons who had the matter of ling.-"
in charge. We appeal to the stud
ent body as a whole, and to tho new
students particularly who have not
yet had an opj ortunity to sport car
dinal, not to wave these off-shade
flags at the game. It is not a matter
of, as some may say, â€¢ 'Oh, wo may
as well buy them now that they are
here " Jf the football management
has them in charge, it, is better for it
to lose a hundred dollars 011 tho
stock and sell the flags for patch
work than to have the Stanford stud
ents go out boforo Saturday's thous
nnds hearing such a r.lmdo. If the
Hags are not to be exchanged, let
thcin remain in stock, and let every
loyal Stanford student wear cardinal
ribbons instead. Twenty-live cenls'
worth will furnish each one with
quite a display.
Wo refer to Webster's Interna
tional Dictionary for cardinal. The
word itself is derived from the Latin

canto, the hinge of ;i door, that on
which a thing turns or depends,and
means, of fundamental importance;
pre-eminent; supeiioi; chief; prin
cipal. Cardinal lvd is defined as "a |
bright red, darker than crimson, and i
betwocn sn.irlet and ctimson." We |
recognize the fact that there rrc sev- i
eral shades of cardinal, and that the '
darkest shade is not satisfactory to 1
the average Stanford student. When j
we say blue we not particularize J
that deep shade of blue, that ex-!
treme which verges into and isj
hardly distinguishable from black. I
The students chose cardinal to rep-'
resent Stanford aB "pre-eminent, su-'
perior," and the (students as a whole,
not one or two, should pay what
shade it is. Their choice on all oc
casions since the color was adopted,
with tho exception of last 3 ear's
sorry mistake by the maker of the
ilags who has repeated tho mistake
this year, has een for tl.e ''bright
red, between scarlet and crimson,"
hut a little nearer scarlet than
crimson.
Too much cannot be said to im
press upon Stanford supporters the
effect of a 'great, b'azing mass of
bright, unvaiying cardinal in Hags,
banners, ribbons, and whatever
way the co'or can bo displayed at
the game. One color alone must be
strong in order to show up well
against such a beautiful combination
as U. C.'s blue and gold. Cardinal
is a strong, s'riking, beautiful color.
