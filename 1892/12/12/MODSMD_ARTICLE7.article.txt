### 
A much larger audience than usual
attended llie Y. M. C. A. meeting to
hoar the address of Mr. McClung, of
Yale, '1)2, which was announced as
the leading feature of the evening.
Dr. Wood led the meeting and chose
tlie text, c Jso jo therefore perfect."
I fits remarks were intended to show
how to load a more intense Christian
life by a fuller development of all
sides of man's nature, physical as
well as mental and moral. lie
pointed to the example of Mr. Mc-
Clung as an example of such a har
monious development. Several of
the active members of the association
volunteered testimony on the same
line of thought.
Mr. McClung, the speaker of the
evening, was then presented by I>r.
Wood. The speaker explained that
he had not been able to prepare any
formal address, but had a few
thoughts to offer on Y. M. C. A.
work. lie spoke of the work at
Yale as being perhaps the most suc
cessful of any college Y. M. C. A.
work in the country. Of the two
thousand students, about one thous
and were members of the associa
tion. Their meetings consisted of
Sunday evening meetings, in which
some prominent speaker was invited
to deliver Â«n address, and the class
prayer meetings held every day in
the various rooms of Pwight Hall.
These latter meeting* were informal
affairs carried on by the members.
A great and active interest is taken
in them.
The speaker referred to the usual
theoretical t aiks given to young men,
which rather deaden than enliven
the interest of the young listeners.
The more effective talks are the more
practical ones. He wished to im
press upon his hearers the thought
of working toward ultimate ends
rather than immediate results.. The
speaker closed with Lord Nelson's
dying words: ''1 have done my duly,
and 1 thank the Lord for it."
Mr. McClung is not a ready nor
II lient speaker, but he indicated that
iie is an active Christian worker.
After the address the topic changed
to a more material subject, that of
great advantages of having a Y. M.
C. A building. Mr. Johnson gave
a carefully analyzed compilation of
statistics concerning these buildings
in other colleges, the great good
they do in various ways, and their
cost. Mr. McClung was asked con
cerning the practical good done the
association at Yale by 1) wight's IT all.
He replied in general terms, showing
the benefits. Mrs. Stanford was at
the meeting.
