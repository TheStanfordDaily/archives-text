### 
The Stanford baseball leam went
lo San Mateo Saturday afternoon
and played a gamo with the team at
Brewer's school. Messrs. Brewer
and Porter wero particularly liind in
their attentions to the boys during
their short stay.
The game was only seven innings
long on account of limited time.
The San Mateo boys played very
well for their cUss, and surprised
our team by the good showing they
made. The principal features of the
game were the line pitching of
Campbell, who did not allow a sin
gle hit oil his delivery and struck
out twelve men; tho great one
handed catch of a wild throw by
third baseman Bay; the good work
of San Mateo's short-stop, Edwards;
and the heavy batting ot Lewis and
Davey. Manager drove acted as
