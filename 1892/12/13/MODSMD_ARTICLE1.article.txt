# WALTER CAMP'S FOOOBALL TALK.
## Some Reminiscences of the Field Told by "The Father of American Football." 
### 
The postponed lecture of Walter
Gump was given in tlio chapel yester
day afternoon. It wasn't a lecture
though, but an alter dinner speech,
minus the dinner. It was pointed,
pleasing, bright, illustrated by hum
orous and witty anecdotes —just s .icli
a talk as one hears given in response
to a toast. Dr Jordan in present
ing Mr. Gamp said that lie could
not hope to introduce a man better
known than himself.
110 spoke in sub.tance as follows:
"The origin of the game is ancient.
Originally it was played parish
against parish, with any number of
men and on a field miles in extent.
From a game witnessed by a few
score of peoplo it has become one of
the most popular of athletic games
The reason of its popularity may be
found in the fact that it encourages (
pluck, endurance, and grit in the
players and these arc qualities which
people admire. We may not be iike
the man who,
If two dog* beneath his window fight,
Ile'll close his Bible to enjoy the sight,
but we all admirecontosts which call
into play these qualities.
"The game as we play it to-day is
derived from the old ltugby-lJnion
game. Eirlyintho seventies Har
vard wont up <o Ganada to play
Magill University, and brought back
admiration for the game from there.
In 75 Harvard and Yale played a
game in imitation of this Rugby-
Union game. Hut such a game!
One side know nothing of running
with the ball, and the other knew
littlo ol kicking it. The «amo ended
in a quarrel. Deforo their meeting
the following year they adopted
the llugby- Union rules with
a few changes, and thus settled fool
ball in this country on a sound basis.
Previous to this time the interelass
contests were not much better than
football rushes It will characterize
the gamo if J toll you of the
t rms of acceptance of a certain
football challenge given by '75 to
'7<>. It was the custom for the
freshmen to challenge the sopho
mores, and '7(5 challenged To indue
form. The answer to the challenge
was,' Gome, and as smoking sacri
fices before the wild eyed god of war
wo will oiler you.' "
Mr. Gamp went on to explain tho
condition of collego aflaiis at Yale
before the introduction of athletics,
lie explained that the surplus en

orgy of the students was utilized in
barbarous encounters with tlio lire
men of New Haven. Ho related the
famous story of tho killing of Pat
O'Neill by the "d.gs of High street"
as illustrating his point Professor
llichmlson, a mathematician of Yale,
has made a chart showing the do
orcase of this barbarism since the in
traduction of athletics. Concerning
the history of tho game Mr. Cam])
gave a few items.
"Tho Rugby-Union rules as used
in England could not be adopted in
this country. The games wero gov
erned more by tradition than by the
written law. Here is ono of 1 lit is
written rules: A touchdown ia made
when tho ball is dead behind the
goal. Dead was defined as, when
the ball was motionless or fa'rly ho.
This clause, or fairb/ so, was so
sweeping that it could admit of any
interpretation by our players who
had not the traditions of the English
game to guide them.
"Umpiring w,is first left to the
captains, later to a referee and two
advocates, one for each team, then to
an umpire, and final y to an umpire
and a referee. Then scoring went
through a variety of changes. Touch
downs and safeties did not, count at
first, but only goals. Then a num
bcr of touch downs counted fora
goal, and finally our present system
was adopted. Resides these we had
to comhat the influence of the news
papers which invariably sent prize
fight reporters to write up the games.
"Next came tho difficulty of tho
block game. By the rules a team
never loHt the ball on down. The
ball could be passed back and then
brought forward to tho center and
downed any number o!' times without
loss to that sido. Tho five yard rule
was adopted, and tho field marked
off with linos. No rule had been
adopted beforo which openol up the
gamo like this ono.
"The next great development was
I ti e introduction of interference,
i This lo an Englishman is tho great
est heresy. Wo tried to keep to
their way of playing, but «tho game
was stupid to the audience, and des
pite tho opposition, interference was
adopted. The rule has provided for
tho prettiest plays that have ever
i been seen on tho field. It gives
| greater scope to team work, and bids
: fair fo bo tho greatest developer tho
gamo has yet seen."
Mr. Camp then gavo many thrill
ing reminiscences of the field, tolling
j how McClung's team played their
; great game against Harvard ami
Princeton hi>t. 110 spoke briefly of
1 the arguments of brutality of tho
game, loading to the conclusion that

tho accidents of the gamo do not
overtop its importance.
110 then spoke briefly of the ethics
of tho game, showing his high ideal
of football honor. No one of tho
audieneo listened to ibis part of the
talk without feeling keenly that the
gamo is ono which tests most se
verely the gentlemanly qualities <>112
tho players. Mr. Camp received
great applause at the end of his dis
course.
