# Decorative Art in the Home
## 
### 
Mr. Russell's lecture last night
was the best he has yet given. His
subject was, "Decorative Art in the
Home," mid his talk was full of in
teresting and valuable information.
The most important principle in
the decoration of homo is that of
personal relation. Every I hing about
one should be in some way related
to himself, and things so related to
the same thing come to have a rela
tion to each other, and there will be
the highest harmony in ilio decora
tion. An artist's studio, where
everything means something to tho
artist, is a good illustration. Joaquin
Miller has papered tho walls of his
cabin willi le tters and clippings of
all sorts, because each thing has
pleased him or meant something to
him, and the result is what Mr.
Russell calls tho most remarkable
wall paper he l:as ever soon.
When wealthy people have money
to spend upon interior decorations
they seldom follow what is in har
mony with their own natures, but.
they make copies of foreign palaces
and such like, inv.uiably copying
everything that is bad in them.
A house should bo furnished for
tho ordinary, not for the extraordi
nary. If white and gold sofas are to
bo the most necessary articles, have
them in your house, but if there is
to be no use for them, they are out
of place. Too much study and ap
preciation are given to individual
things. There is a higher degree of
art in studying tho relations of indi
viduals to one another. The white
and gold sofa may bo a beautiful
thing in itself, but it must be in a
white and g dd sofa room. William
Morris snys: "Have nothing in your
house that you do not know to bo
useful and believe to bo beautiful."
Many persons put things in their
houses thai they know to bo out of
place, but bocauso these somethings
have cost money, they let them stay
and retard the development of tho
artistic sense. If people were bravo
enough to smash things that ihey
recognize as crrois, they would mako
greater nrt, progress than they do.
Culture in literacy ta:-le is so gen

oral that literary discords are not
tolerated for an instant; but tlie sen
sitiveness to discoid in art lias not
yet been developed to such an ex
tent tlmt. people are willing to dis
card what they foci to be out, of har
mony with other things. No one
makes a gift of pernicious literature;
very many people give their friends
articles which arc pernicious in art,
and these lattir, for the sake of the
giver, must he treasured in spite of
thiir discord Then again, too
many people la'k Ihe courage of
their convictions; they are easily
bulldozed by shopkeepers into buy
ing undesirablo things.
In the decorations of rooms, par
allelisms are to be observed, opposi
tions avoided. All contrast is arro
gant and assfr!ive; there should be
no "spots" in a room which empha
size the individual objects of decora
tion Pictiuvs with glariug white
mats against a dark wall, great,
bright frames, with stiff, unbending
curtains, all tbeso offend the eye and
break the harmony of tho whole
room. Tho study of background is
important; thoso co'ors which re
semble tlesh more or less closely
make the most livable background.
Mr. Russell closed his lecture with
tho description of a room ho once
changed fiom an ugly, cheerless
placo to an artistic, harmonious
room, and the cost of tho transfor
mation was three cents short ol ten
dollars. He did not say what was
done with the extra three cents.
The last lecture of tho court-e will
bo given next Monday evening,
when Mr. Kussell will read from
William Morris, and also answer any
questions that may be passed Jin to
him o.i slips of paper before the
lecture.
