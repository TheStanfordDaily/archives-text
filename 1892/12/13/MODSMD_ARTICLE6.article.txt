The football lecture of yesterday
left a profound impression on all
who heard it, if such an impression
can be inferred from the remarks
made. None can help admiring Mr.
Camp for that faithful adhesion to
the highest moral and ethical prin
ciples which characterize his every
thought in the game. With such
ideas of gontletnanlines9, football
becomes a game which instills into
players and audiences those higher
qualitios which means success in
overy station of life. Wanting in
such ideas, football becomes what
many consider it, a brutal unmanly
contest. Listening to Mr. Camp
the thought impresses itself upon us
more and that football is just
what wo make it. Our game of last
year lacked many of those defects
which mar more skilful games. Un
der the tuition of the two famous
coaches of this year it, ought to be
settled upon a foundation which will
insure its future succcss on this
coast.
Concerning the celebration of vic
tory the lecture of yesterday sug
gested some good ideas From news
papers wo are to believe that vic
tories in somo of the great eastern
games aro celebratod in a way that
would suggest anything but acts o(
college bred men. We have reason
to fool justly proud of our celebra
tion and theatre party ot last year.
Wo may not win this year but if wo
do wo have reason to expect a repe
tition of last years celebration.
