It would not be a very difficult
task to clear tho asphaltum tennis
courts near tlto men's gymnasium
from the thin covering of dirt and
gravel that the recent heavy rains
have washed upon them. If the
regular workmen about the campus
do not lake tho matler in hand we
suggest that some of the tenuis en
thusiasts borrow two or three hoes
and dovoto twenty minutes to scrnf
ing tho debris off. If the tennis
players wait for someone to put the
courts in order and do not evince a
desiro to help themselves they are
liable to bo in the same boat with
the track athletes.
