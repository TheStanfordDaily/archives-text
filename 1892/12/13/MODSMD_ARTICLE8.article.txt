The Cornell Sun says tbat com
plaints have been made that tho pa-|
por devoted too much space toad- 1
vertisments and not enough spaco to
reading matter, therefore a Sun ic
porter determined to ascertain how
tho paper compared with other col
lege dailies in this respect. Tho Sun
then continues:
"The following shows the amount
of reading matter in the leading col
lfgo dailios; it is not claimed that
tho measurements are in all capes
absolutely accurate, but it, is claimed
that this list is a fair average of the
spaco occupied b} r pure reading mat
ter; LI. of M. Daily, 82 inches; Daily
Palo Alto, 7S inches; Yalv News,
7inches; Harvard Crimson, 715
inches; llrown Herald, 73 inches;
I'rfnrrtonian, 72 inches. Tho Sun is
under contract with tho printers to
furnish <Si inches of reading matter."
There aro two of tho nine college
dailies which the Sun has entirely
overlooked, tho Canlinn! and the
Ncwa. Tho Cardinal is printed in
type a sizo smaller than of the Sun
and averagos at least, 90 inches of
matter. Tho News is printed in the
same sizo type as tho Cardinal and
averages 100 inches of reading
ma't r. â€” IJ. of Chicago Pa i '// A r <:wtt.
Tho above figures may interest the
readers of tho Daily Palo Alto.
Tlie editor who made the above
measurements has evidently taken
somo of tho earlier issues of this pa
per as tho later issues will average
much higher than this. Wo select,
three of the later issues at random.
The Daily Palo Alto of Nov. 30th
contained 111 inches of reading
matter, that of Dec. Gth, 105 inches,
that of Dec. 7th, 1)7 inches, an aver
age of 104 inches.
