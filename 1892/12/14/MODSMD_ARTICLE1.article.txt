# MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT
## Last of the Tuesday Evening Lectures for this Semester. 
### 
Some one remarked in coming out
of the chapol after the lecture last
night that the Lest lectures given
here were by our own professors. ll'
one will consider this remark he will
find it true. It was especially true
of Prof. Go. 10 Howard's given
last night on municipal government.
This subject given as a popular lec
ture is not one which will attract
a large audience was shown when
President White spoke on the same
subject last spring. The audience
which assembled last night was a
good one and the applause which
they gave the speaker testified their
appreciation of his effort. Prof.
Howard is not a trained elocutionist,
and is disposed to slight many of
the artifices practiced by] I hat class
of speakers, but lie speaks clearly,
and has that great merit of earnest
ness wdiicli not only holds the audi
ance but is imparted to his hearers.
He is energetic aud makes others so.
It would not bo possible to give a
full out'ine of the lecture in the
spa?e allotted here, but a few of the
more important points discussed can
be~mentioned. He introduced the
topic of municipal government with
the ([notation from Captain John
Smith, "What so suits as the peopl
ing of countries and the building
of cities," and proceeded to state
some of the problems of cities.
That of governing and cleaning are
the greatest and we as Americans
have made the greatest failures in
these. We have just reason to feel
proud ol laving planted the conti
nent, made the federal government,
and settled the constitution. In
doing these wo have passed through
two critical periods and are now con
fronted by a third, the establish
ment of an ellicient administration.
While rejoicing in the successful so
lutions of these two problems wo
have drifted into the not less diffi
cult ones of the spoils system and
careless government. Wc have the
reputation of being a quarter of a
century behind the old world but
the hour of reform has struck.
The speaker then proceeded to an
analysis of the municipal problems,
dwelling on the centralization of
population, its causes and results,
lie showed from well selected sta
tistics the amount of tho shifting of
population from the country to the
city. These figures were compared
with similar ones from tlieO d \\ orld
showing that though our cities are
no faster in growth they are vastly
worse in condition. In detail he

took up the defects of city adminis
tration, the sanitary engineering,
lighting, police, police courts, street
railways, and politics, and not only
did he show these defects but he
suggested remedies.
Tho fundamental causes of these
defects may be found in one miscon
ception of the true character of tho
municipality. Wo still cling to the
old idea of the township, that the
municipality is a political organiza
tion —the state reduced in siz° —and
must bo regulated like tho state.
The European idea is that the mu
nicipality is a business corporation,
and it is accordingly run on business
principles. European cities are run
by business men; ours by the cen
tral committee man and the ward
and precinct boss.
Prof. Howard then reviewed the
attempts to manage the city, and
still maintain tho old idea, and gave
the various recent solutions of the
problem as suggested by thinkers
and writers of distinction. The mu
nicipal franchise of women was
strongly argued for, as was also the
municipal ownership of street rail
roads, electiic and gas plants, and
all other natural monopolies.
In conclusion Prof. Howard noted
that the most perfect charters could
not avail anything without a political
regeneration. It is not enough to
do away with tho machine, but its
trappings, the gerrymanders, floaters
in blocks of live, ballot box stuffing,
etc. —aU these ought to go to the
museum with the thumbscrews, rack,
wheel, and other instruments of tor
ture as relics of the dark ages, Hut
regeneration must begin in ourselves.
In this the university is tho strong
counter] art to public vice and cor
ruption. In training young men and
women in science and philosophy it
is making thorn safeguards ngainst
corruption. The mind trained to
look for truth in fields of science will
not descend to publics immorality.
This is the rule even if there are ex
ceptions. In men so trained must
we look for the statesmen of the
future.
