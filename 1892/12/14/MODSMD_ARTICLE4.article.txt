# PROPOSED FOOTBALL LEGISLATION.
## Important Changes Proposed in the Intercollegiate League, 
### 
An important change which will 1
probably bo made when the college
advisory committees meet will be in
the direction of making the game of
i football more open. As one well
known player said a day or two ago,
I football bus arrived at the position
in which the navies of tho world
have been placed as far as armor and
projectiles are concerned; an<l brute
j strength, which seems to rule, will
have to give way to speed or ma
noeuvering of some sori. When the
j Yale committee meets, the question
jot' legislation upon the "wedge"
system of play will come up, and it
is probable that the rules under
i which it is used will be &o modified
that it can only bo brought, into play
occasionally, and with little effect as
j compared with its present use. It
has come to be a recognized fact
that whenever the "wedge" is
used, there is always somebody on
the ground in front of it to be used
as a butler to prevent its further
progress, and that tho accidents
which happen on tho football field
are largely due to this play.
Members of this Committee any
that with the limiting of this par
ticular play will come a much more
open game, and that is what the
spectators prefer. The great inter
est which was taken in the "flying
wedge" which was used this year in
the game between Harvard and Yale,
and was greatly applauded, has con
vinced some of the members of the
committees that tho more open a
game is tho better it is appreciated.
It is now the opinion of the leading
members of tho committees which
look after the football interests of
large colleges that r» more opju
game will have to come, and that
not only will it be more plea ant to
look at, but the chances of injury
! will be much lessened, or rather they
will be reduced to a minimum. The
{ spectacle of a lot of men making bat
! tering-rams of themselves while an
other lot try to turn tliemselvos into
a stone wnll to be haltered, is not,
likely to bo continued in tho coming
seasons, and a wiser move could not
be made.
The question of eligibility to com
pete on college teams has raised a
good deal of discussion, and while
some of tho men think that the rules
now in voguo are good enough, there
are others who are of the opposite
opinion—the latter are in tho major
ity. Those men not only declare
that a radical change is necessary,
but that it is sure to come. Speak

ing of the probable action to be
taken by the Yale Advisory Com
mittee on this point, a prominent
man in college athletics said:
"The chief point to be considered
is the length of lime which a man
can play for his college, and some
are of the opinion that it should be
set as low as three years. This is,
however, only held by a few, and the
four year limit is moro apt to pre
vail. The law will bo made so strict
that it cannot be broken either in
letter or spirit, and much good is
sure to come of it. Yale will take
this f-tand and it is possible that
thoso colleges which do not see tit
to concur with it will be left to man
age their own affairs and see how
they will contrast with a college
which is anxious to do all it can to
help along true amateur sport. It
is a wise step to take, and no one
can justly find fault with any col
'ege for standing upon such high
ground.
"Throwing a&ide (he fact that the
proposed course is by far the most
honest one, it would seem to be the
ono intended to bring about such
changes in the sport as will do away
with much of ti c complaint which
has been made of late against the
whole system of athletics. It ia
thought that the number of meu
who will take part in the college
sports will be largely increased by a
ruling of this kind, and that every
body will bo benefited by the change,
it. is well known that the college
teams are mada up of as many old
men as can be induced to go back to
college and that in consequence the
new comers are discouraged at the
very outset of their college life,
when they hear that such and such
old players will bo coaxed back to
take part in the games in which they
had been successful in former years.
