A very interesting talk was given
to the class in l'.Uli Century History
this morning by Captain Harkins,
late of the U. R. A. The captain
told of his experience in and about
Paris at the time of the Franco-
Prussion War. Ho was the bearer
of important United States govern
ment despatches, and in that posi
tion was enabled to observe the mili
tary manoeuvres in all their details.
Captain Harkins served creditably
though the Civil War, and since his
visit to France has engaged iu
various Indian wars. He will probÂ«
ably lecture next semester to the
class in Pacific Slope History, on the
N(z Perces Indian War which took
place on the borders of California,
Oregon, and Idaho.
