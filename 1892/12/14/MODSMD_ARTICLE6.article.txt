We must congratulate ourselves
upon at last having a University
eong that is really our own— words,
music, and all. Prof. A. W. Smith
has written it, find Mrs. Smith has
composed the music to which it is to
bo sung. 13ut perhaps the greatest
cause for self congratulation lies in
the fact that in every line and senti
ment the poem touches upon that
which is peculiar to Stanford Uni
versity, and to no other. It puis
into words the poetry which is in
the glorious mountains and blue
skies of California, in the lon»;
stately colonnades and waving palms
of our quadrangle. I(s words will
recall tho familiar sccne to the
mind, long years after its beauties
have faded from the sight and the
alma mater has received our linal
adieus. We take pleasure in extend
ing to Prof, and Mrs. Smith the
thanks of the students for their kind
endeavors,

The atldctic board in providing for
an athletic treasurer has enacted a
by-law which says that the treasurer
must furnish bonds to the amount of
$5,000 We can gather from this
something of the magnitude of the
taslca which will devolve upon this
oflicer. Would it be anything more
than just in su.di a case that the
treasurer be allowed a certain small
per cent of all the moneys which pass
through his hands in return for the
trouble and responsibility which
that money entails? The manage
ment. of every department of our
students' affairs is, of course, to a
very largo extent, simply a matter of
honor with Iho individual; yet in the
handling of money with all the res
ponsibility that must attend it—es
pecially where large bonds must be
furnished —it seems no more than
right that some remuneration should
be given.

A Fruit Yale and Harvard liavc
played their annual football gamo, it
is Hie custom for tho freshmen of
tho two universities to moot upon
tho battlefield. AYou'd this not bo an
excellent custom to introduce into our
relations with the U. (J V Freshmen,
from tho very nature of things, must
lack class and college spirit until
some powerful motive has drawn
them together and given them pride

in their class and in their college.
Hence the redeeming fat urea of the
old time class rushes which developed
class spirit, and hence, 100, the
greater advantages of intercollegiate
class games which develop both
class and college spirit. Let the '9G
manager arrange a game for some
time early in next semester.
