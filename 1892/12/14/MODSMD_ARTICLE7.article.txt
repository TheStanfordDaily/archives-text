# Yale-Harvard Debate
## 
### 
The enthusiasm and favor with
which the debate between Yale and
Harvard was received last year, has
led to the hope that these intercol
legiate cont.cs's may become perma
nently established. A committee
from tho two colleges met recently
at Springfield and made araange
ments fora second annual debate.
The contest will bo held at Cam
bridge oa January 13th, each
side being represented by three
speakers. Harvard has the choice
of sides on the question, which will
be: "Resolved, that tho power of
the railroad corporations in the Uni
ted States should be further limited
by national legislation."
