# Ready to Line Up.
## MINOR DETAILS OF THE GAME SETTLED UPON. The 						Excursion Trains, Coaches, Theatre Party, Grounds, and Division of Seats all Arranged for Saturday. 
### 
From day to day rumors of the
arrangements for Saturday's game
have been tloating about, but little
was known positively till today.
The committee for Stanford con
sisted of Champlin, lira well, and
Moulton, and that of 6 1 »erkeley was
A. (}. Laug. Any amount of
patient but been
done by our committee, and they are
to bo highly complimented on the
successful fulfillment of their ardu
ous duties. Berkeley men are
doubtless fair but they drive a sharp
bargain and it takes skill and diplo
macy to work with'thera. Our men
have been wary and watchful and
everything'now'seems to bo ready
to go oft' without a hitch. In de
tail the arrangments are reported by
the committee as follows:
The H light street baseball
grounds have been engaged as an
nounced, and the goal posts in the
Fame position as last year. Around
the field has been placed a, wire
picket fence to keep spectators from
interfering with the players. The
grand stand behind the north goal
ban 1300 reserved seats,, which by
the way were sold almost as soon
as they woro offered lor sale and
great demands mado for more,
lioth Berkeley and Stanford con
tended for the bleachers and a com
promise was made in Stanford's
favor by which 700 seats to the
right of the grand stand were given
to Stanford and the 500 to our left
given to Berkeley. To tho right of
the grand stand are 700 more of our
scats and to cur light will wave the
blue and gold. The boxes have
been taken by tho prominent clubs
of the city. The largest was engaged
by the Japaneso Consul who will
bring to the game the officers of the
.Japanese man-of-war anchored in
the harbor. The University Club
baa 500 soats for its mombers and
each member will decorato a part q,f
the stand with a Hag from his col- j
lege. Flags are being made for this
purpose for Harvard, Yale, Prince
ton, Columbia, Brown, Michigan,
Dartmouth, Bowdoin, Amherst, and
other American colleges and also for
(krman, French, Italian, and Span
ish universities. This display will
perhaps bo the finest on the grounds

■ It will certainly bo the most interest
ing. Every ticket of admission to
the game is accompanied l>y a ticket
to the particular part of the grounds
which the spectator is entitled. For
the Universities red and blue con
pons have been provided.
Coach positions were tlio subject
of considerable dispute. Wo won
tho toss aud took choice of the po
sitions. Concerning coaches it may
bo mentioned that there are yet a
few available ones that can be had
upon application to (Jruwell. Paul
sen will take his big bus to tho city
Friday night, and our boys ought to
see that it receives patronage, for
Paulsen has shown us many favors.
The matter of charging for ladies
and for coaches was tho subject of
another dispute, Berkeley not want
ing to charge for ladies, and Stan
ford wanting to charge for coaches.
A compromise was made by not
chargiug for coaches but charging
for ladies. Only live police could be
obtained for preserving order on the
grounds. From the increasing in
terest taken, it seems that more than
10,000 people will see the game.
At, 7 :230 Saturday morning the
train ot fifteen cars will run up to
the quadrangle, where it will be dec
orated under the direction of Flint,
'0(5. It; will leave at 8:230, sharp, and
make a quick run into the city, fol
lowed by the San .loso special. This
latter train was obtained by the
guarantee of 2300 tickets to be sold
from San -Jose at 81.30 for the round
trip Over 200 arc sold already.
Our tickets cost $1.00, and are good
to return on any train Sunday. On
tho two trains there will bo about
1100 people, most of whom will get
oil' at Valencia street, where cable
cars are provided for 1000. These
cars aro to be decorated with our
colors.
It is not definitely settled whon
the team will leave to #o into the
city, but it is rumored that they will
leave on Friday evening. In San
Francisco our headquarters will bo
at the Palace Hotel, which will be
decorated with our colors. The
Berkeley team will have their head
quarters at the Occidental Hotel.
In the matter of advertising, the
committee has had much of its work
done by the newspapers, who find
that the public take enough interest
in the game, so they liavo given a
good deal of reading matter concern
ing the contest. About $150 has
been expended in printing placards
and poders. Tho placards have
been placed in the shop windows of
the neighboring cities. Tho railroad
company has sent tho posters to in
terior counties, and had thorn postod.

The Shreves,manufacturing jewelers,
have placed tho trophy on exhibition
in their window. Raphael has two
wax figures dressed in football suits
in his window, and the Carnall,
Hopkins Co. aro exhibiting an im
mense fish horn in front of their
place of bu iness. All these items
have attracted considerable atten
tion, and made it unnecessary to ad
vertise extensively,
The committee has had the most
difficulty in the matter A tho theater
party. There was evidence that
Mock well's Theater had made it a
personal inducement t.o the Berkeley
committee to got the party there.
The play is not at all suited to the
purpose of such a party, even if the
theatre were. Mr. Lang hold firm
in the determination of going to
Stock well's ami our committee de
cided that it would be best to stop
all further consideration with them
and provide a party for ourselves.
Someone here has received tickets
from Mr Lang for Stockwell's and
some few have boon sold. Those
who attend will find themselves in a
Sierkeley theatre party. Mr. Gottloh
of the California Theatre was seen
last night and sold 200 tickets in the
dross cirdo to the Stan ibid football
association. las. F. Powers in tho
Mad Bargain is tho attraction and
those who have seen it say that it is
good and well fitted for our purpose.
The box sheet will be down to day
and Whit tier, '023, will have charge
of the sale of seats. The team will
occupy the stage boxes and the affair
will be entirely a Stanford ono.
