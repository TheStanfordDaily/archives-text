Some of the Chemistry students
complain of their not having an op
portunity to consult reference books
in chemistry, all of which are kept,
in Professor Stillman's oflice, which
is closed in the evening. The only
time that these students, who do
laboratory work in the afternoon
and recite in the forenoon, have for
such research is when the oflice is
closed. Why can not the oflice bo
opon in the evening, or the books
transferred to the library, or dupli
cates secured and placed in the li
brary?
