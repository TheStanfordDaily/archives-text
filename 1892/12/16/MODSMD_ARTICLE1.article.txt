# THE

"Bet on Walter Camp's team. It
will win beyond all shadow of doubt.
He is a wizard and no matter what
are odds against his team, it is
b mnd to be victorious." So writes a
Harvard man lo one of our men.
We haven't the confidence in the
"Father of Football" out here to
think that defeat to our team is im
possible and that is, perhaps the
reason why so few of our men have
followed the Harvard man's advice
about betting. .lust on the eve be
fore battle there is asurpressed nerv
ous feeling tl at is not fear nor is it
confidence. Every one feels a hope
that we may win but no one is con
fident. We all know the glaring de
lects and faults in our team and are
aware that these points weak in n>
are strong in the Berkeley team
"Our men fire 100 light," is said anx
iously scores of times to-day. "But
they are quick and strong," seems to
be the expression taken as an anti
dote. Last night was the last prac
tice game and the many fumbles did
not insure more confidence. After
the practice Walter Camp look the
train for San Francisco and left the
team in the hands of the captain and
manager.
For some reason the time of de
parture of the team was kept se
cret. It.was noticed that the mem
bers wese in confusion, packing
suits, sweaters, shoes, and other
paraphernalia, directly after break
fast this morning and it was not un
til after ten o'clock and they had
gone that any ouo had a definite
notion of its movements. They will
go to the Palace Hotel and stay till
the afternoon when they will be
taken out and and practiced on
turf grounds to accustom them to
playing on th > Haight street
grounds. The Berkeley team will
go to the Occidental Hotel this after
noon. In the evening they will go
to the theatre This they do to di
vert their minds from the exciting
suspense which each one feels. The
lax on the energy which any player,
especially a nervous one, receives on
t he day preceeding t his gune cannot
be imagined. Both teams will play
more football in I heir minds to-day
than they would in a dozen games
like that of to morrow.
La-1. year the team was picked a
long time before the game, bull this
year no one knows absolutely who
will play the positions yet. although
most can guess pretty accurately.
Fifteen men went to San Francisco
this morning and from these fifteen

tlie eleven will lie chosen. They
are Barnhisel, Briggs, Rich, Coch
ran, r. Downing, Field, Cletnans,
Patterson, Frankenheimer, ltairel
son, Kennedy, Wilson, Orcutt, C.
Downing, "Whitehouse, ami Walton
From these it is safe to assert that
Barnhisel will play center; Brings
and Orcutt, guards; Rich and Coch
ran, tackles; Wilson and Franken
heimer, ends; Code, quarter back;
Clemans and Paul Downing, half
backs; Kennedy, full back. It is
probable that this will be the line
up but it may be that P. Downing
will replace Orcutt as guard and
Walton take Downing's place as half
back. This arrangement would add
six pounds of weight to the center of
the line. In case of accident in the 1
center of the line, Whitehouse, Pat
terson, or Field will be put in as
substitutes. In a similar accident
to tackles or ends, 0. Downing or
Walton nan be put in. Walton and
Harrelson will be substitute j for
behind the line.
Last night the team was stripped
and weighed in Kncina gymnasium.
Their weights and ages are us fol
lows:
NAME WEIGHT AGE
Barnhisel 170 23
Briggs 170 27
liich 170 25
Cochran 171 18
P. Downing 173 19

Wilson 153 22
Orcutt 17<> 22
C. Downing I<>l 20
Whitehouse 158 IS
Walton 1 03 21
The combined weight is 2405 lbs,,
and the average we : ght is IG4A lis
The average age is 21 years.
We cannot speak so accurately as
to the choice of the Berkeley team.
No reliable statistics concerning
their weights can be obtained
Hunt, the captain and half back,
weighs 180 pounds. A. B. Pierce
tips the beam at 195. lie plays
right guard. .) O. Pierce, the ci li
ter, weighs 17*> pounds. Sherman,
the left guard, weighs 180 pounds.
Renson, the quarter back, weighs
128 pounds.
When the teams are lined up we
will have a chanco to see what
weight will do against agility and
speed. Nothing is now left but to
play the game, and that will begin
to-morrow at 2:15.
