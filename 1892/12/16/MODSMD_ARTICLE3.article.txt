## 
### 
When tho present management
took hold o'' (lie Dait.y Palo Alto,
it was understood that no paper
would bo issued during vacations,
on holidays, or duiing the ast week
of the semester. This Inst regulation
is io provide a chance for the editors
to devote their undivided attention
to the work of reviewing for exami
nations. It was thought that the
proposed constitution for the run
ning of the paper could be printed
this week, but owing to the work of
the Approaching game the commit
tee, consisting of Wilson, Clemans,
and Moulton, have been unable to
report, A constitution will he pre
sented during the c mung week, and
the provisions for the election of
next semester's editors and mana
gers be decided. No definite call
for a meeting of' the Associated
Students cum l>e made in this issue.
Such a notice will be posted on the
bulletin board, and it is necessary
for tho successful continuation of
this paper that as many as possible
attend the meeting.
