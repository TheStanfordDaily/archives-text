With tlris issue ccases the pub
lishing of the Daily Pat,o Alto for
the first term of its existence. The
present editor and manager find
their term of office at an end, and
here a few words on retiring nmy
not be out of place. No one needs
to be reminded of the establishment,
of this paper The time of ifs
birth is less than three months in
the past. The incidents connected
with its birth are fresh in the minds
of those who proposed and those
who opposed it. When a few of us
ventured to suggest that such an
undertaking was a good one and
beneficial for the best interests of
the University, we were met by the
opposition of that more conserva
tive class of individuals which are
found in every department of life,
and who, if they do not perform
that admirable function of restrain
ing the visionary and foolhardy,
often defeat good innovations of
the venturous. The opposition
with which our enterprise met, we
are happy to say, came from that
conservative class almost entirely,
and not from factional elements
with a political end in view. This
is evident from the fact that when
the Daily Palo Ar/ro slowly forged
its way to the front the opposition
melted away and became our firm
support. In the first, editorial it was
said that "there is no demand fora
daily paper in this University but
there is a field for it." There was
just the point of contention between
us and the opposition; the opposi
tion say we have proved our point
The difficulty outside was greater
than that inside the University.
Advertisers are shy of new papers,
especially of those started on as slim
a foundation as this. Subscribers
will not pay in advaneo fora paper
the continuance of which they
doubt. There was no printing preps
this side of Redwood City, and this,
if it is no obstruction to a woekly,
it is most apparently so to a daily.
Worse than all this there was not n
single student on the staff who had
had any experience or much of an
idea of what a college daily should
be. So if the subscribers in look
ing over their files find some num
bers of tliis semester not exactly
what the numbers of next semester

are, let them into considera
tion Homo of these points.
One of the hardest problems wo
had to nolvo was that of distribution.
It was a problem which time could
not solve. The difficulty presented
lo us a need to the University which
has been presented to others none
the less strongly. That need is a
postoffice. When we are obliged
to pend between three and four
hundred copies of the paper to sub
scribers through the mail, we have a
chance to see the frequency with
which the mail goes astray. The
fault has not beon our own in a
large number of cases, but the fault
of the inefficient mail service wlv'ch
wo all have to put up with.
It has been much disputed what
should be the nature of the matter
that goes into a college daily. There
is always news of some sort to be
used in filling up, but the criterion
to which a news item has been sub
jected is not that of whether it will
fill up space. An itenVmust be of
interest to a number of readers be
fore it ought to appear in any paper,
and the judgment capable of passing
such a sentence is not possessed by
ninny. The editor must have it as a
pre-eminently marked characteristic,
lie must know the habits, thoughts,
and feelings of his readers, f and must
pander to their tastes. You can't
satisfy everybody who reads your
paper. You must look to it that
you satisfy a majority. A popular
journal is a good index to the moral
tone, habits, and tastes of any com
munity.
One subscriber facetiously sug
gests that we change the name of
the paper to the "Daily Football."
Another who receives Lis paper
through the mail suggests the name
the "Next, Daily Football." These
were not football enthusiasts. If we
read the signs of the times correctly,
the majority of our readers favor the
prominence given to football.
Taking all of these points into
consideration, readers of this paper
will have some idea of the work done
to make it wlnt it is. Then add to
this the fact that the editors and
managers have been carrying on
their studies the same as other stud
ents, and it will be evident that we
have not been idle. We leave the
paper in a good condition to our
subscribers. With money in the
bank, with a score of experienced
assistants, and with all minor de
tails systematized, the work of our
successors ought t.j be comparatively
easy. It is needless to say hero that
wo wish success to the enterprise
which we have spent so many hours
in starting.
