# Receipts of the Stanford-U.C. Game.
## 
### 
The total gate receipts at the
game ou Dec 17 th were £7200. This
sum i> very disappointing when the
great crowd that was present on
that day is taken into consideration.
That some sort of fraud was perpe
trated is evident, but to what extent
is not known. Sufficient precau
tions were taken and those who had
charge of the arrangements ought
not to be blamed. A detective has
been employed and every endeavor
is being made to ferret out the short
comings.
A committee of two from the fac
ulty of each University together
with the presidents of the two stu
dent bodies will audit the accounts
as ?oon as possible.
