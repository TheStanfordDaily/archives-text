There is no question that the man
agement of the football team carries;
with it nio!e responsibility and hard
work than any other position con
nected with the student body. T1
increased interest and importance
centered in the game this year and
the unsyetematised state of affairs
made the office one doubly hard to
till. To one unitiated to the inner
workings and duties connected with
ti e managership, the magnitude of
the task is unrealized. Last vear
when the game was comparatively
undeveloped the work was not
neaily so great nor the position so
responsible. As the game approaches
the importance of (astern contests,
the supervision and list ot' expenses
must necessarily keep pace. The
Hu vard and Vale bills tooted away
up in the thousands while even con
servative Cornell came out in debt
something like a thous; n 1 dollars
this yeo'. To procu c the lust of
con li sin the country, to provide
the men with complete outfits, to
play games abroad, and to pay the
bills disectly incident to the team
cost mtuey find moie than most
people suppc sÂ°. In a lecent talk,
the mam g r of the Ferkeley team
stated that their expei ses would be
at Ist three i Ik us md dollar-. Our
outlay will i.ofc reach that eum but
of necessity will be h rge. However,
when theaccoun sine audited a neat
litt e sum will be fox nd to our credit,

which is comforting considering the
condition of our p.thleties grounds.
To take all in all our present man
ager and his assistants, after all
their sacrifi e of college duties and
pangs of anxiety and care, are to be
congratulated on a very successful
completion of the second football
season in our history.
