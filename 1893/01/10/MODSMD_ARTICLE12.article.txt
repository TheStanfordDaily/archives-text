Commencement Day at Chicgao.
When is the University at Chicago
to have its commencement day ? It
is understood that men and women
may present themselves for examina
tion for degrees and for graduation
at four different times of the year.
By a vote of the board of trustees
taken on Thursday last, it was de
cided to hold what shall be cnl'ed a
University Convocation, on the first
evening of eveiy quarter. At this
meeting, which will be an official
meeting of the university, degrees
will be conferred, honors will be be
stowed, announcements of fellow
ships aud scholarships and of new
members of the faculty will be made.
The first University Convocation
will be held Jan. 2, 1893. It will
not be, I take it, the custom of the
university to have addresses by those
who are graduating, but rather an
address by some person not in resi
dence at the university, on some
theme of general interest. — Univer
