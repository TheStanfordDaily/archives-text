# December, '92, Class Book of the O.H.S.
## 
### 
The December, '92, class of the
Oakland High School has issued a
class book that is in every way a
credit to the class which publishes
it, and to the institution from which
it emanates. It contains among
other things a history of the school,
the courses of instruction, and a list
of the students; an account of the
various societies and organizations,
including the Aegis Publishing Com
pany, the Gamma Eta Fraternity,
the debating and scientific societies,
and the Glee Club. Athletics evi
dently tigure prominently among
the school's achievements, and in
deed their record in the four A's is
one of which they may well feel
proud.
Numerous cartoons admirably ex
ecuted by a member of the class,
photographs of the class and of the
athletic teams, together with several
excellent cuts of Stanford University
also enliven its pages. The school
graduates classes in May and Decem
ber, thirty-sixgraduating last month.
The grade of university work is
after all but commensurate with the
grade of work done in preparatory
schools, and we must all feel a
hearty interest in the success of
schools like the 0. 11. S.
