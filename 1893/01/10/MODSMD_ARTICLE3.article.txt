# An Invention by a Stanford Student.
## 
### 
Clyde Patterson, special in mechan
ical engineering, has been working
on a new inimical instrument which
promises well to bring the invention
in some prominence with the manu
facturers of musical instruments.
Patterson bns been very successful
in making mandolins ami guitais
which are recognized as very super
ior in tone and finish, llis work in
this line ltd him to a speculation on

combining the mandolin and guitar
into a single instrument, which
should have all the delicacy in tone j
of a mandolin a ill yet the volume of
a gui'ar. He began to put his idea
into a concrete form last summer by
making the drawings of such an in
strument. lie was diverted from
his original intention, and the in
strument which he is now complet
ing is entirely a new one in this line.
The instrument, for which a patent
has been asked, is to be called the
mandolin-guitar. It is similar in
shape to the mandolin, but mucb
larger. In length it is 36 inches,
and has a bowl the same shape as a
mandolin. The bowl is IS inches
long, by 13 inches wide, and 11
inches deep. The neck is I s inches
long, and similar to that of a guitar.
The head differs from that of a guitar
in that it in larger, and on the base
side enlarged and made in the shape
of a scroll, to which is attached two
strings for contra bass. There are
eight strings on the fingerboard, six
of them similar t.o a guitar's strings.
By an arrangement of the finger
board these strings can be thrown
double and the instrument become
a bass mandolin, being tuned an
octave lower than a mandolin. In
tone it is similar to the Italian harp,
being sweeter and more mellow than
the guitar, and at the same time
louder and more penetrating. Sev
eral musicians have seen the djsign
and have pronounced it a Fucce«s.
The firm of Win. G Badger in San
Francisco have taken charge of its
introduction. Lyon & Healy, of
Chicago, will manufacture the in
strument.
