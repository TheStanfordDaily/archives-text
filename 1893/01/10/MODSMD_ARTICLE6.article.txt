# Our Law Department.
## 
### 
In line with tlie general ft d van or
ment and progress of our University
conies the new Department of Law.
This course will be similar to the
others in that the degree given will
be the same—the degree of law be
ing reserved for those who have com
pleted a college course either here
or elsewhere.
The woik will not be wholly inde
pendent but closely allied to that
done in history or political science.
A. student may make law his major
or take a certain number of hours of
it as a minor work. It is not the
aim to encourage students who are
not graduates of colleges to come
here and take law alone.
By this means the course is placed
upon a higher plane and keeps out a
large class who study the profession
without havirg taken the necessary
previous training.
The first year's work will be de
voted to tVe elements of the science
along with a thorough drill in r-on
stitutional and international law.
The second year will be taken up
with advanced studies usually per
sued in ordinary law courses.
Prof. Ernest W. Huffeut of the
North Western Law School of Chi
cago is the fortunate man chosen to
take charge of the department and
indeed we as students should feel
ourselves fortunate as being eligible
to his instruction-.
Prof. Hufflcut is a native of New
York and a graduate of Cornell Uni
versity in both the literary and law
courses. lie was fora time-an in
structor there in English.
He is noted as an excellent teach
er, and as a practicioner at the bar
;at Minneapolis h? has made a tine
record. He is a ready writer and is
a frequent contributor to journals of
law and political science. As a lect
urer he has a high reputation.
Ex-President White of Cornell
now TJ. 8. Minister to .Russia ap
pointed Prof. Iliiffcut as Chary
<1 "jjnir* at St. Petersburg—this po
sition he did not accept, prefering
the more permanent one at Chicago.
With such an able man at the
head of this very important depart
ment of our college work and a de
partment that will in all probability
draw in a large number of students
it is very likely that this University
will furnish a large quota of law
yers for the western states.
As to the coming of President
Harrison ns a non-resident lecturer
nothing can be definitely stated
since 110 decision will be reached
until after consultation with Senator
Stanford. That he will come how
ever is very probable.
