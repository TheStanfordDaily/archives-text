# Salaried Managers.

### 
Caspar W. Whitney has this to
say ill Harper's Weekly about the
University of Pennsylvania's recent
departure from ordinary college cus-'
torn in securing a paid manager to
look after their athletic interests.
He says: •■With all the commend
able progression in its athletic de
partments, it seems a pity the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania should mar
the good work by the engagement of
a 'salaried manager whose business
will be to manage the various ath
letic teams.' There can be no two
opinions on tho subjoct among those
whose sole interest in the matter is
the welfare of pure college sport.
A professional manager of college
athletic teams is a hazardous prece
dent, to say the very least of it. To
begin with, it is giving college sport
an unwho'esome lecognitiou; and 1
do not wish to be misunderstood in
making such a stricture. No one
can possibly be a more earnest advo
cate of college sport than I am. By
personal experience, and from close
observation and study, I know that
a legitimate indulgence in athletics
is a panacea for the mental and
physical impoverishment of the un
dergraduate. It is a tonic to the
student; it builds up the muscles of
the weakling, and gives courage and
decision to the timorous It makes
manly boys, and gives us men of |
action. But there is no denying
the tact that the prominence given j
athletics in our colleges to-day has !
become a serious question. There
is a possibility of killing the golden
egg-laying goose, and in my opinion
the 'salaried manager' comes very
near to getting the verdict."
