# The
						Miracle Play.

Professor Hudson lectured last
evening on "The Miracle Play." He
began by giving an extended ac
count of the early religious drama,
tracing its growth from a dreary, |
desert waste, to the development in
the modern theater. Comparatively
little is known of its history, but
what is is extremely valuable, for
without this knowledge to perfectly
understand the Shakespearean
drama would be impossible.
These early religious dramas
contained thought drawn from the
race, were the everyday life of the
people, even embodied their man
ners and customs, all their hopes,
fears, and aspirations. In this it wasj

unlike the Greek drauia which con
cerned itself more with heroes and
places. The spirit of the times suf
fuses the religious drama through
and through. To thoroughly under
stand it we mu3t trace it back to its
very cradle, from an unsuspected
germ until it rises into the later
powerful institution. The church
was the parent of the religious'
drama. The church of that time
took charge of everything, was the
one great dominant institution of
the centuries, was the center of all
social and intellectual life, bacame
for the masses a powerful comforter
and friendâ€”in reality was"the very
home of the people." The early
church has the germs of dramatic
talents. The early mass contained
all the essentials of the drama,
even partook of an epic character. '
The inherent germs were dormant
for ages but in the 10th century
burst forth and worked out their
logical results. A wave of enthu
siasm and revival swept over
Europe. The ritual expanded into
almost indefinite growth and clergi
cal mystery. The texts of scripture
were amplified, elaborate dialogue
grew up on this, vocal and instru
mental mu-iic, lyrical and spectac-;
ular plays were introduced. Eccle
siastical fetes, sculpture, painting
and architecture, became general.
Dialogues such as 3lary unfolding
the resurrection in reply to the ques
tions of the angels, and where choir
answers choir, became prevalent.
Other texts of the scriptures were
widely departed from. The narra
tive and spectacular gradually be
came fused in the 11th century.
Priests and choristers as yet had
only their simple parts, individual
ties were yet to emerge. Later
actual dramatisation began with all
needed accessories of real objects
which lead to the natural develop-1
ment of the church services from
pictures to living tableaux. Thus |
the religious drama grew, with,
the church fora stage and the
priosts for the actois.
At this stage it was evident the
drama could not long remain bound
up with the church. Thisexpansion
soon made it an accompaniment, not
a part of the services. Then the
scene of action was removed from
the interior to the exterior. On fete
days great crowds witnessed long
and elaborate plays, removed from
the alter to the open air. At the
fair 3, places of commerce and
merriment, the plays were even
taken from the church porch to the
streets. Public and private exhibi
tions were held side by side. The
entrance to the Augustan Age is,

marked. Episodes of sacred his
tory are elaborated into comp'ete
cycles of human destiny. The birth
life, and death of Christ, the Garden
of Eden, the Exodus from Egypt,
War in Heaven, Downfall of the
Angels, Creation of the Earth, are
seized upon as materials with a
strange mingling of the devilish
and the divine. With wonderful
freedom they take up the supernat
ural in a treatment intense and pro
saic, knowing nothing of modern
hesitation in such matters. But
through it all the human element
was forcing itself to the front. The
structure was human while the back
ground was beyond humanity. The
masses made no generalizations,
simple belief existed everywhere and
there was no shock from incongru
ity. Heaven and hell were the
great essential elements. The con.
test was between God and Satau
with the world for the battlefield
and the human soul the prize for
which they fought. Modern deli
cacy would have been shocked. The
Deity contained all the human frail
ties. Harshness and vindictiveness
appears at every stage, amid an at
mosphere of prevailing gloom
Every detail of torture and cruelty
were dwelt upon with exactness.
The devil was the important charac
ter, around whom clustered the
great events of the drama. In
himself half ludrioous and half terri
ble, he was a strange character.
Thus in a wonderful mingling of
comedy and tragedy we see Satan
retrograde from the great accuser,
adversary, to stage clown of later
drama.
From this primitive religious
drama, where the stage was the
church, the actors the priests, and
the first play the mass, a slow evo
lution took place, until the English
drama is reached and the drama
passes from the clergy to the sec
ular classes. Morality plays arise
as rivals. The stage possesses less
of theology and more of the world.
It was a far reaching change, sweep
ing away old land marks. Art, lit
erature, and science were beginning
to llourish. Inspirations of art
were veering around from the relig
ious to the secular. The age of
simple belief was passing away.
Prejudices and narrow views were
giving away to the enlargement of
freedom.
The Euglish drama is our
golden heritage of the ages. Then
let us, thrilled by its beauty, im
pressed by its grandeur, take every
advantage of our legacy as it grows
richer, rarer, and more beautiful
with the years.
