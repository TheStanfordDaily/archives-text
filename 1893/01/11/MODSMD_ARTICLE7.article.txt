The Argonaut in a very able arid
lengthy article advocates an inherit
ance tax on California's millionaires.
This is following the plan for rais
ing revenue inaugurated in England
in 1796 and adopted by New York
and s,oiue other states The Gould
heirs would pay $600,000 of tbis
kind of a tax. As the state throws a
safeguard around the money man, it
is certainly just and reasonable thxt
the state receive a part of his accu
mulated wealth.

It is very pleasant to see new stu
dents coming into Encina. The re
duction in the price of living causes
many to change their abode and
come where the crowd is. By stu
dents being together there is gener
ated a kindlier feeling toward each
other and considerable enthusiasm
added to college life. With good
rooms, regular hours, plain food —
which is generally associated with
high thinking—nearness to the
quadrangle, and now having the
swing of the work, college life
should be enjoyable aud lead to
much improvement.

If there if any valuable training
that should be given at tLis institu
tion that is not receiving fair
share of attention, it certainly is the
training in the line of ability to speak
in public. This might be brought
about by different plans and various
orginizations. The Congress isper
haps one of the best mediums for
the student bodv to attain this end,
for it takes up live issues. Why it
has been permitted to fall behind
the standing it should have is a per
plexing question. It may be that
too much has been going on in the
latter part of the week. Early this
vearthe presidential campaign meet
ings broke in on the work to a great
extent, but now the gte.it campaign
is over. Many of the boys lived at
a distance from the quadrangle, but
now they are coming in. Another
reason perhaps remains, that keeps
many out of all kinds of literary
work, and that is the amount of orig
inal research ami independent inves
tigation required by r» g dar col
lege course—this may make our sit
uation a little different from those
uho are not permitted to do such
work and get crtd i for the burnt

in many colleges —but yet this only
takes tlie place largely of literary es
say work and cannot be substituted
for public speaking. Considering
the better opportunities that many
students have and the great advan
tages of the work, does it not seem
reasinable that there could and
should be a real live Congress this
semester ? For instauce the ques
tion of immigration is demanding
much a'tention among our represen- j
tatives and senatois, and why should i
we not follow in line with the spirit
of the times? We are near a great
city which is in touch with the
daily happenings of national life and
thus we can keep abreast with the top
ics of the day. This University is
looked upon above all others as the
exponent of practical education. I
Can it be practical in all respects
without giving the student a drill in
speech making? The man who can
think on his feet and make a neat
speech has great influence in this j
world. Practice 'may not make per
fect bat it may make one master of
his surroundings and capable of act
ing wisely in emergencies. Let Con- j
gress be revived, enthusiastically
carried on, and eveiy enterprising
student who expects to say some
thing to the world after a while will
become a member, and when in
years later he attains prominence
due to his early work done here,
credit and honor well be reflected
upon Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity.
