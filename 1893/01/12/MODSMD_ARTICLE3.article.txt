# Stanford Boat Club.
## 
### 
There will be a meeting of this
club Friday, January 13th, at 7:30
p.m., in room 50, quadrangle. At
this meeting the officers of the club
will be elected, final action taken in
regard to the boat house, bids for
which have been received; and steps
taken to secure an eight oared boat.
This is an important meeting and
the success of the club will depend
largely upon the action taken and
spirit manifested in it. Ail those in
terested in the success of the club
should be present.
When action is taken upon the
names already presented for admis
sion ihe active membership roll will
number about one hundred, but it
-hould be live or six hundred, ami it
is earnestly desiied that all those
who wish to join sometime, hand in
their names at ouce, aud thus as
sist in the early procurement of the
necessary equipments, instead of
waiting until these are all obtained.
This branch of athletics is one of
the most important in all the lead
ing universities of the country and
now the opportunity is at hand for
its successful establishment here,
and the advantages posessed for
practice, due to the climate, should
enable Stanford's crew in the near
future to place its record with the
best.
To do this the co operation of all
in the University is necessary.
Having this it will be possible, in a
comparatively short time aud with
little efVort, to reach a position,
which, with but few inter
ested, must necessarily demand a
long time and much labor.
Remember this meeting will be
held to-morrow ni^ht.
