# Remarks on Higher Education.
## 
### 
The following, taken from a speech
by the late George William Curtis
on the value of liberal education, is
quoted by President Oilman of
Johus Hopkins in his last report to
the trustees:
"1 have heard it said that liberal
education does not promote success
in life. A chimney sweep might say
so. Without education he could
gain the chimney top, poor little
blackamoor! brandish his brush and
sing his *ong of escape from soot to
sunshine. But the ideal of success
measures the worth of the remark
that it may be attained without lib
eral education. If the accumulation
of money be the standard, we must
admit that a man might make a for
tune iu a hundred ways without ed

ucation EiT. Le could make a for
tune, also, without j uriiy of life, or
noble character, or lofiy faith. A
mau can pay much 100 a price
for money, and not every man who
buys it knows its relative value with
other po-sesions. Undoubtedly
Ezra Cornell and Matthew \ assar
did not go to college, find then suc
ceeded in life. But their success,
what was it? Wheie do you see it
now? Surely not in their riches,
but in the respect that tenderly
cherishes their memory, because,
knowing its inestimable value they
gave to others the opportunity of
education which had been denied
them. Remembering that the great
ministry of education is not to make
the body more comfortable, but the
soul happier, may the University in
all its departments and activities
cherish and promote education not
for its lower uses but for its higher
influences."
