Germany which cannot be found in
any other university in the United
States. Several of these are new to
scientific mineralogy. The following
are some of the most important:
From Boihm & Wiederman, n
set of axis models of crystals tor-

Hamburg, Germany, a set of sect
ions of minerals to be used in tbe
study of mineral optics; from Dr.

descriptive mineralogy; from L.
