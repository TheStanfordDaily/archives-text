The I'ninr.<!ty Jf<i>/(c.ini , ot New
York, a publication devoted to
the general interests of all higher
sea's of learning, contains in each is
sue letters from the leading uni
versities of the United States.
Stanford is not, as yet, represented.
Here is an opportunity for some
enterprising student to help the
University, and himself at the same
time. The Chicago Inter Ocean,
the New York Evening J'osf, and
other eastern papers also contain
college letters from time to time,
and they would no doubt be glad to
secure Stanford correspondents.
Such opportunities as these for
reaching prospective students must
not be neglected if we would draw
our fair share of would-be colle
gians.
