THURSDAY, JAN. 12, 1893.

A prominent newspaper proprietor
of Sau Francisco Las become inter
ested in the strategy of football, and
has evolved a new play which will
doubtless brinjf him renown similar
to that acquired by Mr. Delland, of
Boston, originator of the flying
wedge. lie has discovered that the
element of surprise is the one thiug
lacking in the symmetrical develop
ment of a football game; and the
formation he proposes is that of a
hollow square, with a pass from the
man in the center to the one on the
outside corner of the square. The
TJ. C. team is to experiment with the
play It will be our duty to be as
surprised as possible.

We are glad to be able to inform
our readers tba r the D\ii,y I'alo
Alto commences tbe second seme*-
ter with a largely increased iist of
subscribers. Such an evidence of
the good will of the students is a
source of much gratification to the
° i
editors and business manager of the j
paper. From being a mere project
in the mrnda of a few four months I
ago, it has become an acrive, and, we j
hope, an essential factor in our stu
dent body organism. It was no easy
then to obtain enough sub
scribers to warrant the issue of the j
paper; the change from skepticism j
to confidence tells us, therefore,
that the course of the paper has
been, on the whole, satisfactory to i
the students. The publication of ai
daily paper must always involve cer
tain sacrifices 011 the part of some. 1
The benefits of such a publication to;
the students and to the University
itself are so obvious a* to need no
mentiou. And we are glad to add
that we believe the spirit of our stu
dents to be such that few could be
found unwilling to make the neces
sary sacrifice for the sake of the
University.

Sometime ngo a committee was ap
pointed by the student body to en
quire inti the advisability of organ
izing a student's guiM. As a report
from this committee should be forth
coming in the near future, it may be
well for the students to have in
mind some of tie advantages such
an orgauizatk n wo.ild be to their
in'er.sts in ord-.r that they may v.te

intelligently when the matter comes
up. Its main object is to provide
for the care and relief of students
who fall sick while attending the
University, the expenses of which to
be defrayed by an of
from fifty cents to one dollar a year
on all the students. To those of
us who have never been afflicted
with sickness heretofore, and who
feel no prescience of such a misfor
tune, such an organization is apt, on
first thoughts, to seem entirely un
necessary. But if we stop to recall
the few cases of severe illness that
have occuired among us, we can see
how they might all have been vastly
relieved by the presence of a stu
dent's guild iu our midst; perhaps,
even, iu one instance the life of the
sufferer might have been saved.
That Encina, though withal very
: quiet fora dormitory, is no place
fora doctor's patient, must be read
ily apparent. The necessary build
ing would cost about four thousand
dollars, to build which we must
have help from outsiclo parties.
Student's guilds exist at Cornell,
Wellesley, Smith, and other colleges
where they have been found highly
snccessfu'. It is for the students to
decide whether it is.advisable to
undertake one here.
