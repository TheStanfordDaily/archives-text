# The
						Regatta in Chicago.
## 
### 
Much enthusiasm is being aroused
in collegiate circles over the con
templated regatta at the World's
Fair next summer. All the promi
nent eastern colleges will put crews
iu the field. Comtll is more thun
enthusiastic as she thinks n great
chance is cft^r*d to meet \ale and
Harvard who so repeatedly have re
fused to meet her on the water. An
invitation is open to Stanford, and
from all indications at present it
looks as though the enthusiasm that
has been promoted will not result in
an ineffectual attempt to organize a
boat club Below we give a letter
lately received from Commodore
Cregier of tha Chicago Navy:
Chicago, J<in. 1, 1893.
President Jordan, Stanford Uni
versity, Palo Alto, Cal
Dear Sir: â€”The Chicago Navy will
hold its Seventh Annual Regatta in
Chicago next season iu July or
August, and as it will be an inter
esting feature of the "World's Co
lutnbian Exposition, it is very much
desired that the leading college
crews of this country and of Europe
should take a leading part; as it is
an international affair all amateur
rowing organizations of the United
States Canada, aud Europe, ir is
expected, will bs represented. The
races will be rowed over a splendid
course, and the best of accomoda
tions will be furnished for the care
of boats and oarsmen during their
stay iu Chicago.
Handsome gold medals will be
given to the winning crews accom
panied by a beautiful silken banner.
Please let me hear from you what
inducements it will be necessary to
make to secure your college crew.
Hoping you will favor me with are
ply at your earliest convenience, I
remain, \ery truly yours,
Dewitt C. Cregier, Commodore.
