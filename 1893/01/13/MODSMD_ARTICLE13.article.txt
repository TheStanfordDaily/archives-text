A. A Zimmerman, the well known
cycler, won sixty-six lirst prizes,
eight seconds, and live thirds dur
ing the past season
Macmillan & Co. have published
"The Elements of Graphic Statics,"
by L. M. Hoskins, Professor of Ap
plied Mathematics in t! e Stanford
I'niversity. The book is intended
a> an elementary text-book for the
use of students of engineering. The
author deals with the general theory
of forces, stresses in simple struct
ures, and centroidrf and moments of
inertia, but has avoided problems in
volving the theory of elasticity. The
use of higher mathematics has been
avoided as much as possible, and the
book is clear and explicit. It should
serve admirably as an elementary
text book.—Scotsman (Edinburgh).
