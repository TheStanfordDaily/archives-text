TtiEiiK t:e few educated men and
women who do not at some time
find it convenient to express them
selves in pi int. To do this in an
intelligible and pleasing stvle is not
l>y any means as eisy us 112 illing off
a log. There is considerable differ
ence between writing an essay for
the class in English Composition
and an article for the printer. Yet
even our respect for those having
charge of the only required course
in the Univeisity cannot forbid tin
expression of the opinion that the
drill in wiring for these columns is
us v;du Â»ble as that g lined under
their tuition.
All 3'u en's are invited
t<) become contrib Uoim to tie
IV\lo Alto. Those having a desire
to rep t',e u 1 btndit of the advan
tages of their uui\ersity career will
nee I no h-< ond invitation. None
i eed lies tate for fear that nil the
places on the stuff will be filled b -

fote they get on Theie is always
room at the top. A new Editor in
chief will be elected next year ami
somebody will feel sore who never
wrote a line for print. The same
students will blame their luck in
the future because they cannot re
spoud to an invitation to contribute
to some more pretentious publica
tion. It should be a matter ol
pride to assist in promoting the suc
cess of the University paper. It is,
obviously impossible to canvass the
University and personally ascertain i
the qualifications of every student
to till a vacant position. The oppor
tunity is extended to all, and unlike
the Congr.i-s, the Palo Alto dees
not debar ladies from its advantages.
