The R< vii u: of Ifrriei-s for January
contains an exhaustive article 011
the hi.-ton of university extension
work cf thi- country which has been
attracting so much attention of late.
The growth and practical ex cation
of this work has been phenomenal
during the last two years. The A''-
rh v: oj R> vims says of thi- work on
the Pacific slope:
"On the Pacific coast, California
lias not been been behind the other
states, and has used this system to
extend the influence and benefits of
its higher institutions. The Uni
versity of California announced an
extension coarse in the fall of 1891,
and during the winter courses on
history, literature, mathematics,
ethics, and poi'tical economy were
given in various parts of San Frau
ciico, while outside of the city
classes were organized in San Jose, !
Oakland, and Sm biego. The lec-'

tures chosen were on evolution by
President Jordan, of Leland Stan
ford, on astronomy, by Prof. Bar
nard of the Lick Observatory, and
on ethics, by Prof. Howison of the
State University. The courses
tended here a* everywhere else, di
rectly to the advantage of the uni
versity iu increasing the public in
terest in its work. A clear proof of
this was offered by the action of the
class following the lecture on
Shakespeare by Professor Charles
M. Gay ley of the University of Cal
ifornia, which generously contiib
uted to ths university for the
purchase of books on the subject.
