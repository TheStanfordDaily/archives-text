# New Buildings.
## 
### 
Despite the bad weather which
has lasted for over a month, work
upon the new power house and
foundry has beeu pushed steadily
and both are now rapidly nearing
completion. Both buildings are of
bricl: and although less beautiful
than the massive stone structures
which form our quadrangle, are as
durable and even safer in case of
; fire.
The J ower house i- 1(>0 feet long
by 75 feet wide, and is 17 feet high
in the clear. It is coverrd by a
trussed roof which is boarded,
tinned, and covered with a coat of
red paint. The interior of the build
ing will be one large room, in which
three engines will be placed that will
supply all the power for the Univer
sity. Foundations have been placed
in for these engines, two dynamos,
and also a line of shafting. The two
engines now used will be transferred
to this building, which will afford
more room in the wood-working
I shop and boiler room.

The foundry is somewhat larger
than the powerhouse, its dimensions
being 40 by 200 feet and 7 feet in
the clear. This building has also
a trussed roof, but it is covered
with corrugated iron instead of tin.
The building is well lighted, having
several skylights besides many side
windows. The interior of the build
ing will be divided into three sec
ions. The west section will 1,0
used fora foundry, the middle one
fora blacksmith shop, and the etst
section of ihe 1 uildiug will probably
be used fora pipe cutting and gen
"eriil repair shop The blacksmith
shop will be furnished with 2">
forges, which are being cast in the
city. These forges were designed
by Instructor Buchanan and the mod
els made by the studeutf in the
workshop There will be plenty of
room in this section, and more
forges will be added as they are
needed. Classes will be formed im
mediately after the forges are put in
position.
