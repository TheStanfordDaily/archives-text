The modern shoe is a growth. You
are so ac ustomed to its absolute perfec
tions that you are rarely apt, 'o think of
them if indeed you think of them at all.
The modern shoe is as far ahead of the
foot protectors of centuries ago as Maud
S. is in speed ahead of the tortoise. It
has kept pace with the progress of things
so that in every of the word the
modern shoe is worthy of the modern
foot. Costing no more than a shoe of
ordinary quality and yet ns faultless as
faultlessness itself.
