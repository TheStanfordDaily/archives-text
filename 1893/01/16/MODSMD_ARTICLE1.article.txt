Quinn of Mayfleld, who was the
lowest of live bidder?, some of whom
had prices as high as $511. We

much experience in this line of work

very neat building, which will be G5

the eaves, and with two dressing
rooms. There will be a gang plank
30 feet by S feet leading to a float
20 feet by 10 feet, these being
hinged and thus no difficulty will be
experienced as to the li e and fall
of water
