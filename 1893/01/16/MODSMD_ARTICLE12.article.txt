Some one has suggested that the
of the Pacific slope have a
uniform cap with their respective
colors as a distinctive mark. The
idea is a good one, and if canied
out would make it easy for any stud
ent to know another, and also to
know the college from which he
comes. It would add a pictur
esque feature, as well as lend anima
tion to tbe annual game.
