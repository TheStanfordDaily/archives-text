We are much pleased to announce
that the success of the Stanford
Boat Club is assured. For some
time it was doubtful as to what
shape matters would lake, but since
last Friday evening's meeting nil
l'eel satisfied that such an organiza
tion has been perfected and such
steps taken as to guarantee success.
The meeting was well attended and
great interest was manifested. Per
manent officers whose names appear
elsewhere were elected and they are
men who will move whatever they
undertake. The Philadelphia firm
that is constructing aluminum shells
for Cornell and H 11 vaul which are
guaranteed to be tin seconds faster
than anything of the kind hereto
fore made, may gt tan order from
the St infjrd club. For the finan
cial backing there are alout one
hundred members and many more
soon to be added a committee has
betn appointed to canvas 3 the stu
dent body and faculty. Sixty-five,

of whom thirty-seven were l-adies,
became members at the last meeting.
A benefit concert will be given
next month by the Male Quartette,
the Band, anil other ljcal ta'ent.
Another entertainment will prob
ably be given about Easter. If a
creditable record can be made in
time for the World's Fair, the
management are heartily in favor of
having the crew represented. Every
one knows that nothing will give
the University a better advertise,
ment thnn a step of this kind. As
to the pleasures cf boating little
need be Slid, for those who have eu
joyed it are the most enthusiastic.
Let all become members cf the or
ganization and boom the enterprise
for all it is worth.
