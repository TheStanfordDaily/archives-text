Mrs. Skelton, of the San Francisco
Women's Christian Temperance Un
ion, delivered an address in the
Chapel Saturday evening on "The
Dark Side of San l'rancisco." Mrs.
Skelton has been an earnest laborer
in Christian woik in San Francisco
during the past eleven years, and
has been brought in personal con- ;
tact with much of the dark side of
that city.
The s] eaker dwelt particularly on
the existence of five thousand li
censed sa'oons in a city of only
three hundred thousand people, »nd|

the powerful influence of the suloou
and its allies in the government of
the city. Probably in no other large
city is the proportion of saloons to
population . k o great as here.
The work of the W.C T. ' in try
ing to counteract and lessen the ef
fect of the saloon was explained,
and the influence of the great good
of individual effort was shown in
numerous cases.
Owing to the late hour at which
the notice of the addr.B3 was posted
on the bulletin board, a very small
audience was present.
