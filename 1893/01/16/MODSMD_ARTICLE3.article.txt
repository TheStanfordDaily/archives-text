game, such a mistake or deception
should bs carefully avoided in* the
future The game having been ad
vertised to be played by the Stan
ford team, the attendance was laige
and the profits proportionate.
These profits amounting to about
$'2uO were divided among the
players. Each man who received
such money and kept it, is, accord

any University team or contest in
any amateur sport. It is reported
that some of the men have turned
