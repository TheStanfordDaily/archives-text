Iter. Thomas Van Ness, a Unitar
ian minister of San Francisco, deliv
ered the sermon. liis subject was
the "Modern Trend of Industrial
iam toward the Kingdom of God."
As one would judge fiorn the sub
ject chosen as a text, much was
discussed which had n direct bear
ing upon social science and econom
ics. He said the tendency of the
times was toward pessimism, and
that many found it difficult to recon
c lethe preachiug of to-day with the
actual business world. That even
among religious people there was
not as much faith as in former times
and that this should not be, for if
God were all powerful in 1893 B. C.
he should certainly be in ISD3 A. D.
He then showed how the people
were mistaken and that the indus
trial working of the age was the op
site of what many think. Statistics
were presented to prove the wondei
ful growth of industrialism and its
great influence in the nineteenth
century. "We should not deny agi
tation and discussion, for only by the
interplay of forces which are almost
opposite is the progress brought
about. Revitalizxtion is often the
result of imagination which is in
duced frequently by unharmonious
surroundings; thus the old station
ariness is broken up and greater ad
vancement is made. Modern indus
trialism is disciplining the masses
in regularity, honesty, politeness,
sobriety, and gentleness. One na
tion no longer may expect to pros
per at the expense of the other.
Evolution is turning evil to a mighty
good and eventually the meek shall
inherit the earth. God still
his people and the duty of the joung
who hope for happiness is to put
themselves into harmony with the
movement of the ages.
