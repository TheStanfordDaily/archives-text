# EDITORS RECEIVE CREDIT
## A
						New Interest Taken in the College Papers. Under Certain Conditions Credit will be Given in the English Department. 
### 
It is very difficult to lincl persons
that are able, interested, add willing
to devote their time and services to,
the college papers. In such a uni
versity us ours, there should be no
lack of candidates eager and capable
for s,uch positions. No one can dis
pute the value of such training;
and the time taken up by such du
ties, if rightly used, amounts to
but little. There is always room on
the papers for the right kind of per
sons, and no one should be back- j
ward in making his wants known if
he desires such a position. It is
very gratifying that the English de
paituient is interested in the work of
the college papers, and is offeringj
such inducements as it does. In the
following communication is a state
ment that the editors will receive
credit under certain conditions:
L;land Stanford Junior University, j
Palo Alto, Jan. 10, lSl'3
To the Editors of the Palo Alto:
Gentlemen: Your editorial of the
thirteenth, urging that credit toward
the degree ought to be given for
work dor.e on a college paper, ap
peared while the English depart
ment was endeavoring to devise an
equitable plan for granting the credit
of which you speak. We think the
following terms fait :
To receive credit, students must
have passed in English I. They
must enroll themselves in English
VIII., and fulfil all the require
ments of the course. The number of
hours they are taking will be subject
to the general rule forbidding more
than eighteen hours to be taken
without special permission. Contri
butions to any paper will be ac
cepted, either before oÂ» after publi
cation, as a part of the regular work
of the course, the credit for any con
tribution being determined by the
instructor. Contributions for which
credit is desired may be handed in
either in print or in manuscript, and
if necessary, they may go beyond
the usual limit of length: in other
respects they will be treated like the
rest of the written work in the course
There are two sections iu English
VIII.; one at half past eight Monday
and Wednesday in room 10, the
other at half past eleven Tuesday j

aud Thursday in room 20. Students
who wish to avail themselves of the
opportunity here offered, but who
can come at neither of these hours,
will plea-e confer with me.
The English department is as
eager as the editors of the Palo
Alto can be that the college papers
should not only be a means of dis
cipline in composition, but should
represent fully and fairly the public
opinion and the literary ability of
the University. Too often the best
writers in a college hang back, and
thus the college paper represents
not the best, but the second best.
Every student who sees an evil,
who wishes to make a suggestion,
or who conceives an opinion which
maybe worth bringing before the
college world, should let the editors
of the Palo Alto determine whether
or no it is; and every student who
thinks or whose fiieuds think he
l - as written a tolerable story, a fair
piece of verse, or a clever essay,
should send it to the Sequoia. Men
ought to "come out" as readily aud
loyally for the paper as for the
eleven. Yours very truly,
Henry B Lathrcp.
