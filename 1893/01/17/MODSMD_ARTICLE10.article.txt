# A 						FALSE RUMOR
## Bold Assertions Made Without Any Foundation. Our Football Management Knows Nothing of the Arrangements. 
### 
Again a long suffering public i< to
Lave another foothill game inflicted
on tLeii wearied gaze and exhausted
pocketbook. It teems that some
one not sa'i-fied with a legitimate
amount of the great sport, has taken
upon himself, doubtles- for peeuni
aiy gain, to work up a game that in
the md must only do injury to the
interests oi the annual intercollegi
ate games. If such a game as the ar
ticle below indicates is to take
place, the Stanford management
knows nothing cf the matter. Ob'
viously it can be nothing more than
some advertising "fake" some shrewd
parties are trying to palm off 011 the
public. The following is a clipping
taken from this morning's Examiner:
On February 22d ("Washington's
Birthday) there will l.e a great game
of football at the Ilaight street
grounds, the oppo.-ing teams being
the Olympics and the Stanfords.
The proceeds of the game will be
distributed among various charitable
institutions, and heads ot institu
tions desiring further information on
this point are requested to call upon
Harold Phillips, 11 Montgomery
street, who is in charge of the busi
ness portion of the game
Special arrangements have been
made with the railroad to run two
football trains, one from Stanford
University direct, and one from San
■lose The Berkeley students who
are to attend the game will have a
splendid steamer and two brass
bands. There will also be- a special
steamer from Stockton.
The Stanford's big horn will bo in
evidence on the occasion. It is 50
feet in length and 12 feet G inches in
tliL' flange, and the sound-producing
powi r will be produced by a thirty
two horse-power boiler. The Berke
ley boys will sport a horn of the
same dimensions, and there will be
three smaller horns of 30, 20, and 15
feet length.
The parade, which will be a big
feature of the day's proceedings, will
include seventeen tally-ho coaches,
accompanied by three brass bands.
One section of the pageant will con
sist of 100 Stanford boys mounted
upon !ts*-es, and dressed entirely in
the 1 jlors of the University. Thirty
of the co-eds, dressed in pure white,
will ride in a hay wagon. The pa
rade wi'l form 011 Van Ness avenue,
with the right resting on Bush street.
The line ot march will be Bush,
Kearney, Market, Goldeu Gate ave
nue, and out to the grounds
