A hint to the wise is sufficient.
Jt is reported that tbe University
of California has been looking over
tbe field of preparatory schools, and
bas alread}' laid eyes on some quite
suitable material for next year's
football team. It is also reported
that some of tbese men are pledged
to attend Berkeley and that the}*
have b:en given trial positions on
tbe team. We do not vouch for
these reports, but there is, at any
rate, ioom in them for some slight
moral.

It is gratifying to note, in the face I
of tbe rather scant justice done our
University by most of the papers of
San Francisco, that our students
are themselves a most excellent ad
vertising medium. We have few
croakers among us Everyone is
willing and anxious to say a good
word now and then in tbe interest
of our institution. Students wil un
doubtedly come here without this
advertising, but what, better testi
mony to tbe prosperity of any uni
versity than tbe freely-given praise
of its students. Many eulogistic ef-1
fusions and unwarranted attacks |
have emanated from without tbe
University walls but we are glad |
that witbin comes tbe calm, thougt-1
ful conclusion that it is good to be
here

It it true that, as a university, we
are young yet and have but few
alumni; ami yet »ve feel it would be a
pleasant and profitable thin# to ar
range for some kind of a Stanford
University headquarters at Chicago
during the World's Fair. It is not
a matter of so much importance as
to whether a building be secured, a
suite of rooms, or merely a register
left in some hotel which may be
considered as a sort of a center
towards which students from liere
may gravitate during their sojourn in
Chicago. It is a matter of consider
able importance that something be
done to bring the matter up in tavg
gible shape beiore the mass of our
students. We think the register
idta a very good one, and urge that
feveral plans be reported at our next
Aa-iociated Studentß meeting and the
lubject carefully canvassed

While we are on plans we desire
to revert to a hobby. It is in rela
tion to a department in journalism.
We earnestly hope that plans are be
ing evolved in the minds of the Uni
versity autboiities for the addition
to our number of courses of this
most needed branch.

here last year testified to this great
need and Cornell University has;
done a splendid thing in establish
