# No Congress Saturday.

Owing- to the lack of a quorum last
Saturday evening the usual meeting
of Congress did not take place.
Much discussion arose among the
members present ns to the Lot

sessions. Arousing meeting is ex
pected next Saturday and a full at

beneficial is this training that every
one ought to appreciate our Con
gress and make some sacrifices to be
present at its session*.
