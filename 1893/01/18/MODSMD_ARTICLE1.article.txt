## The
						Recent Contest of Interest throughout the Country. Our Playing and Our Players Compare Favorably with the Best Eastern Teams.

Casper \V. Whitney has the fol
lowing lo say iu Ilavprr's lletkly for
this week:
Although rather late to comment
011 football, tLe great progress of
the game in the west makes the re
cent match at San Francisco between
the Stanford and Berkeley universi
ties a matter of interest throughout
the country even at this late date.
We of the east are apt to imagine a
game in California as being rather
crude, and the spectators no more
tlun would comfortably fill a bek
lot. It will surprise most readers,
therefore, when it is said that this
Stanford-Berkeley game would have
been creditable to most of our east
ern teams.
The spectators numbered about
15,000, and were a typical football
gathering, made up, as we see at our
great games here, of the best people.
And they witnessed a struggle
worthy their attention. The style
of play of the two teams was essen
tially dissimilar, but each showed
exceptional skill along its own lines.
The play of the Stanford team was
more varied, and depended almost
entirely upon assaulting the enemy's
line at unexpected pointsâ€”double
passing and long end runs. Berk
eley, 011 the other hand, made their
gains by short but repeated plunges
into the light r line of their antag
onists, and forcing I hem slowly but
steadily backward until the goal
line was reached. Neither team
understood the use of a punt as a
measure of defense or ofl'cnse. The
Stanford men outclassed the Berk
eley team throughout the first half,
bur. in the second half the superior
strength of the latter team was made
manifest
The game resulted in a tie, each
side securing two touch-downs and
converting but one of the two into
a goal. Taylor's kicks were very
difficult ones, as boi.li were made
from punt-outs from well over
toward the corner, but Kennedy of
the tftanfords had both his touch
downs directly behind the goal, and
ihould easily have made both
Henry and Hunt of the Berkeleya
are men who deserve especial com
ment, the former being an end of re
markable sprinting ability, and the
latter a line-bucking half of well
ov c r ISO pounds, who strikes hard
every time, and can repeat as often
as called upon. Iu the liDe Foulks
was the best of the Berkeleys, al
though their heavy centre three
swept their men well back.
Clemans and Walton, the two
half backs of Stanford, did the
double pass cleverly, and the former
is the strongest running half on the
coast to-day for general work. He

has a peculiar way of tossing tlie
would-be tackier with bis bead, ex
actly as a bull would use bis horns,
and although being rather slight,
and weighing only 155 pounds, bis
neck seems made of steel
The stamp of the two Yale coach
ers was plain upon both teams, for
there were the spring and dash (all
the more noticeable, perhaps, be
cause some of the individual work
was crude), and the power to brace,
which have become traditional at
New llaven. That the match has
given football a wonderful start
upon the coast is certain, and it will
not be long before we .-hall see some
interchange of courtesies between
the Atlantic and Pacific in football.
