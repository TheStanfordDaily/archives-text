Now is tbe time to put our cinder
tracks in order. The ground i i soft
Tbe weather is perfect. Tbe sight
of the green fields and hillsides in
spires a feeling of friskiness in even
the most sedate. We repeat, now is
the time to put our cinder tracks in
order; for this is the time for cm
athletes to train.
This subject has been agitated
many times. Appeals have been
made to tbe wrong persons and in an
indirect and unsystematic way to
Senator Stanford to fix the tracks,
for we had not the necessary money.
They have all of coiw-e resulted in
failure, and the oval track with its
220 yards tangent has lain on the
campus like a great flgcre nine out
lined in a thin coating of cinders—
unfit for use, for it was never made
light in the first place, but still a
source of hope and fond belief that
sometime, may be with the comple
tion of the outer quadrangle, the
cinder path would be. We have it
in our power to destroy the source
of these beliefs aud hopes by fixing
tbe track at once. But should we
do it? We have hoped tor so long
that it might be bard to give up the
idea and to accustom ourselves to
' old number nine" dotted with
enthusiastic athletes training on a
first-class track.
We have about $1200 in the ath
letic treasury, our net proceeds
from football games after paying ex
penses. Bygone?, it seems, must
be bygones, so we canuot sigh hero
for the several thousand extra dol
lors we would have had if it had not
been for the shrewd knavery of
someone handling tickets at the
great game. Still we must not feel
poor. We have enough money to
fix our tracks. Then too there is
always tho piospcct of making
nnnoy from the annual footlull
match; and it i* not likely that th •
two gretfc universities of tho wot
v, ill allow such a gigantic sti al
of gate mou3y to occur again.
A rough estimate of the cost tf
tbe iuiproV'. wcnls is ■ igbt hundred
do ! b:v , four hundred d< ll.utt f< r •
cavating fora foundation of coivie
aud of crashed rock upo i which to
p io ilie cinders and fur puttii g on
the ciud'.'vs, and four huudsed d<;l

lars for the inside curbing which
must be of substantial material, pro
bably planting, about sixteen in
ches wide ly three inches thick ami
imbedded until only two or three in
ches remain above the surface of
the tract. All the material, the
rock, the cinders, etc., except the
planking, will be furnished by the
University; eo all we have to do is
to get the curbing and have the
work done. The very exact survey
ing required for the inside curbing
will cost us nothing, as has been
stated often. It seems that all there
is to do in order to have work be
gun immediately so that we can
have a track —and an accurate tract
on which records will be allowed—in
readiness, we hope, fora spring
field-day, is for the proper authoities
to tahe the matter in hand and have
the necessary funds appropriated
from the treasury.
No one can, fora moment, suc
cessfully deny the advantages that
will result from having a good tract,
or that the expenditure of even all
the money in the treasury for this
purpose would not be a wise act. A
good cinder track is the very nucleus
of all team athletics, for there a
man gets his lung power, heart
power, and speed developed, and
puts himself in good training.
