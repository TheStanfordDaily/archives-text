Prof. Von lloUt in an address at
the University ot' Chicago Convoca
tion on American Universities, says:
There is in the United States as
yet not a single university in the
sense attached to this word by
Europeans. All the American in
stitutions bearing this name are
either compounds of college and
university—tho univer.-itv as an ■
aftergrowth, figuring still to some ex
tent as a lcind of annex or excres
cence to the college, or hybrids of
college and university, or, finally,
a torso of a university. An institu
tion wholly detached from the
school work done by colleges and
containing all the four faculties or
ganically connecied to a univer.-itas j
iiteiarum does not exist.
Tire day when it could be
penously asserted that the United
States cannot afford to have such in-
is surely passed. A na
tion pajingin pensions a sum con
siderably higher than the cost of the
standiug armies sucking out the life j
blood of European nations not able
to maiutain universities—it is too
absurd to deserve refutation. The
other allegation inherited from the
past, that there is no need of such
institutions in this "plain demo-'
cratic" country, is deserving of still
severer rebuff.
I have not only visited but lived
in a number of countries, and there
suits of my observations of their
higher educated youth is that though
by no means as to knowledge, yet as
to the earnestness, steadiness, and
enthusi ism in the pursuit of knowl-,
edge the American students stand i
first. And nature has not been in a |
stingy mood when weighing out;
their allotment of brains! Give them
but the opportunities and you will 1
soon see whether they need to shun
comparison wfth the scholars of other
nations They are handicapped in a
way which makes the blood of a true
friend of this country tingle wish im
patience.
