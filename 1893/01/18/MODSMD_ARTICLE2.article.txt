# That Football Game at San Jose.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
A recent issue of your paper con
tained an article which tended to re
liect discredit on the persons who
played in the football game at San
Jose during the holidays. It is
much to be regretted that the writer
was not fully informed on the sub
ject. A short history of the affair
might not be out of place in your
columns.
It was originally desired to play
on December 2Gth, but the 1". M.
C.A. would not give us fair terms, and
the matter was dropped. Through
some misunderstanding, the San
Jose people commenced advertising
a game for Januaiy i2d, and the first
intimation of it received by us was
when a telegram arrived December
31st asking what train the team
would come on. A team was hastily
got together and assurance sent that
we would be on time.
But all this does not explain why
there was no surplus from the gate
receipts turned into the athletic fund.
This is only an apology for not run
ning up a high score and preventing
our opponents from scoring. The
gross proceeds of the game were not
nearly so large a- stated in the pre
vious article, and after deducting all
the expenses there was simply noth
ing left. Football expenses are
heavy, as Mr. Champlin will testify.
The expenses of some of the men
who played at San Jose were more
than twice the amount received, but
in order not. to encourage extrava
gance, all wore allowed the same
amount. Every one will surely rec
ognize the fairness of this, and cease
to look upon the affair as having the
least tinge of professionalism.
None of the players have returned
any of the money, and they will all
sturdily refuse to do so until the
arsity eleven make some move
toward refunding part of the money
spent for their expenses, which
amounted to over $100 per man.
