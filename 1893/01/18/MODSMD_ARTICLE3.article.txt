### 
Messrs. \V. AV. Price and S. C.
Lunt have just received their collect
ion of birds and mammals collected
during the holidays in the vicinity
of Ei I'aso, Texas, and Tuoson, Ari
zona. The collcction comprises
over 100 bird skins and 50 mammal
skins. Among the birds are two
species of cardinals, the Arizona
quail, several species of wrens, the
tiny Inca dove, (a bird no larger
than a sparrow,) and several thrushes
peculiar to the desert. The mam
mal collection includes a fine series
of kangaroo rats, desert chipmunks,
and three species of hares. The
Mexican hare, one of the species
collected, is the largest of all the
American hares and is found only
in Southern Arizona and Northern
Mexico. Skins of the black-tailed
fox and Arizona badger were also
secured. As the Zoological Mu
seum had no specimens from the
desert region of the southwest, this
new collection forms a valuable ad
dition.
