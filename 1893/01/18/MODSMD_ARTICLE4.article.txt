# The 						Isle of Guernsey.

### 
The regular Tuesday c-veniiig lect
ure was given by Prof. E. E. Smith,
head of the newly established de
partment of Horticulture, last even
ing in the chapel. He gave a very
entertaining and instructive descrip
tive discourse on that most interest
ing of small islands, 'Guernsey, in
the English Channel."
While on a tour of Europe Prof.
Smith spent several days on the
island studying the customs and
manners of the inhabitants and the
general affairs of the island. Speak
ing in comparison, Guernsey is the
most thickly populated district in
the world. The inhabitants have
the odd faculty of originating pecu
liar customs. "For miles," said
Prof. Smith, "oue can see nothing
but dwelling places painted green.
They seem to have a natural ten
dency for this color.''
Between the people of the Isle of
Guernsey and its nearest neighbors
there exists great enmity. Prof.
Smith gave several examples of this
feeling, which at times becomes even
ludicrous.
Aside from its, peculiar customs,
the island is best known to the pub
lic generally by the excellent breed
of cows it exports, which bear the

name of the island. Ou accouut of
this great exportation, and the con
sequent coming scarcity of the breed
in the island, there has recently
been passed a law prohibiting, in a
measure, such exportation. From
her soil Guernsey also supplies Lon
don with a very desirable paving
substance.
