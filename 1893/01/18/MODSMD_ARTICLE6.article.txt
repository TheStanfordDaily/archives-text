Owing to on oversight, yesterday's
paper was made to announce a meet
ing ol Congress for Saturday even
ing. It -will, of course, be held at
the usual time, i.e., Friday. This
gives us one more chance to urge a
good attendance Let our best stud
ents turn out, discuss the live issues
of the day, and keep abreast of the
times, while getting at the same
time goo<l parliamentary training.
We are but too liable as students
to get out of touch with the trend of
present events in the world about us.
We need the of live discus
sion to warm us up to a realization
of our responsibilities as educated
young men and young women.
