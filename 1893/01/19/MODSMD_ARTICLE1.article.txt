Much to the surprise and satisfac
tion of every one cornea the news
that we are to Lave a new track and
baseball field. The construction will
be under progress in a few days, and
before the next month is gone train
ing on these two fields will have be
gun in earnest. Mr. Shackelford
left this morning for San Francisco,
where he will visit the Olympic Club
to get pointers in regard to their
track, which is the best on the const.
He will also consult with the parties
who constructed this track.
This time it is intended to build a
track that will be of some value and
upon which records will be granted
without squabbling. The grounds
were staked out roughly yesterday
afternoon preparatory to an accurate
survey, which will be made immedi
ately. It was decided to excavate
abnit a foot of the earth on the
present track, tilling this in with six
inches of crushed rock and two
inches of cinders, the material being
furnished from the farm here. A
good hard-wood curbing is to be
placid both inside and outside of
the track, without which no records
would be allowed. A general mov
ing about of the other athletic fields
will take place both inside and out
side of the track. The new
baseball field is being placed between
Encina Hall and the new football
field- The o'd football field will
continue to bs used by the Ynrsity
team. The grand stand is to be
elected between the old football
field and the track, just back of the
present position of the back-stop.
Whether this will be constructed
this year was not stated.
All this activity in these matters
is encouraging to those interested in
track athletics aud baseball. With
the assurance of a first class track,
the prospect for track athletics in the
University should take on a brighter
hue. The captain of the athletic
team should be elected immediately,
and every man that has a ghost of a
chance on the cinder path be insisted
upon to come out.
