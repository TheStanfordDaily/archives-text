# The 						University Band.
## 
### 
Up to the present time this or
ganization has not received the sup
port or credit due such \ laudable
enterprise. Its members have been

practicing regularly tbrougli tie
winter months and have attained a
high degree of efficiency. The num
bers have been increased, instru
ments added, and thirty dollars
worth of first class music has been
bought by the players themselves.
The band now numbers twenty-five,
the instruments being distributed as
follows: 1 clarionet. 1 piccolo, G cor
nets, 4 altos, 1 french horn, 3 ten
ors, 3 trombones, 1 baritone, 2
tubas, 3 drums.
Two valuable additions have leen
made to the baud in the persons of
J. A. Miller, a skillful cornetist, and
O. C. Clayton, who will play the
French horn.
It is the intention of Mr. Kauf
man, the efficient leader, that free
conceits will be given in the Quad,
every Saturday evening. These
concerts wi 1 contain all tr.e latent
and catchy airs, and will be given
as soon as the evenings become
warmer. This enterprise is not a
money making scheme, and every
encouragement possible should be
extended to the boys to make a suc
cess of these concerts.
