# The 						Historical Seminary.

### 
The work of the semester in this
branch of the History department
was renewed yesterday. Two very
acceptable papers were listened to.
R. L. Gruwell reviewed in brief out
line arid with otitical comments the
work produced by Andrews of Bryn
Mauer on "The Old English Manor."
He was followed by W B. Moultou,
who traced at length the various
stages in the development and decay
of "Trial by Compurgation and Or
deal." This subject, naturally in
teresting, was made more so by the
presentation of a large amount of
detail. The work for the remainder
of the year will not consist of re
ports, but will be devoted either to a
critical reading of the early Lntin
charters, or to a critical study of the
municipal histosy of English cities
dating the Middle Ages, and will be
led bv Prof. Howard.
