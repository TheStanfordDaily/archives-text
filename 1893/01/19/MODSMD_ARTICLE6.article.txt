# "THAT GAME AT SAN JOSE."
## Some Other Facts Brought to Light. A 						Plain Statement from a Disinterested Studentâ€™s Standpoint. 
### 
Last night's article made an elab
orate defense of the San Joie affair,
but its flat assertion that ''after de
ducting all expenses there was sim
ply nothing' left" is backed up by no
evidence whatever. There is an
other side to the question, as many
of the students know. A team of
more or less inexperienced players
who happened to be on the campus
duiing the Christmas vacation played
a game in San Jose with the Y. M.
C. A. team of that city. Admission
was charged, and the share of the
Stanford team amounted to gome
thing like 6200. At any rate, each
of th? players received $12 as his
share of the spoils, and he kept it.
AVhen a man accepts money for his
athletic performances he becomes a
professional athlete.
The reader mny like to know what
the expenses were. After expenses
of advertising, paying for the
grounds, etc. were paid there was
still a surplus of about $140 on hand.
This was divided by the manager
among the players. By the way, the
manager spoken of here had no au
thority to act as such, as the ar
rangements for this game were un
authorized by the management.
As an example of the "expenses"
incurred, one of the p'avers s'.ated
that he had spent eight of his twelve
dollars to get his "sprained nose"
tixed. Another paid he had spent
$15 on a football suit, and the
money received did not cover ex
penses. The article contains "the
expenses of some of the men who
played at San Jose were more than
twice the amount received, but in
order not to encourage extravagence,
all were allowed the same amount."
This sounds well, but all the men
did not have to buy suits, shoes,
sweaters, and shin-guards. In fact,
nine of the players had their own
suits previous to going down Leav
ing aside theideabuying of suits, etc.,
where else would there be any ex
penses? Certainly was not
spent on railroad fare and meals.
All sorts of imaginary excuses
have been mentioned in connection
with the affair, but unless some
proper statement of expenses is
handed in to the regular football
manager, the adventurous little
band that went to San Jo?e at such

great expense will le considered as
professional players. If some of (bo
men's expenses exceeded $12, there
is no reason wh}, if everything is as
one of t'Liem claimed iu last night's
article, they should not be paid from
the athletic fund for what they were
out of pocket. Fairness .should bo
done by all means, atd these men
reinstated as amateurs.
