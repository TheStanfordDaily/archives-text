# THE
						UNAUTHORIZED GAME.
## Manager Clemans Receives a Telegram of a Peculiar Nature. The
						Stanford Management will have Nothing to Do with Phillips' Scheme. 
### 
The Kxamhirr appeared yesterday
morning with a full account of the
proceedings of tbe man Phillips in
connection with his proposed foot
ball game. It told how he had as
sumed entire control of matters and
without the consent of the Stanford
management was making elaborate
preparations fora gl'eat charity
game of football between the
Olympic Club and Stanford Univer
sity to be played on "Washington's
Birthday at Haight Street Park.
Phillips was pronounced either a
fraud or a crank In the face of
this article and his consequent know
ledge of the position in the matter
of the Stanford management, this
agitator had the audacity, or better
perhaps the lack of common sense
to send, last evening, the following
telegram to Captain Clemans:
"Will four hundred dollars be an iuduce
ment to fhy February 22i? (Signed)
Phillips."
Under these citcumstauces there
was only one course to be pursued.
For the management to accept this
proposition, even though the money
is greatly needed for geneial athlet
ics, would jeopardize our position
in the athletic world. Manager
Champlain and Captain Clemans
state that under no circumstances
will any action in the affair be taken.
The matter will simply be dropped.
