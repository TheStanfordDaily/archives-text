When the reduction in boaid was
made in the dormitories it was
Loped that a few inexpensive im
provements would be made in the
cuisine. However, no changes
have been noticed.
It is far from our intention to
continually lind fault. The case is
too serious for that. But we should
like to suggest that a remedy for all
difficulties could be found by en
trusting the management of the
dormitories to the students them
selves. Experiments at other in
stitutions have shown this to be a
practicable and cheap way for stu
dents to board. Memorial Hall at
Cambridge and the Yale Commons
at New Haven are existing examples'
of the success and practicability of
such a plan. So far as the know
ledge of the writer extends, the sys
tem practiced heve has never been
successful.
Good health and proficiency in
study depend largely on diet. It is i
as much a mistake to expect good
work to be done in a university
where the students are dieted like
laborers as it would be to expect an
Italian gardener to satisfy his ap
petite with iced civ am The trouble
lies not in any intentional disregard
of the students interests, but in a
failure to comprehend thÂ».' situation.
We rei e.it that we have no dispo
sition to complain, bit only desire
to register a plea for the students to
be allowed to minister to tl.eir own
wants, a< they sire fcucjejefuliy
