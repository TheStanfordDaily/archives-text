With all clue respect o the pio
lie r clas- or last year,
we ftie nevertheless qni'e anxious
that our i resen Seniors e e. t t'.em
f-c'ves to make the exercises o l ' Com-

mencement this rear more interest
ing. We are glad to know that the
claÂ«s at their meeting yesterday ap
pointed a committee to look into the
matter of class-day performances.
Those who aie so soon to 1-ave
their Alma Mater owe something of
this kind not only to the under
graduates and fiiends of the Uni
versity but to themselves. We take
it that after several years hard la
bor, it miut le the desire of even
graduate that the last week be an
occasion of no small moment to be
looked back upon with pleasure and
with pride. Since orations are not
expected from them", unless they iu
augurate class-day performances or
something of the like, the week will
be devoid of incident. To listen to
a lecture, to receive a diploma with
a how of acknowledgement, is
quite tame if no other events are
joined with it during the week.
Graduation' marks an epoch in a
man's career. Surely it should be
celebrated in a manner that will re
quire the use of some brains and wit
on his part. If the graduate dees
not think he owes this considera
tion to himself, he can see at least
that he owes it to friends interested
in him to wlom this event is of
prime importance. They will re
main over commencement week or
will come from a distance not
merely to see him acknowledge the
receipt of a diploma with a bow, but
to hear of and from him. Therefore
we feel that it is the duty of the
graduating clas? to arrange several
events for that week, so that each
individual member may take some
part in the commencement exercises.
At other places the year is ended
with a round of pleasant and inter
teresting events. Why not here?
