# Dr Elliott's Monograph.
## 
### 
The A(lw)\a< um, the leading crit
ical journal of the world, has this to
say of Dr. Elliott's monogram: "It
cont.ius, indeed, somewhat more
than its title describes, and might be
called a history of the rise of Ameri
can protection, for it begins with the
colonial period P the University
can produce a series of works of
equal merit, it will run the Johns
Hopkins Univers'ty close."
The Dm/, of Chicago, edi'ed by
Francis B. Browne, a!so has some
thing in regard to the same: '-The
young University on the Pacific]
slope has already borne literary!
fruit, and it is Dr. Elliott's 'Tariff
Controversy in the United Stale l ,
It is a piece of patient,
painstaking, scholarly work that
loDg needed doing. Broad-minded
men on bjth sides will welcome this
new aid in extinguishing the tariff
liar. It requires some continence to
bicome a colorless medium for other
men's thoughts â€”to report the battle
without taking sides; but Dr. Elliott
has kept throughout the objective
poiut of view. The book merits and
will no doubt enjoy a wide rending.''
