## The 						University will Pay for Everything but the Track Curbing.

As a result of Mr. Sbackleford's
visit to Sau Francisco yesterday lie
received orders from Mr. Charles
Lathrop, business manager of the
University, to fix up the new base
ball field and put the running track
in proper condition, provided the
students furnish the curbing of the
track. Mr. Shackleford says the
work on these fields will be begun in
a few days. This good news should
be a strong incentive to get all good
athletes out and hard at work. Mr.
Shackleford deserves the thanks of
the students for his kindness and en
