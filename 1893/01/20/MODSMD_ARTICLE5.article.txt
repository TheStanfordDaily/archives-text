# The
						Eastern Question.
## 
### 
The continuation of the work of
last semester in the History of the
Nineteenth Century under Professor
Mary Sheldon Barnes was finished
to-day with a final discussion of the
Eastern Question. H. D. Sheldon,
'OC, made a very creditable and in
teresting report on the Eastern
Question in Asia, the result of his
independent research 011 the subject.
For those who would review this
subject and have not the time for
extensive reading, the chapter on
India in Sir Henry Mayne's "Keign
of Queen Victoria" and the Eastern
Question in McCarthy's "History of
the Nineteenth Century" are valuable
sources.
