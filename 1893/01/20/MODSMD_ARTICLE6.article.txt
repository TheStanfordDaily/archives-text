This department has just received
from Mr. Williams, father of the late
Dr. J Francis Williams, the type
set of the igneous rocks of Arkansas,
described by Dr. Williams in the
"Annual Report of the Arkansas
Geological Survey, Vol. 11., 1590."
This set is very valuable and unique,
and could not be duplicated any
where. The rock specimens are ac
companied by their sections, which
will be used in instruction in petro
graphy. Dr. Williams was at one
time assistant on the Arkansas Geo
logical Survey; hence the rock col
lection was left to his old friend and
associate, Dr. J. C. Branner.
