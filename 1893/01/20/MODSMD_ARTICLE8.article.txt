# MAYFIELD Y. M. C. A. WORK.
## A
						Worthy Undertaking by Stanford Students. 
### 
Reading Rooms and Parlors to be Thrown
Open this Evening.
The Stanford Y. M. C. A. has
done a worthy thing in organizing
the branch at May field. This work
was begun by the appointment of a
committee on Mayfield work early
in October. The committee held
gospel meetings for young men on
Sunday afternoons and sent dele
gates to the Santa Clara County
Convention at San Jose, Oct. 25tli.
At this time the county work of the
Y. M. C. A.was organized and an
experienced General Secretary se
cured as County Secretary. Early
in December Mr. C. W. Janes, the
County Secretary, visited the Uni
versity and addressed the Y. M.
C. A. on Sunday afternoon, when
$7~> was pledged by the association
toward the amount needed to estab
lish a reading room and parlors in
Mayfield which should be kept open
evenings for all students and young
men of Mayfield and vicinity. The
people of Mayfield and the Univer
sity professors subsbribed generously
toward the support of the work, and
a building conveniently located
which was formerly a saloou has
beeti leased and fitted, up at consid
erable necessary cost for cleaning,
papering and painting, â€¢furniture,
carpets, etc. The rooms are both
comfortable and attractive and as
they are kept well warmed and
lighted they will doubtless be largely
used by the young men. The
Y. M. C. A. has also helped by ap
pointing a committee to assist in
selecting furniture, carpets, shades,
&tc , and it is rumored that the la
dies intend to give some financial
help also.
There would be some risk as to
permanency in organizing such a
: work, if it were not to be under the
! pupervision and direction of the
: Countv Secretary, who will help to
systematize and organize the com
mittee work so that the students
and May field young men together
cau carry it on successfully. It
will aho be looked after by the
I County Secretary as needed during
i the summer vacation.
The new rooms will be thrown
open fora general leception this
evening (Friday) when everybody
will be cordially welcomed- There
; will be a short musical program and
i a good social time. It is expected

that a good reception cf this kiud
will be held once a month for ladies
and gentlemen bctb, and it will
help not a little iu the social life of
the University. The Young Men's
Meeting at 3:SO Sunday afternoons
will be a special feature of the work,
and an effort will be made to have
good music and goo.l speakers every
Sunday.
