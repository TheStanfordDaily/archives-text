A bill Las been introduced by
State Senator Gasford providing for
an approbation of $250,000 to be
expended in building a branch to
the State University in San Fran
cisco. It is claimed that of the
1,000 students enrolled at the U. of
C., nearly one-half attend the de
partments located in the city. The
premises for these departments are
small, separate, and inadequate to
the present demands. Inasmuch as
the need is urgent and there is an
earnest support of the measure
throughout the state, since the ap
preciation asked for is not estimated
larger than the annual expenditure
of foreign students, the bill will iu
all probability be passed. If the
present plans are carried out the
building will be commodious as
well as beautiful. This fiction will
concentrate the four departments of
law, medicine, dentistry, and phar
macy. 'Every step of this kind
rmuks the progress of the western
people. It will tend to add to the
educational interest of California,
inertase the strength of Stanford's
rival, and thus quicken our activity
and development.
