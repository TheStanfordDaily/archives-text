# HISTORY OF PACIFICISLOPE
## First Time Such a Course Has Ever Been Offered. 
### 
Stanford to be a-Oeuter for Collection of
Historical Material.
To-day the course in the Histori
cal Development of the Pacific Slope
was begun with a largo class. For
the present year, as announced in
the register, the work will consist
largely in the collection and ar
rangement of materials, and study
of bibliography and sources, and
will be accompanied by a series of
lectures, giving a general view of
the subject with its larger connec
tion, during both the Spanish and
American periods. It is intended
to rurke this University the center
for the collection and compilation of
the history of this slope. Stanford
is peculiarly fitted for such work not
only on account of her location but
because a majoritv of her students
is drawn from all parts of this re
gion, and consequently better op
portunities are afforded them for
extensive individual research on
this subject than are afforded the
students of any other university.
The Sutro library with its old docu
ments in Latin and in Spanish]is also
a great advantage to such of our
history students as can read these
languages and wish to devote the
time required for research.
This is the first course on the his
tory of this interesting region that
has ever been offered by any uni
versity. Rut the University of Cal
ifornia probably will soon have, in
imitation of this idea, a course of a
similar, but of not so extensive a nat
ure, for at a meeting of the board of j
regents held last week a motion was
passed to offer Theodore If. Ilittel,
author of "History of California,"
$500 to deliver a course of lectuies.
on the history of California.
The interesting character of the
Stanford course can be imagined
from reading the list given below,
of topics for individual research out
side of regular class work. Some of
the topics have already been taken,
the names of the students appearing
after them. The result of such in
dividual research must be arranged
carefully and presented sometime
before the end of the semester to
