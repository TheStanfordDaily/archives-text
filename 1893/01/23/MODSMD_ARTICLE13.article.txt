# Roble Wants Mail Boxes.

### 
Editor Daily I'alo Alto:
The mail at Iloble is very ca;e
lessly banditd. Letters and papers
are simply cast on one of the lobby
tables where thtir owners search for
them among the mas 3. It is the
same way with letters for the mail;
they are laid on a table for the mail
man [to collect. The Daily Palo
Altos are read by others than those
who subscribe for them because
there are no boxes. Can not some
moie systematic way of handling
the mail be arranged? Roble.
