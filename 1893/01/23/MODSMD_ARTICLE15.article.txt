# The 						U. C. Will Have Another Paper.
## 
### 
The students of the State Uni
versity intend to issue a semi-weekly,
beginning next month. It will not
be a non-fraternitv paper, as the
Occident, their weekly magazine, has
always been by reason of its consti
tution, which prohibits fraternity
men from holding any business or
official connection with it. There
will be a corporation formed for the
new paper, which will be called the
Berkeleyun. One hundred and fifty
shares of stock will be offered for
sale, half to fraternity men and half
to non-fraternity men. Itisintended
to issue the new paper as a news
sheet once a week, probably Tues
days, and as a literary college jour
nal, probably on Friday mornings.
