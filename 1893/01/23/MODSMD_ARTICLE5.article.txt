Alpha met in the Chapel at 7:30
p.m. Saturday. Mr. Hughes dis
cussed the liquor question from a
prohibition standpoint. The regu
lar debate was" on the question
whether Irelaud should have home
rule. It was affirmed by Messrs
Timm and Marsh, and denied by
Messrs. Rose and Henderson. As
the debate had been well prepared
and the speakers were very enthusi
astic, it was a rare treat to hear the
arguments. Extempore speeches
were an addition to the usual pro
gram, and if continued will undoubt
edly be a valuable thing for the mem
bers. They were a3 follows: Mr.
Burvvell —"Why the Seniors should
have class-day exercises." Mr.
Hughes—-'Why Armour should not
furnish meat for the dormitories"
Mr. Rhodes—"Should the Society
have a critic?"
