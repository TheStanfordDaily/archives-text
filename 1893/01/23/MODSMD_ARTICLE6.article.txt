# An Impromptu Field-Day Suggested.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Much interest is being manifested
in baseball) and every effort possible
is being put forth by those interes:ed
in athletics to have that commend
able sport placed upon a firm basis
for the coming season. The entire
spiiit of the University was centered
upon football last semester, and the
results are manifest to every one.
Yet the athletic sphere this semester
must necessarily be more varied.
Baseball, boating, track athletics,
and tennis must all receive popular
patronage or sutler. Track athletics,
the very heart and core of university
sport, should not be neglected for
any of these. Work will be com
menced upon the track within ten
days, and many weeks will probably
elapse before its completion. A pre
liminary field-day should be held
some time during the coming week,
in order that our athletes may show
themselves before the o'.d track is
destroyed. An interest would by
this means be stirred up which would
cause men to come out and train
with an earnestness that would in
sure good records for our spring
