We have be/ircl it mentioned that
next Friday night will be university
night at the Mechanics' Fair in Sau
Francisco. The idea is to have all
the students who can, come from
both universities and vitit the great
pavilion at that time. We have
nothing definite to substantiate tbis
rumor, except a mention of the fact
in last Saturday's San Francisco
Chronicle, but the idea is certainly a
good one, and, as fjr the exhibit at
the fair this year, it is well worth
seeing; then, too, the great charity
football game, in which about a
dozen Stanford men will take part,
will be played in the city the next
afternoon.
