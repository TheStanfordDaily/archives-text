# ON THE BASEBALL FIELD
## The 						Men and the Positions for which They are Working, 
### 
Games will Soon be Scheduled with Out
side Teams.
Winter is now over in California,
and our athletic oval, only a few
weeks ago a miniature lake, is
thronged daily with men in uniform,
working hard to secure places on
the baseball team for the coming
season. Usually the cry is for more
men. Not so this year at Stanford.
Nearly all of last year's players
have returned, and with the excel
lent material furnished by the fresh
man class a dearth cf players need
not be feared. As is always the
case at the beginning of the season,
the outfielders are doing better
work than the infielders, because of
the condition of the grounds. The
men in the diamond, by hard prac
tice, are already playing remark
ably good ball, and are rapidly
acquiring that all-important factor
fora winning nine—team work.
The utter lack of team work was
indeed the only reason for such a
poor record as was made by our
team last year.
As Snowden and Adams have not
returned this year we have lost an
effective pitcher and a good third
•baseman. Walton, who was elected
captain last week, will do the catch
ing this year. He is a sensational
player, and will get the best work
out of his men. Capron, Campbell
and "Will McLaine aie the pitchers
and a'l have terrific speed and good
curves. No le c .s than seven men are
listed for first base and the filling
of that position is very doub'ful.
They are L. McLaine, C. Davey,
Ilussell, White, Newsom, Metcalf,
and Ilea. Davey has second base
pretty secure and is playing good
ball. Lewis is the only candidate
for shortstop and with his sure
ground work and strong arm is put
ting up a much better game than
that played by him at second base
last year. Hay and P. Downing are
the aspirants for third base but
neither are playing lively enough
ball There are very few candidates
for the outfield positions, Sheehan,
Harre'son and Pauley having it all
to themselves. They are all doing
excellent work, however. The
team is not batting in its old time
form, but with the daily practice iu
that line this fault will scon be
remedied. Mannger Grove is doing j
.all in Lis power to have the'

grounds put. in good condition.
Permission has not yet been given to
Lave a training table in the base
ment of Enciua Hall, but it is to be
Loptd that this necessity will be al
lowed the players in a short time.
A series of games will be arranged
with Berkeley and suriouuding
clubs as soon as the mc-n get in gocd
c ndition.
