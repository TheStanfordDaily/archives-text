In a r.re\ious number of the Palo
Alto the advisability of an orator
ical prize was suggested in order to
bring to life a spirit of ac'.ive
competition in the field of ora
tory and to give the most needed
side of university training a place of
importance aiuoug our students.
Wo now desire to uige the establish
ment of a chair of Elocution and
Oratory. DePauw University, Indi
ana, held first place in the Inter
state Oratorical Association fcr sev
eral years chiefly on account o l ' the
inspiring extrtions of a teacher at
the head of the department of Elo
cution and Oratory. Let the ener
gies of our students be directed in
this line, let prize or so be won
after some active competition, and
the .standing of oratory among
our students is assured.
