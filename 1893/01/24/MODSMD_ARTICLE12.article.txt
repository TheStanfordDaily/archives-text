Lvnr.v ui;e who i.-s inteiested in
public speaking aud the welfare of
ibe University, should cntbiuiast

times, ai d likely au inter-university
debite, and unless the best talent of
the University is represented, and
this talent well drilled by much
prac'.ice, those who witness such ex
eieises naturally will estimate our
ability as speakers below mediocrity.

taken unto itself new life, and judg
ing from the last met ting both in in
terest and ind eased attendance,
there wi 1 certainly be something
elone. Some of last year s good
woikers come out and take an active
part. A great many should devote
more time to this kkul of work. It
might be asked here very pr perly,

of any society under their manage

speaking. Why should there not be
a ladies' literary society organized?
There are certainly enough who are
truly interested in this tubjecfc, and
the carrying out of the idea sug
gested would add largely to the so
cial feature of the institution, which
no doubt could be bettered.
