# Who Can Play Football.

### 
At a session of the Intercollegiate
Football Association held in New
York on the evening of Jauuary 23J,
a resolution was passed to shut out
from the football teams of the
various colleges in the assoc : ation all
graduates, specials, and students not
properly registered. If an intercol
legiate assoc ; ation should be formed
this year between the U. C. and
Stanford, and the eastern regulations
adopted, many of both universities'
best players would be debarred.
