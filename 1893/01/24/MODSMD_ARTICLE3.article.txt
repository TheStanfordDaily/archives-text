# Senator Stanford's Views on Cooperation.
## 
### 
To all students who are interested
in the practical affairs of life, it will
be interesting to know the position
Senator Stanford holds on the co
operative plan. The fact that he
has introduced a bill to provide for
co-operation in the District of Co
lumbia tells very forcibly the side of
the fence he is on. In his speech
before the Senate he said that in a
large sense civilization itself rests
and advances on the great principles
of co-operation; that the weak by its
means are strengthened, and the one
in least capacity is brought up iu ad
vantages to the level of the best, and
the result brings all closer to the
entire fruits cf the united industries.
He thinks that with greater intelli
gence and better understanding of
its principles, the majority of the na
tion's industries will be thus carried
on. Co-operation will bring out the
highest capacities of those engaged
in it. The principle is a most dem
ocratic one, as it is the absolute pro
tection of the people against the pos
sible monopoly of the few, and thus
renders an offensive and burdensome
monopoly an impossibility.
I3y means of co-operation the
wants of the people can be better
supplied than by any other. The
moral influences are great, for all are
interested in each othei's welfare.
We hope to give at an early date the
Senator's view 3 on his land loan bill.
