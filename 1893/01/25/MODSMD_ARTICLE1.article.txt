# MARTIN KELLOGG ELECTED
## The State University has Secured a President at Last. Eight of the University Regents Vote For, and Five Against.
### 
Martin Kellogg, who has been
acting as president of the University
of California, was formally elected
by the regents. The final vote was
Bto 5. Regent 13artlett made the
nominating speech, and was sec
onded by Regent Martin. Several
regents made strong and warm
speeches in opposition to Kellogg on
the ground that there was needed an
infusion of new and young blood
into the university in order to give
it its proper standing. However,
the university now has a head, and
whatever opposing views maj be
held about the man, the simple fact
of securing a headship is a great
gain. Congratulations and best
wishes are in order.
Professor Kellogg was seen at his
residence last evening. He had
heard of the action of the regents in
directly, and was asked to give some
outline of his prospective policy.
"While I have heard ihe news,"
said the professor, "I have not re
ceived any official information or no
tification of the fact that I
elected to the presidency of the uni
versity, and, in view of this fact, 1
don't think it would be fair tor me to
make any announcement of what
will be done in the future."
"Have you any plans mapped out
for the future that you would care to
express?"
"I have no map. I have only
some general ideas as to what ought
to be accomplished, and the carry
ing out of these will depend on cir
cumstances. As I have just said,
however, I feel that in view of the
situation it would be indelicate for
me to make any definite assertions at
present. After consultation with
those in power I shall probably be in
a position to discuss matters more
fully, and I shall then be happy to
do so."
