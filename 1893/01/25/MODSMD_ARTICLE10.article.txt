The Palo Alto has attempted, by :
frequently naming and commenting
upon the wording of the various
seminalie?, to give them the impor-!
tant place in the university work
that they deserve. The theory of
co-operation is being thoroughly as
similated into the workings of our
vatious institutions, social, political,
educational, etc., and is accomplish
ing much at our various seats of
learning. Every student engaged
iu seminary work should feel a re
sponsibility resting upon his
shoulders. Jlis aid should be given
continuilly to assist the professor in i
chargc to inculcate in each indi
vidual mind the need of careful
thoughtful investigation and the
desire to present research and
thought-out opinions in a manner
that will leave an impression. Tate
in the one line of history and politi
cal science the work done by our
seminaries and try to estimate the!

goo l results. Is there not a per
ceptible growth in the matter of
careful estimation of our own state
and federal institutions on the part
of our young men and young women,
and is there not being given to them
better insight into the defects and
merits of the political and social
questions of the day? We think so,
and desire to add our mite in giving
all these various plans for individ
ual research and co-operative pre
sentation of results achieved in vari
ous lines a hearty support
