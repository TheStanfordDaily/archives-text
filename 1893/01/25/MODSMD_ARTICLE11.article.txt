Without desiring to clog the
minds of the readers of the Palo Alto
with continued suggestion concern
ing our needs as a university, we
nevertheless think it necessary that
some mention be made editorially
of those necessary things that go to
make our student life complete. At
the present time there is quite a link
missing in the fact that glee clubs
are notably absent. We thought
this enterprise of the student world
was fairly set going last year, and
were much chagrined when it failed
to materialize at tho beginning of
last semester.
While there dees not seem to be a
great abundance of available mateiial
here, we still feel that with the light
start we have enough good singers
to make a creditable showing. Let
the foundations, at least, be laid by
the students themselves, and we feel
that in time the University authori
ties will lend a hand and make it
possible to secure musical direction
without assistance from neighboring
cities.
