# Yale-Harvard Debate.
## 
### 
On all sides we Lave heard cries of
the decline of oratory. Instead of
the oratorical contests, so noted
throughout all the college circles,
we now have the more practical and
sensible form of public speaking—
the debate. This is the kind of talk
that counts for something in the

busy world, and we are gratified to
i see the 112. re most eastern colleges tak
ing the lead.
It was about a year ago that Har
vard and Yale met in joint debate in
Sander's Ti.eater, Cambridge. The
question then discussed was a po
litical one— Resolved, That a young
inau casting his first ballot in 1892
should vote the democratic ticket.
Yale had the affirmative. Governor
| Russell presided. In March another
i discussion took place at New Haven,
Chauncey Depew presiding. Each
side felt well satisfied with the re
sult, as the speaking wai excellent,
and no judges having been ap
pointed, each college claimed the
victory.
The question debated at Cam
bridge Wednesday night was —lie-
solved, That the power of railroad
corporations in the United States
| should be further limited by national
: legislation. Yale again took the af-
I Urinative. The judges were Prof.
Seliguian of Columbia College, Pres
ident Andrews of Brown University,
and Speaker Barrett of the Massa
chusetts House of Representatives.
| The speakers were Messrs. Cum
mings, Donnelly, and Lamson of
Yale; Messrs. Yroomau, Warren, and
Stone of Harvard. President Elliott
presided. Each speaker was given
fifteen minutes for his arguments.
The decision was given to Harvard.
After the debate an informal banquet
was tendered the Yale spankers by
the Harvard men.
It may be interesting to some to
know something of the Harvard
Union, the debating club under
whose auspices the recent contest
was held. It was formed in 1832 by
member jof the upper classes. After
a life of seven years, interest died
out, and from 1839 to ISSO the club's
existence was only' spasmodic. Since
1880 there has been much interest
manifested, and the membership has
been restricted to the best speakers
of the university. It now looks as if
the society would flourish for many
years. All acknowledge that it is
difficult to keep up interest in this
kind of work fora very long time in
large colleges. But the contest idea
is the one that keeps the matter
alive; in fact, about as much interest
is centered around this annual battle
of words as about athletic contests.
A student will work for his college
and the applause of his friends when
he will not work otherwise.
Ann Arbor has challenged the
L niversity of Wisconsin to a similar
test. Why should not the champion
of the west lock horns with Chi
cago, and later have an international
debate?
