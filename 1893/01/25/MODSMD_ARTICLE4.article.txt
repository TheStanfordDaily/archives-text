# IRISH POLITICS
## And Political Leaders. 
### 
Chas. Mills Gaylev, the head of the
English department at the Univer
sity of California and a graduate of
the University of Michigan, de
livered in the Chapel [last night his
lecture on "Irish Politics and
Political Leaders." Prof. Gay
ley is an Irishman by birth and
possesses all the irresistable humor
of his race, to which are added a
pleasing voice and a particularly at
tractive delivery.
He spoke of the origin of the de
sire in Ireland for home rule,
which it seems began not a few
years ago, but centuries before the
present time. But his discourse
proper was devoted more particu
larly to the campaign of 'SG,in which
he took part as one of the political
speakers.
In regard to the Irish question he
says that the Irish desire local self
government, such as is accorded to
Canada, the states of Germany, and
the states of the United States, and
that compliance on the part of the
British government with this desire
is the only remedy for Ireland.
But the opposition claim that if
such concessions are made to Ire
land she »vill next demand her inde
pendence.
The prime workers in the Irish

cause during that campaign were
spoken of and many humorous in
cidents were related in connec'iou
with them and with the high'y ex
citing times in an Irish campaign
Mr. Sexton, the greatest living
Irish orator and the orator of the
Irish cause, a man with a line fluent
style; Timothy Healey, the party
lawyer; "VVm. O'Brien, the party
editor, a man who was egged at his
speeches in Canada, loudly ap
plauded in the United States; and
finally imprisoned in England, and
the party vicar, Mr. O'llara—all
were young men about thirty-five
years of age. All the great Irish
leaders have been young men at the
time of their activity in the cause of
home rule.
But the greatest of the Iris?h
leaders was Charles Stewart
Parnell. He came from a family
long connected with British affairs
of state. In connection with Mr.
Parnell's downfall, Prof. Gayley
spoke in a sad and sympathetic
manner. For several years before
his fall Mr. Parnell was physically
and mentally weakened [and ill But
with the exception of that period he
was always an energetic, hard
worker for the Irish cause. He was
not an orator, but to this fact he
probably owed much of his power,
for he never lost his head in his de
liberate speeches nor forgot veracity
and logic as too many of the great
Irish orators did in the wild enthus
iasm.
Most of the jokes we have heard
before, but this may be because the
lecture was written seven years ago;
still they were so well and happily
told that they were always appre
ciated and never failed to call forth
hearty laughter and prolonged ap
plause from the large audience
