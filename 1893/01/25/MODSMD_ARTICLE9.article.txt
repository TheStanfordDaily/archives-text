Only by continual hammering at
a given subject can anything be ac
complished. We desire, therefore, !
to bring up ngain in a few brief j
lines the matter of social events.
Are we going to poke our heads out
of our crab like shell this year or
add another crust to the already ac
cumulating layers of indifference
that keep us selfishly distant from
each othei? Have we any social
duties to perform? Shall we not
have more class affairs? Can we not
have some inter-fraternity events? |
Ask yourself a number of questions |
along this line and then set to work ,
doing your part to inaugurate a j
change.
