Students Laving oratorical aspira
tions Lave tlnis far bad a thorny
patb to travel at Stanford. One
trouble with the Congress and other
similar orguniz itions seems to Lave
been the lack of a definite aim. As
an attempt at a solution of tLe dif
ficulty we srggest another oratorical
contest. With tlree or four prizes

iu sight we believe there would be
less trouble iu developing the latent
eloquence ceitainly existing among
seven hundred students. The mo
tive m.iy appear mercenary but there
is no surer means of inducing volun
tary effort than by the means of a
tangible reward. Dollars or gory
wi'l appeal to most of mankind, and
in this case the winner reaps both.
Whatever maybe said of the pes-;
ent tendency of the newspaper to,
usurp tbe place of the orator, the.
latter will always have his place in a
xepublic. The flaent speaker wields !
a power to be envied, and the talent
should be cultivated. If we ever
expect to compete with other institu
tions upon other than athletic ne'ds
we must expend our energies in |
the required directiun. The annual
oratorical contest should have as
large a place in the University Cal
endar as Class Day or Baccalaureate
Sermon. Too much time has already
been allowed to pass before starting
au oratorical association. We hope
a movement to tbat end will be made
at once.
