# Morning Prayers at Yale.
## 
### 
The question of abolishing com
pulsory attendance at morning pray
ers and chapel services on Sunday at
Yale is receiving considerable atten
tion of late at New Haven, The col
lege papers have taken the matter up
and are discussing it with a good
deal of interest. One of the city
papers has interviewed the more
prominent professors on this subject
and has published the results.
Perhaps the most significant inter
view was with Prof. Edward S. Dana,
who is regarded by many as standing
in the direct line of election to the
presidency of the university. In
the course of his conversation Prof.
Dana said:
'•The whole thing resolves itself
into the question as to whether Yale
is a college or a university. If it is
a college it may be a proper thing
to compel students to attendreligious
t xercises; but a university demands
a more liberal spirit. Yale's present
system, I am free to say, is not in
keeping with the university stand
ard. The Yale man's average age is
growing older year by year. I have
been instructing here about twenty
years, and the average age of the men
has grown two years in that time.
A more ideal university standard
than that we have now demands that
students should not be driven into
chapel like sheep."
The outcome of this discussion
will ba watched by Harvard men
with no little interest for obvious
reason —Brown Herald.
