## A 						Reply to an Anonymous Article in To-Day's "Sequoia."

Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
The communication which ap
pealed in to-day's Sequoia signed by
one who ha? the temerity to call
himself an "athlete," shows alack of
knowledge of even the general busi
ness of the football management.
The space in the Daily Palo Alto
is too limited to allow me to discuss
the business details with one who
writes over a nom de plume, but in
justice to myself I would like to
point out a few errors of which au
"athlete" is guilty. In the first
place the expenses of the team that
went south were not assured by the
Los Angeles Athletic Association.
Second: The Committee on Football
decided as to what our coach should
receive In regard to the subscrip
tion list, many who put down their
names for various sums declined to
pay when called upon.
In conclusion I would like to
*tnte that for all moneys which
passed through my hands 1 have an
itemized account. The other two
members of the footbnlll committee
have assured me that their report 011
the financial reuilt of the U. C .-
Stanford game would be ready by
the coming Saturday. 1 had no
thing to do with the finances of the
great game and therefore I could
not make a full report until the ac
counts were handed over to me.
