11. Melville Tenney entertained a
large crowd iu the Chapel last eveil
ing with a lecture on "Kings Ri\er
Canyon, and How We Climbed Mt.
Whitney." The lecture was illus
trated by eighty stereopticon views
of tlur principal scenes to be found
in so beautiful a country.
Mr. Tenney with a party spent a
month last summer exploring the
canyon of the South Fork of Kings
River, and took many photographs,
some of which have never been
shown before in public.
The lecture was introduced by a
large map showing the route of the
party and the chief points of interest
in the valley. Many of the views
were from photographs, but several
good pictures were shown that had
been sketched by one of the party.
He described this valley as being
"one of Nature's quiet places, where
are no bridges, hotels,or stage roads."
A trail extending through the valley
for about fifty miles is the only way
of access.
Several very fine views were shown
of the different peaks surrounding
the valley, especially the Grand
Sentinel and the North Dome. One
of the views pieaented was that of
an old-fashioned pistol, and Mr.
Tenny dwelt at considerable length
on the difficulty the party had in
trying to shoot a grouse with this
antiquated firearm. Mt. Whitney
does not, as many people suppose,
have a sheer rise of 14,000 feet but
in fact it rises from a plateau 13,000
feet above the valley. The last view
thrown upon the canvas was a
photograph shewing the cairu on
the highest pinnacle of Mt. Whit
ney with two Berkeley students
standing by it.
