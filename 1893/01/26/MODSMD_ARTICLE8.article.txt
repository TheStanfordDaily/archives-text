Last night's lecture on the famous
Kings River Canyon, which rivals
the great Yosemite in the grandeur
of its scenery, suggests the pleasure
and the information that a party of
Stanford students could derive from
a trip in the summer vacation to that
little knowu region. The fact that
not more tlnn a hundred persons
visit it. each year, because of its re

must be overcome to reach the val
ley, make the accomplishment of k the
trip one of more than ordinary in
terest.
