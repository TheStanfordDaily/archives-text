We suggest to those who wish to
keep ft record of college events dur
ing their careers here, the practica
bility of preserving the college pa
pers and having them bound. The
,s'rqttoiii makes a very preventable
volume when bound, as Volume 1.,
which is ia the library, attests. Two
volumes of the Daily Palo Alto
may be bound in one, and at a very
slight cost, too.
One often wishes to inform him
self on the events that took p'ac2
here ou some particular d iy last year,
may be, and then it is that a conven
ient volume of the college dai'y is of
service. Then it is valuable for the
pleasure to be got from it iu after
years.
