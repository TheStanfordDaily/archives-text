The doubt as to whether or not
Stanfoid would be able to have its
crew at Chicago to exhibit its colors
among of Harvard, Yale, Col
umbia, Oxford, Cambridge, Cornell,
and the other great universities of
the world, has faded away. It is
now decided that the zephyrs of
Lake Michigan will have the oppor
tunity of tossing the cardinal in its
play. This is made possible by the
generosity of those whose
names have become almost a syn
onym of generosity—Leland Stan
ford and his wife. The letter printed
elsewhere in this sheet was received
by Dr. Jordan this morning and
turned over to the Boat Club, who
immediately began to take steps to
ascertain the feasibility of accepting
the invitation to participate in the
regatta. Dr. Jordan was consulted
and he expressed his opinion that the
material in Stanford was as good as,
if not better than that found
elsewheie, and said that he
saw no reason except the
expense, why we should not
serd the crew. It was then decided
to lay the matter before Mr. Stan
ford and get his advice upon the
matter. Accordingly a committee
consisting of Messrs. W. T.
StuchelJ, J. F. Wilson and A. C.
Trumbo about 5 o'clock found
themselves at the Stanford resi
dence. Mrs. Stanford received
them and ushered them in to Mr.

Stanford. The letter was read to
biiu and the case present*d by Mr.
Stuchell He was very glad *o see
the enthusiastic spirit manifested by
the students in getting up the Boat
Club, appreciating tLe difficulty
under which they labored and
thought they deserved great credit.
He believed every university should
have such a branch of athletics.
He was then asked what he though t
of the matter of sending a crew to
Chicago. He was highly pleased
with the scheme but did not like
the idea of the boys being defeated,
which however would be no dis
honor in a crew so raw and labor
ing under such disadvantages. To
show his interest in these student
enterprises he said he would give
five hundred dollars. Mrs. Stan
ford then wished to know how much
it would require to purchase a shell.
She was told eight hundred dollars.
"All right," she said, "I will give
the other three." Mr. Stanford then
proceeded to give a practical demon
stration of the fact that he not only
kept up with the affairs of State and
of the educational affairs of the Uni
versity but was also alive to the ath
letic part, by giving the committee
sound and favorable points on train
ing for such an event as the coming.
These points were sucli as are ad
vanced by the best trainers in the
country, and will be observed when
the crew go into training.
Mr. Stanford, as all are aware, is
greatly interested in co-operation,
and has a bill in congress on the
subject, which we are glad to hear
was reported favorably. And in
laying this matter of obtaining a
shell and sending a crew to Chicago,
he was pleased to notice the club
had not asked others to raise the
money for their house and boats,
but had put their shoulders to the
wheel and had done it themselves,
hence his desire to assist. For he
likes to see people when they wish
assistance, go to work themselves,
and is pleased when he can show his
honest appreciation for work done.
The fact that the Boat Club has
given orders to have their house put
up, and have also ordered some
boats was appreciated by him, and
he was greatly pleased with this

spirit of push which was manifested
not only on this occasion but on all
occasions by the Btudents of Stan
j ford.
Having once endorsed t'.:e idea of
being represented at Chicago, he
! entered into it with his whole heart,
and began to suggest plans for over
coming the disadvantages under
which we will be placed, and sug
gest plans that would enable Stan
ford's crew to leave the last places
clear for the other crews.
The plan of the crew is to train
moderately until the University
closes for the summer, then resort to
! some place where we can have all
the advantages required, and train
until the latter part of July, then go
to Chicago. With this amount of
training and practice Stanford should
be able to put out a good crew.
This determining to have the cardi
na! flying at Chicago has more sig
nificance than at first appears. It
will be the greatest advertisement in
an athletic sense that this Univer
! sity could have in years. The whole
world will be represented there, and
for them to see a university in its
second year sending out a boat
crew will favorably impress them as
to the progressive spirit of Stanford,
and having it brought to their at
tention they will naturally make in
vestigation and when the people
begin to fairly investigate the meth
ods, etc. of the Universiy we can
rest assured that the membership
i will be rapidly increased.
"With this on a firm basis, the boai;
house to be completed in thirty
! d»ys and money enough to pay for
the shell, it is hoped every mem
ber will hand in his dues as soon as
possible. These dues may be
handed to the treasurer, G. H. Haz
zard, or to Messrs. Stuchell, Rose,
Searles, A. C. Trombo or J. F.
Wilson.
To Mr. Stuchell more than any
other one person belongs the credit
of energetically working to make
the Boat Club a success. By his
unceasing efforts ar.d agitation our
Boat Club has become a living real
ity and a branch of Stanford athlet
ics that will endure in the coming
yeais as a source of lively interest
and enthusiasm.

The following is the letter re
ceived by Pres. Jordan this morning:
Jan. 18, 1893.
David S. Jordan, Pies't Stanford
University, Palo Alto, Cal.
Dear Sir: Yours of Jan. 10th re
ceived, and I urge that you may put
a crew in training for our Internat
ional Regatta, to be held in Chicago
next season. There will be several
college crews that will enter in this
regatta that never before have rowed
in an "eight"—such is the condition
of the Chicago University, and Uni
versity of Wisconsin, who will
both enter an "eight-oar" crew; we
will endeavor to classify these races
in such a way as to make it as easy
as possible for your crew. There
will be days especially Bet aside for
the college races.
Please keep me posted. Hoping
that I may have an early and favor
able reply, I remain,
Very truly yours,
Dewitt C. Cregieij,
Commodore.
P.S.—Have just received a letter
from Commodore Hagerman of Cor
nell Navy, concerning the Cornell
•crew, that they would accept and
will take part in our International
Regatta next season. I expect to
hear from Oxford and Cambridge
daily. As for your crew not having
any experience in rowing in an
eight, do not let that prevent them
from coming, as we will have several
crews that will just be in the same
condition.
Yours,
D. E. G.
