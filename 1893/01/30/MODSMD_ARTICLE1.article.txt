# FOOTBALL AND CHARITY.
## The
						Picked Teams Failed to Arouse Much Enthusiasm at Haight Street Grounds. 
### 
Neither the Game Nor the Attend
ance Was What Was Anticipated,
The football game at the Haight
street grounds, San Francisco, last
Saturday was not the success it was
intended. Those who initiated the
idea of the game are not to be
blamed for lack of effort; they simply
did not understand that the interest
does not lie so much in the game as
in the teams playing There could
be 110 enthusiasm fora picked team
of players representing the army and
and a similar one representing the
univ=r : ity veterans. The majority
of the men on either side were good
players, but out of training and with
110 idea of team work The ground
was slippery and in places covered
with water.
The best feature of the game was
the tackling. Kennedy as full back
of the army team did some good
tackling and bucked the line with
some success. The fact that he
missed au easy goal detracted some
what from his duy's record. The
best gains were made by Clemans,
Harrelson, Porter, and Felt on. Tay
lor, Biiggs, Fvankenheimer, and the
two McLaines each played fair indi
vidual games. The line up was as
follows:
Army. University.
Dt Wilcox lefi end \V McLaine
P Downing left tackle Brewer

Flagler light guard Graham

fered seriou.ly with the wedges at
tempted. With small gains the b ill
changes sides. A bad p to 11 a v
relson loses the lull again. The
Universities' weakness in left tackle
was shown by the number of times
the Army broke through that point
and spoiled the plays. With a loss

Ft It on Taylor were put in p'ace
of Dr. M ilcox and P Downing.
This half was an improvement on
the first. The addition, of Felton

the Army team. His line buckiDg
gained ground for his side.

half that the Army scored. This
was due to Taylor's touch down.
