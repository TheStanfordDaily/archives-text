# Cornell's Aluminum Shell.
## 
### 
There is now being constructed at
Philadelphia, for Cornell, the fir?t
eight oared aluminum racing shell.
It is fo 1)9 finished by the latter
part of March, when the crew will
go to Philadelphia and try it on the
Schuylkill. The shell will be built I
entirely out of aluminum, except the }
wooden wash-bos and the outrisr
©
gers, which are of cold-drawn steel'
tubing, and will measure sixty-two j
feet in length, eight and three-'
fourths inches deep amidships, six
and one-half inches deep forward,
and five and one-half inches deep;
aft. The entire weight of the shell j
will be 175 pounds, which is from
twentv-tiva to fifty pounds lighter
than an ordinary paper or cedar
shell. A very light eight-oared
shell weighs 200 pounds, the more
usual weight being 225 pounds.
This shell will be built of two
pieces of aluminum one-twentieth
of nn inch thick, joined together
amidships, and is designed to carry
an average weight of 175 pounds a 1
man Ihiuiel J. Galvanaugh, the]
builder, claims that shell will be at !
least t-.n seconds faster than either'
a paper or a cedar one, and he has!
agreed that if it does not prove to I
fulfill his claims, we need not take
it.
Ours, however, will not be the!
first shell built of aluminum. Tie
builder first tried a single-scull for
Stratzell, commodore of the Schuyl
kill Navy, and it proved to be a!
strong boat, about four pounds'
lighter than any other of the same :
size.
Nor we will not have the only
eight-oared of this metal fora great
while. Harvard has ordered one
and Yale will probably follow her
example, and besides the.se larger
ones Galvanaugh has oiders for sev
eral single, double, and four-oared
shells.—Cornell Era.
