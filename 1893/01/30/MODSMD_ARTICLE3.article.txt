The Euphronian Literary Society
is to lie congratulated upon the suc
cess of its first regular meeting,
which was held Saturday evening.
Two interesting features of the pro
gram were an essay by B. O. Foster
and a book review by J. A. Gunn.
The question debated was, Resolved,
That the government should own
the railroads. It was discussed with
spirit and ability by L. J. Hinsdill
and Y. A. McGeorge for the affirma
tive and by A. M. Cathcart and B. X.
Bullock for the negative. That the
half hour allotted to irregular debate
was entirely consumed in an enthu
siastic general discussion forcibly
shows that the members are in
earnest, and augurs well for the so
ciety's future
