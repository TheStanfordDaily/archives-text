# Congress.

### 
Congress was rather slimly at
tended l:ist Friday evening, but
gieat interest was manifested by
those present. TLe clerk was in
structed to crop all old names from
the roll. Mr. Wigle presented a
bi'l for the prohibition of the liquor
traffic, which was referred to the
proper committee. This bill will
be dbcus-ed ntxt Fiiday evening
and as many as possible should
avail themselves of the opportunity
to speak on the subject, or at least
show enough interest to attend the
meeting, as nothing inspires a talker
mo.e than a well tilled house. The
discussion of the Gruwell immigra
tion bill took up most of the even
ing. Bishop, as chairman of the
committee on immigration, opened
the discussion in recommending its
passnge. Uurnell, Field, Giuwell

and Johnson made effective speeches
in favor of tLe measure, while
Messrs "Wuiren, H. W. Wigli, Gale
and G. G. Wigle stoutly opposed it.
TLe bill passed by a close vote
A business meeting of the mem
bers was held at which a report of
the committee appointed to make
arrangements fora debate with the
Alpha Society was read. T. R.
Warren ana R. L Gruwell were
elected to represent the Congress in
the coming debate, which will prob
ably take place Saturday evening,
February 25th, in the Chapel. One
more speaker is to be elected at the
next meeting. The subject of de
bate is to be mutually decided upon
by the participants. There is a
strong feeling against any decision
at all being given by judges as to
whether one side or the other scores
a victory.
