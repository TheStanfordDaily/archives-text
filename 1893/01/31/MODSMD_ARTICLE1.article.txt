# A 						SEASIDE LABORATORY
## Stanford Has One of the Four in the United States. Excellent Facilities for Extensive Research in Marine Biology at Pacific Grove. 
### 
This laboratory, a branch of the
biological work of our University,
has been located at Pacific Grove,
two miles west of Monterey, on a
low bluff immediately overlooking
the beach. The first session was
held last year. It was through the
generosity of the Pacific Improve
ment Company that the land was
furnished and a building erected;
and by the liberality of Mr. Tim
othy Hopkins that the building was
equipped and provision made for the
future continuation and extension of
the enterprise.
I he aims of the laboratory are,,
first, to supplement the work given in
the regular courses of instruction in
the zoological, botanical, and physi
ological departments; second, to
provide facilities for investigators
who are prepa*ed to make researches
in marine biology, for which the Pa
cific slope offers exceptional attrac
tions in that its field is very rich and
is as yet largely unworked. To show
that by these facilities the luboratory
is attracting great attention, two of
the most prominent biologists of the
east have already written to the man- <
agement to make sure of tables for
the next session.
The third aim is to afford an op
portunity to teachers who desire to
become acquainted with marine ani
mals and plants, and to learn the
practical methods of their study.
The building is a two story one,
00x20, the lower floor being divided
into two general laboratories, a store
room, and a library room. The
upper story has one general labora
tory and six private laborrtories for
special investigators. All the work
ing tables and general furniture are
first class. There are microscopes,
microtomes, imbedding apparatus,
and an abundant supply of new re
agents used in microscopical inves-j
tigation. In connection with the
laboratory are boats and such appa
ratus as is necessary for catching
marine animals; also a gasoline en
gine by means of which is furnished
an abundant supply of salt water for
the tank in which the aquatia is
kept. There is plenty of aquaria,
and each individual worker has a

â–  splendid opportunity to study, and
so do the higher class work in mor
phology
The great variety and accessibility
of material for investigation is not
surpassed by any biological labora
tory in the world. The first session
last summer was a complete success,
and the prospects for the second are
very bright, as much correspondence
has already been carried on Dr.
Gilbert and Dr. Jenkins will have
the work in charge, while President
Jordan will be present during apart
of the session and deliver a course of
lectures.
The openiug session last year be
gan June 27th, and continued ten
weeks. The graduate students were
Messrs. McFarland and Green, in
structors here in Physiology, Rev.
Thoburn of Mayfield, former pro
fessor of Biology at the University of
the Pacific, Miss 'Ellen Lowell, in
structor in Physical Training, Mr.
Bradley Davis, '02, Mr. F. Cramer,
former professor of Biology at Ap
pleton, "Wisconsin, Miss O. Boring,
special student in Zoology, Miss
Nancy "Woodward, graduate of Uni
versity of Indiana, The undergrad
uate students were Miss Florence
Hartley, Miss Cora Glidden, Miss
M. E. Martin, Mr. E. A. Markey,
and Mr. J. Van Denburgh. The
special students were Miss Wash
burn, professor of Physiology in the
Calfornia State Normal School at
San Jose, Miss Annette Richards,
teacher of Science in Grand Rapids
High School, Miss Pollock, teacher
in public schools, Salem, Oregon.
This laboratory, the fir.st on the
Pacific coast, completes the chain
around the world. The first science
academy was founded at Naples,
Italy, in 187*2 by Dr. Dohrn. It is
kept up by the German government.
The second was at Penikese island in
Buzz ird's bay, founded by Agassiz.
It was run three years, till Agassiz's
death The third was opened in
1883 at Anniequam, Mass, under
control of the Women's Educational
Association of Boston. It was kept
up five years aud then turned over
to the Marine Laboratory at Woods
holl, Miss. This is the leading lab
oratory in the United States, and is
under the control of Dr. C. O. Whit
man of University of Chicago. There
are two other laboratories of this
kind in the United States, one at
Cold Spring Harbor, 11. 1., estab-I
lished in 1890 under the Brooklyn
Scientific Society, and one in New
Jersey, established in 1801 under
the University of Pennsylvania.
loreign countries are represented
as follows iu biological laboratories: 1
England three, France three, India!

one, Japan two, Java one, Australia
one.
"With such escelleut facilities as
described, such able professors as
Jenkins, Gilbert, and Campbell at
the head, and the fiuancial backing
of Senator Stanford and Mr. Hop
kins, th 2 Seaside Laboratory at Pa
cific Grove, opened iu 1802, prom
ises to lead them all. It has onlv
been started, but its reputation will,
in a few years, be world wide.
