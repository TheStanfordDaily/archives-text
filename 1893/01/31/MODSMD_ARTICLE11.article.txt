One of the large cable railway
com jennies in San Francisco recently
issued an order and gave directions
to tlie conductors in its employ for
tbe correct pronunciation of the
names of tbe streets crossed by its
line. Sutter and Kearney streets are
tbe most notable examples of mis
pronounced names which this new
regulation will in a great measure
rectify. The first was named alter
Gen. Sutter, whose name was pro
nounced nnd should be pronouueed
"Sooter." Kearney street was
named after a general also. His
name should be pronounced
"Kamy."
We aie glad to see business
men take such an interest in preserv
ing tbe correct pronunciation of a
few cf California's distinctive and
characteristic names. It is to be re
gretted that their influence in such a
good cause cannot be extended to

tLe army of railrcad conductors and
railroad and steamship employees
throughout the State who mangle
tbe pronunciation of the names of
nearly tveiy town that the duties of
tLeir positions allow them to bawl
out for tbe misguidance of tbe gen
eral resident public and for tbe trav
eling strangers also.
How many times have we heard
tbe names of tbe score of stations
between here and Sin Francisco mis
pronounced simply because of tbe
ignorance or carelessness of the rail
road employees. Palo Alto is one
of their favorite?. To the new stud
ent who, on his first arrival from
some other state, hears the brake
man yell "Pay-low Ail-tow!" and
then hears some one remark, "Here
we are at 'Pallie Altie,' " it is rather
confusing. We should like to see
Stanford students at least pronounce
this name "Pah-lo Ahl-to" as it
should be pronounced. Good pro
nunciation with distinct articulation
of syllables is the mnik of a highly
educated person.
