Those who have charge of the
class rooms should pay particular a'-
tention to the ventilation of the cla s
rooms and the Chapel. During the
evening lectures and the Sunday ser
vices in the Chapel the air has often
become so oppressive that young
ladies have been compelled to leave
the room. The same can be said of
the class rooais. There are means
afforded for ventilation, aud they
should not be neglected. Many are
debarred the pleasure of attending
lectures which should be en joyed by
all, simply on this account. Too
often lectures are held in the Chapel
with every window closed .
