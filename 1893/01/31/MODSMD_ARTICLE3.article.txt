Considerable valuable material for
the Horticultural department has
lately been received from Europe.
Forty or fifty kinds of glace fruits
came from England, and a large col
lection of implements and products
from central and southern Spain.
The large field west of Roble Ilali
has been given up for an experimental
orchard temporarily. The real
ground set aside for horticultural
purposes is forty acres just north of
the reservoir near the quadrange.
To the east of this stretch of ground
and back of the shops the botanical
gardens will be placed. From all
appearances much attention will be
devoted to this work. The promi
nent position that California occu
pies as a horticultural stite makes
all these preparations necessary.
The scope of fhe work done in this
department will be second to none
in the country.
