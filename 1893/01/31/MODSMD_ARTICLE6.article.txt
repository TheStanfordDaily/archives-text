# A
						CAPTAIN FOR THE TRACK ATHLETIC TEAM.
## Last Year's First and Second Prize Winners Will Elect Him. 
### 
A majority of the men who won
tirst or second medals in the first au
nual field-day held last May, met in
the Eucina reception room last night
to discuss the election of captain of
the track athletic team. Art VI.,
Sec. 111. of the athletic
reads very loosely, or at least unsat
isfactorily, on the matter. It says:
"Its-hall be the duty of the sub
committee on track athletics to se
lect such candidates as they deem lit
to compete at thÂ« first meeting of the
yc-ar. These candidates shall elect a
captain of the tiack athletic team."
The committee on track athletics
was petitioned to select for the elec
tion of captain only those men who
had won either first or second med
als in the first annual field-day. Be
lieving that the last year's track
men should be given the same priv
ileges in the selection of captain as
have been accorded the football and
baseball men, the committee on
track athletics has ca'led a meeting
for Monday, Feb. Gth, at 7 o'clock
to be held in the Encina reception
room. The following men will be
eligible to vote for captain at this
meeting, having won first or second
medals: Tim in, Barnhisel. Maynard,
G. Calhoun, S. Calhoun, Crane,
Fernald, Bancroft, Sheehan, Lewis,
Pillsbury, and Stuart.
