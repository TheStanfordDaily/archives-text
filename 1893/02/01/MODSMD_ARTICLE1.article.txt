# LECTURE ON RAFINESQUE
## A Traveling Scientist Who Had a Keen Mind but Who Accomplished Little. Dr. Jordan Interests a Large Audience with a Sketch of the Eccentric Man's Character.
### 
The usual Tuesday evening lect
ure was given by Dr. Jordan on
Rafinesque. More than seventy
years ago Rafinesque crossed the
Ohio and entered Indiana. This re
markable figure, wrapped in his old
yellow coat whose pockets were
tilled with toads, st<>nes, and note
books, would have been called in
modern terms a tramp
Constance Rafinesque was born in
Constantinople October 22, 1873.
His father was a Franco-German
merchant of Marseilles, and his
mother was of Greek origin. Never
theless this remarkable man was
purely American. lie began his
travels when but one year old, and
he first began to enjoy life in Mar
seilles. He became a botanist and
later a zDologist. Being fond of
books of travel, it aroused in him a
desire for travel. He never attended
college, nor spent any time in the
study of dead languages.
At eleven he had an herbarium
He lead much alone, and at twelve
he published his first scientific paper.
At the breaking out of the French
Revolution his father sent all his
money out of France, and his two
eons to America. Constance went to
Philadelphia, where he became a mer
chant's clerk, devoting himself to
the of Botany; but in 1805 he
returned to Sicily, and spent ten
years in Italy. While in Sicily he
discovered the medicinal qualities of
squill. He made use of this discov
ery and carried on a large trade with
Russia and England, until his secret
was discovered by the Sicilians. He
was married during his stay in
Sicily.
He next turned his attention to
fishes, and we are indebted tu hiin
for much of our knowledge of the
Mediterranean. He was an impa
tient and restless man. All his work
is obscure, being mostly drawn from
memory. Finally, in fear of France
and disgusted with the Sicilians, he
returned to America in 1815, bring
ing all his collections.
Many of his manuscripts, remark
able for their beauty of penmanship
and crude drawings, are preserved
in the United States Museum. His

summer observations were written up
in winter.
He was six months nt sea when
coming to America; being ship
wrecked, he barely escaped with his
life, and he lo*t all his worldly pos
sessions. On account of his losses,
his wife soon after deserted him.
tie traveled on foot westward to Ind
iana, settling at New Ilarmony,
which was fora time the science cen
ter of America Soon after he be
came a professor at Lexington, Ky.,
but he was scorned'and driven away.
Audubon became interested in
him. In revenge for the destruction
of a violin which Rafinesque thought
lessly broke to pieces in attempting
to kill bats, Audubon showed him
drawings of supposed fishes near by.
Rafinesque wrote up full descrip
tions of them, which have caused
naturalists much trouble.
On his return to New York he pub
lished many treatises. He had a
keen mind, but no seuse of perspect
ive. He had some idea of the origin
of species. He thought that new
species and genera were derived
from existing forms. He became a
monomaniac upon the eubject of
new species. He depended too
much upon his memory. He treated
his fellow botanists with scorn. His
name and work fell into utter neg
ltct. Piesident Jordan and Prof.
Green of Berkeley have revised some
of his works.
Agassiz says he was a better man
than he -ppears. He counts but
little iu the scientific world because
his work lacked detail. He at
tempted work in every field. His
only portrait has been taken from a
gold medal, lie died alone at Phil
adelphia iu 1840, ana it is not known
where he lies A whole nation wept
fur Agassiz, for he loved all. Rafin
esque died as he had lived, alone
