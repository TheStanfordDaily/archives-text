Senator Froctor of Vermont will
probably introduce into the Senate
this bill: bill looking to the foun
dation of a great national university
in Washington. The bill is said to
be practical, and to have features
that will commend it to the support
of every congressman. The framer
is ex-Gjvernor John W. Jlayt, of I
Wyoming, an experienced educator,'
who represented the American uni- j
versifies at the university celebra
tions in the Old World, and who is
familiar with institutions of learn
ing on the continent. lie thinks!
that no one place in the world has so
many promising possibilities and
advantages as Washington, and that
a university established there has
the chance of parity, if not primacy, !
among American educational insti
tutions. The bill is unique in that j
it provides for the government issue
of 820,000,000 worth of bonds, bear
ing 5 per cent., these to be turned
over to the new institution, and the
81,000,000 thus provided yearly to
be a fund for getting the best profes
sors in the lar.d. In this way the
museums, the Smithsonian Institute,
and other national institutions can
be brought in relations with
the proposed university. â€”Harvard j
