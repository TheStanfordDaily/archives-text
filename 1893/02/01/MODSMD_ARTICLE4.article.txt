fortnightly themes to be longer and
more carefully prepared than the
others. During the second semester
the fortnightly themes will be writ
ten iu the form of chapters or parts
of a connected story or thesis of
some kind, which will run through
the whole semester. Subjects must
be chosen at the end of the first sem

Thft other classes mentioned will
take up the study and practice of
argumentative composition. Papers

two classes will not be started un
less there is a sufficient number of
students who desire to take the
courses offered. He requests that all
