Tll j 1 mi i P v 5. ti3 S .op e History
were entertained this morning by a
talk on the "Pacific Coast Indians."
Captain Harkina, Laving spent
many years ot his life as a soldier
on the plains, is able to judge the
native Indian as seen in hi 3 natural
abodes and narrate many incidents
of the life of a frontiersman in the
early days.
Tlia subject was introduced by
saying "that contrary to the general
belief, the Indians were not all of
one nation, but in reality were
sprung up from twenty or thirty dif
ferent nationalities." The dress of
the Indian was fantastic and some
times remarkable, for often it wns
the custom to distort their 'aces and
bodies and wear hideous masks.
The use of money was not under
stood among the Indians. The
Mexican dollars were hammered out
and used as ornaments for the head.
It was the custom among the
squaws and younger persons to
for their dead by inflicting
wounds upon themselves and other
self-tortures.
Mesmerism was undoubtedly
understood by some of the Indians,

for it has been often said that one of
them would exereise an undue in
fluence over the other and as a con
sequence many have been put to
death.
One of the chiefs had gone to a
large city and on his return told
his tribe what he had seen. They
did not believe the tale of having
one tepee built over another (or as
we would say one story over another)
but told the chief that the white
people must have deceived his eye 3
or in other words mesmerized him.
The Pueblo Indians were divided
into two tribes, the Zunl and Macos.
They lived in small valleys and
raised corn, figs, pumpkins, etc.
The houses were built terrace-like,
the roof of one being the porch of
the other.
All the Indians about Rio Grande
and northward used a sign language
very readily.
Captain Harkius also made some
mention of the habits of the
Apaches and Arapahoes and also
gaveaccount of the Nez Perce war.
