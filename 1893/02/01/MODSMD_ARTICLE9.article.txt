It is not tlie purpose of this edi
torial to be an advance sheet for the
Register or to act the more humble
part of a circulating adverti&ment.
True, we are very desirous of in
creasing our subscribtion list, and
earnestly hope to see several hun
dred new Stanfordites next year,
but all herein coutained is only to
express the general satisfaction felt
by the student body in regard to the
kind of work that is carried on here.
One who has a year or more
in any college that strenuously up
held and rigorously followed the
system of prescribed courses and
ca'.echetical methods, cannot help
but enjoy the freedom that is in the
Palo Alto air. The elective system
makes all the work more pleasant.
In making a choice of studies, the
student has a large list to select
from and is supposed to pursue that
line of work best suited to his nat
ural bias and probable future calling.
According to this understanding, the
professor reasonably expects a bet
ter grade of work than if much is
done under compulsion, as is the
case under the old time system. It
goes without saying that the student
who cau satisfy college authorities as
to his ability to earn a degree in four
years, has more than average talent,
or at least such qualities as are es
sential to success. It may also be
said that every student has a pre
ference for some kind of work. AVe
feel safe, then, in predicting that
Stanford graduates will be in great
demand, for by following their nat
ural bent they must be better pre
pared for future life than the student
who has vainly endeavored to be
broad and thus know a little of most
things but not nil of anything.
Specialization is the key to success,
and no institution has so strong a
current that leads to specialization
as we have here. In fact those who
enter here with no definite idea of
specializing are soon digging deep
into some favored subject. To the
elective system is intimately linked
the advanced step uf requiring re
ports. This stimulates originality
and the spirit of investigation. No
one cau become a scholar who does

not think fur himself and investi
gate the many possibilities cf the
constantly arising problems. Tfce
reporting syetem not only aids in
writing and thinking but forms such
scholarly habits that a large number
of monygraphs will appear in a few
years, as the result ol this tiaining.
The giving of oral reports and short
extemporaneous speeches —not elim
inating but supplementing the reg
ular literary and congressional work ;
—will develop a class of students
who can hold their own. And the
ability to impart is quite as essential
as to acquire. Another feat me of
our work of which we cmnot speak
too highly is the Seminary. In this
the professorial cbair is vacated, and
fora while the teacher and student
me.'t upon the common ground,
talking familiarly, both become
more interested in each other as
well as the subject discussed. Thus
genuine enthusiasm is kindled, which
will not die. Some one has said
that "enthusiasm is the element of
success in everything. It is the star
that leads on and up." In addition
to this excellent system is our
library, which up to the times and
managed efficiently, affords each one
a rare opportunity. Few colleges,
if any, get more benefit from the
library than we. Our shelves are not
loaded with dead volumes wbich
someone has given away because
tired of seeing them around. The
books are valuable and up to date.
Certainly with the advantages this
institstion offers, education, in its
exact sense, and development will
be attained by every true student.
