"Week,
By the 20th iust. the long desired
boat house now under process of
construction on the south end of
the lake near the stock farm will be
completed. The contract was given
to Quinu, of Mayfield, about a
week ago, and this builder has
promised to have the house com
pleted by the above mentioned time.
It is to be f>s feet long by 20 feet
wide, thus affording ample accomo
dations for the shells and pleasure
boats of the club. Sis or eight of
these pleasure boats will be in readi
ness as soon as the house is com
pleted.
There will be two large cloak
rooms in the boat house, one for
ladies and one for gentlemen. The
house will extend some dislance
over the water, in order to facilitate
easy landing when the water is low.
Thirty feet from the outer end a
large float will be anchored. This
will be connected to the boat house
by a trussed gang plank.
Since Senator and Mrs. Stanford
contiibuted so generously to the suc
cess of the club, a great deal of in
teiest in boating has been mani
fested As the students generally
know, Stanford will most probably
be represented in the great boat race
next August at Chicago
Persons desiring to become mem
bers of tie club are requested to
hand iu their names to Mr. Searles,
secietary. Initiation fees of the
present members will be collected
this week. The sum is $2.50. All

as it is absolutely necessary that
enough money to pay for the boat
house aud pleasure boats be on hand
immediately. Membership fee will
soon be raised to $5.00.
A letter has been received this
â– week from a ptrson in San Francisco
who has a four-oared shell for sale.
