Tee Associated Students at Berk
eley recently voted A. G. Lang the
sum of one hundred and fifty dollars
as a testimony of their appreciation
of the services he had rendered them
Mr. Lang represented the Univer
sity of California in the business
management of the football game
At the same time W. S. Bran was
voluntarily voted the sum of fifty dol
lars for the work done as manager
of the team. We do not know how
those who had charge of the busi
ness management from Stanford feel
about the matter, but we think it
would be doing the nice thing to
have our students voluntarily offer
them a recompense for their labor,
which was certainly immense and
which caused them to loose much of
their valuable time. We do not
think the treasury at Berkeley is
any better provided with funds than
our own, if it is in as good condition.
