We hope there is already in exis
tence here a high sense of honor and
moral integiity which leads each
member of our student body to dis
countenance that habit of peculation
on a small scale which often exists in
our institutious of learning under
the name of "receiving aid in exam
inations." Nothing so amply dis
closes the healthy moral tone of an
institution ns uprightness in this
one particular and, nothing gives a
lower opinion of a university than
laxity in this one particular. It is
reported of one university where
tinal examinations are indulged in,
that so strong is the moral sentim; nt

against che .ting tLat the student at
tempting it becomes ostracized, so
much so tLat lie is forced to seek for
learning elsewhere Our examina
tions are not such awful tests; never
theless it is important that such
honor be observed during them on
the part of each student. In an
other column will be noticed some
regulations passed by the faculty of
Piinceton on this subject, in which
we find that etudents there are on
examination day are to be left alone
with their questions and their honor.
