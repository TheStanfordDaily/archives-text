## The
						Universities' Detective Submits His Report. Ticket-Takers at the Gates Were Dishonest. 
### 
Moulton and G-ruwell Submit Their
Itemized Report of the Game
Expenses, It is Approved.
The Board of Athletic Directors
held a special meeting last evening
to hear the financial reports of Gru
well and Moulton, of the football
committee, and of Football Manager
Champlin. Mr. Moulton also sub
mitted au extensive report on the
work done by the detective engaged
to investigate the alleged "crooked
ness" in the receipt aud sale of tick
ets at the late football game. As a
member of the football committee,
Mr. Moulton suggested that the en
tire management of the next inter
collegiate football game be placed in
the hands of the University Club of
San Francisco.
A vote of thanks was tendered the
law firm of Thomas, Gregory, &
Cbickeriug for their kindness in of
fering to defend gratuitously the in
terests of the two nniverfities in
their present litigation.
The detective reported that after
ten days of continuous work in in
vestigating the case he had come to
the following conclusions:
First. That the number of people
in attendance at the football game
was in excess of those legitimately
accounted for by about one thousand.
Second. That this excess of per
sons obtained admission to the
grounds by means of genuine tickets
of admission, sold to them by cer
tain persons, ticket scalpers, outside
the gates and box offices on the day
of the game
Third. That all of the tickets as
sold by the scalpers, except fifty sold
by "Nibsey" Levy, five s-old by J. I\.
Love, and twenty sold by «J. K.
Love's brother, were furnished to
them by some one of the gate-keep
ers after thtjy lmd bueu taken in at
the gate for admission, and before
they had been deposited in the box
provided for that purpose.
Fourth. That the tickets were not
furnished to the scalpers from the
box oifice.
Fifth. That there is no indication
that tickets were furnished these
scalpers by any of the students.
Sixth. The interview| I have had
with Love aud Clifford, their man
ner, their dUp»ition to mak* a full

ami free statement, aud the fact of
their consulting with and taking the
advice of an attorney in regard to
the matter, convinces me that they
know more about how the tickets
were obtained and sold by the scalp
ers than any one else, and that in all
probability they were the men
through whom the whole matter was
conducted.

The original price asked for the
grounds by the Baseball Association
was 8250. This, throuh the tufiu
ence of the Market St. Cable Co.,
was reduced to 8200, and by the gift
of the Omnibus Cable Co., to $175.
thfe litigation now on hand requires
a joint deposit of $1700.
In regard to the refunding of tick
ets lost by our sellers an agreement
was made by each university to be
responsible for a certain number of

tickets, to return either the tickets
or money. The same agreement
was made with those who handled
the tickets with the consequence in
our case that our sellers could not
account in their report for 45 tick
ets, which tickets our association
was compelled to make good.
Whether the sellers should be held
to their agreement we leave to the
decision of the Board.
