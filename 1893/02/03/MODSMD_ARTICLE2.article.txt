# HOW AND WHERE THE CREW SHOULD TRAIN.
## Dr. Penrose Makes some Good Suggestions. Berkeley to Have a Boat Club. 
### 
Dr. R A. F. Penrose Jr., Non
resident Lecturer in Economic
Geology, who rowed stroke oar on
Harvard's successful crew of'Bs, and
who is consequently an authority on
boating, as well as geological mat
tery, was interviewed to-day on the
boating question.
Dr. Penrose said that what our
crew most needed in the event of its
going to Chicago next summer to
compete in the iutercollegiate race
is practice in ordinarily rough or
choppy water. The little lake back
of the workshops, aside from being
unusually small for the maneuvers
of an eight oar shell, is far too placid
a body. The waters of Lake Mich
igan are exceedingly choppy and a
crew to make any sort of a showing
on the Chicago course must have
practice upon rough water.
"I know of many instances," Dr.
Penrose said, "when crews have lost
races on account of bein? used to
smooth waters only. It makes a
gieat difference. Before going east,
it is absolutely necessary thit the
crew should have a month's or even
two mouth's practice on rough
waters."
From what he had heard of Crys
tal Springs Lake, Dr. Penrose
thought that it would make a suit
able stretch upon which to practice.
"The lake back of the workshop,"
he said, "is entirely too small for
speed trial?, and in fact hardly long

enough fora good starting stretch.
The bay is the Lest place about here
upon which to practice. Haivartl
has her boat-house built upon marsh
land, and Stanford should be able to
obtain a suitabl; practice place,
either at some point opposite Palo
Alto, or farther north near Redwood,
or at San Mateo, where there is a
good beach. These places can bo
reached in a short time bj traiu."
"It is absolutely necessary" he re
marked again, "that the crew obtain
some bay practice. This will give
the men watermanship, which they
cannot obtain on a small lake, be
sides ample room for maneuvers."
Dr. Penrose then told what the
method of procedure should be in
forming the crew.
"As soon as possible the men
should be put to work on the row
ing machines in the gymnasium.
This practice will teach them the
stroke. In the east the candidates
are kept all winter at the rowing
machines"
"The men should be kept at this
work until a barge is obtained.
The eight oar barge is nearly twice
as heavy as a shell of the same num
ber of oars. They should practice
in this fora month or sis weeks be
fore trying a shell. Green men are
never able to manage a shell at the
first attempt."
Dr. Penrose being asked where a
barge could be most conveniently
obtained, suggested that the man
agement write to the Harvard, the
Yale, or the Cornell boating asso
ciations concerning this. These
boating associations are always sup
plied with extra barges, and one
could easily be obtained fora mod
erate sum and in a short time.
Regarding a coacli, Dr. Penrose
said one should be with the men
from the start. The men should
train as well and as faithfully as in
football. He was asked what he
thought of a side race between Stan
ford and the University of Chicago.
"That is a good idea," he said. "The
advantages on either side are about
even, and the race should be a very
interesting one."
The San Francisco morning papers
tell of the organization of the U. # 0.
Boating Club. With two college
crews on the coast, boating as a
branch of athletics will be on a
sound basis.
