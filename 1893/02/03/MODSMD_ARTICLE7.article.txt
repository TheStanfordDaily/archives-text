The uLaoccuntable sinallness of
the gate receipts from the great game
is being slowly and surely* explained
through the careful work of one of
Morse's detectives who was em
ployed by the two universities. We
publish the summary of the detec
tive's report, made to the universi
ties' lawyers. The report itself
covers twenty-four pages of closely
typewritten manuscript, and shows
careful and thorough work on the
part of this man who has already
ferreted out enough of the matter to
insure our lawyers in making prose
cutions against certain guilty par
ties.
