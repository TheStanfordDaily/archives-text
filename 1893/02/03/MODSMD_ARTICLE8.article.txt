The Misses Sherwood gave a most
charming music-ale in the Chapel
last evening. Owing to an oversight
the piano solo was omitted. Tbe
Stanford quartet was received with
the usual enthusiasm. The selec
tions rendered on the mandolin and
guiiar by the Misses Sherwood were
especially tine. Each showed a
complete mastery of both instru
ments, the expression and execution
being particularly finished. This is
the iiist musicale of the \ear, and it
is hoped tbat it will be followed by
many t ntertainments of the kind, s
they are conducive to the true col
lege spirit. M.y the Misses irhei
wood meet with every possible
success.
