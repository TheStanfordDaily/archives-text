# THE
						HAWAIIAN QUESTION.
## Interview with Prof. Brun, who Speaks Plainly Against Annexation. 
### 
Whether the Hawaiian Islands
shall be annexed to the United
States is a live question. Prof.
Brun was interviewed recently and
thus gave his opinion, which
means he is strictly opposed
to annexation. The first argu
ment is that the Kanakas can
not be trusted with legislation.;
Suppose, then, that we annex the
Islands, do the wealthy planters,
missionary party, and the people of
the United States propose to legis
late for the Islands froiuWashington?
As no rational man would propose
that, then the Islands must be erected
into a territorial government with
governor and judges appointed by
the President and confirmed by the
Senate; but the United States can
not avoid giving the inhabitants a
legislature of their own choosing,
nor can the United States disfran
chise the Kanakas, especially after
giving the southern negroes the
right of suffrage
The second argument in favor of
annexation is that the half-breeds
and trashy whites through unscru
pulous niean3 have gained the as
cendency, and constantly menace
the welfare of the Islands. This can
be briefly answered. Unless the
better part of the people have a
majority, the same unscrupulous
demagogues will continue to have
the controlling power after annexa
tion as before. And it is not prac
ticable to ship loads of virtuous San
Franciscans over there every time an
election is to be heldâ€”in other words
doing as in 1861, when elections
were carried on in Kansas by people
from other states. In the last election
in Louisiana, had the base supporters
of the lottery company been in the
majority, no state iu our Union
could have interfered. So in the
Islands, as long as the missionary
party is in the minority, and even if
they have a representative govern
ment they must submit to the ma
jority, however disreputable that
majority may be. Four thousand
Kanakas can not be legislated out
of their own soil, homes, and native
lights by a few foreigners.
The third argument put forth by
the revolutionists and some in the
United States is that the United
States needs the Islands fora coaling
station. This can be obtained by
treaty, let the government be what
it may. But should the United
States annex Hawaii, in case of war
with a foreign power, it would take

all our old "wooden tubs" in the
United States to defend it against
tiie enemy. It would compel a
division of our strength, which
otherwise might be concentrated on
our 13,000 miles of coast. The
United States is spending enough
on its navy now, and to take Hawaii
we must increase our tax.
