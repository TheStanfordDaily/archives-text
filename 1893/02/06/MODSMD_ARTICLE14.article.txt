It is doubtless slow work to create
habits in a university, as it is in in
dividuals. Habi tshave to be created,
however, and a most necessary one
in university life is that of sing
ing. There are students among us
who have splendid voices and are
able to develop the custom of sing
ing college songs. It is their duty
1o do this. '1 here are songs which
every university sings with slight
modifications to suit local circum
stances. No good reason exists why
these melodies should not be acclim
atized at Stanford. So far the
only choiusts we have heard have

been gospel hymns, "Bring back my
Bonn}*," and "There is a Tavern in
the Town." We don't want our
Bonny brought back any more, and
we know more about the tavern
than we wish we did. "What we
pine for ie Bingo, Co-cachee-lunk
che-Jay, Upidee-iday and some others
that will remind us that we are stu
dents. We want to hear "Hail,
Stanford, Hail " sung right for
once. The Tuesday evening lec
ture affords an opportunity for woik
in this direction and a little help
from the faculty would not be amiss.
