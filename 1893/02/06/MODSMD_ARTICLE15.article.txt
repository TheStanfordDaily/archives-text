# Ohm's Law Should be Modified.
## 
### 
The January number of the Lon
don, Edinburgh, and Berlin Philo
sophical Magazine now in the library
contains an article by Prof. Fernando
Sauford showing the variation of re
sistance of a metallic conductor ac
cording to the dielectic in its field of
force. As a result of Prof. San
ford's long and careful investigations
last year upon this scientific subject,
when he used a copper wire, aud his
careful experiments this year with a
silver wire, it will be necessary to
make a very material modification iu
Ohm's Law, which says that the
strength or intensity of an electric
current is directly proportional to
the electromotive force, and inversely
proportional to the resistance of the
circuit.
