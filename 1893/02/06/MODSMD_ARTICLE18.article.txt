# An Eventful Cruise.
## 
### 
Last Friday at midnight four
students started in a sloop from
this shore of the distant bay with
the intention of sailing to San Fran
cisco where they hoped to arrive at
early dawn. The small boat was
leaning well over and was scudding
along under a six knot breeze with
al 1 sail sat when something hap
pened.
Gardner was standing on the lea
ward gunwale. Rankin was at the
tiller. Smith was somewhere experi
encing the anguish of a man who
had never been on rough water be
fore. And Stuchell was clinging to
the top of the slender mast up which
he had climbed to fasten a rope.
Gardner slipped as the boat tacked,
made a futile lunge at a loose rope,
and plunged into the cold waters of
the bay. The bDat gave a sudden
lurch as Gardner left it; but that
lurch threw Stuchell far out into
the murky darkness, like a stone
thrown from a catapult.
Uankin laughed a loud, aggravat
ing laugh. Even Smith smiled in
his misery. The boat sailed on
about two hundred yards before the
helmsman bethought himself to turn
her about and pick up his compan
ions, who called loudly—called
mauy things besides loudly—for him
to quit laughing like a —gentleman,
and bring the boat back. So ended
the first cruise of the midnight
quartet.
