There is considerable complaint
about the way matters are running
at the Co-operative store. Even
those who furnish tLe capital for
carrying on the business are charged
more than they would be elsewhere.
For instance, "Elements of Graphic
Statics," by Prof. L. M. Hoskius,
can be purchased in tLe city for
$2.25, and here members are charged
$210. There are many other books
that could be mentioned.
Last week's Srquoia contained an
editorial that was right to the point.
It said the student body had a right
to an itemized account of the foot
ball funds. When one considers
that about $0,000 passes through the
Co op every year and the prices
charged ate too high, is it not high
time that on itemized account be fur
nished the students? Last year a
mouthly report was made. As it is
the students know nothing about the
business. The Co-op. could be
made a success and at the same time
be a great accommodation to stu
dents. One thing is very suie, it is
neither a success nor an accommoda
tion to the majority of the student
body now. Let us have an itemized
account soon, or at least a satisfac
tory report. A Member.
