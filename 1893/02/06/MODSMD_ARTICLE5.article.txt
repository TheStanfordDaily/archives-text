# The 						Alaskan and Pueblo Indians.

### 
This morning Prof. Gilbert enter
tained the class iu Pacific Slope His
tory with an interesting and instruct
ive lecture on the Alaskan Indiaus.
He spoke principally of the natives
of south eastern Alaska and those of
the Aleutian Islands, both of which
districts he visited last summer. The
Indians of the south-east coast, which
is fringed with hundreds of small
islands separated from the mainland
and from each other by narrow
winding straits, are the greatest
wood-workers of all the North Amer
ican Indians. The shores and
islands are covered with timber, from
which the natives make canoes, bas
kets, rope, fishing implements, etc.
The Aleutes live in a region al
most destitute of trees, and they rely
almost entirely upon the skins and
bones of animals from which to
make their clothing, their fishing
tackle, their canoes, and their in
struments.
All the Alaskan Indians are much
further advanced in civilization than
any of the other North American
tiibes; but they have a very low
standard of morality.
After Prof. Gilbert's lecture F. J
Batchelder, '94, described the man
ners and custom' of the Pueblo In
dians of Arizona and New Mexico.
Mr. Batchelder began by giving a
brief account of the early history of
these peculiar people and then told
of his experience among them and
what he had seen iu their towns
during his visit last summer.
Both Prof. Gilbert and Mr. Batch
elder displayed quite a collection of
curios peculiar to the tribes about
which they spoke.
