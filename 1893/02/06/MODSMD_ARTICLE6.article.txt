# Sunday Service.

### 
Rev. A. H. Briggs led the services
in the Chapel Sunday morning. His
subject was"The Cross of Christ."
His text was taken from Galatians,
sixth chapter, fourteenth verse.
He considered his subject under
three heads: what is the Cross of
Christ, what sentiments do we hold
toward the Cro9s, and what relation
do we hold to the Cross. He said
that the Cross of Christ was not the
one upon which He was crucified,
but the spiritual oue of human suf
fering which He was forced to bear.
God leads through pain to purity.
We all must bear our crosses in this
life. Our deepest joy is born of
pain, hence we should not regret
the crosses we havebbora.n a .
