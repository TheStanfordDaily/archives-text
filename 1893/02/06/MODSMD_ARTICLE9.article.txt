The regular meeting of the
Euphionian Society was held Satur
day evening at 7:30 in room 31 in
the quadrangle A thoughtful essay
was presented by \\\ N. Tobie.
The debate was upon the question,
Resolved, That the policy of the
L S. J. IT. with regard to e'.ectives
should be maintained. The speakers
for the affirmative were Yv\ H. Scliulte
and J. A. Colliver; for the negative,
C. J. Pierson aud A. M. Cathcart.
The regular debate was followed by
a general discu-sion which lasted a
hall'hour. The question being one
in which all were interested, the dis
cussion was .very lively, and some
strong joints were brought out hy
both sides.
A feature which added much to
the interest uf the evening's exer
cises was a declamation by E. P.
Dodd. This society's aim is to fur
nish an opportunity for broad liter
ary training, aud to that end recita
tions, essays, aud orations, as well
as debates, will find a place on its
programs.
