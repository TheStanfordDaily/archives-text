# Fraternities at the World's Fair.
## 
### 
It has been decided that the gen
eral meeting of the college fra
ternity men under the auspices of
the World's Fair Auxiliary in Chi
cago will be held during the week
beginning July IG, 1593, during the
Educational Congress. This con
gress will have for its business dis
cussions and reports upon the gen
eral subjects of fraternity govern
ment, journalism, secrecy and
rivalry, etc. There will also be a
separate congress for sororities. A
lecal committee and advisory coun
cil thoroughly representative of the
entire fraternity system have al
ready been appointed.
Concerning the matter of a col
lege fraternity exhibit at the World's
Fair. Gertrude E. Small, Kappa
Kappa Gamma has an excellent sug

gestion in the last number of the
College Fraternity. Space is already
so limited that the fraternities are
in danger of being crowded in such
small quarters as to make their dis
play uninteresting to non-fraternity
men. Therefore Miss Small sug
gests that the exhibit be in the
nature of a general one, that the
fraternities contribute equally to
build out of a common fund some
structure, small of course, but es
sentially Greek in design, which
should not only be an attractive
feature of the exposition in itself,
but serve besides to house the var
ious fraternity emblems used to dec
orate it. Inside, and outside too if
need be, might be grouped badges,
banners and shields, making a
bright, attractive decoration. To
this, which would naturally be to the
public the most striking feature of
the exhibit, should be subordinated
the literature of the fraternities.
This may, however, be given space
in the book cases which should run
around the room and could act as
shelves for photographs and stand
ing frames.
We think the suggestions good
ones and do not see how an exhibit
of interest to the general public can
be made auv other way.
