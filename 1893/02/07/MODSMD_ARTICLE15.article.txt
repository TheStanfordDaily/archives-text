We have always venerated the
paste-pot and shears, and are pleased
to note that certain correspondents
for Sin Francisco and San Jose pa
pers have a liindly leaning in the
same direction. But we also have a
feeling of anguish when we see afore
said correspondents clip ad infinitum
from our columns, and leave the de
luded public a high opinion of their
own merits as news gatherers. Kind
friends, it takes but a few moments
to insert after clippings from our
columns the words "Palo Alto,"
and then you do the honorable
thing.
