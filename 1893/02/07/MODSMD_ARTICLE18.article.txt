We dislike to run the risk of tir
ing our readers with a continual re
ference to one subject, but we must
run the risk in order to secure a
general feeling regarding any one

matter of University interest. There
must be a united effort on the pait
of all students and an especial
amount of energy on the part of a
few to do anything in the way of
musical organization. We do need
and we must have a glee club.
Every little one-horse college is
able to support a piece of a glee
club, but we have enough material
here to secure an organization that
will add a great deal to the pleasure
of university life and at the same
time bring us into prominence be
fore the public generally.
