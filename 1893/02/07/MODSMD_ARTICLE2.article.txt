# The 						Geological Department.

### 
This department has just received
a large and valuable consignment of
instruments for the study of petro
graphy and physical mineralogy;
among these are a large Fuess mi
croscope for the study of thin sec
tions of rocks and minerals. The
lenses of this instrument are so ar
ranged that the object-- may be stud
ied in parallel as well as convergent
polarized light. Along with this
microscope are all the accessories;
a full set of oculars including the
ordinary ones, as well as Calderon
oculars, and micrometer ocular no.
4, a full set of objectives; a quartz
wetlge showing the first three orders
of colors; a selinite wedge; a quar
ter-undulation mica plate for deter
mining the character of the double
refraction; also a sensitive quartz
plate; a gypsum plate giving red
of the Ist order; a Noerremberg
polarizing apparatus to use in study
ing thick plates of minerals in con
vergent light; a Dichroscope with
the imprcverr.eut of Prof, von Lang;
a perpendicular polarizing instru
ment for studying thick sections of
minerals in parallel polarized light;
presses to show the double refrac
tion caused by pressure and others
to show the twinning of calcite along
the slipp'.rg planes when subjected
to uniform pressure.
The mineralogical section is now
fitted cut with very fine appliances

for the purpose of instruction and
investigation, especially in the line
cf physical crystallography, more es
pecially mineral optics. The models
to illustrate the wave surfaces and
other surfaces of elasticity, and the
mineral plates and instruments to
study with, are unsurpassed in this
country.
By the beginning of the next se
mester there will be many other in
struments added as the students
advance in their work and the needs
of the department increase.
