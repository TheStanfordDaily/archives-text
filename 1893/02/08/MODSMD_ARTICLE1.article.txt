# ALPHA-CONGRESS DEBATE.
## Public Speaking Learned at College. 
### 
All the arrangements have been
made to insure u successful outcome
of the debate between tie Alpha aud
Congress. After mucTi squabbling
over the choice of a question tue
following one was selected: Resolved,
That the Hawaiian Islands should
be annexed to the United States.
Messrs Gruwell, Warren and Cham
berlain, representing Congress, will
affirm the question, and Messrs.
Bannister, A. C. Trumbo and Rhodes
will deny it for Alpha. The choice
of such a live question as the one
selected ought to lend additional
zeal and enthusiasm to the interest
already taken. The judges have
not yet been agreed upon. The
evening of February 25th will find
the chapel crowded with an appre
ciative audience.
