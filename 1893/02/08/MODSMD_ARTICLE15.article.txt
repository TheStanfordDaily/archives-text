# Are We All University Students?

'It would not be a very difficult
matter to make a census of the real
university students in this country.
It would include only thoie who,
having had a preliminary education
at a college or scientific shool, are !
carjying on graduate studies under
a faculty especially organized for the
purpose of conducting courses cf
higher instruction and research. In
such a census Columbia would head
the list with over GOO universitj*'
students, Harvard would follow
closely with over 550, Vale would ;
come thiid with about 425, and
Johns Hopkins fourth with about
350. The University of Chicago,
Cornell University, Stanford Uni
versity, and the Universities of Mich- j
igan and Wisconsin would furnish
perhaps 2">o or 300 more. A Mv
otlier> are scattered over the country. I
So that there are nearly 2,500 bona
tide university students enrolled in
the United States at present. With
this it is interesting to compare the
enrollment at the leading foreigu
universities, as reported in Trub
ner's "Minerva:" Vienna, 0,020;
Berlin, 5,;>71; Naples, 4,592; Leipsic.
3,431; Edinburgh, 3,387; Munich,
3,292; Oxford, 3,212; and P«iis,
10,212. The strict comparison of

the two sets of figures is unfair,
however, since all students who are
enrolled in the jutior ard senior
classes of the ordinary American
college would be classed as univer
sity students in Europe."
This article, which is taken from
tbe Chris/inn Union of -January 21,
continues farther on referring to
"Minerva": "If it is intended to con
fine the book to universities alone,
then from the American list the
names of Amherst, Hamilton, and
"Williams, as being colleges only,
and those of the Universities of Cal
ifornia, Texas, Kansas, Minnesota,
Virginia, the City of New York, and
Yanderbilt University, as being uni
versities in name only, should be
dropped. If colleges are to he in
cluded, then the American repre
sentation would have to be increased
indefinitely."
