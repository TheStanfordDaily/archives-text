# Thomas Carlyle.
## 
### 
The usual Tuesday evening lect
ure was given by Prof. Flugel, it be
ing his first appearance before an
English speaking audience.
All the literary material on Car
lyle is one sided. Little has been
added to it si'ce the publications of
Mrs. Carlyle. Usual'y the person
ality of the critic shows too plainly.
In remains impossible to formulate
hi 3 theology. In "Sartor Resartus"
he expounds on the great mystery of
human life. Science strives vainly
to interpret space and time. In vain
we strive to strike them off. The
curtains of yesterday roll down, and
those of to-morrow roll up, but both
are. Only the shadows of time per
ish. Whatever i-», is, and always
will be.
"We are such stuff as dreams are
made cf." Man begins in darkness
and ends in darkness. All is mys
tery. Out of all evil comes good.
Behind each one of us there are six
thousand years of human effort and
conquest, and before us, all eternity.
The universe as we see it is au in
finite and divine mystery.
Carlyle's religious idealism is faced
by a mechanical world of criticism.
He believed his mission was to at
tack the experiments of all sciences,
for they tended to destroy the mor
ality of the world. There is no
doubt that his views are expressed in
exaggeration, but there is also no
doubt of their soundness, if taken
with a grain of salt.
Carlyle believed the essence of
Christian doctrine to be implanted
in every human heart. Christianity
is the worship of sorrow. The
Christian religion once here will

stay. The question of religion Las
been di-sipating itself into meta
physics.
Carlyle's whole life was tilled witL
gloom an.l sadness. lie looked up
to Goethe's happy spirit His heart
is tilled with hatred of the unworthy.
He forgets that al! sins mutt be for
given. Carlyle's birth, life, and
whole nature denied hirn the happy
light of Goethe's nature.
