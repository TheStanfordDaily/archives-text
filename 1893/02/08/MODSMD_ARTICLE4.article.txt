### 
This morning's Examiner contains
a long article on the collection of
euros and relics for the Stanford
Museum The idea of making such
Â°
a collection was suggested to Mrs
S'anford by her son, who gathered
many little objects of interest during
a trip through Europe, while he was
only eleven years o!d.
The meagre nucleus collected by
a boy to decorate his owu room has
been increased by continued ad
ditions] during many years. The
Stanford Museum may boast an as
sortment of old weapons, stone im
plements, and other strange,rare and
beautiful things that any university
might well be pioud fo possess.
