# PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES.
## A
						Resolution Proposed That will Exclude the Professional Element and Tend to Purify College Athletics. The
						University of Pennsylvania Objects to the New Resolutions. 
### 
"No member of a graduate depart
ment or special student shall be eli
gible, nor any undergraduate who is
registered or has attended lectures
or recitations at any other university
or college, nor any undergraduate
who is not pursuing a course for a
degree requiring an attendance for
at least three years "
The above resolution has stirred
up a violent commotion in eastern
college athletic circles. It has teen
conceded that the field of college
sports needs purifying, and as a
jpiece of remedial legislation this res
olution has been offeree! as a substi
tution for the present clause in the
intercollegiate rules governing the
requirements of players. Yale and
Princeton are in hearty sympathy
with the resolution. The Harvard
Crimson says in regard to the action:
Harvard is thoroughly in sym
pathy with the de ire to puiify ath
letic.-? in every possible way, and to
take any fair, sensible, and prudent
step to bring this about The ex
isting troubles c m be remedied in a
better mode than by applying this
rule to every department of the uni
versity. Moreover, Harvard espec
ially objects to agreeing to such a
rule as shall apply to students now
in college.
The mo t violent opposition conies
from the University of Pennsylvania,
â€¢upon which the lule falls with the
heaviest consequences. At a large
auass meeting of the students of that
siniversity last week the following
resolutions were passed in regard to
the controversy:
Kesolved, That the undergradu
ates of the University of Pennsylva
nia, while ready to join in any care
fully considered movement for the
purification of undergraduate a'blet
ies, enter their earnest protest against
the recent amendment to the con
stitution of the Iute r collegiate Foot
ball Associat on, debarring certain
classes of bona-fide undeigraeluate
students from playing on university
teams.
1. Because such legislation fails
to recognize the broad distinction
between a university aiiel a college,
and the right of students of all de
partments to compete in any and all
branches of university athletics.
2. Because such legislation will,
if allowed to stand, check the

hea'thy competition for places on
football teams by restricting the area
of competition; will thus decrease
the piesent wide-spread interest in
tbe game, detract largely from its
character, and hamper its Lormal de
velopment as a university sport.
3. Because, even if tbe foregoing
reasons be not accepted as conclu
sive, we confidently ho'd that such
radical legislation should Le pros
pective in its app'ication, and that at
least one year's notice should be
given before earn ing it into effect
R solved, That the students of
tbe University of Pennsylvania wish
to place themselves on record as in
favor of any just legislation to eradi
cate existing evils in intercollegiate
athletics, and we hereby heartily rec
ommend the plan suggested by Mr.
Casper W. Whitney in the issue of
Harper's Weekly for January 2S, 1803,
as providing an effective remedy for
tbe abuse complained of.
Resolved, also, That, inasmuch
as the recent legis'ation affects not
only athletic contests, but also other
important interests and relations in
American university life, therefore,
it is the sense of this meeting that
this legislation should not in fairness
be treated as final, but should be
subject to a careful review by a con
ference composed of delegates repre
senting the trustees, faculties, and
undergraduates of the several insti
tutions affected
llesolved, That the Athletic As
sociation of the University of Penn
sylvania be requested to appoint a
commit te: with instructions and
power to biing about such a con
ference
Walter Camp says in regard to
the new lule proposed: "I have ad
vocated and would still advocate a
much more stringent rule, namely,
that no man be eligible for uuivers
ity team until be bad passed one full
year in res : dence."
Casper W. Whitney in Harper'*
1 \cck r y suggests these remedies:
A man is eligible to membership
of a varsity team:
1. When he is a bona-fide stud
ent, regularly enrolled on the uni
versity register, and in good stand
ing
2 When he basnet bceu a mem
ber of any other university or col
lege team, or played on a class team
at any other colbge or university.
3. When be is taking the same
number of lectures as are prescribed
in the academic course either in one
of the professional schools or as a
regular student of the university in
any other capacity.
4 When he lias not been a mem
ber of the university more than four
years.
5. When, if he is challenged, he
produces certificates from the faculty
of his university, showing him to be
pursuing the required course.
G. These rules to cover football,
rowing, track athletic 3, and other in
tercollegiate sports.
Everyone interested in track ath
letics will look upon the outcome of
this innovation with a great deal of
interest. If this rule be passed, it

will certainly tend to purify athlet
ics, and will have a very marked ef
fect in checking the tendency of in
troducing professionalism in college
sports.
