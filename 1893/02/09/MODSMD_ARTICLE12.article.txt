Stanford looks forward with a
great deal of interest to the solution
of the controversy raging i.i the east;
over the amendment proposed for
the rules governing the intercollegi- j
ate contests. As yet we have not j
reached that stage which requires
sucli strict rules as those made nec-;
essary in the eastern colleges, but it!
remains with us as a burning issue
to start n renovation in our ouu
athletic interests, and to put them
on a higLer plane than the present, j
Our athletics have k bright future,
and it behooves us to prepare for
those exigencies that are bound to
come in time. To exclude the pro
fessional element and admit none
but the genuine college athlete who
plays from the right mo'ives, it
seems fitting and appropriate that we
should adopt regulations, at least as !

strict as the fallowing in regard to
our athletic teams:
" Fiist, no ' special' in any depart
. meut to be eligible
" Second, no professional student
to be eligible unless a graduate of
: some reputable college.
"Thiid.no man to play for hi,
college longer than four years."
These regulations are peiftctly
simple and e;isy to enfoice, and
surely would exclude all objec'ion
uble elements.
