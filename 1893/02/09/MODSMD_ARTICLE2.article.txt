# Track Athletic Captain.
## 
### 
C. A, Fernald was elected captain
of the track athletic team, at a meet
ing held last evening for that pur
pose. Fernald won second place in
both the maiden and open hundred
yards dashes at the annual field day
last May, being defeated by C. C.
Adams, ex-'9-">. He also won a
medal for the same event at the
Olympic Club iield day held last
Thanksgiving. The new captain is
a promising sprinter and a consci
entious trainer, and there is no doubt
but he will till his position credit
ably
