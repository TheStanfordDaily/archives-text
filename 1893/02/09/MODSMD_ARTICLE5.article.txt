### 
A mass meeting of the students of
the State University was held yes
terday afternoon to take action in
regard to a boat club. It was an en
thusiastic meeting at which both
faculty and students showed them
selves heartily in favor of the pro

tions in respect to a boating associa
tion and boat house were discussed,
but nothing definite was accom
plished. It is to be hoped that the
enterprise will not fall through
on account of the expense and diffi
culties that first arbe. Constant
agitation of the question and the
spirit of rivahy already engendered
by cur football contests will keep
the i?sue alive, no doubt, and finally

formulate an org inizatiou that will
be the source of u gieit intereoUegi
