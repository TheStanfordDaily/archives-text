# Athletics at Chicago in June.
## 
### 
The athletes of the university
should begin to consider seriously
the coming contests. Jnne 3 the
athletic teams cf the colleges com
prising the Northwestern College
League ill meet at Chicago fora
grand field day. The representative
men of each department of athletics
will enter from Ann Arbor, Minne
sota, Noithwestein, and Wisconsin,
and it behooves us tJ have our men
well prepared for the struggle.
It would be worse than folly to
send a team of men who, though
naturally fitted fora contest, are yet
unprepared fora thorough course of
training to meet the trained athletes
who will represent such colleges as
Ann Arbor, Minnesota, and North
western. Wisconsin must takefront
rank in the contest. That we have
creditable material has been shown
by the records of our field-day.
Let all whese talent lie iu that
direction begin to train, that a large
field may be presented from which
to select the representative team. â€”
Dailv Cardinal.
