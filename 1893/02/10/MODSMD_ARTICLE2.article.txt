Editors Daily Palo A.lto:
It appears to me that the most dis
tinguishing characteristic of our
student body is "kicking." The
Board of Athletic Directors have pa
tiently borne the brunt of all the
objections and insinuations which
have been hurled at them, and seem
to be doing all in their power to al
leviate the troubles of their respect
ive athletic constituencies. Yet I
must beg leave to register an ob
jection which is necessary to the
cause of justice.
When the magic word was flashed
through the University that Camp
had been secured to coach our foot
ball team, the shrewd authorities
took advantage of the intense excite
ment then prevailing to replenish
our more than bankrupt treasury.
A Ave dollar subscription list was
staited, but some gave vent to their
enthusiasm by making it ten. List
upon list was tilled until between
$700 and £SOO was pledged in a few
hours. The management made a
partial collection of these pledges
about two weeks later, and when
enough had been received to pay the
expenses of the team, the whole list
was laid aside and has not been seen
since! Out of this seven or eight
hundred dollars, $407.50 has been
collected. Is it not right that every
five dollars be paid? No man has a
right to put his name to a five dol
lar subscription list when he knows
he will nut be able to pay it. Most
of those who are delinquent are so
from the fact that they have never
been asked to pay, yet many have
declared that there are funds enough

in the treasury, and the management
has no right to their money when
such is the case.
The fact of the matter is, the ath-1
letic treasurer has iu bank a little
over $1,100, as can be peen by re
ferring to the football report as pub- j
lished in the Palo Alto some days
ago. Of this, of all our high-flown
athletic schemes, new track, baseball
grounds, etc., .$750 is under litiga
tiou by the Bay City Wheelmen for
rental of the grounds. Besides this,
a large number of minor bills remain
to be paid which will nearly empty
the treasury. Then the question
will arise, where will the money
come from to place football on its !
feet next fall? There is only one
way out of the difficulty. The foot
ball committee of the Board of Ath
letic Directors should resurrect that
old subscription list, and even if the
patriotism of its signers has decayed
into a morbid drowsiness, yet every ,
man will surely pay his honest debts !
