# Change in Fare in Encina.
## 
### 
Since the change in cooks at
Eucina there has been an improve
ment in the fare, and wholesome
food is now the order of the day.
The new cooks are French chefs,
and take a lively interest in their
work. It is to be hoped the good
beginniug will be kept up and that
no more complaints will be rendered
necessary on the ground of ill-pre
pared material. As was previously
stated in these columns, not the
quantity but the quality was what
was amiss.
