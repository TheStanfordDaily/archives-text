# The
						Undergraduate Rule.
## 
### 
The position which Yale has taken
in her recent action disagreeing with
the rule passed by her athletic man
agers is certainly fairer and more
sportsmanlike than it would have
been had she agreed with their rul
ing. It tends, moreover, to better
the prosi)ects of an amicable and
speedy agreement between the col
lege and Hiuvard.
I Bv this ac'ion Yale hhows herself

opposed to the idea of»lie college in
athletics and in fa\or of the univers
ity in athletics, which is what Har
vard will doubtless stand for herself.
Harvard's desire to eliminate pro
fessionalism from athletics was well
defined three years ago when the
well known proposition made then
unfortunately fell through on ac
count of disagreements on minor
points. The desire is still as strong,
but the method of reform has as
sumed a broader character. The
athletic committee is at present con
sidering the best means of accom
plishing the reform, and steps are
being taken to learn the sentiments
of the athletic men on the subject.
It is impossible to s-peak at length
on this matter uutil Harvard takes
her final position; and this action
may be looked for within the com
ing week —Harvard Cximson.
