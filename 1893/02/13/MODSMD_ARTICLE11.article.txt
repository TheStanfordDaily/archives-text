In a recent issue of the Univer
sity of Chicago's list of students and
courses, it is found that the total
number of students enrolled is five
hundred and ninety-four. These are
nearly one-third theological stu
dents. The theological department
has Veen in exi-tence t-everal years
and has been incorporated into the
main body of the university. These
students may do religious work in
the city and receive for it three dol
lars a week and upwards. They
also receive a furnished room free of
charge in Divinity Dormitory accom
odating 140 students, and built by
Mr. l»oekefeller. It is also stated
in the catalogue that the theological
students can earn in addition to this
about ?100 a year.
The next largest department is
that of the graduate students, IGG in
number, and for these there are 40
fellowships and other pecuniary aids.
Apparently n, number of those
registered ns graduate students
would not ba considered as such at
Cornell. Add to these 71 special
students and there remains only 175
as the total registration for the four
under-sraduate classes. — Cornell
