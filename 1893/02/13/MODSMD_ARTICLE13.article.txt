With the advent of what appears
to be au annual siege of measles at
Encina Hall, the lack of proper ac
commodations for sick students is
again brought to notice. There
should be an infirmary on the
campus—a cosy, well-arranged, well
lighted, but not necessarily expen
sive house, where contagious diseases
could be properly and quietly cared
for by professional nurses, or per
haps by the students' own relatives
or friends, without endangering the
welfare of every other student at the
University. Last year only one of
the numerous sicknesses in Encina
proved fatal, and that possibly
might have been avoided if there
had been a quiet house near at hand
to which the patient could have
been moved in the early stages of
his illness. The ball, with its bad
cooking and the necessary noise
caused by over three hundred stu
dents, was and is yet a very unhandy
place in which to be sick. The fact
that the measles spread to sixteen
cases in Encina last year shows
that the hall is a fertile field fora
contagion. How large a number
may we expect the disease to attack
this year when it begins a month
earlier than last year, and in its fiist
week has four patients on its list.
It is difficult and often dangerous to
move an ill person from one of the
halls to so great a distance as Menlo
Park or San Francisco, so he has to
be kept in a place where the little
delicacies that are so much needed
by a sick person, cannot be obtained.
Were there an infirmary convenient
to the halls, sickness would in some
cases be an absolute comfort to the
student.
As we look at the rnatler we won
der that some provision was cot
made before for the accommodation
of the 6ick. But then the wonderful
healthfulness and mildness of this
climate does not suggest the idea of
the prevalence of sickness.
Would this not be a worthy mat
ter for the Btudents as a boely to take
in band? By individual contribu
tions, by the proceeds of numerous
Btudent entertainments got up for

the purpose, quite a respectable sum
could be raised towanl securing a
safe and home-like dwelling for sicli
studtn's. No one need feel that bis
money is not being used in a good
cause when be devotes it to such a
purpose. Careful attendance for the
sick, and the preservation of life
wLen it is being weighed in the bal
ance, are motives that should inspire
all of us to unselfish resolutions.
