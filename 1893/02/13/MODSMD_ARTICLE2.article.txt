Rev. li. J. BriggsofSau Francisco
led the services in the chapel. He
invited attention to tbe second verse j
of the third chapter of St. John.
It matters not what we are, or
what we have been; but what we I
shall be interests, all. All men revel
in worlds of their own creation.
They indulge themselves in day
dreams and air castles. This habit
is perilous to practical success, but
it proves that man is not contented
with to-day. This faith in the fu-j
ture is the very bone and sinew of
life. The object of the wise educa
tion is to suggest a bright future
towards which one may aspire.
Hope enables us to endure. All
should look towards the endless fu
ture beyond the gates of death.
When man loses his seuse of immor
tality he surrenders his title to self
respect and his highest prerogatives.
Man, that is immortal man, has
three great powers—the power of
knowing, the power of feeling, and
the power of acting. By these he is
holy or unholy, righteous or unright
eous. Man teaches man what he
may become, but the future glory of
the soul remains incomprehensible.
