The regular meeting of Congress
Friday night was very well attended.
The presence of a number of young
ladies, four of whom became mem
bers, created a feeling of confidence
even in the most doubting, that Con
gress has a bright future before it.
The Field resolution favoiiug the
annexation of the Hawaiian Islands
was freely discussed, tha majority of
speakers being opposed to it. The
resolution was laid on the table.
Titles of new bills were announced
as follows: Providing for the annex
ation of Utah as a state into the
union; Providing for the abolish
ment of capital punishment.

It is gratifying indeed to those
who labored so earnestly to get the
young ladies admitted to Congress
to see that they have at la9t under
taken the work. It is now in order
for the young ladies to follow the!
splendid start made by the four.
