The Alpha met on Saturday night
with a largely increased attendance.
The evening was made eujoyable by
the presence of so many young
ladies. This also lent interest to the
question for debate, which was, "Re
solved, That the divorce laws should
be abolished." Speeches were made
by Messrs. Tirnm and Maxwell on
the affirmative, and Henderson aud
Kennedy on the negative Mr.

speech on James G. Blaine. Ex

by W. C. Hazzard, on "The National
University"; by H. T. Trumbo, on
"The Stanford Crew at Chicago";
and by li. 1). Melvin, on "Cholera
