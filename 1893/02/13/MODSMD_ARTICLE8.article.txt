# IMMIGRATION QUESTION.
## Dr. Jordan Thinks that there Should Be Some Property and Intellectual Qualification 
### 
President Jordan, in a recent is- >
sue of the Chicago News, lias this to
say oti immigration:
A nation is made up of men and
women who can take care of them
selves and who know how to re-!
spect each other's vighte. All others
are parasites and hindrances.
In all old countries a certain por
tion of its people fall in the struggle
for existence and take to living on
the community instead of living by
the gain of honest work. These we
recognize as paupers, adventurers,
and professional criminals. The
qualities distinguishing these become
hereditary, and after some genera
tions the character of parasitism is
fixed and cannot be eradicated. An
enormous percentage of our native
paupers and thieves come from the
convict stock which England threw
into Virginia in the seventeenth
century. The great shave of the
paupers and thieves of our next cen
tury will arise from the pauper im
migration of to-day.
It may be that we have people
enough already and need no more
from Europe. This is a mere ques
tion of sentiment and deserves no
practical treatment. Not "America
for Americans," but "America for
good citizens," should be our watch
word.
But the rising flood of incompe
tents, paupers aud thieves must be
checked. The slums of Europe
poured over America would make of
it one vast slum, for there is no vir
tue in free institutions to reclaim
those whom heredity has debased
and destroyed. The important
question is not what language the
incomers speak or what their man
ners aud customs are. but whether
they will stand on their own teet
and do their part in the work of
making a nation.
Some test must be applied, and
this not at Castle Garden, but in the
consular offices in the cities from
which immigrants come
A property test has some value.
If too high, it will shut out deserv
ing young men and women. If too
low, it will permit "assisted immi
gration " A progressively increas
ing test—more for an older man or
a man with a family—would be more
efficient, but would tend to make
the administration more difficulty
Equally desirable is a test which
should exclude men without a def
inite profession or trade. No more
men without a training in some line
of useful industry are wanted in
America. The unskilled laborer is
the curse of labor. Every unskilled
laborer is at bottom an adveuturer.
A third test is that of education —
ability to read some language. This
should be a test of ambition and
force, not of having attended an
English school, hence, in my view,
one language is as good as another
, for it.
This inspection would throw an
addit : onal responsibility on Ameri

cau consuls. To give their duties
more importance would help to give
dignity to these positions, to place
them out of the reach of salf-seekers
and incompetents, to whom a large
proportion of these offices now
naturallv fall.
