The l'iological Club met last
iu room SO. The subject of the
evening lecture was -'The In
dian Island of Dominica" by Prof.
Dudley of the botanical department.
The island is of volcanic origin, and
is third iu size of the Lesser Antilles.
The highest mountains in this group
are found ou this island. Columbus
discovered the island and gave it the
name of Dominica, and it is of inter
est as being one of the first islands
known in the New "World. The
island is of great interest to the nat
uralist, for its high altitude and va
rious climates give large variety of
animal and vegetable life. It is free
from deadly serpents and other poi
souous creatures, and the numerous
lines of steamers make it easily ac
cessible. The royal and the cccoa
nut palm flourish; the trees are cov
ered with orchids, lichens, and other
curious plants, thus giving the for
ests a strange appearance. Many
birds found on this island are not
found elsewhere, but the mongoose
introduced to destroy snakes has
also exterminated several species of
birds. A small band ot Indians of
the famous Carib tribe still live on
Dominica, but are slowly becoming
extinct.
The next meeting of the Biolog
ical Club will be held on Monday
evening, Feb. 28th.
