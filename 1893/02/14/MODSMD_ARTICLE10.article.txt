Some time ago, iu a short talk vvi!b
Senator Stanford, some remarks
were dropped relating to the prac
tical phase of the work done here.
The idea of students working on
topics of the day, pleased him very
much. His ideal university is one
that fits the young people of to-day
for the earnest struggle in life to
morrow. Some years ago, when
steps had just been taken for the
founding of this university, he said
that often graduates from Yale and
Harvard had been sent to him with
letters of introduction, and they
were anx.ous for positions. Upon
asking what they could do, he found
that they were extremely ignorant of
the practical affairs of life, yet they
were learned in Latin and Greek,
and perhaps knew much of mathe
matics. This struck him very forc
ibly us not the ideal education, and
hence this university, which aims to
meet the wants of all who are striv
ing fora h'gher plane. We wish to
say that the Senator is highly
pleased with the work dene, and it
is in accordance with his idea that

all discussion should be on live
questions
There is a great tendency among
many college men to sink away
among dusty books, and thus not
make the most of life. It is a very
nice question to determine the exact
proportion that book learning per sc
bears to one'es knowledge of general
affairs in the truly successful man.
