A well educated popular opinion
inessential to the successful manage
ment of all enterprises. It is no less
true in the college woild than else
where. That which has true merit
should be commended by all, and
that which savors of selfishness or
low motives should receive the con
demnation it justly deserves. The
days of sedition laws are over and
one can freely express himself on all
issues, providirg he does it gentle
manly. We think that a certain
amount of criticism well put does a
great deal of good and everyone
should feel duty bound to help form
a popular opinion that reflects credit
and honor upon the whole institu
tion.
Properly expressed opinions need
not be confined to the student body.
If a professor or anyone in any way
connected with the institution does
not do the right thing, complaint
should be made at once. Not a
petty, insignificant complaint, char
acteristic of small critics, but a vig
orous objection stated with the
reason why. Just as much interest
should ba manifested in the other
direction, however, by speaking the
good word when deserved. Some
are apt to close their eyes to only
one side and thus form a very im
perfect judgment.
