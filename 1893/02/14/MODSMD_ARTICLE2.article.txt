# Japanese Schools

### 
A veiy interesting talk was given
on "Japanese Schools" by Miss
Ailing in Prof. Barnes' class last
night. Miss Ailing has taught in
Japan, and speaks from experience.
There is but one normal school in
Japan and few born teachers.
Teaching is a process of telling.
The master reads and the students
recite in concert. There is no idea
of order or discipline. No such
thing as corporal punishment is
known in schools, aud even in the
family it is avoided. Obedience and
duty to parents is instilled into the
child from birth. The Japanese
boys lack the boisterousness of the
American, taking part in quieter
games, and carrying himself in a
more sedate manner. His school
room is, however, much more un
tidy. The desks are &meared with
the thick ink used in wiiting.
Great precision is acquired in the
use of the brush, and many are
beautiful penmen. The Japanese
desire the education of the American,
and are anxious for our civilization.
They translate many of our text
books for their own U9e. They are
fond of philosophy, political econ
omy, history and law. The major

ity are good mathematicians, though
they have a peculiar dislike for that
science.
Japan is well provided with
schools, none of which are free.
Tuition is high and education is not
compulsory. The primary schools
are educational, and are taught by
both sexes. Women teach in' the
kindergartens. There is a system
of teachers certificates much like
our own. The normal school at
Tokio admits both boys and girls
Much is said against the higher edu
cation of women, who have been
kept from it until of late. It is dis
cussed as much as women's suffrage
is in this country.
Chinese is studied along with the
Japanese. The one bears the same
relation to the other as Latin does
to the romance languages. Their
book language is entirely different
from their spoken language, which is
never seen in print. Specialists
teach gymnastics, music, and eti
quette in the schools. Girls are
particularly drilled in the latter,
which forms a great part of their
lives.
