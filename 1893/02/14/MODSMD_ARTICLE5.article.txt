# SAFEGUARDS AGAINST PAUPERS
## Prof. Clark Advocates a Medical Examination as Well as an Intellectual and Property Qualification 
### 
Prof. Clark in a recent issue of
the Chicago News Record has this to
say on immigration:
As a single property tax or
educational test does not solve
the immigration question, there
should be a compound test in
order that the law of natural selec
tion may be subsidized for the end
in view—namely, the securing of the
foreign populations for American
citizenship. The test should be ap
plied in order to prevent fraud or
evasion of the law, first by the
American in the country of which
the emigrant is a native, and sec
ondly by the immigrant inspectors
at our ports. The immigrant should
be required to take an oath, admin
istered by the consul, that lie is the
possessor of at least fifty dollars cash
over and above the amount for pas
sage money and carfare to his desti
nation in America. If he has a fam
ily the sum should be fixed at §100.
Every male immi grant over fif
teen years of age should pass a cred
itable examination in the English
language. The consul should also
obtain data concerning immigrant's
occupation, place of birth, etc. The
data should be filed with the statis
tical bureau of the state department
in duplicate. Before the consul
conducts this test a certificate of suc
cessful medical examination should
be presented by the immigrant.
When the immigrant reaches our
port his certificate should be re ex
amined, and if any doubt arises as
to all of the tests applied, the in
spectors at their own discretion may
compel the tests to be made anew,
and if not found satisfactory, the
steamship company should be com
pelled to return the immigrant at
their own expense, unless it can be
proved that the foreign con
sul was guilty of irregular
ity, in which case the expense of the
deportation should be charged to
the consul, and deducted from his
salary. Fora secoud oft'ense the
consul should be dismissed from
office.
This system would discriminate
in favor of those nations having good
school systems where English is
taught, and in favor of thrifty immi
grants, prohibiting paupers, but not
the intelligent poor. The scheme
has the advantage also of being eco
nomical.
