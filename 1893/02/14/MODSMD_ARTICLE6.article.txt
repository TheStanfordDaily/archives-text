Editor Daily Palo Alto:
We have already seen how unbus
inesslike and how demoralizing
upon the contestants it is to have an
athletic event in the air and no defi
nite time set. Last semester no one
knew when the U. C.-Stanford game
would come off", and as a result some
of the men were training hard all

fall .•■while others <1 id not train until
the day was set. Let us, if possible,
see that this occurs no more. Let
us discuss the matter, find the best
day to have the game, and try to get
the game set on that day.
Some think we should abide by
eastern custom and have the game
on Thanksgiving, as the whole
country is alive with football at that
time. While we may follow custom
if it is light, yet when there is sucli
a difference between the fall climate
of the east and that of California, I
think we should not let eastern cus
tom prevail as to our football season.
The cool winter weather is better for
football practice than the early fall
when it is so hot The ground is
generally soft and grassy from re
peated showers, which saves many a
hard fall and maybe a severe injury.
"With the great game on Feb. 2'2d
we need not play hard {football but
about sis weeks, which length of
time is the same as in the east, and
it comes at the beginning of the
long semester, so that if a player
has neglected his work somewhat,
he still has time to catch up by the
end of the semester, which would be
much harder to do were the game
on Thanksgiving.
Another strong reason for Feb.
22d is that the best coaches can be
procured in January and February,
while we could not get them in No
vember on account of their being en
gaged elsewhere.
Having the game on the 22d need
not necessarily conflict with base
ball, as the grounds are generally
too wet, as they now are, for regular
practice before March. We could
just as well have two baseball sea
sons and two field days.
Now let some one give his reasons
for having the great game on Thanks
giving, and after the discussion, let
us bring it up in Students' meeting
and decide upon the best day; then
our manager will kuow what we
want when be meets the U. C. man
ager, and the day being set, out
captain will know better how to
train his men and to regulate the
practice games. S. D. B.
