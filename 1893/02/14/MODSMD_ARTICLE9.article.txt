A few days ago we spoke a few
words in reference to tbe starting of
a dramatic club. Those who have
given tbe subject any thought have
reported favorably, and some are
very anxious that the matter take
some definite shape soon. The work
done iu English as well as in the
romance languages is such as gives
excellent opportunities for this kind
of an association. There is no doubt
that it will be well represented acd
become very popular, if conducted
under proper management. There
is a lack of cohesive influence in the
university, which will be to a great
extent overcome by this organiza
tion. Every student should be inter
ested in some special organization
whose object is the development of
college talent. In order that some
thing may be done at once, those
interested should speak to any of the
editors, and if requested, the consti
tution of the Princeton Club will be
published. Let some one take the
lead iu the matter immediately.
