# SANTA BARBARA FLORAL CARNIVAL.
## An Inter-Collegiate Football Game May Be One of Its Attractions. 
### 
Mr. W. A. Ilawley, a Yale grad
uate and state assemblyman from
Santa Barbara County, was at the
University this forenoon in the in
terests of the Sauta Barbara Floral
Carnival, which will be held April
11th to 14th inclusive.
It is the wish of the carnival di
rectors that there be a great collegi
ate football game on the last day,
and they have guaranteed to pay all
the expenses of both universit}',
teams. Mr. Ilawley has visited
Berkeley, and the U. C. faculty will
decide this afternoon whether or not
to give the team a vacation for that
occasion. Our faculty will give J
their decision before to-morrow. If,
permission b_> given by both the
faculties for the absence of their re-1
spective trains, two elevens will be
formed with U. C. and Stanford,
men on each one; so that there will 1
be no infringement on the intercol-j
legiate playing rnles.
Santa Barbara is a quaint, pictur
esque old Spanish town on the
coast nearly two hundred and fifty j
miles south of here. Its population
numbers about seven thousand per-1
sons, a large number of whom have
come from eastern states in search
of health and a quiet place in a land
where tropical fruits and flowers
abound. When President Harrison
visited California on his western trip
two years ago, a floral carnival was
got up in his honor. The principal
features of the display were a bat
tle of flowers and a grand street
parade of hundreds of conveyances
completely covered with different
kinds of flowers. The display was
so successful and attracted so much
notice for its uniqueness, not only
on this coast but in the east, that it'
was determined to tr.ake the floral
carnival a great annual festivity.
Last year's carnival week was de
voted to floral street parades, battles
of flowers, a floral regatta on the
smooth waters of the bay, and sev
eral grand Spanish balls at which
early California costumes were worn.
The battle cf flowers, which is
similar to the annual floral fete at
Nice, only a much greater variety
and quantity of flowers being used,
consists of a friendly pelting of small
bouquets by the young lady aud
young gentleman occupants of the
decorated carriages as they pass
each other in a continuous double
line.
