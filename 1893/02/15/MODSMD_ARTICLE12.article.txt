Where are all our biseball play
ers? Time and again this question
Las been asked with a feeling of
anxiety, yet no one seems able to
answer it. We have lar more good
ball players in the university now
than ever before, and the Bmall
number of men in training casts dis
credit on nn institution having over
seven hundred and sixty students.
If the announcement were made
that a southern trip had been ar
ranged, what a lush for positions
there would be! This spirit wi'l
not make a winning team. Only
hard and faithful work can do it,
and the faithful few who have prac

ticcd from the first s! otld be remem
bered by tbe captain.
Has college spirit died out amoiig
u:? Withhold this enthusiasm and
you draw the very sap of life out of
college athletes. The holding back
of so rnauy men shows that this
spirit is ut least weak. It shows
that they want a prize dangling
before their eyes before they will
even attempt to grasp it. A match
game is scheduled 'or Feb 2 Jd, and
our team is in a deplorable state.
There are hardly enough candidates
to fill the positions, and it is high
time that all reticent players should
awake from their lethargy, and res
pond to the call of their alma mater.
