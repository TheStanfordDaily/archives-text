AlcGra w-Fiske, a beautiful bronze
medallion of wbom is placed over
the front doors in tbe vestibule, on
a gold mosaic background. Tbe
extreme dimensions of tbe building
ate 170 by 153 feet. It is built of
stone and tbe construction is fire
proof throughout.
Tbe general reading room, 126 by
66 feet, provides seats for two hun
dred and twenty readers, allowing
to each a desk 2 feet by 2 feet G
inches. By the arrangement of the
tables tbe readers are compelled to
sit with backs toward each other,
which does away with that hindrance
to good study caused by a general
view. Tbat a sufficient supply of
light is provided is evident from the
fact that the floor area of the room
being GGI2 scj. ft., the glass area is
1025 sq. ft. The floor of this room
is covered with corticine, which is
almost as noiseless as carpet and is
much more cleanly. All the wood
work and furniture of tbe principal
rooms is of quartered oak highly
polished.
The building contains seven sem
inary rooms, richly furnished, each
containing select collections of
books for the use of the advanced
students.
The quarters of tbe Andrew I).
White historical library are the
most attractive rooms in the build
ing This library occupies a room
on the secoud floor which is 66 by
23 feet, and extends through two
stories into the roof. The books
are arranged on the alcove system,
and in each of the twslve wide al
coves is placed a small study table
for the use of readers. Direct and
easy access is given from this room
to the general reading room and his
torical seminary rooms. It has a
book capacity of 40,000 volumes.
Tbe periodical rooms are also ar
ranged in tbe most artistic manner,
special attention being paid to tbe
convenience and light of the readers.
The building will provide storage
for at least 475,000 volumes, or
nearly four times the present extent
of the library.
