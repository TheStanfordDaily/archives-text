Miss Nettie E. Wickham euter
taiued a large audience in the chapel
last evening by reading selections
from Browning. Tbe iirst was "My
Lost Ducliess," whicli was followed
by "Up in a Villa and Down in a
City." Both were dramatically ren
dered. "The Flight of the Duchess"
was read with truly great expression.
Miss Wickham has perfect control
over her deep, rich voice, and has a
pleasiug manner of reciting. She
displayed great power in the por
trayal of "The Gypsy." The last se
lection given was "Andrea del
Sarto." The pathos of the piece was
intensified by the delivery. Miss
Wickham has a striking counte
nance, and her facial expression is
particularly impressive.
