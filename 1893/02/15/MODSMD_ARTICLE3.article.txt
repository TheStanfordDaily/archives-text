# Stanford-U.C. Ball.
## 
### 
'I he San Francisco papers have
slated recently that the idea of hav
ing a Stant'ord-U. C. ball had been
started at Berkeley. Stanford stu
dents have been waiting for some
official announcement from the
sister institution, audit cauie yester
day in the form of a letter from Ed
Mays to a student, stating what had
been proposed and asking him to
agitate the question.
The project is to have an inter
collegiate ball in Sail Francisco as
soon after Lent as possible. The
affair is to be full dress, with splen
did music and a grand supper. The
idea is a good one, and we suggest
that Mr. Webster, president of the
student body, appoint a committee
to canvass the university and report
what the students generally think of
the matter. Then if things are sat
isfactory, a committee can be sent
to Berkeley aud the expense to Stan
ford students could be ascertained.
The committee can report the ex
penses and general arrangements
to the student body, and if they are
satisfactory, definite plans can be
made. There is no reason why the
expense of going to San Francisco
and attending the ball thould not
be small. A ball like this with both
universities in full attendance would
make a most enjoyable social affair.
