# Football on Thanksgiving
## 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In yesterday's issue of this paper
there appeared a communication
which advocated and set forth rea
sons for the changing of the date of
theU.C. and Stanford game from
Thanksgiving to the 22d of Febru
ary, and which also suggested that
some one should give reasons why it
should not be changed.
Now, while there may be a few
reasons which, taken separately,
point with favor toward the advo
cated change, I think the preponder
ance of the arguments concerning
this question tip the scales markedly
on the Thanksgiving side. Such
idealistic thoughts as "of soft grassy
spots to light upon," and "de
liciously cool atmospheres in which
to play" may be exceedingly de
lightful to the football man while
dreaming of future trials of streugth,
but very little weight should be as
signed to them in this discussion.
Indeed, it is not the object to show
how the most can be got out of foot
ball, considered separately, but it is
the object of this discussion to show
how the most beneficial results may
be obtained from football, with due
respect and consideration for the
otler branches of athletics and the
college work in general.
It is obvious that such a change
would do away with the annual
tours of the team, which are becom
ing such a prominent feature of the
football season; that it would render
co-operation with the eastern teams
an impossibility, either for eastern
games or games on coast grounds;
that such a change would render it
an impossibility for those who have
taken part in football to take part in
baseball, on account of the nearness
of the two seasons.
We know that our best football
players lead also on the diamond,
and in order that our best athletes
may be enabled to take part in the
several events of our athletic season,
let the baseball and football seasons
be so arranged that they will be as
remote as possible from each other.
Nothing would be more gratifying
to us, as admirers of football, than
to have with us again that gentle
man, as well as distinguished coach,
who so thoroughly revolutionized
football at this university. 13ut we
must not allow the fact of his not
being able to be with us in the fall
to intlluence us in our decision upon
a point which will so materially
effect the workings of the college in
general, as it is quite probable that
Stanford will not be wantiug fora
competent coach when the time
comes for one.

It seems to me that :ia every stu
tleut is alive to the interests of foot
ball when he returns from his sum
mer vacation, the best results could
be obtained by having our football
season from the beginning of the
first semester until Thanksgiving.
There will be then plenty of time to
devote to the making up of back
work. At the beginning of the
second semester all who may have
taken part in the first semester's
sports will be freeli and ready to
take part in baseball. Finally, witli
our boating season removed to the
end of the second semester, we will
experience no conflicting interests,
but, on the other hand, most success
ful seasons in all branches of our
college athletics. M. H. K.
