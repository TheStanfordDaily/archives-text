Editor Daily Palo Alto:
A great deal baa been said about
the boys' rowing crew and the boat
house to be built, and no one is
more heartily in sympathy with the
movement than myself. I have,
however, waited in vain to hear of
any plan of utilizing the lake for tbe
advantage of the young ladies.
Rowing is a healthful recreation
of which the girls are just as fond as
tbe boye. Tbe lake is commou prop
erty, and there seems to be no rea
son why the girls should not form a
rowing club, not for intercollegiate
contests, but for pleasant exercise.
A few light skiffs and a building in
which to house them would make a
good beginning, and all told would
not cost more than a couple of hun
dred dollars.
The suggestion is made for what
it is worth, and it remains to be seen
whether Stanford will have the first
girls' rowing club. E. E. Smith.
