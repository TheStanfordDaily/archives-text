# Baths in the Gymnasium.
## 
### 
Editor Daily Palo A.lto:
We desire to call the attention of
all to our gymnasium. Statistics
recently published in the Sequoia
show that there are 387 students
taking work in physical training.
Only two departments can boast of a
larger number of attendants, and
yet this department is the most
poorly equipped of them all! Yes,
the most poorly equipped of them
all. Healthy physical development
without frequent baths is an impos
sibility. Showers are more import
ant thau any other feature of a gym
nasium. With a pair of dumb-bells
and a place to bathe, a man can put
himself in better condition than in
the finest gymnasium which pos
sesses no showers.
It is useless for those in charge of
this department to tell us that they
can not get the money for this im
provement, and then ramble off talk
ing about the handsome foot track
which is soon to be built up stairs,
and the padded room for boxing
and elegant mats for wrestling.
These latter luxuries cost money,
and a great deal of money, and if
we can not get the showers, which
cost very little, how are we ever to
get the luxuries? The fact that Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford so readily
subscribed $800 for the Boat Club
almost convinces us that never a

word has been said to them about
showers for the gymnasium. A
water pipe runs within fifty feet of
the building, the rooms are already
built, and the trilling coat of the
plumbing could not exceed $50, yet
for over a year we have vainly waited
for the time to come when we could
cool our steaming bodies iu a re
freshing shower. Surely it is not
lack of money but, what is worse,
lack of energy which causes our
grievance.
Fifty students try to dress them
selves all at the same time, with only
five chairs among them! Imagine
the task of putting on one's hose
and buttoning his shoes standing
up, which is imposed on forty-five
of them, unless they separately await
their turn at the chairs. This con
dition of affairs is most wretched,
and should be remedied without de
lay. Ten dollars would make
benches enough to accommodate the
largest classes.
During the rainy weather we had
the delightful experience of wading
from the quadrangle to the gymnas
ium in ankle deep mud. \Ve scarcely
know at whose door to lay this griev
ance, but hope the guilty party will
hear of it and build a sidewalk before
the next flood.
