# Princeton's Football Record.
## 
### 
When Princeton voted to have the
graduate restriction apply to foot
ball teams, the University of Penn
sylvania raised a great howl and
said Princeton voted thus because
she was fearful lest Pennsylvania
wrest from her her football prestige.
The comparative record of the two
teams would seem to disprove that
this was their motive. In the last
decade Princeton has scored 084
points against the Quakers, and these
ten years have afforded Pennsysvania
only 32 points. The college in New
Jersey holds a football record sec
ond only to Yale. Since 1883 they
have scored 446G points against op
ponents, and Yale is only a few hun
dred points in advance of this. In
fact, Yale and Princeton are far
above all competitors in football,
and shoukl have a large voice in any
football legislation.—Daily Cardinal.
