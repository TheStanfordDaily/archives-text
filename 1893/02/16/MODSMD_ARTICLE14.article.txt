The question of a university badge
has never been settled. Many of
the students desire some kind of an
emblem by which they may recog
nize each other and be recognized
by other university men. It would
be pleasant to have such a distinct
ive badge—for example, at the Co
lumbian Exposition, where those
who hail from the same institution
may easily know each other.
Nearly all are agreed that the most
convenient form for such an em
blem would be a university button.
Last year several very pleasing de
signs were offered before the student
body, but the trouble seemed to be
that each individual had his own pe
culiar ideas, and there was not a
willingness to compromise. This
year we are better organized and
doubtless better fitted to come to a
decision. All that is necessary is for
those who are interested in the sub
ject to do a little personal work.
Our student body meetings are
not characteiized by the interest
that should be shown in student af
fairs. There is too much of a dispo
sition to let "somebody else" attend
to our business for us The question
of a university button should be
brought before the students luain
and definitely decided one way or
the other. If we cannot agree on a
design, the least that we can do is to
make up our minds that we do not
care to adopt a button.
