We sometimes fancy we can read
character in one's style of composi
tion. This may be some one's pet
theory, but we have never heard it.
Style is certainly as distinctive as
handwriting, and more of the indi
vidual is embodied in it, for it is
much less mechanical. A good style
can be acquired only by a broad
study of the best models and obser
vation of tendencies, together with
much practice; and by practice we
do not mean imitation. An exclu
sive study of one period or of one
author makes a wiiter lop-sided and
narrow. The evils of this kind of
work are exceedingly well shown in
a prominent ?an Francisco news

paper man who Las taken for Lie
models Swift, Uyrou, ami other
eighteenth century writers of their
character. He has Swift's coarse
ness and Byion's coarseness, with
out the formei's wit or the lutter's
delicacy. It is as much a mistake
to copy such authors in this day as
it would be fora short story writer
to take Scott fora model. One must
adapt himself to the period in
which he writs s.
We cannot be great writers, but
we can all attain facility in the use
of English, and acquire clearness
of expression. These are things
which many university men fail to
learn, as some of cur seniors found
last year when they were required
to take the course in the Art of
Wiiting before graduation. A man
who has spent four years in any
institution empowered to grant
degrees should be a master of his
thoughts. This he cannot be said
to be unless he can commit them
to paper in such a manner as to
readily convey his meaning to the
average reader. That this is not the
case is patent to any reader of col
lege journals. Nineteenth century
ideas are often hopelessly entangled
with eighteenth century manners of
expression. It was doubtless con
siderations of this kind th.it led our
faculty to require a course in Eng
lish of all students. Though the
required course is distasteful to
many of us, we all recognize the
wisdom of its requirements.
