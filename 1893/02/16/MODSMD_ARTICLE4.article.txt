### 
Yesterday afternoon an important
meeting of the Associated Students
was held at North Ilall to receive
the report of Football Manager Brann
and act upon the report of the exec
utive committee. Prof. Edwards,
who was the member of the execu
tive committee from the faculty, and
Prof. Soule were present. Manager
Brann's report was as follows:
Net receipts, respectively, of three
Olympic games $14y.50, §189, and
$182; net receipts of the U. C.-Stan
ford game §230; total receipts for
the season 83216; total disburse

loan to the Glee Club for its tour
south last Christmas vacation, but
the money has been returned. The
expense of a training table for the
team last fall was $400. At present
there is §406 in the Berkeley Bank
of the football funds, and $833.50 in
the San Francisco Hank on deposit
to satisfy the suit brought by the
Bay City Wheelmen for the use of
