# Chinese New Year.
## 
### 
To-day is the beginning of the
Chinese Naw Year, and marks the
nineteenth year of the reign of
Quong Sui, the emperor of China.
The Chinese calendar differs from
ours in that their months are so
arranged that full moon always
occurs on the fifteenth day of each
month. Every three years, as a
consequence from this arrangement,
they have a year containing thirteen
months. It is customary with them
to celebrate the last night of the old
year with a feast, and in accordance
with that custom the May field Chi
nese held high festival last night.
The celebration proper continues for
one, two or three days, and some
times a week, according to the finan
cial condition of the community.
