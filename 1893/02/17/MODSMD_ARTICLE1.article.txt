# WHICH DATE SHALL IT BE?
## An Interesting Article Favoring February 22d as the Date for the Annual Football Game. The 						Men Should Begin Work in October So as to Have a Practice Game on Thanksgiving and Prepare for a Local Trip During Christmas Holidays.

The fact that the annual garno of
football between the two great uni
versities of the coast has attracted
such widespread attention here, and
has been favorably commented upon
by some of the leading eastern peri
odicals, should be a source of great
satisfaction to all lovers of manly
sport, and to all interested in the
right development of intercollegiate
athletics.
To obtain a place on our varsity
team is one of the honors of the col
lege course, for it is generally recog
nized that the same kind of mental
ability is required for success in the
classroom and on the fcotball field.
For the continued success of the
game the opposing teams must be
chosen from the best students in the
institution that the team represents
That this may be possible, the choice
of a date for the annual game should
be given the most careful considera
tion. The hardest practice should
come at a time when the player's
work as a student is least likely to
be affected by it.
At present no precedent has been
established. All agree that the date
for this year was undesirable. The
date for next year should, if pos
sible, remain unchanged hereafter.
On the arrival of the coaches from
the east this year, over a week after
the clo.'e of the season in the east,
the teams were found to be in only
fair physical condition. The lack of
adequate preparatory training was
apparent to everyone. Footbill,
more than any other game, calls for
hard, continuous individual playing
throughout, a kind of exertion that
can only be made in cool weather,
by gradually bringing the physical
system up to the required condition,
a process requiring time and train
ing. Most cf the accidents incident
to the game can nearly always be
traced to insufficient physical train
ing before beginning hard practice.
One scarcely hears of a member of
the Yale team being carried from the
field. The condition of the ground

iu this climate is another source of
danger to the player beginning the
game.
These facts should lead one to the
careful consideration of the ad
vantages of some other than
Thanksgiving, before definitely de-'
ciding the date of tLe next annual
game. That the interest in football
in the east centers around that date
is true, but is hardly r. sufficient rea
son for adopting the same date here. :
The success of the iutercollegiate
game this year was almost entirely
due to the coaching the two teams
received from Mr. Camp and Mr.;
McClung. Early in the season Mr.
Camp replied to a letter asking him
to recommend a coach, that there
was no one he knew of that was un
engaged This is likely to occur
again. If a proper date for the nest
annual game be chosen, the same
coaches might be induced to repeat
their visit of la?t year; if not, compe
tent substitutes could easily be pro
cured.
Some date long enough after the
holidays to allow for proper training
would have many advantages. The
men could begin work in October,
running regularly, practicing kick
ing, and working in the gymnasium.
Practice games could be arranged
for Thanksgiving and a team could
be organized fora local trip during
the Christmas holidays. Immedi
ately after the return from the holi
day trip, hard training could com
mence under the supervision of a
competent coach. Six weeks would
be about as much as i3 given in the
east. February 22d being a holi
day would, without doubt, be the
best available date.
Any date between Thanksgiving
and Christmas is out of question.
The choice then seems to lie between
Thanksgiving and Washington's
Birthday. From a disinterested
point of view, the arguments in favor
of the latter date seem to be many.
