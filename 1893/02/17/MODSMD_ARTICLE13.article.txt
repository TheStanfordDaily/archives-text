Some of us are deeply interested
in studying the inner history of the
complications in which our country
has been involved with other nationß.
A hundred years hence our success
ors will be just as deeply interested
in discussing the inside facts of a
bit of history happening at the pres
ent time. The manipulations of the
Washington people to secure the
annexation of the "green little is
land? ' in the South Sea are shrouded
in mystery. The movement fur
nishes a good illustration of the
maxim of Edwin A.. Freeman that,
•'History is pnst politics, and poli
tics present history." Some clever
caitoonist might well represent Uncle
Snm grasping for Hawaii, Canada

and Mexico, uml with tbe mot'.o of
Mon'e Christo, "Tbe world ig mine."
