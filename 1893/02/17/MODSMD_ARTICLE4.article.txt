# Hare and Hounds.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Yesterday evening, at one of the
dinner tables of Enciua, several of
the students of an athletic turn of
mind were bemoaning the lack of
interest in athletics in general and
running in particular. Various
measures were discussed as to what
would be the best way to arouse en
thusiasm among the students. Pre
liminary field daya were proposed
ad infinitum but we>e voted down.
Finally it was agreed that "hare and
hounds" would be just the thing to
arouse the spirit of anyone who had
the least spark of athletic feeling.
This idea seemed a good one and
was at once discussed.
In England the larger universities
have an annual "hare and hounds"
chase in which many of the students
take part. Intense feeling is
aroused and there is great rivalry
to see who will be the first to finish
after the "hares." It is esteemed
quite an honor to finish close to the
â€¢'harts" and the winner is regarded
with great pride by his fellow col
lege men In this manner the uni
versities many of their crack
runners.
Could we not inaugurate this cus
tom here? Certainly the results of
such sports would be beneficial to
our athletes who intend to represent
the University in our coming field
days.
Not one of the students knows
what he can do until he has tried.
Can a better opportunity offer itself
than one of these runs?
The advantages which tend to
| secure the success of such a game
are many. Among the principal
ones ore: our excellent and mild
climate, good roads, smooth hills
and a number of valleys and ravines
where the trail could be followed
satisfactorily.
Some Saturday in the near future
should be determined upon. Then
the sslection should be made of two
hares, who should be strong run
ners and capable of traveling over
considerable ground.
This run can be made a difficult
or easy chase as the participants de
cide. A short chase after the hares
around Adelante Villa or the trot
ting farm and return would not be
i n
too far for the first effort.
We have many studer.ts who
would be eager to engage in such
sport and only await a leader to
work up the matter. With ten
weeks' training, the hares would be
able to lead the hounds a merry
| chase over the hills. It behooves
all who intend to participate, to look
to their training a little, as such a

run would be likely to be tiling to
an untraiued runner. I would like
to bear from someone else on this
subject through the columns of our
paper and see what the general opin
ion is on such a proposed athletic
meet. Weser.
