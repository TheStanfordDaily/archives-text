### 
Though some colleges do not ap
prove of a course in journalism, the
University of Chicago has decided to
make a venture in this liue. A
writer in University X' j irs explains
the plan as follows:
Critical comparative essays will be
called for from members of the class
on the subject of the differences be
tween journals, their respective
points of relative superiority or infe
riority, their respective tones and
standardsâ€”tl; is, as among the repre
sentatives of the American daily and
weekly press, alike the political, the
literary, the religious (the same as
among the representatives of the
British press); and. then, besides, es
says bringing into critical compari
son the journalism of the United
States considered as a whole, and
that of Great Britain, wiih some no
tice also introduced of the French
newspaper and the German.
