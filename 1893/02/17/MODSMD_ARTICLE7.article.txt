# A 						Spanish Conversational Class.
## 
### 
Mr. Duque, instructor in Spanish,
has organized a conversational class
in that language. The first of the
regular Friday afternoon meetings
was held to-day at 2 o'clock with
about twenty members present. No
credit will be given for this work,
which is optional on the part of the
student.
