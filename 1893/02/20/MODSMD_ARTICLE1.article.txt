## The
						Varsity Team Plays its First Game and Loses. 
### 
The Varsity baseball team ma<le its
debut Saturday afternoon before one
of the smallest crowds ever gathered
on the home grounds to witness an
athletic event. dimply a practice
game having been announced caused
many to stay away; yet the enthusi
asm was as great as the playing war
ranted. The first few blunders were
overlooked by the crowd, but as the
errors accumulated, the disgust of
the spectators was evidenced by the
array of vacant seats at the end of
the fifth inning.
The best exhibition of ball playing
was given by Lewis in the prelimi
nary practice. The listless, half
dead manner in which every man on
the team except Walton, Lewis, and
Sheehan played was enough in itself
to make any team lose, and the
spirit shown by these three men is to
be commended.
McLaine, Russell, Downing, and
McKay did some very creditable
work for the second nine. Campbell
pitched a poor game the first four in
nings, but played good ball the rest
of the game. Walton did not put
up the brilliant ball he usually plays.
llis lack of practice with "south
paw" Campbell probably accounts
for it, but the poor playing of the
whole team was enough to dishearten
any captain.
The Varsity players evidently ex
pected a "snap" in the second nine,
and would put no life or "ginger"
into their play. It is very evident
that the best medicine for that kind
of work is to have more candidates
for the team. Let no one think for
a moment that any man on the team
is a fixture. If there were several
men trying for every position, so
that the places would be assigned
according to the merits of the men,
there would be a sudden stop to any
such acts of carelessness and laziness
as characterized last Saturday's game
from beginning to end.
The following is the score of thf

A crack team this year is the only j
thing that will give the students en- J
thusiasm to turn out in crowds at
home games, and is the ouly thing ,
that will give the baseball manage
ment a chauce of returning the
money which is being constantly
drawn from the football coffers.
Our boys will meet a good team
next Wednesday, and it is sincerely
to be hoped that a large crowd will
turn out to cheer them on to victory.
