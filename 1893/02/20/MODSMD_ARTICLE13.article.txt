Tbe large falling ofl' in attendance
at the meetings of the various stu
dent organizations of the University
has brought some of the societies to
a point at which they must be infused
with new spirit, or given up entirely.
What is the reason of this? Stu
dents cannot be forced to attend
these meetings, and they do not
attend them for the simple reason
that tbere is nothing at tLe meetings
to arouse their interest. They have
theory pumped into them all week,
and after Friday's recitations are
over, do not care to spend their
evening in listening to a theoretical
paper, often read by a student who
has had no experience in the matter
of which he speaks, he having ob
tained most of his information by
reading. It often h: ppens that this
reading is all on one side of the sub
ject, and therefore the speaker is
not able to handle the matter in
such a way'as to convince his audi
ence about what he ruav have con
vinced himself.
It seems that outside influences
might advantageously be introduced
into some of the societies. If men
experienced iu the different branch s
which the students aie studying
were induced to come here and re

lute tbeir experiences from the time
they left college till they obtained
their piesent positions, of the things
which were u.o3t useful to them,
and those which would have been
useful had they secured their know
ledge of them earlier, they would
arouse the enthusiasm of the stu
dents, and would not find empty
seats to talk to
The Tuesday evening lectures are
a proof of this. If tbe speakers at
these lectures should talk theory,
how many would turn out to listen
to them? Now the chapel is always
crowded to its fullest capacity. Let
us see a change in the method of
the meetings, and the change in
attendance will naturally follow.
