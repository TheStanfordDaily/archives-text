The sermon given in the chapel
Sunday morning by Rev. J. Q 1
Adams of San Francisco was par
ticularly fine The subject was ' The
Transformation of the Christian "
lie said he thought that the script
ures were too often misunderstood.
One ought to recognize the fact that |
they are strictly personal—an exhorta
tion which we are to heed. Life is
not a grand holiday; one must look
to its responsibilities. To turn from
them is a crime against humanity
and a sin against God. Here and
now we are to find blessedness in
right living. Nothing else will fol
low in the hereafter.
A faith worth having must be i
fought for, and a life worth living
one must strive for. It must come
out of fire and conflict. There must
be some eternal necessity in suffer
ing, end youth should not be heed
less of this fact. The best should
be made of time and opportunity.
We are all on a journey, and are de
termining what its destination is to
be here and now, in spits of the un
certainty of the future.
