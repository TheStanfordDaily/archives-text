At the meeting of Congress Sat
urday evening, the Gale bill, for the
abolition of capital punishment, was
considered. The debate was lively
and several good speeches were
made on both sides. Mr. Gale
made a strong appeal in favor of his
bill and was ably seconded by B. D.
Wigle and others. Messrs. Hidden
and G. G. Wigle led the opposition
and made vigorous arguments
against the bill. It was finally lost
by a close vote.
Several ladies were present and
took an active part, Miss Farns
worth and Miss Hill making some
especially interesting and pointed
remarks on the question under dis
cussion. Next Saturday evening
the Neidig bill for the admission of
Utah will be brought up.
