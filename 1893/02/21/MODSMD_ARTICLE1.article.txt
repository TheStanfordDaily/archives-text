At a meeting of the Advisory Com

inst., it was voted to bring the fol
lowing matters before the Board of
Athletic Directors for consideration.
First. An investigation of the game
of football at San Jose on Jan. 2d â€”
more especially to determine the
present amateur standing of the stu
dents participating in that game.
Second. A determination of the
conditions under which an athletic
team of university students can as
sume the University name.
Third Legislation to prevent any
member of a Stanford athletic team
from representing any other organi
zation in athletic events, together
with tho assigning of a time limit to
intervene between leaving an outside
organization and membership in a
Stanford team. "Team" here is
taken to include the competition in
actual events in track athletics.

Acting upon these suggestions the
following motions were carried:
Ist. That all the men who partici
pated in the San Jose game on Jan

athletic treasury immediately.

sume the University name unless so
authorized by the committee in
