There is a good deal of discussion
as io where the farce should be
given, whether in the chapel or in
Eucina gymnasium. We all remem
ber the l«rge house that greeted ''The
First Year at Palo Alto," when that
original farce was played in the
chapel last year, and this ytar we
look fora still larger crowd—a
crowd that the chapel will not be
able to hold comfortably.
The chapel has seats already ar
ranged. It is just a little more con
venient to Kobie and to the walks
from the rows. But the gymnasium is
large enough for the crowd; is more
airy, a thing to be considered by a
large audience on these warm even
ings; is not likely to be injured by a
temporary stnge, which must be
constructed for either place; is the
only place where the band could
play an overture with any efl'ect;
and is a more appropriate place for
a theatrical entertainment. But
there aie some obstacles in the way
of securing the gymnasium. Several
hundred recitation room chairs must
be moved from the quad, to the
gymnasium on the nfternoon of the
farce, and all gymnasium work must

he tuspended ou that afternoon.
Still the advantages of the gymna
sium are sufficiently great to inure
a decision in favor of it from those
who have control of the matter.
Some consideration should be given
the students who will take part in
the entertainment. Every one of
them, together with the members of
the baud and of the stringed orches
tra, who will a'so tuke part, is, we
understand, in favor of the gym
nasium.
