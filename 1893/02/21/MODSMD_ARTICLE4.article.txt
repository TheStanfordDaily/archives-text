To the Daily Palo Alto:
An article which appeared in a
late issue of the Daily Palo Alto
with reference to the need of show
ers in the gymnasium, is hut one of
the many of similar character that
have appeared from time to time and
is a crying shame to the public sen
timent of our University. There
seems to be a growing feeling that
the one who does the most "luck
ing" is the best man. If only a
little of this process in its original
signification could be applied to
these same fault-finders, it would
certainly have a salutary eli'ect.
By the writer's own statement, the
I cost of putting in the showers is but.
$50. Were it $5000, or even $500,
it would be apparent that the stud
ents could not think of the expense.
But fora paltry $.">O.OO it seems ab
surd, to call it by no harsher term,
to make such an outcry or in any
way make any further demand upon
the purses of those who have given
and given until now we are so
spoiled that we think that all we
have to do is to cry out our wants
aloud and they will be immediately
satisfied.
"It is a mean heart that will take
all that a generous spirit will give."
Let us brace up and share part of
the burden ourselves. There are
357 students enrolled in this depart
ment, the author still further states.
By a contribution of twenty-Jive cents
merely, there would aggregate nearly
] 8100, enough for the showers and
benches, and there would still be
some to spare.
Let us create a college spirit that
will frown on the everlasting croaker
| and that will inspire every one with
a willingness to do for himself and
others. That no one may have a
| chance to say, "You'se is always a
talkin' and a talkin', but aint never
a doin' nuflin," I would like to be
the first "to follow mine own teach
ing," and therefore gladly enclose
my contribution to this shower fund.
If iL should meet with the ap
proval of the editor, he might open
a subscription column in the paper,
and announce the receipts by name
or initials day by day. In this way
we can then see two things: first,
just how eager the students are
to show their loyalty to the institu
tion, and second, how quickly the
required amount can be raised.
