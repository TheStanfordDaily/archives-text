# Hare and Hounds.
## 
### 
All those who would like to take a
short run over the hills to-morrow
morning will please be at the back
door of the east end of Encina at 11
a.m. Three runners will act as hares
and will lead a short run, probably
around the lake and back; in all the
run will be about two aud oue-half
miles.
Those who intend to train this
year will find it to their advantage to
take part in the chase. The hares
will be allowed ten or fiften minutes
start, and will carry torn-up paper
for "scent." These runs will prob
ably occur twice a week after this,
and it is desired tbat as many as pos
sible meet to take part. The run
will be made an easv one.
