We call attention in tbis issue to
another communication concerning
tlie condition of the Encina gymna
sium. We received three others on
the same subject to-day, but as they
were principally of the "kicker"
type they were not published.
This communication suggests a fair
and practical way of securing the
showers in the gymnasium, and cer
tainly if the desire for them is as
great as the numerous complaints
imply, we have 110 doubt the twenty
live cent subscription will be forth
coming at once from every student
who takes gymnasium work.
We shall gladly publish the names
of the subscribers as suggested, if
the}' so desire, but for our own con
venience and for the convenience of
the subscribers themselves, we sug
gest that a subscription list be
opened in Mr. .Black's office in the
Encina gymnasium.
