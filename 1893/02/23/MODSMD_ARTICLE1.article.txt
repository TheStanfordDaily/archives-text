# STANFORD WINS.
## The
						Reliance Team Defeated by a Score of 6 to 1. 
### 
The college baseball season was
formally opened yesterday after
noon by a game on the Lome
grounds between the Reliance Club
of Oakland and the Varsity team;
the latter winning handily by ascoro
of 6 to 1.
The game was hard fought from
start to finish and up to the sixth
inning neither side had much ad
vantage; but then tho superior work
of our boys began to tell and they
forged ahead aud kept the lead to
the end. It can be truthfully said
that the Reliance team was out
played in every particular. Our
boys did heavier batting, made fewer
errors and ran bases much more
skillfully than their opponents, and
fully redeemed themselves for their
defeat last year. It will be remem
bered that the Reliance Club de
feated the Varsity team last April by
a score of 12 to G
Campbell did great work in the
box, striking out thirteen men, and
allowing only three hits off his de
livery. He was especially steady at
critical times when men were on
bases. Walton gave him magnifi
cent support, and it was largely due
to his e ffts that the game was won.
His throwing to bases was wonder
fully accurate. If our battery men
keep to the standard they set in yes
err ay's game, we can look forward
to a great record for our team this
season.
The most brilliant feature of the
whole game was the phenomenal
running catch by llarrelson, in the
second inning, of Clipper's high fly
near the foul line. The catch well
merited the applause it received.
Lewis and Davy did some good in
field work, the latter making a fine
stop of a grounder in thefirst inning.
For the Reliance team, Mulvey
pitched a fair game, but received
poor support, both behind the bat
and in the field. J. Artlett aud
Crowley did the best work for the
infield, and Watson distinguished
himself in the outfield by making
two difficult catches. Crowley,
Clipper, and Ewing were the only
ones on the team who were not cred
ited with errors. Evidently the men
were out of practice.
The batting was very light on both
sides. Many of the men seemed
sadly in need of a "batting eye."
It is hoped that our team will learn
to hit the ball hard. There is noth
ing more interesting to the specta
tators, and nothing that will win so
many games.

A large crowd was in attendance,
many visitors being present from
San Francisco, San Jose and other
placel An enthusiastic delegation
from Oakland was present to cheer
on the Reliance team, but all their
efforts were in vain. Thanks to
Manager Grove, seats enough for
nearly all the spectators had been
provided and it was possible to wit
ness the game in comfort. The only
source of annoyance was the con
tinual driving of carriages and buses
within the foul lines, thus interfer
ing greatly with the work of the
fielders. Some way should be found
to put a stop to this practice-
