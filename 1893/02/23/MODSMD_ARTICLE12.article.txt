The work on our boat Lome is be
ing pushed forward very rapidly.
With the advantages soon to be of
fered, boatiug promises to be one of
the very best diversions from the
routine work of the busy student.
Many cannot play football, and oth
ers do not fiud it their forte to play
baseball, but certainly all can find
more or le√üs enjoyment and also
healthful exercise iu rowing. There
will be five or six pleasure boats in
the house when completed, but these
cannot possibly supply the demand.
In order to facilitate matters it
would be wise for several clubs to
have their own boats. It would bs
very convenient and comparatively
inexpensive. We understand that
all members of the boating organizi
tion can have the privilege of the
house free. This should induce all
who feel the least interested in this
excellent sport to bccome members
at once. That the treasurer may be
able to meet all demands as soon as
the houso is completed, let every
member hand in his fee as soon as
possible.
