In the Carmina Collcycntia, edited
by Henry Randall Waite, is a collec
tion of the songs of the American
colleges, with selections from the
student songs of the English and
German universities. Should we
not have several songs that breathe
the spirit of the Stanford University?
Each college has a peculiar life that

should be embodied in its songs,
which should live l.>ng after text
books are forgotten. Besides the
happy remembrance of these songs,
there are many times when they are
almost in dispensable; especially
when events of great importance
take place, such as our intercollegi
ate games
If another excursion is given on
Founders' Day, as there should be
by all means, it will add much to
the occasion to have a number of
college songs well practiced ami well
known to all students, so that the
singing will be a feature of the occa
sion. Good music has an elevating
tendency. Though perhaps over
drawn, yet there is some truth in
the statement, "Let me write the
songs of the country, I care not who
makes the laws." It is really nec
essary that the fiiends of the Uni
versity lend assistance by writing
some interesting and enlivening
songs, and thus not only add enjoy
ment as well as profit to our college
life, but make it possible that
L. S. Jr. U. may be represented in
the next edition of the Ccirmina
Collegensw.
