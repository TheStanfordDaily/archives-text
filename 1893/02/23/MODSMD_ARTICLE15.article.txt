The San Jose Mercury says this
morning:
The charity concert given at the
Fin»t M E Church last evening by
the Leland Stanford Jr. University
Mandolin Orchestra and Glee Club,
and under the management of the
ladies who have 60 often labored for
the benefit of the conservatory of
music at the Universi y of the Paci
fic, was enjoyed by a fair-sized audi
ence. Both the Mandolin Club and
Glee Club have been practicing
regularly since the opening of .the
school year, and in their entertain
ment last evening they made a most
praiseworthy showing. Messrs. Ken
nedy and Baker are well known to
the college communities as solo
singers, and in that circle have been
frequently received with much en
thusiasm. There was no attempt
made toward rendering what is
termed classical music, but such as
is commonly presented by the simi
lar organizations of the old colleges
in t u ie east. Each number was heart
ily applauded.
