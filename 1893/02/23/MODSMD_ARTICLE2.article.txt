# Fatal Accident at Palo Alto.
## 
### 
Yesterday forenoon's north-bound
flyer was behind time as it dashed
past Pa'o Alto at a little over fifty
five miles an hour. The regular pas
senger train from the city was side
tracked to let the flyer pass, when
Louis Adams, one of Yesle's bus
drivers, attempted to spring across
the main track in response to the
warning cry of a small boy who was
holding the man's team, and who
feared there would be a runaway.
The unfortunate young fellow
from his position partly behind the
standing train could not see how
dangerously near the approaching
flyer was when he made the fatal
spring. He was struck by the cow
catcher and thrown as high as the
neighboring telegraph poles and
over fifty feet in advance and a little
to one side of the engine. Jlis shoes
were completely torn off without
even scratching his feet, his body
was badly mangled, and his skull
fractured. Louis Adams was about
twenty years of age, and his home
was in San Francisco.
