### 
The members of Phi Delta Theta
entertained quite a number of
friends at their home, Lauro Hall,
last evening. Dancing, cards, and
kindred amusements filled up an
evening of enjoyment. In order
that the memory of George Wash
ington should not be neglected,
little souvenir boxes of candied cber
rffes daintily tied with the fraternity
colors, blue and white, were carried
irotTie by those in attendance. Light
refreshments were served.
