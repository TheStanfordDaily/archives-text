# Hare and Hounds.
## 
### 
Yesterday morning the athletic
enthusiasts took their first ruu in
"hare and hounds." A pleasant
and warm day served to biing out
quite a number of runners, and
much interest was aroused as to who
would be first to finish after the
hares. Knowles, '%, proved to be
the "dark horse" in the race and
finished first, with Brown and Fry a
short distance behind. A little
breeze scattered the scent and in
some places it was difficult to follow.
The course, which was only a short
one of about four miles, was from
Encina through the"camp," around
Rob'.e, the museum, mausoleum,
and through the arboretum. Too
much time was allowed the hares,
but such matters can easily be rem
edied. Mayuard, Donahoo and
Stuart were the hares in this chase,
and succeeded in beating the hounds
in less than their time handicap.
Isext Saturday Dave Brown and Fry
will act as hares, and it is desired
that a larger number turn out to run
than yesterday, although the num
ber of participants was quite a sur
prise. About twenty-five took part
iu this chase. May there be forty
or fifty ready to run next Saturday
morning at 10:30 a.m., from the
front of Encina.
