# Quackery
## 
### 
The usual Tuesday evening lec
ture was given by Dr. J. 11. Stallard
of Menlo Park. His subject was
"Quackery."
The most abject scepticism iaoftea
the birth of credulity. All quack

cry is founded upon desire. The
more one desires, the more willing
is he to believe in that which may
sati&fy his desire. The science of
medicine is uncertain. Food given
in health may be fatal iu disease.
Very many diseases follow a natural
course, and it is easy to confound
natural recovery with the effect of
medicines. Confidence helps to
bring about a desired result. It is
hard to distinguish the physician
from the quack. When a man as
serts that he has been cured of such
a disease by such a remedy, he often
commits unintentional perjury.
The instinct of man is to desire a
sure cure of his disease. The quack
always promises this. In France
the belief in quackery has existed
for over a thousand years; io Eng
land for seven hundred years. The
kings were supposed to have the
power of healing all* diseases by
merely touching the afflicted. The
newspapers of to-day are full of
feats of quacks. Some few are sin
cere in their work. The science of
medicine owes much to quacks in
the discovery of new remedies and
new modes of treatment. Quackeiy
is always addressed to the ignorant
multitude, the most easily abused
and most diffiultly disabused.
