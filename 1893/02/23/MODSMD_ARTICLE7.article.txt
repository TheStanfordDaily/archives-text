# Belmont Notes.
## 
### 
For the first time in its history
Belmont School has an organized
eleven. The fellows have been prac
ticing since January, and hope soon
to play a match game. A good deal
of thanks is owed Mr. Lion of Stan
ford for his kind assistance in coach
ing the players.
On Friday last the first and second
elevens played a practice game,
which was umpired by Mr. White
house of Stanford. Yesterday the
first eleven again met the second
team, which was composed of fifteen
men, and defeated it, the score be
ing 12 to 0.
Three or four challenges have
been sent to elevens in San Fran
cisco, but so far they have not been
heeded. In reply to a challenge
sent tbe Boys' iliyh School of San
Francisco their team asks if a game
cannot be arranged with the Bel
mont second eleven. The latter
team has received a challenge from
the Deltas of San Francisco, and
will accept it. 1
By the end of the week the car
penters will be through work on the
new gymnasium, which will be ready
for occupancy very soon after. It is
a fine, substantial building and is a
credit to Belmont.
