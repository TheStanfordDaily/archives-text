						Manager Gives a Detailed Account of the Finances of the Co-operative Association. 
### 
To tbe Board of Directors of the Le
land Stanford, Jr. University
Co-operative Association:
Herewith is a statement of the fi
r.ancial standing of the association at
present:
We have on hand $2232.07 worth
of merchandise aud cash, $536.70,
or $2768.77, resources which are
theoretically usible. We owe
$1951.51, which leaves a balance of
8517.26. Of the stock of goods on
hand the value of books is $1688.75;
value of stationery, 8513.32; total,
$2232.07.
Books on band: English, $775.70
(Euglish nearly half of whole
amount); Mathematics, Physics, and
Astronomy, $403.60; History, $111.-
44; Philosophy, 836 47; German,
$52.53; Greek, $44.61; Latin, $32.06;
Spanish and Italian, $14.06; French,
$50.02; Miscellaneous, $16 22; Chem
istry, $21.40; Biology, 525.06; Soci
ology, $111 67.

Now I desire this board to under
stand ami know lio\v this stock ac>
cumulates; therefore I have stated
the valuation cf the books iu each
department, and will state the
method of ordering.
Ordering, when most of it is done
in vacation, is necessarily largely
guess work, because classes are un

formed, and tbe average professor is
timid about overestimating bis pop
ularity or that of his subject; for ex
ample, Prof. Newcomer ordered
twenty copies of Logic, aud
I think that eighty copies, or
more, were used. Of course
this makes much trouble for some,
but who can fairly be blamed?
Surely not Prof. Newcomer for not
guessing correctly, neither the gen
erous Senator Stanford and wife for
founding the L. S. Jr. U. so far from
the book market, New York. Books
have often to be ordered after classes
aie formed and we just have to wait
until they arrive. "Fate rules tbe
earth," and instances have not beeu
wanting where publishers have been
out of books, which occasioned fur
ther delay. This explanation ought
to, but does not, satisfy kickers. A
professional kicker, like a well-known
government animal, will kick for the
fun of kicking.
Now as to prices: I have tried to
sell as cheaply as possible, and work
carefully in the interest of the Asso
ciation.
The Association interest is not the
interest oj each member, but the com-

positc interest of all, which I have
endeavored to conserve.
First, in complaining about prices,
the habit is to compare co-op. prices
with eastern prices. "Why not com
pare them with local prices? Most
books have to be ordered sent by
express, the cost of which is so
heavy from New York here as to

just about cancel our discount. Our ;
only gain in buying from publishers
instead of jobbers is in the fact that
the bojks are handled and charged
for transportation but once, where if
bought from the jobber we have to ;
pay for the extra handling and
transportation. The jobbers, aside
from the point just mentioned, give
us as good discounts as the pub
lishers.
Now the question naturally arises,
how is this? Why is it so? Simply
this, the publishers have to protect
the jobbers, because the jobbers are
the servants of the publishers. In
other words, their footmen. They
do work for the publishers that the
Co-ops cannot do. Therefore where
the jobbers get one third discount,
we get but one sixth, and so on.
This is fact, and fact interprets fact.
This shows that the Co-op is largely
a convenience—not a perfect con
venience, for the millennium is not
yet—but convenience plus no small
mixture of saving makes the mater
ial for its corner stone. The Co-op
is only a number of individuals
banded together fora certain end,
viz: the procuring of supplies read
ily and cheaply. The end, on the
whole, has without doubt been
achieved, but on the contrary, there
have been individual cases where
this was not attained, not because of
any enmity toward the individual,
but on account of the circumstances
of the case and the protection of the
Association. Some one saw fit some
time back to write an anonymous
grumbling communication in the
Daily Palo Alto, showing an entire
lack of knowledge of the Co-op, its
constitution and its management.
If you have criticism, be manly
enough to put your signature under
it. On the evening of February 15
the board of directors heard and
adopted the report of the man
ager, by that act endorsing
the management and condemn
ing the underhanded insinuat
ing criticism of the "kickers."
Objections were offered to man
agement in various ways and were
as a rule satisfactorily met. They
might be cited litre and explained,
but space forbids. The directors
are the direct representatives of
members of the association, and they
doubtless will be glad to explain
anything within their power if they
are requested to do so.
Very respectfully,
E. L. Rrcn, Mauager of Co-op.
