The chief aim in iouudiug this
University was :o give students an
opportunity to obtain a practical
education. In many—in most —res-
pects this idea h.is, so far, been con
stantly borne in mind by the faculty.
Yet it seems that some important
branches have not received an atten
tion in proportion to their popular
ity. For instance, all the firsl year
classes in ancient languages, and all
those in European languages except
Spanish, have t five recitations a week.
Spanish is to mauy students, and
particularly to those who live on the
Pacific slope, of an equal if not of a
more practical advautage than either
French or German. Why is it then
that the c'ass in elementary Spanish
meets only twice a week?
Any announcement made in the
1893-94 Register to the eflect tluiUle
mentary Spanish will be made a five
hour course will enable many stud
ents to ariange for themselves a less
diversified plan of study than is nec
essary when theie are many popular
but few hour courses. We express,
we believe, the wish of quite a Lum
ber of students in the University
when we suggest this chnnge.

Yesterday for tlie first time re
served seats for an entertainment in
the chapel were put on tale. Some
thing ought to be well learhed from
tlie fxperience of the day that will
be of use in the futuie: uud that
something is, that no one person
should be allowed the privilege of
buying up a great number of the
best seats in the house, to the ex
clusion of others immediately be
hind him. The persons who did j
it yesterday undoubtedly thought
they were accommodating friends and ,
did not see how selfish their pro
ceeding really was. Iu the future,
no one person should be allowed the
privilege of securing more than a
very limited number of seats, say
two or four. Thus there will be
some significance to the statement,
"first come, first served," and equal
justice will be done to all. This
matter is brought up principally be
cause our seating accommodation
here for entertainments is very
small and there is bound to be
enough disappointed ones without
aggravating matters. Also becauae
in future years, the years of orator
ical contests, etc , it will be well to
have a precedent clearly established
in order to preclude the system of
"cornering," so detestable a pro
ceeding in some of our ea&tern uni
versities. Let our lesson be well
learned and let us in the future,
compel each one to be considerate
of his next door neighbor iti line,
who had the misfortune to arrive at
the office possibly two seconds later
than himself.
