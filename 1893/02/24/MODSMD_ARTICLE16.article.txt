# Editors Receive Credit.
## 
### 
At the regular weekly meeting of
tbe faculty it was decided on rec- j
ommendation of the committee, who
had been appointed to report upon j
the resolutions sent the faculty some
tiftie ago by tbe Cardinal association, j
to grant the editor-in-chief of tbe
Daily Cardinal credit fora full
study during tbe time of bis work |
upon the paper with the following;
limitation?: that such credit should j
not be given for more than one
term's work. The other editors of
tbe staff will receive credit for the
work actively done by them. This
will be submitted to the bead of the
department of rhetoric at the end of
the term and credit will be granted
by him to tbe respective editors in
proportion to tbe amount and qual
ity of the work done. The aim of
this is to create some good reason
for faithful work on the part of the
Cardinal editors. It is a formal re
cognition of tbe value and import
ance of such work in tbe college
The editor-in-chief's work was found
so varied and comp'ex that no ade-1
quate means of estimating it could ;
be reached by mere submission of;
bis writing, and, as it is necessarily
more work than required by any full j
study in the university, it was j
thought safe to grant a fu l study |
credit unconditionally. â€”U. of \V. I
Cardinal.
