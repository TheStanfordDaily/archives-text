# THEATRICALS.
## The 						Original Farce "Without Rehearsal" and the Melodrama "Tulu" Given Before a Crowded House. 
### 
The theatrical on Friday night
was successful beyond expectation,
both in a financial way and in the
happy display of dramatical talent.
The chapel was crowdcd with an
enthusiastic throng when the first
notes of the overture sounded, aud
the rush for the window seats on
the outside showed that many more
people were not going to miss the
entertainment for lack of tickets.
The participants in the play made
the hit of the season, and received
many ovations from the appreciative
audience. The dramatic and hum
orous ability displayed was of the
highest order, and reflects great
credit on the performers, when the
short time of preparation is con
sidered. In fact, everything went
off smoothly, the audience being
pleased and the coffers of the Roble
reading room replenished.
Mr. Field's "Without Rehearsal,"
an original farce in one act, as a cur
tain raiser was replete with good
local hits. The scene, as laid in the
Roble green room on the night of
the lioble theatricals, displayed a
clever bit of writing, and a rare skill
in dramatical execution.
Miss Luce as Jeanne Trevelyn,
Miss Kate Ilerrick as Ruth Haven,
Mr. Chase as Ned Clayton, and Mr.
Field as Jack Pond played their
parts in an easy, natural manner,
and gave the audience a half hour's
delightful entertainment.
The second part of the program
was the farce "Tulu," in three acts.
The cast of the play was: Duchess
of Toedmeg, Miss May Keating;
Lord Blazenberrie, 0. W. Marsh;
Jack Ryder, Mr. O. S. Simmons;
Petrolia Seersucker, Miss Maud
Jones; Tulu Seersucker, Miss Grace
Davis; Dick Chetwyn, Mr. O. P.
Morton; Robinson, the butler, Mr.
Shirley Baker.
The parts were well taken, and
from the many favorable comments
the members of the farce can rest
well assured that their hard work in
preparing the play wis put to a good
purpose.
The program throughout was in
terposed with entertaining music by
the Band, Mandolin Club, Quartette,
and a beautiful violin solo by Carl
Thomas.
The young ladies of Roble are to
be congratu'ated on the success of
the occasion, for their hard work in
preparation, and for breaking the

dull monotony of the general trend
of the'entertainments at Stanford.
The farce was given again on Sat
urday evening ia order to accommo
date the large number that were
forced to miss the first night's per
formance for lack of seats. The
house was well filled, and the acting
went off even more smootnly than
on the previous evening.
