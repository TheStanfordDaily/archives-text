# 'Character Building,"
## 
### 
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper of San Fran
cisco preached Suuday. Her subject
was "Character Building." She
took her text from the writings of
St. Paul, and referred to him as a
man of strong character. She said
what we admired in such men as
Grant, Washington and Garfield
was their strong character. The
secret of greatness she said was in
doing something, for by doing we
learn, whether it is in the kinder
garten or in the highest university. '
If one does right he will naturally
judge right. She spoke of the "all
right" of the engineer, and thought
that as we were travelers to another
world, we should be sure of the "all
right" of God. In building a char
acter we must, as in all building.!
look well to the foundation and fur
nishing. Nothing grows so fast as
character, and every stroke counts;
hence we should be alert and active. >
We should catch opportunities on
the fly. Though heroic character
builders are sometimes defeated, we
should remember that in our civil
war there were many defeats on our
side, yet we finally conquered. The
demand now is for higher and better
characters and we must build ac
cordingly.
