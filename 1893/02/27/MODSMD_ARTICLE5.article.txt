Though the San Mateos were
beaten, it was not without a close
contest. They played a very scien
tific game throughout, and it would
be difficult to lincl anywhere a better
team in their class. Very seldom is
finer infield work seen here than they
exhibited. AVood and Edwards ac
cepted chance after chance in fine
style, and materially aided in keep
ing the Varsity score down so low.
A very pretty double play was
made by Ouimette and Lendrum in
the seventh inning. Ouimette caught
a long fly from White's bat, and by
a fine throw doubled Ray on first.
McLaine and Russell, our substitute
battery, played with the San Mateos,
and acquitted themselves very cred
itably against the Varsity heavy
hitters.
Campbell pitched a good steady
game, and the San Mateos could do
little against bis delivery. lie

fielded his position remnkably well,
making a great catch of Edwards'
liner in the fourth inning. "Walton
gave him his usual fine support.
Davey did the best work on the in
field, his one error being excusable
on account of the unevenness of the
ground. Pauley did not play up to
his usual standard, but this is prob
ably accountable to his recent ill
ness.
Tbe team's batting was somewhat
improved, Downing and Ray doing
some especially good stick work.
Tbe fielders had little to do, as the
heavy Meat wind prevented the ball
from going out to them The da}'
was cold aud disagreeable, and only
a few spectators remained to the end
of the game.
