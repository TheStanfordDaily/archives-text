# Hare and Hounds
## 
### 
Last Saturday morning Brown
and Fry acted as hares and led the
hounds a lively chase. The course
was around the lake, through Stan
ford's vineyard and along San Fran
cisquito creek to the Palo Alto road,
and return. About fifteen hounds
endeavored to find the flying hares,
hut were not able to do so. Fry was
forced to quit early in the chase and
Brown led the trail for the greater
part of the distance alone. The
hares were allowed five minutes start,
which was ample time for them to
get under cover. The course was
about five or five aud OLe half miles,
and was run by Brown in min
utes. Hazzud, '9G, was the first
one of the hounds to fiuish. His
time was 41 minutes. Salisbury
was a good second and has the mak
ing of a very good runner, with
practice.
There will be a short run Wednes
day afternoon at 5:10, of about two
or three miles. Clernans will take
charge of tte run. It is desired that
as many as possible take part, so
that the interest in this exhilarating
sport may not flag. By taking part
in these runs the students who are
in training for baseball, tennis, or
track athletics will be much bene
fitted .
