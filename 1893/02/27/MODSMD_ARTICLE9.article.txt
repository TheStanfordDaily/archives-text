What injures tlie students' eyef>?
Is it too much study, or is it only an
ordinary amount of study under un
favorable conditions of light and
beat? We incline to the latter opin
ion. Very few students would ruin
their eyes by too much study if they
were careful to secure a good light
in which to use them. Continued
study fora long period -with the best
light secured by ordinary precau
tions upon the reading matter would
tell upon a student's general phys
ical condition, provided he were a
continued dig and took no time for
exercise, sooner than it would upon
his eye-ight.
We are not so sure about the way
the young ladies study, but we do
know how a great majority of the
men study. In Encina scores of
students sit under the unshaded
glare of the electric lights, and with
out any eyeshades, either, while they
read with the light streaming down
into their faces' aud upon their
books. Many read hour after
hour with their heads envel
oped in a cloud of tobacco smoke;
others lie upon their backs and read
by an uncertain distant light, or by
a drop light hung somewhere near
the bed; still others waste the early
part of the evening, and have to re
sort to a flickering candle flame to
study by after the electric lights are
out.
We have often heard the wi-h ex
pressed for gas instead of electricity
in the buildings This is a mistake.
The open gas llame, which is a yel
low aud unsteady light, diminishes
the supply of oxygen in the room,
and generates an unpleasant heat
near one's head. It is the same way
with the oil lamp, which, however,
gives a whiter flame, and on account
of the position of the chimney, does
not consume so much oxygen, nor
radiate so much heat downward and
laterally.
Some time ago an item went the
rounds of the newspapers to the ef
fect that the cadets ;it West Point
were rapidly getting we.de eyes from
studying by incandescent electric

lights. The same thing might at
some time be said of tho-e living in
the large balls here. But it would
not be strictly true, an}- more than
it would be true to say a stud
ent mined bis eyes by reading in the
daylight, and tbat therefore daylight
is not the best kind of light. But
when we go further and say that the
student read with the glaring tun
rays shining directly into his face, we
see where the fault lay.
The incandescent electric light
does not consume oxygen; does not
generate a perceptible heat; does not
give forth any odor, and is the best
of all artificial ligh's But like the
sun its direct glare is too powerful.
As ? °>'idy light it should be shaded
and used with are Hector so arranged
that no rrys will come directly from
it to the eyes. The glaring effect
may be obviated by using a frosted
glass globe, or by improvising such
a globe by an application of sand
paper or a bar of soap to the plain
glass globes until they are trans
lucent.
Scores of rooms in both hails have
neither droplights nor shades and
their occupants study on oblivious
or unconscious of the injury that is
being done their eyesight. "He
ruined his eyes by hard study at col
lege" is not nearly so true a remark
jasit is frequent. Our eyes are in
tended to be used, but not to be
abused. We cannot read at dusk or
in strong cross lights or with a glare
in our faces without injuring our
eyes.
