# Joy at Cornell.
## 
### 
For the last three months the
commodore of the Cornell navy has
been corresponding with Cambridge
University in regard to an eight
oared boat race between the crews
of Cornell and Cambridge. The
correspondence has all been of a
favorable nature, but it was not un
til the dispatch stating that Cam
bridge would row Cornell at the
World's Fair, that it wa3 really im
agined that she would accept the
overtures and would row in America.
The news was enthusiastically re
ceived at Ithaca and spread like
wildfire over the campus. The navy
officials there, in the absence of
Commodore Ilagerman who is on a
short vacation, refuse to talk of the
race, stating that the commodore
had the matter in charge, and
they were really ignorant of any let
ters which he might have from Cam
bridge. They seem very much
elated over the news, however, and
would have given information had
they any to give. Everyone is wait
ing anxiously now to hear fuller
particulars.
