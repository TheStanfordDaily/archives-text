Manager Grove received a letter
yesterday from T. P. Robinson,
manager of the Oakland professional
team, asking for two games to be
played in San Francisco and Oak

month. It was decided to play on
the ISth, and if the faculty will give
the 17th, to play on that date also.
The expenses areâ€¢ guaranteed and
also a certain portion of the gate re
ceipts would go to our team. The
Oakland team was defeated by the
U. C team last Saturday by a score
of G to 5, so our boys ougnt to staud
a good chance of wiuniug a game
