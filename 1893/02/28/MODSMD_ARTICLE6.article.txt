# ADDITION TO OUR MUSEUM
## Mr. George W. Lichtenthaler, of Bloomington, III., Leaves a Substantial Bequest to the University. 
### 
Mr. Geo W. Lichtenthaler, who
died at the Russ House iu the city
recently, left his entire collection of
curiosities to our museum. Mr.
Lichtenthaler has devoted the most
of his time for the past twenty years
to a study of conchology and marine
botany. He took up the study as a
pastime, but being of a scientific
turn of mind and possessed of ample
means, what he took up as an avoca
cation became the vocation of his
later years, and he succeeded in
gathering the finest private collection
of shells, marine plants and ferns in
the world. He made many journeys
to this coast and explored almost the
entiie coast from Alaska to the
isthmus. He often visited the Sand
wich Islands, and brought therefrom
some very fine treasures. He trav
ersed Europe from North Cape to
Gibralter, and wandered up and
down both coasts of Africa, search
ing for things that would add to the
knowledge of the science iu which
he was an enthusiast. Everything
Mr. Lichtenthaler found he care
fully analyzed and classified scienti
fically, then catalogued the whole
collec ion. The specimens of sea
weed, water plants and ferns are
well mounted, and the shells will
be of great assistance in the study of
marine auimal lifo. Mr. Lichten
thaler had intended to give his col
lection to some eastern college,
probably Chicago University, but
his frequent visits to the coast caused
him to change his mind. The value
of the collection is estimated at
$25,000.
