# The 						Intercollegiate Ball.
## 
### 
The idea of having a U. C.-Stan
forcl ball has not been given up. On
the contrary, active measures are
being taken, both at Palo Alto and
at Berkeley, toward the successful
carrying out of such a scheme. Pres.
Kellogg has given his endorsement,
and it now rests with Pres. Jordan
to add his consent. The affair will
be select and the event of the year.
A limit of 150 tickets for each uni
versity will be necessary, so that it
behooves a'l those who intend to be
present to give their names as soon
as possible to the peisons who will
canvas the University within the
next few days. Mrs. -Jordan, Mrs.
Kellogg, and many prominent ladies
of San Francisco, will be asked to
act as lady patrons. It is to be
hoped that the ntlair will have a sue

cessful outcome, as it will ferve as a
strong stimulus toward arousing the
dormant condition of social life at
Palo Alto.
