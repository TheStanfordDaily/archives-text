# A 						Successful Failure.
## 
### 
The usual Tuesday evening lec
ture was given by Prof. Barnes on
*'A Successful Failure." It was the
simple story of a man who started
out in life with nothing, gained
great wealth, dreamed a dream, and
lost all he had in attempting to real
ize it. This man was Robert Owen.
In the southwestern corner of
Indiana we find a large tract of j
some 30,000 acres c 112 land in which
stands the thrifty village of New
Harmony. New Harmony was set
tled early in IS2I by Germans under
the leadership of liapp who mi
grated from France upon the failing
power of Napoleon For some
reason, this leuler wished these peas
ants to return with him to Pennsyl
vania. lie sent his agent to Eng
land to sell the land about New Har
mony. This ageut met Robert
Owen,
was born in Wales, was
educated in country schools, and
gained great wealth in cotton spin
ning. At the time he was twenty
six, the introduction of steam en
gines and cotton gins changed Eng
land from an agricultural country to a
manufacturing one. Great wealth
came to the manufacturers, and mis
ery to the operatives. Women took
the place of men in the mills, and
were themselves replaced by chil
dren. Owen, already rich, filled
with noble ideas, set about to right
these wrongs. We find two great
philosophical principles underlying
his whole life. He believed the
character of man was formed for him
and not by him, and that man
could never hope to be free until
lie was freed from the superstitions
of the church. He went to work in
Lenark, rebuilt the lnuses, closed
the saloons, and founded schools,
lie trained teachers and his schools
became the pattern for all Europe.
Philanthropists came from all the
world to study bis system of police,
clubs, etc. Owen went to London
aud preached the gospel of co-opera
tion. In urging the people to free
themselves from the church he lost
his influence in England. He then
met the agent from New Harmony.
He came to America, bought New
Harmony, and invited all to join
him. Soon a motley crowd of some
nine hundred souls gathered at the
town. Owen was ready for all. Ho
hoped for mutual helpfulness and
high education for all. He called
the people together and organized
the community which was to secure
the greatest happiness for each of
them.
Owen returned to Scotland aud
settled all his business in that coun

try, and returned to New Harmony :
with many remarkable men, and
much intellectual matter. He found
all in confusion, but soon brought
order cut of cbaos. Ho divided the
people into six groups to exccute;
the work. Great prosperity fol- j
lowed, but there was a substratum of
discontent which developed into dis
cord and ended in dissolution.!
Owen realized his failure, sold his
lands, and bade the colony farewell.!
The active principle of men's lives
is to do something for themselves.
They cannot be brought to a level, i
Owen stood for free thinking,
brotherhood, education of children, I
and higher education of the masses,
all of which he powerfully advance.!.
To-day there radiates from New
Harmony a ser.se of co-operation and
helpfulness. We are just beginning
to realize that man's character is
greatly influenced by environment.
