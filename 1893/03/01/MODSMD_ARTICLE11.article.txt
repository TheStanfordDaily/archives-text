It is advisable to keep agitating
the subject of headquarters at the
World's Fair, so that when the As
sociated Students should happen to
have another meeting, some one will
be prepared to bring the matter up,
and something definite will be de
cided upon. We repeat, that, not
withstanding the fact that we have
no alumni from whom we have been
separated for several years, a meet*
ing in Chicago, even with those
with whom we have been associated
this year, will be eujoyable. If the
idea of a separate building or room
seems impracticable, we urge that in
some convenient and centrally lo
cated hotel a Stanford register be
placed, wherein we can find the
names and addresses of all Stan
ford students together with the
dates of their arrival and possi
ble departure. At least, the matter
fliould receive considerable atten
tion, and when the Associated Stud
ents meet, some action phould be
taken.

It is not too cat In* 10 begin plan
ning for social and other e\e ts for
Commencement week. It will be a
great pity if any of our professors and
students should feel called upon to
leave the University before this im
portant week is brought to a close,
but to preclude the possibility of a
general exodus similar to that of
last year, the entire time must be
occupied with interesting and profit
able features. The week should
close with some popular social event
to include all students, who other
wi e would take the train home
after their last examination, and an
interesting concert arranged for
some evening near Commencement
day might act as a drawing card to
many who could not be held other
wise. Of course it is naturally sup
posed that the seniors and alumni
will do all in their power to arrange
for the several days at their disposal,
and as they have shown a commend
able willingness and heartiness in
the matter, we bespeak for them
hearty co-operation on the part of
all, professors and students Let
us make this week one to be lemem
bered, and a precedent for future
years.
