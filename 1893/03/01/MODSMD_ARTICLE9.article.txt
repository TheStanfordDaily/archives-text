The first preliminary field day for
this year will be held next Saturday
afternoon. Owing to the condition
of the track no rccords are expected
to be made, but in order to arouse
interest and to place track athletics
in a prominent position before the
University, it can not be too urgently
advised that all who are interested
at all in this branch of athletics
it a point to enter, and to do
so as scon as possible. Energy anil
enthusiasm must characterize this
work.
