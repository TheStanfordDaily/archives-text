# WILLIAM HOWARD MILLER
## The
						First Death Among the stanford Faculty; the Loss of a Man of Remarkable Mathematical Ability. 
### 
This morning at 1:15 o'clock
W. H. Miller died at J. A. Miller's
house in Alvarado Row.
William Howard Miller was born
in Maryland in 1869. He received
a college education in his na
tive state. In 1888 the degree of
A. B was conferred upon him by
Johns Hopkins University. During
the next two years he was a graduate
scholar in mathematics at Johns
Hopkins; and in 1889-91 he was
instructor in a preparatory school in
Csutreville, Maryland. From the
latter place he came to Stanford,
having been recommended to Prof.
Swain by Dr. Franklin, of Johns
Hopkins, who characterized him as
having the brightest mathematical
mind of any man who had ever been
a student at that university, which is
certainly a high honor, considering
the fact that Johns Hopkins prob
ably produces the majority of math
ematical professois in the United
States
At one time Mr. Mil'er was offered
a fellowship in Clark University, but
was unable to accept on account of
ill health. For four years he has
been marked as the victim of that
dread disease, consumption, which
is hereditary in his family. His
mother died of consumption. His
father, who is living with his daugh
ter in Baltimore, had consumption
until he was thirty years of age, at
which time he seems to have out
grown the disease. This was Mr.
Miller's constant wish: if he could
live until he was thirty years old he
hoped that he would be free from
the disease. On Feb. 11, 1889, he
had his lirst hemorrhage, and took
a trip to the Bermudas. He was
much improved by the sea voyage
and the tropical climate. Last sum
mer he made a similar trip to the
Hawaiian i-lands and returned to
Palo Alto in September apparently
somewhat improved in health, but
still a sick man.
Mr. Miller attended to his dulies
as instructor in mathematics in spite
of his very evidently weak and con
tinually failing condition of health.
Sixteen days ago he was compelled
to give up entirely and remain in
bed. Duiing all his illness he re
ceived every attention that skilled
mursing and kind friends could give.
Mrs. Richardson devoted her entire
time to the sick man, and different

members of the faculty cat up with
him every night
Iu speaking of him Prof. Swain
echoes the sentiments of Dr. Frank
lin in regard to his splendid math
ematical mind, and says that in
losing him the Stanford faculty loses
one of its brightest young men.
When it is considered how young
a man he was, bow faithful, alert
and earnest in his work, attending
to bis classes when he was scarcely
able to be up, with the shadow of a
continually approaching death upon
him from the time he tirat came here,
it is little wonder that he endeared
himself to all the many students
who were in his classes and who with
out exception speak in wbrds of praise
of his brightness and ability as an
instructor.
Mr. Miller was a modest, unassum
ing young man of much promise.
By reason cf bis position as in
structor and on account of his con
tinued ill health his scholars, many
of whom were his seniors knew
little of the social side and the
gentle nature of the youug man who
appeared before them in the class
room day after day. lie really had
more sympithy for his students and
really cared more for the opinion
they held of bim than he ever ex
pressed.
