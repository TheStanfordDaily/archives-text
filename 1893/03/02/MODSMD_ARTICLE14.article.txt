What It Will Cost Californians
to Go to the World's Fair.
B. N. Austin of St. Paul, Minn , j
assistant general passenger agent of I
the Northern Pacific railroad, and
A. A. Jackson of Detroit, the Mich- 1
igan representative of that road,;
were interviewed at Grand Rapids
recently. Mr. Austin is making a
tour of Michigan and getting ac
quainted with the gentlemen who:
send business over his road.
"The transcontinental lines have!
agreed upon a rate of one faro for
the round trip to the World's Fa : r,"
said Mr. Austin. "That means a
fore of 870 for the round trip from
all Pacific coast points to Chicago.
That will give about a cent and a
half a mile, which is a very liberal
rate, considering the distance, and at
the same time it will give the rail
roads a fair revenue. We are mak
ing preparations to carry a large bus
iness. Our new equipment is mostly
in sleeping cars. AVe run Pullman
sleepers almost entirely. The dis
tances are so long that we can t af
ford to run much elso. We have an
arrangement with the Pullman com
pany by which we own half the cars.
We are upholstering our tourists
cars, and will have twenty-five of
them ready to go into commission by
March Ist. In these cars a man in
moderate circumstances can get a
berth for about a third of what it 1
would cost him in an ordinary i
sleeper. It has been a pretty hard |
winter, but we have managed to ;
keep going."
