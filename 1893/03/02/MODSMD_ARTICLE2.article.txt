# Belmont Notes.
## 
### 
The second eleven has accepted
the Delta challenge, and the game
will be played on the Belmont
grounds March 4th. Wednesday a
scrub eleven was picked up to give
the second a little practice.
Now that the first eleven has dis
banded, comes a challenge from St.
Mary's. Manager Rieber challenged
every school in San Francisco and
Berkeley, and still he could not get
a game. He has not yet decided
whether to re-organize and play this
game or not.
Thursday a notice was posted by
Manager Williams for the nine to
report on the grounds Monday for
its first day's practice.
Last Fiiday Whitehouse and Lyon
came up from Stanford and stayed
all night, returning by the first train
Saturday morning.
In the senior and advanced classes
of this year there are fourteen stu
dents preparing to enter college.
Five intend going to Stanford, five
to Harvard, two to the University of
California, and two to Cornell.
