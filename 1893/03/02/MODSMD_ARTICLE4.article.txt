The violin recital given by Mr. A.
Harold Kayton last evening called
forth an audience that completely
tilled the chapel. The program was I
interesting and varied, embracing the
final movement from the Ivruetzer
Sonata. Mr. Kayton's field, though
containing many beauties, is well
defined and easily recognized. His
shortcomings are the result of tern
perament, and they were more j
noticable in this number than any
other. His playing of the Chopin;
nocturne and the "Reverie" of
Neidtielski was characterized by;
quietness, delicacy, and elegance of
phrasing. The latter work demands
virtuoso execution, and the phases of
emotion are restlessly impassionate
for the most part of the modern
style, which inclines to fluidity and
a wide gamut in preference to the
calm intensity of the classic style. ■
The number is suggestive of Chopin,
its spirit being reminiscent of the;
plaintive tenderness common to
almost every work of Chopin.
The pianist, Senor S. Martinez,
chose for his number a "Legend e" by
Liszt. Even nodded some
times, and it is not very heterodox
to say that the world would not have
been much poorer if some of the
"concert" works of Liszt were al
lowed to fall into obsolescence.
They a-e frequently bombastic and
overswollen. But if they passed
away, how could our pianists get
their fortissississimo effects? Such j
clatter could not be introduced into
Beethoven or Mozart or Hay den.
It is the highest compliment that
I can pay to the pianist to say that
he played the work ; louder than I
have ever heard it before. His whole
attention was directed to this end,
and it is but justice to say that he
achieved it. The injunction to the
psalmist to "play skilfully and with
a loud noise" was carried out in this
particular instance.
I do not pretend to say the tumult
was out of place; perhaps the blame
should rest on Liszt only, but since
the extreme possibilities of uproar
have been overcome, let us now try
to achieve a few good diminuendo
and pianissimo effects, aud see what
may be done in the direction of per
fect ensemble.
Taken as a whole the concert was
the most enjoyable eveut of a like
nature that has been given iu the
1 chapel this soason
Edward Hulme.
