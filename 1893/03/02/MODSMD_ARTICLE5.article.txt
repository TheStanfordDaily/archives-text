# Hare and Hounds.
## 
### 
Clematis and Baldwin acted as
hares in the run yesterday afternoon

Owing to some misunderstanding
they did not carry the scent all the
way, but dropped the sack when but
a short distance out; so as soon as
the hounds found the sack they im
mediately returned to Encina.
Brown was the tint to finish on
the return run. The hares took a
long course over the hills and did
not return for some time after the
return of the hounds
