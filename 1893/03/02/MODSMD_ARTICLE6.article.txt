# Gymnasium Baths.

Editor Palo Alto:
la reply to the article iu your pa
per, written by the Liliputian mil
lionaire who enclosed his last (?)
quarter for the bathroom fund, I
would like to say that the students
are not expected to put water in the
gymnasium. Why should not a sub
scription be started to purchase an
vils for the new shops, or chalk for
the recitation rooms, or for the pur
pose of plumbing Encina If all, were
it not already completed'?
Very few students have come here
prepared to assist, financially, in the
completion of the University. If
the management cannot afford to
put the baths in the gvm., let them
be left out. Don't ask the students
to do it. Not that twenty-five cents
amounts to much, but it is a bad
precedent to start.
I feel sure that if the proper per
sons should apply to the manage
ment for the water, and urge upon
them the necessity of the baths, their
application would be complied with.
