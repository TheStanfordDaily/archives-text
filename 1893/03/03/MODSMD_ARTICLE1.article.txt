## 
### 
The funeral exercises of Instructor
\V. H. Miller were held in the chapel
this afternoon at two o'clock. liev.
Alfred L. Brewer of San Mateo con
ducted the services according to the
Episcopal ritual. The scripture
reading was from Coriuthians 1.,
chap, xv., beginning at the 20th
verse.
Rev. Brewer said that throughout
life there were constant reminders of
death. That the architecture here
reminds us of a race that is gone.
While death i3 a pressing fact of life,
it is only a step to another. The
knowledge that death comes to all
and that our deeds will be remem
bered, should be a constant stimulus
to duty. When we consider that
the circle in which God works is so
large and that in which man moves
is so small, we are all liable to des
pair, but we should aim to leave
some permanent result. It is only
our character which is lasting and
can be carried with us into eternity.
Rev. Brewer then made some re
marks in regard to the teacher's call
ing and the great influence it has
upon the world.
The music was furnished by Prof.
Campbell, Mr. Stratton, Mrs.
Comstock and Miss Lowell.
The pall-bearers were Professors
Swain, J. A. Miller, Richardson,
Smith, Sampson and Allardice.
The remains of Mr. Miller were
interred near the mausoleum.
