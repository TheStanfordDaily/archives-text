# O. H. S. Notes.
## 
### 
The opening of the A. A A. A.
football season has given the Iligh '
School a chance to show what foot-1
ball material it has. The first
game was played with Cogswell's
I'ol) technic Institute, and resulted
in the defeat of that club by a score
of 22 lo 0. This indicates pretty
clearly that the 0 H. S. has a cinch
on the championship—not by reason
of her excellent playing so much as !
through the inferior playing put up
by her opponents.
The High School team possesses
many good individual players, such
as liansome, Sherman, and Wyckoff,
who played on the team last year,
and Jordan and Jim Oliver, two |
new playen—but their team work is
poor. This fault will be remedied,
probab'y, as the season advances.
The outlook for field day is poor.
The graduating class took Culver
and Brown away, and there seems to
be no one in the school to take their
places. The custom of holdiug;
semi-monthly handicap meetings j
was inaugurated Wednesday the Ist
inst., when a field day was held at
the training crounds. One new
mile runner, E. Brown, brother of
D. Brown, was brought out. There
was a full entry list for every event,
but no startling performances were
made.
Considerable interest is takeu in
the struggle between the Gamma
Eta Kappa and the new frat., Theta
Chi, over the Aegis. The election
for next term's officers comes off in
about a month, and as it is a ques
tion which frat. holds the most
shares, the election is looked for
ward to with very mixed feelings by
the stockholders. The O. 11. S.
holds the initial chapter of Theta
Chi. Its roll of charter members, so
far aB can be ascertained at present,
is remarkably good. It looks as
though the O. H S. were fully
capable of supporting two good
frats., which, in a preparatory
school, is certainly a most creditable
mark of her standing.
