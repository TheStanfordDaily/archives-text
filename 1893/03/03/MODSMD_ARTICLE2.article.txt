successful drawing teachers.
These books give an impression of

to try to justify the existence of art
and beauty, when his business is to
teach drawing. Nevertheless, he has
here intelligibly formulated and il
lustrated very many of tLe most im
portant principles of drawing, of art,
and of art study.
