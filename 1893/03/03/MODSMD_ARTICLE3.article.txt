# Field Day.
## 
### 
It will be seen by the numbers of
entries that a great deal of interest
is being taken in the field day which
is to be held to-morrow afternoon at
2:30. As new hurdles could not be

made soon enough, the two intended
hurdle races will r.ot take place, j
The track is in very poor condition,
and consequently the records of the
races and lield events are expected
to be very poor. Some very inter
esting races will undoubtedly take
place, and everyone should turn out. I

hoped that they will be before the
