# Prof. Penrose's Lecture on Fuel.

### 
The following are some points
of Prof. Penrose's lecture delivered
last night at the Geological Club.
The subject of fuel supply is, next
to that of food, the most important,
with which man has to deal.
In the early history of our race the
fuel problem was a comparatively
simple one. The forest supplied
man with abundant wood. But when
man began to evolve from the stages
in which he required only the bare
necessities of life, this need of fuel
correspondingly increased. The
greatest increase in the use of fuel
however, ever known to man, came
after the extensive introduction of
the use of steam by James Watt and
others in the latter part of the 18th
century (17G5-1800). liad we con
tinued to know no fuel but wood,
every accessible part of the earth
would probably be destitute of tim
ber, and so expensive would fuel be
that many of our greatest of modern
inventions in machinery would prob
ably be unknown. To coal therefore
we owe much of the material pro
gress of our race. The power and
prosperity of Great Britaiu and the
United States is due largely to their
immense coal supplies, assisted
largely by their iron and other in
ternal resources. The exact time at
which coal came to be a common
fuel is somewhat doubtful.
Great Britain probably began the
use of coal among the earliest of the
modern races, at about 1200 A D.
; Since then the United States and
i Belgium have become immense pro
j ducers, though Great Britain still
holds first place. The United States,
however—including wood, charcoal,
i petroleum, and gas—is the greatest
producer of fuel.
Natural gas is the cheapest, most
easily used, and the cleanest fuel
known to man. With the ex
haustion of gas, the rapid growth of
the gas regions will cease, but the
i permanence of the already existing
prosperity need not necessarily be
disturbed. It is estimated that tn
1890 the amount of natural gas used
as a fuel was equal to about $20,-
000,0C0 worth of coal.
The coal fields of the eastern
states may become exhausted, but
there will be left in the Rocky
Mountain stales and the states
thence west to the Sierra Nevadas
and evtn to the Pacific in Washing
ton and Oregon stores of coal which
will last yet for an incalculable per
iod. Nevertheless, our immense
consumption of fuel and the rapidly
increasing uses to which we devote
it warn us to be cautious. The cou-
I sumption of all kinds of fuel in this

country amounts to what would be
about equal to three and one-balf
tona pei capitum annually. By
economies tbis could probably be
reduced to two and one-balf tons
per capitum.
Rut people will not economize in
fuel unless it is cheaper for them to
do this than not to do it; therefore
the economy will have to come grad
ually. Already great advances have
been made in this direction, but
even yet our most improved prac
tical methods of producing ateam,
which is the most important use of
coal, do not utilize over about
twelve per cent of the fuel employed,
the rest being lost in wasted heat,
smoke, cinders, and gases. Much
of the steam producing apparatus in
use does not utilize more than about
thirty per cent of the heating capac
ity of the coal.
The coal mines at present opened
could not supply the demand if we
made iron and ran our locomotives
and steamships as we did twenty
yeirs ago.
In late years, however, we have
become better and better acquainted
with another force which may
in the future replace steam and thus
afford means of economizicg our
fuel. This force is electricity,
which, at the present time, is mostly
generated by dynamop. These aie
run by steam, so that iu the end
there is no saving of steam, but the
dynamos of the future may be run by
water power and thus dispense with
fuel.
With the use of wind;, which are
always uncertain, the storage of elec
tricity is a necessary feature and as
yet we cannot store electricity on a
commercial scale; but with the use
of the waters of streams and oceans
we have constant forces which only
await to be harnessed and utilized
by man. The near future will un
doubtedly be an age of electricity,
just as the present is pre-eminently
an age of steam.
