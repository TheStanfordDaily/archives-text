One condition that exists here we
take a great deal of pride and pleas
ure iu. We refer to the community
of interest existing between profes
sors and students. Still it would
seem that. more of our students
ought to avail themselves of the
opportunity of meeting our profes
sors at their homes. Most of them,
with their wives, are "at homo" to
students and friends one night in
the week, and any ar.d all will wel
come visitors at most any time
Quite a great deal of inspiration can
be derived from a closer communi
cation with our professors than mere
class-room work secures for us.
