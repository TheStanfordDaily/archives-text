In this issue will be found a com
munication relative to a couple of
dramatic events for Commence
ment week. We ure iu hearty
sympathy with such a movement,
and we feel sure that sufficient
interest will he taken in the
matter to make tho two enter
tainments eminently successful and
enjoyable. With time and the
propt r incentive there is no reason
why our dramatic talent should not
be able to pioduce high-class per
formances. It is customary in other
univeisities to give to at least two

such events during the course of the
year a prominent position in the
social life of the student body, to
look forward to them and to attend
en masse. Our last farce was a little
too impromptu to mako it what
might be termed a social event, but
a well prepared and costumed per
i'ormance at the close of the year,
anticipated many weeks before it
occurs, will be such and will leave
pleasant recollections in the minds
of those who leave Tor good the
walls of our beloved university home
