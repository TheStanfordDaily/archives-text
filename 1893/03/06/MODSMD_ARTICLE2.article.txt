Prof. Sampson delivered the ser
mon Sunday morning in the chapel.
The subject was "Conventionality."
The discourse was opened bv the
following most siucere and touching
tribute to the late Prof. W. 11. Miller:
I should feel untrue 10 the mem
ory of my friend Howard Miller if
I did not say a word this morning
about the loss we have suffered.
You who knew only his pitiful
shadow as he went to and from his
classes can not realize the strong char
acter of the man. He was not only
able in mathematics, but he was
thorough in whatever he attempted.
He wa9 a man of remarkable insight,
and looked " quite through the deeds
of men." He was a true friend, and
above all, a gentleman. Ilis life
was not a failure. May such praise
be ours.
In his sermon Professor Samp
son said that no man was en
tirely conservative or liberal, that
conservatism and liberalism are two
dominant strains of man's nature.
He is constantly asked to choose be
tween them. To declare that each
is good in its place is to evade the
question, and it is an issue upon
which happiness depends.
Youth striving to reach the ideal
finds nothing so trying as conserva
tive old age which has given up the
struggle. We feel u sympathy with
Byron and Shelley, the type of re
bellion against things. i'outh in
vites this spirit of revolt against
conventions. It recognizes that con
ventionality is responsible for many
ills, and it wishes to free the world.
A person of great character and
Intellect can avoid conventionality.
Great reformers break down conven
tions. There are two kinds of con
ventionality—that of mind and that
of manner. That of manner defines
how we should treat our acquaint
ances and friends, and it is useful as

a safeguard against intrusion. A
conventional mind is a more serious
thing. To depart from custom is to
depart for rules of others. If neces
sary to be different, then
tionality is healthy. A guidirg prin
ciple b true politeness.
