The Euphronians met a3 usual
Saturday evening and a program of
unusual interest waa carried out.
The Hawaiian question waa debated
extempore by Messrs. Field and
Taber. "Harrison's Administration"
was the subject of an impromptu by
Mr. Bullock, who, true to the lie
publican party, had nothing but
praise for tiie ex-president. Mr.
Dodd was the declaimer of the even
ing, and his rendition of " 'Ostler
Joe" was commendable. The Shakes
peare-Bacon contrjversy was the
question of the regular debate.
Messrs. Cathcart and Sandwick ar
gued from the orthodox standpoint,
while the side of the heretics was
taken by Messrs. Gunnand Matthew.
The debaters had prepared with great
care, and their discussion of this dif
ficult question was a credit to the
society.
In the business meeting a half
hour was devoted to parliamentary
drill. The innovation proved most
profitable and if such drills are kept
up they will undoubtedly produce
some good parliamentarians.
