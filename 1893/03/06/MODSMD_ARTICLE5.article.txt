Since your published record of
entries for the preliminary lield day,
we have decided to withdraw from 1
the mile relay. We believe with
Yale that graduate students should
not take advantage of their mature
strength and greater endurance to
curry oft' the prizes that would be
valued so much more highly by the
undergraduates. Moreover, our
thirst for glory has been satiated in ;
defeating such men as ex-Captain 1
C'lemans, Brown with the winged I
feet, and Mountain Climber Murphy,
iu the recent test to determine who
should represent the class.
