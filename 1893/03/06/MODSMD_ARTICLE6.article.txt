# For Commencement Week.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Since your last two issues no little
interest bus been aroused regarding
commencement week. The faculty ;
are much in favor of an attractive
program that will keep students here
until commencement day. Instruc
tion ends on Wednesday, May 24th, i
leaving just a week till commence
ment, the 31st.
The Palo Alto suggested last
week that a concert be arranged for
some night daring the week With- 1
out doubt the musical talent in the
University could unite and give a
most enjoyable evening to the rest of
us. The Glee Club recently organ
ized might make this an object in
view.
Suppose this concert be given on
Thursday or Friday night. Then
on Saturday night the commence
ment theatricals could take place in
the gymnasium. Plans are already
being made fora dramatic club,
which will make such a performance
its object Two plays, one a good
corned}', the other an original cur- 1
tain raiser, will probably be the
plan. Whether local, hits will be
shunned is to be decided,
The piny chosen will perhaps de- j
mand costumes and stage furnish
ings, and these will be paid for from
the receipts. A very effective enter
tainment can be given in the gymna
sium at small cost, and those taking
part will have a greater interest
in the undertaking if the play;
be well staged.
Monday is class day, with its ex
ercises and, possibly, the senior hop
in the evening. Then comes alumni
day on Tuesday, and Tuesday even
ing the entertainments of the week

might close wiili the big promen
ade.
Let uo one discourage the idea of
a promenade concert. Our quad
rangle gives an opportunity not to
be neglected. Other colleges may
have class day exercises, concerts
and theatricjla but Stanford may
make her promenade inimitable.
Last year the concert was a failure
because of a bad stringed orchestra
and worse weather, but with a good
military baud, the promenade must
be the crowning event of the year.
Besides, it is a general affair in every
way, all being interested.
The entertainments at Berkeley
are attended by many outsiders, and
when had Berkeley such a chance
as ours? There were San Francisco
people here for the farce a week ago
and our promenade might be made
an event for others beside ourselves.
Surely we could never show our
quadrangle under more pleasing
conditions.
Last year there was no difficulty
in raising the necessary money from
the student body. In addition to
the subscription this year, the pro
ceeds of the Dramatic Club's enter.
tainm6nt will be donated to the
promenade fund, and in tlii-i way
ample money may be raised for the
object.
These are a few suggestions If
the students generally will take an
interest in these plans and suggest
others, the gymnasium and the
quadrangle should be gay enough
during the last week of the year, and
the days between examination rnd
vacation will be pleasant ones to re
member.
