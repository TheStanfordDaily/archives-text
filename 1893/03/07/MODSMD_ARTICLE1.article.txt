# OUR FACULTY.
## Additions and Changes. 
### 
Benjamin Harrison has declared
his willingness to accept the position
at Stanford of non-resident lecturer
in constitutional and international
law. His formal acceptance is ex
pected by mail in a few days. Pres
ident Jordan has left the number of
the lectures, their frequency, and
their character entirely with Mr.
Harrison, who will be allowed to
suit his own convenience and taste
in the matter of his annual stay at
Palo Alto There will be, however,
about thirty lectures delivered by
Mr. Harrison during October and
November of each year. The salary
that will be pr id is determined by
Senator Stanford. There is no truth
whatever in the wild newspaper
statements that have been circulated
in regard to Mr. Harrison's probable
acceptance of an appointment at
Palo Alto, and the exorbitant salary
that it has been intimated he would
receive. Fifty dollars a lecture fora
series of lectures is the highest price
that has been paid to a non resident
lecturer at a university, but in all
probability Mr. Harrison's salary
will exceed this amount.
The department of law will be
under the general management of
Prof. Abbott, who will be here next
September; but Mr. Harrison will be
independent of him and of the regu
lar law department. All books nec
essary for the study of law will be
added to the library as fast as the
needs of the University and the work
of the students may require. It was
intimated not long ago that a certain
professor did not accept a call to
Stanford because of the lack of a
good law library. We have it on
good authority that such was not the
case. Stanford has not yet a law li
brary of any extent; she has not yet
had a law course. It is absurd to
suppose that a lavish outlay fora law
library would have been made before
the demands of the University re
quired any such collection. The se
lection of books fora new library is
a very difficult task, and the librarian
is kept busy choosing and purchas
ing the latest and most improved
editions.
Recently Professors Hudson and
Show have been advanced from as
sistant professors to associate pro
fessors in English and history re
spectively.
Two new professors have been
chosen since the appointment of
Professor Ross to the department of
finance and Prof. Abbott to the de
partment of law.
Rufus L Green has been called to

Stanford, and has accepted an asso
ciate professorship in mathematics.
Prof. Green was born in 1860. Ke
graduated from the University of
Indiana in 1885; was instructor in
mathematics at that university in
1885-86; a student at Johns Hop
kins University in 1886-87, and has
been professsor of pure mathematics
at the University of Indiana since
1887. He was a student for one
year at Cornell, where he made a
special study of algebra in its ele
mentary and higher forms. His
mathematical mind in its keen per
ceptive power is of much the same
character as that which Mr. W. H.
Miller possessed. Prof. Green has a
wife and two children. He will be
here next September.
Another of the recent appoint
ments is that of Vernon Lyman Kel
logg, M. S., assistant professor of
entomology. Prof. Kellogg gradu
ated from the University of Kansas
in 1889, when he received the degree
of B. S.; in 1892 the degree of M. S.
was conferred upon hioi by the same
university. He was instructor of bi
ology and zoology at the University
of Kansas in ISSB-89; was a student
in entomology at Cornell in 1891,
and since 1890 has b;en assistant
professor of entomology in the Uni
versity of Kansas. During the whole
of Chancellor Snow's administration
Prof. Kellogg acted as his private
secretary. He is the son of Attorney
General Kellogg of Kansas, and is
twenty-five years of age.
There will be several other ap
pointments before next September
A professor of electrical engineering
and another professor in history are
yet to be added to our faculty, which
now numbers seventy-seven persons
distributed as follows: Thirty-three
professors, eight associate professors,
thirteen assistant professors, fifteen
instructors, and eight assistants.
Although President White of Cor
nell is on a leave of absence as
United States Minister (o St. Peters
burg, he will very likely be here dur
ing February and March of next
year, as the democratic administra
tion may affect many of President
Harrison's appointments, and he will
then resume his work here as non
resident professor of European
historv.
