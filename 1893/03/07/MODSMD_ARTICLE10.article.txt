# Cambridge's Presence at the World's Fair Will Not Affect Yale.
## 
### 
Captain Ives is quoted as saying
that Yale will not enter the World's
Fair regatta, no matter whether the
English crews do so or not. The
reasons are stated as follows: the
invitations for the regatta are
not sufficiently exclusive; the Chi
cago TSavy is getting altogether too
many crews to enter. Secondly,
there is no good course in Chicagoâ€”
Yale wishes to row a four mile
straight-away or nothiug at all.
And further, it, will be very warm in
Chicago, and not the best place for
a crew. Captain Ives has no doubt
but a race will be arranged between
the Cambridge crew and the winner
of the New London race next June,
but it will be rowed over some east
ern course.
