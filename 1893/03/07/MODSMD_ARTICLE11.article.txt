# Athletics and College Life.

### 
It is amusing to observe what
positions some people take in regard
to athletics. What makes the fol
lowing all the worse is that it comes
from a college paper, ltreuds:
The athletic annex to a college or
university involves a needless ex
penditure of money. Athletics al
most double the expenses of the stu
dent. Where athletics have become
popular in an institution, it has
taken control of the institution, it'
has taken control of the work of that;
institution. All the honors are dis ■
tributed among the athletes. The
man with the most muscle is the
Great Mogul. To-day Itnssell is
Governor of Massachusetts, not be
cause of his great intellect, but
through the patronage of Harvard
athletes. The object of college
training is not to turn out Kilrains
and Sullivans, bu*, to sharpen the
intellect and broaden the man.
There was a day when the plumes
of the knight adorned the cap that
crowned the strongest knots of
brawn, but that was an age coeval
with bull-fights and duels. No per
son with refined sensibilities can
look upon a modern game of foot- j
ball, with all its cruelty, and feel
that it is in keeping with our civili- 1
zation.
