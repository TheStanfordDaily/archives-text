a field day with Berkeley this year,
that they would not meet us in base
ball. The secretary was instructed
to communicate with Mr. Mays, ex
plaining the condition of our track
aad stating that, in all probability, an
intercollegiate field day could not
be entered into by us this year,
but that the matter had been re
ferred to the Advisory Committee for
their immediate consideration.
The treafcurer was instructed to
publish a financial statement of re
ceipts and expenditures in the
Daily Palo Alto at the beginning
of each month, and to have the first
one published immediately.
Houghton Sawyer was nominated
for football manager and elected by
acclamation.
