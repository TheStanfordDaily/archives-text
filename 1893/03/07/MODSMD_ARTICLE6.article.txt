# Spring Tennis Tournament.
## 
### 
The committee on tennis has de
cided to hold a spring tournament
Saturday, March 18th.
Singles, doubles and mixed
doubles will be played. The intro
duction of mixed doubles is a new
feature in our tournaments, and it
is hoped that the change will inspire
a little more enthusiasm in this
much neglected branch of our uni
versity athletics.
All the preliminary playing will
be done on Friday, the 17th, and
Saturday morning. The mixed
doubles will be played on the lloble
courts.
Prizes will be awarded the win
ners of the first and second places
in all events, and in order to secure
appropriate prizes an entrance fee
ot" fifty cents will be chaiged for
each entry. All names must be
handed to Cole, Jones or Davey be
fore Thursday noon, March lGth.
Everyone who has any tenuis abil
ity at all should finter this tourna
ment and by his playing find out
what rank he holds with the other
players, even if he does not win a
prize. A contest will be held with
Berkeley in May, and many men
should strive to get on the team that
will represent us. Lack of experi
ence should discourage no one; for
there were men on last year's team
who never held a racket before enter
ing the University, and who helped
to win the contest by their good
playing.
