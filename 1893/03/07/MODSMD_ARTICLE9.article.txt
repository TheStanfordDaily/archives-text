The senior class, that is, the ma
jority of the class, has decided that
a dance as a feature of the com
mencement exercises would be in
bad form. Now dancing is not al
ways in place, and a few very strict
sects object to it, but as one of
society's chief and most harmless
evening amusements its very infre
quent introduction into college life
certainly could not demoralize the
sedate senior just as he is about to
leave his ahiici run fir and go forth
into the world, where it is presumed
he would occasionally take part in
social life It seems as though the
senior might unbridle his long
maintained dignity on the occasion
of his last day at college and allow
himself to have a thoroughly enjoy
able time that would be a pleasur
able reminder of his college life.
