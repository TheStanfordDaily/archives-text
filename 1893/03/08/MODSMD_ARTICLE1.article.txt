# THE
						FIRST JOINT DEBATE.
## Resolved, That the Hawaiian Islands Should Be Annexed. 
### 
Congress Take 3 the Affirmative, and
Alpha the Negative.
The first joint debate between
Congress and Alpha was held last
evening in the chapel according to
announcement. Prof Barnes as the
presiding officer won much praise
for his pleasing and interesting man
ner throughout the evening.
The exercises were opened with
music furnished by the Quartette,
which received its usual hearty ap
plause. The question discussed was
Resolved, That the Hawaiian islands
should be annexed to the United
States. The affirmative was "opened
by W. P. Chamberlin, whose outline
is as follows:
The geographical position of the
Hawaiian islands gives them great
strategic and commercial value. As
a natural part of the American sys
tem and capable of dominating the
Pacific, they are of especial value to
the United States. Territorial ex
pansion by annexation is a well de
fined principle of our national polity,
by virtue of which the United Stateß
has acquired over two-thirds of its
present area. The right of rev
olution is inherent in every nation. |
The right of interference by an in
terested nation is a principle of inter
national law. The annexation of
Hawaii is only another step by the i
United States towards the extension
of her domain to its natural bound
aries.
The first speaker on the negative
was A. C. Trumbo. He began by a
short discussion of individual and
international rights which individ
uals and nations must necessarily
observe in order to prosper. As the
United States was founded upon the
free consent of a free people it
should not annex an independent
nation without that nation's consent.
The United States has not the con
sent of the Hawaiian nation accord
ing to either theory of a true gov
ernment, viz.: first, that the gov
ernment gains its power from the
consent of the governed; and, sec
ond, that it gains its power from its
ability to maintain itself. Evidence
was shown that the annexationists
were moved by mercenary motives,
and that United States Minister
Stevens had interfered with Hawai
ian affairs.
If contract labor were abolished in
the islands—since it is absolutely

necessary in such a tropical country
—the industries would die. The in
flexibility of our tariff would compel
Hawaiians to pay higher prices than
at present, aud the conflict of inter
ests to be protected here and there
would cause unending trouble.
Mr. Warren began by sayirg that
this was not the inauguration of a
scheme of foreign conquest, but that
it was the desire of the United States
government to annex with the cheer
ful consent of the people of the
islands. Jle showed that almost the
entire population of the islauds want
annexation; he described there- j
sources of the islands, showed their
importance to our future commercial
interests and their value to us in a
military way, depicting the encroach
ments already made by Great Britain
around our continent. He showed
from the logic of events that to
anuex wa9 the only course now left
open to the United States, and that
by annexing, the United States!
would only be acting according to
justice and would, moreover, be tak
ing a long stride toward that great
ness which the intelligence and in
dustry of our citizens entitle this i
government to assume among na
tions.
Mr. J. M. Rhodes closed the neg
ative discussion. Additional evi
dence was shown against Minister
Stevens, and also that the natives
were decidedly opposed to annexa
tion. England cou'd not release
herself from the treaty with France
of 1843 without the consent of
France, which was very improbable.
Moreover, England showed no inter
est in the matter, and could not af
ford a war with the United Sta'.es,
considering her foreign complica
tions. We have already the advan
tages of a naval station in the islands
and since the United States is the
best market for Hawaii we can retain
our control of it by treaty. Over
ninety-one per cent of Hawaii's trade
is with the United States.
It is against our national principle
to become entangled in foreign alli
ances to which annexation leads.
The people of Hawaii are not edu
cated to republican institutions.
Foreign possessions aie a &ouice
| of weakness, as illustrated by those
of England. Australia is desirous
i of a republic, India is held under
1 military control, Canada wishes to
be annexed to the United States.
The judges were Professors How
ard, Swain, and Marx, two of whom
voted in favor of the affirmative aud
one for tho negative. The decision
is supported by some and objected
to by others. It is safe to say that
all the debaters do not feel satisfied

with their speeches on account of
the limited time. All were called
down when in the most interesting
part of their discussion.
It is to be regretted that on ac
count of sickness Mr. Ward Bannis
ter could not take part in the nega
tive discussion. On this account
Mr. Robert Gruwell kindly withdrew
from the affirmative.. A large and
appreciative audience greeted the
speakers, and it is hoped that an
other joiut debate will soon be an
nounced.
