# Regents of U.C. Must Be Graduates of That Institution.
## 
### 
The bill providing that the major
ity of the Board of Regents of the
State University shall be composed
of graduates of that institution,
came up in the legislature.
Simpson spoke at length, saying
that the university was something
of a disappointment to him; that
there was too much attention given
to religious instruction there. At
all times Salvation Army song 3
could be heard ringing out of the
windows, and that the teachers were
having Bible classes instead of teach
ing the curriculum prescribed by
the regents, and he thought that the
passage of the bill would tend to
correct this evil. The bill was passed.
