# A
						Letter to the Boat Club.

### 
The letter we publish below may
be of intorest to those who are en
deavoring to organize a crew for the
aquatic contest at Chicago next sum-1
mer. Its contents, however, are
not very encouraging toward send
ing on a crew. If we were backed
by an old and rich alumni, such a
thing would be feasible, but under
the present conditions our best pol
icy is to drop the World's Fair
scheme and meet the University of
California. They are eager to enter
a race with us this spring. Such a
race would be much easier to get
ready for and would be one from
which we could get a great deal;
more satisfaction. Why not let the
World's Fair race drop and make
arrangements with Berkeley? "When
this is done and a race is definitely
decided upon the proper amount of
enthusiasm will be aroused and
some iucentive given for men to
train. Already look how long east
ern crews have been in training. If
we cannot get a crew in training for
this year, we can at least prepare
for next year.
The following is the letter received
this morning in answer to one ee;it
asking what inducements were in
store:
Chicago, March 3, 1893.
Daniel Searles, Esq.,
Sec'y- Leland Stanford Jr. Boat
Club,
Dear Sir:-
Yours of Feb. 23d received. It
will be impossible for the Chicago
navy to ofter any inducement to
your college crew more than free
transportation for your crew from
, Chicago to L iko Geneva and return,
including your boats.
The international regatta will be
held at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin,
a summer resort sixty miles from
this city. Very low rates have been
secured at the best hotels at that
! place at about $L.50 per day.
A large commcdious boathouse
will be erected for the care of boats,
under au insurance policy. Elegant
I gold medals accompanied by silken
banners will be given to the winning

crews, and everything in our power
will be done to make the stay of the
oarsmen pleasant. We have re
ceived word from almost every col
lege in the country signifying their
willingness to be present, and it is
the rowing men of the west who
desire to have a western college
compete with some of their eastern
brethren.
This will be the largest gathering
of college men in aquatic sports
that has ever been held and we earn
