# Berkeley Notes.
## 
### 
The U. C. cinder track is being
put in condition. A man is kept at
work on it all the time, weeding,
watering and rolling. A great many
men are trying for the track athletic
team, and a few records are expected
to be lowered by them.
The rumor that Ed. Mays, the
100-yd. man, was not training is
false, as he is hard at work getting
ready for the spring field day. The
Berkeley boys hope to hold the
inter-collegiate field day gome time
in the last of April.
The baseball team is in the hands
of a professional coach, who expects
to make the boys work hard to win
the pennant.
Tennis tournaments are to be held
regularly and everything possible is
to be done in that line to win back
the tennis championship from Palo
Alto.
