Upon* tbe bulletin board near the
registrar's office are samples of rib
bons in different college colors.
These are manufactured in uniform
shades and widths by Uullion &
Co. of San Francisco. It has been
suggested that a committee of the
student body be appointed to select
a shade of cardinal and designate
this or some other firm a3 the place
where the official Stanford cardinal
may be procured. The chosen
house would then have the color
made to order and kept in stock.
In the past we have manifested
our allegiance to Stanford in colors
ranging all the way from pink to
garnet. There would be no excuse
for any such display in the future if
we knew where to go for the official
shade.
