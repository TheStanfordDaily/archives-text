By ]ast Eight's debate the way Las
been opened fora series of literary
events, which in the past have been
so sadly neglected here. There is
1.0 reason why such maters should
not attract more attention than has
been centered in thern up to the
present time. Athletics receive their
interest, as is proper they should,
but there is a fault existing some
where if a portion of the student
body fail to ruauifest their enthusi
asm in literary events. There are
nearly eight hundred students here,
jet ihe deaith of literary men that

have f-o far come to notice would put
many of the smaller eastern colleges
to shame.
We believe the answer to all this
lack of action lies, not in tbe fact
tbat we do not posstss men of this
stamp, but eimply on account of the
failure of tbose interested in such j
work to put forward tbeir efforts in
a field almost entirely unoccupied.
Pray let us not stop witb tbe good
beginning made last night. Let it
coniinue. Another joint debate in !
the mar future will lead up to a fit
-1 ting culmination of this work in tin
j intercollegiate joint debate. If these
debates are propeily worked up, no
one need fear tbey will fall short of
hearty approval nnd fail for want of
proper support by tbe students.
An oratorical contest near the
close of this semester is something
that must take place. We can ill
afford to let tbe custom started in
tbat direction last year die out. If
we expect the contest to be a suc
cessful issue, preparations must be
entered into immediately. These
matters have been discussed in these
i columns before, and now let us take i
emphatic action before it grows too j
late.
