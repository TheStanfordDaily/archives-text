# U. C. AND STANFORD CREWS.
## The 						Annual Race Will Probably Take Place Some Time in May. 
### 
In Tuesday's Examiner there ap
peared au item from Berkeley, stat
ing that the committee appointed by
the University of California to con
fer with Stanford regarding the pro
spective boat race between crews
from the two institutions, had waited
in vain all Saturday evenirg, at Mr.
Morrrow's bouss in Oakland, for
the committee from here to meet
them as had been agreed upon. The
Berkeley correspondent is mistaken
-in this matter. Mr. Stuchell, presi
dent of our boat club, went to Oak
land Saturday evening as our repre
sentative and met the Berkeley men
according to agreement.
It was definitely decided to have
a race between the two university
crews some time iu May. The U. C.
men were rather in favor of its being
a four-oared race, as they thought it
would be somewhat difficult to get
an eight into proper condition in the
short time remaining before the race
would take place; but this question
was left for future decision.
The men will go into training as
soon aa possible, and it is expected
that two crews will be secured from
the universities that will prove an
honor to them. The U. C. men es
pecially are very enthusiastic over
the prospects, and intend, as far as
they are concerned, to make the boat
race one of the greatest events in
university life on the Pacific coast.
It is true that both universities are
handicapped in the lack of experi
enced oarsmen, but hard training
will go a long way in the next few
weeks toward overcoming this ob
stacle. Last year Stanford Univers
ity showed what she could do in the
football line, with only raw material;
let her keep up her good record and
show what enthusiasm and energy
can do toward turning out a first
class crew this spring.
There seems to be a doubt as to
whether or not the money for the
eight oared shell, so kindly offered
us by Senator and Mrs. Stanford, was
given only on condition that we
send a crew to Chicago to race dur
ing the World's Fair. The general
impression seems to be that this was
the condition on which they sub
scribed it. Mr. Stuchell has writ
ten to Mrs. Stanford about the mat
ter and expects an answer within a
few days. Since there is now
small prospect of our crew going to
Chicago, it is sincerely hoped that
the shell was offered uncondition
ally.
