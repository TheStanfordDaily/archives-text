The dearth of good music fit Stan
ford has been the subject of frequent
comment this winter, and it is with
pleasure that we note the concert to
bo given in the chnpcl on Friday by
the club organized last fall among
the faculty. Thus far the club has
held only two open meetings, to
which only a limited number could
be invited on account of want of
room.
With the assistance of some stud
ents the club gives the entertain
ment at the request of the University
Christian Association, in order to
raise funds for the current expenses
of the association, and more es
pecially for the rent of a good piano.
It is to be hoped that the proceeds
may be enough to warrant keeping
the grand piano which Prof. Flugel
has lent for the eveniug. Let every
one who is interested in music or in
the prosperity of the University
Christian Association go and swell
the fund.
