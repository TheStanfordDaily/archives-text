acted upon immediately by the com- j
mittee on tennis-. Wo learn that,

good and valid reasons may be i
given for the necessity of such a
change.
First, owing to rain and wind,
many players have not been i

Third, at any season of the year I
ten days is decidedly too short a
notice to give of an approaching
tournament. When we do have a
contest, it should ceitainly be some-,

will place on the court a set of raw,
untrained players wlio will put up a
poor exhibition of tennis playing and
lessen the interest that should al
ways center around a hotly contested
tournament. There is no necessity
why the date should be fixed so
early and therefore we hope the com
mittee will postpone the event and
arrange fora first-class tournament,
say a week or so after the spring
vacation.
