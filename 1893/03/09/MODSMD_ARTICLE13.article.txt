The matter of an oratorical con
test is too important a one to dis
miss with a mere mention By all
means we must have such a contest
this year. It will not do to let the
subject drop. We suggest that the
matter be arranged soon, fora yearly
contest :o be held during commence
ment week. Suitable prizes must be
offered and given to the winners.
Whatever objections we may have as
a rule to prizes, medals, etc., we feel
that here, at least for several years,
they must be offered as a necessary
incentive, along with the honor that
will accrue to the winner. If such
rewards are properly announced and
an interest is aroused in the subject,
we cannot see why many fine ora
tors will not begin hard work and
why a contest between them at the
end of the year will not be emi
nently successful. It cannot help
but be; and in connection with some
orchestra or othei music, an inter
esting entertainment will offered.
Certainly everyone is going to stay
through commencement week, so
there can be no objection to the
time suggested. By all means let
us have an interesting event of this
kind during the last week.
