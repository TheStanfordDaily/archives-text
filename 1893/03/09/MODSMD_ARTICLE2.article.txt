# Materials for the Museum.

### 
Our large museum, heretofore only
an object of interest in regard, to the
building itself, will soon contain a
collection that will be both interest-1
ing and instructive to those who j
visit it. Several hundred boxes of j
curios are already stored in the
building, and will be unpacked as
soon as the finishing touches are put
on the rooms which are to receive!
them.
The Egyptian room in the north-1
west corner of the building will be I
the first one fitted up. Two large;
columns with Egyptian decorations |
adorn the back end of the room, and
adding to the architectural beauty is ;
a recess between these colums, which j
causes the room to terminate in a J
semi circular wall. The columns I
and &ides of the recess have been
covered with a delicate tinge of pink, j
which is strikingly beautiful in con
trast with the bare white walls of the '
main room. This room with the
two adjoining will contain the large
collection of Egyptian curios which
Mrs. Stanford has spent years in col
lecting. The space afforded by these
rooms is over five thousand five hun
dred square feet.
1 he two back rooms on the first
and second fioors will contain the
collections made by Leland Stan
ford, Junior. The one on the sec- j
ond fioor, which is provided with a
burglar proof door and combination
lock, will contain the small special
collections first gathered by him.
The double marble stairway to
the second floor has for its landing
the top of a beautiful marble arch
about twenty-five feet high. The
staircase railing is bronze with brass
trimmings.
Mrs. Stanford has already gath
ered a collection for the museum
which will entirely fill the immense
building. Senator Stanford's "Gov
ernor's coat," worn by him when
governor of this state, will be placed
in the museum, as will also the
spade with which he turned the first
solid earth in the construction of the ,
Southern Pacific railroad.
