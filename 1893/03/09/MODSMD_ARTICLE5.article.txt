Editors Daily Palo Alto:
If we keep up the practice of hav
ing semi-weekly liare and hound
runs we will shortly be able to make
a good run of ten or twelve miles,
perhaps even more. After having
had considerable practice would it
not be a good idea to hold a joint
hare and hounds run with the
Olympic Club? In the summer this
club often holds cross country runs
and many participants engage in the
race Possibly Milbrae could be de
termined on as a meeting place and
the chase start from there.
I would like to have some enter
prising persons take hold of this
matter and communicate with the
Olympic Club. Such runs as these
would be beneficial to us and tend
to establish a stronger feeling of
friendship between the Olympic
Club and us. We have some very
strong runners here who could up
hold the honor of Stanford.
