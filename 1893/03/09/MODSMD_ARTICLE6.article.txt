# Religious Teaching at Berkeley.
## 
### 
A great deal of comment has been
caused by the remark of State Senator
Simpson, of Alameda, in regard to
the religious instruction at tbe State
University. Senator Simpson, in
speaking on the bill to elect the re
gents from the graduates of the State
University, said that he was not so
much in favor of seeing the alumni
running the university as he was to
see a change from the present meth
ods, and he favored the measure in
the hope that that change would be
brought about. What he had objec
tion to at present was the alleged
fact that too much religion was in
dulged in at the university and not
enough attention paid to the cur
riculum. The students were being
taught all sorts of Salvation Army
songs, and the professors were con
ducting regulation Bible classes.
The senator said that he was a
believer in religious teaching, but
he thought a state institution was
the wrong place for it. He hoped
that if the bill passed the alumni
regents would make the change that
he desired.
One of the professors of the Uni
versity of California said last night
when seen by an Examiner reporter:
"There is absolutely no foundation
for such statements. Certainly
this a non-sectarian institution, but
that does not necessarily imply that
there shall be no religious teaching
as an adjunct to the development
of the mind. Attendance at the
meetings of the Young Men's Cluis
tian Association is not compulsory,
but all who desire to attend and

participate are invited and cordially
welcomed. Hymns such as are sung
at any prayer meeting are rendered,
but to call these Salvation Army
songs, is, to sav the least, an exag
geration. lam thoroughly con
vinced that the presence of these
collegiate religious organizations
exerts a beneficial influence over the
young men and women at Berkeley.
Such remarks as those made at the
state legislature can do our institu
tion no good."
