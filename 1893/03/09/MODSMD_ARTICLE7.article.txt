# Belmont Notes.
## 
### 
The game last Saturday ended
with a score of C to 4 in favor of the
home team. The Deltas played a
much better game so far as the
team work went and their interfering
was good, but the second eleven
made up for its lack of discipline by
its individual playing. The latter's
bucking the line was especially good
for an eleven of its grade. It rained
a great part of the game and rather
kept the few visitors that were pres
ent indoors.
The first eleven have been on the
field hard at work practicing for the
game to be played on March llih.
Three or four changes have been
made which no doubt will strengthen
the eleven. This game will end
football at Belmoot for this season.
A delegation of ten or twelve
went to Redwood Saturday night to
hear the Stanford Mandolin Club,
but found they had been misin
formed as to the date.
Among the visitors this week were
Messrs. II Truinbo, Lyon and Cot
ton of Stanford.
