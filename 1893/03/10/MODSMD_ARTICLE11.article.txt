# Oakland High School Notes.
## 
### 
The members of the graduating
class are beginning to discuss tLe
courses of study offered by the U.
C. and the L S. Jr. U. Opinion is
fairly divided, considering that the
close vicinity of the U. C. gives it a
better field than the L. S. Jr. U.
has A great deal of indirect influ
encing is done by the teachers, who
naturally take a keen interest in,
aud, in the matter r t choosing a uni
versity, possess considerable influ
ence over the graduates. A very
large class—the largest ever gradu
ated —will go out this term.
The choosing of an O. H. S. pin
by the middle Band two senior
classes, is tbe latest question agi
tated. The object is to have a
school pin such as the U. C. has,
one by which the wearer can, at a
glance, be identified as anO. H. S.
scholar. A pin has finally been set
tled upon and will shortly be issued.
The struggle between Gamma Eta
Kappa and Theta Chi, over the JSgis
election, has settled down into a de
termined pull between forty-nine
and fifty shares. Curious to say, it
is an undecided question which has
forty-nine and which fifty shares.
The boys are training faithfully
for the A. A. A A. field day, but
there are too few of them to accom
plish much. There is no excitement
over the football games, as the
school takes it as a settled question
that the O. H. S. will win the pen
nant without a struggle. Circum
stances seem to justify this confident
spirit.
Wyckofl has quit football for the
term, owing to sever injuries sus
tained on the ankle. It is his inten
tion, however, to enter the A A. A. A.
field dav.
