It is to be regretted that the stu
dents' and professors' residences on
the campus are so scattered anil
seemingly so removed from each
other. The social, the friendly re
lations of the male students who live
on the campus cente sin Eacina
Hall, while that of the young ladies
is confined to Roble, and we all
know that hospitable entertainment
of calling and visiting friends is not
very practicable in either of the
large halls. The professors and
their families seem to be relegated
to a rather isolated life in the rows,
whither, by reison of the lack ol
more favorable surroundings 011 the
campus to suggest sociability, the
students are, to a great fxtent, re
luctant in going to make calls.
it is our duty as probable mem
bers of future social communities
where the distinction of teacher and
pupil will not exist to inspire awe in
us all, to be more sociable during
our university life. The barrier of
scholastic position which must exist
to a certain extent in the lecture
room and lestrain the student from
familiar converse with his teacher

need not and should riot exist out
side of it.
Tije professors wolcome students
to their homes to call, and most of
them have special evenings on which
to receive, but what Las tbe student
on the campus in the way of social
entertainment to extend to them in
return? The condition of campus
life is such by reason of the position
of tbe dwelling places that those in
the rows may be said practically to
live a life within themselves. This
should not be, and were the condi
tions under which lesidences may be
erected upon tlie grounds different,
we might look fora more thickly
settled community and consequently
a more neighborly spirit among the
whole University population.
