The students in Drawing V., who
have been drawing casts with Miss
Ames since the beginning of the
year, yesterday commenced to work
from life with Prof. Brown. It is
the first life class that has been held,
and as there are as yet no arrange
ments fora regular model, the mem
bers of the class themselves in turn
act as models. Considerable enthu
siasm was manifested, and the work
promises to be very interesting.
