Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Of late there have been several
articles in the Palo Alto about a
tennis tournament to be held for the
purpose of preparing our players for
the annual tournament with U. C.
In one of these articles it was said
that the Berkeley boys are taking
active steps to tit their players for
the struggle. Lafet year the tourna
ment was a tie one to the end, our
team winning by the merest scratch.
This year our team has been
strengthened by the advent of two
fine players, but it is understood
that the Berkeley team also has
been very materially strengthened.
The outcome of the match is doubt
ful, to say the least, unless we can
produce some new material. And
this absolutely can not be done if a
handicap or class tournament is not
held.
There are eight or ten men who
are conceded to be above all otheis.
The new men, who are uncertain as
to their real merit, think it would
be folly to meet these veterans with
out any skirmishing with other
players. If' a non-handicap tourna
ment is held the new material will
not enter. A class tournament
would not only increase the candi
dates for the team, but would add
greatly to the interest in tennis.
