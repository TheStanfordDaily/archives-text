Rev. Geo. C. Grift'en delivered the
sermon in the chapel Sunday morn
ing. His subject was "Labors of
God" taken from Corinthians, third
chapter, ninth verse.
In the Bible there is revealed to
us the co-operation of God and man.
It is true God created the world
without man's assistance, but every
where on earth since man's advent
into this world, liis creations are i
being enhanced in beauty and
grandeur. Bleak hills are turned
into paths, deserts into fertile val
leys. It is man who must bring the
seed to the soil. Piaiu as it is that
God has a purpose, yet he must
have human assistance. The high
est statesmanship, the truest loyalty,
is to seek the trend of divine will.
God takes us into partnership in
works of providence, redemption
and creation that we may become
acquainted with his methods, and j
be one harmonious whole.
