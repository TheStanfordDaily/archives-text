The course in economic geology
was completed to-day, and with its
completion we lose a gentleman and
an able teacher. Dr. R. A. F. Pen
rose, Jr., departs from our Uuivers
ity bearing the highest praise from
the students who have been taking
work under him. Ilis efforts Lave
been highly appreciated here, and
it is with regret that we take leave
of such a pleasant lecturer and noted
geologist.
