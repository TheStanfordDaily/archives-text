A humor to the effect that Mos
quito Lagoon will probably dry up
during the summer has recently
reached us. It is reported that Mr.
Shackleford has grave doubts about
the water supply being sufficient to
keep the lake full and irrigate the
fields also. We thought this ques

the boat-house was built. It will
be a great pity if, after expending
so much money and building such
pleasant schemes for the future, our
race course should be found per

next fail. Perhaps if the proper
steps are immediately taken by the
Boat Club, something may yet be
done to preserve our lake.
