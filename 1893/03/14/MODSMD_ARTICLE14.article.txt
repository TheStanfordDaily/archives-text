In regard to the recent content in
debute there have been very likely
many criticisms coming from both
students and professors. Looking
upon these as having been made
justly, what should be done to lessen
the number of criticisms in the future?
Would the problem not largely be
solved if a department of elocution
and oratory be added to the univers
ity? By oratory one does not menu
high-Mown oratory and the "sawing
of the air," but a manner of speak
ing that carries with it conviction.
In order to convince, the speaker's
style must be considered, as well as
the thought and arrangement. If a
student would carefully analyze
liiauy of ihrf speeches ui Webaiei,
Clay, and Calhoun, he could not
help being improved by it.
The question is, where and how
shall euch work be done? One pro
fessor remarked that cratorv was

similar to music in that it should
have do part in tlie university cur
riculum. If the college department
do not recogn'zi the need of a train
ing department in public speaking
and take steps to supply the need,
it cannot be expected that the con
tests alone or the meager literary
work done will be sufficient to turn
out such men as will be able to cope
with the graduates from colleges
that look well to these matters.
All recognize that there has been
an increased interest in literary mat
ters this .semester, ami the proposed
contest, between Stanford and Berke
ley will add to it. If a separate de
partment of oratory can not be es
tablished, would it not be a good
idea to have the best orator and de
bater of the faculty drill those who
are anxious to make improvement in
public speaking? It is generally be
lieved that such co-operation as sug
gested would produce excellent re
sults. Perhaps many are aware that
at Chicago next summer an orator
ical contest will be held, and it is
expected to have more than fifty col
leges compete. Stanford should be
represented, and more than that
should be prepared to take a high
rank.
