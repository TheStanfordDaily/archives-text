# Olymyic Club Athletics.

### 
The Olympic Club seems to Lave
been greatly stimulated by the sud
den rise of the two universities in
athletics. One of i's members said
yesterday to an Examiner reporter:
"I guess we'll manage to get
-along even without Berkeley and
Palo Alto. The chances are that
we will have two football teams, and
even then we will have good mater
ial lo Spare. It iÂ» nul generally
.known, but our men are practicing
every clay when the weather per
mits, and they are showing up in
line form. We are going to have a
coach soon, and Walter Camp is
looking out for one for us. We
may secure either Camp or Mc
ciung, but failing in that we will
have the best man money can se
cure. "With proper coaching our
men can defeat any team on the
coast. '

"Football will be but a side issue
so far as the club is concerned, and
baseball will be given a fresh im
petus. The Olympics expect to
have three nines at least, and they
will be prepared to wipe up any
thing in the state unless the rest of
the community, in its natural per
versity, refuses to be wiped."
