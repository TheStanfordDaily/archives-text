# College Verse.
## 
### 
We have had opportunity of late
to acquaint ourselves somewhat with
current college verse. If we were
to give our candid opinion
thereupon, we should say that the
greater part of it i-< hopelessly bad.
On the other hand, much of it is ex
ceedingly bright and entertaining.
As might be expected, the greatest
successes are in the line of humorous
poetry. The youthful American of
the present day is a humorous
animal. It is fin sicde to take a
somewhat playful view of life. The
serious side of human existence is
ea<-y enough to parody. One of our
excha' ges criticises, and with reason,
the attempt to portray seriously the
deeper emotions and experiences of
iife, with no guide but imagination.
Shall our efforts in the way of versi
fication then, be abandoned or con
fined wholly to lighter subjects?
Neither. We ate seeking to acquire
a liberal education. It' that bring
to us anything of worth, it should
certainly afford us a thorough know
ledge of our Euglish tongue, with
all its possibilities. It should famil
iarize us not only with the structure
of a superior prose style, but with
poetic forms as well
The present trend in English
verse is towards careful finish rather
than the development of striking
and original themes. There is no
reason why the college student, with
his supposed intimate knowledge of
polite literature, should not become
skilful in versification. While in
most cases it will be only a pastime
for his leisure moments, it may
nevertheless aid greatly in the for
mation of a good prose style. A
condensed form of expression, a
wide vocabulary, a store of etriking
and picturesque epithets, an easy,
melodious flow, artistic vowel-color
ing, a skilful balancing of light and
shade â€”these are the formal charact
eristics of poetry. Are these not
worth considering? Is it not worth
some pains to become a master of
the art of wielding words?
