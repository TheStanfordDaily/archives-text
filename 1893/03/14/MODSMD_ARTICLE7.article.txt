### 
Kute Field's Washington says in
regard to the acceptance by ex-Pres
ident Harrison of the non resident
professorship of international and
constitutional law at Stanford Uni
versity:
The youncr centleraen of tlm In
land Stanford Jr. University who
are to have the pleasure of listening
to law lectures from ex-President
Harrison will have a very unique
and fortunate experience. It will
add a new interest to di-tcourses on

constutional law to bear theui from
tbe lips of a man who has made
supreme court justices, and made
them well. Moreover, the ex-pies
ideut is an excellent speaker as well
as a learned lawyer, and if anyone
can make legal lore enjoyable as
well as profitable, it is he. Alto
gether the arrangement is a most
satisfactory one. We have long
held theoretically that the best talent
should be devoted to training the
next generation, on the same prin
ciple thar the farmer saves the seed
from the largest melon or the
heaviest squash for next year's plant
ing. In actual fact this theory is
rarely carried out; but the securing
of the ex-president by Stanford
University will add one more to the
short list of notuble exceptions.
