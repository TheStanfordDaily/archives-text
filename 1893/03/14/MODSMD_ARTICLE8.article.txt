professor to-day tLat Gordon McKay,
the millionaire inventor and manu
facturer, is the man who has left
between $2,000,000 and $4,000,000
in trust to Harvard University. One
of Mr. McKay's most intimate
friends is a Harvard professor who
is very popular and at the same time
very influential in educational cir
cles, and it is probably through his
acquaintance that Harvord will get,
at Mr. McKay's death, his entire
wealth. Mr McKay formerly lived
in Cambridge, and there he perfected
most of Irs inventions, such as the
McKay sewing machine, the heeling
machine, the stitcher, find the McKay
