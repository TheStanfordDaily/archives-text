# The 						Faculty's Tribute to Mr. W. H. Miller.
## 
### 
The Committee on Resolutions
begs to suggest to the faculty the
adoption of the following resolution:
William Howard Miller, Instruc
tor in Mathematics in this University,
died on the second day of March,
1803. During his connection with
the University he won the regard
and esteem of the students and of
the members of the faculty, and im
pressed his colleagues in the depart
ment of mathematics with a high
opinion of his mathematical ability.
He was a man of wide interests out
side the limits of his own specialty;
atul within his specialty he prosecu
ted his studies with unflagging zeal,
even when iu impaired health. The
firmness of his character is illus
trated by the fact that he carried on
his work long after his strength had
ceased to be equal to it.
The Faculty of the University,
therefore, hereby expresses its high
appreciation of the services per
formed by Mr. Miller to the Uni
versity during his lifetime, aud its
sense of the great lo ; s the Univer
sity has sustained iu his premature
death. J. S. Oyster.
