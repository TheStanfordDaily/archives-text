# Wood Engraving.

### 
The usual Tuesday evening lec
ture was given by Mrs. Comstock
on "Wood Engraving." On tli3 walls
of the chapel was displayed a large
collection of engravings, mo3t of
which are engravers' proofs printed ,
on Japan paper. There were sev- j
eral of those of Mr. Davis, who h
the center of the New York Society
of American Wood Engravers. The
Â° I
most beautiful were those of Mr.
King, the engraver of Church's
paintings.
The engraving is done on box
wood imported from Turkey in logs J
which are cut across the grain into !
small blocks. Many small blocks
make up a large one to prevent
warping. The picture is put on the
block by a drawing photographed
down to the size of the block and
'
. printed upon it. Tints and tones of
| the drawiug are conveyed by fine
I and coarse lines.
The first authentic wood engrav-
I ings appear in the fifteenth century
with a very crude form and little
! perspective. Wood engraving is
! the mother of printing. Albert
Durer, born in 1471, knew the value
of white and black. The wood en
gravings were made by drawing on
the block and cutting away from
the lines. Fora hundred years after
the death of Holbein, wood engrav
ing was thought to be a lost art.
Wood engraving is a relief pro
cess, the reverse of copper plate,
steel engraving aud etching, in
which the ink is pressed into the
incisions and afterward the plate is
wiped. In steel engraving the work
is very laborious. All pen draw
ings are generally reproduced by
photographic processes. The great
advance of printing in this country
has enabled the engraver to carry
out his ideals The printer must
be an artist. Every tone the painter
puts in his picture, the engraver
wdl bring out. We have to-day
two sorts of engravers, the sympa
thetic and the technical. The first
work from the inside out; they work
from the artistic side. In the second
class the engraver is a machine aud
not a creator. The black aud white
artist mu3t alwa}B give the color
values as well as tho s e of light and
shade. A color translation of a
produce the same
! feeling as the painting. In the best
| modern wood engraving the lines
I arc too dclicatc to bo seen. TLcy
are felt, not seen. A new art is
founded out of the old by perfec
tion of tone and graduation of color
values.
The engravings of the magazines
are printed from electro-types and

not from the blcck. The cost of the
engraving varies as the work done.
Magazines pay from two to four
hundred dollars a page according to
the woik done upon it. There is
hardly one illustrated magazine
which does not pay out two thous
and dollars alone for engravhigfe.
There is great value in the love
of an engraving. A single engraving
is more an educator in art than any
painting. It becomes your partner
inartistic thought and feeling.
