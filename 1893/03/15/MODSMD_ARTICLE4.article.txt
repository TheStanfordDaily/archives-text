The following circular Las been
sent to leading fruit growers and
others throughout the state inter
ested in entomology:
AN AFTERNOON WITH ECONOMIC ENTO
MOLOGY.
There will be a meeting held at
the State Board of Horticulture in
San Francisco on the afternoon of
March 16th, which should attract
the attention of all California horti
culturists. It will be a special meet
ing of the State Horticultural Society
in honor of Prof. J. H. Comstock,
entomologist of Cornell and Stan
ford Universities. Our older
fruit growers will remember that
it was Prof Comstock, at that
time government entomologist, who
came to our aid thirteen years ago
when exact knowledge concerning
the fruit pests which then menaced
our young horticultural industry
was in pressing demand. By per
sonal investigation and subsequent
close study he met this demand and
placed us under lastiug obligation.
His presence in the state at this time
led the members of the State Horti
cultural Society to decide upon a
special meeting at which attention
could be exclusively given to con
sideration of economic entomology.
We trust this opportunity will in
duce a large assemblage of all inter
ested in scientific aspects of horti
culture, for 1 he Horticultural Society
invites the public to participate in
the meeting.
By a fortunate coincidence Prof.
V. L. Kellogg cf the University of
Kansas is also in California, and will
accept a place upon the program cf
the meeting. |Prof. Kellogg is one
jof the newly appointed members cf
the Stanford faculty, and will begin
his work here next September as as
sistant professor in entomology.â€”
Ed. | He has given much attention
to insect-destroying fungi, and will
speak upon the influence which this
form of vegetation performs in re
ducing injurious insects.
The meeting will open at 1 o'clock
and continue during the afternoon.
Full opportunity will be given for
free discussion of the points Ad
vanced.
I E. J. Wickson, B. L. Lelong,
Secretary. President.
