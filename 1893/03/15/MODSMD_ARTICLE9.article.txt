The present stat-=j legislature in
session at Sacramento has voted to
change the site of the capital from
that city to San Jose, ami unless a
very improbable reconsideration of
their action takes pbee, the propo.
sition to make our nti^hboiiug city
of San Jose the seat of California's
law making will go before the people
to be voled on.
San Josa has for years claimed
many advantages for the location of
the capital, but never until now did
a favorable opportunity present itself
for making a successful attempt to
secure the coveted honor. The ac
tion was brought on and precipi
tated by one of Sacramento's leading
dailies, which is now thoroughly re
pentant, but to no avail, afte- hav
ing probibly caused its city a great
loss and incurred the avowed dis
pleasure of all its citizens.
The San Joseans are greatly
pleased aid are wildly demonstra
tive over the prospective influential
additiou to their city. It is not for
us to say why the change should be
made or why it should not be made,
or to advance arguments in favor of

tbe present or in favor cf tbe pro
posed bile for the capital. P>ut we
do see tLat certain advantages will
accrue to Stanford if tbe clief legis
lative sesions ia tbis state are beld
only seventeen miles from us instead
of a'out two hundred.
In the event of tbe removal of the
capital to San Jose, that city, which
already bus a greater population
than' Sacramento, would receive a
boom, and this locality with its edu
cational advantages and its nearness
to the great Pacific metropolis,
San Franc.sco, and Stanford, also,
by reason of her position directly
between tbe metropolis and San
Jose, would be visited more and
would become better known through
out not only the state, but the
whole coast, and tbe cause of higher
education would of necessity be pro
moted.
