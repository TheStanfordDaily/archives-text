# BASEBALL TO-MORROW
## Oakland Professionals and Varsity will Play on the Home Ground, Rain or Shine. 
### 
The preponderance of bad weather
for the past week has been a serious
drawback on the condition of our
baseball players. Yet the most
faithful ones have been doing regu
lar practice work in the gymnasium,
and can be expected to give a good
account of themselves on the field,
even if they do not hit the ball hard
in the first few games. Campbell is
in gocd c:ndition and it is safe to
assert that in spite of the increased
distance of the pitcher's box he will
continue his heretofore phenomenal
record.
Last night Manager Grove re
ceived a telegram stating that the
Oakland professionals would be on
hand to-morrow afternoon, rain or
shine, and would expect our team to
meet them. The baseball grounds
are now flooded, and the game will
in all probability be played on the
football field. Captain Walton,
having been sick for the past week,
can hardly be depended upon to
play, and it is likely that Davey will
be taken from second base and put
behind the bat. Davey is a good
change catcher and will give a favor
able account of himself in this
position.
A large crowd should attend this
game. First-class ball can be de
pended on, and the Varsity men
ought to be given all the encourage
ment possible. They have been
practicing under difficulties, and if
they do well to-morrow the success
of our team for the season is prac
tically assured. Seats will be pro
vided for the ladies. Game will be
called at half past two, rain or
shine.
The Oakland team defeated the
Berkeley's yesterday by a score of
oto 3. This is a remarkably good
showing for the college nine. They
have shown themselves weak in bat
ting, however, but if they improve
in this line as they have in fielding,
our men will have formidable op
ponents in the first inter-collegiate
game which is to be played April
Bth. The professionals played at
Santa Clara College this afternoon,
and will come up on ore of the
morning trains.
The same teama will play at the
Haight street grounds in San Fran
cisco Saturday, and it is hoped that
a large number of students will ac
company them. There are many
attractions at the theatres in the
evening, among which is ''Robin
Hood," at the Baldwin.
