Tee manager of Mile. Adile Aus
der Ohe is willing to arrange fora
recital to ba given by her at Stan
ford, early next week, if a sufficient
guaranty can be obtained.
Mademoiselle Aus der Ohe is per
haps the greatest living woman
pianist, and stands in the first rank
of arti√üts with Joi-effy and Pade
rewski. Several of the members of
the Faculty Musical Club, who have
heard her play in Boston and New
York, are enthusiastic in praise of
her wonderful technique and sym
pathetic interpretation.
Some haste is necessary in making
arrangements, as Mademoiselle Aus
der Olie gives her last recital in San
Francisco this week, and it is hoped
that al! lovers of good music will co
operate in signing the list* now
posted.
