Now that the challenge sent
1o the University of California has
been accepted, decided steps must
be taken this week towards the se
lection of debaters. Judging from
the answering nf t hp I'hH.llpngP,
Hastings L-iw School will be well
represented in the selection of speak
ers from the U. C. These young
lawyers who have been puzzling their

brains over tbe knotty questions of
constitutional and international law
will undoub'edly put up a strong
debate.
In locking horns with such a class
as Berkeley shall very likely choose
there is but one motive that should
Iguide us in ihe selection of the gen
tlemen who will represent Stanfoid
It is that we select the best debaters
in the University. Every man who
atte -, d« this University is eligible to
be a Stanford representative. Any
one can become a member of Con
gress who pays a small initiation fee,
and although Alpha and Eupbronia
have a limited membership, jet both
are anxious to get good men. There
are no doubt many here who have
taken no active interest in literary
work for one reason or another.
These men might be our ablest rep
resentatives, and they arj not doing
their duty by remaining in the back
! ground.
We would suggest there be some
form of test by which a committee
selected from the faculty should de
termine who the best men are, ir
| respective of whatever organization
to which they may belong. We
earnestly hope that every one who
takes an interest in the literary wel
fare of the University will look into
this matter carefully, and feel it bis
duty to make some self-sacrifices if
need be for the general good of the
University. Let there be a full attend
ance at the first meetings of the three
above mentioned societies, which
tave taken the responsibility of
representing the literary men of
Stanford.
