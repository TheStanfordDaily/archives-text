# The
						Zoological Club.
## 
### 
At the beginning of the year a
new club was added to the list of
our many organizations. At its
first meeting a president was elected
for the ensuing semester, and it was
decided that the association, to be I
known as the Zoological Club of
the Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity, should hold bi-weekly meet
ings, alternating with those of the
Biological Society.
The club has as its object a thor
ough survey of the vertebrate fauna
of this peninsula, and to facilitate
this result has been divided into
four departments; those of fishes,
of reptiles and batrachians, of birds,
and of mammals. Each of these de- 1
partments has elected a secretary
whose duty it is to record all obser
vations which the club shall order
preserved.
All members are expected to make
observations in the field and to
report upon them. The meetings,
usually assuming the form of gen
eral discussions of all points which
arise, are conducted in the most
informal mauner consistent with
success.
About twelve persous have been
in regular attendance at these meet- 1
ings; it is hopad that a larger num
ber of those actively interested in
zoology will appear next Monday in
tho pallors which Dr. Gilbert has
oftered as a meeting place.
Students who are not directly in
terested in this work often have an
opportunity to obtain animals, such
as lizards, snakes, birds, and mice,
and these would be of great value to
the club in the solutions of its prob
lems. All Hueh material mav be left
at the zoological laboratory, or given
to Dr. C. H. Gilbert, Mr. J. O. Sny
der, Mr. W. W. Price, or Mr. Van
Denburgh
