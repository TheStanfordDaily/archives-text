### 
The baseball game this afternoon
on the home grounds between the
Oakland professionals and the Vars
ity team was closely contested
throughout, the former dually win
ning by a score of 7to G. McLaine
pitched the tirst six innings for our
nine and held the professionals
down in fine style. Campbell
pitched the last three, and made
quite a record for himself by strik
ing out three men in succession.
On account of the balls being soft
and wet through, he had very poor
control.
Our boys played a good fielding
game and batted harder than was
expected, considering their lack of
practice. Sheehan and Kay es
pecially cracked out the base hits
when they were most needed
The Oaklands played a fair game,
with the exception of a bad error by
the third base man. They excelled
especially on the coaching lines, and
Tip O'Niel's voice as he yelled,
"Come! Come! Get down the line
now!" could be heard all over the
campus.
Colonel T. P. Robinson, manager
of the Oaklands, acted as umpire,
and filled the position in his own in
imitable style. A large, enthusiastic
was in attendance The full
detailed score cannot be given on
account of the paper's going to
press.
The Varsity nine leave for San
Francisco in the morning where
they play the Oakland professionals
at the Haight street grounds. The
making up of the team will be as
follows: Harrelson, 1. 112., Sheehan,
c. 112., Lewis, s. s , Walton, c., Davey,
2d , Ilay, 3d., Rear. 112., White, Ist.,
