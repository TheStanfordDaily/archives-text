In common justice to those sub
scribers to the football fu.ul who
have paid out their amounts, all
of those who are yet delinquent
should come forward and make good
the subscription set opposite their
names. Every one who placed his
name on any list certainly did so
with the intention of making good
the amount. In the rush of prepa
ration for the great game much that
was thus due was not collected, and
although a greater part of the
eigneis paid up, many failed to do
so. This may have baen because
they were not dunned for the
amount, or because they did not
feel that the money waß being ex
pended in the manner they should
desire. But whatever the reason,
no excuse ought to be given for an
obiiguiiou solemnly entered into.
Ts it just to the great bulk of signers
who willingly and immediately paid
what they had subscribed, to refuse
to pay a fairly contracted debt?
There ought to be no neud of urging

in this matter, but each person now
delinquent ought to feel it a duty to
square off tbe amount placed oppo
site bis name, placed there by each
one at the time with a full determin
ation and indention of paying
Expenses are heavy, certainly no
one is feathering his own nest, and
the fu'l amcuut originally subscribed
will be Leeded
