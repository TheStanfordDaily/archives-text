## 
### 
No one should miss the boat race
011 Ligunita to-morrow. Four
crews will contest fora pennaut
which has been presented by
some enthusiastic lady members of
the Boat Club. The shells are not
all of the same weight and the race I
consequently will be a handicap.'
The following crews are training and
expected to compete: Harvard, Yale,
Cornell aud Pennsylvania.
Harvard's crew is not decided as
yet, but will probably be Langford,
Morrow, Fraser and Archer. Lang
ford has been suffering from a severe
cold however, and may be thrown
out. This crew is at a traiuing table i
at Pa'.o Alto. The Yale colors are
to be carried by Hamilton, Brown,
Copeland and Burnett. Cornell's
crew is working hard and her sup
porters are confident of success.
C. Downing, Bancroft, Poindexter,
and Spauldiug are booked for the
3eats in that boat They take four
mile jaunts every day and are in fine
condition
Pennsylvania is said to ha\e a new
srhell, probably aluminum, which
will be put on the lake for the first
time to-morrow. No one but Pat
terson is sure of a seat in the Quaker
boat, but there are plenty of people
who are willing to back Pennsylvania
if Patterson has to row alone.
The course commences at the east
end of the lake and is straight-away
to the turn at the west end. This
brings the finish in front of the boat
house. Besides this race there will
be a dash race of a quarter m le be
tween '95 and '9(5.
