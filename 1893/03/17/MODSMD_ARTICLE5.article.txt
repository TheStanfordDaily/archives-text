# Miss Adele Aus Der Ohe
## 
### 
Those who are acquainted with
the reputation and ability of this
wonderful musician are making
strong efforts to secure her fora re
cital to be given at Stanford early
next week. It is not often that we
have this chance to listen to an
artist of ability, and many names
should immediately be signed to
tbe lists that are posted in the
registrar's office and on the bulletin
board in order to secure the neces
sary guaranty to bring her here.
To-day's Examiner contains the
following:
The audience who listened to the
playing of Adcle Au3 Dev Ohe in
Metropolitan Temple last night
seemed as completely under her
power as was the instrument of
which she is such a master, and she
moved the one just as she controlled
the other.
It is not often that any artist re
ceives such an ovation at the hands
of a San Francisco audience as was
given Miss Aus der Ohe last night,
but she deserved it. She interprets
her music with tbe soul of a musi
cian, and plays with a touch that is
firm and clear, and yet sometimes so
soft and delicate that the melody
seems floating in from some unseen
source.
The rendition of Schumann's "Pa
pllons" and Tausig's "Yalse
Caprice" was brilliant. The most
difficult passages were played with
surprising ease. And in Chopin's
'•Nocturne" it reminded one of the
description of how Rubinstein
played "Then it got dark and the
stars began to come out."
It was encore after encore, and
when the last number had been fin
ished the audience absolutely re
fused to go home until, after having
been recalled tbe third time, the
pianiste responded with one of Cho
pin's waltzes. The program was as
follows:
Toccata and fugue, D minor, Bach
—Tausig; sonata, F major, op. 10
No. 2 Beethoven; Papillon, op. 2,
Schumann; Chant Polonais, Chopin-
Liszt; four etudes, op. 25: No. 1. A
flat; No. 2, F minor; No. 3, F major;
No 4, It flat major; nocturne, B
major, op. G2—Chopin; Yalse Ca
price, Tausig; Rhapsodie Hongroise,
No. 12, Liszt.
