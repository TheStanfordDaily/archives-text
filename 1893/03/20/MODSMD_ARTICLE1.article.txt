# Field Day.
## 
### 
A large crowd attended the im
ipromptu field day held on the trot
ting track last Saturday afternoon.
A drizzling rain had been falling all
•day and not only caused a decrease
in attendance but also kept many
men from entering the events.
Promptly at 3 o'clock seven men
kined up for the fifty yards dash.
They got off well together and re
mained bunched until reaching the
finish, Woodward, '96, breasting the
tape first, with J. Reynolds, '96, and
Cr. Calhoun, '95, close upon him in
the order named.
Crane, '95, H. Reynolds, '96, and
•Condit, '95, entered for the pole
vault. All three showed good vault
ing form, but Crane won easily.
In the 100 yards dash J. Reynolds,
Vanderveer, and Bernard ran a close
•exciting race from start to finish,
Reynolds winning from Bernard by
■two feet. Vanderveer finished about
the same distance behind Bernard.
Leithold, '95, Pillsbury, '95, and
Salisbury, '96, started in the mile
run. Pillsbury dropped out at the
shalf pole and Leithold won the
a-aca, Salisbury coming out a good
second.
Timm, '96, brother of our crack
laaile walker, entered the walk and
won with comparative ease over
Ashley. Toombs, '96, won the high
jump. Orcutt, '95, won both the
shot put and the hammer throw.
Maynard, '94, and G. Calhoun,
''95, were the only starters in the 220
yards dash, but it was one of
the prettiest races of the day.
Both ran with good speed, Calhoun
winning the day with Maynard a
i3tieng- second Both men were in
poor condition, and weakened con
siderably at the finish.
The crowd had diminished to a
few entliusists by the time the last
ovents took place on account of a
Jieavy shower. Xo time was an
nounced on any of the runs, but it
dg safe to say that they were all
made in creditable time.
As the field day lad been post
poned for three weeks in succession
on account of rain, it was decided to
iiold it Saturday, rain or shine, in
order to give some of the new men
n chance to show what they could
do. On account of the informality
•of the affair no records were an
nounced on either the field or track
.erects.
