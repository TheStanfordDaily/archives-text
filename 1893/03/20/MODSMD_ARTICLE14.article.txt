The services in the chapel Sunday
morning were led by Prof. AG.
Newcomer. The subject was, "Amiel,
and Modern Unrest."
Amiel was bom in Gtneva in
1821, to whicb city bis ancestors bad
immigrated after tbe Edict of
Nantes. At tbis time Geneva was
made up of conflicting elements,
governed by an intellectual aristoc
lacy. At tbe age of twelve years
Amiel was left an orphan. His
nature was tinged witb melancholy,
and now left alone, be sank into
deep, sombre thought At twenty
one be entered on a literary career.
In bis first publication he doubted
the truth of religion, and questioned
whether it bad not been best to
have left the greatest problems of
li'e buried in the breast. He spent
six years in traveling ever Europe
He became more and more cosmo
politan. At Inst he took a chair of
philosophy in Geneva He was a
dry speaker; be had no magnetism;
yet his friends prophesied for him
great fame. 13ut he was afraid to
put his thoughts in words. He
leared be would be misunderstood,
and he thought it useless to try to
do in a world whe r e all was destined
to die He submerged himself in
resignation. His fume and influence
shrunk, and at last, after having
been forced through ill-health to
leave his work, he passed away in
silence. His friends mourned over
what might have been.
8o lived and died Amiel, but his
only confidant, his journal, lived
alter him Tt. has been published
and translated. It is hardly a bock
to prcduce a furor outside of France.
All biography is left out. It consists
only of scattered thoughts, grand,
sombre, aud clothed in beautiful

language. In it we find certain
notes which we designate as modern, j
self-torturing self-analysis. Joy is
followed by dejection. He has the
sharpest sense of the emptiness of
life and of things, *.112 the nothing- 1
| nets of our joys and a universal
weariness overshadows all. Ail Lis
energies stand para'nzed before the
infinite.
Optimistic moments come. No- j
thing matters. What is (o be will j
be, and all for the best. It is little
better than fatality. He who wills ■
what God wills avoids catastrophe.
There is an underc-ry through all.
What use is mortal endeavor when
naught but the infinite and eternal
remains. "We work because we can
not help ourselves. We work to
satisfy an inborn craving. It
explains why we work, but not to
what end. We live here and now,
and if we can find a reason here, let
us look no farther. W T e recognize
temporal goods, pleasure, happiness,
and the like And how do we know
but that some day we will be faced
by our works, not as temporal, but
as eternal.
In Amiel we see the distinctively
modern type. The old gods were
not made for men. Under them,
men bent their whole energies to
perfect living. The Hebrew God is
not so self-sufficient. Mau is im
mortal, eternal, divine. Man is at
best but a link in some chain or
other. Of eternity, nothing is
learned. Man is left to contend
with fate alone. No hope, once
entertained, is given up without a
struggle. Work, Help and Love
will save the world alone.
