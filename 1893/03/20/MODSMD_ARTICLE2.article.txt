# On Lagunita.
## 
### 
At 2 o'clock Saturday afternoon a
crowd of umbrella carrying students
•gathered on the bank of Lagunita
collected about tbe new boat
house to see the first race ever
rowed at Stanford. Tbree boats

started in the first event. P. Down
ing, '95, and Frankenheimer, '96,
were in one boat; Bancroft, '95, and
Poindexter, '96, were in another
bout; and Patterson, sp., sat all
alone in the third boat. The race
was laughably exciting and was won
by the solitary rower who came in
way ahead at the encouraging yell
of "Pat," "Pat," from the banks.
The next race was virtually a test
of oarsmanship between '95 and '96.
Kennedy and Patterson in one boat
and Copeland and Hamilton in an
other boat represented '95, while
Timm and Barr bent to their oars
for '96. Just as they came up
abreast the starting point and a sup
pressed silence had settled upon the
crowd a tremendous crash accom
panied by a pandemonium of yel's
and shrieks went up from the boat
house. The incline leading to the
float had broken in the middle and
over forty students were plunged
down into the water in the wildest
confusion. As soon as it was seen
that no one was hurt, and the ludi
crous sight of men trying to collect
their hats and umbrellas and get
ashore as fast as they could scramble
over cach other through '.he shallow
water became evident, a continuous
roar of laughter went up from the
crowd. The race resulted in a victory
for Kennedy and Patterson in be
half of '95.
