# No Game Saturday.
## 
### 
Tlie Varsity baseball team went
to San Francisco Saturday to play
the game scheduled with the Oak
land professionals. The weather
was threatening but the boys put
on their uniforms and went out to
the Haight street grounds in the
afternoon, expecting the Oaklands
to meet them. They spent some
time in practicing on the wet dia
mond while waiting for their op
ponents to come. Finally Captain
O'Neil of the Oaklands appeared
and stated that there would be no
game as his men had remained in
Oakland, thinking it was too wet
to play. He said it was raining
hard across the bay. So the few
spectators in the grand stand were
dismissed and the game declared off.
If the weather becomes favorable
again, the Oaklands may comedown
here next Wednesday afternoon and
play another game with us. Our
boys wore their new uuiforms for
the first time while practicing Sat
utday. They are a little darker and
more grayish than the old uniforms
and have "Stanford" in cardinal
across the breast. The sweaters are
very handsome. They are cardinal
colored with collars and a
white "S" on the left breast.
