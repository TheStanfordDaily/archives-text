# A
						Social Event in Alvarado Row.

### 
One of the most enjoyable enter
tainments and certainly one of the
most unique yet given on the
campus, was the progressive obser
vation party given Saturday evening
by Mrs Braly at her home in Alvar
ado Row.
The test of the observing powers
of the fifty or sixty guests, among
whom were both students and mem
bers of the faculty, was the ability
of each person to detect hidden ob
jects by their smell alone; to record
a long list of small articles on a table
after being allowed to look at them
a brief half minute; and, while
blindfolded, to name things by feel
ing them; to taste correctly liquids;
and identify solids by their taste.
After the trial was over and the
guesjfe had tasted and smelled
enojj&h of the mysterious and the
unfiiL'.iliar to be appreciative of what
was if ally appetizing, they were
served with ices and other refresh
ments. The small part of the even
ing that remained' before midnight
was spent pleasantly in conversation,
and the prizes were awarded, the first
prizes to Miss Evans and Mr. Rice,
and the booby prizes to Miss Pack
ard and Mr. Trumbo
