# The 						Entertainment Friday Night.
## 
### 
A fairly well-filled chapel greeted
the Misses Calhoun of San Fran
cisco in their dramatic reading of
selections from "Much Ado About
Nothing" and"The Rivals." The
latter selection was particularly well
rendered. During the intervals be
tween the readings, vocal and instru
mental music was furnished, by
Miss Carrie McClellan of San Fran
cisco, who sang two pieces; by Miss
Flora Kendall, who rendered two
selections on the piano; and by the
Roble Guitar Club, which played
one piece. The members of the
Guitar Club are Misses Lyle (pic
colo), Coombs (mandolin), Rose,
Chapman, and Penniman (guitars).
As a whole the entertainment was
not very good and did not hold the
interest of the audience. Half the
door receipts go to the Roble read
ing room to purchase books for the
young ladies' library.
