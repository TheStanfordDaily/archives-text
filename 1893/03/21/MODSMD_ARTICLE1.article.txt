# The
						Boat Club.

### 
Active operations are being made
in view of a race with Berkeley some
time this year. A commodore will
be elected in a few days and ail can
didites for the crew put to work on
the machines in the gymnasium. Of
-course nothing can be done toward
get ing training barges and pleasure
-boats until the necessary money has
been raised. The management is
rising all its energy in this direction.
The faculty has been called upon
and some have generously responded
and it is hoped that others will yet
do so. An entertainment will be
given this week for the benefit of
the club, and it is hoped that a large
attendance will ensure its success.
Last Friday at the meeting of the
Board cf Directors it was de
cided to ask aid of the trus
tees of the University, and a
committee was appointed to draw up
a letter of petition. The generous
action of the alumni and regents at
Berkeley will, it is hoped, act as a
stimulant for inducing the trustees
to give us their much needed aid.
As soon as it is known exactly
liow much financial support may be
expected from this quarter, the
board will purchase two four-oared
training barges and as many pleas
ure boats as the funds justify. The
boats will probably come from
Michigan, as it is found that letter
boats can be got there for the
money, freight included, than can
be purchased on the coast. A good
•coach will also be engaged and a
training tab'.e provided for the can
didates for the crew.
There seems to be an opinion
•abroad that the finances of the club
are rather loosely managed. This
is erroneous. The finances of the
club are handled in a thoroughly
accurate manner. The following
are extracts from the constitution of
the club: "All matters of finance
shall be in the 1 ands of the board
of directors." "It t-hall be the duty
of the treasurer to collect and hold
all money coming to the club. He
shall make a general report to the
•club the fiist regular meeting in
each month; and an itemized report
the last regular meeting in Novem
ber and April. lie shall disburse
money on the ortler of any member
of the board of directors counter
signed by the chairman of said
board." The board of directors has
also instructed the t-easurcr to pub
lish in the college papers on the
first of each month an itemized re
port of the affairs of the club. And
these rules are strictly adhered to.
From this it will ba seen that the
club is laid on a thoroughly business

like foundation. Knowing that
other branches of college athletics
have had this slur of unbusiuess-like
management cast upon them, the
founders of the boat club took par-1
ticular pains to make the club an
entirely separate organization and i
not in any way connected with the '
general athletic management.
The eight hundred dollars which
Senator and Mrs. Stanford so gener-;
ou?ly gave the club for an eight-!
oared shell will for the present lie
in the treasury, for it will be a good
while before a crew can bs fitted for
fchell rowing. Geo. J. Bancroft,
Chairmau Board of Directors.
