It is with sincere regret that we
learn that the engagement with Miss
Aus der Ohe Las failed. The reason
is n'ot far to seek. We all seem to
be in a sort of stupor in regard to
entertainments in the musical line,
and thus let a good fortune pass us
unnoticed. Although it is to a
great extent our own fault, yet we
can not hut think that if those in
charge of the entertainment had
made a little greater effort to adver
tise it among the students and pro
fessors it would have met with
greater success.
Owing to the philanthropy and
thoughtfulness of one of our pro
fessors, Paderewski's managers have
been written to in order to secure a
date for his playing at Stanford Uni
versity. Now there are obvious ad
vantages in our having him here, be
sides the pleasure and education
One of these is that the attendance
at a concert here has not at all the
uccessoiy expenses indispensably
connected with such an entertain
ment in a city. Any student can af
ford to go at le.ist once a year !o
hear such a player, and if probability
becomes a certainty in regard to his
coming, let all signify at once their
hearty support. And right in this
connection we can not help but think
that if the students themselves would
do something to stir up a taste and
desire for music in their midst it
would add inestimably to the social
side of life at the University. Music
will lend romance to our lives here
that are in general so prosaic.
In many universities they have
choruses of student, voices. These
choruses range in number from sixty
to two hundred. We have the ad
vantage of many universities in hav
ing the help of the young ladies, and
with the co-operation of all we could
have a first class chorus. There is
plenty of music in this line and of

the best quality. A leader could be
obtained from the city to comedown
once or twice a week at very little
expense to each member.
There are enough good sing*-â„¢ in
our midst to secure succe.-s in this
line, and let all those who can read
mu6ic at all and have any sort of a
musical voice be ready to fall into
line with this movement. Let us
not permit this matter to drop here,
but let all that have any university
spirit take it in hand and at once
employ measures to cany this or a
similar scheme into execution.
