# The 						State Capital Again
## 
### 
Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
I noticed with some surprise the
position taken by a paper of
the moral standing of the Daily
Palo Alto in Thursday's issue,
in regard to the removal of
the state capital. The question,
ur'\er ordinary circumatances,
would be one merely of choice of
location, but with the present con
ditions a change of the capital would
be merely a bid for corruption.
The politician who views the wel
fare of the state through the smoke
and fumes of some water-front gam
bling den has in the past had alto
gether too much to do with Cali
fornia politics. Ido not think that
the people of California are going to
vote for the continuance of such
corruption by sustaining a few dis
soluble legislators iu their petty
schemes for vengance.
"What California wants first is
better men in her public offices and
better men to make her law 3, then
if a change of the state capital is
needed there will be ample time to
consider it A Student
Feosi Another State.
