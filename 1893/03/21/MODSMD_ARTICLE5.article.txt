The motion carried at the last meet

was reconsidered and it was decided

lines. A ballot was taken and
Messrs. Bannister, Barnhisel and
Gruwell being the three receiving
the highest number cf vote*, were
declared elected to debate with the
Berkeley men.
Mr. Hughes, who was chosen to
confer with the representatives from
Berkeley at San Francisco last Sat
urday, uiade his report. He stated
that it was decided to hold the de
bate at San Francisco on the even

the day that the field day with
Berkeley will take place at the
Olympic grounds and it is expected
that more students will be likely to
attend the debate then than any
other time. The hall for the de
