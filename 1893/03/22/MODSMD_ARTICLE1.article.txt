# An English Philanthropist
## 
### 
The usual Tuesday evening lecture
was given by Prof. Amos G. Warner
on the subject of "An English Phil
anthropist."
The seventh E trl < 112 Shaftesbury
was a man of a most philanthropic
nature. He was intensely interested
in the improvement of the social
condition of the working classes,
his efforts in behalf of whom have
made his name a household word.
His first speech in Parliament was !
for the regulation of lunatic asylums,
which at this time were in a most
deplorable state. The most brutal
treatment was received by the in
sane, and for years Shaftesbury ex-;
erted all his strength in checking :
the cruelty of those in charge. At
last, in 1815, certain bills were
passed through his efforts, known
as the "Magna Charta" of the in-J
sane.
For seventeen years oi his life he
stood out for factory legislation. â– 
John Fright and Gladstone were
among those who bitterly opposed
this interference of sta'.e in private
enterprise. Thousands of children
under thirteen years of age, in the
most abject poverty were compelled
to work from twelve to fourteen
hours a day in the factories of Eng
land. Though au ardent church
man, Shaftesbury received but little
help from the clergy in any of his
philanthropic work.
Ia ISBI through Shaftesbury the
till was passed preventing the em
ployment of children under sixteen
years of age in chimney sweeping.
The part which he took in legislation
bearing on coal mines was equally
as prominent. It is worthy of no
tice that his efforts in behalf of the
practical welfare of the working
classes were guided by his own per
sonal knowledge of their circum
stances and wants.
A mining act was passed which
prohibited underground work to
women and to children under ten
years of age. Shaftesbury was presi
dent of several philanthropic institu
tions and religious societies of Lon
don, and in him we recognize the so
cial value of self sacrifice.
In this, our own country, we find
work fora Shaftesbury. In the
mines of Pennsylvania we find chil
dren not unlike the mistreated
children of the coal mines of Eng
land, and in the tenement houses of
every great city we find children as
abject as the little chimney sweeps
of London. In many asylums, were
close investigations made, we would
find cruelty and maltreatment.
There is yet philanthropic work
for all.
