The criticism of last nkbt's lec
turer was a jus': rebuke to rowdy
ism and eellisbuess. To a lecturer
of any nervousness to see a number
of persons intent upon everything
else but bis woids, must be humili
ating and aggravating. We do not
tbink much further need be said on
tbis subject for surely university stu
dents are thoughtful enough so that
if they have been guilty of disturb
ing anyone and their attention has
been called to the fact, they will be
more considerate in tbat direction
thereafter. But while on this sub
ject, without desiring to offer a high
school criticism we would suggest
that in no way can one display self
ishness in such a marked manner as
they may by engaging in conversa
tion and laughter during a musical
performance. Probably on account
of thoughtlessness this aggravating
way of spoiling others' enjoyment
has been shown in the chapel on
several occasions and we take tbis
occasion to hope tbat a repetition
will not be indulged in when those
engaged in it understand how much
aggravation they cause those around
them.
