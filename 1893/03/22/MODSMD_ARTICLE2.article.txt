# Report of Mayfield Branch of Stanford Y. M. C. A.

To subscribers and others interested:
At the time the pledges for the
first year's work were made, a quar-l
terly report was promised to show
what was done. Below I have tried
to give as clear an idea as possible
without goiDg into details. The
books and records are open for in
spection by any one who cares to
examine more in detail.
A committee of seven members of
the University Association was ap
pointed by Pres. W. G. Johnson
about Dec. Ist, to assist Mr. Janes,
county secretary, in raising the
funds, and to have general charge
of the work under his supervision.
$271 was subscribed by the members
of the faculty; $75 by the parent
association; $55 by students inde
pendent of the $75; and the remain
der, $431, by the people of Mayfield.
This makes a total of $831, of which
$195 has been collected.
The only suitable building avail
able at the time of opening was one
which had been promised fora
saloon, but after considerable labor
we obtained a contract giving us the
building for one year at $20 per
mouth, which was reduced to $15 a
few weeks later, because of fixing up
the rooms.
The following is the financial state
ment :

We have an average attendance in
the rooms of thirty-five. The last
three evenings of the week the av
erage attendance ii about fifty, there
not being so many the first three
evenings.
A gospel meeting is held every
Sunday afternoon, and a short
prayer service each evening before
closing at ten o'clock. One recep
tion has b:en held, which was well
attended, and more are planned for
as often aa we have time to prepare
them.
It would be an especial help to us
if the $100 which is needed could be
pledged before Friday of this week,
in orJer that a complete ieport may

be made at the Los Gatos conven
tion. It need not be paid until later
in the year fcr some of the expenses
which come later.
The committee consists of A. R.
Sawyer, chairman; S. G. Bailie, sec
retary; L. M. Burwell, treasurer;
Rev. W. W. Thoburn, W. J. Neidig,
J. A. Gunn, Jr., and E. L. Rich.

member of the committee.
