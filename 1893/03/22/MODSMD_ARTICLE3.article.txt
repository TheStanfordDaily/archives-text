# Olympic Field Day.

### 
A large number of men have en
tered in the Olympic Club Field Day
to be held next Saturday on the
clubs grounds. Eight Stanford men
eutered iu the events, and it was ex
pected they would receive fair s : zed
handicaps because of the bad training
facilities here. When the handicaps
were published this morning, how
ever, it was found that Fry and
Orcutt were the only men who were
at all satisfied. Woodward and
Maynard fared the worst, the former
being placed on the scratch in the
120 yards dash, and Maynard was
given a two yard handicap iu the
300 yards run.
