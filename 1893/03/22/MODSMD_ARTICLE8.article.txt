A permanent joint debate league
is being discussed by the dailies of
the University of Michigan and the
University of Wisconsin. The idea
is a good one and we should like to
see it put into operation here on the
western coast. Debating is without
doubt assuming a prominent place
in all universities, and at the pres
ent time there is as much a demand
for in'ercollegiate contests in debat
ing as there is in football, oratory,
etc. The practical side of this man
ner of contest is plainly evident to
outsiders, and puts the University
closely in touch with the practical
tendency of the present. We hope
that the debates between our Cali
fornia institutions will go off in a
manner that will suggest at once the
advisability ot making such an oc
currence an aunual feature of the
friendly rivalry between the two
universities.
