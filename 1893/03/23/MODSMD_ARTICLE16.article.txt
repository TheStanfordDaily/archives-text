'1 lie following words of advice on
training which appeared iu tbe last
issue of the Brrklyan are well worth
being considered by the men now in
training heie:
" 'Gym.' work should be taken
every time you train, and special
work for Fpecialties is necessary,
upon which Mr. Magee can advise
all. Special care should be taken
about starting before sufficient train
ing has been done to harden the
muscles. Do not try to do too
much in a day, but be regular and
work every day. Another thing
just here let me say, do not trv to
do everything, boys, for there are
only a few of us who can do every
thing well. A great fault of many
beginners is that they spend too
much time training. They go on
the track and don't go at once to
work, probably stand around and
get cold before they go at what they
should.
"Oft' of tbe track care in dieting
is a good thing some say, but very
few do much of it because, probably
on the whole it does not pay for the
trouble. lingular hours and absti
nence from liquor and tobacco will
do more than all the dieting in the
world.''
