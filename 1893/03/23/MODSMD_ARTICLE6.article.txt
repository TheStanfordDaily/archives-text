# Belmont Notes.
## 
### 
It looks at present as if there
would not be much baseball here
this year. The school has not gi\en
the nine much support thus far, and
the diamoud is in a wretched con
dition. It is also getting very near
the end of the year, and the bojs
started to practice so late that they
are beginning to think that it is not
worth the work of practice from now
until May, considering the few
match games they would be able to
play.
About two weeks ago a case of
measles was discovered in the
school and since that time eleven or
more of the fellows have come down.
Thi3 time last year there were about
twenty-one cases here.
The new gymnasium has beer,
finished, but the apparatus will not
be put in until the summer holidays.
( The boys expected to give a dance
in honor of the occasion, but it has
been postponed on account of the
nearness of reception day.
The Alhambra Theatrical Co. will
give a couple of short farces at Red
wood on April 28th, after which
there will be dancing. This is tie
first time they have ever playeJ out
side of Belmont.
