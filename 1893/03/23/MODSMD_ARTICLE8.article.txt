# Yale and Harvard Challenge Oxford and Cambridge to Row in America.
## 
### 
Harvard aud Yale have combined
and challenged Oxford and Cam
bridge to row in America. The only
thing which will now prevent a row
ing match between the winner $t
the Harvard-Yale race and the vic
torious English crew is the refusal
of the latter to row.
There has been a great deal of talk
concerning such a race for several
years, especially at Yale. The ini
tial steps were taken several weeks
ago when the representative of Yale's
boating interests &ent a communica
tion to the Harvard authorities ask
ing if Harvard men would agree that
the winner in the race between the
two colleges should be pitted against
the victcrious English college. Har
i vard's reply was favorable aud a
meetiug was arranged, which took
place at Spriugfield recently.
The committee, after talking the
matter over, sent over two letters,
one to Oxford and the other to Cam
bridge. The letters stated that Har
vard and Yale thought the present
year would be a good one for an in
ternational race, ia view of the
World's Fair and the international
yacht race, and the English uni
versities were asked if they would be
willing to row two weeks after the
Yale-Harvard race, which will prob
ably take place on the 13th of June.
If the race takes'place it will prob
ably be at New Loudon, on account
of the good course at that place aud
other conveniences, such as observa
; tion trains, etc., which could easily
be provided.â€”Cornell Sun.
