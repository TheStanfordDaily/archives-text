# GAME WITH SANTA CLARA.
## The
						Varsity Wins by a Score of 9 to 3. 
### 
Though the weather was very
threatening yesterday afternoon, the
Varsity baseball team took the
chances of being rained upon, and
went to Santa Clara College in one
of Paulsen's buses. When they ar
rived at Santa Clara the rain had
ceased falling and the baseball
grounds at the college were in fine
condition.
The game was called shortly after
two o'clock on the college grounds.
The Santa Clara team appeared in
splendid form and played an ex
ceedingly good game. Quite a num
ber of errors were made by both
sides, but few of them were costly.
The double plays were a remarkable
feature, there being no les? than
five, four of which are credited to
cur men. This is a great change
from the record of last year, when
our team went through the whole
season without making a single
double play.
Bruschi, the Santa Clara pitcher,
did some good box work. lie is a
small man only, but lie has tremen
dous speed. Flannery on first put up
his usual errjrless game, and Bliss
at second accepted all his chances
with scientific precision. Heffron
did some star backstop playing and
was very effective in his swift throw
ing to bases. Kelly did all the
heavy batting to amount to anything
for his team.
Our boys showed a marked im
provement in some respects in their
fielding. They had more life than
heretofore this season, and put some
spirit into their work, as the double
plays will testify. Lewis did the
best work on the in-field. Sheehan
played third fairly well, considering
his lack of practice in the position.
One of the features of the game was
the daring base stealing and eliding
of Calhoun.
The boys nearly all batted well,
Walton and Rea earning oft' the
honors in this respect. Following
is the ecore:
