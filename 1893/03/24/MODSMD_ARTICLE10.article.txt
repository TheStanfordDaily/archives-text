# The
						American Crew will Challenge the English.
## 
### 
Yale and Harvard have at last
agreed to send a challenge to the
winner of the Cambridge-Oxford
race, to row the winner on this side
at New London two weeks after the
great race here. It looks now as if
Yale would have all the glory of
representing American colleges in
boating, if the English crews should
accept. The men on the Harvard
crew are at present rowing in poor
form. Professor Trowbridge of the
physics department, writing to the
Ila rvard Crimson this last week,
made some interesting and valuable
suggestions on the subject. He
urged some plan by which a pro
fessional trainer could be hired,
whose sole business should be to
coach the crews, who should study
the rowing systems in England and
America, to find out the merits and
defects of all systems. He also pro
posed that the college should go
about the matter in a thoroughly
scientific way, and by the aid of
delicate apparatus, which could be
constructed, and by the aid of pho
tographs and the like, efforts should
be made to discover just what meth
ods would produce the greatest
effect.
