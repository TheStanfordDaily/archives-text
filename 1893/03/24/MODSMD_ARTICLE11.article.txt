# Maps of the Western Coast
## 
### 
Mrs. Barnes has just bad arranged
for tlxe library quite a number of
tracings of maps now in the Harvard,
Cornell and Sutro libraries, relating
to the western coast. These tracings
are of interest to students because
they bring out the ancient mythol
ogy, ami because references to the
Strait of Anian, to Fousang, and to
New Albian are made. Besides
these tracings there are also some
maps of 1820 to IS4B inclusive,
interesting because on them are
shown the territorial boundaries,
settlements and trails as existing in
the west between the dates men
tioned. A curious addition was
made to the list by Dr. Fluegel,
being a Uermen map of 18-4G, with
the Girman idea of the western
coast.
