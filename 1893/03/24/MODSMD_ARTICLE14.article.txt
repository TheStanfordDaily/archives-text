The reception given to the upper
clas&es last evening at Lauro Hall
deserves especial mention. Such
events are featuxes of college life
that do more good than so much
dull routine study. Entertainments
and receptions that bring together
the classes cultivate sociability so
essential to success. Thus far there
have been few events of thin kind
and it is to be hoped that wore will
follow.
