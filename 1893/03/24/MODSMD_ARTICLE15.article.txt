The warm hospitality extended
our baseball team while at S.iiita
Clara College yesterday afternoon,
showed in its fullest light the
friendly relations of the two institu
tions, and can only be fully appreci
ated by those who were fortunate
enough to enjoy it. The fathers
entertained the boys with unequalled
joviality, and the students in their
turn applauded the different plays
irrespective cf the side making it.
Such friendly relations with our
sister institutions promote not only
the welfare of athletics, but add in
a great degree to the influence and
good name of our University.
When the Santa Clara boys appear
on our diamond shortly, let even
one turn out and give them a recep
tion th. t will reciprocate in a small
way at least their generous treatment
of yesterday.
