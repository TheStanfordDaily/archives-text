The joint debate having been ar
ranged and the speakers selected,
much of the responsibility fora suc
cessful issue ot course remains with
our representatives, who, we feel
satisfied, will well represent us.
Now while these tbree men take
charge of the joint debate, what will
the other literary men do? Many
suggestions time and ngain have
bfeeu made legal ding uu oiatoiical
association, yet an organization has
not been perfected till to-day.
It may be a little late, but if it be,
past negligence can only be made
up by each one doing his duty in the
future. A temporary organization

has been perfected and each one
who has any idea of taking part in
this coming contest —for there must
be one soon after the recess —can be
getting his oration into shape. Let
all who have any old orations on
hand remodel them or prepare new
ones during this week, so that at
the beginning of the next term an
oratorical contest can be arranged
in the early part of the term.
