# The
						Tennis Tournament.
## 
### 
Negotiations are low pending
with Berkeley iu regard to the an
nual intercollegiate tenuis tourna
ment, but no definite arrangements
have been made. The rumor that
the Perkeley people were not train
ing for tennis which appeared in the
daily papers recently has been denied
by the Berkeley college papers.
The committee on tennis of the
Athletic Directors decided to hold
two tournaments in April. The
fir?t will be the doubles and will
take place on the 15th. The second
will be for singles and will be held ;
on the 20th. So fai the weather has;
not been very satisfactory for the
men interested in tennis to train.
As many as possible should enter
these tournaments in order to have
a good team to meet Beikeley.
