The baseball team has been doing
i-oiue hard i raeticing during the
past vacation and are already in
good.trim for the big game next
Siturday. Several, new candidates
have made their appearance and are
working hard to secure places on
the te:m. It is most gratifying to
note the interest manifested by sev
eral members of the faculty who
came out on the diamond regularly
last week in order to make enough
men to practice. Their good will is
heartily appreciated by the boys
and their presence, wilLout a doubt,
causes b.ttcr work.
The men will 1 e kept busy for the
rest of this month if all the games
scheduled are played. Thursday
the Santa Clara College team will
appear on our grounds for the first
time this year. They have almost
an entirely new team this season but
have shown up well and are playing
the best kind of ball. An enthusi
astic crowd will greet tffem on their
np|,e nance.
Ntxt Saturday the liisi game of the
Stanford-!!. C. series will be played
in San Francisco. No special train
will be run, but a large number of
entl usiasts will accomp my the team.
