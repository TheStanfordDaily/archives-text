The showing made by our athletes
during the Olympic field day augurs
well for the future. Energetic work
on the part of those who are to enter
in the inter-collegiate contest to take
place April 2'2nd will assure us at
least a good showing, and under the
circumstances that is all that can be
expected. However, it must not be
forgotten that those who finally are
chosen have the athletic reputation
of the University to sustain, and
they must leave 110 stone unturned
to put themselves in fine form.
Work and hard work will do won
derful things.
