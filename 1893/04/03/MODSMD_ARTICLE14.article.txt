It was understood before the va
cation of lust week that as soon as
University work opened again im
mediate steps would l>e taken to
ward tbe formation of a dramatic
club. We desire to urge that there
be not a moment lost in tbe matter.
Despite tbe fact tbat loyalty to our
University ought to keep every one
here through commencement week,
many students nre already planning
to leave earlier. These people can
most all be kept here if proper in
ducement is offered in the way of
entertainment, and the week can be
filled with entertainments if the
proper spirit be 3bown. Let then
a good dramatic club be immedi
ately put on foot and let us have two
first-claßs dramatic pieceß duiing
commencement week.
