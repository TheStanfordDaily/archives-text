# "At Home" Days.
## 
### 
Below is a list of the days on
which the different persons named
receive calls from their friends. This
is by no means an exhaustive list,
nor does it mean that the days
named are the only occasions on
which students and faculty may
call. In general, the members of
tho faculty and their wives are
pleased to receive callers on any
day. The "at home" is not a restric
tion to callers, adopted to prevent
tho continuous and overwhelming
duties of social life, for the mad
whirl of society does not disturb
the domestic quiet of the campus
community, but it is a measure cal
culated to encourage occasional
sociable gatherings which eventually
lead to greater intimacy and friend
ship.
