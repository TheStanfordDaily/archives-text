Editor Daily Palo Alio:
We feel tliat in a'hletics as in
every other department of Univers
ity work, sterling moral worth must
go hand in hand with ability No
man should be given a place on any
of oui athletic teams who cannot be
trusted when away from home to
maintain the reputation of the Uni
ve*sity. College atheletics will be
come a by-word if the moral senti
ment tf the student body is not
strong enough to force off of any
athletic team men who have not
enough manhood to refrain from
doing that which will bring dis
honor to the good name of the Uni
versity.
This demand upon all members
of college organizations becomes
stronger when said members are
bound by pledges. If a man has
not enough manhood to be bound
by sentiments of loyalty to his uni
versity, at least he should have
enough honor to keep inviolate a
pledge. Let us right now firmly de
cide as a collective student body
that no man shall be tolerated on
any athletic organization who has
not the instincts of a university stu
dent and a gentleman and let us call
to account all managers of said or
ganizations who do not immediately
remove a member falliug short in
this particular. This might be
made stronger but we feel that a
mere suggestion is all that is needed
at the present.
