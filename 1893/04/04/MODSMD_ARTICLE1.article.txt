# ATHLETIC RECORDS.
## Our Standing as Novices Compared With Organizations of Long Athletic Experience and Training. 
### 
The date of the first intercollegiate
field day between Stanford and the
U. C. is less than three weeks dis
tant. As every one in the Univers
ity feels some interest in the show
ing the Stauford team will make, we
publish a list of the collegiate ama

teur records together with the Pa
cific coast amateur records, not to
make a comparison which seems
very unfavorable to ourselves but, in
a certain measure, to anticipate any
dissatisfaction which may arise when
the result of the contest shows, as it
cannot help but show, that Stanford
has not yet attained that ability in
track athletics which comes from
long practice. In football, in base-

ball, and in tennis we have proved
ourselves superior to the IT.l T . C., but
these events do not require several
years of careful and systematic indi
vidual training such as is an abso
lute necessity to proficiency on the
track.
The coast records represent the
best accomplishments of the best of
several hundred athletes during a
long period of years. The intercol
legiate records of the United States

stand for the greatest proficiency of
the best athletes among several
thousand men who have exerted
every eftbrt to attain athletic profi
eippry. Thp Stanford rfifiorda, made
last year, on a poor track with scarce
a fortnight's training, represent what
the best fitted of about a 6Core of
contestants accomplished in the first
unsettled year of the University's ex
istence While they are in most

eases not the best accomplishments
of the men who made them, and arc
not anything to be proud of, still
they ate better, with only a few ex
ception, than the intercollegiate rec
ords of 187f>, and, in every instance,
with the exception of the 100 yards
dash, we are informed, are better
than the collegiate records of the
state of Indiana, which contains
nearly a dozen colleges.
Some of the Stanford records
which have been bettered since last
May are the 220 yard dash, by G.
Calhoun who made it in 23| sec.;
the 440 yard dash, by Rea Maynard
who made it in 54 sec ; the high jump,
by Scott Calhoun who cleared 5 ft. I
0 in.; the shot, by Orcutt with 35 ft ;'
the pole vault, by Crane with 9 ft.
11 in. None of these stand as Stan
ford records, however, yet they show
that there is ability for great im
provement even where little practice
has been taken. "With a good track
and a year's experience Stanford
may hope to show up as a strong
da k horse in the contest for the
coast championship in 1894, but for
the present too much must not be
expected from unfavorable circum
stances.
