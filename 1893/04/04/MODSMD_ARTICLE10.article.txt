## 
### 
A member of the faculty has just
received a letter from President
White, who is now at St. Petersburg
as minister to llussia. The letter is
dated March 13ih; in it he says:
"Please give my best regards to all
my old friends at Palo Alto, 'lhere
is some difference between this cli
mate and the one I was enjoying
just a year ago on the Pacitic coast.
We are now in our seventeenth week
of steady sleighing, during which
the thermometer has risen but once
above freezing point, remaining there
but a single day."
