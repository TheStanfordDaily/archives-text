# Lessons in Elocution.
## 
### 
Mr. S. S. Ilamill gave a very inter
esting talk last evening on elocution,
lie showed what a lack of knowledge
of the elements of elocution is found
throughout the land. The entire
attention in the schools and colleges
is devoted to the training of the
mind in the solving of problems,
while the proper use of the voice
aud manner of delivery is entirely
ignored.
After a pleasant talk Miss Ilamill
delivered"The Bugle Call" in a
most finished manner and answered
to a hearty applause by a second
equally charming selection.
A course of ten lectures in which
the principles of expression will bo
taught, which, if carried out by the
student, will be all that is necessary,
will be given for the following
prices: A class of thirty cr forty
members, $5 a member; eighty or
one hundred members, a member;
a class of more than cne hundred,
$2 a member.
