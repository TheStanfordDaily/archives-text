Recently several periodicals have
been surreptitiously taken from the
library reading room, and some of
the pages of others have been muti
lated. If this is not stopped the
papers and magazines will not be
placed on the shelves for public pe
rusal, but will be issued to individu
als in the aarue way that books are
now. This surely would be a very
great inconvenience, but it seems to
be the only way to preserve the li
brary property for the use of the
student community, unless the
guilty person reforms his ways. The
student body should for their own
good adopt some means of appre
hending and exposing persons who
are the cause of such trouble and
destruction.
