Last evening was the date for the
regular monthly meeting •of the
Board of -Athletic Directors, but
only half the requisite number of
members fora quorum put in an ap
pearance. Although much business
needed attention it inu?t lay over till
the president can call a special meet
ing. This action is unpardonable.
The members of the athletic board
were elected to carry ou the athletic
business of the whole student body,
and they would confer a great favor
upon those elected them by at
least attending the meeting. They
should know by this time that the
regular monthly meetings of the
board are heUl on the evening of the
first Monday of every month. When
they fail to attend meetings at this
time of our athletic season it mani
fests a lack of responsibility and
sense of duty which deserves the
condemnation of the entire student
body.
