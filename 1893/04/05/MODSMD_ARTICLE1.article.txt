# BASEBALL AT SAN MATEO.
## The 						Varsity Plays an Errorless Game. 
### 
San Mateo Beaten By a Score of 13
to 1.
Clad in their filming sweat- rs the
members of the baseball team set out
for San Mateo yesterday noon to
cross bats with the team at St.
Matthew's llall. The weather was
perfect for baseball, and the new
diamond at St. Matthew's Hall was
in excellent condition, but was a
great deal too fast for the infielders
of the San Mateos to handle the hot
drives sent at them by the Varsity
batters. Davey did the catching for
the former team and made a good
showing throughout the game, scor
ing, through good hitting and dar
ing base running, the only run of
the San Mateos. A feature of the
game was the base running of Lewis,
who has four stolen bases to his
credit.
Although there were no really dif
ficult chances to accept, still our
men deserve credit for the clean field
ing iuyesterday's game, which was
played without an error. This is a
record to be proud of, and shows
what the boys are capable of doing
when given decent grounds on which
to play
The San Mateo team was entirely
too light to oppose the Varsity team
successfully, but in the person of
Edwards, their short stop, they have
a valuable man. He is a good hitter
and a reliable fielder. Wood was
substituted in the hex by Ouimette
in the seventh inning.
liussell distinguished himself at
the bat, making three safe hits.
"Walton hit well and was deprived of
a long diive to center by the good
catch of Abramsky, who played ex
ceptionally far back when Walton
came up.
The game was full of ginger
throughout and furnished excellent
practice for our boys. This game,
with the one to-morrow with the
Santa Clara College team on our
home grounds, ehouM put the team
in good condition for the U. C.-
Stanfoid game to be played next Sat
urday in San Francisco.
After the game the team was
treated to supper in the mess hall be
fore returning home. Every eftbrt
was put forth to make the visit a
pleasant one, and it is to be hoped
tLat we shall have a chauce iu the
near future to reciprocate the favors
done. Following is the score:
