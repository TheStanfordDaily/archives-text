Nothing has been said lately about
tbe oratorical contest. Has the
matter been dropped, or is the delay
caused by the committee who are
working the affair nj ?
Some sort of an organization
should be gotten up that would be
permanent. As long as tbe arrange
ments are left until late in the year,
so long will the contest fail to
amount to much. To make the
contest of value to tbe contestants
and to make the nflair one of the
events of the year necessitates a
long preparation for thoie who enter.
Unless a definite time is set and
definite regulations are laid down,
how is any one going to prepare a
year ahead of time?
