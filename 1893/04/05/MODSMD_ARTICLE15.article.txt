The athletic contests between
Stanford and tbe Univeisity of Cal
ifornia have heietofore, with but
one exception, been characterized
by upright dealing on both sides.
This exception was the game of
baseball played at Han Jose last
May, in which the U. C. manager
blackened the fair name of his insti
tution by playing five professional
men. This fact was well known to
all, but the Stanford men went into
the game rather than disappoint the
assembled crowd. As might have
been expected from association with
this disreputable crowd, the game
came near ending in a disgraceful
row.
As a result of this striking ex
ample it was not deemed nccessary
even to guard against a like occur
rence this year, but among the list
of U. C. names received by Manager
Grove last week is one which should
be summarily dealt with. It is that
of Cooney, pitcher of the St. Mary's
team Inst year. Even if C'ooney had
registered at the Univ.rsity of Cali
fornia some time during the present
year, he was not a member of that
institution in good standing on the
dite of signing the intercollegiate
agreements. The nction taken by
the U. C. management in presenting
hi<. name is a surprise to every one,
but it is hoped that the afl'a'r will be
settled with due respect to the rights
of each university.
