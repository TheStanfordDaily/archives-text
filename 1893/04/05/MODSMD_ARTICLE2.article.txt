# Baseball To-Morrow
## 
### 
The game to-morrow between the
Varsity ami Santa Clara College
teams will be called at 2:15 sharp.
Every effort should be made to en
tertain the visiting team to the best
of our ability. It will be interesting
to know that Captain Walton will in
all probability play the same men
against Berkeley that compose the
team to-morrow.
