Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Is it a fact that some one on the
Stanford baseball team played in
the professional game between the
Oaklaud and Los Angeles teams?
If this is a fact does he hereafter
retain his standing as an amateur
athlete? 1 ask this in view of the
fact that there was some trouble
made over "that San Jose football
game." in uhich some who played
were compelled to return their share
of the gate receipts in order to main
tain their athletic standing here at
the University. J. 31.
