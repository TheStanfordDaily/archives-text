# Woman and the State.
## 
### 
The usual Tuesday evening lect
ure was given by Prof. F. C. Clark,
whose subject was, "Woman and
the State." He divided his dis
course into two parts, treating of
woman's rights in the state and the
best method of gaining that right.
Society is the highest organization
we know, subject to the laws of
evolution. Society, based on gov
ernment. is called the s'ate; society is
not masculine, hence state should
not be. There is no referring to
color, size, or sex in the definition of
the state. Should sex then give rise ;
to demarcation which authorizes one
pait to dominate over the other?
Government derives power from
all. Might has been the perpetuity
of the state, hence ciedit to males.
It is illogical to bar out woman from
government and education on the
ground of might. Physically she is
admitted to be inferior to man, but
she is his equal in mental faculties.!
Woman is recognized in society and
so she will be instate. She has a
natural fundamental right to the
elective franchise. At present she;
stands bound hand and foot by un- |
just laws. In Massachusetts it took
eleven years for her to gain a right
to her own clothes. Taxation with
out representation is admitted to be j
tyranny, yet in all states where wo- j
man is allowed to hold property she
is taxed equally with man
State is not complete without wo
man's sagacity aud intuition. Wo- j
man stands demanding political r v c-:
ognition, and she already occupies a 1
prominent place in the world.
Church cannot be maintained with
out her, and journalism has been
much improved since her admission.
She is not forcing herself forward;
she is growing upward and outward. j
The movement is hastened by higher
education.
Woman is yet deficient in accu
racy and ability to shift her point of
view. In 1840 Oberlin, with one
exception, was the only college open
to women, but in 18 f JO there were
six hundred. Thirty per cent, of
the students of Stanford are women.
Thirty years hence woman will
have demonstrated her rights. One
will then be condemned for an opin
ion against woman. Already she
shares the echool franchise in many
states, and in Kansas the municipal
franchise. Woman hinders herself
by inactivity. She is not doing all
she might for her advancement We
need efficient men and women to fill
offices. The whole question is one
of growth.
