## 
### 
At a meeting of the university
council of Columbia on March 21st,
the university fellowships were
awarded. These fellowships, twenty -
four in number, carry witli them
$500 each. They are not given for
professional or technical work, but
each fellow must devote himself to
a course of -study leading to the
degree of Ph.D., and cannot be oc
cupied with any outside occupations.
There were 123 applications, repre
senting nearly every college of
prominence in the country. Of
these sixteen were for work with the
faculty of pure science, thirty-five
with the faculty of philosophy and
sixty-seven with the faculty of po
litical science. Six of these twenty
four fellowships were assigned to
applicants in political science. Of
these six Stanford got two, C. E.
Chadsey in finance and history, and
\V. J. Hanna in social science.
This speaks well for the University
in general and the departments of
history and economics in particular,
demonstrating that we have some
recognition in the east.
