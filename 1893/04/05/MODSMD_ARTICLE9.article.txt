# Berkeley Declines.
## 
### 
Mr. Bancroft, President of the
Boat Club, recently met the author
ities of the Berkeley Boat Club and
as lie had been instructed by the
board of directors, challenged them
to a four-oared barge contest this
spring. The Berkeley men declined
to row, stating that owiug to the
track and baseball they would bo
unable to prepare fora race so soon.
They suggested a race about Oct.
21st. This date meets with little fa
vor here- So much of the energies
of both universities will then be ab
sorbed by football that a race would
be poorly supported financially nnd
otherwise.
This decision of the.Berkeley men,
therefore, postpones the race fora
rear. An endeavor is being macie
to place some light pleasure boats
on the lake.
