# Berkeley Will Not Row.
## 
### 
A committee went over to Berk
eley last Thursday to arrange a four
oared race with the* University of
California. Nothing was accom
plished, however, for the Berkeley
students are opposed to rowing this
spring. Their session ends on May
Ist, and on this account tbey would
be unable to get a crew in training.
They would like to row us in an
"eight" next fall. Little encourage
ment was given this proposal, for
we do not desire to have rowing con
flict with football, so it is not prob
able that we will meet Berkeley on
the water till a year from this spring.
We should not on this account
give up our interest in rowing. The
greatest enthusiasm is manifested by
the students of Berkeley in this line
Fully one-half the financial support
of the boat club, or about #700, has
been received from the students in
actual attendance. Here, on the
contr ry, only about 8100 has been
subscribed by students.
The Boat Club is sadly in need of
funds. With a few hundred dollars
now we can put the club on its feet,
and collcge rowing on the coast will
be an assured thing. If you have
joined the club pay up your entrance
fee. If you have not joined, give
your name to Mr. Seailes the secre
tary. There is needed all the
aid and encouragement possi
ble to push the club forward this
year. Next year we can make money
from the races, for we will probably
row beside the narrow gauge mole
and charge admittance to the mole.
Now is the time to start the club.
A little training and racing this
spring will be worth everything to
us next fall. With 8500 we can get
a four-oared barge and a four-oared
4-hell, and these will always be useful
as training boats. Every "two and
a half" helps. If you do not care to
join the club, show your interest by
giving something towards getting
boats. Mr. G. H. liazzard is the
treasurer. Any member of the
board of directors, consisting of Dr.
Wood, Dr. Angell, Prof. A. W.
Smith, Miss Merritt, Messrs. J. F.
Wilson, (_'. L. Clemaus, and George
J. Bancroft will be glad to furnish
Â«ny information about the Boat
Club.
A committee composed of Clem
ans, Maynard, and Bancroft went to
the city during vacation and suc
ceeded in raising 8110 by subscrip
tion from the trustees. This is a
material and much appreciated aid.
We shall write to the trustees who
do not live near here, and we hope
that they will follow the generous
example of those in t!.c city.

Mr. Bancroft also made arrange
ments with Mr. Stanbury, the cham
pion scul'er of the world, to come
down and give us a few pointers as
soon as we get on the water.
A letter has been received from
the Olympic Club proposing a four
oared race with them this spring.
This would be a good thing for us,
for it would give us more knowledge
of boats and boating than we would
gain in a year without such a race.
We certainly shall row tLem if we
can raise the money. Pay up. Pay
up Don't forget the regular meet
ing on Thursday the loth.
Geo. J. Bancroft, Pres.
