# Yale-Harvard vs. Oxford.

G. (I. Hosmer the professioual
oarsman in commenting on the
method of rowing used by the Eug
lish and Ameiicans says:
Their system of training is much
the same as that iu vogue at Har
vard and Yale, only that the English
oarsmen take considerably more road
work, which may be accounted for
by the fact that they also take a
much larger quantity of ale, which
necessitates additional work.
I have paid much attention to the
coaching system iu practice at New
Haven, and I fail to see any system
better than that employed at Yale.
Wliile Mr. Cook makes no claim to
originality he has nevertheless im
proved on the English stroke, which
he introduced in this country sev
eral years ago. To my mind the
Yale oarsmen pay a tritle more at
tention to form than is observed at
Oxford, and I see a marked improve
ment in the recovery, something very
essential in crew rowing.
I have sepn nothing on the other
side of the water that would lead me
to believe that our boats are in any
way inferior to those on the Thames.
The rigging of eight-oared boats in
both countries is radically different
but there is not the slightest doubt
iu my mind but we are many years
ahead of the Britishers in ibis re
spect. To begin with, the Oxford
and the Cambiidge crews do not row
with their seats over the keels as our
crews do, but the men are seated
much the same as in Boston working
boats, the starboard and port oars
men sitting apart, outward, and
much nearer the gunwales.
