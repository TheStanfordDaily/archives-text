We are glad to note the stand
taken by the Berkeley faculty regard
ing baseball players, and hope our
University will never be compelled
to put up a game against hired pro
fessionals or any other players not
regularly registex*ed in the university,
when we are supposed to be playing
an intercollegiate game Our faculty
and students took this stand for pure
college athletics in such a decisive
manner last ye.tr that we need have
no fear regarding our own future po
sition on this subject. If we are
always met by Beikeley on ti.e same
ground, we can set our eastern
friends a splendid example of uni
versity athletics uninfluenced by a
tinge of trickery or professionalism.
