A communication from Bancroft,
president of the 13oat Club, appears
in this issue. The fuct that there
will be no intercollegiate rrce should
not, as he says, interfere with imme
diate steps to put the Boat Club on
a firm footing. A good stÂ«rt now
will arouse the interest and enthusi
asm that will be so much needed
next summer to ensure success. If
a race can be arranged this spring
with the Olympic Club, we are so
much the better off in the matter of
training, and strong efforts should be
made by the student body to give
that material aid to the club which
will secure the necessary boats. Ef
forts should indeed be made to se
cure a number of pleasure boats, for
we feel sure that in the end tbey
will prove quite a paying invest
ment. It bbould not need much
urging to bring to the mind of each
ore tbe obligation he is under ;o put

Lie shoulder to tbe wheel ami by a
membership in t! e Boat Club to
give our boating interests a good
start. Every subscription helps.
