# An Interesting Exhibit.
## 
### 
The local chapter of Kappa Alpha
Theta is having prepired a neat and
interesting contribution to the frat
ernity exhibit of the World's Fair.
The display embraces four transparen
cies with dimensions of about 9xl2iii.
Three of them are representations
of the different parts of the quad
rangleâ€”one of an arch, one of the
arcade, and one a bird's-eye view.
One photograph was taken after a
rain, and the transparency is a most
unique and beautiful ore. The
fourth representation is of the chap
ter's home. '1 he exhibit, while be
ing quite a neat one and reflecting
credit upon the chapter, is also quite
a nice mode of bringing our Uni
versity into prominence before those
who are so much interested in uni
versities generally.
