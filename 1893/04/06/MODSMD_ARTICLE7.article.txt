The World's Congress Auxiliary
of the World's Columbian Exposi
tion Las been provided for the pur-1
pose of securing proper representa-;
tion of the intellectual and moral
progress of the world, this represen- 1
tation to be made by the assistance
of the leaders in all the chief depart
ments of human achievement. This
auxiliary provides for congresses in
nineteen departments, and also in
the several divisions of these depart
ments. The department of litera- j
ture, for instance, includes the
general divisions of libraries, his
tory, philology, authors and copy
right, and folk lore. The congresses
of this department will commence
on July 10, 1893, and extend
through the entire week.
It is interesting to know that in
the congress of the world's his
torians, into which the annual meet
ing of the American Historical
Association will be merged, our
University is to be represented.
Prof. Howard has received an invi
tation from the executive committee
to be cne of the few distinguished
histoiical writers who are to prepare
and deliver papers on some subject
of their own selection. This is a
high tribute and a just one to the
ability of Prof. Howard.
Besides papers of this sort, any
historian in the world is free to Land
in contributions: for which a commit
tee has been appointed whose busi
ness it shall be to select from these
a number of the most suitable for
reading.
In the department of moral and
social reform, Prof. Warner of our
University has been chosen secretary
of the congress on charities, correc
tion and philanthropy, and as soon
as his university work is completed
here, leaves for Chicago to assist in
completing the necessary arrange
ments.
