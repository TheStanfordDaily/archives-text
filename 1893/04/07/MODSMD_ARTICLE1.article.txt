# THE 						LAW DEPARTMENT
## What Courses will be Offered Next Semester. 
### 
This will be a regular department
of the University. The general re-J
-quirements for admission to the Uni- j
versify will be demanded of the stu
dent taking auy of the courses, j
The student may make law his ma- j
jor subject; and, at the completion
of five hours of recitations a week
together wilh ten hours of recita
tions in other subjects, during four
years, will be granted the degree of
A. B. The work will be in charge
of Non-Resident Professor Harri
son and Professor Abbott.
As will be announced in the new
register, the ultimate aims of the
•departneut, when fully developed,
will be (1) To furnish such instruc
tion in the elementary principles of
Anglo-American law as may properly
form a part of the education of an
American citizen; (2) To furnish
such instruction in commercial law
as may be adapted to the needs of
those who intend to become mer- (
chants, bankers, brokers, etc , or to
follow other lines of business; (3) To
provide for students intending to
-enter the public service, adequate
instruction in public and interna
tional law; (4) To furnish to stu
dents of political and social science,
training in special branches of law
related to such subjects; (5) To pro
vide for the study of jurisprudence
as a science and therewith of legal
history and legal institutions; (GjTo
furnish to students intending to
adopt law as a profession a complete
and thorough course of instruction
which shall fit them for practice in
any of the American states or wher
ever the common law of England
prevails.
The work, therefore, when fully
developed, will include a wide range
of studies. While it is yet too early
to make a definite announcement of
future courses, it may be said that
instruction will be offered in the
English substantitive law, including
the law of persons and personal
rights with the special limitations
growing out of infancy, coverture,
incorporation, etc. The law of prop
erty and of property rights, thj law
-of commerce and of commercial and
business relations, and the special
jurisdiction of the courts of equity
and admiralty; in the law of proced
ure and evidence in all the courts;
in constitutional and international
law; in legal history and institutions;
in legal bibliography and legal ma
terial; in the civil law; and in gen
eral and comparative jurisprudence.
Such courses will be added from

year to year as the needs of the de-;
partment and the number of in
structors may warrant.
In addition to the courses which
will form the undergraduate work of
those electing law as their major
subject, it is expected to provide
fifth year or graduate courses espec
ially adapted to the needs of those
who intend to enter upon the prac
tice of law as a profession, thereby
enabliug a student to complete in
five years a thorough course in law
in the same way in which he is now
enabled to complete a course in any
other specialty. Such courses when
announced will be strictly graduate
courses and will be open only to j
graduates of this University or other
similar institutions.
It is not thought desirable that
any student should devote all his
time to the undergraduate courses in
law, unless he is already a graduate
of some college or university.
Special students in law, other than
graduates, will be received only
upon the most rigid test as to their
fitn.ss to undertake the work, in
cluding in all cases a satisfactory ex
amination in entrance subjects 1, 13,
| 14, and 15.
The courses announced for 1893-94

groundwork of all the special'zed
