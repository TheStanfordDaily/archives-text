# To Our Alma Mater.
## 
### 
As long as sunstt roofs of red
U't'bang thy long arcades;
As long as blue skif s overhead
Span all thy collonades:
Thy court with winter's sun aflame,
0. filled wiih summer's haze,
So long. <) Stanford! will thy name
Call f-nlh our songs of praise.
Chorus —With one accord we'll ting,
With love our voices ring,
Let every breeze
Sweet melodies
Our Alma Mater bring.
As long as live oaks dot the plain
And scatter o'er the hills;
As long as meadows touched with rain
The golden poppy fills;
Or visions fair thy vistas frame
Of mountain peaks and bays,
So long, 0 Stanford ! will thy came
Ring out in songs of praise.
Chorus —
As long as speech can tribute pay,
Or streams to ocean run,
Or love in human hearts hold sway,
Or shadows own their sun;
As long as youth will dream of fame,
Or nights dream of the day,
So long, 0 Stanford! will thy name
Be heard in songs of praise.
Chorus —
