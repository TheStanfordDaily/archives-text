# The 						Two Mile Bicycle Race.
## 
### 
Four or more Stanford men will
ente>' for the two mile bicycle race
in the inter-collegiate fieLl clay.
Tliey arc Alexander, Baistow, G. A.
Clark, and Edwards. Alexander
and Edwards are both fast and ex
perienced riders and can without
difficulty cover the distance in less
than the United States inter-colleg
iate record of 5:47 provided they
have a good track to race 011. CI. A.
Clark entered the inter collegiate
race in New York last year but met
with an accident and did not finish.
Barstow has had no experience as a
racer but he has taken many long
hard trips over the country.
The Pacitic coast bicycle record
for two miles is 5:24, and was made
by Osen, whom Alexander has
beaten in races of various distances,
but has never met in the two mile.
The Olympic oval cinder track is
six laps to the mile and, while it is
the best sprinting track on the coast,
it is not at all fitted for fast wheel
ing. The curves are too short and
tco nearly level. A bicycle race on
such a track is not necessarily to the
fastest man but is to the one who
can most successfully take the curves
without lunning oft'.
It will be pee.n from this that Stan
ford has what might be called a
"cinch" on the bicycle race if our
men can compete on a good track.
Further, there is a good chance of
our men taking not only the state
inter-collegiate and coast record but
the United States inter collegiate
record for this event.
Now, what should be done is to
have the bicycle race held on the
Alameda bicycle track, where the
affair will be a race and not an ex
hibition of fancy tiding. In justice
to our men an effort should be made
to give them a favorable opportunity.
