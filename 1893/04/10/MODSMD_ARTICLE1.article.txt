# STANFORD WINS EASILY
## The 						Inter-collegiate Gams Poorly Attended but Well Played. 
### 
Walton Carries Off the Honors.
The firs*- of the fieri.s of inter
collegiate baseball games was played
last Saturday afternoon at the
II tight s reet grounds iti Sau Fran
cisco. Notwithstanding the fact
that Berkeley had Cooney, her non
resident professor of baseball, in the
liox, our team won handily by the
score of 12 to G. The game did Lot
begin till hite, as much time was
taken up in protesting against the
playing of Cooney. fowever it was
not thought fair to disa: point the
thousand or m re spectators who
had assembled in the stands, so it
was liu illy decided to play rgiiust
Cooney under protest. The weather
vas perfect for ball playing, and the
grounds were in good condition.
Berkeley went first to the bat. In
the first time innings she failed to
tcore, but in the fourth managed to
pile up four rots. Morse and
llarmes reached first on errors by
Ray and Lewis and the bases were
filled on a hit bv Simpson. Galindo
followed with a single, scoring
Morse. Pierce forced lSarnies at
the plate and Cooney struck out,
leaving the bases full. Browning,
the next up, cracked out a lucky hit
to right which caromed off Pauley's
feet, and while he was trying to find
the ball in the grass Simpson and
Galindo tallied. Bernheim brought
in Pierce with another hit and the
inning was clo:ed by Browning
biing thrown out at the plate while
trying to score from second.
The only other inning when
Berkeiey scored was in the eighth,
when two more runs were made on a
base hit by Simpson and errors by
Lewis and Pauley.
Our bovs scored one run in the
first inning by a base on balls, anil
eirors, and another in the second by
a two-bagger by Ilarrelson and a
muff of Walton's loLg fly by Morse.
In the fifth two more tallies were
aided. Shechan aud Lewis singled
and were brought home by Walton's
double. This tied the score, amid
gieat excitement. In the seventh
Lewis was given a base on balls, and
scored on "Walton's home run.
When our boys came to the bat in
the eighth inning, tne score was
tied, G to G. Then it was that they
arose to the emergency aud showed
what they could do in the noble art
of batting. With one man out,

Ilarrelson aud Sheehan went to first
on balls. Then followed in rapid
succession a triple by Lewis, a
double by Waliou, and singles by
Davy, Russell, and Campbell. When
the inning was over we had twelve
runs to our credit, and the game was
won beyond a doubt.
The Berkeley boys played a mod
erately good fielding game, and it is
due to our team's superior batting
that Berkeley did not make a better
showing. Browning, Bernheim,
and Simpson all batted well, though
some of their hitting was of the
scratch order. Cooney pitched only
an ordinary game. He showed none
of his o'd time speed which he ex
hibited here last year when pitching
for St. Mary's. *
Walton carried off the honors for
our team both at the bit and in the
field. He caught perfectly, and has
a home run aud two doubles to his
credit. Campbell pitched a good,
steady gmne, and kept the hits well
scattered, though on account of a
lame back he was unable to do the
work of which he is capable.
Davey played the best infield
game, and tiarrelson and Sheehan
both caught well in the outfield
Lewis did some heavy batting, but
his throwing was poor. Russell did
not have many chances at first ba-e,
but he showed a fatal indecision ;.t.
one or two critical points. He needs
more practice in his position. All
the errors made on our side were
very costly, as will be seen by the
fact (hat. Berkeley has no earned
runs. Following is the score:
