The matter of having the bicycle!
race on the Alameda track was thor
oughly discussed and it was found
impracticable to thu3 divide up j
events, as it would necessitate the !
presence of all the officials at both
places. Thus it could not be held
at the same time with the other
events. If it were held the day pre- 1
vious the officers could not all be
present. All things being con
sidered carefully, it wa3 thought
to make no changes.
The following rule was adopted tc
govern the hammer throw: Each
contestant shall stand between two
parallel lines two and one half tect
ai art and in delivering the hammer
shall be allowed to step backward :
within the limits of said lines with
either foot, the other remaining sta
tionary. But the contestant must
deliver the hammer fairly* over the
shoulder without a turn If in de
livering the hammer the contestant
steps over either line it, shall count
as a trial without result and three
such failures shall debar the con
testant from further trial.
Beikeley holds its annual field
day ne.\t Wednesday and will open
any two events to the Stanford stu
dents that they may desire. A cor-,
dill invitation is extended to our!

boy*. to compete and, as entries will
not close until the event is called,
there should be several of the boys
go up from here. This would afford
us the best imaginable practice for
the inter-collegiate games and the
boys should avail themselves of tho
opportunity.
