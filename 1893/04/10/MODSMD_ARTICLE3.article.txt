Rev. Mr. Merrick of Sacramento
delivered the sermon Sunday morn
ing. Ilis subject was "Character
Building." He took Ids text from
Corinthians 1., 3rd chapter, tenth
verse.
The character that ought to be
built is a god-like character. Help
fulness and faithfulness should be
its foundation; supporting courage,
cheerfulness and self-control. Many
think they haw the latter, but when
the temptation comes it is found
wanting. It takes time, toil aud
tribulation to build n god-like char
acter. Slowly we learn that divine
love builds up Character is all we
can take with us into eternity. If
you be upright you will uphold the
upright in everything. For over
two thousand years the Egyptian in
scriptions remained undeciphered.
Does it not teach that God is in no
hurry? A thousand years to Him is
but a day. We must not hope to
learn all in a short time. Nearly
seven centimes ago the Milan cathe
dral, with its fifteen hundred spires,
was commenced. "What can not the
Creator build who eternity to
build in? He who seeks to build
without the divine aid seeks in vain.
