The poor policy of the San Fran
cisco Call in allowing a U. C. man,
Cerf, to write up the account of the
Stanford-U. C. baseball game
played last Saturday, is somewhat
surprising, to say the least. The
account is a one-sided, poorly writ
ten article, which ?hows too plainly
that the author is not only ignorant
of the national game, but is also
sadly deficient in his college eurricu
lum.
