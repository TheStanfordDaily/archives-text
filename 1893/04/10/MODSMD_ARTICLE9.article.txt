After en joying ft short but lively
boom, the Boat Olnb ban relapsed
into a stagnant existence. Simply
because Berkeley has played the
baby act and refused to row ns this
spring is no reason why all interest
should be withheld from this im
portant branch of our University
athletics. Proficiency in rowing
requires hard and continued prac
tice, and the surest way to beat
Berkeley, if we do meet her on the
water nest fall, is to get boats and
put the candidates to work im
mediately.
