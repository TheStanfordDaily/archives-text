Next Thursday afternoon at tie
trotting farm track a preliminary
field day will be held to determine
who are tit to participate in the in
tercollegiate field day. The team
will be chosen Friday, and it is de
sired that as many persons as pos
sible take pait in.this preliminary,
so that a good selection can be made.
AVe need men to enter the hurdle
races, particularly, and any one who
has the welfare of the University at
heart should not be backward in
participating and trying fora place
on our first track athletic team.
Captain Fernald has chosen able
assistants who can give advice to
those desirous of participating, and
we also have with us now Peter
Mclntyre, of the Olympic Club,
who is one of the best timers on the
coast, and is a person well fitted to
give advice to athletes
As yet, entries for the limning
high jump, running broad jump, and
the two hurdle races are very scarce,
and we need men to enter these if
they have any ability at all
