Mr. Edward Hulme, who is now a
student at tbe Iceland Stanford Jr.
University, has wiitten the libretto
for an operetta, which is to be set to
music by Paolo La Villa, of New
York. The operetta is entitled
"Fragoletto," and the lyrics of Mr.
Hulme have been highly spoken of
by several New Yo*k critics. Mr.
Hulme is well known in musical cir
cles in Portland, having sung lead
ing rcles in several cperas at Mar
quam. Signor La Villa has com
posed two grand operas—one in
three acts entitled "Nenka," founded
on an episode in tbe life of Byron in
Greece; tbe. other is "Tbe Duke of
Ebro " Extracts frcm the latter were
performed at the Handel and Ilaydn
festival at Boston in ISBO. His
mass in C major was performed at
Cbickeriug Hall, New York, in 18SG,
and afterward in St. Patrick's Cathe
dral. Tbe operetta above mentioned
will be produced in New York under
the personal supervision of Signor
La Villa, and it is not altogether im
probable that Mr. Hulme may pro
duce it in Portland.—(Jregoniau.
