# Electives at Yale.
## 
### 
The number of elective courses at
Yale lias been greatly increased.
The whole number of courses offered
in the prospectus of 1893 and 1894
is 147, against 12S last year and 120
the year before. The following list
gives the number of courses offered
in each group of studies and the in
crease over last year's list: Philoso
phy 13, increase 4; political science
and law 7, increase 0; history 10,
increase 2; modern languages 24,
increase 2; English literature 12,
increase 0; ancient languages 20,
increase 2; Biblical literature 10,
increase 2; the fiue arts 4, increase 3;
physical science 20, increase 7;
mathematics 1, decrease 1; music 3,
increase 0; total 147. It will be
observed that the largest increase is
in the natural and physical sciences,
7; while in only one line of work
has it seemed best to limit the num
ber of electives—mathematics. The
most radical change made in the re
quired work of the undergraduates
is an arrangement by which the
sophomore year will be the elective
to a considerably greater degree
than at present. Six three-hour
courses are offered each member of
the class, of which five must be
chosen, equivalent to fifteen hours
of classroom work.
The change also puts the study of
physics one year ahead in the course,
and allows cptioual work to the
sophomores, instead of only to the
juniors and seniors, a? formerly.
The increase of electives will also
extend to the junior year. I-. the
prospectus for next year the mem
bers will be allowed twelve instead
of nine hours' work in electives, only
one course of three hours constitut
ing their required work. The re
quired course is in mental and moial
science. In the senior year, as
usual, only one course of two hours
is required, and such latitude is
given that this is really an elective.
The course is a choice of seven elec
tives in moral science.
