We desire to give a plain account
of the trouble last Saturday in tela-j
tiou to the baseball game. We feel
that our readers should understand
the matter fully. Cooney, the non
resident professor of pitching, to
whom objection was made by our
manager, is a clerk in Smith & Gil
bert's store, San Francisco. It is :
positively known that he has done i
no work in the University of Cali
fornia this year. Whether or not he
receives emolument for his services;
with the Berkeley aggregation is an
open question, but he is certainly in
no sense a university student, and
the Berkeley people know such to be
the case.
Manager Grove some time b.fore
last Saturday's game understood that
an attempt was going to be made
to play Cooney in the inter
collegiate gams, and on March
30th wrote to Sutton, recorder uf
the university, asking for the stand
ing of the objectionable man. Mr.}
Sutton replied that Cooney was not j
a member in good standing of the
institution. Nothing further was
thought of the matter here, our man
ager tupi osing rerkeley would not
try to work him in, until the names!

of the Beikeley team were sent down
and Cocney's name appeared. A
let'er was then written to Manager
Wolfe stating the contents of Be
corder Sutton's reply.
Nothing further developed until
th« team reached San Francisco last
Saturday afternoon Coonev was
on hand. Manager Grove refused
to play unless he was withdrawn,
but finally, in order not to disap
point the crowd, allowed the game
to go on, first entering a written pro
test. The game resulted, as a'l
know, in a decided victory for our
team.
Manager Grove, re-echoing the
sentiments of our student body, will
not play any aggregation that in
dulges iu underhand athletics and
has written the manager of the
Berkeley team that unless Coonev's
name is dropped our University
will positively refu.se to play nest
Saturday. A reply is anxiously
awaited. It will solve the question
as to whether or not we are to have
pure athletics on the coast.
Technically Berkeley's manager
had a fair case last Saturday for the
articles of agreement drawn up
March 11th contain the following:
Article 111. Eligibility of players.
(a) No one not a member of the
university at the date of signing this
agreement, in good standing, shall
be allowed to take part in any game
played between the two universities.
(Ij) If the standing of any member
ot a team is questioned, such chal
lenge must be sent to the manager
of the baseba'l team to which the
challenged man belongs at least one
week before the date of the game
for which he challenged. The
decision of the registrar or recorder
of the university of which a chal
lenged man is a member shall be
fiual proof of his standing.
Manager Grove failed to comply
with the letter of this agreement
and did not send the written protest
required Bat the University of
California plainly violated the spirit
of the entire agreement, and has
shown herself in a most unenviable
light. In justice to the faculty of
that institution, it must lie said that
they are working hard to assist our
faculty and student body in purging
professionalism from our athletic
contests Let now ihe better ele
ment among the students of Beike
ley refuse to be dominated longer
by a band of tricksters who wiil use
any kind of underhand means to win
present victory, regardless of the
reputation it gains the university
and college athletic* generally. Let
us see some manliness exhibited. In
the long run trickery will always
defeat itself.
