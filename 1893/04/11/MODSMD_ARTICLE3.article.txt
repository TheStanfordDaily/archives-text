Pres Jewett of the U. C. Eoating
Association has written again, urg
ing an eight-oared race next fall and
another a year from this spring.
This matter ought to be immediately
pushed forward If we are to row
Berkeley at all next year we will
have to order our training boats
now. To do this we must be assuied
of at least $">OO from the students.
Two hundred new members of the
Boat Club will furnisa this. Give
your names to INIr. Seru-les.
