### 
The announcement is made by the
committee of the faculty in charge
of the matter, that Memorial Day
exercises similar to those of last
year will take place in the chapel,
May 13th; also that a Memorial Day
excursion is being planned. The
committee is in doubt whether to se
lect Monterey or Santa Ciuz as the
objective point and are anxious to
get the concensus of opinion from
the students on the subject. Dr.
Jordan or any member of the com
mittee will be glad to have individ
ual preferences expressed. The date
for the excursion is Monday, May
15th
