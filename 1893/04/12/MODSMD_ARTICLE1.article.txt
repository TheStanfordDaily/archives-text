						Greeks and Greece of To-Day.

Prof. Walter Miller delivered the,
lecture Jast liiijbt on "The Greeks:
and Greece of To-Day."
As the son of a great man fails of'
due appreciation from comparison,
so the present inhabitants of Hellas
are cast in shadow by the pre-emi
nence of their ancestors. The an
cieut Greeks are not dead; they sur
vive iu the Greeks of to-day. Greece,
to which the civilized world of to-day
is so greatly indebted, comprises not
more than 30.000 square miles never |
united until to-day. For four cen-[
tuiies the inhabitants were held in
servitude by the Turks, but from the
day of Homer his country has
â€¢always been the highest pride of the
Greeks.
Intermarriage i& rrre. As fine
physiques and faces aie to be found
to-day as ever appealed as models to
Phideas. Language, which makes |
the Germans, Germans, makes the i
Greeks, Greeks of old. Because the |
golden age of Greek literature is
passed is no reason why the language
should be dead, any more than that
English should be dead because
Shakespeare, Milton, and Spencer
have passed away. Thucydides and
Pericles might read the Greek news-j
pajeraof to day intelligently, and
Paul might take notes in the Uni-;
verdty of Athens, or enter into dis
cussion.
There are four distinct tongues in
Greek the language of books and
papers, that of the learned, the
medium of communication as found
in common schools, and the everyday :
plebian discourse. The tendency of;
the schools is to eradicate all foreign
I
words from the language. Greek is
to the Orient what French is to mod
ern Europe.
A nation's way of thinking is re
vealed by its fanciful creations.
Greece is permeated by religious
legend. Greek religion was simply
nature worship.
The climate of Greece is similar to
that of California with less variation
in temperature between day and
night. There is a like similarity
in fruit, tlowers and vegetables.
The Greeks of the old glory dayc 1
were none too moral. We must not
condemn them too harshly now.
Falsehood, cunning, aud treachery
were the or.ly weapons they could
wield against their oppressors. To
the ancient Greek nothing was so
sacred as hospitality, and so it is
with his descendants.
Grecian education is divided into
four divisions, the primary, the Hel
lenic or classical, the gymnasium,
and the college or university. There
are 3 ; 000 students in the University
