An attempt has been made to fa
cilitate the handling of mail in the
registrar's office. Mail must here
after be called for at the desk, and
students will not be allowed to help
themselves as formerly We suggest
that a little more care all round,
not only with letters hut with pa
pers, would be agreeable to those
who get their mail at this office.
