The appearance of several thg
ehap:d Stanford pins calls attention
to the fact that, as a university, we
are still without an official pin, but
ton, or other badge. It will be re
membered that last year several
energetic attempts were made to
have the student body adopt a Stan
ford button, but that each of these
attempts was in vain.
The advantages of a distinctive
college bulge are felt by any one
who has traveled aud has sien the
students of other colleges, each
marked with the individual insignia
of his alma mat> r. As more students
go away from here and settle in dif
ferent parts of the country, the lack
of a Stanford pin becomes apparent.
This lack has led fifty or more stu
dents to become independent and
by assent common among them*
selves to procure a pin whic:,
though not the official badge of this
university, brands them as Stanford
students.
The pin worn by these is in the
shape of a small pennant or flag
made of silver back and cardinal
enamel front. Across the cardinal
in silv< r letters is the word Stanford
It is inexpensive and m iy be worn
by young men or women
alike. It seems as if the student

The vaiious des ; gns proposed last
.year— a monogram of L S -J. U.,
a circular button with a tree, a
hor e's head, and ethers —all met
\\ith objections. It was said of all
of them that they were not distinc
tive college pins, hut might easily
be mistaken for other institutions or
organizations Of the monogram it
was said to be too common among
high schools, academies and young
ladies' seminaries to be appropriate
fora university. The monogram
pin of Berkeley was brought in evi
dence of the fact that at a distance
such a design could not he distin
guished from a high school pin. Of
the tree design it was said that a
careless observer would be apt to
mistake it for some branch of the
Order of Forester?, Woodmen of
the World, Order of Druids, or
some other order. And so the mat
ter ended. "Whether the objections
were valid or otherwise it mattered
not. The fact that there was oppo
sition prevented the adoption of any
pin.
It is believed that should the flag
pin be suggested to the student
body it would be adopted. It is
distinctively a college pin. Harvard,
Yale, Cornell, Princeton, U, of
Pennsylvania, Columbia, Amherst,
XJ. of Wisconsin, Brown, Bowdoin,
and about ten other colleges have
adopted the same design, differing
only in the color of the enamel and
the letteiing. Also, no high school
or fraternal organizations me such a
design as their emblem; so when a
flag-shaped pin is seen on a person
it marks him as a college man.
Practically colleges have a monopoly
of the design, and this recommends
it to our use. It is urged that be
fore the students begin leaving for
home we should adopt this or some
other design fora Stanford piu.
