# It Costs Too Much.

The San Francisco 1 lave made a
proposition to the inter-collegiate
field day management to publish a
four page illustrated article on track
athletics in its number appearing
April 2'2ud, provided the manage
ment guarantee $100 to cover the
expense of publishing. The man
agement would be obliged to take
1000 copies of the paper also. As
the paper in question appears on the
morning of the games it was self
evident that very little good as far
as advertising was concerned could
be derived from the venture. The
committee here wisely rejected the
proposition, although the Berkeley
men had acted favorably toward it.
