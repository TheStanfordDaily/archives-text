proposed at the meeting in the
chapel to-morrow at 1:30 p.m.:
Article IY. will be amended to
read, "Any person who is a student
of the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity shall become a member upon
signing the constitution and paying
an initiation fee of $2.50.
• Any person whether student or
not may become an honorary mem
ber, provided no objection is made,
upon the payment of an initiation
fee of $10."
The object of this amendment is
to do away with the "red tape" at
tendant upon joining the club, and
to make the club more an affair of
the students at large than one of an
exclusive few.
It will be definitely settled whether
*we shall take steps fora with
Berkeley next fall. The report of
the treasurer will be presented.
All members mako it a point to
attend. All who are at all interested
in college athletics, whether mem
bers of the club or not, are cordially

with Berkeley is properly a Univers
ity question, and the opinion of all
the students should be secured.
