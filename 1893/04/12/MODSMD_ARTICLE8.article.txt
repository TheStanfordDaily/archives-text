Miss Rudolph, although barely
twenty-two years of age, has gained
a reputation which makes her t.he
greatest character impersonator iu
this country. Her impersonations
of negro, German and Yankee char
acters are without equal for their
natural rendering, and her recital
of "The Blind Flower Girl of Pom
-1 peii" is one of the most beauti'ul
and touching pieces ever given on
the Ameiicau stage.
Mies Rudolph has been greeted
i with crowded houses at Santa Cruz,
i Fan Jose, Oakland and San Fran
cisco, and the press has been loud
lin her praise. She comes under the
; management of J. F. Bragg,
I the manager of Bill Nye, James
| Whitcomb Riley, George Ken-
I nan, Will Carleton and others.
Her performance will be given in the
1 chapel nest Monday night, assisted
by the Quartette, University Band,
and other talent.
