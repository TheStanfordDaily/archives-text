# The
						University Team Beats San Mateo by a Score of 24 to 1.
## 
### 
Yesterday afternoon Manager
<srove took his team of baseball play
ers to San Mateo and pitted them
agiinst the boys at Brewer's School
■with the most gratifying lesults.
Our nun showed a marked improve
ment in their work, and the way they
rapped out singles, doubles and
home runs and stole bases was
highly entertaining to the Stanford
supporters. l'itchei CLapman <112
the San Mateos remarked at the
close of an inning, "I can't throw a
ball anywhere near the home plate
without one of those Stinfords
smashing it out fora base hit."
Our men are rapidly acquiring a
' batting eye" which will do more
to win vie ories for them than any
thing else. They are learning not
only to hit hard but to hit safely.
Another game or two like that of
yesterday will put them in almost
perfect condition.
As both Campbell and McLaine
are disabled, Capron was taken
along to do the box work. He
pitched a good game considering
the fact that he is entirely out of
practice. He shot the ball ever the
plate with all his old-time speed and
it is plain that with a little hard
practice lie would scon be capible
of the brilliant work which he did as
Varsity pitchy last year.
Davey distinguished himself by
making a sensational one-handed
catch of a hot liner and then doub
ling up a man at second. It was a
very pretty play. Lewis has the re
markable record of eight stole.i
bases and Walton is not far behind
Walton, as usual, carried oft' the
honors at the bat, making five hits
out of five times at the bat. He is
certainly doing some phenomenal
stick work.
At one or two points in the game
the men showed that they are still
somewhat lacking in perfect team
work. This seems now to be their
chief weakness. When the ball
goes near two men each waits for
the other to take it and the result is
that the runner is safe. This defect
can only be remedied by constant
practice aLd by timely words cf
advice fro m the captain.
Though the San Mateos were out
classed they played a plucky game,
and in the fifth inning, by means of
errors of our infield and a bare hit,
managed to make a solitary run.
This contented them, as they said
that they could not hope for more.
All tley wanted was the satisfaction
of scoring against Stanford
Woods made some fir.e stops and
throws and Griffiths and Edwards

did some good infield work. Len
tlrum at first base played a star
game. He Las an exceedingly long
reach and saves many an error on
low throws. He is also a good Lit
ter and we predict that he will be
heard from on the diamond in the
future.
As is always the case when the
team goes to San Mateo, both teach
ers and students were very kind in
their attentions. Our men were fur
nished with substantial refreshments
after the game, and otherwise treated
in a way which will make their visit
a most pleasant remembrance. Fol
lowing is the score of the game:
