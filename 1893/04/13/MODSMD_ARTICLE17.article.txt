The April number of Industry,
a magazine devoted to science,
engineering and mechanic arts on
the Pacific coast, contains a very
pleading criticism on Prof. A. W.
Smith's hoolc, which is entitled
"The Constructive Materials of En
gineering" Mr. Richards, the editor
of the magazine, says (quoting the
latter part of his article): ' We once
had occasion to criticise the title of
Professor of 'Machine Design' be
stowed on Professor Smith when he
joined the faculty at Palo Alto, but
if the present treatise discloses his
methods, we recall all doubts as to
'design' being, in most respects at
least, raised to the claim of a science,
and an art to be professed. The
present work is an answer to that
criticism, and it is only fair to ad
mit, places the matter in a new
light."
The writer goes on and speaks of
the advantage of the book over
others. The article ends by saying:
"We have gone on thus far and con
sumed our space without particular
mention of the contents and have
only room to remark upon a schol
arly diction in the work that is sur
prising. There is a precise use of
technical terms, and of general ex
pression, indicating education in a
wider field than one country and one
language permits. We congratulate
Professor Smith, and rccommend
everyone engaged in constructive
work of metals to procure the book
and examine it."
