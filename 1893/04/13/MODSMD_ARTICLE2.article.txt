The entries were closed last even
ing for the doubles tenuis tourna
ment, which will take place next
Saturday. Entries weie rather
scarce, but a glance at the drawings
will show that f-onie exciting sets
may be expected. It is unfortunate
that Campbell and Bannister, last
year's winners, will not appear.
They claim a lack of practice, but it
is hoped they will make a good show
ing when they are needed to go
against Berkeley.
All competitions will be decided
by the best two sets out of three
except in the contests for first

and second places, when the best
three out of five sets will wiu.
Playing will begin promptly at
9:30 o'clock Saturday morning, in
order that the finals may be played
off early in the afternoon. The
young ladies have kindly given per
mission to hold the tournament on
the Roble courts, and the tennis
management has accepted the oft'er.
Two first class rackets will be
awarded the pair winning first place,
and half a dcz?n tennis balls to each
of those winning second place Com
petitors must furnish balls for the
sets in which they play.
