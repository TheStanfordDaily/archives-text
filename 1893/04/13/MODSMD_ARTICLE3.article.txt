### 
Contending with many difficulties
the committee on the Junior recep
tion have at last made arrangements
for Friday evening that promiso to
be very succ.ssful. The gym., the
scene of the coming event, has been
tastefully decorated and the floor
waxed. The feature of the evening
will be placed in the galleries for
those who do not wish to daLce. All
are requested to come promptly at
7:30, as tie lights will only run
until 11:45. At 12 o'clock the lights
will be turned on acrain for 15 min
utes in the halls. Brandt's orches
tra of San Francisco is to furnish
the music.
About eighty coup'es are expected,
besides the faculty and their wives,
who have been invited, and it is to
be hoped as many as possible will
attend. Mrs. Jordan, Mrs. Stillman,
Mrs. A. W. Smith, Mrs. Sampson,
Miss Thompson and Mrs. Fyft'e will
act as patronesses, and quite a num
ber cf guests from abroad will be
present. It is important that tickets
be procured beforehand, as none
will be told at the door. The last
chance to secure tickets will be at
1:30 to 2 o'clock in the registrar's
office. The reception committee is
composed of Messrs. L. V. W.
Brown, .J. A. Keating. W. B. Moul
ton, John Van Denburgh, and
Misses Shellev anel Maburv.
