Last week at a meeting of Iho
baseball nine the members of the
club decided to disband uniil next
year on account of the lateness and
also because two or three- of the be.-t
players are away sick, The nine
will be without a pitcher or catcher
next term as they both graduate at
the end of the year, unless some of
the new fellows who enter in August
will be able to till the vacancies.
Since the new gymnasium has
been finished the fellows have been
amusing themselves by using it as a
dancing hall. The apparatus will
not be put in until May, so that
it leaves a clean floor upon which to
dance.
Last Wednesday views were taken
of the buildings and grounds for the
purpose of being put on exhibition
at the World's Fair. To-day groups
of the various athletic teams will ba
taken for the reception day issue of
The Cricket.
