Special notice is called to the ten-1
nis tournament announcement which
appears on the first page. As will
be seen, only seven pairs have en
tered the tournament This is an
exceedingly poor showing. Thei
tennis players evidently do not re
alize that the great tournament with
Berkeley will be jilayed in a very
short time. After winning last year
with an inexperienced team aud all
the conditions unfavorable to us, a
defeat this year would be disgrace
ful. Another tournament will prob
ably be held before meeting Berke
ley, and it is the urgent, duty of every
player with even ordinary ability to
enter it with a resolve to win.
