# Oakland High School Notes.
## 
### 
The High School has just recov
ered from the surprise of winning
the A. A. A. A. football champion
ship with such ease, and is now set
tling down to a consideration of her
chances for the field day. A short
time ago they appeared altogether
hopeless. Persistent training, how
ever, has brought out some new
material in the 0. 11. S., and as the
ether schools seem to take but lit
tle interest in the event, Oakland
may carry off another trophy this
term.
A very welcome addition to ath
letics will come to the high school
in the shape of Chuk, the grammar
school high jumper, who won the
running high jump recently at the
Olympic track with 5 feet 7 inches,
a phenomenal performance consider
ing the age (15 years) of the ath
lete.
The high school pin now appears
all over the school and is a decided
improvement upon its predecessors,
although in point of taste and
beauty it leaves much to be desired.
Tie Aegis election for next term's
officers comes off nest Thursday,
and the outcome of the long struggle
for supremacy between the Theta
Chi and Gamma Eta Kappa is
looked forward to with considerable
interest. As matters now stand
neither party can control the elec
tion, and a compromise is confi
dently exptcied by the knowing
onesâ€”indeed, it is the only solution
of the problem.
The 0. 11. S Debating Society ia
in a flourishing condition. Its mem
bers keep up a very live interest in
its doings, especially at elections,
in which the Australian ballot sys
tem is used. Here, as everywhere,
the fraternity spirit of rivalry is be
ginning to be felt.
The question of a class-day to
precede the graduating exercises
will shortly be passed upon by the
graduating cla?! 2 .
