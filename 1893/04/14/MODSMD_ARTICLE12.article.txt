It is entirely feasible to run an
excursion train to San Francisco
next Saturday, Apiil 22d, the date
of the intercollegiate debate and
field day. Many students are quite
anxious to attend both events who
feel that they cannot afford to spend
two dollars railroad fare in addition
to necessary expenses while in tLe
city. To secure special rates of half
fare it is only necessary that the rail
road company dispose of 300 tickets,
and we feel that this can easily be
done. Fully fifty, whatever the fare
may be, will be compelled to make
the trip as participants in the debate
or field day. One hundred and fifty,
at least, in neighboring cities and
towns will take advantage of a low
rate, aud wf are then left wiih only
a hundred additional tickets to dis
pose of. This we believe can easily
be done; but what is done must be
arranged for quickly.
