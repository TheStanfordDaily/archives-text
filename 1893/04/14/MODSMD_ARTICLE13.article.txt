Not in a mean spirit at all, but
with a feeling of an injustice having
been done, we desire to call atten
tion lo the manner in which the
Junior Class was treated by the bus
iness management. No one can
douot !'or a moment that, even in
this staid community, half past ten
is entirely too early to Liing a formal
reception to a close. Feeling such
to be the case, permission was se
cured by the class to have the elec
tric lights run two hours beyond
the usual time, all expenses to be
borne by the members. Yesterday,
however, a terse note was received
from the business mannger, saying
that the privilege could not be al
lowed. Now it is quite apparent
that such a spirit is one that merely
dislikes to be accommodating, and
the Juniors are pushed to the alter
native of using lumps in a frame
bu.lding. A few favors now and
then go a long way, and a few un
kind thrusts likewise.
