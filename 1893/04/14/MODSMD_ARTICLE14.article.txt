kie Subscription lists are now
being circulated among the stu
dents and nil who expect to attend
the coucerts should subscribe now,
iu order to induce Mr. i kie to
come here Acer ftin number of
names must be assured. Tickets for
the series, as bas been stated, are
two dollars. Those who mbscribe
get reserved seats while those who
purchase tickets at the door must
take their chances.
In view of the fact alone that with
with tickets at one dollar each
these concerts have been drawing
crowded houses in San Francisco,
there should be a hearty response
here.
