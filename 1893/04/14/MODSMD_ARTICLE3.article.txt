# No Baseball Yesterday.
## 
### 
The Varsity baseball men went to
Santa Clara yesterday afternoon to
play a game with the Santa Clara
Cullege boj s, but when they arrived
there they found their coming was
unexpected and no arrangements
whatever bad been made for the
game. It was a great disappoint
ment, but there had been a misun
derstanding all around. Our men
made the best of it, however, aud
took an hour or two of hard pract'ce
on the college diamond. Just be
fore dinner time two niues were
rnsde up from our men and some of
the college boj3, and a shoit game
of three innings was played, but its
result is unimportant.
The Jesuit fathers extended their
usual hearty greeting to our men
and were profuse in their expressions
of regret that matters had turned
out so unfortunately. They probably
will allow the Santa Clara team to
come up hero and give us a game on
our home grounds in a week or two.
Our men are in good condition for
the game to he played to-morrow
with the University of California at
the Piedmont grounds in Oakland,
and hope to be able to place another
victory to their credit.
