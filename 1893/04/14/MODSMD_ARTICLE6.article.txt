# The 						New Running Track.
## 
### 
The measurements for the new
track are nearly completed and
Messrs. Rix and Mclntyre who have
charge of the work, will soon com
mence the actual construction of it.
A foundation of rock will first be
laid, and this will be covered over
with a thick layer of coarse cinders,
and when it packs dowu it will be
just of the right firmness and spring
iness for running. Around the
inner and outer sides will be laid a
plank curb, which is always required
on a track where records can be
claimed. The curves will be more
gradual than on the old track. The
centrifugal force which influences a
runner when rounding a curve, will
be much less marked and it will be
possible to make much faster time
This idea of changing the shape of
the track to help the runner is some
thing new in track construction and
may have much to do with lowering
records within the next few years.
Yi'hen our track is finished we can
safely say that it will be the best in
this state and one of the finest and
fastest in the whole country. If the
materials are brought promptly on
hand it will take only about a month
to complete it, but as this probably
will not be the case, we can scarcely
look for it to be ready for use much
before the first of June. It will be
drained perfectly and there will be
none of the old trouble from flood
ing during the heavy rains The
new mesaurements have shown that
the old track was seven or eight
yards over length. It is no wonder
then, that our runners have not
mado any better records.
The new track will do away with
the baseball ground in the oval.
Another diamond will be made in
the field just east of Enciua. The
inside of the oval will probably be
made into a lawn and planted with
shrubbery.
