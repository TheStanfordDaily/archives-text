# THE 						JUNIOR RECEPTION.
## Encina Gymnasium, April 14, the Place and Date of a Prominent Event in the University History. Seventy Couples Participate in a Round of Enjoyment—Brandt's Orchestra Assists-A Partial List of Those in Attendance. 
### 
The University his been stirred up
for some time iu anticipation of the
junior reception. It has at last couie
and gone, and the Class of '04 may
with justice congratulate itself on
providing such an enjoyable enter
tainment.
From the founding of the institu
tion until the present date the stud
ent body has longed lor some event
of this kiud and has wondered who
would make the first step. It was
eminently fitting that no exclusive
set of persons should inaugurate the
movement, and therefore everyone
felt pleased when it was announced
that the "Class of '04" would lead in
the onward(?) march.
Neat invitations appeared a couple
of weeks ago. Eucina gymnasium
was the place selected for the event,
and last Friday evening the time set.
A significant phrase appeared in the
lower left hand corner; it was,
"Dancing, 7:30." At that hour ve
hicles began to draw up before the
doors, and by eight o'clock fully
seventy couples had arrived.
The old gymnasium hardly knew
itself. Dexterous hands had been
working to take away the accustomed
bareness, and they had been success
ful. One entering saw first at the
far end of the building an immense
" 'OA" worked in poppies, above
which hung intertwined many yards
of the class colors —dregs of wine
and shrimp pink. Behind this
pretty screen Brandt's Orchestra of
Ban Francisco was concealed,
anJ during the entire even
ing furnished excellent music.
Arches of cedar adorned the three
corncrs, and the graceful bamboo
and ornamental palm filled up the
inte-vening space so as to leave with
one the consciousness of a most
pleasing effect. Nor was tLe boasted
cardinal made subservient to any
thing, for the gallery tastefully dec
orated with it enhanced the bril
liancy of the whole scene.
At 8 o'clock there was the open
ing march and the dance programs.
Those latter were neat affairs. They
were enclosed in stiff write covers,

which were emblazoned on the front
with the monogram L. S. J. U. in
raised gilt letters, and on the Lack
with '94 in raided letters. Tha in
side of the covers contained the
names of the patronesses of the
occasion, who were Mrs. David
Starr Jordan, Mrs. John M. Still
man, Mrs. Albert W. Smith, Mrs.
Martin W. Sampson, Mrs. Clara V.
Fvffe, and Miss Ellen F. Thompson;
and of the reception committee, con
sisiing of L. V. W. Brown, Miss
E. 11. Shelley, Miss E. Mabury,
W. B. Moulton, J. Van Denburgh,
and J. A. Keating. Cardinal couls
and tassels held the programs in
place. One learned from them that
he was at liberty to make engage
ments for sixteen dances and four
extras
The main floor was used for danc
ing and the galleries for cards and
kindred amusements. At half past
ten light refreshments were served.
The scena throughout the even
irg was a most attractive one. The
brilliancy of it all, the many pretty
costumes, the moving couples, will be
remembered even aiter other events
of the kind are given, for this re
ception was the first in the long list
that will follow. Many straugers
