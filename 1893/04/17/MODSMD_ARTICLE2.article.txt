# ANOTHER VICTORY.
## Berkeley Again Defeated. Score 10 to 6. 
### 
The second, intercollegiate base
ball game in the series of three be
tween Stanford and the University
of California was played Saturday
afternoon at the Piedmont grounds
in Oakland, and victory once mere
perched on our banner, our op
ponents being defeated by a score
of 10 to G. This gives us the iuter
co'ilegiate championship for this year
beyond a doubt. The third game,
which will be played a week from
next Saturday, probably in San .Jose
in order to give the students a bet
ter chance to witness it, will have
nothing to do with he fiual result.
There were probably between five
and six hundred spectators in the
stands when Umpire Mannasnu
called the game at 2:30. Dr. Jor
dan, Prof. Angell and one or two
other members of the faculty took
pains to be there and cheer on our
men by their presence. The wear
ers of the blue and gold far out
numbered the supporters of the
cardinal, but the latter tv.ade up in
euthusiasm what they lacked in
numbers. By their yells and cries
and running lire of comment
they encouraged our players and
spurred them on to greater efforts
for the honor of their <t!ma mater.
'l'he game was very exciting and
closely contested throughout. Up
to the sixth inning Berkeley main
tained the lead and our prospects for
success seemed very poor, but in
that inning our men took one of
their batting streaks and piled up
four runs, placing them three tallies
ahead, and from that on to the end
of the game they were not overtaken.
Pitcher Campbell ha<l been ill all
last week and was in poor condition
for playing, but he pluckily went
into the box and pitched the game
out. In the first inning when he
gave a base on balls and hit two
men it seemed as if he were going to
lose the game for us right there, but
after two runs had been made and
the bases were full he steadied down

and retired the side by ttiiking out
the heavy hitter Johnson. He was
batted quite heavily throughout the
game, though he managed to keep
the hits scattered in tuch a way that
they did not net many iuns. He
was most effective when the bases
were full. Several times the Berke
ley side was retired with two or
three men on the bass. This is
fchown by the fact that fourteen
Berkeley men were left on base dur
ing the game.
Matthews for Berkeley was quite
wild, anJ luckily for us showed a de
cided penchant for allowing hits
when they counted for runs. In the
eighth inning he was taken out of
the box and Pierce put in to pitch
the remainder of the game. Pierce
did moderately good work, allowing
no hits during the two innings
which he pitched.
The two teams were about evenly
matched as regards their batting
ability, but our men excelled by far
in fie'.ding and base stealing, as the
score will show. Lewis, Walton, and
Sheehan did nearly all our heavy
batiing, and Harmes, Galimlo, aid
Johnson hit hardest for Berkeley.
Morse made some fine catches in
left tield but spoiled his record bv a
rank muff. All our outfielders
played their positions in scientific
style and gathered in every thing that
came within reach. Walton put up
his usual reliable game behind the
bat, but was a little inaccurate in his
throwing. Following is the score:
