Miss AusderOhe has written to
Prof. Goebel from Santa Barbara,
saving that she will be in San Fran
cisco this week and would be glad
to cotoe to Palo Alto and give a con
cert at reduced rates to the students.
It seems that she was not aware that
her manager asked a guarantee of
$500 when an attempt was made
some weeks ago to have her play in
the chapel.
The enthusiasm with which the
former announcement of a probable
concert here by Miss Aus der Obe
was received by all the lovers ot
music in <ur midst, is a guarantee
that now when so favorable an
opportunity is presented it will be
taken advantage of. Immediate
steps must be taken, however, if we
are to secuie this world famous
pianist.
