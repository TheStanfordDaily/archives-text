# Sunday Services.

### 
The services were led by Mrs.
Henrietta ot Francisco,
whose text was taken from the sixth
chapter of Galatians.
God has not placed us in this
world to live alone. If we love
Christ we love our fel'ow beings and
desire to help them up. There is so
much of selfishness and nobility in
human kind, must seek out the
nobility. It cos s but little to bear
one another's burdens. Every sac
rifice gladdens the heart, an there
are sacrifices for all.
Too many people are ornamental.
They are afraiJ to speak the truth
and do right. As a nation we bear
one another's burdens as citizens.
He must be strong who would help
the weak.
Life is short. If we could but re
member the long eternity we would
not leave things undone, nor let tlip
our opportunities. We are laboring
to leave something behind us. We
should have no other aim in life
than to work out our destinies.
Carelessness makes a shipwreck of
existence.
