# Examinations at Cornell.
## 
### 
A movement baa been started at
Cornell for the purpose of raising
tbe standard of college ethics in re
spect to examinations. A statement
for signature has been circulated
among the students asking for each
individual's assistance to suppress
cheating and to raise the standard of
honor throughout the student body.
From the number of signers tbe
plan sefinis to meet with tbe appro
bation of the majority of tbe stud
ents. Tbe statement as drawn up
reads:
"\Ye, tbe uodersigned, believe that
concerted student action can do
much towards raising tbe standard
of honor here in regard to univer
sity work, and further believe that
such elevation of the moral tone
would be greatly for tbe best inter
ests of tbe university.
We, therefore, wish to form an
organization for the purpose of such
improvement, and pledge ourselves
to further its object by every effort
entirely consistent with henor.
