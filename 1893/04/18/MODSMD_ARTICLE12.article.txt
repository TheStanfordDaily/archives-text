The suggestion made in the stu
dent body meeting this afteruoon in
regard to tbe action of the students
at inter-collegiate contests was
timely rendered. So long as the
remarks give vent to one's university
enthusiasm no fault can be found,
but when personal remarks and slurs
ate directed at individual contest
ants, the tone of the University is
jeopardized and it is time to call a
halt. All the relations with our
sister institution should be charac
terized by a high grade of courtesy
distinctive of college men only.
