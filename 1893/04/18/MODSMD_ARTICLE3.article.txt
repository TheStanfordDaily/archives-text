### 
Miss Carrie Rudolph, the great
character impersonator, gave an en
tertainment at the chapel last even
ing, assisted by the Glee Quartette
aud University Band, that more than
fuluiled the expectations of the
audience which greeted her. Her
rich, cultivated voice, in her recital
of "The Blind Flower Girl of Pom
peii," was displayed at its best, and
caused repeated applause. Her
versatility of performance was won
derful. Her rendition of "Mrs.
O'Toole in a Street Car" and "Pa
meely"were exceptionally well done.
The Glee Quartette was at its best
and gave two numbers. The Uni
versity Band also played two pieces,
which were highly appreciated by
the audience. Shirley Baker, with
piauo accompaniment by Austin
Ivautz, sang "Mountebanks" and a
selection frotn the Robin Hood
opera, both receiving a prolonged
applause.
Although the house was only two
thirds full, Miss Rudolph can con
gratulate herself upon one of the
most successful entertainments ever
given here., and if she should appear
here again at some future date she
would undoubtedly be greeted by a
crowded house. She has a charming
voice, face, aud figure, and we pre
dict for her great success.
