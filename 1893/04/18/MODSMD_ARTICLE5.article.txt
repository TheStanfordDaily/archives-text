# Andrew D. White.
## 
### 
In all probability ex-President
White will not be with us next year
as President Cleveland shows no
inclination to appoint a successor to
him as United States minister to
llussia. In fact it is well known
that Prof. White could have received
an appointment under Mr. Cleve
land's first administration, fo it is
not probable that he will be re
moved from office under th j present
administration.
In the loss of l'r cf.White Stan
ford loses, fora time, a splendid
man, but in him the United States
has gained an able representative in
her diplomatic corps.
