Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Iu looking over the list of entries
for our inter-collegiite tield day, I
see a number of places where we
could better the arrangement. Take
the pole vault, for instance. We
have only one man entered. Sup
pose for any cause he should be
unable to participate. It is foolish
to expect one man to take three
prizes. If we have a man here who
can reach nine feet, I say put him in.
In the mile run we have several
candidates who can more than com
pete with some of the men chosen.
A student who lias been training
hard for this event and who cculd
do credit to our University, was not
allowed to enter. For the hammer
throw and shot put we have several
men who can do better than some of
those selected to compete with
Berkeley. When a man can put the
shot over 34 feet G inches he should
have a position on the team.
Is it encouraging, after training
hard for some event, to be excluded
from the team on which are your
inferiors? Why did not Stanford
put on more men? If we are to
limit the number, why not put on
the best we have? " "
