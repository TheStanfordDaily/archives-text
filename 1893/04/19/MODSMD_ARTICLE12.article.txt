It takes a large amount of vim
and energy to put into the life of
any university that progressive spirit
that will place an institution of
learning in a prominent position be
fore the public generally and the
college world in particular. The
Class of '9-1 has always shown itself
thoroughly awake to meet exiting
needs in our university life here. Its
determination to get out an annual
—and one, at that, which will do
credit to us—is highly commendable.
The meeting to-day to arrange fora
board of editors, etc. was character
ized by na enthusiasm that speaks
well fora readable and comprehen
sive production.
