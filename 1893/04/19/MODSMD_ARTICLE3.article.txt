l'rof. Anderson delivered the lec
ture in the chapel lust evening on
''James Russell Lowell as a Political
Poet and Thinker."
Mr. Lowell was born on Washing
ton's birthday in 1810. He was cf
one of the best New England fami
lies, and was brought up in Cam
bridge while it was yet a village.
There he was brought in contact
with plain Yankees. Me went to
Harvard, but here his career was
not distinguished, as is the case with
man}' great literary men. The rea
son these literary men did not dis
tinguish themselves in college was
because they devoted themselves to
what they liked and not to what the
university required. At Concord he
met Emerson. liis first appearance
in the literary world was as a literary
trifler. He married a Miss White
who transformed him into a great
poet, i. e , brought out his poetic
genius and made him a moralist.
She brought him iu contact with
transcendentalism. Attention was
first drawn to him by the appear
ance of the Bigelow Papers in 1840,
the characters of which were taken
from life. Lowell shows how liter
ature keeps language alive, and not
language literature. No language
can kill true genius.
Lowell thought, the Mexican war
but an extension of slavery. At the
outbreak of the civil war the second
scries of the Bigelow Papers ap
peared. His soul was stirred by the
sentiment of the war period. Hosea
Bigelow is Lowell uncultured. At
the close of the civil war came his
great outburst of patriotism in h'B
Commemoration poem. No modern
poem of patriotism surpasses in elo
quence and passion this poem.
Lowell bad the activity of several
different men. He wrote most
tender graceful lyrics. He is the
most versatile of American writers.
He appeals to the senses and to the
intellectual side of nature. Haw
thorne was more impassionate but
narrower than Lowell. Emerson
was deeper. More favorable con
ditions could not be found for the
development of a man of letters than
surrounded Mr. Lowell. He was
born in affluence, surrounded by
wit and high culture and stimulated
by love. He resembles Goethe
more than any other writer.
In 1867, after his career in -Eng
land, he gathered all his political
writings together. During his min
istry in Spain and England he wrote
many memorable things. He was
in great demand for public ad
dresses. His essay on books and
libraries compares favorably with

Emerson's essay on books. His
style mellowed by tune, became
more compact and he learned the
full use of his mother tongue. (lis
later essays were vivid and vital.
Lowell's wit justifies the best degree
of the words ''educated with wis
dom
His character makes a beacon
light for any young man. In 1834
at Bermington he delivered his great
address on Democracy, displaying
great breadth of thought, in which
he gives the healthiest definition of
patriotism.
