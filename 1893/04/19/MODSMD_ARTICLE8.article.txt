The structure is located bet'veen
Shumla and Helmet stations on the
Southern Pacific By. in Texas. It
is 2,180 ft. long and 328 ft. above
the surface of the stream, and comes
next to being the highest bridge in
the world —the Loa Viaduct on tho
Antofagasta By. in Bolivia is 330 ft.

the great Kinzua Viaduct on the
New York, Lake lvie, anil Western
Bail way.
The gift of blue prints is a valu
able one, and will be much appreci
ated by the students in engineering.
The structure and the scenery are
well worth visiting, and students
passing over the Southern Pacific
lines to and from the east will do
well to stop off and see it.
