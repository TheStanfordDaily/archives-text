# Prof. Swain Will Leave Us.
## 
### 
It was announced by the press a
few days ago that Prof. Swain had
been offered the presidency oi' the
Indiana State University. It can
now be definitely stated that he has
accepted the offer and will take up
the duties of his new office nÂ°xt fall.
He will remain here the rest of this
semester and conduct his classes as
usual. Immediately after our com
mencement he will leave for Indiana
to look over the field of his new
work. The second week in June he
will appear at a meeting of the State
University Trustee?, and on com
mencement day, which occurs the
latter part of June, he will deliver
the address to the graduating class.
He will succeed Dr. J. M. Coulter,
who has been elected to ti e presi
dency of the Lake Forest University.
Prof. Swain will probably continue
the policy of university management
that Dr. Jordan inaugurated there
when he became president nine
years ago, and which Dr. Coulter
has followed out during his two
years of office.
It is likely that Prof. Swain will
not be called upon to fill the chair of
mathematics in connection with his
other duties. His work will prob
ably bo mainly executive and he will
only deliver courses of lectures from
time to time as he sees fit, in the
same manner as Dr. Jordan does
here.
His relations with both professors
and students at Stanford University
hare been most pleasant during the
two years that he has spent here,
and it is only with the greatest re
gret that he leaves them; but he feels
that for many reasons it is best for
him to go. Indiina is his native
state, and he was connected with its
university as student and professor for
twelve years. He will be situated
only a few miles from his old home
where his aged parents live, which
will be very pleasant for him.
