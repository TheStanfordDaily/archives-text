The management Las decided to
play the third intercollegiate base
ball game in San Jose. As this was
decided on nearly a week ago it
seems high lime for some steps to
be taken in the matter of advertising.
The poor attendance at the two
games already played was caused by
lack of printer's ink and nothing
else. In some places the posters
were placed upon the boards only
the night before the game was
played. This manner of procedure
is not business-like, to s.iy the least.

TLe prevailing sentiment seems to
be Hat baseball is dead. Baseball
has not bad a show at this Univers
ity. By judicious advertising make
people know tbat there is to be a
game; run a special train to San Jose
on the 20th inst , and it is highly
probable that a goodly turn will be
turned into the athletic treasury as :i
result of it.
