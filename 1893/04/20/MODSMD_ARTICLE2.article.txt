# Intercollegiate Debate.
## 
### 
Unfortunately the debaters of the
intercollegiate contest have been
able to secure but two judges. This
is not owing to any disagreement
between the representatives of the
two universities. The three judges
were agreed upon and two—Jackson
Hatch of San Jose, and Judge Mor
row of San Francisco—accepted the
invitation. Dr. Stebbins, the third
judge decided on, not seen un
til Tuesday of this week, and then
asked to be cxeused.
Another judge will no doubt be
secured by to morrow, as a number
of good men are under considera
tion
