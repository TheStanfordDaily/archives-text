Last Friday's issue stated that the
baseball team had gone to play with
Santa Clara without any previous
arrangements, and that consequently
there was no game. This is en
tirely a nrstake. The game had
been duly arranged with the cap
tain and manager of the Santa Clara
team several days before the game
was to take place.
It seems that on account of some
trouble the authorities of the college
disbanded the Santa Clara team the
day before the game and forbade
them to play. This fact was not
reported to me, so I toolc the team
to Santa Clara according to arrange
