Eliter Daily Palo Alto:
It uugurs ill for the success of our
athletic team in the coming held
day with Berkeley when we cannot
show enough college spirit and en
thusiasm to attend this field day
en masse.
The special train project will
probably be given up. Those selling
admission tickets say that they can
find very few purchasers. Now it
seems that we ought to show a'

stronger support for our team than
saying "I don't care to go." Such
an answer has been made to many a
query about the purchase of a ticket.
If we hope to give our team en
thusiasm at all, the best way to do
it is to attend in large numbers and
shout our appreciation of their ef
forts. It is probably true that we
expect to be defeated, but we have
what is termed "a fighting chauce."
Berkeley will turn out in large
numbers for this event, and it is only
justice to ourselves that, ha\iug a
larger attendance at the University,
we ought to have a larger represen
tation. S &S
