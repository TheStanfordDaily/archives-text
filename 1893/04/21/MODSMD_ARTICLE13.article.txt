What has become of the dramatic
club in these later da t ys? Are they
preparing for commencement week
in accordance with the elaborate
plans formulated a while back? The
majority of the students will remain
here during commencement this
year, aud an excellent opportunity
will be given the dramatic club to
make their evening one of the suc
cessful events of the year. We hope
to hear of activity in this direction
before long.
