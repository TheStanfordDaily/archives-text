If we are to have a game with
Berkeley on April 29th, why are not
arrangements completed and the
game advertised? As long as the ad
vertising is left until the last mo
ment, so long can we expect to see
the money of the athletic treasury
depleted. We have been informed
that if a game is properly advertised
in San dose the contest would draw
a large crowd and more than pay ex
penses, thus widely differing fjom
the one in Francisco and the
other in Oakland.
