In another place is a letter re
ceived from A. A. Stagg represent
ing tie committee who have cha*ge
of the basebdl tournament which
will be held at the World's Fair this
summer. Coming from as reliable a
source as it does and olleiing in
duccn ents in tie way of expenses,

the Board of A'.liletic Directors
should lake iaimediate action a'terj
carefully considering the matter.
Unlike the letter sent some time
ago from the Chicago Navy, which
was indefinite and offered no trans
poitation, I his last one contains
more specific conditions and guar
antees a good share of the expenses.
The f.ict that many of the promi
nent eastern teams, among them
Yale, have already agreed to enter;
the contest should satisfy us that
the invitation is worth investigating.
Indeed we cannot afford to let
such an opportunity slip byâ€”one
probably that w.ll not be had again
for years. It will be an excellent
chance to test western enthusiasm
and enterprise against long estab
lished eastern skill and training.
