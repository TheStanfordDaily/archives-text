The objections made by Mr.
Clemans in the last meeting of the
student body to certain forms of
coaching and to guying the opposite
side in iLiter collegiate contests seem
to me very well taken. In the ball
game at Oakland Saturday last the
incessant yelling detracted greatly
from the pleasure of the game for
many if not most of the spectators.
Whatever yelling to unnerve the
opposite side may he, it is certainly
not baseball, and a game gained by
such means is no more won on its
merits than if won by reflecting sun
light in the eyes of our opponents at
critical intervals.
One often hears the complaint
now-a-days that people are ceasing
to take interest in baseball and that
the game is dying out. As regards
professional baseball this, to a cer
tain extent, is true, and there is
danger that the same fate may Lefall
college baseball unless a sharp line
is drawn between college and pro
fessional ways of conducting a game.
Among the most objectionable
features of baseball, even to the
hardened habitues of professional,
has been the rancorous din of profes
sional coaching designed to rattle
the opposing nine. It is hardly
necessary to say that the better
class of spectators attracted to the
college games find an objectionable
professional method still more ob
jectionable in college students.
