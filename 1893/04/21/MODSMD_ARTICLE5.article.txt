In looking over the names of the
students who were nominated for
editors on the '95 annual the names
of but two engineering students
appear. Now this is, no doubt, an
oversight, and surely a mistake.
There are many engineering stu
dents in the University who possess
just the faculties necessary for some
phases of the wo:k ou a class annual.

"We cannot question the ability ol
our engineers. They are thought
ful and progressiveâ€”yes, represen
tative of the University as much as
any class. That many of them
possess literary ability in no mean
degree none can deny. That in
their midst are men who possess the
peculiar attributes above mentioned
is equally indisputable.
Surely then, in the face of these
facts, the engineers cannot be totally
ignored in this election. Let them
decide on some yood men and pre
sent their names for election next
Wednesday. We can afford to
make no mistakes in this important
matter; the best talent only will be
equal to the occasion.
Hi.-top.y Major.
