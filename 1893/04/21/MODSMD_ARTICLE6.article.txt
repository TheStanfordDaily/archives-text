Captain Stanford Univeisity 13ase
ball Nine,
Dear Sir: The committee in charge
of the World's Fair Baseball Tourn
ament have authorized me to in\ite
your nine to compete under the fol
lowing conditions: That only bona
fide students pursuing a regular
course in the University and under
no remuneration for their services
play on the team; that a sum suffi
cient to pay for one-ha!f the r.eccs
sary expenses of transportation be
given, the remainder being paid ac
cording to tho surplus after all nec
essary tournament expenses have
been paid; that per day be al
lowed twelve men during time your
nine is in the tournament. Two de
feats will probably disqualify a nine.
The tournament will be a great
success. Already ten nines have ac
cepted the invitation. There is also
little doubt, 1 think, but that the
surplus will be sufficient to pay full
transportation. Let me hear from
you soon. Also give date of summer
closing. Strictly a college affair.
