### 
I>r. M. W. Hamma's stereopticon
lecture ou "Norway, the Wonder
land of the North," delivered last
night at the chapel, was of interest
not only for its literary finish, elo
quence of style, and art of word
painting, but also for its stereopti
con pictures, which were singularly
clear and accurate and charmingly
choice and beautiful.
Next Thursday ni<2lit ' Sweden
and Denmark to the North Cape"
will be exhibited by Dr. llatnmaand
that event, in power to captivate aud
richly instruct, is said to be rich in a
high degree, and bids fair to draw a
crowded attendance.
