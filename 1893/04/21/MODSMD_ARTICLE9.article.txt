### 
The horticultural grounds directly
west of Roble are beginning to rep
resent one of the most interesting
departments in the University. Five
acres noxt to the road leading to the
stock farm are cultivated with every
imaginable plant. There are about
one thousand varieties of fruits and
flowers and one hundred varieties of
seeds. At the northern end of the
ground are planted 450 varieties of
roses, thirty-two varieties cf figs, and
thirty-five of walnuts.
Of the typical plants there are
eighteen varieties of bamboo, fifty of
olives, a full collection of Persian,
Italian, American, and European
grapes; of the last there are 120 var
ieties.
Of the textile plants there are
New Zealand flax, ramie, esparta
grass, and jute. A great many ad
ditions are to be made to these.
There are two blocks now being
planted in peach, apricot, cherry,
plum, apple, and pear seeds. All
the shrubs are to b) classified, and
the work is to be carried on in com
mercial style.
Next year the grounds will be ex
tended to the north corner of the
museum nnd to Lagunita. The road
running back of Kobie will be re
moved, and in its stead there will be
one running from the rear cf the
woodshops to the gate which now
enters the stock farm.
