# A
						DEFEAT IN ATHLETICS.
## In the Intercollegiate Field Day U.C. Wins 91 Points, Stanford 35. The
						Result a Foregone Conclusion. Lack of Training Facilities May Account in Part for the Defeat. 
### 
Last Saturday afternoon our first
intercollegiate field day with the
University of California was held
at the Olympic Club grounds
iu San Francisco, and just as
we lad anticipated, our athletes
received an overwhelming de
feat. We succeeded in getting
only thirty live points to our oppo
nents ninety-one. In most of the
events we were able to do but little.
This serves to show that without a
training table ova good track for
practice it is impossible for our men
to into any sort of condition.
Considering the very unfavorable
•circumstances against which they
hrve had to contend, we have
nothing to feel ashamed of. Regard
ing the results next year, with lhe
proper training facilities, which we
hope to have, we shall make a much
better showing.
The attendance at the field day
was very gcod but the weather was
cold and raw and had a depressing
effect upon the the thinly clad con
testants. Probably for this reason
no better time was made. Because
of the large number of events, only a
passing uoticj can be given of a few
•of them.
Bernhard, '96, surprised everyone
by v.inning the 100 yards dash, de
feating the crack Berkeley sprinters,
Mays and Solomon, and our own
man Woodward. His time was
10 3 5 seconds, which was very
good, considering the strong head
wind. This is his maiden race, and
it is remarkable that he did s<> well.
Jle has a bright future before him in
track athletics.
We were greatly disappointed in
the showing made by Brown, as we
had rather hoped that he would win
the mile race and perhaps the half
mile. But his lack of training told
against him, and he was unable to
keep up with the speed of the Berke
ley men, I'heby and Powell.
11. U. Titnm won the mile walk
with lots to spare, Blake of Berkeley
comiug iu second. W. D. Timm
crossed tue liue third, but he was
ruled out for unfair walking and
Bancroft was given third place. Iu

the hurdles we stood no show at all,;
uot even having a man iu the finals.
Mays, U. 0., won the 220 yard dash
after a close contest with Woodward.
Some claimed that Mays fouled
Woodward on the turn but the
judges did not allow the foul.
In the bicvcle race we had a walk
over, and also in the 110 yards dash,
which Maynard won in the very
creditable time of seconds.
The five field events were all taken
by Berkeley, our men succeeding in
winning only four points. Hunt,
U. C , carried oft" the honors iu the
shot put aud hammer throw. He is
a very strong man and it will be hard
to beat him. Crane secured second
placi iu the pole vault, but did not
succeed in breaking his record of
0 ft. 11 iu.
It may be stated that first place in
any event counted five points, pcc
ond place three, and third place one.

three places only in the bicycle race,
