# VICTORY IN THE DEBATE
## The 						Debaters from Stanford Secure the Decision of the Judges. Short Synopses of the Arguments Presented by Both Sides. 
### 
In Odd Ftllow's Hall, San Fran
cisco, last Saturday occurred
the first intercollegiate debate be
tween tbe University of California
and Stanford. A large and appre
ciative audience of friends and stu
dents were present to cheer on their
respective favorites.
The question chosen for discus
sion was, "Resolved that the United
States should annex Hawaii," upon
which Beikeley had the affirmative
and Stanford the negative. Judge
\V. \V. Morrow acted as presiding
officer. The judges were W. W.
Morrow, Samuel Ivuight of San
Francisco, and Jackson Hatch of
San Jose. Each of the debaters was
allowed twenty minutes in which to
present his argument. The debat
ers for the University of California
were C. A Reynolds, '95, Hastings
Law School, C. 11. Smith, '95, and
L. M. Solomons, '93. Those from
Stanford were 11. L Gruwell. '93,
A. H. Barnhisel, '93, and Ward
Bannister, '93
C. A. Reynolds of the class of '94,
U. C., opened the question. The
spirit of conquest, he maintained, is
repugnant to a liberty loviug people;
it is as offensive as land-grabbing,
but when a weak nation asks for pro
tection and guardianship the appeal
should be seriously considered. He
indicated in a charming picture ot
the future that the coming genera
tions on the islands would receive
untold benefits from annexation, and
dipped into statistics to show that
the future citizens of the islands
must be Caucasians. The late
actions of the queen sealed the fate
of her dynasty and heralded the new
era. We should annex, first, be
cause the islanders demand it; sec
ond, to guard our commercial and
strategic interests. We must not be
driven from the seas by conservatism.
11. L. Gruwell, '93, the first
of the Stanford speakers, said: "My
opponent has spent a good deal of
time trying to show that no other
government should annex Hawaii,
lie has said little, or rather nothing,
about why the Government should
annex. Has the United States a right
to annex the islands?" he asked.
Then he went on to argue that the

so-called revolution 011 the part of
the natives was nothing but a con
spiracy on the part of people inter
ested commercially in the islands.
Proclamations, excerpts from the
papers and letters were read to hack
him."lf the consent of this people has
not been obtained, how can our
Government consistently annex their
territory? Judge Coolev says a pro
visional government has no right to
give away the land it is formed to
protect. What then shall sve say
about the Provisional Government?"
C. 11, Smith, '95, U. C., first made
a vigorous assault on the charge of
conspiracy advanced by Gruwell,
aud pointed out how utterly prepos
terous it was. He held that Gruwell
only listened to the rabble among
them and not to the intelligent
classes. His position was that the
only solution of the problem was
the open and unhesitating accept
ance of the proffered islands.
A. H. Barnhisel, '93, declared that
the other side had advanced only
two arguments for annexation.
First, because there are lots of
Americans there who have property
interests, and second, because of
their strategic position. ' Tell me,"
he said, "why should we protect
those Amerieaus any more than the
ones in Japan. Now why do we
want Hawaii fora naval, a strategic
station? AVe are not a naval power.
They say we waut a fort there to
protect our coasts. llow absurd to
hold that our commerce or England's
commerce, or that of any othei na
tion depeuds on their possession.
The policy of our government is to
avoid strife and now, at our most
prosperous era, they want us to pre
pare to grab foreign territory like
European nations. They're afraid
that if we don't grab the islands
that somebody ebe will. Non
sense."
Then the speaker took up the
theory of the Monroe doctrine and
showed that the idea of annexation
did not in any way coincide with it.
lie argued that 110 foreign nation
dare trespass in search, of territory
in the vicinity of the United States.
L. M. Solomons, t\ C., first took
up the question of keeping the
islauds after we got them. This line
of argument was all to show that it
wouldn't cost us so very much to de
fend them. "With Pearl harbor,"
so lie put it, "we would be impreg
nable on the Pacific." In war, he
claimed, Hawaii would be the first
point captured by the invading foe.
Then it would cost us extravagant
sums to oust them. Self-preserva
tion demands their acceptance now.
Ward Bannister, Stanford, '93, at
tacked the structure* set up by the
opposition, tbe need of a naval sta
tion on tbe islands, the inability of
the natives to govern themselves,
and the necessity of holding those
stations to subserve our [commercial
interests. He showed that it was
against the policy of the United
States to annex territory not contig
uous. He pointed to our policy in
the Atlantic of non-annexation, and
showed that our course in regard to
the Pacific should be the comple
ment to that of the Atlantic.
Mr. Reynolds, in closiug for the
University of California, declared
that the acceptance would be the
making of the character of the na
tives, "whom the other side seemed
to be so fearful of." Touching on
the policy of not annexing non-con
tiguous territory, he cited the annex
ation of Alaska and California In
summing up he said: "The United
States should not allow another na
tian to get the islands; they are im
portant from strategic points; the
other side have admitted that the na
tives are in a condition to be good
citizens. What common sense is
there in allowing another nation to
get control of them?"
While the judges were making
ready their decis'on tl e lerkeley
Glee Club enteitained the audience
with music. In a short time the
judges returned, giving a unanimous
verdict for the negative.
