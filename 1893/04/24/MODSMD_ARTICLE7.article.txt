# Sunday Services.
## 
### 
Rev. Anderson of Fresyo led the
services in the chapel Sunday morn
ing. Ilia subject was "Life and Im
mortality," and his text, "And hath
brought life and immortality to liyht
through the gospel."
The simplest, surest, safest, sub
limest view of man is the one found
in tho Bible. We are told that
there are no chasms in Nature, tlmt
there is a chain complete from a
grain of sand to an archangel. Jesus
Christ has a placa in that chain.
Jesus Christ came into the world
naturally, historically, and perma
nently. He is the ground and
reason of morals. He is the only
perfect manifestation of life physi
cally, intellectually, and spiritually.
He is a perfect representation of im
mortality.
We retain our identy after death
through memory, affections, and
character. The story in the new tes
tament of Lazarus and the rich man
is one proof of this. It proves that
we shall remain in the next world
what we have made ourtelves in this.
