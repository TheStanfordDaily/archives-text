Tiie intercollegiate debate was
such a success in every way that it
will need little urging to have such
contests regularly in the future. It
might bo offered as a suggestion
that insomuch that debates are be
coming quite popular in university
circles, that Berkeley and Stanford
tollow the load of the Haivard and
Yale Unions and Princeton Literary
Society and make the debates of
rather frequent occurrence during
the course of the year, say one every
two or three months. Such contests
are of the greatest practical impor
tance for the reason that they bring
before the student body living na
tional importance, and put our
young men and young women in
line fora satisfactory solution of the
] loblems of th* future.
