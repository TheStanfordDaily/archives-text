# Excursion to the World's Fair.
## 
### 
AYe understand that a large party
is being formed to go into Chicago
by way of tlie Canadian Pacific.
This is a good idea. The special
car which went east l;i&t June did
much toward advertising the Uni
versity. Let ail those students who
aie going to the Fair band together
and go into Chicago with a special
train if possible. Think of Stanford
sending a special train to Chicago,
and the additional right it would
give us to the claim for enterprise
we have heretofore shown!
We understand t;:e sentiment now
is largely in favor of going east by
way of Canada. If it is so let thosa
who have other preferences yield
(htm and aid in making up a large
delegation so as to all go in together.
The Canadian Pacific excursion, we
are told, starts ti e 26th of May. The
party goes by boat as far as Port
land. The whole upper deck of a
steamer will be chartered, provided
enough go; which would surely make
that part as delightful as possible.
The rates on the Canadian are very

reasonable and we see no reason
why this party should not go through.
A meeting is goiug to be held in
Roble Hall on Wednesday at 4
o'clock at which all those persons
who expect to go east are requested
to attend. Mr. Carson of the Cana
dian Pacific will be present and
answer all questions in regard to
rates, etc.
