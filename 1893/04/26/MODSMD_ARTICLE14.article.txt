Provided three hundred tickets
are sold at the rate of sixty cents
for the round trip, a special train
will leave the quad. Saturday morn
ing for San Jose, returning !n time
for supper if desired. This under
taking should receive the hearty
support of every student and not b
allowed to fall through on account
of a lack of interest as was shown
last Saturday. Last year the re
quisite number was secured without
difficulty and surely with our in
crease in numbers this excursion
should be a success.
