No action Las been taken yet in
regard to the annual University field
day which is to be held at the end
of May, provided the new track i3
coihpltted by that time. Frequent
iield daj*s in which handicaps are
allowed the poorer athletes is the
secret of Betkeley's buccess ou the
cinder track, and she has now a
team which is a credit to the ius'i
tutiou. r llu handicapping system
inspires beginners with the thought
of victory at tho first attempt, and
in this way is an incentive to num
bers.
The field day would uot only be
advantageous in bringing out new
men, but it if. highly important tint
the men be given a chance to better
tlie records now Baud ng, some of

which it would be a disgrace to
allow to stand as our best efforts for
another 3 ear.
