# The 						Special Train to San Jose
## 
### 
Manager Grove went to San Fran
â€¢ !
cisco yesterday to find out what
could be done in the way of seem
ing a special train to the baseball.
2faine in San Jo9e mxt Saturday.'

The railroad officials informed him
that we could have a special train at
that time and that they would fix the
fare for the round trip at sixty cents,
provided throe hundred students
desire to gj. If that many passen
gers could not be found, the fare
would be placed at 05 cents for two
hundred. The train would leave
the campus at 9 or 10 o'clock in the
morning and return in the evening
when we desired.
The matter is being canvassed to
secure the names of al! those who
wish to go but thus far has met with
rather poor success. Surely there
are three hundred who can afford to
pay sixty cents for the trip. Let all
who possibly can hand in their
names to Manager Grove orYv'alton.
We want a rousiug crowd to cheer
our team on to victory nex* Satur
dav.
