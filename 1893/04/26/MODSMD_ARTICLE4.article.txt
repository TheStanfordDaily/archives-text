# Tennis Tournament.
## 
### 
All preparations have been com
pleted for the singles tennis tourna
ment which is to be held next
Saturday, and a glance at the entries
will show that those who do not go
to the ball game in Pan Jose may
expect to see some good tennis.
The men are more evenly matched
this year than they were last, and to
pick the winner would be a difficult
task Several new players are show
ing such good form that they will
stand well for first place.
