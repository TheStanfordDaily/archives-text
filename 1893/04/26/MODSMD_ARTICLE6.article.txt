# An Old French Romance.
## 
### 
Prof. Todd entertained a large au
dience last evening in the cliapel
with personal reminiscences con
nected with his studies at Rome.
Many old manuscripts are pre
served in the Vatican library, to
which Prof. Todd had access. One
of them exhibited quite a different
nature and subject from the others.
Prof. Todd set to work to decipher
this old poem. It dates from the
) ear 12)0, and he found a peculiar
interest in tracing the words along
the line of the old monk who had
written it. The study consists iti
eliminating the mistakes of the
scribe. To do this one must be well
acquainted with the language in
which the manuscript is written.
After a three months' daily attend
ance at the library of the Vatican,
Prof. Todd completed the copy,
which he supposed to be the first
ever made. At Paris, however, he
found that a copv had been made
pome thirty-five years lefore.
Prof. Todd gave in biief the con
tents of the poem, illustrating the
life of the twelfth and thirteenth cen
turies Its subject was,"The Ro
mance of the Rose," which title
came from the birthmark on the hero
ine. The poc-m is one of chivalry
of many characters; a fastidious ro
mance to be recited in court circles.
There are forty different songs in
troduced in the poem, which were
probably sung in the recital of it.
There are many manuscripts bearing
the title of "The Romance of the
Rose." This is probably a coinci
dence in this case, for the story is
entirely different.
In deciphering this manuscript
one has the errors of but one scribe.
It is much harder than in the case of
many copies of the same story, for
no two scribes are liable to make the
same error. The author dwells to
some length on the beauty of the
heroine, and the exultation of the
tournament. The whole poem is
singularly free from coarseness
and narrowness.
