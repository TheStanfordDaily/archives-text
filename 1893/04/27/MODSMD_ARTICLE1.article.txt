# THE
						JUNIOR ANNUAL.
## Another Election and Another Tie on the Ninth Name. 
### 
The Class otj '95 met this after
noon in accordance with the presi
dent's call fora new election, there
having'been some ballot stuffing at
the electijn yesterday.
Warning [was given that if any
more illegal voting was attempted,
causing so much delay and inconve
nience to the class, a diligent effort
would be made to apprehend the
guilty persons by means of the ident
ification of the duplicate pignatures
on yesterday's ballots, which were
carefully kept in case it should be
come necessary to prove that illegal
voting had been done.
Those who got a place on the nine
yesterday were: Field, Cham
berlain, Rice, Lewis, Sheehan, Fry,
Mies Caldwell, and Misses Ilerrick
and Stadtmuller a tie. To-day Field
and Chamberlain received 50 votes
each; Baker, 40; Rice, 38; Fry, 36;
Lewis, 32; Miss Herrick, 31; E
Magee, 28, and Sheehan and Miss
Stadtmuller each 2G, a tie fora place.
This stands as the legal result of the
election for the nine editors of next
year's annual. No provision has
been made yet nor has any decision
been arrived at in regard to the tie
vote. With the exception of this tie
the board of editors is definitely de
cided upon, and the election of an
editor-in-chief and two assistant
editors from their own number is
their first business before they begin
their editorial work
It seems as though the Class of
'95 with its some two hundred and
fifty members should have little
difficulty in turning out an annual
of which the University may be
proud and which would be a model
to succeeding classes.
