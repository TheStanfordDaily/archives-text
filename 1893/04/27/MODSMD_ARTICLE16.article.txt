The inter class and faculty-class
baseball games of last year were a
means of t-o much interest and en
joyment that their renewal this year
is justified. It is rumored that the
graduate students and faculty \vi 1
be the firot to attempt to win honor
and applause on the diamond.
The name to lie given to the jun
ior annual is of importance, because
a name decided on now will he the
one that will cling to the publication
for the years to come. Latin and
Greek mines are justly becoming ob
solete for all university papers and
the like. The name should not be
too common, although, if pO:sible, a
significant one should be secured
The "Tech./' for instance, is quite
taking. In the absence of such,
however, would not a Spanish word
be appropriate? The whole matt: r
should be carefully canvassed before
a name is decided upon.
