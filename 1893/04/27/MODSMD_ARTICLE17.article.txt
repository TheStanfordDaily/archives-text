The challenge fora debate coming
from the University of the Pacific is
published in this issue. It would
be all light, we think, under oidi
nary circumstances, to accept the
challenge, but it should not be
thought of this late in the semester.
Hardly a man of ability has the time
to take from his examinations at
present, and of the three who de
battd with Berkeley all are seniors
and will be rushed fiom now on
until the last day. The enterprise
and energy of the University of
Pacific is appreciated and the senti
ment seenn to be that we v\ould
like to contest with such a progr< s
sive student body, were it possible.
