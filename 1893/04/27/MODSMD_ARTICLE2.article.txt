# No Special Train Saturday.
## 
### 
The University was thoroughly
canvassed yesterday and it was
found that it will be impossible to
get the required three hundred stu
dents to go to San Jose, so a special
train will not be secured.
Paulsen will run his buses from
here to San Jose for the accommo
dation of the students, leaving the
campus about 9 or 10 o'clock in the
morning and returning after the
game. He will charge one dollar for
the round trip.
