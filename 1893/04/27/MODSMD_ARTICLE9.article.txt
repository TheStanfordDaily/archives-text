The challenge to a debate issued
by the University of the Pacific on
Monday is worded as follows:
University of the Pacific,
April 25, 1893.
To the Officers and Members of
the Leland Stanford Jr. Universityâ€”
We, the collegiate students of the
University of the Pacific, watched
with iuterest the result of the recent
Stan ford-University of California de
bate with the purpose of inviting
the victorious university to engage
with us in a similar contest.
It is well known to all former and
present students of the University of
the Pacitic that the representatives
of the University of California have
always been unwilling to meet us on
the rostrum; and for that reason we
were pleased to learn of your success
of the night of the 22d iust.
We therefore invite you to engage
with us in a like contest, to take
place withiu thirty days from the
date of this communication.
It ii useless to say that an early
reply is nccessary, as the time for
making the needful arrangements
and for giving the participants time
for preparation is brief.
H. E. Milnes,
Cor. See. Student Body.
