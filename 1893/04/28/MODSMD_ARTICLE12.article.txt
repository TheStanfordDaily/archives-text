A member of the Boat Club com
plains unjustly of the manage
ment of tlie Boat Club by the board
of directors. The board of directors
have doue all in their power to sup
port the club. There is not money
enough in the treasury to buy a. Yale
lock and 100 keys as was proposed
some time ago It has taken every
cent that could be raised to make the
payments on the boat house. $250
has been paid and there is still 8200
due.
The board of directors have used
all means m their power to raise
money. The faculty were called on
and seven out of sixty odd members
generously responded. Now we can
never have a Varsity crew unl-ss
every one in the University takes an
active interest and a substantial one,
too Good wishes won't buy boats
The students here have also been
very unenthusiastic. The Berkeley
Boat Club has over two hundred
members; this means another $">OO.
Now there is no reason why Stanford
should stand still and see Berkeley
snil ahead of us in this matter. If'
we are to row next year we must or
der an eight-oared barge this year.
There ought to be at least two or
three hundred students in a univers
ity of this size who have enough col
lege spirit to help support a crew.
Every student in the University
ought to make it a point to join the
club even if he never expects to go
near the water.
