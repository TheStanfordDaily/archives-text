### 
In a recent, interview fit Washing
ton Stnator Stun ford was asked by
a reporter if he had beard of the
agitation in the stato over the re
rnoval of the capital. He answered:
"Yes, and not without gome feeling
of iegret. Not tint 1 think the
people will ever commit so serious n
mistake as to freely and voluntarily
assess themselves for the payment of

milliuna which such an edict would
necessitate it, but 1 regtet that so
much energy (should be wasted by
our pet'ple thus, when if applied in
like proportion to legitimate neces
sities would benefit the sta'e iu its
entirety. Should the soldiers get to
quarreling, and were permitted to
do iO, while in the line of march, it
would not be long before they found
themselves left in the rear. So it is
in the great match of progress now
extending all over the country.
California cannot afford to waste
her energies iu local turmoil, and if
she does, like the obstreperous sol
diers she will find herself fur in the
rear."
