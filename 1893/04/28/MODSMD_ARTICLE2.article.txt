# The 						Land of the Midnight Sun.

### 
Mr. M. W. Uammadeli vered a
most interesting lecture on '-Norway,
Sweden and Deuinark" in the chapel
last evening. The lecture was most
profusely illustrated with most
beautiful views of the extensive har
bors, the large market places, the
cathedrals, and the mountains and
plains of these countries.
Mr.Hamma spoke to some length
of Thorwalsen, the great Danish
sculptor. Illustrations were given
of mauy of his works, chief among
which were "Night" and "Morning."
The scene 3 of his museum and tomb
were particularly interesting.
Among the best of the views were
those of the far north of H.ammer
fest and North Cape. Mr. Hamma
described most vividly the utter
loneliness and desolation of the
"Land of the Midnight Sun." He
certainly succeeded in taking his
audience with him to "the end of
the earth," to the great waste of
waters, where only sounds the cry
of birds and the plash of the sea,
while over all forever shiues that
never-setting sun.
