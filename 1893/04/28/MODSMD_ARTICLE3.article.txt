# Religious Indifference at Stanford Denied.
## 
### 
In the Congregationalist of April
20tli Prof. F. C. Clark has ati article
on "Religious Life at the Leland
Stanford Junior University." The
idea has somehow gone abroad that
there is little or no religious spiiit
in the University, and that, in gen
eral, little religious work is being
done. The aim of Prof. Clark's ar
ticle is to disprove this.
Immediately after the opening of
the University in 1891 a Y. M. C. A.
and aY. W. C. A. were organized
and under their auspices a canvass
of the University was made, showing
that about fifty per stud
ents were church members. A simi
lar canvass at the beginning of the
present year revealed about the same
per cent, of church members.
Prof. Clark also calls attention to
the effective work of the Y. M. C. A.,
not only in the University but in the
neighboring town?, showing that
there is great religious activity in
the University. Such articles as the
one in hand are partiularly valuable
at this stage of the University's ex
istence, for they will tend to "nip in
the bud" erroneous ideas that would
do the University much harm.
