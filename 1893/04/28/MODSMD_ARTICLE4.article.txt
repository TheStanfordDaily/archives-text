## The
						Varsity Shows Up in Fine Form and Wins by a Score of 26 to 1. 
### 
The baseball team went to San
Mateo yesterday to play their last
practice game before meeting Berke
ley to-morrow. The game was well
played and was much more lively
than those formerly played with the
same team. The San Mateos scored
one run in the first inning which
sufficed them through the game,
while our boys made twenty-six
runs. Barring the fumble of Ray
on third base, the Varsity put up an
errorless game and ran the bases
with dash. The hitting was some
what erratic, Calhoun and
each securing a three-bagger.
McLaine and Walton put up a
pretlv battery game aiul are in good
condition for to-morrow's game.
Campbell played a star second base
for the San Mateos and hit well.
Capron changed catcher and right
field. Wood, the San Mateo
pitcher, w..s much more effective
than formerly and held the boys
dcwu well with the support he re
ceived.
After the usual genial hospitality
of Mr. Brewer, the boys left for the
University at 7 o'clock.
The team will leave for San Jose
to-morrow morning at 8:30 in a four
horse bus. The make up of the
team is as follows: Walton, catcher;
McLaine, pitcher; Downing, first
base; Davoy, second Lewis,
shortstop; Hay, third base; Harrel
son, left field; Sheehau, ceuter field;
