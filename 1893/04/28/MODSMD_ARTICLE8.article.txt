# Baseball Expenses,
## 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
It is probably not known to the
majority of students that baseball
has cost nearly $200 more than Las
been received from it. A large por
tion of this expense Las been neces
sary, and the cause of light receipts
is well known. But in view of the
fact that the receipts have been light,
it would seem that some economy
should have been practiced. For
instance, it would seem that the
numerous trips to St. Matthew's
Hall, Santa Clara College, and other
places which cost the students eight
to ten dollars per trip, might have
been done with withoutâ€”especially
when the team was known to be able
to defeat its only rival. It is re
ported that on a week from to-mor
row a game has been arranged be
tween Stanford and the Deaf and
Dumb Asylum; to take place at San
Jose. It might be well for the Ath
letic Board to ascertain what chance
there is for the game to pay ex
penses before it is authorized. At
games similar to that and the San
Mateo games, last year the players
were glad to pay their own expenses
for the privelige of playing.
