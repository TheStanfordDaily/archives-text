# THREE STRAIGHT GAMES
## The 						Final Baseball Game in the Intercollegiate Series With U.C. Won with Ease. Score 12 to 4. 
### 
The last intercollegiate baseball
game of tbe year between Stanford
and tlie University of California was
played Saturday afternoon at Recre
ation Park, San Jose. The men
from Berkeley did not stand a ghost
of a show of winning at any stage
of the proceedings. For the first
four innings not a man of them
leached first, and it was only in the
last inning that tbey succeeded in
getting a tally.
McLaine seemed to weaken
slightly in the ninth inning, as he
allowed Simpson, the first man up,
to make a hit and followed it up
with a base on balls to Galindo.
Kay then fumbled a grounder from
Harmes' bar, and the bases were
full. It was a critical situation, but
it looked fora moment as if our op
ponents were to be shut out after
all. Morse knocked a grounder to
Davey, who fielded cleanly and by
quick work got the ball back to
Walton in time to catch Simpson at
the plate. This made one man out,
with the bases still full. Goslinsky,
next at bat, lifted a high fly which
Sheehan gathered in Af.er it was
caught Galindo btarted bome from
third. Sheehan threw the ball in
promptly and Galindo would un
doubtedly have been shut out if
'McLaine bad let the ball go on to
tbe plate without interference, in
stead of cafebing it in front ot the
pitcher's box and then passing it on
to Walton. A second cr so of val
uable time was lost in this operation
and Galindo succeeded in scoring,
thus blasting all our hopes of a
ehut-out.
I'arkhurst bunted along tbe first
base line and Walton, after running
down the ball, threw it over the first
baseman's head clear out into right
field, Harmes scoring on the error.
Calhoun then made a long throw
back to the plate, but Walton, in
stead of being there to receive the
ball, as he should have beeu, seemed
temporally to have forgotten all
about the game and was standing oft'
to one side engaged in conversation
with a Berkeley player. As a result
the ball kept on till it struck the
backstop, and Morse brought in the
third tally. Matthews followed with
a hit, scoring I'arkburst. Daily j
etruck out, and the trouble was over. I

The Berkeley men were very weak
j at the bat and the leas said about
their fielding the better. They
! dropped pop flies and juggled easy
I grounders in an astonishing fashion.
1 Simpson did their best work, both
| with the bat and in the field,
i Goslinsky played a good game at
first, and Browning and Ilarmes
managed to get through without any
errors.
It will be noticed that every man
on the Berkeley team, except Gos
-1 linsky and Daily, played in at least
two different positions during the
game.
It is needless to go into details as
i to how our runs were made. There
was just one long procession of base
hits and errors and bases on balls,
with some judicious base stealing
sandwiched in now and then for
variety. Walton led at the bat as
usual, with Calhoun and Davey a
| close second.
The fielding of our meu was per
fect up to the ninth inning, when
they eased up and made their two
| errors. The outfielders gathered in
everything that cime in'.o their terri
! Tory without a break. Lewis and
Davev both did star work in their
positions and Downing played well
at first, making a difficult pick-up of
Ray's low throw.
McLaine pitched a good, steady
game all the way through and al
lowed only four hits off his delivery.
Walton gave him good support but
was very wild in his throwing once
or twice. Davey and "Walton ex
ecuted a pretty play in the sixth in
ning. While Parkhurstwas at third,
Heller staited to steal second. "Wal
ton threw the ball down to Davey
who re'.uined it to the plate in time
to catch Parkhurst who tried to
score. It was very neatly done and
called forth well merited applause.
An enthusiastic delegation accom
panied the team from here in Paul
sen's big bus and quits a number of
students went down by train. Pro
fessors Swain, Angell and Woodruff
and Dr Wood witnessed the game.
The team had rooms at the Hotel
Yendome, whe-e they took lunch
and dinner, returning to the Uni
versity by bus in the evening.
