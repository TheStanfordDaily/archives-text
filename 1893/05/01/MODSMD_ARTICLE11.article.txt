The regular meeting of Euphionia
was held on Satuaday evening.
An impromptu speech by Mr.

program. Mr. McGeorge had an
interesting paper on "Recollections
of My Early Life." The subject for
debate was "llesolved that the press
is a teacher of immorality." Messrs.
Cathcart and Field spoke on the- af
firmative and Messrs. Pierson and
Bullock on the negative The sub
ject being a popular one the general
discussion was unusually interesting
and entertaining.
