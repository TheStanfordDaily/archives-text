### 
The Sunday morning service was
lead by the Rev. T. Filburn of San
Francisco, bis text being taken from
the first chapter of Paul. The
Apostle Paul, looking cut on the
world from Tarsus, then a center of
culture and learning, saw in the
city of Rome a field for work and
conditions for success. He made a
discriminating outlook. He sees
the pagau glory at its highest point.
He sees the difficulty of placing his
new institutions against these ad
verse conditions. All these doubts
cause him to hesitate, but it is only
fora moment; his faith rises and he
is ready to go out and preach the
gospel of Christ. The v,orld at this
lime was one of slaves. They were
found in every household. Christi
anity is dynamite to slavery and baa
ever had the spirit to raise up and
free itself from the shackles. But
the confidence which Paul had in
his gospel and institution gave him
power to go against all.
The world in the time of Paul was
immoral and degraded. The vices
of our day to those of Christ's are
as twilight to midnight.
Women were degraded —were but
the toys of the men of Rome
The standard of society is judged
by woman's place in it. We only
recognize the great power which
Paul foresaw when we see woman of
to-day raised to the great height
for which the great Creator intended
her. Paul realized the difficulties
which beset bis way; he knew that
the gospel would be mated with
contempt. It had nothing in it to
commend it to the people to whom
he was to carry it. It had been re
jected by the people for whom it was
intended. The Greeks had not ac
cepted it, and at this time the Ro
mans were borrowing much from the
Greeks. This gave Paul another rea
son for doubt, but Christianity is no
beggar among nations; it has won
for itself the rank of respect and rev
erence. Befoie it was accepted in
Home there was net a single house
of mercy.
Does Christianity do what it pro
poses and what it was appointed foi?
Yes, it does what it assumes to do
and accomplishes what it proposes
What it does for the individual it
can do for the mass. Christianity
keeps its promises to mankind. This
is revealed in the testament of the
dj ing. But a step and man reaches
glory.
