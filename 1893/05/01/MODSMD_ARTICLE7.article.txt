It is highly important ihat ar
rangements should be under way if
Ave expect to hold a field day this
year. Because the track will not be
finished until the last of the semes
ter is no reason why our athletes
should quit training. The facilities
are just as good as before we met

material comes out and the old
brought up to higher standard what
can we count on but defeat next
year? Pray, let us have a field day
and con inue training.
