# Entrance Requirements.

### 
A very comprehensive statement of
what subjects may be offered for ad
mission to the University and of
otber matters pertaining to prepara
tory work will appear in a week.
The whole matter is embraced in a
large seventeen-page circular and
contains much additional informa
tion in regard to entrance subjects
which is not included in the new
register. It will prove a very timely
and valuable aid to preparatory
schools and to pupils contemplating
taking the entrance examinations or
who hope to receive credit without
examinations. The circulars will be
distributed from the regis'rar's office
free of charge, just as are the reg
isters. Persons wishing either the
register or the circular, or both,
should seud a postal to The Regis
trar, Palo Alto, Ca'.
The following is quoted from the
proofs:
"For meeting the entrance re
quirements of the University, candi
dates are offered a choice of twenty
fcix subjects, of which ten are neces
sary for admission to regular stand
ing, and flight for admission to par
tial standing. These subjects are all
reduced to the unit of a high school
year, and placed on an exact equal
ity, except subject 1 (English) is re
quired of all applicants."
The list of subjects that a candi
date may select from i = : 1. English;
2 3. Elementary Algebra; 4 Plane
Geometry; 5. Solid Geometry and
Trigonometry; G. Advanced Alge
bra; 7. Physics; 8. Chemistry; 9.
Physiology; 10. Bjtany; 11. Zool
ogy; 12. Freehand Drawing; 13.
American History; 14. English His
tory; 15. Grecian and Roman IJis
tory; IG. English Literature; 17.
Spanish; 18-19. French; 20-21 Ger
man; 22-23. Latin; 24 Latin;
25-2G Greek. The subjects double
numbered count as two subjects
each.
In regard to tLe requirement in
all cases of subject 1 the circular
says:"It is plain that every student
should be taught to use the English
language correctly. It is equally
plain that many so called educated
men are unable to write clearly and
readily. . . The difficulty is not
solved if English composition is
taught in the college only." This is
the reason that English 1 is made
an entrance requirement. No stu
dent can be admitted to regular
standing who has not passed in this
subject.
Additional regulations are an
nounced in the case of subject 8
Chemistry. Proficiency in this aub-i
ject admits the student to second!

year's work in Chemistry in the Uni
versity. Grammar school Physi
ology is not sufficient for entrance
in that subject. A practical know
ledge of ltotany is required. Free
hand drawing meaus pictorial draw
ing with unaided hand and eye.
Subject 1 (English) is divided into
two parts. In la, certificates from ac
credited schools will be accepted;
iu 2b, for the present no certificates
will be accepted. Every candidate
for admission to regular standing
will be examined in lb, aud no can
didate will be marked "passed" who
is unable to use the English lan
guage correctly aud efficiently in the
tests to which he is subjected.
