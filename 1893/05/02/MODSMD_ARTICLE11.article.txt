Out bulletin boards might be of
still greater benefit to the student
body if a little care and watchful
ness were used. Those posting or
writing notices should see always
that the dale appears; something
about "to-day" is often misleading
Those in charge, also, of the boards
at Encina and the quadrangle should
certainly remove all papers and
written notices as soon as they have
survived their day of usefulness.
