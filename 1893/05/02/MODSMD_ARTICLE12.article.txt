Once this year we invited Kerke
ley to row this spring, but they de
clined. Now they are making elab
orate preparations to meet us next
fall. As to whether we shall row
them next fall we can answer with a
straight forward no. Everyone
knows that next fall will beabsoroed
in football and that it would be fool
ish to have two such important
events conflict. Next spring is the
fitting time for puch a race and the
one for which Stanford will hold
out.
