# The 						Zoological Club.

The bi-weekly meeting ot the Zo
ological Club was held as usual on
Monday evening at the home of Dr.
Gdbert on Salvatierra street. The
club has greatly increased in num
bers, as there were fifteen present at
this meeting. This is partially due
to the kindness of Dr. Gilbert in
having the mee'.iugs held at bis
house.
Mr. Thoburn gave an interesting
account of an expedition that he re
cently made to the San Lorenzo
river north of Santa Cruz for the
purpose of collecting the lamprey
eel and studjiug its habits. The
lamprey is a salt water fish and as
cends the streams at this season to
spawn. All the specimens found
this year were dead and floating in
the stream. They were covered
with wounds but the cause of their
death could not be definitely ascer
tained. A great majority of lam
preys die after spawning, but these
had not yet laid their eggs.
Mr Pierson told of a large crow
roost that he had noticed in southern
Nebraska. The crows in immense
numbers frequented at nightfall an
islaud in the Missouri river. During
the day they would scatter over a ra
dius of twenty miles, feeding among
the fields, and in the evening return
to the roosting-place on the islaud.
Mr. Price had also noticed a similar
roosting-place and flight of crows in
the San Joaquin valley. This latter
roost is on the San Joaquin river a
few miles southwest of Lathrop.
Mr. Van Denburgh had something
of interest to say about a young red
tailed hawk which he was raising.
He had taken it from a nest when it
was about two weeks old; but the
little bird wo- growing rapidly and
was a voracious eater of fresh beef.
Some of the older members of the
club had local notes of interest, and
bofore the meeting adjourned it was
moved that the members tell of their

plaus for the summer vacation. Dr. j
Gilbert, Mr. Thoburn, Mr. Van
Denburgh and some others expect to
take a horseback trip from Monterey
to the Mt. Whitney region of the
southern Sierras, cross over into the
Owen's liver valley, follow north
up that river to Mono lake, and re-1
cross the Sierra Nevadas by way of
Yosemite v-lley. Mr. Snyder ex- '
pects to go north into Oregon and (
Washington, aud will devote much
of his time in studying the mammals
aud reptiles of the regions visited.
Messrs. Price and Wilbur will prob
ably go into southern Arizona and j
northern Mexico, where they will :
stud}' especially the birds and mam
mals of the region. The work will j
chiefly be done iu the mountains,
and attention will be paid to the;
distribution of animals. Messrs.'
Lunt and Stowell will visit San |
Pedro Martin mountain in Lower
California, southeast of San Diego,
and there make a collection of speci
mens of different kinds. Many
others of the club will devote some
time to study in the field, but they
did not know just where they should .
be.' It was hoped one more meeting'
could ba held before term closed, j
