# The 						Origin of the Sense Organs.
## 
### 
Dr. Jenkins delivered a very inter
esting lecture in the chapel last
evening 011 "The Origin of the Sense
Organs." The subject being so
wide, it is difficult to give a popular
lecture, tor it is always apt to be too
scientific, though in these biological
lessons we lind many points of inter
est. Dr. Jenkins first explained the
structure of the eye and ear by
meuus of charts. Lie then trac.d
the retina, which is a very compli
cated organization, from its most
elementary form to the perfect sta'e.
We know fairly definitely the origin
of the senses. They come from the
cells forming the epidermis, brain,
spinal cord, nads and hair. They
are not only alike actually, but are
actually the same. They all pass
through a program more or less
alike to their full development. By
observation of the eggs of various
vertebrates we can see the retina
forming out of the skin, and so with
all the sen-;e organs. They all begin
in simplicity and unity and end in
complexity. He showed by means
of diagrams and charts the gradual
development of the eye from that of
the limpet to the more complicated
forms of animal life.
