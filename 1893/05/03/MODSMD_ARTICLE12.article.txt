We have clipped to-day in
rather a wholesale style from a re
cent issue of the Occident, the U. C.'s
Belf gratulatory weekly. In con
trasting the way in which Berkeley
students and Stanford students take
victory or defeat, it is only necesmry
to compare the publications issued at
each university immediately after
some intercollegiate contest.
In the nine separate contests be
tween the U. C. and Stanford it has
been the U. C.'s good fortune to
win two, one a baseball game lust
year by means of a semi-professional
nine wearing U. C. uniforms and
ably assisted by an unprincipled
umpire; the other, the recent
field day. It was not enough
for Berkeley that, by reason of our
lack of training facilities and the
"newness" of our athlele3, the pre
conceded victory in the field day
should be hers this year. She must
proclaim her injuries at the hands
of Stanford men.
Speaking of fouls, what was done
to "Woodward by Mays in the 220
yards dash? The judges would not
allow the too evident foul, so we
made no fuss about it. Powell him
self apologized to Brown after the
race for fouling him, and Pheby of
the U. C also acknowledged that
Powell fouled Brown in the mile
run.
It is not our policy to enter into
petty contioversies with contempor
ary college papers, but v.hen p.r
sonalities are dealt with in eucli a
manner as in the Occident some
defense must be made. With re
gard to Brown's joking remark to
his old schoolfellow I'owell, as he
playfully Hp; (d him with a towel

in the dressing rooms after the race,
the Berkeley version is exaggerated
and pei verted. Brown's words
were, "liven if you did beat me I
was hound you wouldn't make good
time."
