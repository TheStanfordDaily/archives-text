# Lecture on Eyes.
## 
### 
Yesterday Dr. Eaton of Portland,
Oregon, lectured to the class in hy
giene on the diseases of the eye.
His remarks were both interesting
and instructive. He begun by say
ing that physicians have not now so
much confidence in lemedies as for
merly. They pay more attention to
preventatives acd give more import
ance to the hygiene of the body.
Often strong common sense is
needed to keep a person from be
coming hypochondriacal regarding
liis eyes and thinking that he has
lost the ability to use them.
The first trouble to bo considered
is redness of the eyelids. It is
caused by the radiated heat from the
ground, stoves, etc., and is most
often leen in light complexioned
people. The remedy is to use black
smoked glass to prevent the heat
from striking the eyes. It also often
results from rubbing the eyes with
the hands. The hands are never
■surgically clean, and when placed in
contact with the eyes leave deposits
of microbes which may cause dis
ease. This redness of the eyes may
come also from inflammation of the
nasal passages or the straining of the
eyes from the neglect to use glasses
when they are needed. The power
of focusing the eyes decreases with
age.
Styes are small abcesses in the

eyelid. They are caused by germs,
which bring on inflammation. If
pus from a boil i-? rubbed on the
skin other boils will spring up
wherever the pus gains entrance to
a hair follicle.
In no case should a burn of the
eyelid be allowed to heal without
the care of a physician, as the con
traction caused by healing may
cause a terrible deformity. Eyelids
have been known to turn wrong side
out because of inadequate treatment
after being burned.
Spasms of the eyelid, or excessive
winking, is caused by refltx action,
and sometimes, especially in chil
dren, is mere nervous irritation.
Ordinary smoked glasses found in
the market are usually defective and
injurious to the eyes. What are
called "Coquille" glasses should be
especially guarded against. They
are made by pressure, not by grind
ing, and produce astigmatism. J
Gas is not so good for lighting «s
lamps or electricity, as it contains a
large amount of sulphur, which, as
soon as it meets the water in the air,
forms sulphuric acid, thus leading
to inflammation of the Dry
air irritates many eyes. It may be
remedied by evaporating water in
the room
A foreign body in the eye may
lead to serious results. It is very
easy to learn how to remove it by
everting the eyelid. (Here the doc
tor made a practical illustration on
one of the students.)
All discharges from the eyes are
infectious. Towels used by persons
who have discharges from the eyes
are a great source of infection. One
having nasal catarrh should be care
ful not to let his handkerchief get
near his eyes. One third of the
blindness in the world is caused by
infection in childoood. Solution of
nitrate of silver may destroy the in
fection if used soon enough.
Dr. Eaton will give another lec
ture on eyes to the class to-morrow.
