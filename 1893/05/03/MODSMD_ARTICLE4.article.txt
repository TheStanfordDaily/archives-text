Our predictions as to success in
the first intercollegiate field day
were more thau fulfilled. Stanford
suffered a defeat from which she will
not recover for some time, and it
will be hard for her to forget that
she was beaten by such a large score
as 91 to 35,
The actions of Brown on Saturday
cannot be explained to any amateur
athlete. He acted worse than any
jockey possibly could, and certainly
would have been ruled off of any
race track if he had acted in the j
same manner. Ilia continual foul
ing of Powell in the mile race was
done in such a manner that the
referee could not rule him off' for it,
and yet it was more thau annoying
to Powell. His action in thus re-1
sorting to unfair tactics can be best
explained by his re mat k to Powell
after the race: "I kuew that I could
not win and I was bound that you
should not win the coast record."
Although thj 100-yavd dash was
a disappointment to us, we have not
lost our belief that Mays can beat
any amateur athlete on the coast for
nny distance from 75 to 4-10 yards.
His ruuniug iu the first heat was
sufficient to show us that he can
beat Bernhard if he is iu proper con
dition. Iu this heat he lost his
shoe on the 40-yard mark and ran
the rest of the distance with only
one shoe, finishing second. This
race made his foot very tender and
i • the finals his back gave way and
he fainted at the finish. Notwith
standing, he ran in the 220-yard
dash, finishing first He was not
able to run in the quarter m-le or
he would have given Maynard a
hard struggle for first place
Our committee did fine work in
making arrangements and in arrang
ing the program, but they made one
bad mistake which future commit
tees and managers must be careful to
avoid. We refer to the barring of
post graduates from entering the
field day.
If we should continue any such
arrangement it would mark us as a
college and not as a University. Our
professional schools are becoming
more and more graduate schools
every day, and it is against all jus
tice and right to bar them from our
athletics, especially since they are
eligible to become members of the
Athletic Association.
. . . Their decision gave the
victory to the negative and it is
popularly supposed that they gave
it to Stanford's aa a balm to their
injured feelings on account of their
overwhelming defeat of the after
noon. Seriously, though, it must
be conceded that the arguments of
the Stanford men wore more self
supporting and held together better
as a whole. On the other hand, it is
to be paid that the individual argu
ments of the Berkeley men were far
stronger than those of their oppo
nents but they showed little evi
dence of mutual support.
The Stanford boys began train
ing for next term's football this
week. —Occident, April 28th.
