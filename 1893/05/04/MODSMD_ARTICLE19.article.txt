The benefits to be derived from
having our team play baseball at the
World's Fair cannot bo over esti
mated. The te:im has been playing
ball pf the highest amateur order,
and they would undoubtedly make a
good showing against the crack east
ern teams if sent. Having gained
such a far-famed reputation, Stan
ford should by all means send her
representatives to contest for su
premacy on the diamond. Her ap
pearance is looked forward to by
many, and if the team fails to go it
will be a disappointment to the Uni
versity's supporters and an admir
able chance will thus be lost for
some legitimate advertising.
