The tennis tourhament in singles,
which was begun last Saturday, was
finished yesterday afternoon. There
were thirteen entries. In the pre

Chase, Smith bÂ°at Jones, Watson
heat Ivaetzsl, Cochran beat Magee,
and Morton beat Wright.
In the second round Chase beat
Smith, Watson beat Collier, Coch
ran beat Herrick, and Thompson
beat Morton.
In the semi-finals Chase defeated
Wat-:on, and Cochran defeated
Thompson Chase then defeated
Cochran, thus winning first place.
Smith and Cochran contested for
second prize, the former winning
after a close contest. Jones secured
third place
The first prize is a dozen tennis
balls, the second prize a racket case,
and the third a leather belt.
There was not much interest cx
cited by this tournament and tennis
seems to be in a pretty dead condi
tion. There will be no intercolleg
iate contest with Berkeley this year,
as tennis is in as backward a state
there as it is here.
