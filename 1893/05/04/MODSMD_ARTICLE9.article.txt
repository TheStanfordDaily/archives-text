# The 						Closing of the Telegraph Office.
## 
### 
Last Saturday evening Mr. Jaynes,
coast superintendent of the Western
Union Telegraph Company, sent or
ders to the Stanford University op
erator to close the office here and 1
notify patrons that no business
would hereafter be transacted. Tues
day the lineman of the company i
came and took the instruments out
of the office, so now we are depend
ent on Palo Alto for all our mes
sages.
This will make a great inconven
ience for all the students and pro
fessors liviug 011 the campus. Be
sides the delay which will be necess
itated by the bringing of a telegram
all the way from Palo Alto, there
will be a charge of at least twenty
five cents for delivery. All the
messages will probably be given by
the operator at Palo Alto to the bus
drivers to bring up, and it may even
be days before they are propetlv de
livered.
It is hard to understand why i>Jr. !
Jaynes ordered the office to be re
moved from here. He will certainly
not gain anything by it himself, and
we sustain a serious loss. The office
was getting to be one of consider
able impoitance, as its business was
constantly increasing ; and light
now at the close of the year it would
have been of more use to us than
ever.
It is true there has been some
complaint as to the way the office
has been run, but the students who
have had it in charge have done the
best they could under the circum
stances. A student who is taking a
full amount of University work can
not be expected to be at the key all
day as would a regular operator in
a larger office. And it should be
understood by all that if we have a
telegraph office here it must be run
by a student, as the business is not
sfficient to pay the Western Union
Company for sending down an oper
ator especially for this place.
Those who have been making com
plaints will now find out to their
sorrow that it was far better to have
the office as it was thau not at all. |
We are unable to state whether or
not Mr. .Jaynes intends to put the
office back here next fall. If not
some elVort at least, should be made
to induce him to do so. A tele
graph office has become a necessity
to us and next year with largely in
creased attendance, we shall feel the
need of it all the more.
