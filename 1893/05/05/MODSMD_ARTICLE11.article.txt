It has become quite the Ihing for
a number of students to come in late
to our regular Tuesday evening lec
tures and for fear the performance
will be repeated at the concert Mon
day evening, we desire to inform
these stragglers that those in attend
ance desire to listen to the music
and not to the squeak of their shoes
and rustle of their dresses.
Late coming to concerts and lec
tures for the mere sake of self dis
play shows a woeful lack of culture
and a narrowness of mind not sup
posed to exist within university
walls.
