# Dr. Eaton's Second Lecture on Eyes.
## 
### 
Yesterday Dr. Eaton concluded
bis lecture 011 "Eyes" before the
class iu Hygiene. He said that cold
applications are always productive

of good results when pl:ced upon
eyes which are troubled with dis
charges. The temperature is low
ered and there is a tendency to de
stroy the germs, which cannot live
in either a low or a high tempera
ture. These applications should be
changed frequently and never al
lowed to grow warm.
To illustrato what cold can do, a
New York physician look a patient
bjth of whose eyes were badly dis
eased, and treated one of them with
cold water alone and the other with
drops, such as solutions of nitrate of
silver, sulphate of zinc, etc. The
eye which was treated with drops did
not recover till long after the other.
Contrary to popular notion a
fine spray of cold water applied to
the eye is irritating; a coarse jet
should be used. Running water
lowers the temperature much faster
than an ordinary cold compress.
To clean an eye which discharges
use only boiled water mixed with a
little salt. Put in the e : e when
tepid.
Ventilation has much to do with
troubles of the eye. Poor ventila
tion causes little irritating grains
like --age to appear on the inner side,
of the eyelid. This is always cured
by a change to plenty of fresh air
The eye is connected with the nasal
pas-ages by the lachrymal system
Therefore nasal catarrh often ex
tends in its effects through contin
uity of tissue to the eye. Theie is
always lome trouble with the lacry
mal duct when one eye waters and
the other does not.
If a person has trouble with dis
charges the least scratch on the
cornea of the eye is liable to become
inoculated and the eye injured or
lost. Doctors never dare to perform
the operation for cataract on people
having discharges from eyes, as it
invariably leads to the destruction
of the eye.
The cornea is the transparent part
of the eye It looks like jelly, and
as if it were easy to pass the knife
through, but in reality it is very
tough aud hard to operate upon.
Between us and blindness lies the
integuity of the pupil, a space only
one-teuth or one-twelfth of an iuch
in diameter. It should be most
carefully guauled.
There is not sufficient importance
given to maintaining perfect sight in
both eyes. If the sight of one eye
becomes clouded or defective in any
way, the person loses the idea of
perspective or solidity.
Instruments used about the eye
should always be boiled in water or
kept for .some time in a solution of
carbolic acid.
