Dear Sir: May 1 tell you a lit
tle story? About six years ago a
young girl was left motherless. A
little property was bequeathed her,
and she set about tilting herself to
make a living as a music teacher.
By the jugglery of law the property
was taken from her and last year she
found herself penniless and unpro
tected in a great city. She bravely
took up the tirst work she could
find which happened to be washing
dishes in a large kitchen. Some of
us who know her courage, her abil
ities, her self reliance, aud the sweet
steadfastness with which she has
met her misfortunes, have taken it
upon ourselves to help her a little.
We have succeeded in obtaining
part of her expemes for this year at
a school of music in New York, and
now wish to raise money enough to
carry her thiough the year. She
will then be tit to take a place,
though a humble one, as a teacher
and will make her own way.
It has seemed that perhaps some
of the members of the University
might be glad to join in our en
deavors and we have planned a sim
ple entertainment to be given in the
chapel at 7:30 Thursday evening,
May 11 The tickets are for sale at
room 11 Roble Hall, loom S-"> Eu
cina Hall, the Comparative store,
and by me personally.
There aie many old songs, from
the times of Elizabeth and before,
of which all are quaint and interest
ing and some beautiful. Mrs. Smith
will sing some of these songs for us,
and 1 will talk briefly about their
history. Mrs. Smith will sing
"Chevy Chase," the ancient ballad
which, as Sir Philip Sidney says,
stirred his pulse like the sound of a
trumpet even when it was sung only
by an old blind "crowder" or stroll
ing minstrel, and we shall hear the
tune Sidney heard. She will also
sing some songs by Henry VIII, and
gome of the sweetest lyrics by
Shakspere and his contenjporaiies.
In English poetry, the
"Sphere born harmonious sisters, Voice
and Verse''
Have never since
"Wedded their divine sounds"
in so perfect a union as in the days
of Elizabeth; and these old lyrics,
sung to the tunes to which Henry
VIII, Elizabeth, Spenser and
Shakspere heard them, w.ll be new
aud delightful, I am sure, from their
spontaneous grace.
