# Alfred Wilkie's Concerts.

### 
Alfred Wilkie's third concert,
second series, at Maple Hall on
Thursday evening last was the most
successful and brilliant of the series.
The program was the finest which
has been offered to the public this
season, and ,as such, drew a large
and fashionable audience, completely
tilling the hall.
The quartet ' Beware" (Goodell),
by Messrs. Wilkie, Soiners, Stadt
feld, and Nielsen, was a bright com
position and was charmingly sung—
the blending of the voices was excel
lent. Miss Edna Groves, a young
soprano of whom we shall yet hear
good things, sang with Sedge'y Rey
nolds the veiy attractive duet "The
Unfortunate," by Saint Saens; they
were very warmly applauded for
their artistic singing. Mon?. Cre
paux's singing was delightful; the
rich and resounnt tone production
proved him to be an artist who will
be a valuable addition to our local
singers. He was warmly received
by his compatriots, aud his future
appearances will be looked forward
to with pleasurable anticipation
Balfe's "Come into the Garden,
Maud," was Mr. Wilkie's contribu
tion to this musical feast, and right
royally did he bing it. ("Maud"
must have been a stoic, indeed, could
she resist such impassioned wooing )
liis voice was in tine condition, and
he made this one of the most prom
inent numbers of the evening, fully
deserving the spontaneous and en
thusiastic applause and leeall for his
highly artistic rendering of this fa
vorite song.
Mrs. ?edgley Reynolds won an
immediate puccess, her singing in
the vernacular adding rather than
otherwise to her glorious contralto
voice, which is one of great promise;
making her also a valuable addition
to the ranks of our local singers.
Hawley's "Ah! 'Tis a Dream" re
ceived a highly sympathetic and ar
tistic rendering, winning a hearty
l'tcall, to which the responded by
repeating the song.—S. F. Daily
Report, Mar 4, 1803.
