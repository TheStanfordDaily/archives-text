# DEAF – MUTES DEFEATED.
## The 						Varsity Wins Anot'er Easy Game by a One-sided Score. Deaf Mutes 3, Stanford 21. 
### 
Another victory on the basebull
field has been added to our long
list for the season. Saturday after
noon at Recreation Park, San Jose,
the Varsity team crossed bats with
the boys from the Oakland Institute
for the Deaf and Dumb, and easily
bested them by the lop-sided score
of 21 to 3. The dummies were
clearly out-classed. Though they
Lave beaten the University of Cali
fornia team in five straight games
this ppring, they were unable to
make their score against us even
close enough to be interesting.
Their playing was very erratic. At
times they would put up the pret
tiest kind of work, but a minute
later they would spoil it all by a lot
of fumbling and muffing as rank as
that of the merest novices. They
must have been badly rati led by
coming up against strange players
on unfamiliar ground, as they usu
ally manage on their own diamond
to give a good account of themselves,
no matter who their opponents are.
had rather expected that they
would give us our hardest game so
far this season, and were disap
pointed that they did not give us a
much closer rub.
The game was settled right on the
start. As in the first inning, on a
combination of four hits, six errors,
a base on balls, and a couple of sac
rifices, our men managed to pile
up nine runs. The second netted
us only one tally, but in the third
inning the dummies took another
streak of error-making, and six more
runs were added to our credit.
After this, however, they steadied
down and played pretty good ba'l to
the end of the game.
There were few features in the
game worthy of mention. For the
dummies, Beck made two fine run
ning catches ot flics, and Daggett
covered the first bag in good style.
Isert and Hatch managed to mingle
some creditable infield work with
their errors, but their playing was
marked with unsteadiness
With the exception of some wild
throwing by Pauly and a juggled
grounder or two our men put up a
good all around game. They hit
well and stole bases on catcher Mur
phy with impunity, irheehan car
ried oft' the honors in the outfield,
and Itay and Davey on the iufield.

White played an errorless game at
first, but was very weak at the bat,
as also was Davey.
McLaine pitched his accustomed
steady game, allowiug but five hits
and striking out eleveu men. Wal
ton seemed to be rather out of form,
and did not play quite up to his
usual standard. As all ball players
do at limes, he experienced an off
day. However, his work has been
so tine all this season, both with the
stick and behind the bat, that we
cannot blame him for easing up now
and then in an unimportant game.
The dummies are a gentlemanly
lot of fellows and of course their
game is perfectly free from any noisy
kicking or coaching of any kind. It
is a novel sight to watch them as
they play without speaking a word,
only communicating with each oilier
by signs and gesticulations. The
umpire must use different motions to
denote balls and stiikes and it is
wonderful how little difficulty they
have in keeping track.
The crowd in attendance at the
game was very slim. Contrary to
our expectations, San Jose does not
seem to be much of a baseball town
after all.
