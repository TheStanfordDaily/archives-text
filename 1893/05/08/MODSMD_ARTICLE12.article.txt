It seems to be conceded that the
popular name for this university is
and will be "Stanford," instead of
the longer "Leland Stanford Jun
ior," or the"L. S. >J. IT." As was
mentioned recently in the Srquoiit,
no disrespect is implied in thus short
ening the name, for the name of
this University will ever be associ
ated with the thought of these who
founded it in memory of their only
son.
But in using the shorter and more
forcible name the error of calling
the University "Stanford's" should
not be fallen into. We never think
of saying "Yale's" or "Harvard's."
The use of the possessive case sounds
too much like a proclamation of in
dividual ownership in a money-mak
ing institution, and Stanford Uni
versity, endowed us it is by the
founders without any thought of per
sonal gain, but at a dauy expense to
itself of close to a thousand dollars,
cannot be considered a money mak
ing institution.
