# Alaska and Its Purchase.
## 
### 
Mackintosh, '95, delivered a re
port before the classes in History
IV. this morning upon the discovery
and early history of Alaska. Capron,
'913, read his repoit before the same
classes. He gave an interesting ac
count of the purchase of Alaska by
the United States, and told, what is
not generally known, of the suppo
sition, fouuded on hearsay only, that
the sum of $7,000,000 paid to Rus
sia in 18(>7 was really in return for
the timely presence in Boston har
bor just before the battle of Gettys
burg of quite a number of Russia's
best men-of-war ; and that their
presence probably intimidated the
British ships then lying off the coast
of the southern states, and pre
vented them from openly assisting
the sctr.hern confederacy.
