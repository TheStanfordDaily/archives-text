# Sunday Services.

### 
The Sunday morning services were
led by Rev. "William Racier of Oak
land. He took his text from John
xii: "And T, if 1 be lifted up from
the earth, wi 1 draw all men unto
me."
These words signified what man
ner of a death he should die. His
apostles had no idea of the spiritual
mear.iug of this prophecy. They
thought that aftei his face had dis
appeared his power would come to
an end. But to day the wonder of
the world is the fulfillment of this
prophecy.
In order to understand the illus
trious history of the church aud the
magnetism of Christ we must under
stand Christ. A man who has been
willing to die for his faith has pos
sessed magnetism. He revealed the
fatherhood*bf God, who is more the
father of the individual than the
creator of the universe.
How do we knjvv God loves us?
We find answer in the significance
of the crops. Truth of love is sacri
tice. We find love of God in nature,
beauty, aud sublimity. Man may
see all the beauties by which he is
surrounded and yet, like Poe aud
Byron, sink into the depths of dark
ness. Love is nature, but no sacri
fice.
There is something in the death
aud resurrection of Christ that lifts
man up aud makes him a new crea
ture. The power of redemption
over the world is the greatest thing
to be found. Christ came from
above, not below. The religion is
divine because he was supernatural.
Truth makes it conquer. Anyone
lacking faith is out of sympathy with
the culture of the world.
