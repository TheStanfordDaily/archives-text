Judging from the present status of
affairs, our cinder track will not he
ready for use Ã¼btil the University
opens again next September. We
have been led to believe from the
work done and tbat projected that
this will be one of the finest tracks
in the country, and steps should be
taken soon to insure a fitting open
ing. The best plan would probably
be to give a grand field day open to
all amateur athletes in the state, of
fering medals valuable enough to in
duce them to take part. In this
manner our track would become well
known to all reputable clubs, and in
a very stoit time they would be
sending all their speedy men to try
for records here.
