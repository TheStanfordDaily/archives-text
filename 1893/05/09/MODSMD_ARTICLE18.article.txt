In view of tho fact that wo have;
such a flourishing organization here i
as the University Band, would it not
be a good idea to utilize it upon the
occasion of tho Santa Cruz excur
sion? The band boys havo well
merited such a trip a-i this by their
hard woik to place the organization
on a firm footing, aud the students
would be repaid n hundred Cold in
listening to the music discoursed.
As the members of the band hive;
never asked a cent from anyone to i

defray their expenses so fur incurred
for music, promenade concert, etc., I
the students should respond liber-j
ally to the subscription list which
will be staited immediately to raise
money enough to purchase eighteen
railroad tickets for them.
