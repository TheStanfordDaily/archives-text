### 
The concert given in the chapel
last night was the best of the season
Frank H. Belcher in the "Armorer's
Song" (Robin Ilood), Miss Char
lotte Gruenhagen in the violin solo
"Fantasie," and Mrs. A. L. Guller
eon as pianist, won rounds of ap
plause from the audience. It is a
pity that so few first class musical
entertainments are afforded the stu
dents here.
