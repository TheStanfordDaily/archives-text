The team is doing some hard work
pending the decision as to whether
the World's Fair trip will be taken
or not, and we have every reason to
believe that they will make a cred
itable showing when they come up
against the eastern teams. Prof.
Augell has been askad to take
charge of the team on this trip and
is taking a great deal of interest in
the team. He was out on the cam
pus this afternoon coaching them.
The boys will play the Olympic
Maroon? of San Francisco next Sat
urday afternoon at 2 o'clock, on the
home grouuds. As this is only the
second game of any note scheduled
lor the home grouuds this year, a
large crowd will be on hand.
