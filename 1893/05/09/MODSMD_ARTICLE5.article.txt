The aims <oughl in the establish
ment of this station for biological
work are fhainly:

in the regular courses of instruction
in the zoological, botanical and
physiological departments of the
University under the favorable con
ditions. of such a station.
(2) To afford an opportunity to
those, especially teachers, who de
sire to become acquainted with
marine animals and plants, and to
learn the practical methods of their
study.
(3) To provide facilities for inves
tigators who are prepared to make
researches in marine biology, i'or
which the Pacific coa9t offers excep
tional attractions, in that its field is
very rich and is as yet largely un
worked.
The courses of instruction are
under the supervision of the direct
ors: Dr. Charles 11. Gilbert, profes

will consist mainly of a comparative
study of the principal groups of
fresh water and marine algte, with
