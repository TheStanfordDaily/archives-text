# Another Excursion East.
## 
### 
Among the homeward bound
parties being made up for the east
is one which will start for Chicago
via Portland during commencement
week. It will take the Shasta route
north in order to get the magnificent'
scenery about Mt. Shasta, then take
a half day's ride by boat through
the palisades of the Columbia as far j
as the Dalles. The scenery along
the Columbia surpasses by far that
of the Hudson river. The party
will stop over one day at Shoshone
Falls, two hundred and ten feet in
height. A free excursion is to be
given the party from the main line
to visit Salt Lake City and Garfield
Beach, Utah, after which it will
go on through the Rockies to Chi
cago. It will require five days for'
the trip.
