Dr. Frank Eaton gave a scientific 1
lecture on the eye, its organism ami
abuse, in the chapel last evening.
He explained iu full the difference
between the oculist aud the optic- j
iau. The optician iu relation to
the oculist is exactly as the apothe
cary to the medical practitioner. A
specialty arises from necessity aud â– 
not from expediency. Siuce the I
pursuit of a specialty tends to nar
row a person, the oculist should:
guard himself aguinst that. He
should have a good understanding j
of anatomy, as the eye is so depend
ent 011 the general health. Knowl
edge is derived from general prac
titioners. John Hutchinson's books
are c'assics in the medical profes
si n. One hundred years ago
Thomas Young discovered that the
refraction of the eye is different iu
different directions. The double
lens spectacles were lire invention
of Benjamin Franklin.
It is necessary to direct our atten
tion to the object in order to see it.
Among the questions asked a pa
tient are his family history, age,
state of health, and habits ot life.
In the case of children the food they
eat often injures the eye. Bandages
are used simply to keep the eye
closed. In the use of cold water
the cloth should not be alllowed to
become heated, for as soon as it does
'
it acts as a poultice. We constantly
see double, and were it uot so we
would have no conception of space
or distance. Nature enables us to
suppress the double form Psy
chology has much to do with the
proper use of our functions. The
focusing of the eye is done by a mus-
I cle. The adjustment is a muscular
act Objective methods are used, as
well as subjective, iu testing the eye.
Most people are born far-sighted,
but this is ordinarily outgrown.
The optician's work is to give the
patient the glasses with which he
can see most clearly, and these are
