It is rumored that some sort of a
rush is being planned to discomfit
the University JJand to-morrow
night and break up the promenade
concert. Should the least inten
tional disturbance mar the enter
tainment so kindly prepared by the
members of the band, a diligent
effort will be made to apprehend the
offenders. Friendly class contests
are all right in their proper place,
but such a demonstration would be
a disgrace to those who took pare in
it.
