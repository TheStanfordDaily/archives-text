There is soon to be a United
States postoffice on the campus.
Now comes the question, ""What shall
be its name? Have we not the first
right to the name Palo Alto it we so
desire? Did not Senator Stanford
once serve an injunction upon the
land owners on the north side of the
railroad track to prevent them from
advertising land tor sale in "Palo
Alto" because it caused strangers to
form the incorrect idea that the Uni
versity domain was being cut up
into town lots and sold as a real
estate scheme on the strength of the
University boom? or are we misin
formed? If it would be moie con
venient to call the new pof-toffice

"Stanford," or "Stanford Univer
sity," cr some other name, would we
still be known to the world as Stan
ford University, PuloAlto, or must
we abandon the name first and now
universally associated with the Uni
versity and the great farm on which
the c impus is located?
