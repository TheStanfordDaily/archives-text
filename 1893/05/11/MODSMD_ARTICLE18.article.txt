One of the best uses to which the
interioi of the oval could be put
would be a first class football field.
The large open space should be
kept clear of shrubbery in order to
preserve an unobstructed view of
all parts of the track, but sod could
be planted and a useful and beauti
ful field secured, i'ast experience
has shown that the place is not
suited for a baseball ground as the
curbing obstructs the outfielders.
If the gieat annual game is to be
played Thanksgiving day, some pre
paration .should be made to secure
a suitably soft field for practice
when the next semester opens.
