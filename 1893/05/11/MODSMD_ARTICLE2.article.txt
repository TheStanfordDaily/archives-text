For the purpose of stimulating
independent investigation in the fu
ture financial policy of the United
States, President, Jordan offers a
cash prize of fifty dollars for the best
discussion of the effects, financial,
social, and political, of the adoption
by the United States government
of the financial policy proposed in
Senator Stanfoid's land loan bill
The essay may be unlimited in
length, must he an impersonal dis
cussion, and the conclusion may be
either for or against the bill. Can
didates must have their essays
ready by April 1 1894. All de
tails of the contest are left with a
committee consisting of Professors
Warner, Ross, and Clark, who will
also choose the judges. The com
petition is open to any student of
good standing in the University at
the time the essiy is presented.
Something of the character of the
land-loan bill may be gained from
its title: A measure "To provide the
government with means sufficient to
supply the national want of a sound
circulating medium." It was first
presented before the United States
Senate by Senator Lelaud Stanford
of California January 21, 1892, and
was debated in the Senate on four
occasions-: during the Mat Congress.
()n March 30,1892, Senator Stanford
offered another bill in the Senate,
rather as an auxiliary to his previous
land-loan bills. Its title reads:
"That the value of 25.8 grains of
gold shall be the standard by which
shall be measured and determined
the value of a dollar, and all dollars
shall he received and paid out in dis
charge of debts, both public and pri
vate, at par, measured by the afore
said standard of value, whether the
stamp of the government making the
dollar be on gold, silver, paper, or I

any other material Section '2 That
the legal-tender value of each
dollar issued by the United States
depend alone on the stamp of the
government, and theie shall be no
obligation on the part of the gov
ernment to exchange one dollar for
another."
For those who may desire to try
for this prizs, attention is called to
the bound volumes of the Congres
sional Records in the library, and to
printed circulars on the bill itself.
Any advice or additional informa
tion on the subject may be obtained
from the committee.
