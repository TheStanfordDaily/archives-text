# Railroad Transportation.

Mr. Bissell lectured before the
class in railroad problems this morn
ing on railroad transportation. He
gave a short account of his railroad
career. Beginning as a messenger
in 186-1 he has since been connected
with the Gould ays>tem, Ceutral Pa
citic, and the Santa Fe.
Mr. Bissell first fully described
local traffic, explaining all t':e oper
ations from the time the freight is
left at the freight sheds until it i<
safely deposited at its destina'ion.
The intricacies of transcontinental
traffic were likewise made clear.
The old system of settling the ac
counts between different roads has
been supplanted by one not unlike
a clearing house whereby it is possi
ble to avoid much trouble and ex
pense.
Some articles of transportation,
such as tea, raw silk and sealskins,
are so valuable that their is great
lisk in transporting them, and many
times railroads must pay for the
damage to goods when the claims
are not just. Competition between
railroad makes this necessary. Seal
skins that formerly went direct from
San Francisco to London, now go
over the Northern Pacific, showing
that that road is becoming a factor
in transportation.
Staple goods seem to have their
particular market â€”that is, wool goes
to Boston, tea to New York, and
coffee to St. Louis. Some wool
from Australia is sent overland from
San Francisco, but the greater part
goes direct by vessel to Boston.
Mr. Bissell concluded by giving
an account of the efforts of railroads
to secure return freight, for there is
always great expense attached to
hauling back empty cars. The lec
ture was purely practical but very
entertaining and cleared up many
points for the students
