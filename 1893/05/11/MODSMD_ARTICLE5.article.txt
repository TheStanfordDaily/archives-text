The Class of '95 .is hereby chal
lenged to a game of baseball to be
played on or before May 20tb.
J. B. Frankenheimer,
Baseball Manager '9G.
The above was handed in this
afternoon by Manager Franken
heimer. He is making great efforts
to bring about a game between the
sophomore and freshmen classes be
fore the close of this semester, and it
is hoped he will succeed.
There have been few opportuni
ties for seeing baseball on the
campus this season, and as a conse
quence the students are losing the
active interest in the sport which
they phonld have. There is nothing
wLich would be calculated to arouse
this interest again more than a class
game, especially between '95 aud
'95, which are supposed to be the
most uncompromising rivals in every
thing. Besides, it would develop a
stronger class spirit, of which out
siders say we have little. Both
professors and students get more
solid ecjoyu.ent out of a game of
such local interest than even from a
game in which the Yursity team
plays outsiders
The two classes have met once
already this year and the freshmen
were badly defeated, but they have a
much better nine now, and they
hope to be able in another contest to
wipe out the odium of defeat If
the two teams come together a
highly interesting contest may be
looked for.
