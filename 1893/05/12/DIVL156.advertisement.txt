One of the most attractive places in Chicago
during- the World's Columbian Exposition will
be Hotel Endeaovr. The grounds cover
fully six acres. It is situated on the Beach of
Lake Michigan, seven blocks south of the Fair
Grounds, and is a veritable summer resort in
itself. Its strong points are: (1) Beautiful loca
tion. (2) No advance room rent. (3) Unique
plan, simular to Grand Union, at Saratoga—
every room being an outside room, none open to
narrow courts. (4) Prices even lower than any
other first-class Hotel. These prices aro
SI.OO per day each person for rooms (meals on
the European plan) for those who hold Advanced
Register Tickets. These Tickets are $3 each,
and will command a premium next summer.
Double the above prices will be charged to those
who do not hold Register Tickets.
Secure your Ticket at once, as capacity of Ho
tel is limited, and rooms are being' taken verv
rapidly.
Send Register fee to J. R. Chapman, Treas.
La Salle and Madison Sts., Chicago. When
remitting please see that
