Edgar A. Soper as been appointed
pystmaster, and his term of office
will last at bast during Piesident
Cleveland's adminisliation. Mr.
Soper is at present and has baen for
some lime station agent at Meulo
Park, und it is due principally to his
efforts that the effi ;e has been se
cured, although necessity demanded
that it should come soon. He will
very probably resign his position
with the Southern Pacific and de
vote a large part of his li ne to the
duties of his new office.
As soon as the office is in readi
ness, and the work will be pushed
with all haste, all the mail of the

fices now in the registrar's office, En
cina, and Roble will be done away
with. A large number of lock
boxes will be provided for individu
als and for clubs. Should the busi
ness of the office be sufficient to war
rant it, assistants will very likely be
selected from among the students.
