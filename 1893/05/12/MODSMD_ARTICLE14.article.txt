A lar<;e crowd should take advan
tage of the opportunity offered them
next Monday of seeiDg at a very
reasonable cost one of the most
beautiful parts of California. The
country through which the excur
sion train will pass is well worth
going a long way to see, and the
perfect weather we have been enjoy
ing for the past few weeks will add
materially to its beauty.
No student can aU'oid to let this
opportunity pass, but eastern stu
dents in particular should go on the
txcursiou, as they may never again
have the opportunity.
