At ihe meeting yesterday evening
Messrs. Ashley and Purdue gave
interesting talks on the ancient
lakes Lohontan and Bonneville.
These two lakes are said to have ex
isted from 5,000 to 8.000 years ago,
during the quaternary period.
Lake Lohontan, including in its
basin part of western Ntvrda, Ore
gon, and California, contained an
area of 8,200 square miles and was
bounded by the Sieira Nevada
mountains on the west and other
ranges on the north and east. Ge
ologists have endeavored to seek
au outlet to this lake, but have as
yet not been successful. The ter
races formed by ihe gradual settling
of the waier stand 530 feet above
the level of Pyramid Ink-.
The basin of Lake Bonneville con
tains Great Suit Lake of Utah, and
also Lakes Sevier and Utah. It
contains an area of 5-I,OUO square
miles. In the northern part of the
basin is a pass 375 feet below the
old level of the lake. This pass has
been a problem to geologists but
has been satisfactorily explained by
the fact that at the time the lake was
at its greatest height the pass was
tilled with alluvial soil, and the
water rising over the top washed a
small gap in the pass and finally
the whole pass was washed away till
the hard rock was reached.
