There was an interesting debate
iu the History IV. class this morn

San Francisco." Messrs. Bledsoe

proceedings of the Vigilance Com
mittee were justifiable, while Messrs.
Sheldon and Giith held that they
were not. This is the second class
room debate that has been held at
Stanford, and surely ttiey have both
been a success.
