# Lecture on "Old English Ballads."
## 
### 
List evening Prof. Lathrop gave j
a very enjoyable lecture in the chapel
on ' Old English Ballads," which
was charmingly illustrated by Mrs.;
A. W. Smith.
"Poetry," said Mr. Lathrop, "be
longs with and originated with music
and dancing. The three arts—
. . I
poetry, music aud dancing —were
once united as a single art. <i rad
ically they were separated; but at
first they were inseparable." lie
also spoke very interestingly on the
ballads of the time of Henry VIiI,
aud of the Elizabethan age.
Nobody sings, "Take, 0 take
those lips away," "Drink to me only
with thine eyes," or that old ballad,
"Wapping old stairs" (which Thack
eray tells us Colonel Newcome
so charmingly) nowadays. No, the
majority of the people piefer such
dainty morcmux a3 "I wonder if
Ireams come true " Dorothy aud
Phyllis have given place to Annie
Rooney aud Mary Green.
Mrs. A. \V. Smith sang a number
of old ballads, among them "The
Maid of Islington" and"The Wil
low Song." In both of these songs
she saug with that intelligence, ar
tistic sense and delicacy of phrasing
which has made her ballad sin"iu£r
C O
so popular E If.
