We spoke editorially once before
of the abuse liable to arise when one
person is allowed the privelege of
reserving as many seats as he desires
to an entertainment where seats are
in much demand. For the sake of
emphasizing this matter and in the
hope that much trouble will be
avoided next year by a little care
now, we desire to repeat that one
person should be able to reserve
only a limited number of seats.
This suggestion is made necessary
on account of the manner in which
some seats were disposed of to-day.
