The last meeting of E uphionia for
this semester was held on Saturday
evening. The program for the even
ing was as follows: An impromptu
debateâ€”Resolved, That a protective
tariff is beneficial to the United
States. Mr. Sandwick argued for
the affirmative and Mr. Dodd the
negative. Mr. Brown delivered a
very interesting declamation. The
regular debate was on the question,
"Are large cities, considered within
themselves, more of an evil than a
good?" The affirmative was repre
sented by Messrs. Tuber and Bledsoe
and the negative by Messrs. Foster
and Tobie.
Euphronia has been organized
only four mouths, but has prospered
remaikably well. Its members are
all active and in earnest, and though
doubtful at first of the success of the
undertaking, they may now be as
sured tho society has a bright future.
