# Sunday Services.

### 
The Sunday morning services were
led by Rev Horatio Stebbins of San
Francisco. The twen'.y - seventh
psalm of David was to sustain him
in his faith, in his joy, and penitent
agonies. It is the utterance of a
tempestuous spirit—the voice of hu
man nature. I.'avid roused h'sspliii

to carry out liis couvictions. The
moral of Lis prayerful struggle is its
courage. Courage is an essential of
faith. Flat contradiction stands in
the face of faith. The sensuous na
ture continually contradicts the spir
itual. Mortality, cries one; immor
tality, cries the other. You behold
your friend dead before you —a tes
timony of terrible force; God, whis
pers the heart; earth, air, no God in
sight, say the senses.
Fai h says that God is good; the
senses point to the murder and
crime of the world and ask, What
is goodness? Every affirmation of
the soul is made in the face of flat
denial. How is it that the soul af
firms anything? What brings about
this defiance of the senses? Men
trust their senses Senses oppose
faith, aud yet he universally and tri
umphantly believes. The senses arc
crude and must b3 tamed. Men
seldom see alike, and still each will
say, I saw it with my own eyes, with
like assurauce
Not until the senses are subordi
nated to reason do they give a ttue
report. What is plainer to the
senses than that the earth is station
ary? To the savage nothing could
be more incredible than the compo
sition of water. He confides in his
senses literally, and he is tbei
dunce. Put a stick in water, place
a woild far oft' as the stars —and jet
we say we believe our own eyes!
Eye and ear do not work accurately
when left to themselves; we must
learn the law of their perceptions,
and subject them to tie sway of
reason.
While the senses are limited the
higher powers of man have extraor
dinary soundness. The laws of
reason always hold. Gravitation is
but God in the universe. Let the
soul act with authority and you have
knowledge, creation, God. Let the
senses, and you have a dance of
chattering apes.
Every epoch of history is an epoch
in the belief of man. Why now the
belief in senses, and the timidity to
go beyond their sphere? Man is
bom a perfect animal, but a rudi
mentary soul. Great spiritual dar
ing must go with noble belief. One
of intrepid heart can believe greatly
and proudly.
This University, bo: 11 in giLf, was
erected in gratitude. Over it floats
the victorious banner of humanity.
The walks are thronged with the
devotees of truth, here to learn that
the soul of man is larger than the
sky, deeper than the ocean. It is
enough for the founders to know
that they are the instruments of
providencG.
