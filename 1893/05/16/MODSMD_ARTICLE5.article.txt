# The 						Olympic Maroons Beaten in a Well Played Game
## 
### 
The Olympic Maroons, represent- j
ing the well known Olympic Am-!
ateur Athletic Club of San Fran
cisco, were defeated by our team
last Saturday with very little trouble,
by the score of 11 to 2.
For the Olympics, Pitcher Laugh
lin was very wild at times and
Nealon was unable to hold him.
Outside of this, however, they put
up a good fielding game. Bradley
at the tLird base did some of the
best infield playing ever seen on our
grounds, and liight Fielder Martin,
after a hard run, made a phenome
nal one handed catch cf Sheehan's I
long tly.
The Olympics did not show up
very well at the bat, only manag
ing to make five hits off Campbell.
Their two runs were secured in the
fifth inning, when they made four
hits in succession and our men
helped them along by kindly throw
ing in ocouple of errors.
(>n our side, the batting was not
so heavy as might have been ex
pected, but enough base stealing
was done to make up for it. Lewis
gave a line exhibition of base run
ning, as he managed by daring slid
ing to steal five bases.
Campbell pitched a rather erratic
game, allowing seven men to walk
to first and hitting three, but he
usually steadied down with runners
|on bases and retired the side.
I'auly distinguished himself by mak
ing a brilliant catch of a difficult
foul, and Ilarrelson made a beauti
ful throw from left field, shutting ofi'
a man at the plate.
Following is the score:
