The recent action of the Athletic
Board iu supplanting Manager
Grove by the election of a new man
ager for the occasion of the baseball
team's proposed trip to the World's
Fair, besides being a violation of
the constitution of out Athletic As
sociation, is a most peculiar method
of thanking Mr. Grove for the time
aud labor of which he has been un
sparing in gaining for the Univer
sity a baseball season long to he re
membered
In the baseball contests at Chicago
we will meet eastern universities in
the athletic fit-Id for the first time,
and our reputation east of the
Rockies will depend, for some time
at least, iu no small degree upon the
impression which our team makes
this summer. Now, while it may be
quite the correct thing fora pre
paratory school or a small college to
have one of its instructors in charge
of its baseball team for purposes of
advice aud counsel, we need never
expect such universities as Yale, Har
vard, Johns Hopkins, Michigan,
etc., to consider us their equals if
they see our team eliapeioued in this
manner.
On the other hand, with all due
respect to our faculty, the position
of baseball manager of the L. S.
-Jr. U., while quite an important of
fice among the students, scarcely
appeals to be in keeping with the
dignity of one of their number.
