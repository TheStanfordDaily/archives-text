John G. Doyle of Menlo Park de-j
livered the lecture in the chape l yes
terday eveniug. His subject, which'
he treated iu a most interesting and
instructive manner, was"The Dis-1
covery and Exploration of the Santa
Claia Valley." It has been char
acterized as one of the best lectures |
ftiven here this year.
California was iirst colonized by j
the Jesuit missionaries of Spain,
who were recalled to Home in 1767
and were replaced by the Franciscan
friars. In 1769 on July 14th a party
of sixty-one persons started from San
Diego up the coast in search of Mori-1
terev to found a mission. This was
the first real exploration of the coast
of California.
In 1602 Monterey had been dis
covered by a Spanish explorer, who
gave a most highly-colored descrip
tion of the bay and surrounding
country. In 1603 the schooner St.
Augustine was wrecked in San
Francisco bay. Nothing more was
heard of this bay for 166 years. Its
very existence was doubted.
The expedition of 1769 was a very
hazardous one. With no resources
and but scantily supplied they were
pushing into a country unknown, its
inhabitants as savage as Apaches.
It was a march of some eight or nine
hundred miles, a small detachment,
being sent in advance to make the
way while the ot ers followed. They
thus made from three to four St anish
leagues a day. They have been fol
lowed by means of tho diaries of
Father Crispi and of the engineer,
which arc preserved in the Sutro
Library, Fan Francisco.
They reached Half Moon bay, hav
ing failed to recognize Monterey.
Their provisions were half con
sumed and their numbers greatly
reduced. Thev re-discovered San
Francisco bay, and as the winter
was coming on they began their
retreat Nov. 11th, passing down the
valley. Tin it* fir->t camp was near
S.in Mateo. Their march can be
tiaced along 'o their hist camping

placr, which whs near the present
site of this Uuiv< rsity. Thev toiled
pniufully down tie coast arid before
leaving Monterey, Dec. 0, 17(>9,
they erected a memorial in the form
of a cross on I hejsoutli side oi' Point
Pinos. At lie foot of this cross
they buried a letter describing their
explorations and begging that the
finder follow them down the co ist,
as they were in great need of acf-is
tince.
