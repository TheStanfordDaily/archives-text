'96's pride was taken down from j
the Mayfield flag pole last night by
three '95 men. The heavy wind j
that prevailed rendered the first
attempts with fire brands fastened i
to the haliards partly unsuccessful
and extremely dangerous to the
safety of the town, as the flying
sparks from the fire ball and from
the flag itself blew out over the
town, aud in one instance caught
fire to a roof. The authorities pro
tested against the further use of
fire, and an immense scythe blade
was hoisted up with a lantern tied
near it to direct its movements.
Some time after midnight the dis
mantled ilag was cut and burned
loose, for the lantern exploded a id
fired the rope It is now in pos
session of the '93s who, with the
people of Mayfield, secretly rejoice
that it is down.
