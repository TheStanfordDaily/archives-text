Senator Edmunds of Vermont,
who visited the University yesterday,
was one of the men who was so
active in the impeachment of An
drew Johnson, and sided with
President Graut against Charles
Sumner. At the National Republi
can Conventions held in Chicago in
18S0 and 1881 he received thirty
four and ninety-three votes respec
tively for the presidential nomina
tions, each on the first ballot. He
served as president of the U. S.
Senate after Mr. Arthur became
president of the United States.
As a legislator Senator Edmunds
is noted for his legal acumen, his
readiness in repartee, and his love
of strictly paHiamentary procedure.
He has been a fearless foe of politi
cal jobs and legislative intrigues.
In 188G he was a leader in the senate
in the attempt to compel President
Cleveland to furnish that body with
necessary proofs to show cause for
recent removal from office.
