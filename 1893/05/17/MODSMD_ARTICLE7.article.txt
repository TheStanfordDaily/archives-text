# Oakland High School Notes

### 
The O. H. S., by ber victory on
the 20th of April, has probably won
the last field day to le given by the
A. A. A. A. Interest among tbo
several schools is certainly dying
out. Hardly 300 people attended
the last field day, and they all left
tbe grounds at tie end of the per
formance perfectly'Jdisgusted with it.
Tbe unfavorable state of tbe weather
bad something to do with it, but
tbe almost total absence of well
trained athletes was too apparent
not to be noticed on any day. Ellis
of the .NT. T. M. A., Humphrey of
the 13. G., Wyckoff and Oliver of
the O. H. S., were tbe only con
testants who made a creditable
showing.
Still the 0. H. S. won the field
day as well as the football champion
ship, and as a consequence feels
compensated for the loss of tbe
baseball trophy.
Graduation comes off on the
2">th inst. at tbe First Con
gregational Church. I'rof. How
inson of the U. C. will deliver the
address. Tbe largest class that ever
graduated from the high school will
sit on the stnge that night. Three
essays and two orations by members
of the graduating c'ass and three or
four musical numbers will constitute
tbe program.
Several of tbe boys outside of tbe
graduating class intend to try the
U. C. examinations on tbe 18th, and
some are quite confident of passing
them,
