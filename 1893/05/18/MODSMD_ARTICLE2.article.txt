# Miss Aus der Ohe's Concert.
## 
### 
The concert announced by Miss
Adele Aus der Ohe took place iu the
chapel last night before an audience
that completely tilled the building.
The program was arranged with
much good taste, being both cath
olic and representative. It con
tained the illustri >us natr.es of Beet
hoven, Schubert, Schumann, Men
delssohn, and Chopin, while only a
rhapsody by Liszt represented that
concession to virtuosity which great
executants are expected to make.
Beethoven's Sonata, op. '27, no. 2,
in C sharp minor, was the opening
number and it was superbly played.
The first movement, which was es
pecially artistic in conception, was a
model of unaflected nnd clean in
terpretation. Schubert's "Moment
Musicale" seemed a fanciful im
provisation of the moment drop
ping capriciously from her fingers
rather than a memorized composi
tion. Schumann's "Carneval," op.
0, which is a most t-ying number,
was played with clearness and truth

of expression, no trace of exaggera-1
tion being visible.
The program, which contained a
composition by the player, ended
with Liszt's Rhapsody No. 12, which
is the least noisy of the set.
Miss Aus der Ohe's playing
throughout was that of a thoughtful
musician. Nothing was done for
effect only and the tempi were most
admirably selected.
Professor Goebel is to be com
mended for his untiring efforts to
secure Miss Aus der Ohe fora
recital. Iv 11.
