With to-day's issue, the hi-1
of tbe semester, the {resent
board of editors closes its term of
office. We have doubtless iu many
instances made mistakes In some
degree they are excusable in an
undertaking new, strange and devoid
of tbe experience of a long line of
able predecessors to guide us. We
have always tried to encourage
whatever partook of a conservative,
broad-minded, manly poMcy, and
endeavored to discouiage tbe re
verse. In matters literary, athletic
and academic we have endeavored
to be fair and unprejudiced, work
ing only for the best interests of the
University. " 7 ros Triusqu•? mi hi
nulla dineriminc ayetur" has been
our motto. How far we have fallen
short of this criterion our faculty
and our fellow students, who have
so generously and willingly sup
ported us in times of uncertainty
are judges.
The Palo Alto was founded un
der conditions that were anything
but favorable. There were those
who declared that tbe University
was too small and the time had not
yet come when a daily paper was
needed. There were those who pro
claimed that the scheme would meet
with financial disaster in a short
time. Many other reasons were of
fered that the paper would prove a
failure. But in answer to all these
the paper itself is a living proof that
all the hue and cry against its found
ing were false and in vain. The
Palo Alto has found a field and has
come to stay.
The entire board of editors have
worked together harmoniously and
not in a single instance has ihtre
been the slightest friction on a ques
tion of policy. To the tssociate and
assistant editors the success of the
Daily I'alo Alto is mostly due To
them the editor-in-chief and business
manager wi*h to express their heart
felt thanks.
It is the sincere hope of all that
the Daily Palo Alto may win t! e
measure of plaudits in 181)4 that c
kind audience has awarded it iu tie
year of 180 U.
