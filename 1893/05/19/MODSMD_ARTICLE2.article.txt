### 
A corps of wotkmen are now put
ting the museum in thorough readi
ness for the collections which will
Ibe placet! in it during the summer
vacation. All the walls are to be
tinted in appropriate colors, and the
tiles throughout the building will
be painted red. Because of the
poor light, the room which was con
structed specially for the personal
collections of Leland Stanford Jr.,
there will be six new windows cut
in the wall. This with other im
provements are expected to be com
pleted in about two weeks, when
the actual work of unpacking and
setting up the rare collections will
commence.
It is Mrs. Stanford's intention to
remain liere all the summer and de
vote most of her time to the interest
of the museum. Prof. W. Miller,
assisted by two students in archeol
ogy, will be in charge of the work.
Among the valuable collections,
one is that of Gen. Cisnola of Ihe
Metropolitan Museum of New York,
which the British Museum was very
anxious lo secure. This collection
consists mainly oi pottery, images,
and terra cotta vases taken from the
excavations on the Island of Cypress.
There will be also a very valuable
Egyptian collection in the room on
the right hand side on entering.
The room on the left will bo given

entirely to paintings and statuary
collected by Senator aud Mrs. Stan
ford in their travels abroad.
Leland Stanford, Jr , was very
fond of archeology, aud during his
lifetime he made quite an extensive
collection. His room at his home |
in San Francisco, in which he him-,
self arranged his collection, will be
photographed; and everything will
be replaced in txactly the same or
der in his room in the museum.
Most of the rooms will be filled !
by the opening of next semester, ami
several courses in the study of arch
neology will be offered under Prof. |
W. Miller.
