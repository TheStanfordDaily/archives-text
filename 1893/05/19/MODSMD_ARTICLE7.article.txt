# '95 Defeats '96 in a Close Contest.
## 
### 
Yesterday afternoon the sopho-j
more and freshman baseball nines i
met in what proved to be the closest,'
most exciting and noisest game
played on the University grounds
The whole field was lined with an
enthusiastic crowd of spectators and
claS3 spirit was at a white heat.
A long intermission was taken at
one time to allow the players to en
gage in the class rush, which was
occasioned by the raising of a '00
flag among the spectators; but
though this delayed the game some
what, it only added to the excite
ment.
There was a great deal of kicking
at umpire Capron, and it must be
said that he was very erratic in his
decisions. Once or twice he came
near raising a small sized riot, es
pecially when he allowed the soph- j
omores to tie the score in the r inth
inning by calling Walton's double
a fair ball when it was evident to all
that it was foul by several feet
All the sophomore players aire
also on the Yaisity nine, and they
kept up their reputation for being
heavy hitters. This may 1 o seen
from the fact (hat they landed on
McLaine's delivery for twelve hits,
live of them being doubles and two
triples. They kept the lead till the
seventh inning, when the freshmen
passed them. When the sophomores
came to bat in the last half of the
ninth the score was <even to six
against them. Downing, the first
up, made a hit, but was forced at
second by Lewis. Walton then
made his doubtful two-bagger, scor
ing Lewis. Ilea followed with a hit,
Walton tallied—the game was won.
Ilea and Downing both played
their positions in line style, aud Har
relson made one of his brilliant
throws from left, shutting out a man
at first.
TLe freshmen were weak at the
bat, but they would have won the
game if they had done le.«s foolish
base running. Davey was strong and
accurate in his throwing aud caught
an excellent game. Johnson did
j good infield work but was rather
slow in recovering fora throw.
■ Paulv did great playing at second
and gained much applause by a run
ning pick-up of a difficult grounder.
