# The
						Intercollegiate Football Rules Changed.
## 
### 
At the annual meeting of the 111-
tercollegiate Football Association in
New York ou May Gth, the two rules
proposed by the Graduate Advisory
Board last March were adopted.
Tbe fiist of these provides that
hereafter the center rush whose side
is in possession of the ball shall have
absolute possession of it, instead of
half as heretofore, thus relieving the
game of the dilatory tactics em
ployed by men opposing center, and
will make a much faster aud more
interesting game.
The other change is that the
touchdown shall be made where the
bill is downed behind the line, thus
determining definitely a point in the
game much mooted duriug the sea
son, some claiming, among them
Walter Camp, that the ball should
be brought out fora trial at goal
from the point it wa r ; carried across
the liue. The iule now provides
otherwise.
