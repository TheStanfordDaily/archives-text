# LELAND STANFORD.
## Biographical Sketch of His Life. 
### 
L 'land Stanford was born March 9, |
182-1, at Elm tirove farm, near Water-!
vliet, on the thoroughfare leading from j
Albany to Schnectady, in the.state ol i
New York.
The family name is English, but the !
ancestors of Mr. Stanford have lived on
the continent since 1011. People bear-i
ing that name have generally been i
known as honest and straight forward. !
Lcland's father, Josiah Stanford, was j
! oru in Massachusetts, but when a
mere child moved to Alb my county,!
NYw York, lie was a thrifty farmer, i
but according to all accounts was plain |
;.nd unpretentious; yet a remarkable;
man, full of public spirit and capable S
of u r re:tt enterprises. Much cf his time
w is spent in building roads and bridges.
Central and western New York in his
day was a very promising field for
transportation enterprises. The Erie
.• mal was the most colossal undertaking
of that period, and Josiah Stanford was
one of its leading advocates when De-
Witt Clinton's project was very much
in need of friends. Leland Stanford's I
fit her was next attracted by the iuven-j
tinn of the locomotive, and was the:
foremost man in obtaining a charter fori
the \ibany and Schnectady Railroad. I
It i- said that lie took large contracts
for grading and pushed forward the!
work with the greatest vigor; and from j
t!i it day the Stanfords we re more or less
engaged in railroad building. ''One be
ll an on the first iron road built in the
'Hired States; and another, a son of
that pioneer, drove with his own hand,!
forty year* after, the last spike of the
first transcontinental railroad. It is!
in keeping within the boundaries of fact
to say that this fifteen mile railroad j
now forms 'one of the links in the!
thirty-three hundred mile road from
th • far east to the west."
Until Leland Stanford was twenty!
years old his time was spent on the (
farm and in the country school. The j
f»rm to such as he, instead <112 being a
drawback has been a benefit. It may I
be recognized as the best school in i
which the practical abilities of people
mi v be developed.
Undoubtedly much of this kind of
training shaped to a great extent the'
course adopted and successfully carried I
out by beland Stanford. Those who
knew him in boyhood speak of him as a
general favorite on account of his good :
sense, cheerfulness acd kindness—
characteristics that have been marked j
through his whole life, lie was, per- !
haps, a little impatient of purely scho-j
\ i-rio methods, which imposed too much i
indoor constraint upon a mind linked to
a body full of vigorous life that de
manded large liberty in the opon air.
l»ut a nature of this kind prefers to
«tudy out-doors rather than in-doors;
hence all material things became his
text-book, lie studied nature itself,
and he knew more of it than many re
puted authors. He was a keen and
discriminating observer of men and
things—an ability that fitted him for
the many great and responsible posit
ions he afterward held. As he took up
the higher branches he became remark
ably bright in physics, but abhorred
Latin and Greek, while geology and j
cli miwtry were special branches to I
which he devpted considerable time, i
!!;> could remember things, but was apt j
to forget words; his mind was stored
with facts, but not forms. In forming!
conclusions he made investigations for!
hiJuself j he always valued his J
opinion above that- of any one else>

j fie road much, listened to many lcc
; tures, but to all he learned he applied
J common sense. If what he had learned
did not tally with plain common sense
it was throwu overboard.
At twenty years of ape he entered
! the law firm ot Wheaton, Doolittle &
j lladley, an eminent firm in Albany. In
j 18-18, after carefully looking over the
: west fora location, he settled at i'ort
Washington, Wis. lie could as well
have gone to Chicago, but he then
j considered the prospects fora " boom "
lat I'ort Washington much better. Not
withstanding the disappointment, he
determined upon making this location
his home, and accordingly married a
; most estimable young 'ady, Miss Jane
Lathrop, daughter of Dyer Lathrop, a
merchant and old resident of Albany.
His professional life in Wisconsin was

not brilliant, but his friends, recogniz-:
ing his excellent judgment, made him
justice of the peace. Hair-splittingi
technicalities were distasteful to him,!
Hnd more than once he thought he hud
missed his calling. An event,« at
the time believed to be a misfortune, |
occurred in 1852 which, though]
small and seemiugly insignificant
to many, helped to change the:
course of his life. The event re-J
ferred to was a tire which swept away j
his law library. lie had never been,
thoroughly satisfied with his law prao-'
tice in Port Washington from the fact!
that it involved petty details rather
than principles. His tastes were always!
for things on a large scale. He had |
considered the idea of establishing a I
newspaper but the project was unsuc-j
cessful, and now that his law library,
was burned he decided to try his for-|
tune in California.
Arriving here in July, 1852, he.
joined his two brothers at Sacramento j
and soon took charge of a branch mer-i
cantile house of theirs at Michigan
Bluffs, Placer county Very successful
here, lie in a short time moved to Sac
ramento, where he gained greater repu-1
tation as a business man and firmly j
established himself as a man of affairs. |
lie made a science of commerce. Asj
carefully as the student in chemistry'

watches his experiments, did he keep
his eye on the movements of trade, the
laws of supply and demand, and what
ever legislation that ailected him.
When Mr. Stanford came to Sacra
mento iu 1856 lie was thirty-two years
old. lie had not yet acquired much
money, aud nearly all his investments
had been made in himself. Mr. Albert
Shaw, in the Review of Reviews, con
siders all of Mr. Stanford's life before
thirty-two as a preparatory course,
which he divides as follows : " From
sixteeu to thirty-two Stanford went
through four educational periods and
phases of about four years each. From
sixteen to twenty he was finding his
bent, accomplishing some general study,
chiefly in the elements of science, teach
ing school a little and earning the
money to pay for the next experience j

from twenty to twenty-lour he was in
Albany as a law student; t'roni twenty
four to twenty-eight he was a country
lawyer at Port Washington; and from
twenty-eight to thirty-two he was a
frontier merchant and iniuer iu Placer
county."
"With such an extended training in
the actual business of life he had not
failed to observe many details that
escaped the notice of tliose less scien
tific. Successfully launched in the
business world, he now began a politi
cal career at the state capital that did
not end till his death. 11 is thorough
knowledge of human natuie aided him
in politics as in business. He added
to his practical knowledge many of the
best theories in economics and sociol
ogy, as could be derived by reading
John Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencer
An ardent Republican, he was not to
be turned from his convictions on ac
count of the party being almost hope
lessly small. By his genial man nor and
the daring advocacy of his principles
he gathered around himself a following
that was not to be satis-lied until he was
placed iu such a position as tu make his
good qualities more widely known. He
Was first nominated in 1857 j or state
treasurer. Iu 1859 he was nominated
for governor. Both these honors were
purely titular, but they led the way to

his selection as a delegate to Chicago
for tlie National Republican Convention
of 1800, that nominated Lincoln. Ho
was an ardent admirer of Lincoln, who,
like himself, had had a varied carter,
but now gave promise of a man of
national recognition. The friendship
was mutual, for when Lincoln dcsiied
advice as to best methods of dealing
with the west he chose uo other than
Leland Stun ford. Without Mr. Stur
ford's knowledge his lricnds nominated
him again for governor. He was e!ce-\d
for this office in 1861. Many uiiiic lil
ies presented themselves, but the con
ciliatory measures adopted by then« w
governor quieted many disturbing fac
tions and finally placed California isn
disputably on the side of the Union.
A biographer has said that his grasp < 112
state affairs and the interest he took in
the promotion of Pacific const matter*
would have made him a noted governor
aside from the part he took in nation.il
polities. His messages to the legislat
ures were remarkable state papers. lie
helped to bring order into the finances
and cut down the state debt by half.
1 lis interest in education, afterward to
be so magnificently exemplified, was
shown by various efforts, among which
was the establishment of the State Nor
mal College.
As his gubernatorial term drew to a
close he, in company with C. I*. Hunt
ington, Mark Hopkins, and Charles
Crocker, began the construction of tho
Central Pacific. This company, of which
Stanford was president, was to receive
alternate sections of public land in a
belt five miles wide on either side of
the road and was to be granted 6 hi,ooo
I a mile in government bonds, to be se
cured by mortgage on the road. 33ut
the subsidies were to be made over only
upon the completion of' successive forty
j mile stretches, and the first forty mib i
was to be built within two years i'V-r
a while it was thought to be almost im
possible to build the road upon such
conditions, when the laud grant was
doubled and as much an $18,000 al
lowed fora mile in some of the inett
difficult places. After the work had
been completed and the great chances
of being bankrupted were over, thou
capitalists who did not have the nerve
j !o make the venture themselves or even
help, cried out against these four be
cause they had become mi.lionaires.
The work of each of these men was dif
ferent : Crocker looked after the con
struction, Hopkins to business details,
Huntington to financial management,
and Stanford to general supervision and
especially to legislation. On May 20,
1800, Governor Stanford drove the gold
spike which completed the liuej the
silver hammer which he used was ci n
uecte.d by a wire with the telegra; It
system of the country, and there flashed
to the remotest part of the land the gl; d
tidings that the Atlantic and Pacific
were united.
After the completion of the Central
Pacific Stanford devoted his time largely
to the management of his railroad in
terests till 1885. lu the mean time,
however, he had acted as president of
the Oriental k Occidental Steamship
Company, besides helping to establish
woolen mills and sugar manufactories,
and also spending considerable time in
agricultural and architectural pursuits.
Tlic greatest grief that ever came to
Mr. and Mrs. Stanford was in 1884,
when their only son, Leland Stanford
•Jr , aged sixteen, died in Italy. The
young man had an attractive nature, a
happy disposition, and possessed greftt
intelligence. Knowing that he would
some day fall heir to a great estate, he
had collected many cuiios, and hj.d

Mr. Stanford became a U. S. senator
