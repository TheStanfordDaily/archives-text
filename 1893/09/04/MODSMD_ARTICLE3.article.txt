# LELAND STANFORD
## 
### 
Lf.lasd Stanford was the friend of
every student in tlie land. To be sure
lie felt a warmer interest in those whom
he so often took pleasure in calling " his
hoys," but his broad minded generosity
never failed to lend a hand to every
earnest student.
Liberal both in his views and his purse,
he never failed to win the respect and ad
miration of all who knew him. His
early boyhood was marked by character
istics of kindness, honesty, gener
osity, and whatever tended toward
the betterment of his fellows. These
characteristics remained with him
through life. It was a real pleasure to
meet him. Hrs frank and genial manner
made everyone feel at home in his pres
ence. Many men, a little more fortun
ate in the world than others, leave the
impression through even a short inter
view that they are cognizant of that fact.
More than that, many such men of
wealth have a domineering manner. It
was not so with Leland Stanford. It
seems that as fortune smiled upon him
he reflected the smiles upon the less
112 irtunate. He esteemed the good will
of his fellow men of more value
t lian money. Money he gained only for
a purpose—to do good with it in advanc
ing the capabilities of the human race.
As a husband and father he lived a
lit'e above criticism. In devising plans
for the distribution of property Mrs.
Stanford was always consulted. He re
cognized her as his equal, If any honor
<• itno through an act of beneficence he
was only too glad to have her share it.
Iti memory of his only son he, with his
noble wife, founded a University des
tined to become the greatest on earth,
lie lived not for himself but for human
ity.
That he esteemed true and trustworthy
manhood in the rank and file of life
above social and political prominence is
shown in his selection of eight of the
oldest engineers of his railroad system
to bear his body to the tomb.
As expressed by the Sacramento lice,
The grandest monument to the mem
cry of the departed will not be in marble
or in bronze but in the hearts of the
common people. There he will not he
known as Lki.and Stanfokd the indomi
table railroad builder, the governor,
the United States senator, but as Leland
Stanford the man, the benefactor, the
true friend of labor and of education,
ami the champion at all times of the
lalxmng classes.
