# IN MEMORIAM.
## Hon. LELAND STANFORD, Late Governor of California and Senator of the Culled States. Died June 21, A. D. 1893. 
### 
Now bows the Golden Statelier Borrow
ing head—
The greatest, noblest of her sons is
dead!
That Master Man, whose three score
years and ten
Did more than any of the sons of
men
Whom history sings, of good, now cold
in death,
Shares, with earth's greatest, Fame's
immortal wreath.
Did more of good ? Not idle is the
phrase:
To naught but deeds belongs undying
praise.
Great deeds shine ever through the
unending days.
What did he? To his will their sum
mits bowed
The white Sierra from their veils of
cloud ;
lie pierced the mountains with un
daunted hand,
And linked the East and West with
iron band ;
Opened the path which nations now
pursue ;
Laid bare the riches of this land to
view,
And taught the farmer how its fruitful
soil
Would thrice repay the outlay of his
toil.
When stood our country in its utmost
strait
Ilis was the hand that held the Golden
State
True to the Union ! Governor as
man,
Foremost to execute, as first to
plan.
In his last years, as Senator, he
bore
On his crowned brow one wreath of
laurels more.
But Palo Alto best he loved, the
scene
Of peaceful home joys and a life
serene,
Untrammeled by all business cares, and
here
Most, too, were cherished what his boy
held dear —
The little railroad hidden by the
trees ;
The dappled grey ending his days in
ease ;
All, all lie loved were there ; and there
his heart
Was centered. Tliougl.it then did his
final part.
From his boy's grave the Grand Ideal
rose —
A temple built on the high lines of
those
Whose names past History wreathes
with flowers of gold ;
A temple built upon a plan so bold,
So broad, so universal in its scope,
As to make effort realize her hope.
So to the end : Loved, honored, and
revered,
His name, through action, to all hearts
endeared ;
Of all the praises framed by tongue or
pen
He earned the best: "He loved his
fellow men."
