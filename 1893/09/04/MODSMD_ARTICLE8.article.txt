# An Incident In the Life of Senator Stanford Hitherto Unpublished,
## 
### 
In addition to the many successful
enterprises of Senator Stanford there
%vcre some important projects which he
entertained but never could carry out.
lie frequently expressed the opinion
that man's life was too short; that
when, after years of work, a man had
acquired an amount of wsdom and ex
perience sufficient to enable him to ac
complish results, then his physical
strong h became impaired and he no
longer could do justice to his mental
powers.
Senator Stanford's great achieve
ments a r e fami'iar to all. Among the
less Jam; iar works wt '.eh he at one
time projected hut did not accomplish
was the construction of a tilroad from
Coustan'.nople i 1 • the j'ersian Gu'f.
The immense tr; flic it ou li ilie Suez
canal Ion:.; ago attracted his attention.
A t"oportion of that trade con
sists of I ih' ics too valuable to be sent
by water it' there wee a competing
land route and especially if there ex
isted a snorter laud route. This sub
ject occupied h.s serious attention dur
ing a trip which he made through
eastern Kurope in ISK4. While in
Constantinople he investigated the
legibility of the project with such
r.r.; '..tiipr. rli'tf rumors of hi< inquiries
reached the Yldez Palace. The Sul
tan at once dispatched an aide-de-camp
to Mr. Stanford asking (or rather
ordering) an interview for the next
afternoon. Mr. Stanford had made all
preparations to leave lor Athens ou the
mroamer that sailed the next morning.
His reply to the sultan was, therefore,
n reuret that owing to the early hour
of sailing, it was not in his power to
present himself at the palace in the
afternoon. But, a despotic govern
ment is not without its advantages.
"Word eamo promptly back from the
palace that the steamer would not sail
without Mr. S fan lord.
The interview accordingly took place
on (he next afternoon and lasted sev
eral hours. The question of a railroad
from Constantinople, or rather Scutari
on the opposite side of the Bosphorus,
was thoroughly and freely discussed in
tlie presence only of an interpreter and
Pangiris Bey, au able decamp. At its
close, Abdul llamid bluntly asked Mr.
Stanford if he would undertake the
construction of the road. Mr, Stan
ford answered that he could not prom
ise to undertake a work of such magni
tude without fui ther and careful con
sideration, but thai in a few days he
would communicate his answer. 'J hat
evening he sailed lor Athens. For
about a week the matter occupied his
almost exclusive attention. At the
end of that time lie finally decided that
had he been younger, or his son some
years older, lie might have accepted
the sultan's proposition, but under ex
isting conditions he would decline it.
His communication to the sultan an
nouncing this decision was an able and
carefully prepared paper containing, in
addition to his reasons for declining,
many valuable suggestions in regard to
the building of the road and the man
ner in which the necessary fuuds might
be raised lbr its construction.
Whether or not this communication
readied its destination I do not know.
Its receipt was never acknowledged
and, >111cu it Wan lU't. retuiiiod to the
writer, it may be presumed that Tur
key has no dead-letter service—unless
the entire postal service of the couutry
b ; a dead letter.
This was in ]BS-t. The Euphrates
Valley railroad i;i not yet. built
