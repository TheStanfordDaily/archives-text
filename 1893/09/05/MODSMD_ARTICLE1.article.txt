rweet rest to tlice and thine, illustrious !
head, I
Sweet rest and deep,
Where we have laid thee, after all is !
said,
In <;fani to-guarded sleep;
With that stern silence of long ages dead, j
The sphinxes vigil keep.
Not yet, strong heart, into that hush of
stone
Comes perfect peace?
Still waiting stands the third place open
thrown.
Unrest can only cease
When from the sorrow she endures
alone
One other finds release.
Sweet rest to thee and thine; in calm
content
Sleep quietly.
More than a granite tomb the monu
ment
That ever stands to thee,
The gratitude of our great continent
Thine irniiiortiility.
