# Account of Senator Stanford's Funeral.
## 
### 
Lt is estimated that iully 5,000
people attended the funeral of Senator
Stanford. These people cime from
nearly i*very walk in life. They re
j r sen'e 1 nearly every creed :i> d color.
'The common laborers who had kuown
ic "Governor,' 1 as they culled him, as
a friend and counselor, as well as many
(if the most prominent statesmen and
business men of (California, were in at
'< il l nice. The florul decorations were
profuse and very beautiful. The
funeral services were plain and simple.
In ail the arrangements no attempt.
\v ts made to display wealth or honor
It was a funeral in keeping with the
it!e of the gveut philanthropist and one
(•'i -h as the Senator would have plained
ior himself; in fact he had often
< xpressed his desire to Mrs Stanford
and Mr. Nash to the effect that the
v rem tuies attending his burial should
lie devoid of pomp and display
liet'.y and without formality did the
largo crowd come and go and for no
•other purpose than to pay their last,
tributes of respect to one who had so
often b'friended them.

Lying in the casket Senator Stanford
io .ked remarkably life-like, except for
: n unusual pallor. His leataros were
in perfect repose, bearing all the pla
cidity of peaceful slumber. His body
re ted in a biack cloth covered casket
which was placed in the center of" the
library adjoining the chamber in which
bo breathed his last. The only relief
to the somber receptacle for the dead
w is ib ! siderails or handles and the
plate which were of oxydized silver.
The litter bore the following inscrip
tion :
I,Ml,AND STANFORD.

Mr. Stanford was dressed in a black
frock suit such us it was his custom to
wear in life. The black silk knot
tucked under a turned-down collar and
the two pearl studs in tiie snowy shirt
front, so familiar to all who knew the
Senator, were also there. Upon the
bre.-ist rested a dainty cluster id' tube
roses ami maiden hair tern, laid there
by Mrs. Stanford.
Many floral tributes to the Senator's
honor were sent by friends. One of the
most notable piec-s was a triple arch of
\vb to and pink fl iwers representing
the central arch of the main l.'niversby

building. There were two other very
beautiful pieces made by Chinese
gardeners at Palo Alto, which completed
the floral group iiround the head of the
casket One was a brokej wheel o<
carnations, hollyhocks, violets, white
peas and ferns, with a trimming of
white and pink roses; the other was a
large cross of ivy leaves, smilax and j
ferns, with a trimming of white aud
pink roses.
The services were held in the quad
rangle Ou the northern front the
center arch had been boarded up and
here was erected a platform. A can
vas awning extended over the platform
and the space directly in front of it.
The pl.it.form was handsomely decor
ated with ferns, smilax and evergreens, j
relieved by thousands of St. Joseph's i
lilies. The temporary chancel was;
tianked on the left by a f'ac simile in 1
flowers of one of the first locomotives
ever purchased by and operated on the j
Central Pacific railroad —the "Gov-|
ernor Stauford," It was a tribute';
sr-nt by the employes in the general |
t fli *e of rhe company. The boiler and !
smokestack were of mauve-colored
sweet peas. The headlight was out- :
lined by yellow pansles and the bell i
aud sand dome were wholly made ol :
these flowers. The cab was of white i
peas, bordered with yellow pansies, j
while the wheels and beams were re- j
presented by evergreens, smilax and ;
maideu-h dr fern. The tender was a 1
perfect model of white sweet peas I
edged by pansies and finished inside j
with ivy loaves. On the headlight]
were the initials "L. S." and on the
sides of the cab, in heliotropes, the
name ''Governor Stauford."
On the right of the bier was the of
fering of the boys connected with the
stables —a floral horse. It was a very
excellent model of the Senator's favor-j
itc filly which he had admired so much !
ouly a few days before his death — tii|
"bay filly Mary Osborne, he had mimed j
in honor of a niece of Justice Stephen !
J. Field. The piece was a work of art, j
and when the white leather halter had
been adjusted if was very lifelike, the
bay color being very closely matched
by the sweet peas.
At the head of the funeral cortege
were Bishop Nichols, llev. Dr. Foute
aud He v. I > r Stebbins.
Or. Stebbins delivered the funeral,
address. In pait lie said:
"In every life, high or low, rich or
; poor, there is a track of light that re-
I veals the inner idea, the momentum
! and gravitation of the man. Anions
j mixed causes he obeys a final law like
j that ia the universe of worlds that
I keeps the stars from wrong. Mr.
: Stanford's powers as a man consisted in
| that combination of the common facul
ties of human nature that gives good
sense and what is called long-headcd
ue.ss, united with sincere human sym
pathies. He came to the table-land of
; life among the terrible splendors of a
new era oi the country. 1 liv star was
in the horizon. For him the earth
turned, suns rose and set, winds blew,
waters 11 nved aud the nation's grief and
weeping history opened wide the gate
i of opportunity. Opportunity!—the tile
in the afl'iirs of men which, taken at
flood, carries on to fortune. No man
| can be rich by his own siuipleindustry.
| Times, events, and circumstances must
favor and take him under their great
! protection. The line between the mt.n
and his opportunity can be drawn by no
hand but. that m which all creatures live.
'•And here we come where we touch
the very nerve and quick ot a man's
being. IJow does he behave in the

kingdom of what he calls his own'(
How docs he handle his propei ty,
which war, or famine, or a nation's
glory helped him to win ? Does he
fling about his power as the chartered
libertine of self-will, or voluntarily ab
dicate in favor of a higher law? A
truly noble being never uses power as
power, bnt as increased responsibility.
Here is the moral germ of all posses
sion, which, by little and little putting
forth its eternal strength, like a seed
'twixt blocks of granite, moves the!
foundations of the world, transforming j
the miture and power of property from
age to age.
''Mr. Stanford's reputation and influ
ence will not rest on any public office
that he ever held; neither on his
having been a central figure, amid ex
traordinary circumstances, iu founding
one of the great corporate properties of
the country; but on the use he made of
that portion of the great property that
belonged to him. That key-note
"ofTus character as it will go down to
coming generations. It would be idle,
of course, to contend that he was not
influenced by the ordinaiy motives of
men, or <1 id not pursue the ordinary
methods of busin'SS. But what effect
did the ripening process of life and
experience have on his mind in regard
to his property ? What was the final
moral effect and outcome of it all?
''The moral crisis in Mr. Stanford's
life was the death of his son; —fair boy,
on whose counterfeit in yonder hall
the youth of coming time shall look,
and learn that 'twas his translation that,
reared these walls and illumined these
skies with intellectual light. That event
o'erel'uded Mr. Stanford's heart, and
drew the sunbeams out of the day. But,
strange paradox of human experience,
darkness reveal-! And the conviction
is borne home to every thoughtful
heart that there mu.-t be light to make
so deep a shade. '1/ml darkness was
cleft by cclestial beams, opening to his
vision a wider day. The past, the pres
ent, and the future flashed on his mind,
illumined his being, and the vision of
the sacred lyrist dawned before him as
he looked down the vista of the future:
" a long nice Uiv Pp wious courts a<lorn ;
Sec future •*■»* ami ilaugtit' rs jvt unborn,
la ornwllng nuiks on > very side arise,
DcniamUng iil'e, impatient 'for the ekicfO
u Mr. Stanford conceived education as
the theme of the world—the business
of God. Education! A vague ex
pression, often, in the common mind,
but which, in its complete aud inclusive
sense, is that ' process of the suns" by
which God is leiding forth mankind
and cnchurcbing His spirit in the mind
and heart of the race It was this al
, liance with the Internal Will that f'asci
j nated his imagination aud affections.
! In conversation with him, I congratu
! iated him on the fair promise aud hap
py auspices of the young university,
lie replied: "Wo feel [he always u*>ed
the plural, thu> including that womanly
heart from whose fountains his life had
ever been refreshed] that wc have good
ground for hope. We do not feel that
we are making great sacrifices. We
feel that we are working with and for
(he Almighty Providence." For this I
praise and honor him; and in honoring
and praising him, I praise and honor
God, who 8.» manifests Himself to the
children of men. This is Mr. S;an
ford's name above all riches, and hi>
fa:no throughout, all generations.
"Hearers—-men of iron hands and iron
hearts! — gentle down your strength a
little as ye bear his body forth —'t is a
man ye bear—and lay it softly iu its
last, strong resting place.
