Death, which comes to all, dealt

youth, and doubtless lie iu whose

Weekly Palo Alto, Maytield.
His character was one of indepen
lpnt thought aud grsat determination
miugled with an almost womanly ten
derness. He was a thought producing
rather than a thought repeating
aud would have made l>is mark as au
author had lis,not made his fortune as
:i railroad m»u. —Chrouiele.
Of all the men associated in the con
struction of the Central and Southern
Pacitlc Railroad Companies the Senator
was the uiost earnest jq a desire to con
ciliate the public, and if his policy had
always prevailed there would have beeu
h better feeling. existing between the
people aud the corporations —Wood-
land Democrat.
Senator Stanford was a remarkable
nan, viewed in any light. Mpu tally he
•.vus frequently underrated because of
his innate modesty, and he never re
vived the credit of a highly cultivated,
.ixtremely active mind, which ho. pos
sessed, aud a judgment that was almost
unerring, because it was formed only
apon due reflection and thorough inves
tigation, A truly good man has passed
away. —Oakland Tribune^.
He was a gr$at :nau iu many respects
md by his owu efforts fur
vune estimated at from 820,000,000 to
*50,000,000. From young manhood to
the allotted three score years and ten
lie was remarkably keeu and shrewd
uid successfully coped-with .eouie of tbe
greatest financiers of the age.- lie was
jar-seeing and a man of independence,
;vho valued his own opinion above that
jf others. —Grass Valley Umctk
However men may regard the system
ihrough which fortunes like those of
Stanford have been accumulated, no
air man cau censure him lor availing
•nmselt of opportunities that were open
;n all, and the devotion of his vast for

arm the hostility of .tho .most virulent
hater of the .rich. A noble counselor
md generous iriend of our statu has
passed away.—-Humboldt Timea.
lie will always be Luowc as. one of
be builders of the fiu.t trans-conti
zjcntal railroad across the United States,
but that achievement will gradually
1 ise some of its significance in the rush

be claimed, however, the fact will ever
be prominent that as the distributor of
iiameuse wealth, Leland Stanford has
displayed a judgment commensurate
with the power that money gives* and
that the forces which he. has set in.
motion will operate perpetually for the
best iuter<>sts of the community in
whieli he lived.—Oakland Times.
Wealth rolleiLin upon tbq projectors
of the jjreat railroad enterprise. Stan
ford knew how to use his portion to
embody the idea that great wealth is to
a degree a.public trust, Being the in
crement earned by all the people he
proposed to re(ur,n it to .them. 11 is
bounty was always magnificent. Thou

Soul, of, deeds known before to, none
that lightened the pathway of-many a
gloomy soul and dispelled tho darkness
from many a cheerless hearth.—Sacra
mento News.
After reaching..great eminence as a.
successful railroad magnate he did not,
as is the ease, in. almost all instances,
continue solely the pursuit of wealth to
the last. Instead, before the close of
his career, he devoted his great ability
and energy almost exclusively to the. 1
upbuijdifig of an eduQational institution
whose influence for the good of human
ity will undoubtedly be felt iu all the
centuries to come. Perhaps no great
American ever built a prouder or more
enduring monument for himself than
Senator Stanford here in Santa Clara
county. —San Jose News.

and politics climbed to the very top.
The people of California do well to
mourn the death of such a man. Let
his virtues be imitated,,and, if he had
any faults, all true, people will be dis
posed to cover them with the mantle of
charity. Leland Stanford lived and
died the greatest, the most influential
California,!!.—Santa iiosa Republican.
