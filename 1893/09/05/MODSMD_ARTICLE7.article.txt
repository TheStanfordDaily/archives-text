This state is indebted to such men
as he for its building up and wonderful
advancement, in sums too vast to bo
p-iid by a passing tribute to his memory.
His example of work, well and faith
fully performed-, will ever be an inspira-i
tion co many a struggling young man
who aspires to the noble things of life.
The Leland Stanford Jr. University,
which he founded and endowed with
over §20,000,000, is one of the greatest
institutions of learning in the world,
and coming generations will accept-iwith
loving trust the keeping of the memory
of Leland * Stanford; in the highest
niches of California's • eduaational-his
tory.—Placer News-Messenger.
He accumulated considerable of this
world's gold, and distributed millions
of dollaro-in a philanthropic manner.
Many of ! the charitable acts he per
formed are unknown because they were
not accompanied by osteutatious display.
Iceland Stanford has been a public
spirited and representative ninu, v.n
enterprising and successful railroad
builder, a philanthropist and a bene
factor of humanity, a loving husband,
and a kind father. He had ,acted his
part well on the stage of life when the
curtain fell, aud his memory will be
cherished as long as history records the
deeds of noble men.—Amador ledger.
In every gigantic enterprise that
promised decided advantages to this
at-ate, Leland Stanford took a promi
nent part. A man of generous im
pulses, his purse was ever open to re
lieve the distressed,and his private and
public donations to charitable purposes
were innumerable. Hid career was one
of the moot successful ever known in
America, and in his loss California loses
one she can ill spare. But far more
lasting than any monument that may
be erected to his memory will be re
membrance of his many kind deeds and
the work he accomplished to benefit his
fellow men —Ventura Free Press.
