# "POP" BLISS IS HERE.
## Work Has Already Begun. Faith in the Cardinal Increases. 
### 
Again the football enthusiasts around
the bay have been completely surprised
and again a spirit of enthusiasm lias
been stirved up in our student body
which will tend well to bear the car
dinal on to victory. ''Pop'' Bliss, the
famous Yale half-back whom Captain
Wilson has selected from among the
greatest coachers in the country, ar
rived on the noon train to-day and
active work was begun on the field this
afternoon.
The arrival of our great coach was a
surprise to all and the enterprise shown
by the management in getting liiui here
at so early a date will do much to gain
the solid backing of all interested
The Berkeley men have again been
headed and they are making strenuous
efforts to obtain the services of Feffle
finger before October 1st. Me has re
cently started for the east, however, and
it is doubtful if they succeed in doing
so.
Captain Wilson feels greatly encour
aged by his recent success, and thinks
that if the incoming cluss do their duty,
the outlook is exceedingly bright for a
successful seasou. Mr. Bliss seems
favorably impressed with his work in
hand and will carry out a system of
training which has been the chief ele
ment of Yale's success for so many
years. Interviews with Walter Camp
and Baurie Bliss have given Mr. Bliss
a pretty thorough idea of the condition
o' football on the coast, and he will
thus be enabled to do work from the
very start. He will begin the long
siege of ten weeks training introducing
the lightest work feasible, and as effici
ency is acquired the work will be hard
ened gradually For the present the
backs will have the hardest work, but
all candidates will be drilled constantly
in kicking, passing and filling on the
bill. Gymnasium work and cross
country runs will also be ou the daily
routine of training.
Mr. Bliss was received by the stu
dents in an enthusiastic manner when
he appeared on the campus and if the
same spirit is shown in active work, the
success of the seasou is 11 ready assured
