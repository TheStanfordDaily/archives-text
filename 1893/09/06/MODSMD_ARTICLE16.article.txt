Tiierk have been many vaued reports
circulated by newspaper correspondents
in regard to the tinancial condition ol
the University. Iu as much as a num
ber of our new students are not 112 ully
aware of the exact conditio!) of our fi
nance we take pleasure in mnkiug a
plain statement of fact. By the en
dowment grant of 1885 Mr. and Mrs.
Stanford deeded to the l uiversity the
Palo Alto estate of about 8,000 acres,
the Vina estate in Tehama county of

about GO,OOO acres, and the (J rid ley
farm iu liuttc county of some 22 000
acres. These estates have hitherto
tioi; been an important factor in the
maintenance of the University, as all
bills incurred were paid from the per
sonal fund of the founders oi'the Uni
vcrsity. These estates can be nr de to
yield an income of ยง500,000 per year,
more or less, if conducted with a sole
view to financial pr li r . At Mr. Stan
ford's death an additional cash bequest
of $2,500,000 was made to the Univer
sity. This will be p-iid with the set
tlement of the estate, in the course of
a year or two. The bulk of the estate
was left, to Mrs Stanford in recogni
tion of her e ual relation with him as
wife and as one of the founders of the
University. In brief, Mr. Stanford left
to hia wife their University and the
means to e rry it on. The University
is a memorial of their lost son, the no
blest liienioiial that an) boy ever had.
Mrs. Stanford has shared all her bus
band's plans and aspirations, and when
th<j estate comes into her hands she
will do with it, all that her husband
would have done. V hat the value of
this addition to the University and its
means of work may be, no one can now
say. Meanwhile, duiing the settle
ment of the estate, the University must
depend on the iinotne from its lands
and on the help that Mrs. Stanford can
give from her personal income. The
present period is one of economy and
co-opei ation but not of discouragement.
The fullest mutual confidence exists
between Mrs Stanford and the faculty
of the University. The work of the
University will not suffer iu any te
spect, either from the financial depres
sion ol the time, or in the delay which
must take place in the adjustment of
sueh vast interests.
