A committee consisting of Messrs.
Mac Arthur, Haird Mid Elliott of tlic
Olympic Club, Penman of IJ. C., Oyer
of the San Francisco Athletic Club,
and Mayuard and Wilson of Stanford,
met in the Olympic Clul> rooms on the
lißrh ulr. to arrange a date for the an
nual coast championship field meet, and
to transact a great deal of business de
manding attention. In order that all
should have time to get into proper
condition, the date was set for October
14th. A committee was then appoiuted
by Chairman Mac Arthur consisting of
Haird, Maynard and Penman to inves
tigate the reinstatement ot all men on
the coist who have been disbarred of
their amateur standing. The commit
tee was given power to act.
After a heated discussion the order
of events was decided upon. The l'st,
of events will be the same as those of
the Amateur Athletic Union, with the
changing of the live mile run to three
miles and the three mile walk to two
miles. The tug-of-war was dropped
despite a vigorous protest made by
Denman, who even refused to compro
mise.
Alter considerable miscellaneous bus
iness was disposed of the meeting ad
journed

The games committee will be ap
pointed in a few days, and the men se
lected will begin immediately to make
arrangement for the big meet. (Jn
October 16th a meeting of all members
of the association will be held in San
Francisco for the purpose of electing
officers for the ensuing year.
In arranging so late a date for the
field day, the committee has extended
a courtesy to the Stanford men, as they
would not otherwise have been able to
take any part whatever, owing to lack
of time. Several men have siguified
their intention of entering and we will
probably have men entered in the
hundred, two-twenty, quarter, and mile
runs, and also in several of the jumps
and pole vault As this will be the
first time Stanford contests in the cham
pionship games, many men should turn
out on our poor track and do their best.
New men should be encouraged to be
gin training early, for to the freshman
class we must look for support in plac
ing a strong team in the field next
spi ing.
