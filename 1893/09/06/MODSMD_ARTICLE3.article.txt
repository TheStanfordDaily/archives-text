# The 						Law Department.

### 
In an interview yesterday Dr. Jor
dan made the following statement's in
regard to the course of law that will be
given at Stanford beginning with this
semester:
Owing to a position in Chicago that
will detain I'rof. Abbott there until
Christmas the law department will be
under the charge of Prof. Woodruff
who is an able teacher of law and well
fitted to act as a substitute for Prof
A bbott.
Prof. Woodruff is not to give up
his place as librarian, by any means,
hut will take charge of the law depart
ment till Christmas, and other arrange
ments will be made on the arrival of
I'rol. Abbott at that time. The law
library of Prof Abbott has already ar
rived here, and will probably be used
to soma extent.
As regards the manner of teaching
law at Stanford the latest methods will
be followed.
It is conceded that law is better
studied in connection with the studies
belonging to it, as history, etc , than
alone after the general course lias been
taken, and that plan will be followed
here. Although the scheme is one
that, many institutions have long con
sidered the best, yet Stanford is tho
first to put the idea to practical use.
The , professors in the department
will also be men who are specially fitted
to tench law, .and not lawyers or ex
judges who give a small part of their I
time to lecturing, without special pre
paration, in a law school. Prom this
fact Stanford law students will get a
more systematic course than i* usually
offered in the ordinary school of law.
The law students will have their first
meeting to arrange for further work on
Fr.day.
