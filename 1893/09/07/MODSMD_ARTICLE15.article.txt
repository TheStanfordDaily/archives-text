Yestkrday's piper was greatly de
layed in publication on account of the
difficulty in starting the new press. It
is perhaps more disappointment to the
editors to have a paper late than it can
be to the subscribers. As soon as
everything is in good running order, it
is our intention to have the paper out
at 5 p.m.
