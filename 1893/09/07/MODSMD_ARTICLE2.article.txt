Dr. Wood of the physical depart
ment was found busy signing cards
this morning for students in his de
partment. rJe found time, however,
to talk a while about Eneina gymnas
ium.
He will have charge of the work.
At present one student assistant has
been decided upon, C. W. Mothering
ton, '95. The new men will be exam
ined and measured as soon as possible,
for this semester's work, and the old
men remeasured later on. All records
ore kept on file for future reference.
The preliminary and advanced work
will be carried on at the same hours,
but the new and the old men will be
divided into divisions and squares so
as tu work to the best advantage.
The bu;l ling is well furnished with
modern gymnastic apparatus, is light,
airy, well ventilated and possesses
many advantages ol the best gymnasia.
It will be taxed to its utmost capac
ity tliis year by the increased number
ot' students.
As indicated in the register, one
hour per week credit will be given stu
dents tor three hours of exercise in the
gymnasium. Last year the students
were allowed to make up for time lost
through unavoidable absence. This
year hack work cannot be made up out
side of regular hours except in indi
vidual cases by special permission.
However, each student will have four
hours out of each semester at his own
disposal.
Dr Wood is deeply interested in all
forms of athletics and will be glad to
help the boys in any way possible.
The football candidates will be given
au early opportunity for physical ex
amination, and suggestions with re
ference to training 'or this or other
athletic events will be gladly given to
any of the students.
