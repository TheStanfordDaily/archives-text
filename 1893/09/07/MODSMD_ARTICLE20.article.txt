# The 						Collections in the Museum.
## 
### 
During the summer much has been
done toward getting the antiquities in
the Lclund Stanford Junior Museum
unpacked and arranged so as to be
available for the students ot' archae
ology. The Cesnola collection of Cypri
ote antiquities, procured from the Met
ropolitau Museum of New York is one
of the most extensive and one of the
best collections of classical antiquities
in this country. It consists of pottery,
glass-ware and terra cottas, with a few
bronzes. The pottery includes vases of
various shapes and sizes, from huge
w.iter-jars down to the smallest oil flasks;
and the individual pieces or groups
range in point of antiquity from the
fourth century before our era down to
the second and third century A. 1).
The collection of objects of glass shows
more of a sameness: it includes almost
exclusively perfumo bottles and drink
ing-gla<ses (tumblers). Among the
terra-cottas are some very handsome
draped figures, many portrait heads of
Roman type and children's playthings
in large number—dolls, domestic am
maid, horses, cows, etc.
The ground floor of the rear wing of
the museum is occupied by two rooms
built exactly like the two rooms on the
upper floor of the Stanford mansion in
San Francisco, into which the young
man, whose name the new museum
bears, collected when eleven and twelve
years old the beginnings of what he
already then intended should one day
be the fiurst museum in America.
The cases in one room were arranged
and the walls decorated by his own
hand. Into the room in the new mu
seum, which is an exact counterpart
of this, inch per inch, window
for window, and door for door,
the whole contents of the San
Francisco room have been transferred
exactly as they were there. Tne
second room contains the objects of in
terest which he had collected but which
it was not fated that he should arrange
in his museum at home.
In these two rooms are, among other
things, some very valuible pieces—fine
Greek vases with mythological and
genre scenes iu red figures upon them,
terra-cottas, Aegyptiau bronzes, etc.
The Chinese collection also is in the
museum but not 3et accessible to the
general public.
