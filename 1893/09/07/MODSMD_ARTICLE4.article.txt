L. N. Chase '95 gained considerable
renown this summer as a wielder of the
tennis racquet. At lledondo Beach a
private tournament was given by the
leading hotel, in the finals Mr. Chase
and his brother M A. Chase were
defeated by Carter and Leslie. In the
singles, however, M. A Chase was the
winner. About two weeks later at
Santa Monica M. A. Chase won the
open singles and L. N. Chase won the
Association singles, but was defeated in
the championship round by Alexander
of Santa Barbara. Chase Bros, held
their championship in southern Cali
fornia by defeating Carter Bros. The
score is as follows: 0-4, 0-1, 4-0, 0-3.
M A.. Chase is the second best player
in California. Much regret is to be
felt on account of Mr. Bumiller of Los
Angeles not being able to play. lie
had just returned from Chicago and
was out ol form.
