# The
						Glee Club's Trip.
## 
### 
The Stanford Glee Club made a very
successful concert trip at the close of
last year They passed through the
Sacramento valley, making their first
appearance at the capital city. They
W'. ve greeted there by a packed house
in the largest auditorium in the town.
Every number was encored. The Glee's
satire on Berkeley, written by Mr Bak
er, the leading tenor, caused smiles even
upon the laces of the Berke'.eyans. The
Sacramento papers said that St-nford
Glee Club sang a better class of music
than the Berkeley Glee, aud compli
mented them otherwise.
At Santa Rosa, Fapa and Petaluma,
also, much honor was gained. It is
evident by the warm reception they re
ceived everywhere that the adherents
of Stanford as those of Berkeley. Shir
ley Baker, especially, pleased the aud
iences with his comic songs and mimic
work. At Petaluma they were the
guests of the Tennis Club and were very
pleasantly entertained. Mrs. Cox,
mother of Harry .J. Cox, a Sigma Al
pha Epsilon of l'ulo Alto, and manager
of the Glee Club, tendered a most boun
teous banquet to the boys before the
co-cert.
Altogether, if money, vociferous
applause and rare bouquets count, the
Stanford Glee did exceedingly well.
Mr. J. J Morris of San Francisco and
real estate agent at Palo Alto, was
their instructor and deserves much
credit for the spirit he manifested in
the welfare of the Club. Certainly it
is true that the Glee bids fair to add
more renown to its alma mater.
