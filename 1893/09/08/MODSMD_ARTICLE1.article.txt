# "POP" BLISS.
## A 						Talk with Yale's Great Halfback. His Plan of Campaign for Preparing the Stanford Eleven for the Annual Battle, 
### 
Already the effect of "Pop" Bliss'
presence is felt in football circles and
is manifested in the hopeful aspect that
all active participants in the great game
are assuming. Yesterday he donned a
Stanford sweater, and his lusty voice
could be heard all over the campus
urging on the laggards and bestowing
words of coinmcndatiou when they were
deserved.
Mr. Bliss is now comforiably quar
tered at Eneina. When seen by a Palo
Alto reporter this morning, beseemed
to be well pleased with the ourlook for
football on this coast, and became very
communicative on the subject.
lie was born in the city of New York
on the Kith of July, 1870, and it was
while attending the grammar schools in
his native city that he first became an
enthusiast, on football. He witnesesd
the annual struggle? between the great
college teams and the spirit of emula
tion aroused there culminated in his
phenominal playing at Yale last year
When quite young Bliss en'ered An
dover where he played football all
through his academic course and al
ways at the same position of hall-back.
In his senior year he captained the An
dover team and proved to be a most ef
ficient general.
In the fall of 1889 it' r. Bliss entered
Yale and his Audover record secured
him immediate recognition as a player
of no mean ability. During his fresh
man year lie played half-back on his
"Varsity." From that time to the
preseut the career of our new coach as
a football player is familiar history to
every enthusiast on college sports
Bliss graduated with the class of '93
and will embark in commercial life as
his future vocation. When questioned
as to the interference of football with
regular college work at Yale, Mr. Bliss
said: »
"Taken as a whole, the football play
ers average as well as any other eleven
men picked promiscuously from among
the students, and the game certainly
need not interfere with studies. At
Mew Ilaven the faculty demand a cer
tain standard of scholarship before al
lowing a man to enter into athletics,
but if, during the season, he falls be
hind temporarily he is given an oppor
tunity to make up the deficiency lateron"
In reply to a question c.s to the
methods to be employed in training the
team here, Mr. Bliss said:
In general I shall confine the team
to systematic work on the field rather
than giving them long runs across coun
try. I shall make thot'uujhiicss my
motto, and shall insist upon a rigid
knowledge of all old tactics before at
tempting anything of a novel character.
I shall drill the backs especially in kick
ing and punting—a feature of the game
hitherto little observed on this coast,
I understand. As soon as the men get
well into the work I shall line them up
for regular play fora half hour each
day and gradually lengthen the time to
an hour and a half. As to any espec
ial line of play much will depend upon
the team itself. With seven positions
en last year's team bit vacant 1 am
looking to '97 for the greatest additions.
Because a man has never played loot
ball is no excuse for his not playing

now, for it. is to be remembered that
both I[ickok and Ueffelfinger--two phe
nomenal players in their positions—
neither of them had seen a football be
fore entering college. I wish to doubly
emphasize the importance of the frtsh
men's help in football matters."
Mr. Bliss said that Harvard had de
cidedly the best outlook for football for
the coming season, and that Yale would
be weaker than usual, lie expressed
himself as well pleased with the west,
and with the University and its envir
ons in particular and said he antici
pated a very pleasant sojourn here.
