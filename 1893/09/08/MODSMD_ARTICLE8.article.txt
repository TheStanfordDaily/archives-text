# Encina Hall.
## 
### 
Encina llall is rapidly filling up,
there being at present but three rooms
which are not either occupied or re
served. Students are arriving on
every train and there are 258 now oc
cupying rooms. Seventeen persons
who board elsewhere take their meals
in the hall, while average number of
transients is six.
In accordance with the wishes of
Senator Stanford the dormitories will,
afrer this month, be conducted on the
co-operative plan. Dr. Jordan has
appointed W. P. Chamberlain, '95,
E.I). Magee,'9s, and C K. JenneSs,
'92, to take charge of the work. The
new order of things will be an experi
ment and its success or failure will de
pend largely on the students themselves.
Each person should feel a responsibility
in the matter, and strive to accomplish 4
all that is hoped for in regard to the
new plau.
