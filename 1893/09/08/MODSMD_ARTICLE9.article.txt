# Dining Room Service.
## 
### 
The selection of Otto E. Never as
steward of both halls was most fortu
nate. He is a pleasant and affable
gentleman who has had much experi
ence and who thoroughly understands
his business, lie has been Stewart of
the Mercantile Lunch, the Pacific
Union Club, and the Lake House, and
superintendent of the German Hospital
in San Francisco; and has held several
important positions in other cities.
Mr. Never's uirn is not simply to sup
ply three meals per day, but to pre
pare three meals which sha'l be palat
able; and to this end he purchases no
thing but good provisions, which he
serves in an admirable manner. Dur
ing the first, mouth there will be more
or less confusion occasioned by getting
affairs established, but thereafter every
thing will move along smoothly.
Arthur Audreatt, formerly of the
Palace Hotel of San Francisco, is
head waiter. Under his able direction
the dining room service is excellent.
He expresses himself as well pleased
with his corps of seventeen waiters, all
but two of whom are students. They
are always obliging and are becoming
very proficieut in the art of "slinging
hash."
H. Seeger is Encina's chief cook,
while H. Schindler officiates in the
culinary department of Roble Hall.
Although tliose who first come are
usually best served, )et on the whole,
the hall is well conducted and we may
expect even better service after the
first month.
The committee, which by the way
is an excellent, one, does not wish to
stand, iu the attidudo of master of the
hall but wishes rather to be considered
as the audit of the students in bring
ing about orderly conduct. Every per
son should be lojal to the committee
and do whatever lie can for the ad
vancement of order in the hall. The
duty belongs as much to one person as
to another and none should hesitate
to assume his share of the responsibil
ity. If disorder prevails, however, a
master of the hall will be appointed by
the faculty at the students' expense.
Success to good order and the co opera
tive plan!
