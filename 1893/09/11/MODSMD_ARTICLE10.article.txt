# Rev. Thoburn's Sermon.
## 
### 
The chapel was well filled yesterday
morning for the first Sabbath service of
the year. Rev. Thoburn took for his text
the question of Pilate, "What then shall I
do with Jesus?" "In the painting of
'Christ before Pilate' from the cold severe
seat of authority occupied by the vasodilat
ing Pilate, from the loud mouthed furious
Jewish mob, thus stands forth 'the gentle
white-robed form of the beautiful Christ.
"80 among the heroes of earth this Christ
stands forth, overshadowing all Alexan
der's conquered world, Christ conquers
more men's hearts. If you know of any
one higher or better than Christ, put him
in Christ's place. It is your duty to do it.
He was not divine to Peter and John at
first; they followed him because he was
the best one they knew.
"Crowds are pressingjaround the throne
of every heart while the gentle Christ waits
outside the door for an invitation to come
in and occupy it. I do not mean* the
Christ of dogma, but the higher Christ, the
embodiment of the highest and purest
things you know. Humanity was born on
Calvary. Ilis name is a synonym for civ
ilization. for science, for liberty and for
universal brotherhood.
"Would you buy hate? Take love from
your bosom, and pay for it. Would you
buy 1 ct nti usness, as Pilate did, your pur
j ity is legal tender for the vilest thing in
] hell. In rejecting Christ —the nobles')
| thing you know —you crucify yourself, not
I him.
"In a German legend a licentious artist
■ mortgaged his soul to an evil spirit for the
I power to become the greatest painter of
I his time. lie painted wonderful pictures
| —the embodiment of his satanic spirit.
Children fled from him on the streets and
people shunned his house, filled with fear
by the unearthly pretence of the man.
When his frenzy had spent itsell on the
canvas, he painted the face of Christ and
hung it up in his room. People began to
speak to him on the street and children to
cling to his hand. His life became geutle
I and when he came to die his [evil friend
returned to claim his eoul. When he saw
the face of the dying man he fled in terror,
saying, 'I do not want the soul of Christ.' "
