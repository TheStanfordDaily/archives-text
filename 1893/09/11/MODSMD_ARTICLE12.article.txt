The first week's practice in football
is over, and much may be said both lor
and against the results. Of the old
men who have returned, all show excel
lent form and the one or two new can
didates who have had the courage to
show themselves have already become
conspicuous for their dashing play.
Through the efforts of the management
t>n excellent field has been provided, and
neither time nor purse has been spared
in procuring as our coach the very
best man obtainable.
Vet, what return has been made these
hard workersfor their time spent,and the
athletic association's money expended?
Their call for new men has been an
swered by several candidates who have
tne interests of their cobeg l : hourt
Their chancts so far are good, and it is
hoped their energy will be rewarded.
But they alone are not enough. Doz
ens of men stand around the field every
day who have the possibility in them
of gaining almost auy position 0:1 the
team, if they only had true spirit
enough to out and woik. Don't be
disappointed if the second eleven is your
allotted place for the first few days, or
even weeks. Keep at work Remem
ber that the team is never definitely
selected until shortly before any game.
Also remember that in many instances
the second eleveu has been played*
against outside teams in preference to
the Varsity. Thanksgiving the second
eleven t.jok a trip to Stockton to play?
and it is highly probablethat much more
extended trips will be made this year.
Often a promising man is placed on the
second eleven, opposite the hardest man
onthe Varsi.y line order to
develop all points available, and then
be given a position You may be the.

will do it.
The manner in which the new men

which would dishearten any captain
