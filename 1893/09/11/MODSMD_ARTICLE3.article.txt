# Christian Associations' Reception.
## 
### 
The annual reception of the Chris
tian Associations to the new students
was held in the Eneina gymnasium

Friday evening. The decorations of
roses, pinks, geraniums and bamboo
cuttings were very beautiful and did i
credit to the taste of those in charge of i
that work.
Nothing need be said to compliment
the speeches of President Jordan audi
Professors Marx aud Miller, only that
they were such as all would expect from
men so highly esteemed. Pres. Jordan
paid a tribute to both Senator and Mrs.
Stanford. In reference to her he said:
"When the history of this summer has
been written, every student will realize
that much is due to Mrs. Stanford.
With only a limited estate and a small
private income of her own, the rest of
the estate being tied up iu the C'alilor
nia courts, she has shown great energy
and force in going ahead with the work
of her husband. If the faculty and
students will only co-operate with her,
this can be made one of the most famous
years in education."
Prof. Marx said he had done the
best he could for the students and
trusted that occasions for dismissal
would be few. lie wished the students
to rise to the emergency and to shoulder
responsibility. In closiug, he said,
''The faculty to a man will help you to
further the ends for which you have
come.''
Prof. W. Miller said: "It is my lot
to introduce you to your hosts. The
Christian Assciations receive the ucw
comers with open arms and open hearts.
These associations ueed no apology.
The work that they have done is all the
recommendation they need. You have
been welcomed to the University, you
arc welcome here tonight, and you will
be welcomed to the Christian Associa
tions."
