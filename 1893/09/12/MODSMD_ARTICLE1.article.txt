# Our Annual.

### 
The editorial board of the '95 Annual
met this afternoon for the first time
this semester. The resignations of
W. P. Uhamberlin ns editor-iu-chief
and Miss 11. Stadtmuller as one of the
editors were accepted. Miss Stadt
muller will not return to the University
this year, but Mr. Chamberlin will still
be considered a member of the board,
though his other literary duties prevent
such active work as his old positiou
would have required.
L. II Smith, the business manager,
made a brief report in which he advo
cated a postponement fora time of
solicitation for advertisements, and
recommended an early decision upon
the size and general make-up of the
prospective book, lie also read a letter
from last year's manager of the Boston
"Technique," perhaps the best annual
issued in the country. The letter was
very full and complete.
The following were nominated for
editor-in-chief to fill the vacant position:
Lewis, Rice and Field; but ltice and
Field declined; and Lejvis' election was
declared unanimous. A number of
names were suggested as candidates for
the position on the board made vacant
by Miss Stadtmuller's resignation, but
no choice has yet been made
D. 11. Fry was given full superin
tendence of the artistic work on the
Annual with power to solicit co-oper
ation from all those in the University
who have ability in that line.
