### 
A mutual agreement has been made
between the S. P. Co. and tbe propri
etors of the livery stables, to the effect
that the drivers of all vehicles shall
occupy certain positions at the depot.
This is welcome news to the traveling
public.
On Admission Day a large crowd of
citizens and students gathered at tbe
public school grounds to witness tbe
Hag raising. Major Norris, secretary
of the school board, was president of
the day. The orator of the day was
the Kev. J. Thomas. His address was
full of patriotism and eloquence. The
flag was hoisted to the top of an eighty
live foot eucalyptus tree amid the
shouts of all the citizens.
