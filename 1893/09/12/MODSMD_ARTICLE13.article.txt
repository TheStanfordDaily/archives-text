TUESDAY, SEPT. 12, 1893.

There should be a meeting of the
Boat Ciub early this week.

Any changes in the address of sub
scriber or irregularities in receiving pa
pers should be reported to A. Schmidt,
carrier and mailing cleric. Mr. Schmidt
is paiustaking and accommodating, and
will have everything in good shape iu a
few days.

With our rush of other work we
must not allow ourselves to forget the
'95 Annual. Being the first of its kind
issued in the University, it will stand as
a type of the Stanford Auuual and will
be freely criticised as such by other
universities. Such being the case, it is
a matter of interest to every student
here that, if an annua' be issued, it
should be of the best. It may be that
with the co-operation of the student
body, and it can be a success only un
der those conditions. The manage
ment report good progress in their
work and an endeavor will be made to
have the book issued by Easter. Dif
ferent departments have been assigned
to committees. Any assistance rend
ered to those in charge will be gladly
received. Frye, '95, has been very
busy during the summer with artistic
work, and any work in that line will be
especially useful to the Annual. With
out good illustrations an annual docs
not fulfill its aim; it lacks one of its
priucipal and most entertaining ele
ments; therefore those students having
artistic ability would do the Annual
management a great favor by aiding in
the work.
A prize will be offered for the best
poem sent for publication and probably
one for the best short story. A specific
announcement will be made later. The
story writers of the University —and
past work shows that much talent is
possessed here in that line—should be
gin work on their articles very soon as
the time given to do the work will ne
cessarily be limited.
We would suggest the necessity for
the Annual Hoard to put their plans
and needs before the students as soon
a> possible, in order that assistance may
be intelligently given.
