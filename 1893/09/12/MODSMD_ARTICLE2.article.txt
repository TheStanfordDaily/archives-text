were 200 persons who registered at the
young men's dormitory. In this, num
ber nearly every state of the union has
a representative. Canada and Mexico
have several. Our fame has drawn the
attention of travellers from Berlin, St.
Petersburg, Lima (Pern), Honolulu,
Lucknow, India, and Melbourne
Among the persons of note who have
favored the University with a visit are
a count and couutess from Austria.
But by far the most important person
who has placed his name upon our reg
ister during the summer, and one
whose future conduct will be watched
with an eager interest by every Ameri
can citizen, is Monsieur F. A. Satolli,
thr papal legate from the Vatican, and
the highest representative of the Roman
Catholic church in America. lie has
been sent to our country to adjust the
growing differences among Catholics;
and it is to him we must look for an ex
pression of the attitude of the church
towards our public schools
