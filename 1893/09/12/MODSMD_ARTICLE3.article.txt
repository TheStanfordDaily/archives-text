# Accommodations in Mayfield.
## 
### 
Now that accommodations in the
halls arc limited, students are
to look for quarters off the University
campu*. Many of these are finding
cheap and comfortable quarters in May

field. There is still room for many
more students iu numerous private fam
ilies in Mayfield and College Terrace.
The ineonvience of being so far from
the quadrangle is offset by two rival
bus lines, which carry passengers two
and fro for five cents a trip. Many
improvements have been made in May
field during the past summer. Neat
cottages have sprung into existence by
the score. The business firms have in
creased their various stocks and now
carry a line of everything that a Uni
versity student could reasonably expect
to find cutside of San Francisco. Pro
fessors and students are accorded a un
iformly courteous treatment by the
Mayfield tradesmen—who reap their re
ward in the shape of a liberal patronage.
