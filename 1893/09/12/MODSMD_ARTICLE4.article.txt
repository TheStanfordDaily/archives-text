The enthusiasm which was so mani
fest last year, when the project of form
ing a boat club came up for consider
ation, has not died out but has been
turned toward making the football season
a success in order that the football men
may co-operate next spring when the
first intercollegiate boat race will be
rowed.

The arrangements that liave been
made for this season's work are as fol
lows: Throughout the month of Septem
ber a series of c'ass games has been ar
ranged according to the winner and
loser plan. The final game of this se
ries will be played daring the first week
in October either in Oakland or San
Frnacisco for the benefit of some eharit
able institution. This game will decide
the class championship and will most
likely be played fora trophy to be
given either by the faculty or the foot
ball management. These class games
will have brought out the most promising
men in college and from their number
the varsity team will be picked. The
campus has been arranged so that four
teams will be able to play at the same
time and it is expected that many play
ers who would not have come out other
wise will take advantage of this oppor
tunity to show what they can do. The
training will consist of live hours a week
In gymnasium exercise under Mr. Ma
gces' instruction and five hours practice
on the field in passing, kicking and fall
ing on the ball, and in practicing start
ing aud sprinting

All members of tlic athletic teams
must belong to the Athletic Association
of the university, which was organized
last year in order that the sports should
be placed under the direct control of
the students themselves The < fficers
of the association consists of a presi

dent, secretrry, treasurer, football
manager, baseball manager and a field
captain. These officers arc elected an
nually by the students to serve for one
year, and full power is given to each
manager to run his separate branch of
athletics. At the end of his term of
office each manager makes a full report
to the association of his receipts and
expenses. Before the report is accepted
it is audited by the executive committee
of the Athletic Association, which is
composed of the president, football
and baseball managers, field captain,
a member from the faculty, and one
from each of the three lower classes.
The freshman representative is elcdted
at the first meeting of the association
after the reopening of college.
Membership to the A. A. U. 0. is
open to every student in the university
on the piymeut of a subscription. The
amount of the donation is left to the lib
erality of the member, and as all ex
penses of the association are paid from
these subscriptions, it behooves every
undergraduate to dig down in his pock
ets and be as generous as possible.
When it is considered that from this
income all the expenses for keeping the
track in order, repairing of the grand
stands, and providing medals for the
victorious athletes are paid, it can be
readily seen that none too much can be
collected. Football and baseball are be
ginning to pay for themsleves, and all that
is asked for these sports is that the stud
ents encourage the teams by their pres
ence at the practice and match games.
