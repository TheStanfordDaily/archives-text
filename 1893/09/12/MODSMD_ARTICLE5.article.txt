# Elocution.
## 
### 
The faculty has decided to postpone
the offering of elocution —English 5,
as the register has it—until next
year. So, in view of the great number
of disappointed studeuts and the de
mand for instruction in this branch,
Mr. Edwin Du Hois Schurter, Cornell
'02, has decided to offer a private
course similar to the English 5 of the
register, at the nominal cost of $10 for
the entire course. It will begin the
last of this week, continue until March
and conclude with a contest fora §25
prize. Recitations will be held weekly
with but little outside work. The in
struction will combine class room and
individual work in breathing, manage
ment of the voice, reading, declama
tion, etc
Mr. Schurter gave special attention
to elocution while at Cornell and was
well rewarded for his efforts by receiv
ing the junior and senior prizes in
oratory.
