He sketched briefly the geneology of
Brother Jonathan, the conditions under
which his Puritan, Huguenot, Quaker,
Dutch, Swedish, Geruiau and Scotch-
Irish ancestors came to settle in the
forests of the new world, and their life
until the boy was born. The boy'a
turbulent babyhood and his struggle to
escape from paternal injustices followed;
the period of the "big head" which
came after the revolution, with its cor
recting experiences of travel, reading
and criticism led up to the time when
the young mau had to decide what
manner of man he would be. The in
ternal struggle l'rom which he finally
emerged a grown man, left him face to
face with the great problems which con
front him today. The lecture con
cluded with an appeal to every student
iu Stanford University to lend his
strength in perfecting the typical
American, the full-grown Brother Jon
athan in the family of Natious.
