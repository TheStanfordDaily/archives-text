WEDNESDAY, SEPT. 13, 1893.

A LIVELY interest is already mani
fested in our footb: 11 i Hairs by those
outside the college, as is evinced by
the presence on the campus yesterday
of the Lxamiiu r's staff photographer,
lie came down to photograph tho most
promising candidates find to get mater
ial for an extended write-up of the
team. When such eucouiagment .is
given the sport by strangers, we, who
are in the University, ought to be put
to shame to see so little material assist
tance rendered here at home. The
greatest evil now is the deplorable lack
of big men. Henceforth practice will
not begin until five o'clock every after
noon, atid inasmuch as this arrange
ment lus been especially provided for
the accommodation of the engineering
and laboratory students it is to be hoped
that they will show the proper appreci
ation of this by appearing in force on
the field immediately. The football
management is doing all in its power to
attract men to the game, and the men
themselves must now respond to these
encouraging efforts of the managers.
Not everyone can make the first eleven
but the coming season will offer innum
erable inducements to plavets ou the
secoud eleven. They will doubtless
play several coast teams during the
training season and will have equal
privileges with the first eleven at the
training table.
In addition to this, on the event ol
the great intercollegiate game, the en
tire second team will be given c mpli
mentary tickets and receive their ex
penses to the city and return. The
second team bear a great share of the
hard work which turns outthe winning
team, and it is no more than right that
they should be given every considera
tion. The management wishes this
year to make an especial feature of a
winning second eleven, and to bo on
that team will be second in honor only
to making the Varsity.
In consideration of all these induce
ments offered to new players there
should be a radical change in the spirit
shown, and within a week four elevens
should be running full blast.
