Any student who, during the summer,
may have seen, or who, in future, may
see "Fiji," the large cinnamon colored
St. Bernard dog so well known about
the campus last year, will confer a

members of the Phi Gamma Delta

The first, sign of class rivalry made
its appearance yesterday morning in
the shape of several large '97's painted
on the water tank, the former battle
ground of '95 and '90. Yesterday
afternoon the artists of '90 made their
raid unmolested and the tank once
more assumes its natural and artistic
(?) appearance. Lively times may be
looked for.
The Berkeley "freshies" are a brave
lot. At four o'clock the other day they
had a class-meeting and decided to rush
the sophomores in the evening. The
freshmen either forgot that the sopho
mores must have time to learn of the
rush, or else they preferred that too
many "sophs" should not come out.
As dusk drew on, bands of freshmen
gathered from all sides in their rush
clothes, organized into column of fours,
100 strong. A sophomore was visible;
after parading the streets a while and
making night hideous with their yells,
they marched to the camps, built a big
bonfire and burnt a sophomore in effigy.
