# Henry Irving in "Becket."
## 
### 
"Bucket" is essentially a "book trag
edy"; so uiuch so, that when staged it
seetns almost as much a masque as it
does a tragedy. Mr. Irving's "Becket"
is a tine and suggestive performance.
There is at times a quaintness of walk
and of delivery whicn has the effect of
arresting the admiration which is fast
carrying the spectator into enthusiasm,
and at times his acting is marred by
restlessness. These things detract from
the value of Mr. Lrving's representa
tion, but they never wholly destroy its
beauty, and iu the stronger scenes all
traces of imperfection disappear. His
"Becket" is a vivid, picturesque, and in
the main, convincing performance.
To Mr. Irving belongs the credit of
having furnished a pageant which, in
beauty and artistic value, has not been
equalled. Other managers have pre
sented set scenes of great splendor, and
they have crowded the stage with sup
eruutueries, but the peculiar character
istic of this performance is its sustained
magnificence. Some change of Tenny
son's beautiful text is involved in the
performance, but this is unavoidable.
