The State Normal School opened its
lull session last week with the largest
attendance ever noted.
The usual cxercises were held, dur
ing which Principal Ohilds announced
that the board of trustees had referred
to him and the preceptress the matter
of dicipliue after school hours, and also
the question whether he would retain
the system of monthly reports verified
by the landlady at whose house the
pupils board.

Professor Childs in opening stated
that the state of California had bean
very liberal in providing the pupils of
the Normal with such excellent means
of fitting themselves for teachers, and
that the last legislature had been even
more liberal, as it had placed the Nor
mal School diploma on an equality with
a grammar grade certificate, which en
titles its holder, after two years of
teaching, to a life diploma without
cost.
The Normal School diploma, he said,
certifies on its face that the holder
thereof is a person of good moral char
acter and physicallly and mentally cap
able of teaching, and that the course
prescribed in the catalogue has been
completed.
The diploma is signed by the princi
pal on behalf of the faculty, by the
president of the board of trustees on
their behalf, and by the governor and
state superintendent of instruction on
the part of the state, and these officials
do not propose to sign any diploma that
does not carry the truth with it.
After careful consideration he had
decided to discard the monthly reports
and to place the students upon their
honor as ladies and gentlemen, and said
that any betrayal of that confidence in
them will result in their instant dis
missal. The old system of spying will
be done away with and the same rule
that applies t) the faculty, ''Minding
your own business," will be enforced
among the pupils.
The boarding-house keepers will also
be placed on their honor as to the con
duct of the young ladies in their charge,
and any violation on their part will be
sufficient to cut them off from the list
of boarding-houses at which pupils may
stay
The same rules as to the study hours,
the time to retire at night, when they
shall be iu the house 'it night, and gov
erning their receiving of company on
Friday evenings, will be enforced. In
short, Professor Childs stated, the stu
dents will no longer stand in the atti
tude of children, but of young ladies
aud gentlemen.â€”San Jose Kecord.
