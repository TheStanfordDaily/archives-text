# Football Practice.

### 
Quite a number of new men were
out, and in addition to these Code was
at his old position of quarter. The
play had more snap in it than has been
shown at any time before this season.
There is much room for improvement,
however.
The center and backs practised faith
fully fora half hour at snapping, catch
ing, punting and drop kicking, while
the line men covered themselves with
bruises and glory by falling on the ball.
Some time was also devoted to long
passes from man to man. Although
there was not so large a number of
candidates on the field as could be
wished, yet all those who did appear
went at their work with a vim that is
very encouraging to a captain and
coach. There must, howeve r , be en
forced on the minds of all students ihe
necessity for active participation in
practice by all who are physically able,
or we shall have little cause to give
thanks next Thanksgiving day. The
men lined up as follows:
Marston R. End L Condit
S'raight R. Tackle L...C. Downing
J0hn50n....,,R. Guard L....P. Downing
Eaton Center Thomas
Rice L. Guard R.. ..Whitehouse
Andrade L. Tackle R McKay
Arnold L End R Wilson
Code Quarter Harrelson
Lewis K.. Half L
Wei den L. Half R
McGuire Full Rack
The second eleven had the ball and
made a touchdown round right end on
the second down. Afterward they had
a harder fight to gain ground and the
first eleven held them down pretty
closely. Thomas shows the most
marked improvement among the new
men. Welden, too, gives promise of
good things, bur, must learn to watch
the ball closer. Kennedy is back from
the east, and there seems to be some,
thing of the spirit of last year returning
to enthuse both players and spectators.
