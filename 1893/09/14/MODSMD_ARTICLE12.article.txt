During the latter part of last year a
no ice was posted on the bulletin board
desirirg all those who weie interested
in forming a university battalion to
sign the roll About seventy students
signed and thus pledged themselves to
help form a military company. Up to
date only four of the many signers
have kept their prouiUe and signified
their intention to Lieut. Oyster of
taking military science
There is a possibility that, unless a
sufficient number register, the military
department will be abolished, aud
Lieut. Oyster recalled Certainly we
ought to be able to support a large
military organization here if we could
only get started in the right direction.
The members of the University band
have signified their intention of forming
themselves into a military band, and
will receive credit if the battalion can
be formed
It would be a matter of considerable
satisfaction to those interested if the
signers of the list wuuld live up to
their agreement and enlist their efforts
in behalf of the University battallion.
