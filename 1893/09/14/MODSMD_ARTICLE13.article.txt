Each student in the University
should fÂ«.el interest in the general
welfare of the institution There is
scarcely any need ot' saying that never,
probably, in the history of the Univer
sity will there need of exercis
ing economy as during the year upon
which we have just entered.
In building up this great institution
the outlay has certainly been enormous,
although not necessanly extravagant.
Yet in some departments the expendi
ture has seemed great for the com
pensation given, and in this connection
may be mentioned the dormitories. By
having these buildings placed under
the management of the students them
selves the faculty have asked our
co-operation. They have placed upon
us a certain responsibility which it is
right we should share. The students
who have charge ot the halls seem to
fully realize the economic measures to
be pui>ucd, and breakage of furniture
is vandalism which will not be toler
ated. If anything is to be saved the
students will be the ones to do it, for
the most part. As Dr. Jordan said:
"A dollar saved this year is worth ten
saved last year or next," and all should
work together as much as possible to
lessen the current year's expenses.
