# MILITARY AFFAIRS.
## A 						Deplorable Lack of Interest. 
### 
Lieutenant Oyster was interviewed
yesterday regarding the formation of u
military company, and expressed his
views quite freely regarding the lack
ot interest displayed by the student
body, lie desires in every way to as
sist the students regarding the arrange
ment of hours fur drill, and will place
tliis arrangement entirely in the hands
of the students. The gymnasium has
been secured, and, if no other suitable
time can be arranged, the drill can take
place in the early part of the evening.
The band will play for all parades and
it is probable that a drum corps will
play for all drills. Each student should
take a personal interest in the organiz
ation and lend his aid in every way to
effect a permanent organization.
