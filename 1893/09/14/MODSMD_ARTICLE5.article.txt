# Seminary in Economics and Political Science.
## 
### 
The department seminary is pri
marily for graduate students, but any
advanced student in the department
may, with the consent of his professor,
take up a piece of original investigation,
the results of which he will communi
cate from time to time to the seminary,
and for which he will receive credit in
the discretion of the professors. Work
of this sort has already been undertaken
by some in the social pathology class,
and it is possible that a systematic
report on the charities of California
will be prepared on this co-operative
plan.
