# FOOTBALL.
## A 						Resume of the Week's Football Practice. Whitehouse and Thomas Show Marked Improvement. 
### 
The most encouraging feature of the
football practice for the past week is
the steady growth of the number of
candidates for the team. On Monday
only eighteen could be got together by
threatening, cajoling, or bribing, bur,
now football men are so plentiful that
the second ehven has about five or
six extra to help huck the varsity
team. Four new candidates have re
cently come out who have hitherto not
appeared, and the number is increasing
every day. The play is becoming more
energetic, faster, and less tumbling is
indulged in, but there is ample room for
improvement yet.
It. is tacitly understood that the fresh
man team will play the Belmont eleven
at the earliest possible date, and this
fact has been largely instrumental in
bringing out, recruits from the ranks of
'07.

1 ii spite of the fact that Ibotbal 1 mut
ters assume a brighter aspect now than
they did at the beginning of the week,
the progress made has been far from
what it should have been with such
material aid from coach, captain, and
good grounds The boys do not take
advantage of their instruction as they
should, but seem to regard it al as a
huge joke rather than a matter deserv
ing hard consciencinus labor.
Of the new [.layers, Thomas is mak
ing most rapid improvement, and among
the old players Whitehouse is making
rapid progress ana is fast getting down
to his old fur ni of last year.
