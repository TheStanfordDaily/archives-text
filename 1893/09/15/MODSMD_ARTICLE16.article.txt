FRIDAY, SEPT. 15, 1893.

It is to be hoped that the reading in
the chapel on Saturday evening will be
well attended. Kveryoue who has any
interest in the English department, at
least, should go. Mr. Riddle, the
reader, is not only distinguished in his
calling but is considered the best reader
of Shakispere in America. If we pat
ronize entei tainments of the highest
grade, others of the same kind will be
induced to come here.

Several of our best 100 ball players,
while practicing the other day, were
hurt by coming in contact with a bench
brought on the field by some of the
spectators The effort of the manage
ment to keep the crowd back to the
curbing seems thus far to be in vain.
Chalked lines will be laid down in a
day or two, and if the crowd docs not
then willing'y stay off'the field, it will
necessitate the extra expense of con
structing a co.tly fence around the
grounds which would, indeed, be need
less extravagance, but it will lethe
ouly course to pursue.

Since the beginning of the semester
the necessity has impressed itself
more and more upon young lady day
students who bring their luncheons to
the University, that there should be
a room to which tliey can repair at
noon and there enjoy their meal in com
fort, instead of being compelled to find
some cold, draughty recitation room,
frequently exposed to the gaze of cur
ious passers-by. Here, also, they
might sit and study, instead of seeking
amusement in promenading wearily up
and down the quadrangle awaiting the
opening of the library. As for those
overcome by fatigue or illness, how
many times have they longed fora sofa
on which to lay their aching heads!
And as fora drink of cold water, —but
that is out of the question.
It is unnecessary to t.ite that the
present dressing-room for the young
ladies is entirely inadequate to their
needs; and we are certain that, if they
could see their way clearly, the day stu
dents would gladly elub together for
the procurement, of the much desired
apartment. Cannot something be
done?
