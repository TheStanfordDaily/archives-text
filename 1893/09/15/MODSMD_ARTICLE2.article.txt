# To the Student Body.
## 
### 
Pres. .Jordan has issued the following:
Members of the student body can
very materially serve the University by
helping to check small wastes. Sumpies
of this may be :
My turning off of electric lights in
rooms when they are not absolutely
needed;
By keeping away from the Univer
sity vineyard;
By returning chairs which arc bor
rowed for any purpose to the place
whence they were taken;
By not throwing loose pape r s and
other unsightly trash about the Uni
versity, where some one must be paid
to pick them up.
Every little that can be saved to the
I Diversity fnnds in these and similar
ways may be of real value. A dollar
now counts for more than ten dollars
might, under other circumstances.
