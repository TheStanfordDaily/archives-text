# Mr. Riddle's Reading.
## 
### 
To the Editor of the Daily Palo
Alto. Sir: — I wish to relieve the
young ladies of Roble hall from any
responsibility for the engagement of
Mr. Riddle, and to assume that plea

sant responsibility myself. The ar
rangement was made in vacation; it
was necessary that the reading should
be for the benefit of some students' or
ganization; and my sluggish imagina
tion could suggest to me no worthier
object fora ''benefit" than the Roble
reading-room. In truth, I engaged
Mr. Riddle, not so much for the benefit
of any specific organization, as for the
promotion of literary education —my
own included. It seemed to me that
everyone here would be willing to spend
half a dollar (if he had it or could bor
row it) for the sake of hearing a play of j
Shakespeare well read. Mr. lliddle is
undistinguished reader, and will, I be
lieve, give us an admirable rendering
of "A Midsummer Night's Dream." j
