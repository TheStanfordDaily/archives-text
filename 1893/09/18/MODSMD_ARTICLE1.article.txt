Prof. Nathan Abbott, of the law de
partment having secured a leave of
absence, the faculty wisely entrusted
the offering of the first courses of in
struction to our librarian, Edwin llam
lin Woodruff; for upon the quality of
the groundwork largely depends the
success of this most important depart
ment. Mr. Woodruff received the de
gree of L L. I>. from the Cornell Law
School in 18SS, his graduation thesis
011 "Chancery in Massachusetts" being
a discussion for the first time of the
causes and effects of one of the most
curious anomalies in the history of the
administration of law in America. A
long abstract of the results of the in
vestigation appeared in the A r <ttion at
the time. The Law Quarter/// lievirtv
of London, Euglaud's foremost law per
iodical, granted this young American
law student the distinction of publish
ing the whole article. Mr. Woodruff
lias also written numerous articles for
Scribner'ti, the Nation, and other Amer
ican periodicals.
liefore graduating from the Cornell
Law School he had had a yreat deal ol
experienc: in library affairs. lie had
been assistant in the Astor library,
New York City, one year, aud also bad
been chi. 112 cataloguer of the Cornell
University library while pursuing his
studies there.
D.etning his work successful in
every brunch he had undertaken, the
Cornell faculty made him an instructor
in English immediately after his gradua
tion. Here also he achieved the greatest
success. He cond '.cted the freshman
ami sophomore classes so satisfactorily
the first year that, during the second,
lie was given full charge of all the rhet
orical work of the junior class
After declining the position of pro
fessor of l.uv at the Indiana Univer.-ity,
be resigned his position at Cornell to
b:oome librarian of the Fiske library,
Florence, Italy. The Cornell English
department keenly felt his loss but,
hoping for his speedy return, kept his
old position open for him. However,
President Jordan secured his valuable
services as librarian before the opening
of the St in ford University.
Even in the far west he h:is not been
forgotten, as two prominent eastern law
schools have offered him professorships
since he has been here. Fortunately
he sees the great work to be done in
building up our library and law de
partment- and his past record shows lie
is able to do it.
