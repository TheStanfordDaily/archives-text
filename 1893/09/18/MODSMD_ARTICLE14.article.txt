It is greatly to bo regretted that. class
spirit should find utterance in such
vandalism as that in which the feeling
between the two lower classes culuiin
ated on Thursday evening last. A
number of members of each class, in
their desire to exhibit their loyalty,
decorated several dwelling houses in
Palo Alto and Mayfield with red paint;
and the result is the offer of 8101) ;e
-ward for the apprehension of the
guilty parties. Students should re
member that in committing such acts
of depredation, that they are not only
doing that which will bring discredit
upon the student body, but are also
breaking the laws of California, and in
so doing are laying themselves liable
to punishment, as ordiuary law-breakers.

We are now in active training for
our aunual game with the University of
California, and are overlooking the
beneficial results to he obtained from a
series of class games.
There is nothing so conducive to true
college spirit and friendly rivalry as n
contest between classes. Kvery clas>
can furnish a team that would he a
credit to many smaller eastern colleges
An inter-class schedule would not, nec
essarily interfere with the University
team's practice; but on the other hand,
unknown talent that could be discov
ered in no other way would bo brought
out.
To see four elevens practicing every
evening would be a stimulus both to
the players themselves aud to the stu
dents io general. We must have some
thing to stir up this dormant college
spit it, and we think that it can be best
accomplished by arranging a series of
class games such as Berkeley is at
present making preparations for, and
which bids fair to be one of the most
interesting features in their athletics,
bet the managers of class athletics ar
range for names at. once.

Til e athletic management needs money !
Necessary cxpensts of the training table
and of practice games must he met if'j
the year's eleven is to be given every
possible opportunity to meet the eleven
across the bay on ordinary conditions of J
eijuility. If Stanford is to maintain!
her football supremacy alongside with j
hor intercollegiate championship in '
baseball, oratory and tennis, smne J
thiiiu More than practice games, and a i

• raining table must be provided for.
Every aspirant for the football squad
should be furnished with so complete
an equipment that personal injury to
players, so far as such precautions make
it possible, may be avoided. It will
take money to do this; but the glory to
be obtained by a great intercollegiate
victory, where 20,000 spectators will I
sound our praises if wc are victorious,
is worth more than live dollars, more
than ten dollars a year, to every loyal
student of Stanford University. Half
the proceeds of the ureaf game will be
ours whether we win or lose. The
amount in itself will be more than suf
ficient for all athletic expenses of the
year. Let every student bear this fact
in mind, and i1" he cannot afford to give
the money outright, let it be considered
a loan.
To the poor farmer who cannot now
<*et money to purchase bugs to harvest
his crop, the crop, however abundant,
will be lost.
Do what you can to aid in maintaining
the Stanford prestige. No amount of
money advanced after the game can
atone fora defeat.
