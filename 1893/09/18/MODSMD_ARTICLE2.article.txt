Had George Kiddle's entertainment
been ; dvertised more extensive y and
perhaps the admission fee reduced, a
larger audience would have enjoyed
the intellectual treat in the chapel
Saturday night. Those who were for
tunate ct.ougli to attend, heard one of

tlic finest university performances ever
given here. George Kiddle is a master
of his art, and as such was able to
bring out the tine thought of Shake
speare as few artists can do. ilis
conception and execution of the various
and contiasted parts in "Midsummer
Night's Dream" was almost faultless.

vulsed with the tine comedy acting in
the burlesque Pyramis and Thisbe, per

the conclusion of the reading, the per
former was heartily applauded.
