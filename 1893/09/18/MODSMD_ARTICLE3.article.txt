# Sunday Services.

### 
The Sunday sermon was delivered
in the chapel by Rev. G. E. Walk of
Trinity Church, San Francisco. He
chose as his subject, "A good name,"
and his sermon abounded in beautiful
thoughts and figures. He discussed
the form ition and building of character,
the great personal responsibility which
each one should feel in having com
mitted to him the building of a char
acter which is immortal and unchange
able. In conclusion he warned his
hearers against the folly of neglecting
this sacred charge, n putting off until
some future time that which should be
done now.
His manner was impressive through
out, and lie held the entire attention of
his audience.
