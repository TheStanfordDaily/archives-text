Friday's meeting showed that the
freshmen are a parliamentary class.
They did little business but seemed to
rake great interest in the meeting,
motions to adjourn being" repeatedly
i voted down. The following commit,-
1 tees were named by temporary chair
man Seybolt: on yell—Marquam, rai
nier, Walker. Wcldron and Ross; on
constitution.—Seybolt, Culver, Arnold,
Gibbs aud Jarman; on colors, Gray,
Watson and Miss Station.
A special committee of five was ap
[ pointed to arrange the class defenses
and attacks against "our friend, the
| enemy," until class organization and
familiarity with their own men can be
better effected. One man moved that
the '97 men themselves tie up those of
their class who would not come out aud
help iu a rush.
The Class of '07 met today at 1:45
!in the chemical lecture room. At 2
i o'clock the class adjourned, having
