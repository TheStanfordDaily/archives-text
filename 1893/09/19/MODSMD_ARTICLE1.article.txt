## Men From Whom We Expect Great Things. Each Day's Game Shows Increased Interest. 
### 
The extreme difficulty manifested
during the early part of last week in
getting enough men out on the campus
was a source of much annoyance to
both Mr. Bli*s and Captain Wilson.
Hut, of late more than enough men have
been making their appearance and if
more men show up, it will be necessary
to put the old football field in shape in
order that all the candidates may be
trained
Hut we must have more big men
We cannot expect to cope with Berke
ley if we cannot stop their terrific line
plays. We want quantity as well as
quality. Some of the men have been
doing very creditable and conscien
tious hard woik. Thomas is a cyclone
at center and with a few weeks more
training, will hold his own with any
center on the coast. Burnett, who
played center on Monday, greatly sur
prised his many friends by his good
work. Whitehouse and Downing are
showing up in good form, the former
making some fine tackles. Fields has
impioved considerably. Claude I.'own
ing is still the same "old reliable,"
playing hard every evening aud doing
some good blocking.
Frankeriheitner and Clemens were
hurt in a collision last week and have
not been playing of late. Franken
heitner showed up yesterday and con
tinued his good playing. Clemens was
on the field Saturday fora while, but
had to retire. Condit is upholding
his reputation as the neatest tackier on
the field.
Behind the line Code is just as cool
and uucoucerned as ever, passes the
the ball accurately and blocks excel
lently. Harrelson and Weldron are
the hdf-backs and are doing some very
good work. McGuire at. full back has
beeu punting well and on Friday
bucked the line admirably, lie played
with the second team yesterday and
did some, punting under difficulties.
The second team deserves a good
deal of praise for its work. llice,
Thompson, Arnold and Headbetter are
on the field regularly and are playing
very well Arnold and Leadbetter are
doing some good tackling. McKay
bucks the center excellently and cup
tains the second team. Lyons has been
disabled and has not yet shown what he
can do at quarter. Mackintosh is also
trying his hand at quarter. Andrade
is the most enthusiastic man on the
team. Football is his major. He cer
tainly i> developing into a good player

and every now and then makes a good
run around the end.
The player who has been noticed
more than any other one man is Lewis.
Fora uovice he is a wonder. He can
out run any other man on either team,
ITis tackling is very good, considering
the time he has been playing.
We are sale in saying that from now
on spectators will be furnished with an
interesting game every day. Let every
one turn out and encourage the boys.
They certainly deserve all we can give
them.
