It is but four weeks until the coast
championship field day will be held in
San Francisco. The few men who ex
pect to represent this University are
working faithfully on the old trotting
track, trying to get themselves in good
condition for the games. It is impos
sible for an athlete to obtain his best
form by training on a common trotting
track; and in order that these men be
given a fair show some step should be
taken to finish one hundred yards, at
least, of our incomplete track.
As soon as this much of the track is ;
completed a fall field day could be held, j
small medals given, and much would be i

done to further track athletic interests)
here. Something must be doue, and
early, too, if we expect to put anything
but a disgraceful athletic team in the
tieid next spring.
