# ATHLETICS.
## Walton's Return is a Pleasant Surprise and Everybody Is Happy. 
### 
Several New Men Appear on the Oval.
Last evening's practice was remark
able for the number of new men who
came out in uniform Substitutes
were plenty, but before the game was
over every man found a place.
The first team played a very good
game considering the fact that new men
were being substituted in the line.
Harrelson and Frankenheiuier made
some good runs. A marked improve
ment is noticeable in some of the men's
playing. There is only one criticism
to be offered; too much time is taken
up befoie the ball is passed. The
second eleven is particularly careless
r.bout this. Otherwise there is no gen
eral fault to find with the playing
Now that Walton has returned, we
may expect some good playing behind
the line.
