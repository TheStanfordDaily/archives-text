The Paily Palo Alto appears
in tlie evening. The last two issues of
the paper have been out at S;BD p.lll
This makes it possible for l lie sub
scribers at Ma)field and Palo Alto to
get their papers by 6 o'cloek.

There are many students in the Uni
varsity wlio desire the opening of the
library on Saturday evenings, and it
seems only right that the library should
be open oti that night especially. Sat
urdays the student indulges in needed
recreatiou and attends the games that
usually occupy the afternoons. He hits
no time to study except in the even
ing unless all athletic sports and games
be neglected Naturally, then, he
needs the use of the library at that
time, and an arrangement for Saturday
evening openings would accommodate
the mitjorify of the students greatly.

Tnouoil most of our attention at the
present time is devoted justly to foot
ball, we must not overlook the literary
reputation of the University. We
should be celebrated tor the superiority
of mind as well as body. We should
show the outsider that we give debate
and similar subjects their proper share
of attention. Many a man said after
last year's inter collegiate field day and
debate: ''The Stanford men have the
brains, if they can't run.'' We should
uphold our mental reputation this year,
and outrun Berkeley as well. From
the debate the quality of our college
training is estimated, for it alone of all
students' achievements, athletic con
tests excepted, is printed extensively in
the daily papers
Action should bo taken immediately
by the students. We must begin now
in order to determine who are best
qualified to represent us. We should
know the qualities of the candidates as
well as Mr. Miss knows those of our
athletes, or we may judge rashly. A
committee of throe should be appointed
at the meeting of the Associated Stu
dents tomorrow, to meet a similar com
mittee from Berkeley. They should
form a debating league, draw up a
constitution, and fix the date for the
next annual contest. This committee,
or another appointed for the purpose,
should choose a subject and make all
arrangements fora debate among the
students here, to decide who are the
best debaters. A football player can

uot tit himself for tlio groat gauie by
waiting until a few days before the con
test, and then working night and day
In preparation for the debate, as well as
for football, it is the regular, systematic,
and not-too-long-continued daily prac
ticeth.it emits in the long run. Let
Someone have an appropriate motion to
make tomorrow.
