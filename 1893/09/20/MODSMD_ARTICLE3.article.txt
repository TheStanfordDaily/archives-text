Miss N. 8. Ayres, the instructor in
llob!e gymnasium, has studied at Wei
lesley during the past summer, and at
Harvard University, and has had spec
i; 11 instruction from Miss Anna Payson
Call, author of ''The Power of Repose."
Miss Moshcr, assistant in hygiene,
will also assist in the same work iri the
gymnasium
The gymnastic work this year will
be made as interesting and profitable as
possible, and it is hoped that all the
young worn m of the institution will
avail themselves of this opportunity for
physical dovel ipuiont. The work will
be adapted to the needs of each individ
ual just as far as it can be done. The
aim is to give to the students some
thing of personal benefit without going
into exercises which are in any way dif
ficult. Class work in the gymnasium
will be adjusted as conveniently as may

be to the work the young women have
on hand, and no student can afford to
lose the gymnnstic work on account of
the pressure of other duties. Credit
will be jiiven for the work as before
published.
It is expected that the gymnasium
will be furnished with a piano, which
will add greatly to the enjoyment of the
work. The athletic Held in which the
young women showed so much interest
last year will be delayed for some time,
but it is hoped that they will take a
great deal of interest in out-door sports
and encourage "the athletic work of the
young men by daily visits to the field.
Teunis should be more popular this
year than ever before among the young
ladies. They have the best courts that
can be found. In fact, we know of no
women's college in this country where
natural facilities are so favorable as here
at Stanford. It is hoped that tennis
tournaments will be arranged later in
the year. Practice for them should be
begun at once.
