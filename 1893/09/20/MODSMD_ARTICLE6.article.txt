# Tuesday Evening Lecture.
## 
### 
Prof. Hudson was not able to give
his lecture on "Science and Poetry,"
as announced, owing to a severe cold.
Prof. Dickinson of Los Angeles, who is
visiting the University, kindly con
sented, on very short notice, to take
his place.
Prof. Dickinson gave a racy auto
biographical sketch for the purpose of
contrasting ''The Then and Now'' of
life and manners in California. He
came to California in '54 and passed
through the vicissitudes common to all
pioneers. He depicted lucidly the
looseness of life and the absence of all
intellectual â€¢stimulus of those early
days. The hardening effects of a com
munity composed wholly of men, with
out other incentive than the desire for
gold, formed the subject of several good
stories.
Prof. Dickinson is greatly impressed
with our university life and possibilities
for development. He considers that
should the present generation make as
much progress in the next forty years
as the one to which he belongs has
done in the past forty years, a mighty
work will be done in California.
