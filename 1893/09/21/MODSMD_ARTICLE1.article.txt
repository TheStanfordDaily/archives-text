# THE 						BIG SUIT SETTLED
## Their Claims. 
### 
But Little Left After the Long Litigation.
At last the big lawsuit begun last
December by the Bay City Wheelmen to
recover $150O rental for the Haight street
baseball grounds, has been settled.
The suit was begun more as a bluff than
tli it the plaintiff's had any idja of re
ceiving the sum as the outcome of the
court proceedings. The football man
agers decided to let the suit go on,
however, and await the final action of
the court, as many of the most promi
nent of the lawyers in the University
Club of San Francisco offered to devote
their services gratuitously to defend
the interests of the two universities.
The amount sued for has been in
litigation so long that now only a small
part, of it is left, to meet the many debts
which are hanging over our athletic
association. Something over $3OO has
been our allotted share, of which it was
necessary to pay out $200 immediately
in payment oo our half-completed cin
der track Those at all acquainted
with our athletic affairs know that
many other bills, somewhat smaller
than this one, to be sure, yet in the
aggregate much larger, demanded im
mediate action. As far as has been
possible they have been settled, as the
credit of our athletic organization abso
lutely demanded it
The Athletic Association still owes
considerable money, but the surplus in
the treasury is gone and no debts can
be paid until after the Thanksgiving
game, when it is hoped all differences
will be settled and we will still have
plenty of cash to spare.
Every person who can possibly spare
a dollar, should put his name on the
subscription list now being circulated,
for the amount he is able to pay. A
report is being published aud circulated
among the students to the effect that
there is nearly $700 in the treasury,
and that there is no absolute need of
the present subscription which is being
collected. This report is totally false,
and the ignorance of the originator was
probably the reason for its getting
started The management has, at pres
ent, very little money to work on and if
a successful team is to be placed in the
field, they will have to receive the solid
financial backing of everyone.
