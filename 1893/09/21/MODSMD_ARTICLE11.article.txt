The representatives of the two lead
ing literary societies of the University
t'f Wi.-eorsiri have been busily engaged
all summer preparing fora joint, debate.
We have been in session two weeks and
have hardly thought ol' such matters.
Some action should be taken in regaid
to the intercollegiate debate at once.
There is more literary material in the
University this year than ever before
We are also fortunate this ye: r to have
with us an excellent professor of elocu
tion. Considering these facts there
should be a first-class oratorical contest
this year, aswell us such representatives
chosen to go against Berkeley in the
debate that will preserve the glory won
last, year. Lot every student in the
University who enjoys literary work
come out, Saturday evening and help
to jjet things started.
