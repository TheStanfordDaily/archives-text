Ahhougb we were not fortunate
enough to have a summer school in ge
ology, much work hat- been doue during
the past vacation, both by professors
and students The most important ex
cursion was made into Shasta county

by Prof. Smith, Messrs. Cole, Kimball,
Sheehan, Stuart and Cory. They
traveled about forty miles, camping
most of the time Tn the Pitt River val
ley where they remained three weeks.
"While here they carefully studied
tlie general geology of that region and
mapped it out. After a month's out
ing, they returned greatly improved
bodily as well as mentally. While on
the trip they discovered many new
species showing a remarkable distribu
tion. What these are will appear in
the articles that Prof. Smith is prepar
ing.
Wliile this party was pursuing it
investigations, Messrs. Purdue and
Ashley were improving their spare
moments by studying tlie locality of
Stanford. Mr. Hoover was collecting
specimens in western Oregon, while
Mr. Cole was collecting the fossils
wliieh he has since coulrilm'.ed to the
University collection.
Mr. Stark's collection of and
silver ires and Mr. Hoover's collection
of nickle and cobalt arc especially in
teri sting
The Arkansas exhibit at the World's
Fair has received an accurate topo
graphical model ol that state from the
hands of Dr. Bran tier n ibis assistants
In short this summer's geological work
has established a precedent well worthy
of' imitation.
