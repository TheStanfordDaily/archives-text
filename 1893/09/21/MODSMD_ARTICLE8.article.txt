# FOOTBALL.
## The 						Men Are Getting Down to Business. 
### 
As the freshmen are to play the Sail
Mateo eleven today, Captain Wilson
thought it best yesterday to play the
first team against the '97's, and a better
game even than the day before was the
result. The spectators were kept on
the qui vi.ve, and some little applause
was given both teams.
It was evident to all that the fiesh.
men 1m vt a strong class team, especially
in the line. With a little more mater
ial behind the line the freshmen will
have a team that will most likely be the
favorite in the class games soon to be
gin The # same brilliant end runs,
which hive characterized the play of'
late, were features of the game yester
day. Frankenheimer, Whitehouse and
Downing continued their brilliant work;
and Ilarrelson and Lewis showed U}>
well. The good effects of Mr. Bliss's
magnificent coaching is becoming ap
parent to all. While Walter Camp
will always be a great favorite to Stan
ford athletes it is safe to say that the
work of his pupils will equal, if not cx
cel, that of himself.
All the men of 'I>7 were hard men to
handle; which partly accounts for the
small gains made in the line plajs.
Three times the first eleven lost the
ball on four downs, a thing which thry
have hitherto seldom done Thomas's
work at center was most excellent.
Everyone now seems tc be catching
the football craze. Such enthusiasm as
is now manifested will go a long way
towards making our annual game in
November the most exciting of the
year; certainly more so than any in our
own history.
