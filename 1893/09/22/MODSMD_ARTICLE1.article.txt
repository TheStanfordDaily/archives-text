During the interlude the main ah-j
i sorbing topic was the unexpected work j
of San Mateo, who had played a good
game and held their heavy opponents'
in good style. The Freshmen knew I
that they had to work hard to win, and
started in the second half of the game
another 14 V," but Arnold stumbled I
with the ball and was downed by
Coberg. Greenwood does better and j
gains considerable. At this stage
Porter retired from the game, his
shoulder paining him so that it was ini- J
possible for him to continue. Then i
'97 lost the ball on four downs but Jo.it,!
blocked the punt kick and fell upon ,
the ball. Again does Weldon drop the!
ball and Coberg takes it, and makes
a touch down. Griffiths kicks a goal. I
Weldon made up for his fumble by j
tearing through the lii.c for fifteen !
yards. The Freshmen, encouraged by j
his good work, force the sphere tip the!
field. Weldon, I*o Wo'ff, and Green- j
wood pleased everybody by their work
and another touch-down is scored by
Greenwood Score—San Mateo 12,
Freshmen 10. Twenty minutes to
play
Again the San Mateos used the"V" j
| and gained a ft w yards. Then San j
Ma'eo decided to drop back to keep the
ball, but the fullback was intercepted in
his intentions and Stanford got the ball.
Greenwood two yards, five yards for
iiff side playing. While Do Wolff was
gaining his four yards, Griffiths and
Arnold were having a catch-as-citch
can match on the side. It, was decided
a draw. Then Greenwood made a!
beautiful run often yards and Weldon
was deliberately carried over the line
by Fickert. DeWolfe missed a goal, j
Time, fifteen minutes.
A fake "V"was the opening, and '
Stow gathered in seven yards. Left [
i half-back added a yard to it, arid the I
1 full-back did his share by adding some J
j to that. At this stage of the game
: ... I
Stow sprained his ankle and San Mateo I
was forced to retire as there were no I
1 more substitutes. Score—Stanford 14,1
San Mateo 12.
The features of the game were, for
the Freshmen, the tackling of PcWollej
and Arnold; the work of Welden and
Greenwoid. espcially the latter,and the 1
playing of Fiekert and Thomas in the I

line. For San Mateo, all the line men
did well considering the difference in
weight between them and their oppon
ents. Porter was in his Olympic form
and played a brilliant game, being all
over the field. Stow and Crafts worked
well together. Both quarters fumbled
at critical points but did very well..
The only criticism was the great
amount of fumbling, more especially of
the Freshmen, and their lack of inter
ference. Taking everything into con
sideration, the game was a good one
and satisfactory in every respect.
The Result a Victory for '97— 14 to 12.
