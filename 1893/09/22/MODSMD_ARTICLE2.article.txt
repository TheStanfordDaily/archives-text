Tl ie Pi Beta Phi was formerly the
J. C. Sorcsis. This society was founded
at Monmouth College, 111., in 1857. It
is the oldest organization composed of
the fairer sex In many colleges in
the east this society has the right of
way. In early days this organization
met with little opposition coming from
rivalry, and during that time, when
there were none to oppose, Pi Deta Phi
grew strong both in quality and quan
tity. Since the advent of rivals Pi
Beta Phi continued in that kind of
strength only to be obtained through
rivalry
The official organ is the Pi Beta Phi
Arrow which has attained a consider
able prominence in Greek letter journ
alism. The badge is a tiny gold arrow
on which are Pi Beta Phi. Like
many other of the Greek organizations,
Pi Beta Phi has adopted a fraternity
flower.
Of late the society has developed
more of a conservative spirit than that
which characterized so many societies
when endeavoring to obtain a foothold
The society is only entering colleges of
the highest grade.
The standing of the society and the
character of the members composing the
California Alpha, foretells a life long
and prosperous for the local chapter.
Vive It L'i Beta Phi.
