It is very gratifying to note the
large number of persons who have sig
nified their wish to become members of
the military band. Twenty-six stu
dents registered their names with Lieut.
Oyster for this purpose yesterday.
Military affairs are beginning to boom
bere now, and with it is being developed
one of the most entertaining features of
c »l!e c life

The ii'i'urc ot yesterday afternoon's
Student Hody proceedings was a lack of
that commendable public spirit which
characterizes and Americanizes college
life at Vale. The prominence of the
New Haven alumni in the public and
political alfairs of the nation is largely
attributable to these dominating in
fluences in their early college life. The
Stanford Student Body should strive to
emulate those jolicics and practiccs
which have proved bem ficial and potent
iu the older institutions of the land.

Now tint a sullicieut number of re
sponsible students have taken it upon
themselves to form some kind of a ten
nis organization and boom that hea'thy
sport to the extent it deserves, the
Athletic Hoard should take some steps
soon to help them along. It. would
probably be a good idea to turn the en
tire management, of the courts, financial
and otherwise, over to this new club,
the Athletic Board retaining the right
to assume lull control at any time it
should deem such a step necessary.
This would place the much neglected
department of our college athletics on a
firm footing, and a healthy interest would
soon be developed iu the continued
tournament which is now in progress.
