# SATURDAY'S FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
## Scarcity of Men Manifest on Holidays. 
### 
Friday's game was a failure in every
respect. The requisite number of men
had not made their appearance at .'>
o'clock and it was found necessary to
a.>k for volunteers. Rich, '93, who
played left tackle on last year's team,
offered his services, and his playing was
good The second eleven was so much
weakened by the loss of its best players,
who ware used to lill up the vacancies
in the first eleven, that the gtime was a
walk-over for Capfc. Wilson. It is to
be hoped that such a falling off in can
didates will not happen again, as it
leads to discouragement.
Saturday's game marked the advent
of two new players upon the field,
Walton and \V. C. Hazzard. Walton
was our right luilf-hack last year, and
made the lirst touch-down in the U. C -
Stanford game. Hazzard played on the
'05 team last year.
The features of the game were the
brilliant, playing of Walton and the
neat tackle of Walton by Knowles.
