# Sunday's Sermon.
## 
### 
Rev Oinsmore, ol San Jo-e, presented
the subject of "Christian Manliness"
yesterday in an original manner. He
drew illustrations from every phase of
human life.
He showed how the ancient classical
idea of mankind was modified by the
presence of Christianity, transforming
the handsome, heartless specimen ol'
animal manhood into the tender sympa
thizer and gentle counsellor. He
showed jo respect for th >| ugubrious,
sad, whip-tne if-you like aspirant for
celestial favors, but. admired heartily
the man of strong mor.il courage,
who dares and despises the scorn of
ribald unbelievers. The sermon was a
strong plea for upright, courageous
manliness, delivered with sincere con
viction and earnest appeal.
