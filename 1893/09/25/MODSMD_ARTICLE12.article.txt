Kuphronia held its regular meeting
Saturday evening in room 81 of the
quadrangle. The following interesting
programme was carried out: Kssay, by
Cathcart, on the subject, 11 Has the Lit
erary Society a Place in the Modem
University?"; un inpromptu debate be
tween Messrs. Sandwick and dale; and
the regular debate on the question,â€”
"Resolved, that Governor Markham
Should Call an Extra Session ot' the
Legislature to Make an Appropriation
for the Benefit of the Midwinter Fair."
The disputants were Matthews and
Brown on the affirmative, and Ilindsill
and Bledsoe on the negative. From
the lively interest taken by the mem
bers in the general debate, it caif be in
ferred that Euphronia has a live and
enthusiastic literary spirit. Several
visitors were present, and each ex
pressed himself as heartily pleased with
the work being done. The society is
open to visitors upon the invitation of
members only, as the size of the meet
ing-room precludes the possibility of
the admission of the general public.
