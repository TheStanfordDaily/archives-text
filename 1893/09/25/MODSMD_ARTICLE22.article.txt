Varsity sweaters should not be
worn by men wh > have no claim to the
distinction which the "S" implies. We
believe that a man who lurs served on
one of the big teams is entitled to the
respect which .1 ueh a token should bring
him, It is partly the d'lty of the
Board of Athletic Directors to see that
the honorab e distinction of possessing
and wearing a var.-ity sweater should
be preserved to those alone whose ath
letic f-eivice for the University has
ma'le them worthy of the honor. Sub.
stitutes on the varsity eleven were not
and are not entitled to wear the black
sweater with the cardinal "S." All
such sweaters in the possession of men
who did not actually play on either the
first year or the second year eleven
should be called in bv the Athletic
Bard. We will not now proclaim the
names of the men who have been sail
ing under false colors on the oval, but
il a sudden change is not made, such a
publication, in justice to the really de
serving men, will be made.
