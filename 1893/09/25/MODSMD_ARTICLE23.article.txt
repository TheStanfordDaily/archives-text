Tub Class of '0(5 deserves inestimable
praise for trying to establish a worthy
custom. At the last class meeting a
motion was nearly carried to tender a
reception to the Class of' 97. Cnfort
unately it was not passed, hut after i'
has been weli considered, we hope
many will change their opinions, a>-
probably undue prejudice determined
their actions. Surely it is more worthy
of a coll man to make it pleasant for
the newcomer than to injure him in
every possible way. The par'or is a
much more agretablo place to make
new acquuit)*ances than the gravrl of
the roadbed. The hand on the throat
is a clasp in no way conducive to friend
ship.
Wo lavor healthy cl:iss rivalry but
agree with the opinion of other leading
universities in placing the rush in the
same category as hazing and other
medieval customs. We commend '0(5
for its magnanimous treatment of adver
s tries. We expect it to establish this
w irthy precedent, so that future sopho
mores and fresh mi ti will cooperate and
work hand in hand fur the general wel
fare of all the students irrespective of
class standing
