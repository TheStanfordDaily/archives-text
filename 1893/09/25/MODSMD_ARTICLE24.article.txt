# Justin McCarthy on the Home Rule Bill.
## 
### 
Justin McCarthy, tlic Irish leader,
has telegraphed the Home llulers in
America:
"The rejection of the home rule bill
by the Lords opens a new chapter in
the struggle for Irish liberty. On one
side are elected the representatives of
the people, the sympathies of the Brit
ish democracy and the unconquerable
spirit of the Irish race. On the other
side is a hereditary and irresponsible
chamber, concentrating in its ranks all
that is worst in English prejudice,
wealth, and arrogance.
"The result is not doubtful The
House of Lords has made a similar
stand against every great reform &ent
up to it by the House of Commons.
In the long run progress and peoples
will be invariably triumphant, and the
insolence of privileged classes chastised.
Hut the struggle will be :i bitter one."
