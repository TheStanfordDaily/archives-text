Last Thursday Lieutenant Oyster
met in the gymnasium ;ill students who
had registered in military science.
After taking a list of all those present,
lie delivered a short address in which
he said that the success of the organiza
tion depended entirely upon the honor
of its ineuibers. All persons who had
experience in drilling were requested
to stay a few minutes later, when Lieut
enant Oyster informed the t ftice-seek
ers that every officer would be chosen on
his merits and his knowledge of tactics.
