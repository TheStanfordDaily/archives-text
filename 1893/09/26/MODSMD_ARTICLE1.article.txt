## Far more Interest, than Usual Manifest. 
### 
The football game yesterday was by
fir the best and im.it interesting that
his been played. The work of the line
moil was excellent, and ev< n more
he said for the men behind the
line, and Walton and Code merit the
applause »iven them. No less than
live touch dowus were scored by the
first eleven and they never failed to
make the requisite gain?. When they
had the ball they kept it until they
had made a toueh-dowu
The second team were not u in it"for
a moment, although their playing was
spirited and praise-worthy They had
two new men in their r anks who played
a very go id gatne —Tracy Russell and
\Vill .McLiine. The make-up of the
r.-gulars wis changed somewhat and
the experiment was a decided success.
Thomas and Paul Downing were the
guirds; Claude Downing took his
brother's position at tackle; and Frank
enheimer was at his old position at, end.
It was by far the rtrougest, team that
has been brought on the field.
A few more such games and our
boys, who are laboiing so hard to de
feud our honor next Thanksgiving,
need have no fears of the proper amount
of encouragement and enthusiasm nec
essary to our ultimate success.
