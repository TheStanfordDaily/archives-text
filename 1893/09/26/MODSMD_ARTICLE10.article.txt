The Student Body election tomorrow
is one of t lie most important events of the
year in college polities. Every man in
the University i should have enough
public spirit to interest himself in the
contest and cast his ballot iit the polls
A similar contest in an eastern col
lege last spring developed such factional
rivalry and interest among the students
that the leading mag .zincs and news
papers tojk up the fi_ r ht, illustrated th:
unique circumstances quite extensively,
and advertised the institution Irom >ne
end of the land to the other.
Participation in tomorrow's contest is
really an obligitiou, which every stu
dent, tdd and new, owes to himself, to
his comrades, and to the general wel
fare of the institution at larj^e.

A boat club was hastily organized
last March at Stanford, and alter an
existence of less than a year lias shown
itself to he the laijzest, proportioned
farce ever enacted here A few ficts
will suffice to show why this is so.
A membership list was circulated
and was liberally patronized. Enough
money was pledged in this way to have
built a boat-house, but unfortunately
half of these subscriptions was never
collected. A boat-house, however, was
contracted for and [tut up. 1 he result
was a building worth at, loatt $100
less thin (ho contract price, and a debt
to the builders of $200 This shed-like
affair was unwisely accepted and now
stands on the shore of Lagunita with its
windows broken and otherwise injured
Money was freely offered fora shell,
and several prominent parties pledged
other good-sized sums towards further
ing of the boating scheme. Of course,
the payment of these sums depended
largely on the success of the enterprise;
and on the other hand these subscrip
tions would have put the club on a firm
financial basis, 'i he slackness of those
in charge, however, and a rightly felt
fear that all was not progressing as it
should, caused these persons to with
draw their subscriptions. Tne unbus
inesslike methods that occasioned this
withdrawal are unjustifiable,
Berkeley in the meantime has st rtud
a boat club and has a boat-house
worthy of the name. Proper exercises
were held at its opening, invitations
being extended other clubs to attend,
a marked contrast, to the fact that a few
went to Lagunita to see one or two

punt races and got dropped into the■
water from a poorly constructed float as
a reward for their pains.
Some lew signs of life are being!
shown just now. A benefit is talked of:
and will probably be given soon. It
should be said also in this connection,
that the present officers arj doing all
that is possible with the support they
have, to put the association in good
shape, and it is to be hoped that tlicy
will be successful, as an unpaid debt
against the boat club is, in a sense, a 1
• i
disgrace to the 1 Diversity. It would j
he well after the debt is paid fort lie ]
management to seriously reflect as to
whether anything can be done here with
boating. If they decide in the affirm
ative and allow the scheme a new lease
of life, let some energetic action be
taken. At any rate,pay tin (hit and
the boat-house can he utilized f»r a bath
ing house, if not for the purposes pri
marily intended.
