enthusiasm, and for n time it. seemed as

it. (Minis. No money eould be collected
from the students, and it, was only
through the most strenuous efforts of

prevented from going into bankruptcy
and becoming a disgr ce to the I'Diver
sity. When every resource had been
exhausted, the club was still $200 in
debt at the end of last year. This
should be paid immediately. With
this end in view an attractive entertain

Onrte'te. and Mandolin Club appear
upon the program. It, i.s hoped that
all will in ike it a point to attend A
plan is also on foot fora benefit, for the
boat clubs of the two universities on the
evening of the intercollegiate football
game. The proceeds of these two ben
efits will, mi a 1 probability, clear the
club of debt.
Hut the idea of a university crew
should not he dropped. This univer
sity should not stand aside and let its
rivals take ftiU possession of this field
of athetotics.
The University of California organ
ized a boat club about the same time
we did. A number of energetic men
took hold of the enterprise and pushed
it, forward. Today the U. C Hoit
Club is i i a far better condition finan
cially than our own And Herkelev is
going right ahead with her crew
They have already sent a communica
tion suggesting an eight-oared race
next spring. In the present condition
of the Ho,it Club our only answer to this
proposition must be in the negative
Hut it. has not been the policy of this
I * diversity to refuse a challenge simply
from a lack of suili ient energy to put
a team in the field It is a policy
that should not be begun now.
There is no reason why Stanford
University should not, take l he lead on
the water as well as on the athletic
field The training facilities are ample
and there is no lack of good men for
the crew. Money is the only thing
th it, is needed to make the plan a suc
cess. If all those who take an interest
in rowing would show their interest by
joining the Hoat Club rt would aid

very materially. Five hundred new
members would make the University
crew an assured thing
A committee of Berkeley oarsmen
are coming here in the near future to
ascertain the probabilities of an eight
oared race next spring. It is to be
hoped that, they will net. go home dis
appointed, and that the preliminary
steps may then be taken for the first
in'ercollegiate eight-oared race, on this
coast. (I. J Bancroft,
Pres. Stanford Hoat Club.
