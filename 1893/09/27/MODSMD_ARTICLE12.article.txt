the regular franchise, and to make the
annual election of the Student Body
officers a contest which would give a
practical experience to all who partici

accomplished it is evident that the
hours of election must be changed
Not half the vote was polled flii< ?• ftf!'

will make the elec ions exciting and the
polling hours should changed before
