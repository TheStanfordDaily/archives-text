The announcement that Professors
Warner, Howard, and Boss would dis
cuss "Hard limes'' had the effect of"
bringing out the largest audience that j
has assembled in the chapel this year.
Many were turned away.
I'rof. Warner was the first speaker.
His discussion was brief, logical,'
pointed, and not without an occasional j
dash of humor lie emphasized the t
evils of bud investment, which is
usually attributable, to an inflated cur
rency. The centralization of capital
in the hands of great, corporations, and
the consequent evils thereof, also came
in fora share of condemnation. The
remedy for the present financial and
industrial depression must be sought in
a return to conservatism, common sense,
arid sound investment
Prof Howard dwelt upon the moral
and social aspects of the question. Ilis
discourse w: s based upon a critical an
alysis of moral and social conditions
during the "bard tines" periods of!
1818, '21, 37. ' Hi, T>7, '73, 82 and
'03. lu addition to causes already re
ferred to, be mentioned extension of
credit, over competition in trade, immi
gration and needless railroads. The
speaker suggested that the government
in the near future should follow in Ger
many's footsteps and monopolize the
railroads of the land. He concluded
with a plea for sound judgment and
moral reform.
Prof lloss concluded. His rt marks
were followed with the closest atten
tion. lie confined his remarks to the
monetary and financial considera'ions
of the subject, prefacing wiih a brief
reference to the gold reserve and its
functions in United States finances.
The present condition of affairs is trace
able to a gradual decline in stocks
which finally culminated in the col
lapse of 8 Â±00,000,000 of supposed
stock values. Hanks that withstood
the shock were obliged to discontinue
loans, the merchant's gilt edged security
availed him nought, he canceled his
order at, the factory, arid the latter, in
turn, wai compelled to suspend opera
tion Every avenue of trade felt the
blockade. Individuals hoarded their
residue in a secret nook, the banks
stored theirs in the vaults; all the
while Europe was making continual
drain. As a result 000,000 men are
unemployed today in America.
In conclusion, guard investment;
study politics and commercial legisla
tion; don't try to stem the current;
swing with if. Fifty years ago the I
economic stream was a mere brook; to
day it is a wbilling Niagara.
