# STILL MORE IMPROVEMENT.
## Hard Playing and Scientific Work Characterizes Last Night's Practice. 
### 
The football practice last, night was
spirited and rough from start to finish
The men went at their work with the
same da-h which has shown itself all
through this week and their new tac
tics in the line are far superior to those
used by lust, year's team, l'aul down
ing has been transferred froru tackle to
center, and with Burnett and Thomas
as guards the line is much more solid.
The second eleven is playing an ex
ceptionally strong game, and with more
c inserted work in circling the ends
they would make things lively for the
varsity. Russell is rapidly developing
into a good tackle and handled himself
well yesterday. The best work done
by the second e even was the all round
playing of Leadbctter 11 is tackling
was exceptionally good Keunedy has
come out Ills bucking the line and
punting is very good.
