# MILITARY SCIENCE.
## Two Hundred Registered, and It Is Hoped There Will Be as Many More. Two Companies of Infantry and a Military Band. 
### 
The department of military science
lias at last been placed upon a solid
basis in this University, and it the stu
dents of the future show such a deep
enthusiasm in military matters as is
shown now, it will become one of the
most popular departments in the insti
tution. Last year, when the subject of
:i military company was first discussed,
seventy students agreed to register for
the course, but at the beginning of this
semester only four of the seventy re
ported Thus the outlook three weeks
ago was most discouraging, and it
seemed for awhile as if the department
had become a nonentity; but a live dis
cussion of the subject led to decided
action, and a committee was sent from
room to room to make a thorough can
vas of all the students, and they suc
ceeded in obtaining pledges from over
one hundred to register for and join the
company. This number, including
those who belong to the band, has since
been nearly doubled.
There will be two divisions of the
department; the infantry and a military
band The infantry will consist of two
companies, A and B, of about sixty
men each, commanded by Kurnell, '95,
and Brooks, '06, who have been chosen
captains. The lieutenants and non
commissioned officers will be selected
from the candidates for those places
who show the most proficiency in hand
ling squads. 'IMn; companies will meet
Tuesdays and Thursdays frnui to 0
p.m.
The idea of a military band as an ad
junct to the infantry first originated
with Mr Kaufman, '90, the leader of
the varsitv band last year. He has
been indefatigable in his efforts to or
gntiiz) the band and it is largely due to
him that it is a success. Lust week
Lieut. Oyster, the head of the de
partment, and Mr. Kaufman went to
the city to arrange for the instruments
and music. Mes'des the instruments
mvned by tho members, th»'y purchased
from Sherman, Clay & Co., the most
reliable music dealers on the coast,
about £700 worth more of the finest
quality obtainable. The instrumenta
tion of the baud will consist of forty
one pieces, divided as follows: eight
cornets, four French horns, four altos,
four tenon, four trombones, one bari
tone, one bassoon, two tubas, two snare
drums, one bass drum. The drum major
will be Thomas, '07, and the leader will
be Kaufman, '06. All the members have

implicit confidence in Mr. Kaufman as
leader, and judging from the experience
of last year, the band under his man
agement will be a complete success.
The first practice, which was held
Wednesday evening in the gymnasium,
was a great treat to all present. Lieu
tenant Oyster made a speech and seemed
exceedingly pleased, lie said that he
had heard the Berkeley band last year
and that our band doubly discounted
theirs. lie a'so expressed an ear
nest desire that the band should
attend the football game on Thanksgiv
ing. The practice will be held on Mon
days and Wednesdays, and the same
credit (two hours) as the military boys
will be given, thus insuring to members
of both organizations an ample reim
bursement for the time spent
The University should feel extremely
proud of such organizations in our
midst, and they reflect the greatest
credit upon their originators And
especially should everyone feel grateful
to liieut. Oyster for the undertaking
and for the personal risk he has as
sumed Interest has bet n aroused in
Berkeley in these matters, and she has
sent f 'or a professional leader and solo
corncti.-t. It is Lieut. Oyster's desire
to have a series of intercollegiate target
shoots, prize drills, and band contests,
and he will do all in bis power to see
that Stanford excels in all.
