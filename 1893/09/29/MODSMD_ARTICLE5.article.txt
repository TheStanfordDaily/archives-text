Football Practice of Yesterday.

After the usual preliminary training
the two teams lined up for the scrim
mage work in the following positions:
Wilson r. End 1 Condit
Whitehouse . . r. Tackle 1. De Wolfe
Thomas r. Guard 1. Fickert
P. Dowuiug Center Rice
Burnett 1. Guard r Orcutt
C. Downing... .1. Tackle r Patterson
Frankenheimer.. .1. End Mcintosh
Code Quarter Zion
Weldon r. Half I Russell
Harrelson 1. Half r Spaulding
Leadbetter Full McKay
The game was interesting and full of
encouraging features, but lacked the
snap that characterized the games
during the early part of the week. It
is to be hoped that Walton, Kennedy
and Field will soon be seen on the field
again, as their absence is felt consider
ably on the Varsity team. Orcutt. who
did good work at guard last year, was
out for the first time last night
Of the new players, Spaulding
showed up the best. lie bucked the
line vigorously, tackled hard, and was
into every scrimmage with a vengeance.
Weldon is not putting up so good a
game as last week, and the same may
be said of several others. The line
men of the Varsity team fail to make
the good openings in their opponents'
line which was quite a feature of the
playing during the early part of the
week.
Whitehouse did some good tackling
behind the line but several times failed
to stop the man opposite him. Code
played his usual steady game while his
own side bad the ball, but his play was
characterized by a lack of interest when
the pigskin was in possession of the op
ponents. On the whole the game was
encouraging, and it is to be hoped that
Saturday's class game will develop even
more enthusiasm than exists at present.
