Entered at the Stanford University postofllce
as second class mail matter.

The lack of enthusiasm seems to
characterize every University enter
prise. A lew do all in their power, but
accomplish little because the students
at large do not stand by them. This
is the case of the glee club. Surely
there cannot be an entire want of vocal
musical talent in tin; University. Wt
seem to find many musicians for the
band. The mandolin club needs no
more members Ihe fact is no one
deems the matter of sufficient import
ance to spend the requisite time upon
it. The glee club is not looked upon
as it is el>ewhere. Other college men
would rather sing in the glee club than
play on the varsity eleven. We do not
deem it important enough to even have
our voices tested. Instead of several
applicants for every position, we lack
enough first tenors and second basses
to fill the vacancies.
You may have an exce'lent tenor
voice. Give it a chance. Try to get
into the choral club of about thirty
members that is being organized. Ex
cellent instruction will be furnished.
From this club three voices will be
chosen for every part in the glee club,
making twelve voices in all. However,
the entire number will not be obtained
unless some of us find we can sing first
tenor or second base.
In the Christmas vacation a tour of
Southern California will he made with
the football club If you have the
voice needed, you will spend the hap
piest two weeks of your life in Decem
ber.
