# Annexation a Dead Issue.
## 
### 
Special to the Daily Palo alto. â€”
The latest news from llavv.iii is a sad
disappointment to those who have been
upholding annexation. Cleveland has
appointed Willis of Kentucky to suc
ceed Minister Blount, and Mills late
secretary to Blount, is to be consul
general. The new minister will call
fora vote of the people to decide what
form of government they desire Three
war vessels are at Honolulu now, and
lour more, tho Voiktown, Charleston,
Mohican, and Ranker, are on their way
thither. The officers of these vessels
will conduct the elections, and it is
generally conceded that annexation is
a dead issue.
