# VICTORY FOR '95.
## First Inter-Class Game This Year. Score 22-0 in Favor of the Juniors. Spectators Very Enthusiastic. Team Work, Generalship, and Signal Practice Poor. 
### 
Saturday's gam<i of football between
the Juniors and Sophomores was the
lirst of the inter-class series this year.
The defeat of the Sophomores by so
large a score proves conclusively the
superiority of the ('lass of '1)5. At 2:550
p.m. the side lines were well tilled with
an enthusiastic crowd, white plugs and
canes playing an important part. At 3
o'clock the teams appeared on the field
and wore giveu a hearty reception.
They lined up as follows:
'95, '96.
Leadbetter. . . It. End I Spalding
.1 obnson II Tackle L Cochran.
Hazard.. . R. Guard L Mcintosh, Moore
Burnett Center Whitehonse.
Orcutt...... L Guard R.... McDonnell.
Russell L. Tackle R McKay.
C. Dowuing....L. End R Bunker.
Code Quarter McLane.
P. Downing. ..R. Unit 1-. Andrade, Lunt.
Harrelson.. . L. Half R. . Frankenheiraer.
Kennedy Full. .. McGuire, Andrade.
The '95 team took the ball and
started oil with a wedge. Fumbles and
hard work, but little gains followed
until near the end of the lirst half when
Cochran hit the line between tackle
and end, making a spleudid gain of
thirteen yards. 05 scored after some
hard work, but Kennedy failed for goal.
A few minutes later time wis called
Score. .Juniors, 4; Sophomores, 0.
In the second half the game went
still more in favor ol the Juniors. C.
Downing made the requisite ten yards.
The 05 team did some quick playing,
and by bucking the line, soon forced a
touch-down. Kennedy sent the ball
flying over the cross bar, making the
score 10—0. Frankenheimcr took the
ball at the center and made a gain of
twenty yards, repeating it by another
short gain. A fumble was recovered
by Harrelson After some short gains
another of those inexcusable fumbles
< r ;iyo tlio bull to the Sophs, After uti
successful attempts at gains, the sphere
went to the other side. A criss cross
to Harrelson aided by very creditable
interference, resulted in a good gain.
Then some splendid holes in the '!•(>
line were made and good gains re
sulted Several wedge plays soon
forced the ball across the white line for
four more points and Kennedy in
creased it by a goal. Score, IG-0.
'OG's ball at the center. After some
ineffectual criss crosses and line back
ing, the ball passed to the Juniors.

Then llarrelson took the pigskin
towards the goal. Interference aided j
him to make a touch-down, ''and Ken
nedy kicked the goal."
The game was very interesting, but i
when '95 had thing* their own way the |
enthusiasm flagged. The playing was
characterized throughout by lack of
team work, generalship, and signal prac- j
tice. Every gain made was a matter of
individual play. High running and
bucking with the head high above the i
line showed that the coaching of the past
weeks has had little effect on some of
the players. The game was a good one j
iu point of interest, and brought out the !
strong qualities of several men and
showed up the weak ones of many more, i
The line work of (he Juniors was ex
ceptionally good in the second half. ■
lluzzud put up one of the best games!
at guard that has been played on the
campus this season. Barnett and (J. ;
Downing deserve particular mention
also.
