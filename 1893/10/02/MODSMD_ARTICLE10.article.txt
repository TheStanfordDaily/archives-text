From one standpoint the football
outlook, judging from last week's work
is most encouraging. The men show, d
up in larger numbers and put up better
l all last week than ever before, but
symptoms of too much confidence in
our team are already beginning to man
ifest themselves. It is true that the
Varsity has been doing good work, and
it is nothing but right that every man
should receive credit for what he does;
but there is nothing that will ruin even
the brightest chances more than the
spirit of over-confidence. We connot
jud»eour chances for victory in the big
game by simply seeing our men play.
Berkeley has many more candidates for
her varsity than have ever shown up
here, and judging from their appear
ance in the senior-sophomore class
game played on the Piedmont, grounds
last Saturday, we are forced to admit
that they presented a very formidable
front.
Their playing was characterized by a
dash and use of headwork which has
been heretofore somewhat lukin»; and
taking it all in all, our pr< speets are not
nearly as bright as many believe We
are being passed by our rivals in en
thusiastic work, and the sooner every
man who has the slightest desire to
play football gets down to desperate
work, just so soon will Stanford's star
begin to rise and never stop till Berke
ley's cohorts bite the dust.
