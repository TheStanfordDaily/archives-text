# THE 						COMET ROERDANE.
## Prof. Hussey at the Lick Observatory 
### 
W. J. Tlussey, Assistant Professor of
I Astronomy, lias won for himself con
| siderable renown by liis work on the
| new Comet Roerdane. He is a young
| man with a good record, and a bright
future before him.
I He has lately returned from the East
where he lias been in attendance at the
I Astronomical Congress held in Chicago,
j There lie exhibited his photographic
negatives of this comet. The plates
i were studied with peculiar interest bv
astronomers. Prof. Hussey is quite
modest concerning his work, but con
sented to give the following interesting
' facts about this new comet:
"Roerdane was discovered on the Bth
, of last July by an amateur astronomer
lof Salt Lake City, named Roerdane, a
j musician by profession. He used a
| small telescope of short focal distance.
Three other original discoveries were
also made, two on the same night.
This shows that it must have just ap-
I peared.
I'rof. Ilussev was on Mt. Hamilton
when the comet was discovered. He
| was doing essentially photographic
, work. He left his work of photograph
-1 ing the Milky Way and nebula?, and
| turned his attention to Roerdane and
photographed it on nine different nights
obtaining good results on seven nights,
j July 11th to July 18th. These photo
graphs show very great changes in the
appearance of the coipet on various
! dates. In fact they all showed the
tail to be "multiple." The most
j interesting one was taken on July
13th. It showed several condensations
|in the tail. One of these had streams
! running through it, giving ittheappear
i ance of a comet within the principal
! comet. These peculiarities did not ap-
I pear in the photographs of the preeed
-1 ing or following nights. They were
noticed, as far as known at present, in
only two other places, New Haven and
| Northfield, and were discovered only by
j photography. They do not appear vis
ible, even with powerful telescopes.
I Prof. Barnardo's photographs of Swift's
comet, taken in April, 1892, showed
! similar peculiarities and attracted a
! great deal of attention. These are the
j only comets photographed showing the
condensation in the tail.
During these nights that Prof Hussey
was at work Mr. Campbell was taking
spectroscopic observations of Roerdane.
The spectra showed it to consist of
i hydrogen and carbon.
Observations could not be continued
longer, as the comet passed from view.
It was between the earth and the sun,
J and very near the earth. This fact
accounts for the comet's brightness.
Prof. Hussey thinks that probably,
| when enough comets have been photo
graphed and the data compared, a con
j elusion may be reached different from
our present theory of comets.
He did not use the larger telescope, as
; may be generally supposed, but a photo
graphic telescope of six inches aperture
! and thirty-one inches focal length. The
i exposures were made of upwards of an
hour.
