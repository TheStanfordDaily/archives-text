# YESTERDAYS GAME.
## Much Impetus Given by Saturday's Game. 
### 
Monday's game started with life j
Plenty o men were on the field and at
the regular hour the game was started, j
The Varsity started in with their buck
ing tactics and soon made a touch down. '
The work of Kennedy and Weldon was |
especially fine at this stage. Of course |
the Varsity outplayed the second
eleven, but they had to work for their
three touch-downs.
The second teaiu is to be couipli- i
merited on its good hard playing, some i
of its men deserving special mention, j
Greenwood hit the line with plenty of
force. McKay did some very good |
punting and kept the hall out of dan- j
gerous territory. One of the most
noticeable features in the game was the
aggressive work of Paul Downing, es-'
pecially his style of stopping the wedge
Claude Downing was a little bit still
from Saturday's game, but his playing
was very good. "J. K." Wilson
wrenched his ankle in the first, play and
had to retire. Williams, a new man,
played right guard on the second team,
and made a good showing,
