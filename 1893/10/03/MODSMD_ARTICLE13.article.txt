It is impossible to secure a box at the

box he must waste considerable time in
waiting, owing to the crowds which
throng the postollice afier each recita

livered is merely a nominal one. Mr.
Ilarwood is eminently worthy and de
serving of patronage, lie has just re
covered from a long sickness, and hus
returned to college with the expectation
of earning his way. His offer to do so
much for so small a return should be
encouraged by the students of the Uni
versity.

We do not aspire to become the pub
lic censors of conduct, or the exponents
of good and bad form in our university
life, but when a corrective is needful it
will be preferable to the in
dividual to receive it from ''the
leaden lips of the press" rather than
from the ''living lips" of an unkind
critic.
There have bceu amongst us from
the beginning those who think eom
plaining and kicking to be a highly
creditable profession. On every pos
sible occasion they have taken oppor
tunity to express their dislike or their
contempt in terms far from agreeable
10 every one concerned. They have
nourished an ability to say cutting and
disagreeable things about the manage
ment of "V>ry part of our college life,
and imagine that those that hear them
look upon them as possessing <rreat
critical acumen. Instead of that, how
ever, they are estimated at their true
value, find soon find their level, cither
among the petty petulant people, .or
among the stupid chatterers of scrub
dom. If we are enabled to let these
kickers see themselves as their com
panions see them, and destroy the
growing tendency to petty complaining
amongst us, one step of the many
noodful ones will have been taken in
the right direction.
