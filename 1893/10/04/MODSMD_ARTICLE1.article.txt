# Rev. Reginald Haweis.
## 
### 
One of the greatest priveleges we
have enjoyed for many a long day was
the opportunity of seeing and hearing
the world famed art critic, Reginald
Haweis. Coming as a tourist to our
state, it was imperative that he should
see Stanford, and equally imperitive
that Stanford should see and hear him.
Mr. Haweis.possesses a fund of humor
and is the! owner of a most magnetic
personality. Owing to his reputation
much was expected of him, and it was
fully realized.
He is an English "broad church"
divine, and was born at Egham, Surrey,
England, April 8, 1888. He gra u
attd in 1859 at Trinity College, Cam
bridge. His literary work has been
quite extensive. Among his best
known books are, "Music and Morals,"
"Thoughts for the Time," "Current
Coin," "Arrows in the Air," and
u American Humorists " The last was
published in 1883. Mrs. Haweis,
daughter of T. M. Joy. the well-known
artist, is an authoress of recognized
merit, and very prominent in cultured
circles in England. Extended notice
of the lecture delivered this afternoon
will be published tomorrow.
