The concert which is to be given
next Friday night in the interest of the
Boat Club gives promise of being one
of the best musical entertainments ever
presented here by local talent. The
(ilec Club, under the able management
of Mr. Cox, has been making steady
advancement. It is now singing better
than ever before. The Mandolin Club
has been re-organized under Mr. Wells.
Several new men of great musical talent
are enrolled among its members. Mr.
Campbell will appear for the first time
in a cornet solo..
All the music, we understand, is sup
plied voluntarily by the students.
None of the participants receive a mon
etary consideration for their services.
We are glad to notice this unselfishness
on the part of our mu.-icians. We can
not too highly commend this spirit. It
lies in the the power of the musical
contingent to do a great deal toward
the aid of University enterprises. It
is said that the Harvard Glee Club has
turned into the general athletic treas
ury nearly as much money as the foot
ball team Our musicians have taken
a step in this line by coming to the aid
of the Boat Club. It is a good fetep.
An enterprise more in need of help
than the lÂ»oat Club could not be found
iu the University. Their efforts ought
to be crowned with success. Kveryone
should make it a point to attend the
concert.
