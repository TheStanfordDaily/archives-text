The Daily Palo Alto published
an editorial recently advocating the
fopnatiou of an inter-collegiate debating
league between this University and the
University of California. The supreme
importance of action was emphasized.
As yet nothing seems to have been
done. We must remember that ihe
lite r ary reputation of this University
depends upon our winning this debate.
The outside world judges us by the
showing we make at this time. Let us

uot ncglcct our opportunities any
longer. We must not be defeated
merely on account of lack of interest.
Why not revive the Congress? This
was once one ot the University's leading
organizations. Why arc the literary
societies so neglected ? Even the
faculty seems to feel no interest in thp
matter. The members seldom nii.ss a
football game, but under no circum
stances can they spare the time to
encourage this work by their mere
presence.
Now is the time to act or we will
lose more tliau we have gained by the
hardest labor.
