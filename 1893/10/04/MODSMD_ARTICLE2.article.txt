# Science and Poetry.

The chapel was well tilled last night
to listen to Prof. Hudson's lecture on
Science and Poetry, lie traced graph
ically the relations of Poetry to S;ience
in the light of past ideals, their relation
viewed from present Heals, and their
probable relations in the future, lie
showed how that in the intellectual de
velopment of nations, the emotions have
ever been behind the growth of thought.
There has thus been a lack if balance
between knowledge and sentiment.
This has been the cause of much dis
turban ce lleligious and emotional
ideals have yielded reluctantly to new
thoughts and definite knowledge.
lie cited Keats, the artist of t.t.e
beautiful, as the best type of poetica)
antagonism to science. He lived in
the romance of the past, an 1 had
neither support nor sympathy for the
new thought that took awty the beauty
of his cherished ideals.
The opposition that he represented
declared that Newton had taken away
all the beauty of the rainbow by reduc
ing it to prismatic colors, and that a
woman's tears no longer excited emotion
since their chemical composition was
known. The highest poetic mission is
to help us adjust our emotions to our
ever growing knowledge of the uni
verse, to face the new thought and
demand of it what may he its emotional
mission
During the last half century the
doctrine of evolution has greatly dis
turbed the emotional world. There
has been no systematized opposition
shown to ibis new thought, thou h

many minor poets have written against j
it. The change of the attitude of"
poetry to science is best illustrated in
A. H. Claugh and Matthew Arnold.
Their spirit is "not to think what you
are thinking about tilings, but to look
straight at them and let them effect
you." Yet they often give expression
to "the yearnings that lind no rest,"
as though a doubt lay deep in their
souls Then poetry might be summed
up as enib idying protest, simple doubt,
and a glimpse of coming things.
Tennyson, aside from the melody of
his verse and other excellencies that
make him a poet, will in the future be
considered a poet of the new thought
lie caught the passionate expression of
our modern science. Browning, Emer
son, Whitman, and Buchanan have all
given an impulse to there harmoniza
tion of mind and soul.
The poet of (he future will be the
emotional interpreter of the intellectual
and spiritual thought of the age. There
is no real quarrel between poetry and
science. Fresh revelations of science
cease by and by to antagonize the feel
iugs, but to furnish a larger and
stronger basis for them.
Prof. Hudson read many beautiful
selections to illustrate his thought, mak
ing the cveuijg a pleasant and profit
able one for all.
