"Doe" Hall made his appearance on
the field last night and played right
guard on the second eleven. With
Williams as the other guard, McKay's
men were very strong in the center.
Some of the men showed a lack of
spirit and as a whole the game was full
of fumbles and bad playing. The only
thing to redeem the bad playing was
the exceptional amount of punting that
was done on both sides. Kennedy and
Ilarrelson took turns in catching the
ball and amusing the spectators by their
artful dodging.
The second team succeeded two or
three times in breaking through and
spoiling Kennedy's punting. Spal
ding played in .J. F. Wilson's place and
held his end up in first-class style.
We would like to see the team play
quicker and without so much wrang
ling which has characterized their play
ing, of late. Let them continue their
good playing of the early part of last
week which was so interesting to the!
spectators and players themselves.
