# Rev. Haweis' Address
## 
### 
The address of Rev. Reginald Ilawei B
\esterday was vvize, witty and eloquent.
He kept his audience bubbling over for
an hour and a half. The passage in
which he described the effect of a sud
den shower on a great crowd at the
World's Fair was most vivid His
closing advice to students on reading
was timely and very valuable, especially
as • it came from one who is such an
able critic and judge of books.
lie said that lie had visited Harvard,
Yale, Cornell, Vassar, Berkeley, and
other of our leading universities, but
nowhere had he found anything to ox
cite his admiration as did the romance
of architecture he' found here. The
spirit of*. Americans to invest their
money in such gre it institutions was
most commend ible.
K ;v. Ilaweis is an almirer of Amer
ican institutions, with the possible ex
ception of our "aboriginal newspaper
reporter," and for him he had nothing
but "kindness". It was rather amus
ing that while he was congratulating
himself on there being no reporters
present, live or six could be seen
through tne audience busily plying
their pencils.
Rev. Hawois' special mission to
America was as a delegate to the Con
gress of Religions at the World's Fair.
He had vi-ited all the great exhibitions
of the world since ISI with the ex
ception of the Centennial at Philadel
phia; but the White City at Chicago
surpassed them all in the variety, in
unity of architectural structure. The
three thousand delegates from all parts
of the world, in all sort* of dress, made
quite a mixture at the Congress of iie
ligiotis This was a most remarkable
assembly and gave utterance to the

best and broadest religious thought of,
the world. The spirit of a universal 1
religion permeated the parliament.'
The great religious problem today seems J
to be to separate Cbrist from Christian-1
ity. In speaking of intellectual growth
he cited Lord Brougham's words: "To
know) something about everything and
everything about something." "The,
mission of knowledge," as Emerson
says, "is re creative." Use the know- i
ledge you have. Give it a spontan
eous arrangement in your mind, and
you will feel the richer for having col J
lected it. Many methods seem dull at
first, but they teach you to attend. The
class room is the gymnasium of the i
mind. In it you can learn concentra-j
tion and to fix attention. Ily and by
you understand what was duW and dif
ficult before.
He urged students to read omnivor- j
ously. Fiction is the peculiar vehicle
in which some of the finest minds write
out their fir.ost thoughts. Novels be- i
lonir to heaven; they belong to hell;'
and to every department of morals and
culture of society between these two
extreme p'tles. ltead Elliot, Thack
eray, Lytton, Scott, Dickens. Keep a
solid book going always with the light |
book. The mind cannot live on sweet
meats. Keep up a balance. Read
John Stuart Mill's Essay on Liberty; I
Leckey's History of European Civiliza-j
tion; Drapier's Conflict of Religion and
Science. !
He pud a grand tiibute to our pio-1
neers of American literature—lrving,'
the founder of our literature, Emerson,
Bryant, lloltnes, Whitticr, Longfellow
—those who centered around Boston, i
the Mecca of new world letters. We
are now in the golden age of American
literature.
He closed with expressing his faith
in the corning day when mind will rule,
when the parliament of man and the
federation of the world will be realities.
