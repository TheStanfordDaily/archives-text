Good interference and <juick playing'
were the order of the day at yesterday's
practice. The teams were slow in
lining up, but they went, to work with 1
a vim and dash strongly in contrast to 1
their rectnt style of play.
The freshman team lb ed up against
the varsity, and though they did not
succeed in scoring, they made tilings
very interesting for their stronger ad
versaries. The backs of the freshman
team have as yet to learn how to block
off for one another, but that can come
only by practice. Several instances of
that splendid wheeling-into-line inter
ference were noticed. This is a part of
the game which is always being
preached by the coach, but hardly ever
practiced by the teams.
The freshman center is to be praised
for the way they stood off the varsity
center. Several times good gains were
made by the freshman backs directly
through the heavy part of the varsity
line. Harrelson and Kennedy made
several long runs aided by good team
interference.
