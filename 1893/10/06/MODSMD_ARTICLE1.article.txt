# CONCERT TONIGHT.
## An Excellent Program Will be Rendered. 
### 
The concert for the benefit of the
Bout Club at 7:30 this evening. Only
a few seats have been reserved. Come
early to avoid the rush. The mana
gers have made a special effort to make
this an attractive entertainment. It is
hoped that the proceeds of tonight's
concert will liquidate a large part of
the del t of the club.
