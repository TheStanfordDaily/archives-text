Among the uew students, espec
ially those from other colleges, nothing
has caused so uiuch comment as the
lack of literary spirit in society work,
and the apparent disparagment of lit
erary merit generally. The circum
stance appears all the more remarkable
in view ol the scores of English majors
enrolled, and the excellence and scope
of that department in the University
course.
Progressive institutions are breaking
away from rusty college traditions;
very goodâ€”but kinship with the liter
ary society can never be severed with
profit. It affords the lirst opportunity
for practically applying the principles
of the class rooms, calls into play the
faculties we most desire trained, and
drills in parliamentary ruling. Noth
ing more readily marks the cultured
man than the power of pure and lucid
expression of thought.
Many a famous man's success is at
tributable to his early training in the
"arena of debate." Lowell's literary
career is traced back to his achieve
ments in Alpha Delta l'hi; Webster
exercised his youthful powers at Dart
mouth; and Blaine's oratory tirst dis
played itself at Washington and Jeffer
son College.
Join a society; join at once. Don't
let other matters of less importance
usurp this privilege. An eastern pro
fessor said : "The importance of literary
society work is greater than that of any
one study. If you haven't time for
both, drop the study." In the coming
years of activity the public hall will
offer more profit and emolument than
the athletic field can boast.
