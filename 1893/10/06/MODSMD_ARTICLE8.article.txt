Yesterday's game was another good
one, enjoyed by the spectators but not
by Mr. Kliss, who criticised the Varsity
team severely for their eagerness to
make individual plays. Once he stop
ped the game and gave them a talk
which they arc not very apt to forget.
The crowd sympathized with hiui and
applauded his action.
The second eleven made a better
showing last night than they have ever
done before. In the opening play Mc-
Uuire gained forty yards. Leadbetter,
who played end on the second team,
tackled so well that very few gains were
made around the right end. Spal
ding was put at right half on the first
eleven and made a good showing.
Arnold played ri<rh t end and did very
well,
