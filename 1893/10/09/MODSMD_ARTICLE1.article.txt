# '95 AGAIN VICTORIOUS
## A 						Farcical Exhibition of the Great Collegiate Game, Poor Team work the Cause of the Freshman Defeat. Score 20-0. 
### 
In Inst Friday's game we had another
display of how thoroughly poor a game
of football can be made. No other
word but "rank" can fitly express the
character of play indulged in. The
entire game was uninteresting and full
of blunders, fumbles, and high tackles
from start to finish. It was finally de
cided in favor of tlie Juniors, not be
cause of the excellence of their own
playing, but rather because the Fresh
men put up a game several degrees
poorer than their opponents.
At. the (irst, kick-off Claude Downing
of '95 got the hall and made a twenty
yard run, but was finally brought down
by an excellent low tackle by Arnold
Arnold, however, got the worst of the
encounter by having the breath knocked
out of him and this seemed to intimi
date both teams, for not another low
tackle was made during the game.
Everywhere there was a deplorable
lack of team work, a constant succession
of inexcusable fumbles, absolute igno
rance of all signals, no interference
whatever, and, in general, about the
poorest all round playing ever seen on
the campus. The line work was no ex
ception to the general rule of poor play
ing, and not a single hole was made for
a back to go through with the ball.
The line breaking was something novel
in its way. When the back received
the ball he would place it gently under
one arm, walk leisurely towards the line
and then wait for someone to shove him
through. iN'ot once did a man put his
head down, double up like a jack-knife,
and buck the line as if he meant busi
ness.
The playing was all too slow; there
was altogether too miK-h talking auiong
the players, and no show of enthusiasm
Every time a signal w is given it, had to
be explained to someone who did not
understand it, and thus the game was
delayed aud all ardor dampened. The
line-up was as follows:
'95, '96.
R >pendale. ... 11. End L Jost
Johnson It Tackle L Straight,
Orcutt R Guard Ij Fickert,
Harnett Center Thomas
lion an L. Guard R Rice
