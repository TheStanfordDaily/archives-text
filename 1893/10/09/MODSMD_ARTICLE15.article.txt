The most triviil facts have often
great influence in the choice of a life's
profession. This may account in part
for the repeated changes in "majors."
The first year a student may decide to
be an engineer, the second to change to
the ministry, and the third he may
take up the law. The fact that a man
always was a tinkerer and that nothing
gave him more pleasure than to clean
the stables or to paint the garden fence,
has been given by a student as a reason
for the choice of mechanical engineer
ing as the work of a lifetime Mining
engineering has been chosen because
"Ma Wiiut.3 me to do something clean
and nice."
When such twaddle as this is epoch -
makiug in a man's life it is no wonder |
that we have culture seekers who would
make good cowboys, and embryonic
lawyers who would make better laborers.
For the care of these professional
diletanti, and to prevent too much
time being wasted by misapplied appli
cation, we would recommend the estab
lishment of a committee which would
investigate the idiosyncrasirs of the va
cillating ones and choose a profession
for them.
