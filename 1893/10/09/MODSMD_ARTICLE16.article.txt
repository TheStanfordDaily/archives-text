In view of the occurrences of the
past, word to the new students —and a
gentle reminder to the old ones —in re
gard to library rules will not be amiss.
There is a dispositton 011 the part of
some to take books frotn the library
without depositing a slip, and to keep
them a day or even longer. Hooks to
circulate among members of the faculty
only Persons persisting in these an
noyances and infractions, if caught, will
be severely dealt with.
Another thing, very disagreeable to
the library assistants is for students to
help themselves to books l)ing on the

counter. The assistants arc paid to
wait on the students and it will save
much time and endless contusion it
everyone wishing a book will let the
person in charge obtain it for him.
Furthermore, new students must re
member that access to the alcoves with
out a permit is accorded only to upper
classmen. Those who do have access
are expected to return books to their
proper places and to deposit a slip for
everyone taken into the general read
ing room. These rules are simple and
not very exacting. It should be the
duty of everyone to see that none of
the privileges are abused, or any of the
rules hold in a momentary abeyance.
