# Boat Club Benefit.
## 
### 
The Boat Club benefit given in the
chapel Friday evening by the Mandolin
and Glee Clubs and the Quartet was
excel ent beyond expectation, The
performancesjj of the Glee Club were
particularly commendable, considering

that it was the initial appearance of the
club this season. The work of the
Mandolin Club was scarcely less com
mendable A. little more practice will
bring their work up to the required
standard. The Quartet —Messrs. Ken
nedy, and Stratton —
rendered two selections. The execu
tion was almost faultless. The soloists,
G. A. Campbell, cornet; Miss Lyle,
flute; A. G. Kaufman, trombone; and
M. II Kennedy, vocal, sustained their
former reputations, and were heartily
applauded.
