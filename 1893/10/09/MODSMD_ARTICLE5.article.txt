# Phi Delta Theta German.
## 
### 
The most delightful social event
which has occurred at Stanford this
seasou was the German given last Fri
day evening at Luuro Hall by the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity. The house was
artistically and profusely decorated with
palms and flowers, and the favors were
both neat and pretty. Substantial re
freshments wnre partaken of during
the evening. Hlum of San Francisco

furnished the music for the dancing,
which was participated in by sixteen
couples.
The German was led by Mr. W. S.
Smythe, Jr., and INliss Winifred Cald
well, who introduced many pretty fig
ures, and to them a large part of the
credit for the success of the affair is
due
