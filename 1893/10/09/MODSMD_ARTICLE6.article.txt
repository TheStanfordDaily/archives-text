# Yesterday's Sermon.
## 
### 
Rev. George B Hatch delivered
the sermon in the chapel yester
day. He chose as his text Christ's
words to the woman at tfie well,
"Hut the time couieth and now is
wheu the true worshippers shall wor
ship the Father in spirit and in truth "
His discourse was a thoughtful one
He spoke of the slight importance of
rites and formalities in worship, and of
the great importance of worshipping in
spirit and in truth. The spirit of the
sermon was eminently that of tolerance.
