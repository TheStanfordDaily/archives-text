W. G. Eliot, editor of the University
Ma gazine, spent this morning on the
campus. Mr. Eliot has come to the
coast for the purpose of writing up the
two universities. He is preparing an
illustrated article on the U. of C., and
will at various times write sketches on
Stanford. He considers that no uni
versity in the United States is as well
advertised as Stanford, and nowhere
can there be found college buildings or
environments equal to ours, Oxford not
excepted.
He showed great interest in athletics,
and inquired about our nines and elev
ens, and also concerning our boating in
terests. He considers the rows of pro
fessors' houses the only thing which
mars the beauty of our campus. Mr.
Eliot is a member of the Zeta Psi fra
ternity, and a graduate of Columbia
College.
