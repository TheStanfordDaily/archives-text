# THE 						ATHLETIC DIRECTORS
## The 						Glee Club Taken in Hand by the Athletic Board. The 						New Tennis Club's Petition Granted. 
### 
The Board of Athletic Directors met
in the Eneiua Hall reception room last
evening for the purpose of disposing ot
special business demanding immediate
attention. The first work done was to
fill the vacancy in the board caused by
the election of R. E. Mayuard to the
football management. C. A. Fernald
was chosen to fill the position, and will
probably be made chairman ot the com
mittee on track athletics.
A communication was read from the
advisory committee favoring the peti
tion of the new tennis club in regard to
the use of the University tennis courts.
After considerable discussion the board
granted the club the exclusive right to
two of the four courts, and equal rights
with non club members in the use of
the remaining two. The club is to
supply new nets for all four courts when
needed, and to keep them in good con
dition. In granting this petition the
board reserves the right to rescind its
action at any meeting.
Shirley Baker then made a proposi
tion to the board to have the athletic
association assume all the responsibility
of the expenses of the Glee Club, and
have them in turn pay all receipts from
their entertainments into the athletic
fund. The Glee Club is to be fur
nished with a regular instructor The
board agreed to stand the responsibility
of all expenses incurred in a trip of the
Glee Club to Stockton on the 21st. inst.,
and if the venture is successful will
probably take the organization in hand
permanently.
It has been suggested that the '96-
'07 football game scheduled for Satur
day afternoon be played Friday after
noon. This is why we think the change
should be made: The Pacific coast
championship field day occurs in San
Francisco Saturday afternoon, and
several Stanford men are entered. If
the game is played Friday the players
can, if r hey ho desire, have all day
Saturday at their own disposal.
