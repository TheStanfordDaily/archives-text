The time of the daily football prac
tice, while conforming may bo in the
main, to the convenience of those who
have laboratory work in the afternoon,
is so late that little or no time inter
venes between a student athlete's great
est physical exercise and his priuoipal
daily meal. Training of this kind
under other conditions than those which
necessarily obtain at this University
would probably be accompanied by the
best results; but as it is the football
player rushes from the field to the bath
and from the bath to the table. It is
not surprising that, with such a regu
lation, a feeling of weariness takes pos
session of the football pla)cr and finds
him not in that condition of vigor and
energy which his regular exercise
would produce if properly timed.

In signing their names to the foot
ball pledge the men have imposed upon
themselves a sacred trust, and in so do
ing have their honor at stake. It is
not necessary to say that all men are
addicted to some bad habits which are
ruinous to constitutional and mental
development. To overcome these
habits is to render to the person a ser
vice which cannot be overestimated.
Good health and good habits go hand
in hand and are the outgrowth of each
other; but as soon as one single mal
icious habit enters into this happy state
of things, a change in the other direc
tion is soon noticed. t*'o we say a good
healthy stare of the body can best be
attained by an abstinence from all hah
its which will in any way show their
evil tendencies in the physical condi
tion. It is to be hoped that no one
will bo so .devoid of self-respect and
honor as to violate this solemn oath.
If he does, no opportunity should be
given him to redeem himself.

The enthusiasm imparted to the
football players, and the encouragement
given then) by the presence of a large
number of spectators, is often destroyed
by the unfeeling criticism of the crowd
and the tendency to take too much not
ice of the errois made by individual
players.
The intense interest felt by every
student in the development of the team
cannot excuse fora moment the cheers
with which many of the censures of

our coach are received. It is sufficiently
trying to the player to take with grace
the public criticism of Bliss, without
having them emphasized hy boisterous
approval on the part of the spectator
A player has said already that there is
a decided reward in football when the
onlookers are appreciative instead of
critical; but when the disapproval of
fellow students is added to that of the
coach, it takes all the energy and am
bition from the player.
It is the business of the coach to cen
sure, that of the bystanders to approve |
what veris worthy, and to pass over the |
mistakes common to every practice game, j
