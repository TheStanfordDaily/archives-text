# Yesterday's Football Practice
## 
### 
The play was char cterized last nijjlit
by more snap and vim than has been
seen on the field fora week. The game
was really interesting, and possessed
several good features. Much of this
was due to the fact that the second
eleven is picking up rapidly, and of
necessity as it grows stronger the game
becomes more closely contested.
Cochran was at his old position of

tackle for the first time this year and
showed his old time phenomenal play
ing. lie was in at every scrimmage,
tackled hard, and made two touch
downs f'or the Varsity team. Frank
enheimer was transferred to the secoud
eleven, and Lewis and Spalding to the
first. The latter must learn to get
down on a punt better. Code still per
sists in his old fault of high tackling,
but this was in part redeemed by his
good interference.
The interference and team work are
slowly growing bettor, but thÂ°re is yet
room for improvement. From the pres
ent outlook every candidate for the
team will play for all that is in him in
order to make a good showing against
Berkeley on Thanksgiving day.
