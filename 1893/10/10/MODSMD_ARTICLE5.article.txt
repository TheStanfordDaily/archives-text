# Sketches of Haweis.

### 
One of the, pleasing features of the
talk given by the llev. Mr. Haweis
last week was the presence of a broad
and liberal heterodoxy. His exhorta
tion to separate Christ from Christianity
is well illustrated by an incident re
lated by Prof. Hudson which reveals
bis spirit and his intolerance of the
cant pervading the orthodox Christian
ity of his church. While conducting
service in a prominent church in Eng
land the choir began to sing a chant
containing the words "O Lord, curse
mine enemies.' The reverend gentle
man turned toward the choir and said
in that peculiar way of his: "Stop
that; it is not in accordance with Chris
tianity. I cannot allow that here."
