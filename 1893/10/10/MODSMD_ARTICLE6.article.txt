At the meeting of the Zoological
Club last night Mr. Price gave a very
instructive talk on the mammals of the
California peninsula. His talk was
illustrated by a specimen of each species.
Three mammals known to be on the pen
insula but which have not yet been
seen by any members of the elub are
the civet cat, the deer, and the black
bear.
Miss Hartley gave a report on the
three specimens of bats found on the
campus—two species are confined to
California, the other ran»es over the
whole of the United States.
Mr. Van Denburgh gave a short
talk on the lizards of the peninsula.
Some six hundred specimens have been
taken but only six species are repre
sented.
Dr. Gilbert made some interesting
remarks conccrning a snake of the boa
constrictor family which had been sent
to the club by Mr. Rich.
