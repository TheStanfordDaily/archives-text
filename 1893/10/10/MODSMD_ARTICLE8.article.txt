The work of the Y M. C. A.for the
present year is already well under way.
A plan has been suggested which will
unite under one head the various
Christian organizations of the Univer
sity so that the work may be carried on
with the greatest possible results.
The free reading room at Mayfield
and the Sunday meeting at the stock
farm will be continued as usual. Daily
Hible classes are being organized
among the students. A Y. M. C. A.
meeting will be held in the chapel every
Wednesday from 1:30 to 2 p.m. The
first one is held tomorrow All inter
ested are heartily invited to be present
at the meetings.
