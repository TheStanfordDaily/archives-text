# NEED OF UNSUCCESSFUL MEN.
## Lecture Delivered Last Evening by Prof. Ross. 
### 
Prof. Ross illustrated the American
standard of success, citing those who
monopolize industr es for personal giii>â€¢,
who abuse and misuse institutions to
increase their own wealth. These are
the dangerous classes in America
today. They ar3 the anarchists, who
overthrow institutions by making them
unpopular and od ous to our citizens.
We need today a spirit of civicism, a
willingness to sacrifice for the defense
of our institutions. We need men who
have breadth of view and are capable of
being le ders in all departments of
commercial life, but who choose to be
unsuccessful in order tnat they may
protect the world from successful men
We need those who will attend to the
interests of the wronged public.
This band of refusers-of-success will
meet difficulties in reform The public
may be ungrateful and the end may be
uncertain, but time will be on their
side. The progress of humanity is ever
towards truth, and justice will prevail.
Life would not be worth living were
it not for its supreme moments We
want to seek these and let the rest go.
Such moments come only in victory
won on behalf of the public, victory
won in behalf of the right.
