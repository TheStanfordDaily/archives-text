Some ordinarily considerate persons,
and some not considerate, derive a great
de>l of pleasure from sweet communion
with each other in the library. If only
those conversing were occupying the li
brary the practice might not be out ol
place; but as many students who desire
to read and study are there at the same
time, the matter deserves our atteution.
It is hard enough to study in a general
reading room, with a door constantly on
the swing, and some one passing at
every other moment, without having
the additional curse of a buzzing con
versation near by. Such a conversation
iliay be more interesting than if carried
on in some other, an ( more proper,
place, according to the theory that for
bidden things, etc., are the sweetest
Yet we think that even this pleasure
might be dampened if the conversers
could only hear the silent anathemas
that are floating upward from all about
them.
Library talking cannot be defended,
even on the basis of concentration of
mind being taught those who arc trying
to read. Things taught against one's
will are apt to be received with a poor
grace, and most people would rather
learn concentration in some othor and
less annoying manner. A word or two
now and then with a neighbor at the
table, or a query about studies, is not at
all out of the way. It is the cosy chat
carried on by those who are tired of
their books that should be nipped so
that even the bud will not appear again.
The librarian has issued rules, and an
noyed readers have cast murderous
glanccs galore, but all to no elfect,; those
distracting talks go on and on.
We think we are voicitig a general
desire when we express the hope that
library readers who indulge in this of
fense will hereafter be more consider
ate, both of their own time and of the
feelings of those about them.
