modern linguistic studies. It is true
that last year several conversational
classes were instituted, but these arc
but little heard of now, and the interest

We of Stanford, who arc so energetic
in other departments of collegiate work,

Almost nothing could be more con

of such a close study of a work, having
before us the signal successes of other

surely to take some steps to bring about
a like practice ui our own college.
Our Junior and Senior classes ought
indeed to be well qualified to take up
such a scheme and bring it to a success

We offer the suggestion for what it

enthusiastic students of ti e modern
language departments may feci strongly

set it on foot. It would be a great
source of pride and satisfaction for us
to see Stanford the first college on this
coast to foster an undertaking which,
although fraught with many difficulties,
promises such great reward.
