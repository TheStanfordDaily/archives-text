# All about the Horses

### 
The i'alo Alto stock farm is a sub
ject of interest to all those who may
come to the Puofic coast. It is doubly
interesting to the students of Stanford,
since it is, in a way, an integral part of
the University, At the present time
certain changes are being made, and
the farm will be run on a some
what different Lasis in the future from
that of the past.
Kur years the chief aim of the stock
farm has been to develop horses in the
right direction, regardless of expense.
Senator Stanford's great desire was to
increase the value of trotting stock!
throughout the United States. Now
the farm will be run on a money-mak
ing basis, although breeding for speed
on ti.e lines believed in by Senator
Stanford will still be continued. There
is no doubt in the minds of those in
charge of the trotting establishment)
but that a income will hereafter
b<- derived from the stock.
In the past much surplus stock
w is kept at Vina ranch, as the senator j
thought so much of his horses, one and
all, that he disliked to part with any. i
This surplus stock, excepting those
animals that the senator was particularly
fond of, will lie sold; and regular sales i
will be made every year. The young '
horses being fitted for the track, and a
hundred choice brood mares, will be
kept. At Vina ranch there arc stables,'

tracks, and a similar establishment
throughout to the one here, only on a
less extensive scale. For the future,
however, all horses will be trained at
Palo Alto.
This year (lie chief sales will be in
New York and Kentucky, Forty
animals were shipped a few days ago
for the Kentucky sale. The New York
sale will take place October 2(5, and
will include a hundred head, mostly
young animals. There has also been a
large sale at Sacramento during the past
month. In all, (>OO horses will be sold
and about the same number retained.
Most of the Palo Alto stock in the past
has found a market in the eust. The
running farm will follow this plan oi
yearly sales and will in future be sim
ply a breeding establishment. The
reputation of the horses is such that this
plan can be successfully carried out.
The records for this season are notes
pccially important, as all the horses on
the various circuits are young. One of
the yearling trotters, Sweet llose, has
reduced the record to 2:25ij, which is
within half a second of the world's
yearling record. By winning an im
portant race Avion has brought a 81,000
prize to the Palo Alto stock farm,
where he was bred. Some of the
records held by horses now at the farm
are: Advertiser, 2:151; Electricity,
2:17;]; Hernal, 2:17; and Truman, 2:12.
One thing perhaps not generally known
concerning the racing of Palo Alto
stock is the fact that Senator Stanford
never raced his horses for money, in
the common acceptance of the term.
Only enough money for expenses is
accepted, the main thing in putting
horses on the track being to develop
and exhibit them in order to command
a sale.
Amazingly large sums lnve been
offered and paid for different horses
bred by Senator Stanford. Arion sold
to Forbus of Boston for $125,000,
Offers of 840,000 have been made for
Truman, and of 8150,000 for both
Advertiser and Electricity. Even a
weanling has brought as high as 812,-
500. A cult that is thought much of
at the farm now is Mary Osborne.
This w: s the last horse named by the
Senator, and one that he thought would
eventually become a world beater.
The farm lias lost none of its ideal
farm look since the death of Senator
Stanford, and many words of praise
are bestowed on Mrs. Strnford's man
agement by those in charge. Her busi
ness ability is the surprise and admira
tion of all coming in contact with her.
As it was the express wish of Lcland
Stanford that the stock farm should be
kept up, all are glad to note how well
its affairs are progressing.
