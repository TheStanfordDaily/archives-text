Two fiood full teams lined up last
night, and about a half-dozen substi
tutes were left over. The varsity team
is still badly crippled by the absence of
several of its best men, and the second
eleven is greatly strengthened by the
appearance of some promising new can
didates. Thus the games are more
interesting.
The teams when they first came out.
showed but little spirit themselves,
but soon got warmed up to
their work and played a more
rushing game. The features of the
play were Burnett's good stops of wedge
plajs at center and Kennedy's good
punting. The latter, however, showed
a decided weakness in returning the
ball on a punt from the opposing full
back. The ends played a more dashing
game than usual, and got dowu the
field well on all punts. The line work
in general was slow, lacking in team
play, and not half aggressive enough.
High tackling seems yet to be the
crying evil, and one that, unless im
mediately remedied, will prove fatal to
effective work. Fumbles were alto
gether too frequent, and the men did
nut follow and fall ou the ball quickly
enough on such occasions.
The playing of the backs was con
spicuously weak, and too much running
back and along the line instead of
cutting through and following inter
ference, was indulged in. Lewis in
particular w a culpable in this respect.
