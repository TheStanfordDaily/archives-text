Now that the Tenuis Club has its
petition granted in regard to the use of
the courts, we hope to see a decided
improvement in the style of playing,
and also in the management of the
game. But such improvement cannot
come so quickly if the sympathy and
encouragement of the student body is
not with the club, which is trying hard
to make the game here one that we
need not be ashamed of, and to place it
iu the list of worthy inter-collegiate
games. We think it ought to be so,
and hope that all complaint about the
monopoly of the club will be stopped.
We believe in giving the club an
equal show with the other student or
ganizations. The tournament for the
# double championship of the University
begins today and is open to all
The finals will be played on Saturday,
and it is not asking too much to desire
that all who can will be present to
witness the game and show appreciation
for the good playing. The single
championship tournament be-ins Wed
nesday next. It is open to all, and
.should be participated in by each
player in the University, regardless of
urade or style of playing.
