The Occident in copying the statis
tics of the two universities published in
t lie Daily Palo Alto last week, adds
the following comment:
There are a few more new students
than noted, but it, is approximately cor
rect. To fill in the blanks as to grad
uate students we are authorized by the
recorder to name 40 old graduate stu
dents and 20 new. The number of the
members ot' the faculty, leaving out the
purely administrative officers, is 87 and
not 08, as the I'aiy Palo Alto
This gives nine more in the Berkeley
faculty. As far as totals are concerned
we would like to ask how many prepar
atory students are enrolled this year as
undergraduates at Palo Alto That
many were so enrolled last year is an
undoubted fact, and it is probable many
are so enrolled this year. We would
like to count in our law and medical
students as well, for many of their stu
dents are taking major work in law and
physiology. We might be allowed to
count in our art students as several of
the students in Palo Alto are taking
architecture as major. Counting spec
ial"! at both places, though some are
really academic students, and including
at both placcs law and medicine stu
dents we would have for Stanford 77â™¦>
and for Berkeley 1)08. That such a
plan is eminently fair will be conceded
by all.

Our authority for the statement re
garding the faculty of the University
of California was the official "Directory
of Officers in the Colleges at Berkeley,"
issued Sept. 0, 1893. This directory
contains ninety-one names, and includes
two stenographers, three clerks, two
secretaries, one ce'larman, one univer
sity printer, one armorer, one foreman
of experiment station, one recorder
one woman's physician, one inspector of
experiment station, one mechanician,
one as.-i-tant librarian, one curator of
th 3 museum, and seven fellows, llow
ever, we stand corrected.
As to Berkeley's counting its stu
dents in law, medicine, and art in a
comparison of this sort, it will be en
tirely proper when the University of
California makes of its students in law,
medicine, and art the same requirements
for entrance and graduation as of stu
dents in its other departments, and
when law, medicine, and art are placed
under the same academic management
and association as the departments at
Berkeley; in other words, when law,
medicine, and art become departments
of the university, and not professional
schools.
As to our fabled preparatory claps, it
dues not exist. There are uo prepara
tory students eniolled as undergrad
uates. It is true that at I'ulo Alto, as
at all other universities, there is more
or less demand for preparatory instruc
tion on the part of students euteriug
with conditions. It is also true that
some special students enter with the
intention of becoming regular students.
The demand for such preparatory in
struction is met at Palo Alto, as at
other universities, mainly by the forma
tion ot private classes under tutors,
who are usually graduate students in
the University. At Stanford there are
such private classes in English, elemen
tary algebra, plaue geometry, and ele
mentary Latin. Inquiry at the regis
trar's office elicits the fact that there
are just eiyht students, all specials, en
rolled in the University who are taking
more preparatory work than University
work. Other persons residing near the
University are also permitted to enter
these private classes; but they are not
enrolled in the University and have no
connection with it.
Our statistics were compiled and
printed as a matter of news. We
should have been more than human had
we not felt some pride in the favorable
showing made,by Stanford; and we may
confess that our pleasure was not less
keen because at the beginning of the
third year Stanford was shown to
lead the older university by nearly a
hundred students At the same time
we rejoice heartily in the steady in
crease in attendance and prosperity of
our sister university, and some day, if
she should really pass us in the race,
we trust that we shall have the grace to
make suitable acknowledgement.
