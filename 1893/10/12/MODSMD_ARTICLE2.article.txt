# Football Practice.

### 
About thirty candidates appeared for
practice last night, and after the usual
|»relimitiary practice went hard to work
at the regular game. The second
eleven put up a star game, and when
IMiss shouted "Play slnrp there, Var
sity— the second eleven is playing all
around you," everyone voiced the same
opinion. In line-bucking, end plays,
and puntinir, the second team played
fully as well as the first.
Dating the o:irly part of the practice
the ball was continually in the territory
of the fir.-t team, and at one time was
dangerously near a touchdown. How
ever not a touchdown was made by
either side, although the game con
tinued until the moon and stars came
out. The spectators cheerod the sec
ond team heartily for their good show
ing, and they certainly deserve great
credit
Trie play was faster than usual, but
yet very locsc. Tod m iny fumbles are

made for this time in the football sea
son. Some invidual playing was good;
but team-work, interference and line
work is still weak.
The Varsity did not make a single
hole in their opponents' line. The
three center men were particularly
slack i ) this respect; they sectu to think
that they do their duty if they merely
hold the opposite man. The features
of the game were Frankenheimer's good
tackling, and Greenwood's falling on
the ball. The latter fell on the ball on
a fumble five times in succession.
