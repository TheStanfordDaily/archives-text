# Sketches of Haweis.

### 
An episode in his life, occuring tit, a
time when he was smaller than at pres
ent, is told by another member of the
faculty. When he was Master Haweis
he had read many of Tennyson's poems
and had been greatly impressed by
them, lie determined to call and see
Mr. Tennyson, and get a glimpse of the
man who had so great attractions for
him. (Joing to the house at an unfor
tunate time he found that A'r. Tenny
son was never at home to any one at
that hour of the day. He succeeded
in seeing Mrs. Tennyson, however, and
told her how much he wished to see
Mr Tennyson, with the addition, that
if she would ask the poet to grant the
request that he was sure that Mr.
Tennyson would do so. Mr. Tennyson
came downstairs, and seeing the young
ster, asked him what he wanted.
Haweis did not know what to say, but
blurted out, "I only wanted to see you,
sir." Tennyson, somewhat annoyed,
turned on his heel and disappeared.
Ilaweis was not satisfied yet, and on
noticing an old envelope addressed in
Mr. Tennys ill's writing, asked that lie
might he allowed to retain it as ;i sou
venir. In later years when the poet
was renowned and Mr. Ilaweis was
famous the latter gentleman referred to
the incident, but it appeared to have
completely faded fiom the mind of the
laureate.
