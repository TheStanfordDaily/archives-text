Robert Tolniie, under the auspices
of the Glee Club, will be here Friday j
night. Mr. Tolniie is highly reconi-j
mended as au artist, and will no doubt,
give an entertainment that will be a
treat to all who attend. From the i
I
many press notices he has received the I
following have been deemed worthy of J
the attention of the public:
11' the Berkeley Athenaeum continues !
to give as mood entertainments as those
already offered it will be a veritable
boom to Berkeley. TheTolmie recital,
which took place at the Assembly llall j
under its aupices, was the best tiling of
its sort ever given in town. Mr. Tol
niie has much expression in his play
ing, a sympathetic touch, and wonderful
intelligence in interpretation. - Berkeley
Herald.
Robert Tolniie by his superb playing
charmed all who heard hiui. He is
certainly at least the equal of any pian
ist who lias visited this city, and unlike
so many other eminent professionals in
his line is devoid of ridiculous nnuner
isms and offensive affectations—Sacra
mento Record-Union.
Mr. Tolniie is a most excellent per
former on the piano. His touch is
masterly, his execution brilliant, and lie
lias that quali y of sympathy which be
trays the artist and makes his interpre
tations of the works of the old musical
masters a positive revelation to the ord
inary hearer.—Sacramento Bee.
The rendering of the mreat masters'
compositions at the Tabor Grand Opera
House last evening indicated that
Robert Tolniie is a true artist not only
as to technique but as to interpretation.
— Denver Times.
He nukes the piano a veritable thing
of life and feeling, and a better satisfied
audience than listened to him last even
ing has not assembled in this city. The
piano became a thing of animation
under his magical touch. He depicted
in harmonious strains all conceivable
passions and emotions, and they stood
out in bold relief so the dullest com
prehension could discern and appreci
ate them —Salt Lake Tribune.
Mr. Tolniie has few equals as a
pianist. His execution is faultless, and
his selections on this occasion placed
him in perfect sympathy with his audi
ence —Santa Rosa, Cal., Democrat.
Mr. Tolniie will use a Steinway Con
cert Grand.
