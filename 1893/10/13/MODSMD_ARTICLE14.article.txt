Every student in the University
realizes the vital importance attaching to
the work of the second eleven, whose
showing during the past week lias been
subject to both pnise and criticism.
Every encouragement, however, should
be given to the individual members of
the eleven; the success of the final issue
depends largely upon the efforts they
put J'orth daily in preliminary work
against the Varsity. Each man should
realize this fact and fill his position as
though personally responsible to the
institution and his colleagues for victory
on Thanksgiving Day.
