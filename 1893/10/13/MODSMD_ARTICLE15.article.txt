The Cl:.as of DO merits the greatest
commendation in deciding to give
the (/lass of '97 a reception. Ev
idently social life at the Univer
sity is to have a revival. We
hope this is so, and expect this to be
the beginning of the long waited lor
reaction against the entire lack of the
social entertainments which play such
an important part in college life else
where. A man's social side should be
developed as well as his intellectual,
and when can he obtain such training
better than during bis college days? If
he gives up his entire four 3 ears to cease
less study he is bound to graduate de
veloped along that line to the entire
exclusion of his ability to appear well
in society. Now, however, we seem to
be changing our tastes. We seem to
have branched out very suddenly. A
concert and this reception in as many
weeks seems incrediblo to us <juiet
Stanford students; still it pleases us,
and we hope that many similar events
will be announced in the near future.
