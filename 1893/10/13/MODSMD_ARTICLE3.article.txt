# Football Practice.

"The shades of ni«»ht were fulling
fast" yesterday, before the Varsity
made a touchdown against the second
eleven. For two successive nights the
second team has given the Varsity all
they wanted to do and has put up a
class of football but little excelled by
that of their opponents. It is a not
iceable fact that the Varsity gets de
cidedly the woist of the play in the
early stage of the practice, and begins
to brace up only alter about half an
hou-'s hard work It would be a good
scheme if the practice could be finished
before dark, and furthermore it would
contribute much to the comfort of the
players if the grounds could be thor
oughly wet. down.
The play is slowly improving, but
fumbles are altogether too frequent, es
peciallybetwecn the centre and quar
ter. When a fumble is made there is '
too much slowness in falling on the i
ball The line work continues to be I
erratic, and the tendency to high tack
ling has not yet been thoroughly over
come. Russell w:is transferred to the
lirst eleven and played half back, while

| llarrelson took Russell's place on the
j second team. Frankcnheitncr and
■ Greenwood each made several good
; tackles, and McKay did some very good
punting. The practice is growing
i harder, a'>d more determined and busi
ness'like every night, and each man
j seems to make his motto, ''Do or die."
