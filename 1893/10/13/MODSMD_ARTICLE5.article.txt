Resides these the two halls consume
1 bbl. syrup, 10 gals. Worcestershire
sauce, and 15 gals, tomato catchup,
and the training table receives one hind
quarter extra beef per day and three
sheep per week.
It will thus be seen that Roble uses
about one-seventh of the meat, same of
potatoes; one-half of the milk and eggs
for little over one-third of the students.
Ruble receives eighteen gallons of iccd
cream every Sunday, which accounts for
the excessive use of eggs and milk
The grocery bill for last month amounted
to $950, and the butcher bill to over
$1000, for both halls. No complaint
as to the quality of food has yet been
heard, and both the committee and Mr.
Never, the genial and accommodating
Steward, will be pleased to right any
wrong brought to their notice.
