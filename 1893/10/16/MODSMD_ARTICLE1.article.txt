# CHAMPIONSHIP MEET.
## Annual Field Day of the Pacific Association of the Amateur Athletic Union, Records Made by Stanford Men. 
### 
As usual on such an occasion, the day
was a most disagreeable one, and the
fog blew in from the ocean in great
clouds and rendered excellent perform
ances impossible. The boys who n
tered from here failed to make a very
good showing in the hundred, and al
though we had a man in every heat we
failed to score a point in the finals. In
the trial heat for second men we had
three entries, and Woodward, as win
ner, was entitled to run in the finals.
When at the eighty yard mark, how
ever, in the final heat Woodward
spraiued a tendon and went all to
pieces, losing all chance of a place.
In the high hurdles our representa
tive, It. K. Culver, '97„ who, by the
way, is one of our most promising ac
quisitions with the incoming class, ran
second. Considering that; he has done
almost no training at all for this event,
his performance was little short of
phenomenal.
In the 220 yard dash our hopes were
again thrown to the ground, for although
HI lis, '97, ran a game and plueky race
he was un-ihls to land a placc
When the mile was finished every
Stanford sympathizer went wild, for
Hrown, '1)7, had won, and had
brought the very creditable coast record
of 4 tuin. sec for this event to
I'ulo Alto When Brown showed up
so poorly last, April in the intercollegiate j
games many thought he had seen his
best days; but since Saturday's per
formance all are again willing to pin
their faith to him as being invincible
at this distance.
In the 4+o yard dash our man was
again crowded out, and failed to get a
place. Fry ran a good strong race at
lirsf, and although apparently in excel
lent condition, he seemed to lack vigor
at the finish
Calhoun, '95, won the running high
jump without an effort, and although he
did not clear the bar at so great a i
height as last spring, he went as j
high us was necessary to win. Hisl
jump was 5 ft 2} in.
In the pole vault Crane, '95, won a I
second place. Culver also failed to
score a point in the running broad jump, j
In general our bovs did as well as I
could have been expected without !
training. In track events the men had
a good excuse for lack of condition but
in the field events no excuse can be
made on this score.
As to tin: other participants, Koch, I

! U. C., ran a phenomenal half mile, cov
ering the distance in 2 minutes 2J sec
onds, thus establishing a new coast
©
record; and Taylor, 0. C., also made
1 excellent time in the three mile run,
setting the mark for this distance at 16
minutes 20•} seconds. Scoggins, IJ. C.,
'97, who won bo'h the 100 and 220, al
though only a freshman, is a cyclone
j sprinter, and unless something new de
velops pretty soon, will have a mortgage
ion both events for our next spring in
ter-collegiate meet. lie is a wonderful
runner, both as to speed :iud staying
powers, and with a year or two more of
maturity will be the equal of any run
ner ou the coast.
Of the all-roujd men F. F Foster,
! O. C., made by far the best showing,
running second in the hundred, first in
! both high and low hurdles, and also in
the running broad jump. His record
|of 22 feet 6 iuches in the last named
event is indeed most excellent.
