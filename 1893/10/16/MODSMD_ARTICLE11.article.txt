The first ten minutes of the Tuesday
veiling lecture are constantly inter
rupted by persons coming in late.
When the lecture was given at hall
past seven the same persons were the
source of the disturbance. From this
it would seem that the cause of this
tardiness is wholly personal and not at
all due to the lecture being given half
an hour earlier than before. Those
who use their prerogative to come in
at the lirst door alter the lecture has
begun are the least pardonable <5f all
offenders; they come in with an apol
ogetic air which would not be neces
sary it' they would use the second door.
It was a noteworthy feature in Mrs.
Stanford, and one which added much
to the beauty of her character, that she
always used the door which would
eause the least commotion when comiuÂ»
in late, and it is highly desirable that
her example should be followed by the
stars of lesser magnitude.
