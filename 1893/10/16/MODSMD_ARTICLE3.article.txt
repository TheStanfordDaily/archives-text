ofi Saturday morning between the thin
longs and the fat shorts of '95 and '!>('Â»
and was very amusing to the spectators.
liOts of energy was shown, much was !
wasted, aud more was dis-M>atcd in !

chattering and disputing over the par
tiality of the referee.
The men lined up as announced in
last issue. The '96 half-backs did some
good work. Potter played with the
vim and pluck of a veteran, and was
well supported by the line and ends.
Capt. Baldwin, '90, did some heavy
work but was disabled in body during
the first part, although he remained
until the finish and gave the team his
moral support.
1 he Juniors played with the dignity
and bearing common to their caste.
Shirley Baker, full-back on '95 team,
did work full of good intentious, as
did also Grove and Donald, the '95
half-backs. The game ended with a
score of G-0 in favor of '90.
