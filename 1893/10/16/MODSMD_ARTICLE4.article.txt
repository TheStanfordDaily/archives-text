# The
						Piano Recital.

### 
A somewhat moderate though very
appreciative audience greeted Mr.
Robert Tolmie, the pianist, who ap
peared for the tir.st time before the fac
ulty and students of the University on
Friday evening of last week. Mr.
Tolmie introduced himself with a very
interesting program which comprised
compositions'by the classic, the roman
tic, and even the most recent pyrotech
nic school, thus giving the audience an
opportunity to judge of the artist's tech
niquo as well as of his conception and
feeling. While in regard to his tech
nical ability Mr. Tolmie proved him
self an earnest, studious artist of con
siderable attainments, his playing
lacked that depth of conception and
feeling which reveals itself in touch
and tone and which, after all, makes the
great artist. This was especially notic
able in the second movement of the
Beethoven sonata and in the selections
from Schumann, those exquisite piano
poems which will always prove a test
for the great player. Besides, we
think that Mr. Tolmie at times, as for
example in the already mentioned
second movement of the Beethoven
sonata, hastened the time and thus de
prived himself of a good deal o artistic
effect which is due merely to proper
repose.
In spite of these remarks, which a
musical critic has to make, the concert,
was a most enjoyable affair, thoroughly
appreciated by the audietce, as the
artist could judge from the frequent
and hearty applause.
