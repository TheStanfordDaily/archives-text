# ANOTHER FRATERNITY
## 
### 
Beta Theta Hi was founded at Miami
University, Oxford, Ohio, in July,
1839. It was the first fraternity
founded west of the Alleghanies. At
that time the Alpha Delta Phi was the
only fraternity at Miami, but the better
class of men refused to join that frater
nity, as the members were very haughty
towards the neutral element. The
Beta Theta Pi was founded in opposi
tion to the Alpha Delta Phi.
At the outset Beta Theta Pi thrived
on the very best material at Miami.
The spirit of extension was very marked
at the beginning, and today the chapter
roll is exceeded in numbers only ly
one other fraternity.
The Stanford chapter was organized
last Saturday night at Berkeley under
the auspices of the U.C. chapter. The
charter members are Jenness, Hoag,
Richard «on, Thompson, and Ingham (old
members), and W. W. Price, Chester
Magee, Delos Magee, Douglas Watson,
and Vanderveer (the recent initiates).
Prof. Smith, of the geology depart
ment, is also a member of Beta Theta
Pi.
