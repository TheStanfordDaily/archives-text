The letting loose in a boarding lull
ola horde of crude musicians with in
sfcuments difficult to play, shou'd be
considered, in the future, as a capital
offense. Anyone not living in lOnc'wia
Hall cannot imagine the babel of sound's
prevalent there before the executive
committee regulated the hours of music
practice. One student who wished to
work hard, had for his neighbor 011
the right a man with a trombone; on
his left, a fiddle was played at intervals
throughout the evening; above him
football signals were practiced occasion
ally; an'd welling up from below
through the ventilator would come the
sonorous tones of a man, more trying
than all the others together, who per
sisted in throwing a wealth of feeling
and desire into the hymn, '-Hide me,
011 my Savior hide." Such a combi
nation as this is amusing once in a b ng
while, but when it is the rule life be
comes unendurable, and the suflerer is
justified in taking extreme measures to
stop it. [t is hoped that the executive
committee will be prompt in enforcing
obedicnce to the regulations passed by
them, and in doing so they will have the
support and esteem of every student.
