Im all probability there will be a very
satisfactory reduction in tbe price of
board for November. Mr. Never is
assured that board of better quality than
that at present supplied can be given
fur SI- oO a mouth il' the number of
boarders cau be made to reach 400 (in
eluding those at Koble). The cause of
the higher price paid in Septetnb' rand
<iuri' g the present mouth is found iu
the fact tlv.t much of the table furni
ture had to be replaced, waiters had to
be supplied with towels arid aprons, and
many miscellaneous expenses incident
to starting the hall occurred during the
first month.
The matter of table service needs
some notice. It is tbe wish of the stu
dent body that students be employed as
waiters, but it is imperative that stu
dents discharge their duties with the
greatest possible energy and good will.
Of late they have sadly f'aited in this
respect, causing great annoyance to all
cuioerned
