M Ruisson, a commissioner of edu
cation sent by the French government
to the World's visited us this
summer at Stanford, and on his return
home, makes this passing notice of his
visit iu au article in the Revue Bleur
fur September 30, 1893
"There lias never been, it would ap
pear, such a crisis as that which now
exists in California. The railroads are
bankrupt, the steamboat companies are
jeducing the wages of their employees,
many banks have suspended payment,
the number of unemployed workmen in
creases from day to day, wheat and
fruit are at the lowest price, and stagna
tion extends to every branch of busi
ness. 'No one has a dollar,' an cmi'
n'Mit. professor of the new Stanford
University said to me yesterday. This
is a university on which its founder,
the late Senator Stanford, has
spent the bagatelle of $20,000,000; yes,
it is a fact, 100,000,000 francs So difli
cult is the settlement of the Stanford
estate, on account of the extraordinary
financial crisis, that, even the professors
of this wealthy university jÂ»re at this
moment wondering if they will get
theii salaries five or six months from
now. No pity need be wasted on them,
however; they will lose nothing by

waiting, and their salaries are such as
would cause the most, devoted Jof our
French university professors to desert
their litres and pe notes."
