Editor Daily Palo Alto:
What is the object of the charge re
quired fora key to a gymnasium locker,
when there is no particular iricenrive or
no rebate for the return of the key?
It would seem much more business-like
to require the present amount simply
as a security for the safe return of the
key. As ii is now it is cheaper for one
man to purchase the key at a reduced
rate from someone who has given up
his locker. There is an incentive for
the latter man to get what he can for
the key, for if lie never returned it it
would not he charged up against him.
