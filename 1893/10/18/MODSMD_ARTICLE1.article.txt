# JORDAN'S LECTURE.
## Evolution of the College Curriculum 
### 
A crowded house and prolonged ap
plause greeted the introduction of Dr
Jordan to his audience last night. The
substance of the lecture is as follows:
In spite ol all eccentricities in name
or form, we cm recognize the existence
of a certain definite typo of school which
we may call the American college.
'I'llis college possesses a more or less
definite college curriculum. Of the
changes iu this curriculum I wish now
to speak. We can go back in England
to the time when the philosophy of
Aristotle constituted the college course
The students noted down the contents
of old books which the master himself
had copied before. After the revival
of learning came the English college
curriculum with its three pedestals of
(ireek, Latin, and mathematics. Of
this the American curriculum has been
a lineal descendant. The fundamental
idea of the American curriculum was
discipline of the mind, and the work
lasted just four years. That the sys
tem was not quite perfect was clearly
the fault of human nature, which fur
nished a very variable article of boy for
the educators to work upon. This
ancient classical course was a powerful
agency for culture to many, hut not to
all. Thus, as the years went on, other
sources of culture became more and
emphatic in their claims. What shall
the college do? Shut out these sub
jects they cannot; so in various ways
it was sought to harmonize the new
education with the old. The Ameri
can college has finally adjusted itself to
a second phase in the history of the
curriculum which I may, for conven
ience, call the patchwork system.
From the struggle between the rep
resentatives of rival subjects has come
about, by way of compromise, the es
tablishment of different courses of study
These courses are simply the re.-ults of
an attempt tu put in a maximum of
topics into a minimum of terms —to
squeeze ten years of subjects into four
years of time. It was said in justifica
tion of this course of study that the
function of the college is to offer a
taste of all sorts of knowledge The
value of persistent study was never
made known lo the student Almost
every result of this cuiriculum was dis
tinctly inferior to that secured by the
old class cal course. In broadening and
modernizing the curriculum, its sharp
miss as an instrument was lost
From the second to the third stage
in its histoiy the curriculum of the
American college is now passing.
This is marked by the advent of the
elective system. All subjects taught
in the college course should be placed
on an equality, so far as the degree is
concerned. No two students require
exactly the same line of work, and the

student is the best judge of his own
needs. The elective system enables
the student to bring himself in contact
with the best teachers. There are, of
course, criticisms of this system, but
they may be easily overcome. Souie
of the weakest features of our college
system centre about the conventional
term of four years and the conventional
baciielur's degree. At best, the bach
elor's degree is an empty name, but the
times are not ready to abandon it.
So much for the phases, past and
present, uf the college curriculum in
America. What of the future'!' With
the new needs and the new men of the
future will come new developments,
new departments, new methods, and
new ideas. The American college of
the future will be a place for self-cul
ture. The old forms in education are
passing away; the old barriers are be
ing taken down. The college boy is
becoming a man and the college woman
now stauds beside him. In the future,
even more than in the past, the Ameri
can university will stand in the front
rank of civilizing influences.
