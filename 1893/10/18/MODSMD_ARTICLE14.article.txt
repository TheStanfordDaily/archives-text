The low students of the University
do not seem to realize, to any extent
whatsoever, the importance of a law de
bating society, especially one which
will take up ihe d'scussion of moor
cases. Can they already have forgotten
Judge Croley's sage advice in his sug
gestions to the students? If they have,
they should by all means re-read the
passages in which that greatest of con
stitutional lawyers says that especial
advant-gi; is to be derived from pursu
ing one's studies in a law school, because
the students are enabled to form them
selves into clubs for the discussion ol
moot cases.
In these clubs one receives the best
possible training in forensic eloquence.
The practice of speaking extempore,
absolutely necess.iry to the lawyer, can
be obtained with the best results. If,
however, au advocate does mike his
first attempt without this experience,
he is very apt. to break down from ner
vousness or emburassment, lor most of
us are not like Alexander Hamilton,
able to make wonderful speeches at first
appearances. We must, on the other
hand, expect our first, attempts to be
dismal failures, capable of being over
come only by the most persistent efforts
These should, by all means be made
before our associates or friends, who
will help us mend our faults, instead of
before the cold public, where many a
young man has given up when subjected
to the scorn and ridicule of an unsym
pathetic and often envious audience.
'fhe attorney, before he begins to
practice, must have confidence in him
self and be pure of his powers To do
this a thorough test should be applied
before the great weight must be sus
tained. To have it thoroughly applied,
thelaw debutingsocioty should bejuined,
which, if well supported and aided by
ou r law department, will largely help
us develop the Krskines and Choates of
the coming century.
