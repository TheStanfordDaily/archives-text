manager to fill the vacancy caused by
the resignation of L 11. Smith. The
dimensions of the Annual were definitely
decided upon, and a request for twenty
dollars from the class treasury was
made of the Class Council, to defray
necessary immediate expenses of draw
ing paper, artist's materials, and writ
ing paper. Of the various names so
far Miggested, Vhe Stanford Quad
seems to meet with the most favor; no
selection of a name, however, has yet
1 een made.
