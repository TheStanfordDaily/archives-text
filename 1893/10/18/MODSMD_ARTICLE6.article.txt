# Football Practice.
## 
### 
The first eleven had an easy time of
it iu last evening's practice. The sec
ond team were handicapped by their
lightness. One noticeable feature of
the game was the end playing of the
first eleven. Walton and Code did
some fine interfering, and touch-downs
were frequently made from the centre
of the field. Lewis made some fine
runs, aided by good interference. Ken
nedy bucked the line well, but is not
doing the interfering that characterized
his playing last year.
Spalding tackled well. Franken
lieimcr was placed at right tackle, and
played a good game. Cochran played
too far out and left too much of a hole
between guard and tackle; this] seems
to be his only weakness. Condit was on
the field again, and played on the second
eleven. He has not forgotten how to
tackle, as was seen by his work last
night.
It is hoped that the second team will
pick up again in its "playing and fur
nish the spectators with such games as
were witnessed in the early part of last
week. Spirited and quick playing are
the only essentials lacking to make
these games interesting.
