# THE 						EDUCATIONAL LABORATORY.
## The 						Methods and Aims of an Experimental Kindergarten. 
### 
A lew words are necessary concern
ing the experimental kindergarten
which is carried on in connection with
the University. As in the other
sciences, a laboratory is an absolute nec
essity in the proper study of education.
For this purpose the free kindergarten
was started on the campus last year,
and has this year been extended to in
clude children up to twelve years of
ago.
It is in no way a preparatory school;
and while it is under the immediate di
rection of Prof. Barnes and Miss Sclial
lenberger. it is taught by the most ad
vanced students of the Kilucational de
partment who wish to carry on some
special line of investigation. For in
stance, one teacher presents drawings iu
order to study the development of form
and proportion in children; another,
reading, in order to study the way in
which children can be led to under
stand written symbols; a third forms a
class of the older students in reading to
determine the sort of liter iture suitable
for children of different ages. In each
of thee cases the teacher adopts the
best methods of teaching known, and
applies tests and results, which are re
ported weekly in the seminary meetings.
The kindergarten is free; the two
higher grades only paying the neces
sary expenses, a fee of three dollars per
mouth for each child. The University
furnishes the buildings and direction.
Among the teachers are some ot the
ablest in the state. Prof. Jenkins and
one of his special students are conduct
ing the wo kin popular science; Mrs
Harnes and Mrs. Lucky the work in
history, and Miss Parke and Miss
Williams have charge of the languages.
Others are doing special work.
The name experimental school may
seeui inappropriate, but it is merely a
laboratory for observing and recording
the changes which take place in the de
velopment of children under the best
iitHlie ices education can devise.
