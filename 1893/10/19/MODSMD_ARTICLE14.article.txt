Kappa Alpha Theta and Kappa
Kap[ia Gamma jointly extended to the
new sorosis, the Pi Beta I 'hi, a hearty
welcome by giving them a reception at
the Theta house. This is indeed a
praiseworthy spirit, and displays a
strong sense of friendship and frater
nity courtesy. In thÂ« East the feeling
between such organizations is very bit
ter, and in many instances, students are
not on speaking terms, for no other rea
son than that they are members of dif
ferent fraternities. It is a very pleas
ing fact that no such feeling exists at
Stanford; and it is a source of gratifica
tion that the tendency is started in the
right direction.
