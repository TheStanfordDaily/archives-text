A COMMUNICATION appears on the
front page of this issue. It is directed
either at a certain class of students who
are carried away with the idea they are
the only persons who appear on the oval
daily to watch the practice games of
football, or to another class who evi
dently believe that their extensive
knowledge of the game should accord
them the privilege of standing far out
on the gridiron field and thus obstruct
the view of the many unfortunates who
wish to gain such exteusive knowledge
by simply looking on.
The poorest way to make one's self
conspicuous is to do so by encroach
ment on the rights of others.
