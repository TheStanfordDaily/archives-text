A singular fatality seems to attach to
the chair of English literature in the
Ohio State University. Prof. Milliken,
the first incumbent, held it four years
and died. lie was succeeded by
Prof. Short, who also lived just four
years. Professor A. H. Walsh, who
next took the chair, died exactly upon
the completion of his fourth year of
service, and wis succeeded four years
ago by Professor Chalmers, who is now
dying at Sparta, Mich.
