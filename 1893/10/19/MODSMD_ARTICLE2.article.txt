Last night's practice was a little bet
ter than the preceding one. Wilson
was back at his old position and played
with lots of life. The line playing was
not good, and -is a consequence the line
plays were a failure. Walton and Code
did some more good interfering for
Lewis, who made two line runs from
the centre of the field over the touch
line. In the last dash, Lewis' knee
was wrenched, which will necessitate
Lis laying oil fora day or so. Burnett
was a lii tie at fault in snapping the hall,
and more fumbles than usual were com
mon. lie broke through the line in
st\le. Spalding was at his best

last night and foil on the ball on several
punts.
For the second eleven McKay, An
drade, Fickert, and Rice did some good
playing.
The Stockton people are sure of see
ing a good team in the second eleven,
and unless their team is much stronger
than last year's the Stanford boys are
going to have a walk-over.

Stockton High School eleven has been
selected. All those whose names ap
pear on the list will leave Kncina Ilall
