C P. Huntington made the follow
ing statement to a New York corres
pondent in answer to the articles pub
lished in San Francisco papers: "There
is nothing in the story. Mrs. Stanford
can have a statement of her husband's
affairs at any time. 1 do not believe
that Mrs. Stanford made the remarks
credited to her; nor do I believe that
there are unsecured loans amounting to
ยง5,000,000 due the estate. I only
know of some $o")0,000 of such loans.
