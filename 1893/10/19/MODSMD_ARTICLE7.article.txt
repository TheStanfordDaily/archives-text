Fiditor Daily Palo Alto:
Although repeatedly asked and urged
by the football management, there are
yet a number of the spectators who, at
every afternoon's practice, persist in
crowding on the held and encroaching
on the space reserved for the players.
The finld is certainly large enough to
accommodate all, and it is only asking
what is right when the management
requests that the spectators confine
themselves to the field outside the
touch-lines or side lines. It is discour
aging to the men making a run round
the end to find themselves hindered
and stopped by a number of people who
have no business within the lines; aud
often some one is seriously hurt by the
stampede caused by the team running
toward the crowd.
It would be ad unnecessary expense
to the athletic association to erect a
fence around the grounds, but such a
step will be rendered necessary if the
on-lookers are not more considerate of
the rights of the players to a clear field,
and, perhaps, of the young ladies in the
background to a glimpse of the game.
