# THE 						STANFORD MILITARY BAND
## The 						Largest and Best Amateur Band on the Coast. 
### 
No student organization since the
opening of the University lias sprung
into life with more enthusiasm and vigor
than the Military Band. It now num
bers forty active members who are un
der the direction and leadership of
Kaufman, '9(3, and it is said already
elipse any amateur band on the coast.
Last night's practice in the gymnas
ium was well attended and several visi
tors wore admitted. The management
have decided to give a concert in the
gymnasium three weeks from tonight,
by which time the members will have
their uniforms. Among the pieces
which will be given on that occasion
will be an amusing descriptive piece en
titled k, Tlie Little German Band,"
"Robin Hood," and a new piece en
titled, "Stanford March." The last is
a composition by Mr. Kaufman, and is
destined to become a popular band
piece. 31 r. Kaufman was given a very
tempting offer for it last week by a
well-known music house in San Fran
cisco, but refused to sell it. The band
is now practicing on it and it will be
played at the next rehearsal.
Leader Kaufitiann has also arranged
' Hail Stanford, Hail" for the band and
will play it at the football game on
Thanksgiving day. The band has a
very large collection of other music
which is worth about $200.
Drum m jor Thomas has been drill
ing the boys so that they will make a
creditable showing when they appear
with the military companies. A seren
ade will be given to\lr.s Stanford and
the row in the near future.

usual ability in their Hue are Camp
