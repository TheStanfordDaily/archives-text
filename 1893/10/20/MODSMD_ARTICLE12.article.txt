There has been considerable com
pliiint lately because of the amount of
profanity used on the oval during tho
practice gimes. The men are not care
ful enough in this regard Every day
there are a number of ladies upon the
grounds who come with the loyal in
tent of encouraging the players. There
is no question but that their presence
does make the men play better, arid we
hope that their visits will not be dis
continued, We are sure that the
players themselves will recflgnize the
fact that common courtesy forbids the
use of profanity upou tho oval when
ladies are present, and we hope that
their good sense will need only this
passing reminder.

Considerable interest is being
manifested in the college world concern
ingjhe School of Journalism receutly
established at the University of Penn
sylvania. Several of our leading col
leges have hitherto failed in attempts to
found like fchools and it remains to be
seen whether this latest attempt will
succeed or not. It is to be hoped that
it will.
There is nothing which has so much
influence upon the popular morals, as
the tone of the press. Hence the im
portance of having men at the head of
our newspapers, who appreciate tl.eir
responsibility and who are qualified to
fill th uir positions. [
Our great universities are beginning
to recognize this fact, and many are
now giving credit for work done upon
college papers. The college faculties
have begun at last to see something of
the far-reaching effects of college train
ing in newspaper work. The day is
not far distant when journalism will
stand on a level with history, economics,
and law in the courses of study in our
great universities, and wheu college
trained journalists at length come to
tnko ehnrjrp of the public press we may
look fora new era in our political prog
ress.

Early in the year a division oc
curred upon the board of managers of
the Cornell Suit, which resulted in one

hall'of' the board starting. c a "private
enterprise" Sun. For some time the
two rival "*s'una" have been published
daily, and all efforts to bring about a
reconciliation between the opposing
factions have been in vain. The stu
dent body met and adopted one of the
publications as the oilicial organ, Pres.
Schurrnann endeavored to induce a
compromise, but nothing discouraged
the "private enterprise.'' At length
both sides agreed to leave the decision
t.o the students, and at a mass meeting
the students voted t<> sustain the orig
inal *Sun.
Thus has ended a controversy
which is without precedent in college
newspaper history. The result should
hcrafter be a warning to cliques which
endeavor to fill responsible offices with
persons who possess no especial fitness
for them. We congratulate the editors
of the Sun upon their success, and
upon the euergy and fairness shown by
them throughout the controversy
