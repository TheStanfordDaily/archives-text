# THE
						STOCKTON GAME.
## The
						First Outside Game This Year. 
### 
liy 2:30 p.m. a considerable crowd
had assembled at God water Grove, the
place where the game was played. Con
spicuous about the grounds were the
"cardinal ' and the ''Slue and white"
trimmings of hats, dresses, bouquets,
and carriages.
Just before the game was called
Koss, the captain of the Stockton team,
introduced "Pop'' Bliss to the specta
tors in the grand stand, before whom
the admired "little fellow" made a short
and pleasing talk about football.
The teams lined up about 2:45 p 111
There was 110 wind and the sunshine
was not too warm. Stanford had the
ball, and by two or three good runs
advaueed it near to their opponents'
goal, where 't was lost on a fumble.
Stockton lost the ball on three downs
Stanford then scored thoir first touch
down, which was done in less than ten
minutes after the game started. McKay
failed to kick a goal. Stockton then
kicked off the ball from centre and lost
it 011 three downs It was soon regained
by them, however, on Stanford's fum
ble, and punted. After several punts
by both sides and some good runs by
Andrade and Lewis another touchdown
was made, and .McKay was successful
iu kicking goal. Stockton again started
the ball from tin centre and Foss made
a good run round the left end, but lost
the bail Lewi*, by two excellent runs,
carried the ball well down the field,
when the end of the first half was
called. Score 10-0 iu favor of the
Stanford team.
Stockton started the second half with
a punt and lost the ball. In the next
play Lewis advanced the ball some dis
tance down the fielu. it was gradually
forced along until near Stockton's goal
line when Andrade made a touchdown
and McKay successfully kicked a goal.
In the play that followed our team lost
ground, letting Stockton score a touch
down. The four points thus gained
and the two made by kicking a goal
were all that the Stockton team scored
in the game My successive short runs
Stanford secured another touchdown,
after which a goal was again kicked.
When time was called our eleven had
advanced the ball to within a few yards
of their opponents' goal line.
Taking it all through it was an easy
victory for our second eleven. The
criticism of the Stockton I' ndvpendent
to the effect that our players were un
necessarily rough is not at all justifi
able. On the o'her hand if our men
had shown as great a tendency to pug
ilism as sonic of their s did, they would
probably have had cause to complain.
The Stockton people are not used to
energetic playing, for every evening's
practice contains rougher scrimmages
than occurred at Stockton.
