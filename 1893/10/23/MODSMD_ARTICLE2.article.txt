Although the audience that attended
the Glee Club concert in the evening
was not so large as might have been
expected, it was fully appreciative.
The program was rendered in excellent
style, every number being encored.
After the audience heard one of Shirley
Baker's comic songs, which he sang for
an encore, they would not be satisfied
until they had him out five times.
When be came 011 the stage the second
time the football players, who occupied
the boxes to the left, all cried out
in unison, "Shirley, we want tomales."
Kennedy's solos were received with
great favor Special mention should
be made of the cornet solo of George
C iinpbell, and the violin solo of Carl
Thomas. Stanford his reason to be
proud of such musicians. The Glee
Club as a whole did remarkably good
work. The comic encores brought
down the house. The concert lasted
until about 10 o'clock, when the audi
ence dispersed, thoroughly satisfied
with the evening's entertainment.
