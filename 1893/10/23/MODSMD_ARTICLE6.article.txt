# Mrs. Leavitt's Lecture.
## 
### 
The attendance at the chapel to hear
Mrs Leavitt last Friday evening was
very small. On this account she did
not deliver the lecture on Temperance
as announced, but gave an informal
talk about her travels among the coun
tries of the Orient. There were many
things of especial interest to students
in her vivid pictures of the social and
religious life of the various heathen
nations of the world, among whom she
she has spent many years of her life.
The most prominent thoughts were the
solidarity of the human race and the in
fluence of the Christian religion, as
compared with the influence of Bud
dhism and Brabminisni, especially
with reference to the rights ot woman.
The physical influence of moral princi
ples as being greater than the differen
tiatioos caused by food and climate was
well illustrated by many personal ex
periences.
