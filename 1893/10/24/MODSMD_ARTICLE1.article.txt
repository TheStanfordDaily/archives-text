# On the Oval

### 
Last night's play was in no way
above the average. The second eleven
were slow in coining out, unnecessarily
delaying the practice. A number of
the second eleven were absent, thus
greatly weakening their team. The
play of the Varsity was (characterized
by dash and vim Walton, Cochran,
and C. Downing made the best runs for
their team. While able to circle the
ends, all attempts of the Varsity to
buck the centre of the second's eleven
seemed useless; the linemen failed to
make the nccessary holes. The tackl
ing was high 'and often failed to bring
down the^ruuners.
The second eleven is to be com
mended for the admirable manner in
which they stopped the bulking of the
Varsity. Paul Downing was out again
last night aud greatly helped to
strengthen the line. The line-up of
the team was as follows:
FIRST TEAM. SECOND TEAM.
Wilson, Capt- re Mcintosh
C. Downing r t Rice.
Burnett r g Williams
Downing c Thomas.
McMillan 1 g Fickert.
Cochran It S rainht.
