'•'he establishment of a reading room
in Eucina lobby would be a departure
which would be appreciated by
all students boarding in the hall. The
antiquated papers and periodicals which
have lain on the tables since college
opened have been read and re-read
until they are worn out A subscrip
tion of twenty-five cents i'rotn each
student in the hall would amount to
sixty-five dollars or more. This amount
would be sufficient to put twenty first
class weekly and monthly periodical*
on the tables, besides the San Francisco
daily papers. Suitable magazine covers
can be provided at a small cost, and
there are plenty of students who would
be willing to take charge of the period
iculs and see that they are properly
filed and put, on the tables as they
arrive. Iloble has a reading room that
is well suppoited. Why not Encina?
At present there is a great dearth of
readable mutter in the hall, and every
novel or illustrated paper that make*
its way into the buildiug is sure to be
read until it is worn out. A reading
room in the lobby would go far towards
supplying the demand for light lit era

calculated to injure the good name of
the institution. Steps were a'so taken
towards discovering the authors of
the report aud publishing their nsfmes.
We are ourselves just ourselves ju>t

who arc outside of the University

probably started as a joke, but the
author should realize that this is a dan

the lair fame of our alma mater should
be above the plane of practical jokes,
and we will be free from such reports
in the future.
