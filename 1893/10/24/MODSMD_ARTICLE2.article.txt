# Trips for the Second Eleven.
## 
### 
Ti e football game at Stockton on
Saturday was the first of a series of
games to be played by the second eleven
during the present season. The man
agement is engaged in making out a
schedule of games for both elevens.
The first eleven will occupy the Christ
mas vacation in playing the various
first class teams on the coast. They
will play the Multnomah Club at Port
land on New Year's Day. On the
same trip they will probacy play the
Seattle Athletic Ciub, also the Tacoma
Athletic C üb. Manager Maynard has
been asked to bring the first eleven to
Los Angeles, but in case this should be
impossible the second eleven may be
sent. This is, of course, provided that
it would bp, agreeable to the Los An
geles management.
For the second eleven a game has
been arranged at Sacramento on Nov
25, and one with the Oakland High
School to be played here. It is de
sired that everything shall be done to
encourage men to practice for the sec
ond eleven. If'a man will attend prac
tice regularly and show that he is in
earnest he will be put on the training
table, his suit will be furnished him,
and trips will be arranged for the sec
ond team, upon which all expenses will
le paid by the Athletic Association.
It will also be necessary to take a
number of substitutes along with the
first eleven on the Christmas trip and
also to the great game on Thanksgiving

day. These'substitutes will eujoy all
the privileges of members of the Var
sity team.
It is evident from these facts that it
is worth a man's while to put forth his
best efforts toward getting on the sec
ond eleven, and it is hoped that all per
sons who are ambitious in that direction
will come out to practice daily.
