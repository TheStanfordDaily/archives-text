# PROF GRIGGS'S LECTURE.
## The Ethics of Hamlet.
### 
A crowded chapel greeted the lec
turer of last evening, end the lecture
given was of much interest throughout.
The following is a brief sketch of the
subject matter:
Hamlet occupies a unique place in
the literature of the world. The Ores
teria of Aeschylus ends in the reconcil
iation of the ethical forces whose con
flict makes the 'drama, 'flic Divine
Comedy of Dante ends in the Beatific
Vision—a fitting crown to that pilgrim
age through hell and purgatory and
heaven to find a moral world. The
Faust of Goethe ends in the complete
regeneration of the soul whose life his
tory makes the drama. But it is not
so with llarulet. Here we have simply
the unanswered mystery that envelopes
all human life.
Shakspeie i* never a didactic moral
ist; yet he is a great revealer and inter
preter of human life. In the real
world we do not see the rounded whole
of human life. The threads of life are
spun but a little way, the Atropos cut*
them; and how these broken threads
are spun out in that "undiscovered
country from whose bourne no traveler
returns" no one can say. The poet
takes these broken threads of life and
spins them out into the finished cloth
of life. 11 is this that makes Shaks
pore's work so profoundly significant
ethically. He reveals the laws ruling
in human life. He shows how each
human being is ruled by the Fate that
is made up of his own finished or un
finished yesterdays,
Hamlet is exceptionally ethical
among Shakspere's dramas. The
whole working out of the drama is sitn
ply the unfolding of the spiritual con
dition in the chief character a f . the
begiuning. But. Hamlet is not alone
one tragedy If in Hamlet is the
tragedy of thought, in the king is the
tragedy of guilt; in the queeMhe'trag
edy of weakness; ij Ophelia, saddest of
all, the tragedy of fate or circumstances
A many-sided drama it is, and rt fleet
ing the real human world. Yet the
interest centres everywhere in Hamlet.
The main ethical problem is the prob
lem of Hamlet's life. He is brave, he
has an iron will, he can do deeds be
fore which the mere man of action
trembles. Yet he is utterly unable to
meet the problems of his life—to ex
press his soul in action. He is over
reflective, morbidly introspective, lie
is too finely moral to choose the course
of notion which to his intellectual con
viction is a plain duty. There is in
him a moral conflict between unconsci
ous moral instincts and intellectual con
viction. He cannot say with Drospero,
"The rarer action is in virtue than in
vengeanca-" He cannot kill the king.
So lie is swept down the stream of fate

carried to the inevitable fall. And so
it is in just this fate, blind or whose
rationality is beyond our ken, that
I lam let believes. Every man's faith is
made out of his life. And so Ilamlct
must conceive every event and every
action as the working out of a blind
destiny, and indeed, it is true. Every
great deed of his life comes from the
emotion of the moment and not from
rational choice, lie cannot put his own
life in a deed, hence he cannot believe
in spiritual reality. Then, too, every
one fails him. Only Horatio is true,
and he is a marvel. Hamlet puts on
an "antic disposition" to protect him
self from those about him. He plays
with them in words which to them are
meaningless but which inwardly express
the bitterest pessimism or the saddest
doubt.
The gloom steadily increases about
him. The black dream of existence
grows constantly blacker until the deed
is done that brings freedom just at the
moment when his own life goes out
into everlasting night. We seek to
pierce behind the impenetrable veil.
His life is one of those that compel us
to a belief in the existence of some an
swer to the craving of our hearts for
life, to the craving of our intellects for
a sane universe. But *in the drama
there is no answer And yet there is
in it something stupendous since it sim
ply presents that vast mystery which
will still last when all the minds that
have attempted an answer shall moulder
in the forgotten dust of buried ages.
