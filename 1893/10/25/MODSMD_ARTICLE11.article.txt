# Board at Encina.
## 
### 
The statement made in the Daily
Palo Alto yesterday that the price of
board in Encina will be reduced to
$12.50 per month, was not made on the
authority of its Managing Committee.
It is not possible to say at this time
what the price of board for November
will be. All the Committee can prom
ise now is that it will be as low as it
can be made, and it is hoped that it will
be less than for the present month.
