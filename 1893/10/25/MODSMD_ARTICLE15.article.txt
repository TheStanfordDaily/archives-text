Our military organization lias al
ready made wonderful progress and
promises soon to become an honor to
the University. When the military
band is at its head and its ranks are
swelled to a membership ot three hun
dred, we will all desire to be able to
march in one of the companies. The
mistakes made in the lirst few drills are
to be expected, and should in no way
be made a butt of ridicule. The action
of many of the spectators last night
was entirely discourteous, and deserves
the severest censure
