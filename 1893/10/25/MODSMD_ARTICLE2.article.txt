There was a big rush for Cable re
served seats this afternoon. The se
lection was somewhat scattered, how
ever, and those who have not yet se
cured seats may do so tomorrow, as they
will be sold at the registrars' office from
1.30 to 2:00 o'clock. No reserved
seats will be sold after tomorrow, so all
who intend going should get their
tickets at that time.
