# First Public Appearance of the Military Companies.
## 
### 
The military companies made thcil
initial nppearance yesterday afternoon
Considering the few times tliey have
drilled as companies tlicy acquitted
themselves very creditably. Only the
simple movements of the ''School of the
Company" were executed, but these
were performed with precision and good
order. Tbe whceling-by-fours was es
pecially good, and but for the slow cad
ence of the step, could not have been
improved upon. I'lie companies were
divided into squads and drilled by the
officers in some of the maruhing move
ments.
More drills promise to be a feature
of the University and will soon reflect
credit upon all concerned.
