# On the Gridiron Field.
## 
### 
The play last night was much better
than that of the evening before. The
men came out earlier and played a
more scientific game, especially in team
work aud in following the ball. The
men lined up more rapidly, tackled
harder, and showed a general improve
ment in tneir play. The line men,
especially the centre, entered more into
the game. One of the prettiest plays
on the field was made when McMillan
broke through and tackled the runner
behind the line. The end men of both
teams played a good game, breaking
through the interference fairly well,
tackling hard, and getting down the
field on a punt. Behind the line the
work was fair. The men started
quickly and interfered well, the block
ers knocking their men over.
One of the many results of coacher
Bliss's work is seen in the improvement
of the line bucking. The men run
low and strike haru, often worming
their way through where the rushers
have failed to make the opening. A
noticeable feature of this year's play in
contrast to that of last is the punting.
Regularly upon the third down, when
the necessary five yards have not been
made, the ball is kicked. Last evening
good kicks and returns were made by
both Kennedy and McKay.
A number of temporary changes have
been made in the line. Williams and
McMillan played guards for the Var
sity, while Burnett played centre, and
Thomas right guard, for the second
eleven.
