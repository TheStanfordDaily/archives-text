# THE 						TWO COACHES.
## Heffelfinger Visited Bliss Yesterday Geo. C. Carter of Seattle will be Asked to Umpire the Great Game. 
### 
C. C. Heffelfinger, Berkeley's foot
ball coach, was on the campus yester
day, the guest of "Pop" Bliss, with
whom he Ins played many a game on
the Yale team. He stayed all night
with Bliss and left for Berkeley this
morning.
In talking over the Berkeley team
he said they exhibited the same indif
ference and tardiness in coming out to
practice that characterizes our teams.
He has been playing on the- second
eleven two nights a week in order to
put more life into the game, but is now
devoting his whole attention to the first
eleven, and will probably not do any
more playing himself.
He has the team eating at a training
table which is conducted by Mrs. Ault
of Berkeley, but says the food provided
is not as good as our team receives.
The two coaches will not umpire and
referee the game on Thanksgiving Day,
as was done last year, and they are now
casting around for suitable men for the
purpose.
Geo. 0. Carter of Seattle will prob
ably be securcd to umpire. He is a
man who has an excellent knowledge of
the game, having played left guard ou
the Yale team for three years, and
since his graduation has been interested
in athletics to some extent in the north.
He was Ihffelfinger's predecessor for
the position of left guard on the Yale
team.
Bliss and Heffelfinger both feel sure
that he can be induced to come down
and umpire the game. The selection
of a referee, which is not such an im
portant position, will be made later.
