The students in Euiitia who habit
ually take possession of the bath rooms
at the very time when the football
players wish to occupy rhem should be
;i little more considerate, and should
bear in mind that immediately after
football practice there are about twenty
men who must take baths before dinner.

pied, by persons who leisurely pass
their time there, the football player
must stand rouud and wait.
