The election of members of the ex
ecutive committee of the Associated
Students still r«.*iuains undecided among
the nominees from the classes of '95
and '97. It is evident that no two of
several candidates can very eusily re
ceive a majority vote required by
the constitution. Hice 227, Cox 219,
Field 225, manifests a result in the
case of'9s which would not likely be
definitely changed by another ballot.
Luce 135, Thomas 209, O'Noil (j-i,
Morse 14"), Packard 1 1 o, manifests a
general tendency toward a general can
didate, but the second choice is in
doubt. The satisfactory arrangement
of this matter is the duty of the ox
ecutive committee that held office at
the time of the election. That execu
tive committee should see that the
present executive' committee is given
two representatives from both the j
junior and freshman classes.
In the existence of this difficulty, we!
a very good reason why the consti
tution should be amended so as to
obviate such a contingency which,

unless au amendment is made, is bound
to recur at every election. As matters
now stand, it would seem that the only
way tc do is I'>r pome of the nominees
to withdraw their names.
