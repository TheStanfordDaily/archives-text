# What Other People Think About Geo. W. Cable.

### 
Mr. Cubic, who will appear in the
chapel Friday evening, i just finishing
a tour through the northern and western
states. In speaking of the celebrated
novelist, after a very successful appear
ance in >St. Paul, the Pioneer Press says:
It was a thoroughly delighted audi
ence which filled the larjje and hand
some auditorium of the Congregational
church last evening; a good index of
the trrip George VV, Cable has upon
popular esteem. Mr Cable's not parti
cularly stately proportions loomed up
from the rostrum for all they were
wonh. He looked considerably older
than when he was ho e a lew years ago,
when lie sandwiched himself in between
inrge slices of Mark Twain at. the Grand
Opera llouac. The peculiar and Cable
like manifestation above his upper lip
was not visible. His odd chirpy voice
has undergone no specii! change. His

reading last niglit was much more fin
ished and effective than it was; indeed,
highly dramatic at the climaxes, which
are not infrequent in the story of
" Grandissimes," the most of which was
given. Starting out just a little tamely,
he tired up as he went along, and roused
the audience from comparative coolness
to a high pitch of enthusiasm. His
depiction of the scenes and sounds in
the school-room on that eventful day
was worthy of the stage for vividness
and power. The vein of humor in the
narrative was finely brought out, and
caused constant outbursts. The pecu
liar brogue, so accurately accentuated,
enhanced greatly the charm of the
thing. Mr. Cable was not hampered
by having to refresh his memory by
reference to the text, and skipped about
the platform like a kitten. For over
two hours he held the undivided atten
tion of the audience. The Young
Men's Lecture Course was most auspi
ciously opened by last night's signal
success.
Mr. Cable is a personal friend of Dr.
Jordan's, and is highly recommended
by hitu.
