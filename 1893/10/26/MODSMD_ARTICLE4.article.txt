It seems as if our boys could never
play a good practice two nights in suc
cession. The men seemed to lose all
the results of their previous work before
such a judge of football as Heffelfinger.
While playing a medium individual
game they lost all ideas of team work.
The playing was slow, the men lining
up at their will. There was a decided
lack of that vim and dash that charac
terized the playing of last week. The
men were slow in breaking through on
a kick, and even then failed to follow
the ball. The 1 ine men allowed their
opponents to break through with appar
ent ease and stop the play before it was
well started. When tackling they
caught their man around the neck and
allowed the runners to stagger on for
gains.
There remain but five weeks before
the great game, and it appears as though
our boys are not yet ready to settle
down to hard conscientious work. We
have among us some fine individual
players, but must bear in mind that
they can not win a game for us by their
work alone. Every man has a part to
do in every play, 'and unless he does
his share, the object of the play will be
frustrated. Yale, though not having
such line individual players as Harvard,
wins by her team work.
In the absence of Walton and Lewis,
Frankenheitner and Harrelson played
the halves for the varsity. Franken
heitner played his usual good game,
bucking the line fairly well and making
some good runs round the end. Walton
is Dirain troubled with his riirbt, ankle
and has laid oil' lor a few days. White
house has almost recovered from his in
jured knee.
