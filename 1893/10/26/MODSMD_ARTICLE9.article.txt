### 
The ladies of the Mayfield Methodist
Church are about to organize an
aid society, the aim of which is to
assist in paying the running expenses
of the church. The society is ready to
make good bed comforters, also plain
garments of any kind. Mrs. Thomp
son, Lincoln street, Mayfield, will be
glad to receive all orders.
