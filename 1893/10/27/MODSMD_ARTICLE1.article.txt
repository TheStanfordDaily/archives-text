# THE 						GRANDISSIMES.
## Synopsis of the Story to be Read by Cable Tonight. 
### 
"The Grandissimes" is the earliest of
Mr. Cable's sustained covels, and is a
portrayal of the Creole civibzation; of
of the peculiar functions of it, which in
many eases largely exist, but were in
their full strength and purity in the
beginning of the present century.
The time of the story is the period
of the cession of Louisiana by Napo
leon to the United States 1803-4. The
story tells of one .Joseph Frowenfeld,
a German-American from the north,
coming to Louisiana, losing his father,
mother, and sisters by yellow fever, but
recovering from the fever himself under
the medical care of Dr. Keene and the
nursing of a young Creole girl of high
family, whose presence was unknown to
him, owing to his delirium. Hr. Keene
made him acquainted with he r after
his sickness, and with her mother, only
sixteen years her senior and equally
charming and beautiful.
Dr. Keene loved the daughter and
bye-and-bye feared that Frowenfeld
would love and court her more success
fully than himself. These two ladies,
the widow Nancanon and her daughter,
were the last representatives of their
proud family, and were supposed to
hold an invincible antipathy to the
Grandissime family, of which Agricola
Fusilier was the venerable and auto
cratic uncle. Agricola had gambled
with the young husband of Aurora
Nancanon, and in the desperation of
the game had staked and lost his entire
estate. lie had thereupon accused
Agricola of cheating at cards, accepted
his challenge and fallen in the duel.
Ilouore Grandissimi, young, accom
plished, talented, fell in love with Au
rora Nancanon at a masked ball, and in
the end restored to her the entire value
of the estate won by Agricola at cards;
and iu turn won her heart, affections,
and her hand upon her discovering that
before even having met her he had, from
the first, kept the account of the
estate separate, with the fixed deter
mination to make the restitution when
ever the way opened for so doing.
Frowenfeld married Clotilde, the daugh
ter. The motif of the story is the first
conflict between Creole civiliza
tion and the Anglo-Saxon civilization,
into which it was the first time brought
into unavoidable contact and competi
tion, when Louisiana became a part of
the territory of the United States.
