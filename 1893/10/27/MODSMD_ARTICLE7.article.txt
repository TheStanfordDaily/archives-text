Trie practice last night was a succes
sion of tumbles and poor plays. The
halves frequently dropped the ball and
did not obey their signals. The men
still continue to make their high tackles,
and neglect to follow the ball as they
should. The whole practice was played
with a lack of vim and spirit. The
only redeeming feature was the work of
the Varsity centre, who played an ex
ceptionally good game. But for the
dangerous habit of getting offside Bur
nett, Downing, and McMillan must be
commended for the admirable manner
in which they broke through and
downed their men behind the line. The
second team, taking advantage of the
fumbles of the Varsity, was able, near
the close of the practicc, to force the
ball down within fifteen yards of the
Varsity's goal, but missed on trial fora
goal and the ball wentinto touch.
