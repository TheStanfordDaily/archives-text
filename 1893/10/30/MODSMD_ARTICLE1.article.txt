II 0. Turner, Mgr. '1)7 fool ball team.
Dear Sir: â€”In accordance with your
request of September 28 to play a
game of football between our teams
in San Francisco, I enclose this chal
lenge:
The football team of the class of '07,
University of California, hereby chal
lenges the football team of the class of
'!)7, Leland Stanford Junior Uuiversity,
to a tratne of football to be played in
San Francisco within two weeks after
Thanksgiving day, 189;}.
J. H. Bishop, Mgr.,
Frank Taylor, Capt.
We have received a request that
this game be played for the bene
fit of the Mid-Winter Fair, that
organization to guarantee expenses and
make some concessions to the players
in the way of passes, etc. \Ve think
that the cause is a good one and are
willing to devote our share of the re
ceipts to it on those conditions. By
making them our beneficiaries we in
mediately enlist in our cause the four
most powerful papers of San Francisco,
whose advertising would develop an
interest in our class game impossible
otherwise to attain after the great inter
c>l legiate excitement. The committee
of thu fair having this matter in charge
wish some definite information immed
iately so that they can arrange for
grounds. Sincerely yours,
J. M. Bishop, Mgr '97 teun.
Berkeley, October 29.
