Cackling aud giggling were heard
continually throughout Friday evening's
entertainment from some person seated
right in the front row. It was sug
gested that it issued from a hired leader
of the applause who mistook the
all through the eveuing and conse
quently vented approval at the wrong
time. Such extravagant conduct as
this is absurd and unworthy of any
consideration but passing contempt, had
it not been that many of the fiuest
passages of the evening's recital were
completely spoiled for all the audience.

Intellectual self-reliance despises
the use of the word toleration. It
demands for itself the right to think
and to express the thought, at the same
time deuying to others the privilege
of saying that they will allow, or that
they will permit, this expression. The
use of this word gives the impression
that those who use it have the power
to proscribe and suppress the thought,
but that it is inexpedient to do so.
Recognizing this dislike of all comment
upon expression of thought which may
seem to indicate sufferance rather than
criticism, it is found very difficult to
make some needful notes on the thought
expressed and the experiences related
at some of the Sunday evening services.
These meetings are taken by strangers
to represent and express the thought
of the University on the subjects
bandied. This being the case it is im
perative that they do not be allowed to
degenerate into an exchange of trifling
personals, uninteresting, stale, value
less to visitors, and destructive of the
strength which comes from earnest and
sincere thought upon any subject, no
matter how occult. It is a libel upon
the quality of the work done here when
one can rise in the meeting and say
that it gives him pleasure to be able to
testify to the fact that the whole of bis
studies at the University have not
tended to change the opinions which he
had on entering upon his work here,
and that, he is sure all others will find
the effect to be the same.
The eneonragem jnt and support
which visitors giin from the choral
service is invariably destroyed by the
stupid egoism of those who rise and
talk irrelevantly fora moment and then
fall back for subject matter upon their

own good intentions, their own ambi
tions, their own besetting sin. Great
help is obtained by all from the mus
ical part of the service, and it .is hoped
that it will become a still more promi
nent element in the program of the
evening.
