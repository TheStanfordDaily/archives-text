### 
There were two eaglets born high up
in the mountains. Their home was a
pile of sticks upon the verge of a deep
precipice. Their proteeior and pro
vider was the mother eagle. For
long time that parent's care shielded
their life from every danger and hard
ship, and represented an all powerful
arid all providing love. One day the
mother eagle, after a long absence, re
turned without the food the little
eaglets expected; more, she broke up
and scattered the pile of sticks which
had been their home and their world.
While the eaglets were dumbly watch
ing and wondering, bewildered by this
change in the tender mother, she ap
proached and pushed them over the
brink of the cliff. Down they fluttered,
beating tho air vainly with weak and
untried wings, and were almost dashed
against the bottom of the chasm when
the mother's great form swooped be
neath them and they alighted safely
upon her broad body. Up she carried
them, and again she urged them over
the edge. The sense that she would
rescue them before they reached the
rocky depth gave them confidence and
murage in learning to fly
God could have created the eagle
witli fully developed wings, but ho
wished them to earn and learn for
themselves, lie can create a perfect

man, but he wishes man to develop
and grow strong and noble by his own
efforts. Every hardship in lite is an
opportunity to make oursclf greater.
Only in bearing and overcoming these
hardships can we shape ourselves into
what we would be.
