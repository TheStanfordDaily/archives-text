# The 						Recital by Geo. W. Cable.
## 
### 
On account of the energy shown by
the football management in booming
and advertising the reading by G. W.
Cable for Friday evening the attendance
was a remarkably good one. The rep
utation of Mr. Cable as an author and
public speaker had preceded him and
caused more to be looked for in him
than could reasonably be expected.
Prof. Stillman introduced him and he
commenced in a thin voice by paying a
tribute to our buildings and to the
Daily.
llid reading for the eveniug was
taken from ''The Grandissitnes," a
story of Creole life. Undoubtedly the
work is far better suited for personal
perusal than for public recital. A
novel suitable for iapid reading, or for
the dull hour before bedtime, is calcu
lated to impress a public gathering by
its subject matter alone. On this ac
count, perhaps, Mr. Cable is to be
congratulated on his ability in render
ing the recital so intensely interesting
by his- presentation of the characters
and events in *so real a way. The re
cital was concluded by the singing of
two pretty Creole ditties, in a voice and
with an expression that did him great
c.edit, and wlr'ch were received with
great favor by the audience.
