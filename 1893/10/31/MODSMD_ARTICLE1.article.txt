# An Interview with Heffelfinger.
## 
### 
Mr. Heffelfinger, the big coach of
the U. 0. team, was accosted by a
Palo Alto reporter last week, and ou
being asked what he thought of western
football, said that he was greatly sur
prised to find the game so far advanced.
The one great difference, however, be
tween eastern and western football is
remarkably evident in the kicking and
punting. In the east a good deal of
time is devoted to these, and conse
quently we lind full-backs who seldom
make a bad punt, or miss a goal. In
the west it is different; the punting
and kicking is poor —it. could hardly be
poorer. Football in the west will never
equal the game in the east. There are
not enough preparatory schools, the
training school of the football player.
A good football player must have it
born in liini, and it requires practice to
bring out a mun's good qualities. The
preparatory schools of the east serve
this purpose Then there is another
disadvantage in the west; a team
cannot get the practice necessary to
insure success. Athletic clubs can
supply this in part, as beiuy better than
nothing, but there is not the enthusi
asm shown in this kind of game that
there is in contests between rival col
leges.
Mr. Bliss, Mr. Norton, aud myself
think of getting up a team as a prac
tice eleven for the two universities.
Next Wednesday we intend to play
Berkeley at Central Park, and on the
following Wednesday, with Stanford.
We will give both universities all they
can do to handle us, provided our wiud
stays with us.
Some, of the players in the Berkeley
team arc showing up well. Kansome,
Hunt, and Humphreys are our strong
est men. From what 1 can judge of
Wednesday's practice at Stanford, Cap
tain Wilson seems to be a strong man,
Code is an excellent interferer, and
Kennedy did the best punting I have
seen on the coast.
What do I think of Yale's chances
this year? Yale was never so weak be
hind the line. In the line they are as
heavy as any other college team with
the exception of the University of
Pennsylvania. Harvard's chances for
the championship are very good.
