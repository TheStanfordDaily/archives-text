Confidence in our abilities should
he in every person's mind. Especially
should this be so in athletics. Hut
there is such a thing as over confidence,
a spirit which we think is entirely too
common at present in both players and
adherents of football. From last Sat
urday's game at Central Park between
the U. (J. and the Reliance team of
Oakland, it is evident to all that lierkeley
has a strong team, certainly stronger
than their previous elevens, if not than
any other team on the coast. In quick
ness and in interference they are by
far the best. Unless we make good
use of the remaining time, it is almost
a foregone conclusion that the U. C.
colors will tluat triumphant over the
hitherto unconquered standard of Palo
Alto.
Our football men shou'd be alive to
this fact and should fill up the few
weeks remaining before the great game
in hard earnest work. They should
realize the great importance of the
game to the University. A victory
means a great deal for our beloved in
stitution, and nothing should be left
undone which will go to insure our
success. We have football material
which in many points cannot be sur
passed. What we want is more foot
ball enthusiasm among the candidates
for positions upon the eleven, as well as
among the students at large. Let every
player feel that a large share of the
work to be done on Thanksgiving day
will have to be done by himself.
The management is doing everything
in its power to insure success, but un
less it receives the hearty co operation
of the students and enthusiastic work
on the part of the players, their efforts
will be in vain. We must buckle on
our armor and enter into the game with
a new spirit. Let everyone get down
to work at once, resolved to uphold our
standard; and then, and not till then,
can we feel confident or safe of the final
issue.
