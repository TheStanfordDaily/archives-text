The presumption is that the steward
in Eneina Hall makes some provision

nor is it supposed to be the proper place
to leave grape-skijs and stems. The
stairway and lobby is certainly an ad
mirable place to throw such things,
and the taste of the persons using these
places as rubbish receptacles is greatly
to be commended and deserves to be
imitated by every one who comes from
the country to the university to obtain
culture.
