# Sigma Nu Fiji Game Postponed.
## 
### 
By the mutual consent of Downing
and Cochran, the captains respectively
of the Sigma Nu and Fiji elevens, the
tranie scheduled for tomorrow afternoon
has been pos'poned until after Thanks
giving day. This action was taken
â€¢i ft or consultation with Captain Wilson,
who considers that anv such games,
coming as they necessarily would in
the afternoon, would eontliet with the
regular practice of the Varsity eleven;
for some players in both the fraternity

teams would have to play two games in
one afternoon. For the same reason no
Saturday game could be arranged.
