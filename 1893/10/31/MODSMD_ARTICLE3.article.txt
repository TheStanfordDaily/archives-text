# U. C. versus Reliance Football.
## 
### 
The football game at Central Park
between the Reliance athletic team and
the University of California was an im
portant, one to Stanford, inasmuch as it
was the first opportunity offered to
judge of the strength of the team which
is to meet Stanford on the oOtli of
November.
The game was a walk-over for the
Berkeley eleven and was a failure in
the eyes of an uninterested spectator.
The Reliance team was made up of big,
heavy men, who outweighed their op
ponents at every position, but on
account of their ignorance of the game
and their slowness in getting into line
the light but well-trained team from
the foothills out-played them at every
point. In the first part of the game
llansome and Humphreys made two
touchdowns in quick succession, almost
before the Reliance team were aware
that the ball had been snapped. In
this half Berkeley scored four touch
downs and one goal, due to the excel
lent work of Humphreys, llansome,
Burr, and Hunt, aided by the superb
interference of the entire LI. C. team.
The second half was taken up mainly
by the individual playing of the above
four men, whose main line of playin«r
was bucking the line. Two touchdowns
were scored in the second half, making
the score 80 to 0 iri favor of U. C.
