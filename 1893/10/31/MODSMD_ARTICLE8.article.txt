The Chronicle spoke in the follow
ing terms of the company's performance:
The German play lust night was one
of the most amusing of farces on the
•'Art Bacilus," otherwise, the stage
struck people. The house was again
very large and the .piece, admirably
played by Mr. Thomas and Miss Dam
hofer in the leading parts, and with the
smaller parts excellently rendered by
Mr. Hitzigrath's company, went with
continuous movement.
There has been a fairly good sale of
