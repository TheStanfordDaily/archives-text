## Another Unrivalled Musical ,Organization. It Will Make its First Appearance This Evening. 
### 
Abreast v.ith the progress in ath*
letics and literary affairs have been the
musical organizations of Stanford
"While the men upon the football field
and the cinder track have been training
hard in order to) uphold the athletic
reputation of the University; while the
Glee Club and the Band have been en
gaged in winning fresh laurels; the
Mandolin Club, by laboring 1 >ng and
hard in comparative obscurity, has
reached a degree of perfection uuat
tained by an other amateur organiza
tion on the Coast
It consists of nine members, distri
buted as follows: Wells, '9(3, leader, and
Code, '95, first mandolins; Kessinger,
'95, and Kaufman, '96, second uiaudo
lius; Harris, '90, flute; Tregea, '90,
Wilson, '96, and Wolff, '97, guitars;
Young, '95, cello.
The club plays sixteen selections
which have been arranged especially
for it by the most eminent composer in
San Francisco. At preseut negotia
tions are being carried on to place the
club under the auspices of the athletic
association, and to accompany the foot
ball team in its tour north.
The club has appeared but once in
public, the r ffair being only an experi
ment, as the club had just organized.
This evening it will appear at the
German play in the chapel* with music
especially arranged for the occasion.
In the near future it is to give a con
cert either in San Jose or Redwood.
Every member of the club is enthusias
tic over its welfare. Leader Wells,
who was East last year, says the club
is in better condition and has greater
ability than any similar organization
with which he is acquainted
