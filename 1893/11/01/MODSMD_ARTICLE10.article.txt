Few of us in the University appre
ciate the benefit obtained from thesis
work in history or other branches of
study. The gain derived from original
work in the library is real and immed
iate. Not only does one become famil
iar with sources, but he obtains a know
ledge of reference books in general
which is invaluable to him as a student.
No part of a student's work is more in
teresting, if the subject be entered into
with a will; and no other work, perhaps,
is more beneficial in all respects.
