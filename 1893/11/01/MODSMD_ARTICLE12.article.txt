"All candidates for first degrees in
'93 and '94 arc requested to look over
their records in the registrar's office
sometime during the week."
The preceding notice to the graduat
ing class, and to all working fora de
gree, is a word in season and should be
closely heeded. The members of last
spring's class were bright and shining
examples of students who did not look
up their records till the last moment, and,
then, generally found them waiting.
Those who were not in fear and trem
bling as to the results of a perusal of
their records were a decided minority.
Some, even who perhaps might have
graduated, went home without their pre
cious sheep-skins on account of negli
gence in looking lip their standing early
in the year. The timely notice of the
registrar should prevent any such diffi
culty from arising among the members
of the present class.
