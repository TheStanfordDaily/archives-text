# Lady Students Boycotted at Wesleyan
## 
### 
When Wesleyan University first
opened its doors to young ladies there
â€¢was no opposition among the young

men. The young ladies, however, have
so increased in numbers that the boys
begin to feel their influence in college
affairs, the effect of which is the decline
of football.
The first evidence of the feeling of
the boys was the name "quail" which
signifies a female student at Wesleyan.
Webb Hall, the dormitory of the young
adies, is known as "Quail Koost." But
this is not all. The boys have organ
ized the "P. D. Q." society, the object
of which is to ''put down" the "quails,"
'p. d. q." The society is secret and
has now only about 100 members, but
every young man is expected to join-
The method adopted by the "P. J).
Q." society is similar to the. boycott.
The college girls will not be invited by
the co'lege boys to any entertainments.
Any college boy seen in company with
a "quail" will be summarily treated.
The "quails" are to receive no consider
ation whatever.
