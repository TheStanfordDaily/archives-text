There are over seventy-five men at
present training for the Harvard track
team.
The faculty of the Princeton semin
ary has decided that students in that
dep rtment shall not be allowed to play
football. The reason given is that the
game is beneath the dignity of divinity
students.
Dr. 11. T. Ely has preseuted to the
Wisconsin State Historical Library his
valuable collection of files of American
and European labor journals, which he
has been engaged in accunnnulating for
several years.
According to insiders Princeton's
best line is made up as follows: Mc-
Cauley, left end; Holly, left tackle;
Wheeler, left guard; Baliet, centre;
Hall, right guard; Lea, right tackle;
aud Trenchard, right end.
Harvard is in ueed of men for the
middle of the line. For centre the ro
table L .wis is at hand. M ckie, one
of l"st year's guards, will fill the same
position this year. For the other guard
no good material is ready. For posi
tions behind the line there are numer
ous candidate', especially for quarter
back. Gray, of last year's team, will
play half-back, and B.ewer will be at
his old petition as full-back.
Beginning this year a most important
regulation relative to the degree of
bachelor of arts goes into effect at Har
vard. To be recommended for the
degree of bathelor of arts a student
must not only have pussed in all pre
scribed studies and in the requisite
number of elective courses, but he
also have stood above grade I) in at
lerst of his college work,
and also in at least one-half of
the work of his senior year.
