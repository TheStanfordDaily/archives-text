# PROF. PERRINE'S LECTURE.
## An Inside View of a College Settlement. 
### 
A crowded house listened .attentively
last evening to Prof. Pcrrine's first
lecture The subject was new and very
interesting to all the students, and the
speaker was frequently applauded. The
substance of the lecture is as follows:
At the time Ingram eulogized Arnold
Toynbee in his article i?i the i'incycl«
pedia Britannicn, a group of English
men were founding Toynbee hall in the
White Chapel region of London; a
memorial to test his methods of study
and solution of the complex prob
lems of social life. From Toynbee hall

au influence has gone out that caused
the founding of many so-called univer
sity settlements in American cities.
Last year I became closely identified
with the work of £ ndover house, at
Buston, one such descendant of
Toyubee hall, and it is chiefly of
the work of this settlement I wish to
speak. This house may be called a
sociological laboratory, as the greater
part of the work in. that settlement has
always been a study of the forces of the
sorroundings, together with an attempt
to make use of such tendencies for
elev iting the people as might be found
to exist there. The house was founded
by the president of Dartmouth College,
though the success of its work is especi
ally due to Robert A. Woods, a former
resident of Toynbee hall, who has been
admirably adapted to the difficult task
of cementing into one whole the hetero
geneous community of inmates and
assistants, for, although interested in
the general purpose of work, and in
accordance with its aims and methods,
there was little to keep them in har
ino y. The house had seven inmates
when I entered, but was assisted to a
large extent by outsiders who were
interested in the work
The situation was in the Bowery of
Boston. All around us were tenements
aud lodgings with their accompanying
saloons and dives, which furnished
problems enough fur the most hungry
student of municipal life in its many
phases.
The work was divided into two sec
tions. Each man was assigned to his
own especial study, but all united in
the practical side, which we called the
institutional work. Of the latter, the
essential feature consisted in a boys'
club of about one hundred
ranging from eight to fifteen years, of
whom three sections were made accord
ing to age. Wo taught them carpentry,
gave military drills, performed scientific
experiments, and both taught and
learned many things. Gradually it
became evident that we must depart as
far as possible from the traditions of the
school-room, or some young spirit like
"Mickey Oates, the Pie Alley Detec
tive" would create so much disorder as
to necessitate school-room methods.
Some of the young girls of the neigh
borhood were taught sewing and house
keeping, quite a contrast to the fights
iji which they often participated.
Besides this, a group of young men
who discussed the political news of the
day, a kindergarten, a kitchen garden
class, and many other similar organiza
tions, were founded by the house. At
the same time, each man was enrrying
on some special line ot investigation in
the social problems of the city, and
besides their special studies, the mem
bers were connected with Ml the public
movements throughout the city for
municipal social reform.
