# Hallowe'en.
## 
### 
The boys were out last night. As a
result things about the towns were
slightly mixed up. This morning at
Palo Alto a wagon was found upon the
roof of the station. At Mayfield the
watch-maker's sign swung from the top
of the high flagpole. Gates were lifted
off their hinges and movable article!
piled up in front of the stores. The
climax was capped, however, by fixing
the Y. M. C. A. sign on the front of
Patsy Green's Sporting Palace.
