# The 						German Play a Success.

### 
01' the large assortment already pre
sented in the chapel, perhaps the most
novel entertainment was the perform
ance last evening by the German Com
edy Company of San Francisco. This
company is in many ways first-class,
and considering the very meagre facili
ties which the chapel afforded, their
work last evening deserves high praise.
The program was made up especially
for their Stanford audience, and the
company was evidently not so thorough
ly at home in the classic pieces as in
the bright little farce given at the
close. The San Francisco German play
goers have not doue much tc encourage
the playing of the great tragedies, and
the Baldwin company doubtless had to
go back to more or less distantcxperience
when they were asked to give us "Iphi
genie and Egmout." For this reason,
pirtly, the prompting was continuous
This is, however, customary in the
German theatres where runs of a hun
dred nights or more are, unknown, and
the bill is regularly changed each night,
and in a larger auditorium it would not
have been noticed.
Fred Uitzigrath, who manages the
company, has been a famous "Egmont"
in Germany, and his spleudid voice and
figure were shown to good advantage in
the two selections from "Egmont."
Hermann Raberg, who did the most
work of all, was a little too loud aud
impetuous as "Alba" and as "Thoas,"
but in the scene from "Faust" no bet
ter " Mcphistopheles" could be asked
for by anyone. The "Schuler" of
Herman Wagner, in the same scene,
was excellent also.
Frl. Louise Sehmid gave pleasure
to all by her reading of -'Iphigenie."
During part of the scene she threw,
perhaps, too much passion into her re
cital, but Frl. Schmid is not a tragic;
she is a comedienne and her versatility
is admirable.
Two members of the company, Ilerr
Walther and Frl. Gartner, sang pleas
antly between scenes, Frl. Gartner
winuing much applause for her ex
pressive face and her success in mak
in much of her songs intelligible to all.
In "Hohe Gaeste," the concluding
piece, :lie company were in their ele
ment and did some delightful acting.
Emil Thomas, an excellent comedian,
appeared in the farce. His fame is
considerable and his audience were not
disappointed.
Fr! Hetty Danihofer, the "star"
proper, was alone worth going to see.
Her humor and vivacity are tine and it
is to t»e regretted that she had not a
better place in which to act for us. It
is to be hoped that if such a company
visits the University again .more pre
paration will be made for their com
ing. Frl. Pamhofer's two songs were
appreciated as her tine voicc and train
i'i_' deserved

Of our home talent, the'jopening trio
with Prol. Goebel ut the piano, and
C. C. Thomas and C. Magee with
violin and cello, was well reudered.
The Mandolin Club made its first
formal appearance and played excel
lently.
