Tim students have shown their ap
preciation of good attractions by their
patrouage of Kiddle. Cable, and Thomas
during the past three weeks, it is
hoped that the standard of excellence
on the part of the entertainers will con
tinue to merit such crowded houses.
The general run of the entertainments
given in the chapel last year was decid
edly amateu r ish, and care should be
taken that no such fakes be allowed in
the future.

Last evening's entertainment given
by the Thomas German Opera Com
pany was a treat long to be remembered
by those who attended. The acting
was high class throughout and, to those
who were familiar witli tlie German
language, was also instructive. W ith
our footlights and cramped by a decid
edly diminutive stage, the coiupan) of
thirteen stars gave an entertainment far
superior to anything hitherto attempted
in the chapel.
To Prof. Goebel belongs the credit of
securing a date for this high class com
pany.
