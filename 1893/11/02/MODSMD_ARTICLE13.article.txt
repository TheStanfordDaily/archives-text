# Souvenir of Yale-Princeton Game.
## 
### 
The official program of the Vale-
Princeton football game at Now York
on Thanksgiving day will s.)on appear.
The design is a novel one, aud has been
copyrighted by a well-known Now York
printing house, who will use it as an
illustration aud advertisement of finc
work in the printer's art. It is oval in
shape, about ten inches long by seven
wide, having the appearance of a
fljtiened football, as the covers are
made of leather the cxact color of pig
skin, and having the usual seam run
ning through them lengthwise, which
makes the resemblance to a genuine
football very striking. The covers are
also lijeed together at the back with a
leather theng, exactly like that used to
lace a football, and on the front cover
appeais, in gold letters,"Yale vs
Princeton." The body of this souvenir
will be no less attractive, containing
some sixty pages of line coated paper,
each page ornatneuU'd with a neat mar
ginal design, and every third or fourth
page given up to excellent half-tone
illustrations of the various athletic
teams of Harvard, Princeton and Yale,
as well as pictures of men who have J

attained especial prominance in athletic
sports. The publishers will issue ten
thousand copies and estimate the cost,
in this quantity at about forty ceuts
each. The programs will, however, be
sold for twenty five cents, the difference
being paid by the advertisements. The
program will form a very handsome
and appropriate souvenir of the Thanks
giving day game. â€” Yale Neics.
