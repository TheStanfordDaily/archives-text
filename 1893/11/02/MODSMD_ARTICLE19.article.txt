# Palo Alto Notes.
## 
### 
All are invited to attend the informal
reception, Friday evening, Nov. 3, at
Lirio Hall, to be given by the Ladies'
Guild.
Palo Alto is decidedly opposed to
Chinese OLCupation . A few days ago a
Chinaman secured the lease of a house
in the business part cf town for five
years with the intention of opening a
laundry. Several of the citizens talked
with the Chinaman, telling him he was
not wanted, that he would not be per
mitted to go into business hero. Fin
ally, fora uiouey considerations, he was
induced to relinquish his lease and leave
the place.
