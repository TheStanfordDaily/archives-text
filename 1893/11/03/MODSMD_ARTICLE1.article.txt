Something over fifty dollars, has al
ready been subscribed for the benefit of
the Midwinter Fair, and as yet only a
hundred students have been asked.
Dr. Branner, of the Midwinter Fair
Committee has endorsed the movement
by placing his name at the head of the
faculty list. The usual amount sub
scribed by each studeut is twenty-five
cents, and by the faculty members fifty
cents, although some have given more.
Those who have the matter in charge
are Miss Mary E. Burke, Franklin V.
Brooks, and J. Tarn McGiew. The
subscription list will be published in
the Daily Palo Alto next week.
