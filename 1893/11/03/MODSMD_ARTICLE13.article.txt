A college publication owes its first
duty to the college which it represents,
and on no account should it neglect to
look after the best interests of the local
college community. Hut while this is
true, it is equa'ly true that there should
be no antagonism shown toward any
other institution of learning, whether
great or small, near or remote. It
should be the object of every college
paper to advance the cause of education
throughout the land, and this can only
be done by co-operatiug one with
another by aiding and encouraging
every worthy movement which tends
toward that end. There should be a
common feeling among college news
papers which would discountenance any
report or junior, the end of which is to
injure the reputation of a sister college.
It should not be their policy to scatter
broadcast every little bit of sensational
college news which the public press
dishes up for its readers. It should be
their duty to protect and to defend
any college when it is assailed. No
distinction should be made; petty rival
ries should drop from consideration. It
should only be remembered that col
leges have a common purpose and that
anything tending to injure oue tends to
injure all. A sensational report con
corning hazing at Princeton, injures not
only Princeton, but puts a discount
upon colleges in general. The pape r
which publishes an item concerning the
financial ding of some college, gains
nothing for the college which it repre
sents, but it may do incalculable injury
to the institution involved. A greater
spirit of liberality should be shown by
college newspapers. We are many of
us too narrow and selfish, and until we
get r>d of this spirit, the progress of
education will be seriously hampered.
