We should have a students' aid so
ciety at Stanford. Few colleges < r
universities offer to students such op
portunities for self-help as Stanford.
For this very reason we have many
eminently worthy students who have
come here with the expectation of earn
ing all or a part of their expenses, either
at the University, or during their sum
mer vacations. M my of these stu
dents have heen employed as clerks,
agents, bookkeepers, stenographers, cte ,

and arc qualified to fill positions of
trust. When the summer vacation
comes round, these men will be in
seirch of employment. At the same
time many persons and firms will bo in
need of efficient help, and the society
could do a splendid work in bringing
these two classes of persons together.
The venture has been a success at
nearly every college of prominence in
this country. When it is kuown that
there is such an organization in a col
lege, persons in need of help will com
municate with it and thus congenial
and lucrative employment might be
secured for those students who desire
it. Here is a chance for an enterpris
ing student to do good work and it is to
be hoped that the necessary enterprise
will not be warning.
