Practice fur the last three days lias
been marked with plenty of life and a
great deal of brilliant individual play
ing. The varsity is, to use a common
expression, playing in luck in having
such a good team to play against in the
daily practice. Probably Stanford's
second eleven, as a practice team, is
the strongest and best team that could
be found on the coast. Berkeley has
no such second eleven, and if daily prac
tice counts for an) thing, the varsity
should be in better shape by Nov. 80
than their rivals from the hills.
Tuesday Leadbetter made the first
touch-down of the season for the second
eleven. Walton was running with the
ball and as he was passing, Leadbetter
snatched the ball from him and made
for the opposite go
Walton and Fratikenheimer have
been playing the halves, and the two
are working well together Downing
and McMillan are the Lest men in the
line. Cochran is at his best, and his
playiug cannot be commented upon.
Jo. Field appeared ou the field Wed
nesday, and was placea opposite Claude
Downing, who played in Whitehouse's
place. Field was one of the most prom
ising men last year, but on account of
sickness has been out of condition since
the beginning of the semester.
Yesterday the best team work
was shown that has been displayed this
semester. The playing generally was
characterized by more vim and energy
than any hitherto noticed.
Taking the varsity team as a whole,
they are playing a much better game
than ever before. Slowness in putting
the ball into play seems to be their only
great fault, at present. Unless they
play (juickly they cannot be expeeted to
| day a successful game a uinst Ber
keley.
