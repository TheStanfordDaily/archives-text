# DOWN GO THE OLYMPICS
## The 						Varsity Wins the Big Game by the Score of 40 to 0. 
### 
The Game Characterized by Individual
Playing.
About one hundred and fifty enthus
iasts accompanied the team to the city
Saturday to see the first big game
of the season. The Olympics played in
the old time form, but Saturday's game
demonstrated the fact that the suprem
acy of the athletic clubs on this coast in
football matters is at an end.
The game was exciting throughout.
Stanford did not win with such ease
as the score might lead one to believe
Every man played ball from start to
finish, and if he had not, the result
would have been far different, "x be
Olympics played a plucky game, and
since the weeding out of several of their
old players—Biekets, Brewer, and the
like—have adop'.ed a fairer and more
gentlemanly style of play.
The game Saturday proved that Stan
ford is no longer crippled by a weak
line. Time and again, as the brawny
Olympic men bucked up against them,
the linemen forced them back with
comparative ease In the center, P.
Downing, Burnett, and McMillan each
played a star game, and tcre up the op
posing line with impunity. These
three men put up the steadiest game
of the day. CoJiran and Whireho isc
made phenomenal runs from their posi
tions at tackles. Tneir offensive work
was exceedingly good at all times, but
several times they evidenced weakness
in defensive play. Their evident fault
is their eagerness to break through, and
they thus weakeu a thoroughly defens
ive line. At left end, (J. Downing did
not do much to be noticed in the first
half, but in the second half he put up
a game which set the cranks wild.
He made hard tackles repeatedly, and
by quick interference with the ball
caused a safety to be scored against the
Olympics. Wilson was n.»t given a
chance to star, but pulled down every
man who tried to circle right end, and
he also broke through interference well.
Codj pl.iyed "nis usual cool-headed irame
at quarter. lie used much better
judgment in giving the signals than
last year, and showed a marked improve
ment in his all-round playing. Walton
and Lewis played strong individual
sanies at halfback, but were handi
capped in going around the ends by
lack of team work. Both made some
beautiful runs, but they wore mostly
caused by their ability to easily outrun
.ny of the tacklers. Kennedy kicked
well and, as usual, always bobbed up

when that play was used. lie made

three, fifteen-yard runs in this manner.
In fact the whole team played good
ball, outside of the team work in going
round the ends.
The team was accorded an enthusias
tic reception upon their return, and
judging from the present state of en
thusiasm there will be fully four hun
dred students going to San Jose next
Saturday to see the Stanford Reliance
game.
THE GAME ITSELF.
Stanford started with the ball and by
a series of cud runs and tackle rushes
brought the ball close enough for Lewis
to make a touchdown just four minutes
after play began; score —(i-0. Olym
pics start off with a wedge for 10 Yards.
After several punts and many fumbles
Stanford gets the bali and by the hard
work of Whitehouse and Cochran the
ball is brought again dangerously near
the Olympic's goal. Walton makes a
touchdown. No goal; score —10—0.
Coeh'an and Whitehouse continue to
buck the line till Cochran goes over for
a touchdown; score —1(3-0. Time was
called for first half, when the Olympics
had the ball on Stanford's 25-yard line.
In the second half the Olympics
used the split wedge with disastrous ef
feet, but did little in any other manner.
They started by bucking both Cochran
and Whitehouse for g>od gains, but
Stanford soon got the ball; and by a
20-yard run by Lewis, and rush over
the line by Cochran the score becomes
20-0; no goal. By several clever
wedge plays Stanford sent Kennedy
over the line;*a goal resulted, and the
score stood 26-0. Olympic started
with a fake "V", but on a fumble Stan
ford got the ball and Kennedy again
went over the line; score—B2-0.
Olympics again start off, are forced
back, and on a kick C. Downing inter
feres and causes a touchdown; score,
:>4-0. By a series of all round plays
Stanford scores another touchdown in
six minutes; score, 40-0. Wellington,
who had been playing a fine game at
end for the Olympics, was hurt at this
stage of the game and taken from the
lield. Only three minutes remaiued to
play, but by exceedingly quick work
another touchdown was scored. Ken
nedy kicked goal and the game was
won; 4:0-0
