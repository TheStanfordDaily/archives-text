The present, condition of the student
body bulletin bo; rd is a disgrace to the
quadrangle Beside its decidedly un
tidy appearance it is rendered practic
ally useless by the great number of
notices which were put up some months
ago and are no longer useful A few
days ago one of the professors was heard
to remark that lie had ceased to read
the notices because so many were o'd
and of no us: 1 ' to anyone; that he could
not, find time to pick out the new and
important ones.
If one part of the board were re
served for notices written thereon, and
another for those posted, much diffi
culty would be obviated. We would
suggest that the large black bulletin
board be entirely cleaned every night
by the jani'ors, of all notices written
or posted. Such a p actice, while it
might inconvenience some persons,
would insure more attention on the part
of students, to notices on the board.
If the various persons iuteiested in
their respective notices take enough
interest in them to report them, well
and good; if not, the notices themselves
cannot be very important. One day's
publicity as a new notice is far mure ef
tective than a week's cccupancy of
space surrounded by stale advertise
ments
