Editor ol the Daily Pulo Alto.
An editorial recently published in the
Daily Palo Alto, referring to the
Sunday evening meetings, seems to
compel a reply from some one of a con
trary view. Hoping to receive due and
kindly consideration, as a friendly, yet
decided cri'ic, I must dissent from the
sentiments of the above named article.
Intellectual self-reliance is doubtless
a very good and necessary quality. Hut
when it comes to substituting it, in
religious worship, for reliance upon
11 im whom we profess to worship, do
we not at once destroy all the virtue of
such worship? Is it the purpose of the
Sunday evening meetings to provide an
intellectual feast of university thought?
Or are they for the spiritual growth and
strengthening of the worshipers, and to
give God at least oue weekly opportu
nity to speak with the soul? If the
former is the true idea, I misapprehend.
Surely we need the latter.
Instead of personal testimony being a
degeneration, as 1 understood the writer
it is the greatest help to the Christian
Intellectuality cannot satisfy the sdul'b
cravings. We feed our minds through
the week, and on Sunday evening it
is sad indeed, if one hour cannot be
more profitably devoted to the higher
development of spiritual, life by testi
mony and prater. Doubtless the tuusic
adds muchj but can anything be half so
important as the aid of God's Holy
Spirit. C. N. Bektels, '05.
