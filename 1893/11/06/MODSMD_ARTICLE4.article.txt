# SOPHOMORES ENTERTAIN THE FRESHMEN.
## First Affair of Its Kind in the West. An Attendance of Over Two Hundred. 
### 
Stanford's first inter-class reception
has come and gone, and the general ver
dict is that in every way it was a de
cided success
v\bout 8 p.m. the men's gymnasium
began to fill with sophomores and fresh
men. All were presented at the door
with a card bearing a number; it being
the plan to have everybody become ac
quainted by trying to find his or her
partner for the evening. There were
many more gentlemen than ladies pres
ent, in consequence of which several
gentlemen had the same number and
same lady partner. ' This fact occas
ioned much amusement; as for instance
when one would hunt nearly all evening
for the aring his number, only
to find licr in sweet communion with
the "other fellow," it would have a dis
astrous effect upon his love for his fel
low man. As a means of entertainment
the tlnee having the same numbers
were weighed together, the heavy
weights and featherweights receiving
appropriate presents.
'fhe freshmen were received and en
tertained heartily. Each was made
entirely at home, and a general intro
duction of the two classes was effected.
The decorations consisted in a pro
fusion of green boughs, a cosy little
bower where refreshments were served,
and a huge banner which met the ob
server's eye as he entered, with the
inscription worked in maple leaves,
" '96-'97. '
It is to be hoped that future classes
will emulate the spirit of friendliness
and good feeling shown by the Class of
'06 by doing the same for future fresh
men.
