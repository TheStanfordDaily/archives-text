The existence of the Daily Palo
Alto depends upon its advertisers.
Only by tile r support is it possible to
make the paper a success in any way
For this reason alone the students
should make it their business to deal, so
tar as possible, with adverti-ers only
Those who do not advertise imply that
they do not d sire student, custom and
that they are not supplied wi h stock
suited for them.
On the other hand, our advertisers
represent the best and largest houses
in the city and San Jose. Not only
have they stocks suitable for students,
but they go out of their way to gain
their custom and to keep it Most of
them offer good discounts to University
men and treat tliem in the best possi
ble way.
