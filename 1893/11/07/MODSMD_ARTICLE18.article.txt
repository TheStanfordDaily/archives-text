The question discussed was whether or
not the military control of federal elec
tions in the South would be justifiable
The affirmative was ably presented by
Matthews and Saudwick, and the nega
tive by Stevens and Oolliver. The de
cision of the society was very decidedly
in favor of the negative. In the gen
eral debate much feeling was displayed
on both sides of the question; many of
the members from the Southern states
vowing to resist any such uncalled-for
tyrauny. Foster and Pierson debated
extemporaneously on the question of a
proposed increase in the standing
army, and Bledsoe delivered an oration
on "Vigilance and its principles."
In the business meeting the society
resolved to hold open meetings here
after, and to extend to all, and espec
ially to those interested in literary
work, a cordial invitation to be present.
