# The
						Hopkins Seaside Laboratory.

### 
The laboratory at Pacific Grove es
tablished by Mr. Timothy Hopkins as a
branch of the biological department of
this university is proving to be one of
the most beneficial and popular depart
ments of the institution.
The building, containing three gen
eral loboratories andsix private rooms for
special investigators, is prominently
situated on a low, rugged bluff over
looking the bay of Monterey. The lab
oratory is well equipped with such ap
paratus as dredges, hooks, buckets,
bo its, etc., necessary for collecting.
The chemical and supply department,
which has been recently restocked with
a fine lot of new glassware from Ger
many, is a model of system and neat
ness Running water supplies the
aquaria, in which are kept live
specimens.
Here is an excellent opportunity for
the student of zoology to study the
habits and life history of the denizens
of the deep. The collecting grounds
are much richer in animal and plaut
life than was supposed.
Another notable feature is the well
stocked library of 2,300 bound volumes
aud three thousand pamphlets, contain
ing the latest works of the best Eng
lish, French and German authors. A
complete set of the valuable publications
of the Naples Zoological Station has
been received. Through the generos
ity of Mr. Hopkins §4,000 worth of
books will be added during the present
year.
Mr. Hopkins is very much devoted
to the. work he has begun. Immedi
ately oti his return from Europe he
visited Pacific Grove, and showed a
lively interest in the professors and
students and the investigations they
were making, lie was impressed with
the crowded coudition of the building,
and has decided to have additional
buildings erected before the summer
school of '94. With increased room
and the addition of other facilities it is
hoped that all who apply for admission
will be accommodated. The indications
arc that the attendance next year will
be mui-h larger tluu at the last session.
Several scientists of the east have sig
nified their intention ol attending.
To the student of biology a summer's
course in the laboratory is of inestim
able value. There he may come in
contact with a greater variety and
abundance of animal and vegetable life
than at any other place on the coast,
and the opportunities for original work
are not urpassod by } any other place in
America. There, too, he is in daily
communication with men who stand
lisrt ifs '!>•- eountry in their special
lines of knowl^dcre
O
During the six weeks' session begin
ning .June 15, 1893, those in attend
ance doing originnl and advanced work
were Dr.O. I'. Jenkins, professor of

physiology, Stanford, who performed a
series of experiments on the nervous
system and sense organs of inverte
brates; O. G. Price, instructor in zo
ology, Stanford, studying the embryol
ogy of •elastnobranchs and the hog-fish;
Dr. Howard Ay res, director of the A llis
j Lake Laboratory, Milwaukee, who was
' at work on the anatomy and physiology
of the cyclostome ear; F. M. Me Far
laud, instructor in physiology, Stanford,
studying the embryology of the opis
thobranch mollusks; Dr. 11. Heath,
University of the Pacific, studying the
embryology of the acidians; W. R.
Shaw, assistant in botany, Stanford,
studying and collecting marine algae;
Prof. W. It. Dudley, working on
phyllospodix zostera.
Dr. C. H. Gilbert, one of the direct
ors of the laboratory, was present dur
ing the first week helping to organize
the work. '1 he Stanford students in
attendance were
Miss Kinney Stella Rose
Florence Matson EB. Hoag
.J. M. Hyde C. D. Critehlow
Henry Ilariis H. T. Woodward
Grant Calhoun VV. Briggs
S D. Briggs Evelyn Briggs
G. W. A. Luckey Henry P. Hammond
F. H. Hadley H. A. Kiefer
Kinosuke Otuki N. B. Schofield
J. Van Denburgh Edward Hughes
Prof. B. C. Brown Miss Brown
Those from other points pursuing
work were: C. W. Trent, Prof. Natural
Science in Napa College; Miss Marga
ret Wythe, teacher in Oakland High
School; the Misses O'Mera and Cham
band, teachers in the Santa llosa public
schools, and Miss Frona Alexander, of
Reno, Nevada.
In addition to the regular courses of
instruction that were given in general
an i special biology, a course of evening
lectures was delivered by Pres. Jor
dan, Dr Jenkins, Prof. Dudley, Dr.
Campbell, Dr. Ayres. and Mr. McFar
land. Many of the students and in
structors Pacific Grove all
summer-at work.
