# Interview With Governor McKinley.
## 
### 
In the great Republican landslide of
yesterday Governor McKinley was re
elected chief executive of the Buckeye
state by an overwhelming plurality of
sixty to seventy thousand, a very sig
nifiicant fact as bearing upon the presi
dential campaign of '9t>.
While traveling in Ohio some weeks
ago, en route for Stanford University,
a Daily Palo Alto reporter met the
distinguished statesman on the train
and enjoyed his companionship for an
hour and a half. The Governor was in ;
a happy frame of mind and talked very |
freely about his early life, education do- j
mestie experience, military and politi
cal career. He is an ardent admirer of
the American youth and heartily in
sympathy with the American college
man.
Expressing his opinion of the new
institution on the Pacific, he said:
"Stanford University is a great
school. Lis name has gone around the
globe. It, is the centre of observation
and admiration in the educational world
1 wish the Senator could have lived to
see and enjoy the achievements of the (
institution I once had the honot of
being entertained at, Palo Alto; it is an
ideal site for such a university.
"The law department is to be con
gratulated upon the engagement with
ex President Harrison. A rare treat,
is in store for you fellows. The Gen
eral is one of America's ablest lawyers,
a splendid orator, an excellent in
structor. lie presents his ideas clearly
and in a style rarely equaled."
"Governor, what advice would you
give to a college man who contemplates
the law as his future profession?"
"The law," he replied, "is the most
independent of professions; once ac
quired, it is yours. In laying the
foundation, aim to be cultured; be sym
metrical; be 'all-round.' The law will
come easy
•Tu my estimation, however, com
mereia 1 pursuits oiler better opportuni
ties today to young men of America
than any other field A lawyer's edu
cation, however, will equip him for
other occupations, lie must be a good
business man an)how. To excel in any
undertaking a young man must impress
his mind with this fact: we live iti an
age of specialization. He niu*t master
one thing and do it a little better than
anyone else Many make a good be
ginning, but soon drop out, of the race.
I)urin<r my Congressional carter I was
instrumental in putting fifty poor boys
hi n public, i ffiiies at Washington, with
a view of furthering their educational
plans. It was a 112 tal step. Their sal
aries were large; the gai ies of the cap
ital irresistablo. The result was inevi
table—only one of the fifty broke away j
from the snare. He is nosv a success |
fill lawyer in Kansas."
The interviewer inquired, "What led
you to the study of law?"
"To be candid,'' was the reply, "1
don't know why I studied law. I think j
it must have been through the influence
of my father. Coming out of the army i
he naturally thought I would turn to
the law. After finishing my early ed
ucation at home I went to Alleghany [
College, Meadville, Pa., to complete my J
O'.iU!': c. A f the end "112 t w" ni"oths i '
came home sick. The war broke out |
soon after, and instead of returning to
college I enlisted in the army. After
the Rebellion was over I came back j
home at the age of twenty one, and

shortly thereafter entered the Albany
Law School. It was a commencement
custom among the students to select
their future homes before leaving
school. As a result eighty-five per
cent., of my ela.-s decided to 'go out
west.' That determined me to return
to my home and settle. Acting upon
the decision I went back to Ohio,
where, after a year of additional study,
I was admitted to the bar.
"My first public office was prosecut
ing attorney, at a salary of 81 GOO.
During the term as prosecutor I worked
up a good practice. One day a friend
came into the (fliue and said that I
could go to Congress from that district
if I would allow my name to be used.
I considered the proposition for some
time and finally said 'Go ahead.' I
was nominated on the first ballot
and was successful at the polls. I
had no idea of being a public man, and
expected to drop out alter the cu-tom
ary two terms. 13ut a man came out
and said he was going tc beat me. That
put me on my mettle; 1 became a can
didate for re-election, and thereafter
succeeded myself lor seven terms until
defeated in the gerrymandered district
in 1800 The following year 1 was
elected governor of Ohio."
"Your political career has been em
inently successful "
''Public life, however successful, has
its disadvantages. A man's time is
never bis own; and he is never free
from assault. He may be an idol one
day, despised the next. I had no precon
ceived idea <f my future life. 1 have
simply drifted. Herei lies a distinc
tion between northern and southern
politics. The bciori of a great southern
family is trained up and sent to college
with the express view of preparing for
a Congressional creer. Before Calhoun
entered Yale ho was marked out as
Congressional heir-apparent in his home
district. In the north such things de
pend upon the voice of the people."
"You made a speech today, Gover
nor, did you not?"
"Yes, I addressed a camp meeting
picnic. During the few weeks I
have filled a series of diversified en
gagements, including addresses before
the University of Cincinnati, the Ep
worth League convention, the German
Saeugerfest, the Scotch Irish assembly,
the .Jewish Conclave, Delaware IJniver
s ty, and the Catholic Jubilee."
One of Governor MeKiuley's admir
able qualities is his pronounced domes
ticity. His private life has beeu ex
ceptionally happy. Keferring to his
beloved father, who recently passed
away at a venerable age, he said, in a
voice betraying no little emotion;
"Father was a good friend to me. 11c
was one of the most, remarkable men 1
ever knew; self-educated and a splen
did Shakespearian scholar. A better
read man I have never met. Physic
ally lie had few equals, and was as clear
us a bell until his death at. the age of
eighty-live. Mother still lives; she is
eighty-four 1 leave my rffioe once a
month and go to sec her. It is a
pleasure which 1 never allow myself to
forfeit. I have reached the third stage
of a b"y'H life. In the first period he
leans on Ins parents; m the second he
wfi-jVow out into the w.orld; in the third
lie comes hack to support the declining
years oi father and mother."
The remark was a fitting conclusion.
No higher tribute can be paid to this
foremost American statesman than to

i say of him that he covets no greater ap
plause than his mother's praise; aspires
to no higher place than his filial office.
