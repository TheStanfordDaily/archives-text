# The
						Opinion of a Practical Newspaper Man in Regard to Journalism.
## 
### 
Chas. A. Dana of New York, iu an
address upon "Journalism" before the
students of Uuiou College not long
siuce. said:
Tn regard to this profession there are
two stages. The first stage is the stage
of preparation. There are colleges
which have lately introduced schools of
journalism or departments of journal
ism, where they propose to teach the
art of newspaper making, to instruct
the student in the methods that he
should employ, and to lit him out so
that he can'go to a newspaper office and
make a newspaper.
Well, I do not say that it is not use
ful, hut I have never found that a stu
dent or graduate who had pursmd that
department instead of pursuing other
studies was ol any great avail as a prac
tical worker. In fact, it seems to me,
if I may be allowed a little criticism,
that the colleges generally are rather
branching out too much, until they are
inclined to take the whole universe into
their curriculum, and to teach things
which do not exactly belong there. Give
the yjung man a first-class course of
general education; and if I could have
my way, every young man who is going
to he h newspaper man, and who is not
absolutely rebellious against it, should
learn Greek and Latin alter the good
old fushion. I would rather take a
youug fellow who knows the Aj;ix of
Ciophocle*, and who has read Tacitus,
and who can scan every ode of Horace,
to report a prize fisjht or a spelling
match, 'or instance, than to take one
who has never had those advantages.
