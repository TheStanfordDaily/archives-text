# Euripides.

### 
A good-sized audience listened to the
very interesting lecture of Piuf. Mur
ray la*t evening. The substance of the
lecture was as follows:
The delight that what is best in lit
erature affords us is one of which not
one of us is insensible, and it is the
eternal glory of the Greeks that, ol
what is best in literature, they have
given us much. All that touches
human life finds a place in Homer's
song, and it is just this universal range,
this firm grasp on human life, and fear
less acceptance of human destiny, that
constitute Houier's greatest force. And
similarly in the stately tragedies of Acs
chylus and Sophocles, the poets' view
of life, of sin, and retribution, their
grasp on the vital questions embodied
in the ccaselcss battle of good and evil

principles, hold u.s as under a spell, and
we realize that these, too, are master
minds, minds os such large caliber and
vigorous growth, minds, too, pervaded
by a deep religious sense. With these
must be grouped the splendid odes of
Pindar, for in him too Greek thought
and Greek religion are at their highest.
In art and in literature the Greeks
are eternally our masters. Idealism in
art means Hellenism in art, and the
gravest deficiencies of the literature of
today lie in lines where it is utterly
un-Greek.
I have mentioned Ilomer, Aeschylus,
Sophocles, and Pindar, but there re
mains the third of the three great trag
edians of Greece, Euripides. I have
taken Euripides for the subject of my
lecture tonight, not because he is to me
one of the world's greatest poets, not
because he is typically Greek, but be
cause he is a poet 1 love, and one who
by many scholars has been sadly under
rated. Euripides's literary history has
been a strange one. A teacher to his
contemporaries, beloved above all poets
by succeeding generations, lie was by
far the most popular of the Greek
tragedians till one of his German critics,
Schlegel, held him up to scorn.
Hut wnen you have made
all concessions to criticism, turn
to the poet and see what is
left. He is not Aeschylus, not Sopho
cles; but there is true wit, true pathos,
true poetic feeling, and a broad human
ity which brings Euripides very near
us moderns. In him the student of
Hellenic art sees a decline, but the
student of humanity sees an advance.
No poet ever enjoyed the popu
larity among the Greeks that Eu
ripides did, save llomcr alone.
It is in true pathos, perhaps, that he
excels. Ilecuba mourning over falleu
Troy and her slain children and refus
ing to be comforted because they are
not, is drawn with a power that may
well draw a tear from our modern eyes.
I might go on through play after play,
culling a flower here, a flower there,
each rich with its own beauty and
fragrant with its own perfume. Eurip
ides may not, indeed, bo a poet of the
very first rank, his prologues and epi
logues are sometimes inartistic, but he
is a poet of great merit, a noble man,
full of sympathy ,|fulllof the tender af
fections of the husband, the brother,
and the friend, and open to all that
touches the human heart.
VVc laugh at Aristophanes's carica
tures, at his irresistible parodies, but
we come back to Euripides with an ever
increasing love because he is a man like
us. He is not an Aeschylus, not a ISoph
oclcs, but oi' neither Aeschylus not
Sonhoeifs. cnuld TÂ»lis. l.uvc
I
written the tine lines
Our Euripides, the human,
With his droppings of warm tears,
And his touches of things common
Till they rose to touch the spheres.
