Attention was called in yesterday's
issue to the fact that students and pro
fessors should give their hearty sup
port to those business houses which
have manifested an interest in the stu
dents' welfare hy advertising in the
Daily Palo Alto. A number of col
lege dailies have had a prospective
existence,, several have begun publica
tion but soon were compelled to cease
on account of ''financial stringency."
Only eight are published in the United
States today. Ours is the younge t and
only one west of Wisconsin. It is a
matter of looal pride that the Daily
Palo Alto may continue, and no per
sons have shown their good will to any
greater extent or given more substan
tial aid towards the continuation of the
paper than our local merchants. To
them, very largely, we owe our exi.-t
ence, and in return for this kindness ol
their's in helping us, we owe our loyal
support. It is earnestly hoped that all
profess rs and students will show a
marked partiality towards our local ad
vertisers.
