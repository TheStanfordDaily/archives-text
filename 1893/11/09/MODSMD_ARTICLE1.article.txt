Being a discussion of the relations of
the numbers of vertebrae among fishes
to the temperature of the water aud to
the character of the struggle for exist
ence; by David Starr Jordan, LL. D.
(A reprint from the Wilder Quarter-
Century Book.)
In certain groups of fishes the north
ern or cold water representatives have
a larger number of vertebrae than those
members which are found in tropical
regions. In groups containing fresh
water and marine members the fresh
water forms have in general more verte
brae than those found in the sea The
ii-hes inhabiting the depths of the sea
have more vertebrae than their relatives
living near the shore. The fishes of
the earlier geological periods have, for
the most part, numerous vertebrae, and
those fiahes with the low numbers (-4
to 26)fouud iu the specialized spiny
r .yed fishes, appear only iu compara
tively recent, times. Iu short, those
types of fishes which are properly char
acterized by increased numbers of ver
tebrae predominate in the fresh waters,
the' deep seas, and in Arctic and
Antarctic regions. Ou the other hand
the spiny-rayed fishes arc largely in the
majority in the tropics.
The extent to which the above gen
cralizations are true is discussed, and is
illustrated by giving iu detail the -lum
bers of the vertebrae in the different
groups of fishes.
The facts as stated arc all referred to
the same group of causes. The cause
of the reduction in number of the ver.
tebrae is sought in conditions peculiar
to tropical seas, '''he cause of the re
tention of the primitive type, as shown
by the large number of vertebrae in
certain cases, is explained by t.he con
ditions present iu the colder seas, in
the rivers, and in the oceanic abysses.
By rlie influence of natural selection,
the spiny-rayed fish, so characteristic
of the present geological era, has di
verged from its soft-rayed ancestry.
Now, it is in the tropical seas that are
found the external conditions nr>st fav
orable to fish life. There in the warm
water, among rocks and along the coral
reef near the shore, is competition
sharpest. In the tropical seas are
found the influences which serve to
make a li-h more intensely and com
pletely a fi>h, and which tend to rid it
of every character not needed in fish
life. This process of intensification of
ti<h-like characters is termed ' Ichthyi
zation "
On the other hand the cold and ex
clusion of the polar seas, the monotony,
darkness, and cold of the oceanic
abysses, and the restrictions incident to
life in fresh water, all tend to limit
changes of structure in the fish.
One important factor iu "ichthyiza

tion," as explained above, is the reduc
tion of the number of vertebrae. This
reduction, then, is regarded as a phase
in the process of specialization which
has brought about the typical, highly
developed spiny-rayed fish of the tropi
cal seas The discussion is enliveued
by a well-drawn comparison in which
the aualogy of fish life in the tropics to
modern city life is shown. Following
out the same line of thought, the other
regions under consideration are termed
a sort of "ichthyological backwoods."
The paper closes with an historical
sketch of the discussion of the problem
by other scientists.
