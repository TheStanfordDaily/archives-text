# An Editorial from the Examiner.
## 
### 
David Starr Jordan is the right
sort of man to have at the head of a
university. Me docs not consider that
his useful activity should be bounded by
the walls of the seminary of which he is
the president. On fitting occasions he
invades the environing non-scholastic
world, and with pen and tongue spreads
knowledge. Tonight, for example, he
begius in this city a series of popular
lectures on evolution. A receut sym
posium in the Examiner, in which Pro
fessor Jordan participated, discussing
the bearing of the development theory
upon orthodox Christian theology, ex
cited so much comment that the pies 1 -
dent of Stanford has rightly decided
that the public is sufficiently interested
in this feature of science to justify him
in explaining to it in detail just what
evolution is and what it meaus.
It is fortunate tor the Stanford Uni
versity and for the stute tint it is under
the direction of a man too large to be
infeetid by the academic spirit, with all
its paralizing narrowness. A univer
sity should be the center of spreading
thought and light and courage, not a
mere hive in which professors drone
and students gather musty honey. The
academic atmosphere induces a false
dignity, a tone of scholastic exclusive
ness, and a pride of caste which com
bine to contract the mind and impede
progress. The preposterous notion is
fostered that the cilucator lowers him
self by crossing the campus and telling
what he knows to common men.
One man of science and sffnse like
President Jordan is worth more
if'urnia than a hundred Dryasdusts,
learned and dully pompous.
