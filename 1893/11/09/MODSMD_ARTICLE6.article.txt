# Last Night's Line-up.
## 
### 
A general improvement in the play
ing of the Varsity team lias made itself
manifest in the last day or so. Last
night there were many evidences that
the Varsity is rapidly improving in
team play. The second eleven received
relief in several positions, and with the
acquisition of fresh material every few
minutes played a good defensive game,
but still the superiority of the first
eleven was evident to all.
Frankenheimer showed up better last
night than ever before. He is a very
good man to have behind the line, but
seems to be too excitable at critical
moments. Walton went through the
line like a shot. He fights for every
inch of ground. Kennedy should be
sent through the line more. lie keeps
his feet better thau any other man on
the team.
Another noticeable feature of late is
the wedge playing. In this style of
playing Stanford is greatly improving,
and the wedge play is now one of the
most interesting features of the daily
practice. It must be remembered that
Berkeley relies much also on the wedge,
and it remains to be seeu whether Stan
ford or U. C. has become tfic more
proficient in the"V ''
Jack Reynolds made his appearance
in football apparel yesterday, and
p'ayed left half on the second eleven.
llis work was very good, and it can be
seen that he has the making of a first
class football player.
Everyone on the second team put up
a good game. It would be hard to find
a better team to practicc with on the
coast.
