Contributions are invited from all persons
interested in university life and aims.
Subscription, one year, $3.00; semester, $1.75.
Payable in advance. Single copies live cents.
Entered at the Stanford University postoffioe
as second class mail matter.

We note with pleasure the improved
condition of the student body bulletin
board. No notices will be left on the
board longer than twenty-four hours.

Stanford University is thoroughly
imbued with a healthful athletic spirit.
The important question now is, "llow
shall we continue it and derive the
greatest benefit therefrom?" Inter
collegiate supremacy is an effective
stimulus, no doubt; but for the devel
opment of long-winded, win-every-time
quality on the oval, the diamond, and
the track, there is nothing half so effi
cient as sharp inter-class rivalry.
Among the larger schools of the eastern
aud middle states this spirit is fostered
and fed by annual contests for class
prizes; for instance, a silver cup is
given by the Class of '93 to the winning
class team in football or baseball, the
trophy to remain in the school and be
contested for each year. The prize
may be a modal, a pennant, or any
other emblem of honor. Its possession
is always a coveted mark of great dis
tinction, and is hotly contested for by
the various classes. As a result all the
available material in the student body
is put to the test, the best men are
brought oui, college spirit is invigor
ated, and the varsity teams reap incal
culable beuefits that they might not
otherwise acquire. Class plays against
class with as much dash and aggressive
ness as varsity agaiust varsity, thereby
enjoying a real training instead of the
more or less artificial drill where the
element of rivalry is lacking.
If the loyal classes of Stanford would
evince devotion to the interests of their
alma mater, here is the opportunity to
effect good results that will be both im
mediate and lasting.
