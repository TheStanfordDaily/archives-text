The work of the team for the past
week has been by far the best of the
year. Some of the men are doing all
that can be expected of them. But
one in particular has been doing such
good playing the last few days that it
would be uufair not to make a favorable
mention of him. Kennedy, whom
lleft'elfinger styles the best punter on
the const, has been doing more than
brilliant work. Some of his runs have
gained for him the name of the "artful
dodger." It is to be hoped that he
continues in his improvement. His
interference is not-up to his last year's
form.
Walton, Code, Frankenheimer, and
Lewis arc doing good, conscientious
work. All the line men are showing
up well. McMillan wa6 layed off on
account of a strained tendon iu one leg,
but will be all right for tomorrow's
game.
Every Stanford student should
realize the fact that tomorrow's game
means a great deal to football. It is
the criterion by which one is to judge
the strength of the
keley his met the Reliance team twice,
and in the last game the scorc of 22 to
10 indicates a game in which our rivals
from Berkeley had not much the better
of it.
The Olympics, whom Stanford de
feated so signally last Saturday, will
meet the U. C at Oeutral Park tomor
row, and from these two games, the
one at San Jose, the other at San Fran
cisco, the strength of the two teams can
he fairly estimated.
But one should not depend too much
on these try-outs. There is such a
thing as improvement, and if it can be
made Berkeley will be just the one to
make it. No one should be too confi
dent. If Stanford wins tomorrow's
game, so much more to our honor, but
we hope that the players will not form
their opinions too firmly upon these
preliminaries. It is to be hoped that
Stanford will be well represented to
morrow in the grand stands.
