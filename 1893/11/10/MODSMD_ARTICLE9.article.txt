At a meeting of the Students' Con
gross at Berkeley a challenge was ac
cepted fora joint debate with the
Hastings Law College. The debate
will take place in five or six weeks.
The speakers chosen to represent Ber
keley are Friend, Samuels and Mc-
Noble. Judging from the reports
published weekly in regard to literary
affairs at the U. of C. the Berkleyans
are getting down to business. They
think that their prospects are most en
couraging for defeating Stanford next
spring in the inter-collegiate debate.
