# One More Victory for Stanford.
## 
### 
When the Stanford team left for San
Jose last Saturday it was with no idea
that their victory would be so decisive
and easy as it turned out. About 700
people were in attendance, a very large
number when it is remembered that the
San Jose people were deceived by a
fictitious Varsity team last year, a con
temptible trick which they will never
forget.
Much mention of Saturday's game is
unnecessary. Stanford started off with
a' V ' and gained twelve yards. With
in a few miuutes Walton landed the
ball in touch and Kennedy kicked the
fi - st goal Reliance lost the ball in
the first play on i fumble, and the
good work of Cochran, Kennedy,
Frankenheimer, and Walton the ball
was placed within a few yards of the
goal line, where it was l >st on a fumble
by Kennedy. Rfiance soon lost the
ball, and by a brilliant run of twentv
yards by Walton, gains by Cochnn,
Kennedy, and Whitehouse the ball was
forced over the line ajjain Kennedy
missed the goal. From now on the
only thing that the Reliance team could
do wa. to prevent the score from at
taining large proportions, but in spite
of their good defensive work Stanford
scored four more touchdowns and four
more goals
B illiant work by Cochran. Franken
heiuicr, Whitehouse, and Walton es
pecially, would bring the ball danger
ously near the Reliance goal, then
Kennedy would force it through (or a
touchdown. All the Varsity line men
played an excellent game, Whitehouse
and Cochran taking the ball.us much as
the backs. Whitehouse made some
remarkable gains, one run extending
nearly half the length of the field.
Walton was again the strong man. lie
was given the ball frequently three
times in succession. tiis work is
worthy of considerable praise. Frank
enheimer played a iroud hard game,
interferring well, and doing the best
tackling on the field Kennedy played
a star game His punting and kicking
were almost perfect. C >de played his
u.-ual cuol and brilliant game at quarter
and interfered well. Capt. Wilson,
Claude I'owning, and Spalding, who
took Wilson's place in the second half,
played excellently on the ends
For the ltelianee team Felton Taylor
played the best game. Edwards, For
ter, and Wykoff also did very good
work.
