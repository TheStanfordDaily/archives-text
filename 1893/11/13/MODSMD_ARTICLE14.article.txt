Saturday's g<uie was, in more re
spects than one, very unsatisfactory
The playing of the teams was too slow
and there was noue of that quick, snappy
playing which made our game with the
Olympics so exciting This sluggish
ness was due entirely to the Reliance
team, who were continually delaying the
game by taking out time on account ot
some slight injury, or. more often, to get
breathing spell.
It is not our purpose to criticise mi
nutely the playing of the teams, but we
do think that the action of some of the
players deserves the most scathing re
buke. Such a slugging match as oc
curred between a Stanford playrr and
two lleliaucc men is to be deplored.
The referee should have immediately
disqualified the player on our team and
the two players on our opponents' team
who openly resorted to methods which
both the rules of the game and gentle
manly conduct foibid. If this had
been done football would have been con
sidered in a better light, l>y many of the
spectators who were unfamiliar with
the game and with the provocation
which our player received.
