The author of that admirable editor
ial which appeared in the columns of
the Daily Palo Alto a few days
ago exposing the thievery that has beeu
goini; on in various rooms in Enoina by
means of pass keys,(failed to notion that
there is another phase of this criminal
practice, more alarming in its propor
tions. For s >me time it has been
the practice of these small people 'o cut
the lock chains and take bicycles out of
the basement and abuse them by care
less ridin gcr to return them to their
places after they have 1 ecn ridden over
a satisfactory uumber of ditches and
railroad tracks. Oftentimes the wheels
are returned besmeared with mud and
generally with a few broken spokes and
bent cranks These persons, whoever
they are, are not absolutely devoid of
taste, for as a general thing they pick
out the newest'wheels. Now, that jus
tice may be done to those who are so
unfortunate as to have wheels, it is only
fitting and proper that an effort be made
by some one to apprehend those who
have so ignored the rights of others
Unless such practices are stopped there
will be an unpleasant sequel to it all
Who are the guilty ones?
Wheelman.
