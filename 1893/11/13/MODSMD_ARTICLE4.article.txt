# Rev. Garnett's Sermon.

### 
The subject of Sunday morniug's ad
dress was "The nature of the inner
life." In brief this is the line of
thought:
As civilization advances we come to
know more and uiore of the outer li'e,
of science, and of institutions; this can
not be too highly commended, hut we
must not. forget the inner life of man,
which is in danger of becoming ne
glected. "Kuow thyself" is the com
mand to us.
The heart is the vantage point from
whence we see the invisible; when rev
erent it becomes the throne of God
Conscience is the all important word in
this inner kingdom, and motive is its
queen. Motive gives the moral quality
to life, and the best, gospel today is that,
which will tend to purify it. The polit
ical troubles between man and man are
not brought about by what he does, so
much as by what he intends to do.
Our thoughts are the atmosphere
which gives life to this inner kingdom;
so it is our duty to purify them. Ten
nyson says ' Think well, and to do well
will follow."
Again, it is essential that there be
true and lofty ideals; the measure of
every man is the measure of his ideals.
Hut these to bÂ»* of value must be tem
pered with reison, and must not be mor
ally weak.
Emerson says that God enters by a
hidden door into every life, and in or
der to make our inner life erfect we
must live in constant association with
the one from whom we move, live, and
have our being.
