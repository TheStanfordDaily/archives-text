everything th.it our opponents have to
say about tlurnselves or about the
strength of our own team. We know
precisely how matters stand. All our
dealings with our opponents have been
above board and entirely free from
chicanery. On the other hand there
has always been a suspicion of scheming
connected with all their dealings with
us: and now at a critical moment, when
over confidence will ruin our work and
our prospects, they do all in their
power to make us believe that we are
invincible.
Their evident in'cntion is to deceive
us, and keep us entirely in the dark
with regard to their strength, by this
means causing us to underestimate
their power, and being the surest way
to weaken us in every way, offensive
and defensive. They have tak«jn care
not to play as a team in public in any
one case. Instead of putting up a
team representing their strength last
week they allowed four of their men to
watch our own play at San .Jose. One

could gain no more pointers than a

Their whole policy is one meant to
mislead and confute us in our estimate
of the struggle iu store for us. We
can form no judgment, whatever of the
strength of their united team, and so it
behooves us to not and work as thnn<>h
