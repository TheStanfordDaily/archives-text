The Zoological Club.
The keen interest many of the stud
ents have in the study of zoology is
manifested by the lame attendance at
the regular meetings of the Zoological
Club.
At last night's meeting W. W. Price
exhibited three species of mammals
which have never before Ijicii found in
this locality. One of these, the Sit
onni/s (ri'/jrrli (Gilbert's Mouse), is
ol special interest, as it is named in
tionor of Dr. Gilbert.
Dr (J lbert and Van '01,
gave a very interesting account of their
recent expedition to the Mojive Desert.
Among the collections they brought
back whs a new species of lizard.
There is now in the zoological collect
ion all the species of lizards accredited
to California, except, two. They also
took a number of stickleback fish in the
extreme part of the state; these are pe
culiar in having no plates on the sides
of the body, and are the only ones of
this variety that have been seen since
18(51.
