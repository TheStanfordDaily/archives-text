# Football Practice.
## 
### 
The two teams came out earlier than
usual yesterday afternoon and
played thirty minute halves.
Four o'clock seems to be the
best time for practice as it gives
plenty of time for playing before dark
ness sets in. The game was not a very
good one. One of the players re
marked, "It was the worst game ever
played on the campus."
A general improvement in the team's
playing is making itself manifest.
Kennedy, WaltOu, and Frankenheimer
did some good running, but were slow
in getting down to work. The second
eleven bucked the line ou numerous
occasions and made the Varsity work
for their t,(mob-downs.
