# Division of Reserved Seats for the Thanksgiving Game.
## 
### 
Messrs. Dcrmiati and Mayuard,
Gentlemen:â€”ln deciding the ques
tion submitted tome as to liow reserved
seats at the Thanksgiving game should
be divided between the two universities,
I have tignred upon the sale of 2,700
reserved seats, these being, in my
opinion, the only seats which will com
mand any view of the side lines of the
football field. They may be described
as follows: kindergarten, 200 seats;
bleachers, 1,200 seats; chairs in grand
stand, 1,100 scats; benches (covered),
200 seats. In my opinion it would be
unsafe and unfair to the patrons of
football to sell more than this number
of reserved seats.
After weighing the arguments of
both sides, 1 am satisfied that the in
terest of the game will be the best
served by making such a division as
will permit the students of each univer
sity and their friends to sit in a body,
and I therefore recommend the follow
ing division:
Draw a line nortli and south through
the bleacher at a point so far east of the
chairs in the grand stand as to permit
of a seating capacity of fifty people to
the west of such line. Let one of you
take all the reserved seats on the one
side ol said line and the others take all
the seats on the other side of said line.
Choice to be determined by lot, the
losing university to have the first choice
at the next game, no matter where the
game may be played or what the ar
rangement of seats may be.
Each side has its advantages, and
there is not in my opinion much in the
way of choice. The winner should
however, in my opinion, grant to the
los-r the right of first choice for the
next year. Yours truly,
William Thomas.
We assent.
