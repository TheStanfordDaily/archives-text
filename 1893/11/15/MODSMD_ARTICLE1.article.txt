# PROF. E.E. SMITH'S LECTURE.
## A 						Day in Africa. 
### 
The chapel was well filled last even
ing. The following is the substance of
the very interesting lecture:
One day last August, as I stood gaz
ing upon the dreamy splendors of the
Alhambra ruins, I determined to visit
the ''land of the dark eyod maiden and
the dusky Moor," the deft fingers of
whose ancestors fashioned those marvel
ous frescoes and that lace-work of stone
—a nation with a noble history, but
like the Alhambra fast crumbling into
ruins.
Less is known of Morocco than of
any of the other North African
c luntries; indeed the interior boundaries
of the country are but conjecture, and
many of the districts are as inaccessible
to the traveler as the heart, of China.
The entire decadence of the literature
of the country makes definite informa
tion from eye witnesses of double value.
All doors are humble in Morocco,
any appearance of wealth or even thrift
being an open invitation to the sultan,
more tyrannical than the ezar of Russia
or the sultan of Turkey, to confiscate
the superabundance of goods, assassina
tion or imprisonment often being
adroitly planned to preveut possible
resistance.
From the gu'des waiting at my door
I selected "Archie," a gaily dressed,
intelligent young Arab whom I soon
found was most tactful in extracting
small coins from my pocket Archie
led me through a labyrinth of vile
smelling, narrow lanes, pave! in the
rudest possible fashion, as indeed are all
the streets. We emerged into the
main street where the venders of fruits
and nuts, shoes and pottery, are located
V r enders of melons are squatted upon
the stones, as are low caste Jewish and
Arabian women, selling loaves and
crusts of dark biead. The shops are
little eUe than openings in the walls.
The) have ten-foot counters, flush with
the wall and street, the usual means of
egress and ingress being over the
counter. The customers stand in the
vtropt. and :tr*» rifvor p*por*t»>H t.n psiv
the prices asked. The expert shoe
maker and merchant waxes and works
the thread with his toes, while he
stitches the heelless, counterless, red
and yellow slippers.
One is much surprised at the num
ber of white-bearded, venerable Arabs,
but as they xoem to have only one am
bition, and that to squat cross-legged on
the ground, there seems no reason why
they should not live to a ripe old age,
barring accident from starvation.
We passed a mosque; all Moors and
Arabsare fanatic Mohammedans. Thirty
pairs of slippers sit in a row near the
door, as no Mohammedan crosses the
threshold of mosque or home without
first kicking off his slippers. The

mosque has a facing of beautiful green
ish tiles which can only be seen where
the whitewash has peeleil off. There
are a number of examples of beautiful
tile work in the city, but so devoid of
the love of art have the Moors become
that the monotonous whitewash covers
them all 1 wished to enter the mosque
but was informed by Archie that in
stant death would be the penalty were 1
so much as to look inside.
We now pass down a road inside
the city wall, facing the sea; every
available spot is occupied by a cross
legged, silent Arab, apparently lost in
deep thought: in reality too lazy to
move. The roadway widens a little and
a small stre tin of water trickles out of
the wall into a large stone and mud
basin. A bare-legged negro stands in
the basin vainly trying to fill his goat
skin from the little stream, but after a
while, out of patience, he puts the goat
skin between his feet in the b sin,
swashes it full of the filthy water, and
goes up the hill chanting a weird ditty.
At night there is much to see in
Tangiers. Like shadows we made our
way through the tortuous lanes. There
were no bright windows gas, or electric
light—nothing but darkness and op
pressive silence, broken by the slamming
of shutters and rattling of doors, chains,
and bolts. Arabs are wrapping them
selves in their mantles and lying down
in the streets to sleep. Here and there
we step over the prostrate body of a
sleeping policeman
A stupid sentinel, with a clank and
rattle of bolts, lets us through a worm
eaten gate, and we are in a kind of
combination theatre and cafe Six
performers sit cross-legged upon mats;
a soug is chanted, accompanied by a
two-string violin and much clapping of
hands.
As we retrace our steps through the
dark and silent lanes suddenly piercing
screams rend the air, accompanied by
a violent outburst of language. We
loiter a moment, but it is only a Moor
playing a tatoo with a stick upon the
back of a luckless slave.
