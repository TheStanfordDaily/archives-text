# THE 						AMERICAN UNIVERSITY AND THE AMERICAN MAN.
## Prof. Howaid's Commencement Address. 
### 
The second annual commencement
address, delivered by Geo. E. Howard,
professor of history, has recently been
published by the University. It is a
neatly printed, twenty two page pam
phlet, and is now on sale at the co-op.
The following extracts may serve to
give some idea of this very interesting
address.
''The significance o f our epoch ap
pears to be that humanism is at last
triumphant in the realm of thought.
To realize the truth of this statement
three questions arise: (1) What is the
nature of the new humanism and how
is it influencing our conception of cul
ture? (2) What must be the character
of the new American university
through which this conception may
best find expression? (3) What, ac
cordingly, is the essential function
which the American university is
called upon to perform?"
In accordance with the above synop
sis the address is divided into three
parts. The first part, on the new hu
manism, shows the influence of evolu
tion upon the relative value of culture.
It describes the faults and virtues of
the humanists of the fifteenth and
eighteenth centuries. In the eighteenth
century is the humility which betokens
wisdom.
The discovery of the law of evolution
renders the nineteenth century renais
sance the most significant crisis in
history, and this crisis is determining
the character of the modern university.
There is a growing tendency to abandon
the traditional assumption that there is
an essential difference in the scholastic
value of studies. On account of this
tendency, new departments of study
have sprung up, and surprising affinities
have been discovered between the var
ious branches of study. An important
mark of the humanism is the universal
ity of its sympathy. It is the supreme
function of culture to l'ft humanity up
ward. At last society has become self
conscious. This is the secret of the
nineteenth century Renaissance.
The university of the future must be
come the representative of the dynamic
culture. The getting of knowledge for
its own sake is but little more commend
able than the getting of knowledge for
the accumulation of wealth alone.
The American university must be
freed from the restraint of ancient forins #
I'rof. Howard here cites the objection
of a distinguished German professor,
Dr. Von Hoist, to our universities, who
compares them with the European uni
versities. He defines our universities
as "hybrids as college and university;
a torso of a university." It is worthy
of note that Prof. Howard is the first

American to take exception to such
criticism. In answer to Dr. Von Hoist
he says "Why should America have a
university in the European sense? Tt
is not by the slavish imitation of foreign
models that a true university can he
formed for any people. Education in
this country has been influenced en.
tirely too much by European tradition.
Although the Germans have tauirht us
much, nevertheless the German univer
sity is not the ideal for us. The spirit
of the nineteenth century Renaissance
is absolute freedom in teaching or tak
ing that which is taught. This re
quires two things: free differentiation
of departments and free election of
studies; and in addition we must have
complete equality of studies .In its
relative capacity when fully developed,
to satisfy the needs of the society which
has called it into being, the new Amer
ican university, in its possibilities,
stands absolutely without a peer."
"The function of the American uni
versity is to direct self-conscious so
ciety in the dual task of self-regenera
tion and self-development. Never be
fore have so many difficult problems
pressed forward for solution. These
problems are social, economic, political,
scientific, and religious in their nature,
and it is for the American university
in a large measure to settle them,".
