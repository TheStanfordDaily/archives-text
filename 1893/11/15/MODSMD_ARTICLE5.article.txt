# Tuesday's Practice.
## 
### 
A great deal better game was played
yesterday than on Monday. In the
first half it looked as if there would be
a repetition of the poor playing that
characterized Monday's game, but after
the boys got warmed up to their work
the playing was clean and qu ck.
Walton distinguished himself more than
ever by his all-round playing. Ken
nedy played well, and Lewis made a
beautiful run of thirty yards on a catch
of McKay's punt. Burnett played the
best game of the line men. He made
three or four tackles behind the line.
The second eleven worked hard and
bucked the Varsity line for numerous
gains, ltutan played well on the line
and tackled excellently.
Ilarrelson made the prettiest tacklc
seen on the field when he downed Ken
nedy. Every player on the team seems
to realize fully that we cannot win from
the U. C. unless there is a great deal
of improvement. The remaining time
is none too long to put the Varsity into
the best trim, and every day's practice
should make the team stronger in some
respect.
