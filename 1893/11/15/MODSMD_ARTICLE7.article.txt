It gives us the greatest pleasure to
note the large attendance and the
lively interest manifested at yesterday's
meeting of the Associated Students.
It shows true college spirit to attend all
meetings of organizations with which
the student may be counected, and we
hope that a meeting will never again
be forced to adjourn for the mere lack
of a quorum.
