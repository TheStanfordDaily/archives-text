The Berktlryun deplores in one of its
late issues the lack of enthusiasm on
the part of the spectators at the football
practice. It even {joes so far as to say
that the spectators are as dumb as a
Boston audience, nnd that they will
forget how to cheer by thanksgiving.
In marked contrast to this deplorable
lack of interest on the part of Berkeley
students is the hearty support to
our team by the student body. Every
night sees a large and en husiastic
crowd on the football field, and the
best plays are generously applauded.
This interest is as extensive among the
ladies as the gentlemen, and should be
a matter of pride not only to the im
mediate members of the football team
but to all interested in college athletics.
