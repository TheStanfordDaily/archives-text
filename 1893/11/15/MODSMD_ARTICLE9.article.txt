In order to place our annual football
games upon a solid basis it is necessary
that we have a football league, gov
erned by adequate rules and regula
tions; and fjr the same reason we must
govern our inter collegiate debates by a
system of by-laws which will insure
fairness to all concerned, and also pro
vide regular inter-collegiate literary
contests between the two universities of
the west. And, having no professional
schools ourselves, it should be our fur
ther purpose to exclude from such con
tests the representatives of all profes
sional schools.
In the east debating leagues and
oratorical contests are common, and
they can be made a prominent feature
of college society on this coast. We
hope the committee will at once get to
work, so that, side by side with our
football and baseball players, our de
haters can be training fora contest
with our rival across the bay. The
formation of the league would do more
to promote literary interests in the two
universities than a score of lifeless
literary societies.
