The following short note was re
ceived by Captain Wilson last evening
and posted on the Kncina Ilall bulletin
board:
Captain Wilson:
Do not be fooled by Berkeley's weak
ness. It is all a lleffolfinger bluff
A Kill IiND.
The effect of this note has been to
considerably dampen the ardor o! even
the most enthusiastic supporter of the
team. Those who saw the team pi a}
such good ball last week have been car
ried iiwav with the idea that our team
is invincible, al.owing themselves, no
doubt, to be convinced of Betkeley's
utter helplessness, by the amusing wails
of Heffelfiuger.
When the U. C. can make such an
admirable showing against the strong
athletic club teams by playing only her
second eleven, we may reasonably look
forward with apprehension to ti e meet
ing of her varsity and our crippled team.
With half of our team gone stale from
poor training facilities, the outlook is
not at all promising when we remember
that there yet remains a fortnight for
the Berkeley eleven to improve under
the watchful training of her three Yale
coaches.
