### 
The following editorial taken from
the last issue of the ttrrkeJeyait explains
itself:
W'e note with pleasure that the
Bushnell Union and the Students' Con
gress have made arrangements fora
series of debates \V« understand that
special reg id is had to preparation for
(lie inter-eolleaiate debate next spring.
That the debuting contest with Stanford
is to be repeated this year the great
success of the first o~e ought to assure.
Accordingly it is high time that we
are getting ready and preparing for the
fij»ht. We must win this time, and
winning means working. The college
should take the liveliest interest in
these prelimina'y and preparatory con
tests between our two societies, and
uive them the heartiest support in at
tendance and appreciation. We should
remember that there, is a class of people
—not a small one either, and one that
contributes not a little to our Uni
versity support—-upon whom a credit
able debate will make a better impres
sion than a football victory.
