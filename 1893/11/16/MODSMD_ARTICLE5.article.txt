### 
A prominent eastern writer on the
great inter-collegiate game ends a recent
article with the following remarks:
The game of football is not without a
certain moral effect upon the players.
I believe that it, is one of the manliest
of games. It is conceded that it has a
tendency to bring all the muscular
powers to their highest perfection. The
game also calls fora high mental devel
opment. No dullard can play it suc
cessfully, however great his physical
development. The skillful player must
exercise courage, judgment, and prompt
ness of decision It will not admit of
shams or subterfuge. It must, be an
honest trial of strength and skill; and
hence it appeals to what is fairest and
noblest in men.
