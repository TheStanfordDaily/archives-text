# The 						U.C.'s Appeal for Sympathy.
## 
### 
The statement made in last Tuesday's
Call that Stanford's team is lighter
than ours demands the most vigorous
contradiction on the part of all lovers of
our university For two years Stan
ford has gained the sympathy of the
populace by posing as the '-under dog,"
and now that fortuitous circumstance
has given us that enviable distinction,
it is too had to have a corrupt press
snatch from us our privelcye and
chances for the public sympathy.
Arise, ye down-trodden! Assert your
weakness, that the eyes of the pitying
world may wcp for you! Let not the
public tears be shed for Palo Alto!
For lo! she has raised a mighty team
oven heavier thun ours; wuild win
the game—and «ain :he pity of the
sympathetic people, too. It must not
be; it shall not For two years now
has the weight been on one side
and the pity on the other. The bal
ance of power is threatened Stanford
wants them both. It is a revolution of
settled usage; it is a defiance of custom.
Hprkeley r ises as a man and demands
her rights!—Uerkeleyan.
