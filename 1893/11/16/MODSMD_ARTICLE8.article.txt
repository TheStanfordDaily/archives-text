## A 						U.-C. Alumnus Objects to Paying $1.50 to See the Football Game on Thanksgiving.

The following article appeared in this
morning's Examiner:
r lo the Editor of the Examiner:—
Sir; I notice in this morning's paper
that the managers of the Football
League have decided upon raising the
admission price to the great Varsity
game on Thanksgiving hay to SI 50.
As an alumnus of the U. C., I wish to
protest against this action of the mana
gers, and for these reasons:
As I understand it, these contests are
primarily encouraged to induce interest
in college amateur athletics and to af
ford a legitimate vent for the overflow
ing animal exuberance of the youthful
student In my college days pecun
iary profit was not sought for, our one
object in charging an admission fee
being to obtain sufficient funds to cover
the actual expenses of the game.
Excepting the members of the two
outside cluhs, the undergraduates, the
alumni of the two colleges and their
families are the ones who take the most
interest in these great games. Most of
these are men of small means, who
would enjoy taking their families and
have an afternoon's thorough enjoy
ment. But if this high admission fee
is insisted upon, few will be able to at
tend. And I hold that thesi men, who
make up the bone and sinew of the
undergraduates and of the alumni, de
serve the first consideration at the hands
of the managers, and that, the many
wealthy outsiders who are willing to go
aud pay any price merclj because it is
the proper thing to do now. are an after
consideration. In college sports college
men, in or out of college, deserve the
first place
The expenses of maintaining the
elevens and of conducting the grimes
certainly do not. warrant such an exor
bitant chargrt, and I hope that the com
mittee who have this matter in charge
will reconsider their action and reduce
the admission fee now decided upon at
least one-half.
Finally, I wish to enter a general
protest against the growing tendency to
make all celebrations and dinners con
nected with college life too elaborate
and expensive for men of small or mod
erate means to participate in.
All college reunions, and the Thanks
giving football game if properly con
ducted would be a yreat reunion, are
chiefly enjoyable because of the college
associations and friendships reawakened
in those who attend, but thi« o«sontinl
element will be eliminated if our old
chums and friends are prevented from
attending because of an extortionate
admission charge.
