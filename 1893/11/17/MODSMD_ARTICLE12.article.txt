Persons who are interested in the
outcome of the intercollegiate debate
which will take place next spring will
find food for considerable serious
thought in the extracts from U. C
papers recently published in our col
uuius. It is very evident our rivals
are doing everything in their power to
insure to themselves victory. The var
ious literary societies at Herkuley have
arranged debates and contests among
themselves, designed to bring out their
best debating material to send against
our representatives.
While our opponents are thus en
gaged it might be well to enquire con
cerning our own preparations for this
great event. It is hardly necessary to
say that as yet we have done very little.
Indeed, our literary societips have been
almost forgotten in the general enthus
iasm over football. Now, we do not
mean to deprecate the prevailing in
terest taken in athletics; far from it.
Yet we should not forget that Stanford
will win as much prestige by a victory
in the intercollegiate debate as by a
victory on Thanksgiving d-iy We
should endeavor to maintain our super
iority both in athletics and in literary
work The two should go hand in
hand
We have three debating societies in
active operation, each one of which is
doing good work. We suggest that
they organize an inter-society league,
hold joint debates open to the public,
and thus institute a healthful rivalry
among the organizations. The work
would be more interesting, and produc
tive of better results. Training is just
as essential to ssuueeas uputi the debat
ing platform as to victory on the ath
letic field. We must get down to work
at once if Stanford is to sustain her
prestige
