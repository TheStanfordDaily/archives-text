Editor aily Palo Alto
Sir : The mal'ciousness of the meek
man who criticises in the lastSequoio the
action of one of our best football players
is worthy of much more condemnation
and scathing rebuke than the roughest
footbdl game could ever deserve. The
treatment of this player at the hands of
the Daily Palo Alto is also unjust.
The criticism which appeared on Mon
day ami in the last issue is the product
of malice and the outcome of personal
enmity. I consider that this continual
harping upon an occurrence which may
have been inexpedient but which was
wholly justified is the po <rest policy for
a paper endeavoring to represent gen
eral opinion. Vox PoWJLI.
