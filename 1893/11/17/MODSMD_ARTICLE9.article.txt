# Yesterdayâ€™s Football Practice
## 
### 
Claude Downing, Walton, and Coch
ran were unable to be out on the field
yesterday, and as the rest of the Var
sity team are all somewhat under the
weather, the game was not up to the
standard. J. K. Wilson played in Wal
ton's place, and the ends were supplied
by robbing the second eleven of their
two best men, Spalding and Leadbetter.
Considerable amusement was furnished
by Rutan and De Wolff, who got
through the line and took the ball from
Code, who was expecting "Whitehouse.
Of course a touch down was the result.
The playing of Kennedy was excel
lent and his two touch-downs from the
center of the field in ths start-off play
were given the applause merited.
Leadbetter and Spalding were invinci
ble on the ends. Ilarrelson, who played
in Frankcnheimer's place, did very well.
In tomorrow's game with the Olym
pics, Walton and Frankeuhcimer will
be unable to play. Wilson and Ilar
relson will probably play the halves;
Leadbetter and Spalding plav the ends.
