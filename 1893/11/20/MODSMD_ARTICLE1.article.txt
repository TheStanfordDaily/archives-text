# OLYMPICSIAGAINEDEFEATED
## Four Subs on Our Team, Heffelfinger Against Us, and We Are Scored on for the First Time this Season. Stanford 24—Olympics 11. 
### 
The Stanford men were already on
the field at Central Park, San Fran
cisco, last Saturday afternoid, when the
Olympics made their appearance. The
applause that greeted them showed at
once that most of the two thousand
spectators were Olympic sympathizers,
and that the mighty Ileftelfiuger was
receiving notice. Fora few mo.nents
the'o was a parley on the field, followed
by cries ot "play bill;" then Captain
Wilson explained to the grand stand
why his team objected to play against
the Berkeley cotch, who would be in a
position to gain information in regard
to our play which lie could use to the
advantage of the 11. C. team. Our team
retired to the side lines amid hisses
from the grand stand, and the matter
was arbitrated by members of the IJni
ve sity Club ilcffelfinger absolutely
refused to leave ;he team and said he
would play for spite, although the
O ynipies themselves desired him to re
tire; several Olympic men declared that
they ought to he ab'e to put up an
eleven of their own out of two thousa d
members. I lie committee decided
against us, and our men lined up against
the Olympics, who had the bail
In less than live minutes after the
start oft'from centre Stanford had not
only stopped the Olympic advance, but
had secured the ball, sent Lewis round
loft end well protected by interference,
scored a touchdown, and Whitehouse
had kicked the first one of his unfailing
goals. Again the Olympics took the
ball at, centre, and just seven minutes
later Whitehouse kicked another goal for
our team after Lewis had made the
touchdown. I he small contingent of
our Stanford students expressed
their appreciation in the most wildly
enthusiastic yells, and the grand stand
was silent. 11 efi'elfinger played every
where and used his enormous size arid
weight to great advantage, but even the
mighty 'Heft'" failed time and again to
break down our interference, given, to
a large extent, by the substitute back.4
Fraiikenbeimcr was slow in starling
but nothing short of the concentrated
taeklinir of several oppouents could stop
his wriggling, twisting, and crawling
gains even after he was downed. His
touchdown followed by a goal made us
eighteen points for the first half.
Our team started with the ball in
the second half and used the"V" from
which a smaller one sprouted when the

opponents struck the line; and twenty
yards were gained.
Miley had done occasional punting
in the first hall', but both Tobin and
Miley kicked down the field during this
half. Tobin repeatedly dropped back
from left end and drove the glistening
| pigskin far down the field by his mag
nificent punts. When the Olympics
I had the ball on our twenty-yard line
Tub u fell back fora kick. We knew
what was coming: we saw him make
a thirty-five yard drop kick on our cam
pus last jear. Half the team were al
most upon him as he dropped the ball
and kicked it straight between the posts,
not a foot above the cross bar.
The crowd went wild. The Olym
pics resurrected their long unheard yell.
"We've scored against Stanford" was the
j jubilant expression on all sides.
A. very unusual play, and one which
McMillan has long hoped to make, was
made by that reliable guard of ours.
Tobin caught McKay's punt, but Spal
ding and McMillan were upon him in
an instant. Spalding shot one of his
1 beautiful tackles into Tobin's thighs.
The sudden shock drove the ball in
the air, and McMillan fondly grasped it,
and never stopped until he sat on it
between the distant goal posts and
listened to the Stanford yells.
Tobin's drop kick was a beauty, but
such things are conceded to be un
avoidable when the ball is within kick
■ ing distance of an opponents' goal.
Right here it should be noticed that
Kansome cf the U. (J. has the reputation
of making three out of four drop kicks
!he attempts from the field. When
Morse went down the field on a forty
yards run without a Stanford man in
pursuit and made a touchdown we re
alized that our team was minus its three
j invincible backs.
11 effelfinger was battering ram, cat
; apult, pile driver, and all, for the team
which his individual play so materially
strengthened. The terrific tackle that
he took out of Ilarrelson, whom he out
weighs more than a hundred pounds
! brought forth the cry of "brutal" from
the spectators, hut it never dazed
I ' Bill)':'
The general expression wan that it
was a good game. No one was hurt,
| and there was no fighting.
