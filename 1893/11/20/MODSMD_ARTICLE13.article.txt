Our disappointment at the probable
failure of Hunt bei..g able to p ay next
Thanksgiving day, owing to the injur
ies he received last Saturday, has been
relieved by a notice in today's Exami
ner stating that his injuries are not very
serious, and that in all probability lie
will be in as good condition as ever in
a few days. It gives us pleasure to
notice this, and we congratulate Berke
ley men on the outcome of what was
thought to be a very serious injury.
