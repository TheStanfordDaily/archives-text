Our last preliminary game is played,
and there now remains but a week in
which to further develop and improve
the team. The mislortune which has
befalleu the Varsity team casts quite a
gloom over our prospects; and as there
is but a short time before the all-impor
tant game, affairs are assuming a ser
ious aspect. Four of our best men on
the sick-list and all the others in a
comatose state, is not a very encourag
ing outlook. Over-training has been
considered as the cause. If this is true,
a rest fora day or so would be of great
benefit to the team. It is to be hoped
that the few days rest given to the men
last week was of material beuofit to
them. One thing is sure —we must be
in perfect trim to meet U. C.
We wish it understood that wc have
no more confidence in our team now
than we had a month ago. We expect
them to win, but we know that it will not
be an easy victory. The game in Oak
land is not a safe criterion. The lie
liauce team have either improved won
derfully or else the University of Cal
ifornia are continuing their former pol
icy, deceiving the public. We think
it is the latter.
To repeat a former sentiment ex
pressed —over confidence on the part of
our players will render them incapable
of playing successfully iu adverse cir
cumstances
