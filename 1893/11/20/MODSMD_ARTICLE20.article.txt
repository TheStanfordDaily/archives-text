Editor of the Daily Palo Alto
'J'he individual who signs' himself
with the comprehensive noin <lr, plume
of "Vox Populi" in the last issue of
the Daily Palo Alto, is evidently
laboring under the medieval hallucina
tion that the function of the press is to
condole the weaknesses of "the powers
that be." A censorship of the press
has long ago been relegated to such
orthodox civilizations as Russia. In
telligent, sincere and fearless criticism,
when exercised by the press represent
atives of our University, will be sus
tained by the student factor in the ;
University's progress. The university ;
world offers no exception to the social
and political. To these the press offers
no remedy for their various ailments J
but through sinedfre criticism. A
daily or weekly lotion of press flattery
is no solace to the weak and vain "who i
sit on the tail of progress." ]Jut this
allopathic remedy is insipid even
though not harmful, to the vigorous,
earnest college student.
