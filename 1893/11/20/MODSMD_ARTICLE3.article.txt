Win. [lutit's address Sunday morn
ing was on "Rible tudy in College."
The object of a university is to teacb
the art of living and not the arts of life;
the Rible is a book of principles and
not of rules, and from it can we best
learn how to live. The study of the
Rible as a literary work is essential to a
well rounded education; it contains his
tory, pre try, ethics, philosophy, biogra
phy, and the basis of law. It is also
essential to the spiritual life of a student
which is apt to be neglected. It is dur
ing out university career that tastes are
formed, and if we neglect the study of
the Rible now we will come to lose all
taste for it. Further, one cannot re
concile science and philosophy with the
idea of the Rible as conceived when a
child; in order to do this we should give
it our maturer study.
