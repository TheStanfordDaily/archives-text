# FOR PURIFYING THE PRESS.
## Mrs. Mary Roberts Smith Interviewed 
### 
In an interview that a Daily Palo
Alto reporter had yesterday with Mrs.
.Mary R. Smith some very interesting
facts were learned concerning the late
movement for purifying the papers
Mrs. Smith was one of the speakers in
a mass meeting held in San Francisco
two weeks ago, and a woman of original
ideas on the subject of newspaper re
form. The substance of the interview
is given below.
The immediate cause of the present
movement for paper reform was caused
by the disgusting way in which the
papers exploited the details in the An
nie Gilmore case. This case gave the
women an opportunity for the move
ment as it concerned one of their sex,
and was a matter of interest to them.
Men were not asked to assist in the
movement for various re isons; the busi
ness and political interests of many men
are bound up, to u certain extent, in the
papers, and most men have no time. Thus
many cultured as well as wealthy wo
men took it into their hands to stir up
the papers, and to prvcnt the publica
tion of so many vile details. They
sought to be just in their criticism of
the papers and confine themselves to
sensationalism Three* private meet
ings were held at Miss Nest's school at
which a hundred prominent women
were present. No outsiders or reporters
were allowed at these meetings, and the
best means of getting the public support
were frankly discussed. The meetings
had two immediate results. 25,0U0
blanks, each holding fifty names, were
sent to public spirited women for their
signatures and that of their friends.
The second result was a public mass
meeting at Golden Gate Hall held
while the petitions were circulated.
Reporters were admitted, and all women
interested and not invited to the priv
ate meetings were given a chance to
attend and gain a knowledge of the
movement. This meeting was addressed
by a number of women from various local
ities. Mrs. Smith represented Stan
ford.
The addresses were given on differ
ent phases of newspaper reform, though
the one thing desired was the repres
sion of sensationalism, especially in
criminal cases; the meaning of the
sensationalism being the publication of
unnecusary and horrible details in mur
ders and immoral cases. Such cases
arc unfit for children to see, and the
women especially consider the effect of
papers on school boys and girls. The
addresses were thoughtful aud prac
tical Mrs Smith spoke on "The
newspaper as an advertiser." We may
perhaps, mention here the f.ict that
Mrs. Smith's address was given to
Mrs. I). J. Spencer in the publication
of the addroses in the Examiner.

The petitions sent out pot something
like 30,000 signatures aud have prob
ably been already handed in to the
editors of San Francisco papers. The
ladies have little hope that the papers
will be directly influenced, but they
hope individual newspaper men will
exert their influence lor better articles.
They hope also to create a public opin
ion that will demand a better paper.
Newspapers always retort to an appeal
by saying that the public are giveu
what they want, and this movement is
chiefly to foster the right kind of opin
ion on the part of the public.
A common remedy proposed by those
who have not studied the matter is sim
ply for those who don't like a paper to
stop taking it, and so reduce the sub
scription list. But as two-thirds of a
paper's income is derived from adver
tisements, and oue-third ouly from sub
scriptions, this is a very inadequate
remedy. The only hope of reform is to
continue the agitatiou of the matter aud
ereatc public sentiment. The petitions
are in, but that is not the end of the
movement. The women have definite
plans for bringing other influences to
bear.
One method of reform thought of is
to have all criminal news published on
a separate sheet, which people may
have or not as they choose. This
would speedily divide the supporters of
a paper into two classes. The San
Francisco clergymen were not invited
by the ladies to aid in the reform move
ment, but they took up the work on
their own account.
The ladies were treated with the
greatest respect by the press, except
where particular papers were unwisely
mentioned.
