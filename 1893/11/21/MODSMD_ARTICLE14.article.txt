Some of the Special students have
considered it their privilege to perfect
an organization. They have not borne
in mind, evidently, the fate of a similar
organization that once existed here, hut
which experience and the various regu
lar organizations, whose require
ments for membership are not so
exacting as to debar specials, rendered
not only impracticable but unnecessary.
Then too, like their once existing pre
decessors, they have chosen a mortar
board; so also have the Freshmen.
But that the members of eit, her organ
ization will ever be so foolish as to wear
them is beyond the beliet of the major
ity of student!?.
This is a community not differing in
many respects from the communities of
intelligent persons. That some ancient
custom founded upon the traditions of
conservative Oxford or Cambridge
should be mimicked here is a reproach
upon the broad-minded views of a
thoroughly modern university commun
ity. The mortar board and gown go
together. If the gown is not worn, and
it is not likely ever to be worn here,
then the mortar board should not be.
The decorated dilapidated grey
plug is a campus pleasantry more befit
ting the associations of the first year
students than those whose third year of
university education might be recognized
in no other way.
