In this age devoted to rapid money
making the average student goes to col
lege with but one idea; haid, long, and
severe cramming in some special course
by the aid of which he may in after
life obtain his bread and butter. The
dollars and cents of the future, and the
ease with which they may be acquired,
constitute the main, and, in some cases,
the whole incentive which impels him
to seek a thorough knowledge in his i
chosen profession.
Arriving at college and ignoring any
course of study that docs not in his
mind have a direct bearing upon his |
immediate success, his associations are ;
naturally confined to those found in his j
owu department. The need is then i

made apparent fora system of artificial
associations that will bring together all
classes that come to a university. Wo
venture to say that there are students
who have been here for two years past
and are .still unknown to each other.
If a person expects to derive that
power froui a college education which
will broaden his mind and ideas, he
should by no means neglect the social
side of life. The modern business man,
be he engineer or lawyer, who is prom
inently identified with society, gains
much in a business way from his ac
quaintances.
Let our young men take a deeper in
terest, then, in social events. Let us
have more receptions, class hops, and
social class meetings in gene al where
we may cultivate that taste ior culture
and refinement which characterizes the
truly educated man; instead of, hermit
like, devoting ourselves solely to our
twenty hours of history or science.
