# Special Students Organize.
## 
### 
The Special students had a well at
tended meeting yesterday for the pur
pose of organization. A committee was
appointed in order to draft a constitu
tion for the class, which will be reported
upon at the next meeting. As has
been done at previous meetings of Spec
ial students, mortar boards were adopted,
and a class color chosen. The unaui
mous wish of the meeting appeared to be
in favor of effecting a permanent organ
ization.
