Practicc yesterday was spirited and
well played. The Varsity is showing
up in form and if the improvement con
tinues it will be in good trim for the
Thanksgiving game. The second eleven
has made a great deal more improve
ment in proportion than the Varsity.
Last evening Andrade and Russell
bucked the line anu made some larsre
o
gains.
For the Varsity Kennedy played a
star game and bucked the line in good
shape. Harrelson, who tock Franken
heimer's place, played a fine ga;k*e.
Aided by Code, Waltou, and Kennedy,
he was carried from the centre of the
field in a"V" fora touchdown. Ilis
end runs were trood.
Walton made the prettiest run of the
day. Aided by excellent interfering of
Code and Kennedy he skirted the left
end fora touchdown. McMillan, Coch
pan, and Leadbctter showed up well.
Capt. Wilson did not play yesterday,
but assisted Bliss in coaching the team.
As the remaining practice days are now
few, it is to be hoped that a large crowd
will attend the 'games every evening.
This will be a great stimulus to the boys
who are to represent Stanford in the
coming struggle.
