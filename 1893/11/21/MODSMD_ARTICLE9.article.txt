# What is a Fellowship.
## 
### 
In England it means about the high
est honor and position of greatest re
sponsibility connected with the college
or university. A fellow ranks higher
than a member of the faculty; is a
member of the corporation, and with
his fellows helps'to make up the man
aging board. lie is a sort of regent
and faculty member combined, and
only attains his high position after a
thorough test of worthiness. In Amer
ica the fellow is an altogether different
dignitary. Ife has no voice in faculty
meetings, and is looked upon as a kind
of post graduate, encouraged in taking
up advanced work by a stipulated sum
to meet expenses while engaged. It is
interesting to know that fellows in
Yale or Harvard are allowed to do no
instructing. The student's whole time
is supposed to be taken up in research
and he is never allowed to teach with
out special permission of the faculty.
