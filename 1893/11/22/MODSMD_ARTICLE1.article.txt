# C. N. LITTLE.
## Professor of Pure Mathematics. 
### 
In lilting the important position in
the depaitment of mathematics made
vacant by the "call ,of Prof. Joseph
Swain to the presidency of the Univer
sity of Indiana, Pres. Jordan has again
shown his good judgment by tire ap
pointment of Prof. (J. N. Little.
Prof. Little is the son of a missionary,
and was born at Madura, southern I
India, in the year 1858. When he was]
one year old his parents returned to j
this country, where the family has re-1
mained ever since. At the age of
seventeen he entered the University of
Nebraska, aud in 1879 obtained the
degree of A. B. Throughout his col
lege course he was distinguished above
others for his ability in mathematics.
The same success followed him at the
Institute of Mathematics and Civil En
gineering, and afterwards at Yale, where
ho received the degree Ph. 1). in 1885.
He was then made associate professor of
civil engineering at his a/ma mater,
the University of Nebraska, and in
188'.) obtained the full professorship in
that department. Owing to the tho
roughness of the work done in his de
partment the graduates immediately
found good positions, and as a conse
quence the department came to be
recognized as one of the strongest of its
kind in the middle western states. In
the spring of 1893 he was elected to
the chair of pure mathematics in the
University of Nebraska, but befort
entering upon his duties lie accepted
his present position as profess r of pure
mathematics. With the co-operation
of so noted a scholar as Prof. Allardice
and of the other members of the depart
ment, Stanford's department of mathe
matics will doubtless be advanced until
it is second to that of no other univer
sity in the country.
The a r ticles Prof. Little has contri
buted to the press have placed him in
the front rank of American mathema
ticians. His doctor's thesis, "Knots,
with a census for order ten," is on a
subject treated before by but two or
three men, an 112 its publication in the
"Transactions of the Conneticut Asso
ciation" anticipated by only a few days
the famous English mathematician,
Tait, who had been engaged on the
same problem. This led to correspond
cnce and co-operation between the two
gentlemen, and Tait withdrew from the
line of investigaiion Miontimipd. in favor
of Prof Little. This production was
followed by "Notes on spaec divisions,"
accomplished with- the co-operation of
Prof. K 11. Moore, who is now profes
sor of mathematics in the University of
Chicago. It was published in the
"American .Journal of Mathematics "
Next appeared "Non-alternate 1 knots
of orders eight and nine." The publi
cation of it in the "Transactions of the

Royal Society of Edinburgh," vol.
XVIII., was an liouor granted to but
few Americans up to that time. His
next work, "Knots of eleven crossings,"
also appeared in the "Transactions of
the Royal Society of Edinburgh," vol.
XX. " Brief notes on geometric theor
ems," his recent publication in the
"American Journal of Mathematics,"
has received great approval by author
ities of mathematics.
The record of Prof. Little is sufficient
to show that he is a man of both genius
and energy,and that he is a valuable ac
quisition to our faculty. The extent to
which he was appreciated at the Uni
versity of Nebraska may be seen by a
letter from Chancellor Can field to Pres
ident Jordan, in which he humorously
calls him "an instructional thief of the
worst type." The writer further adds
that he does not know what the Uni
versity of Nebraska will do if Dr. Jor
dan keeps "drugging away the best
men" that it has.
