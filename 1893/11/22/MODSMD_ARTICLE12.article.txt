The managers of the Midwinter Ex
position have set aside an evening for
each of the universities and leading
high schools of the coast.
On the Stanford evening the building
will be dccorated with cardinal, our yell
will be heard on all sides, and our
many friends will wear the 'University
colors. In short, everything possible
will be done to make the overrng rep
resentative of this university.
A very carefully arranged program
should be carried out, or some small in
stitution, that has worked hard for the
occasion, will appear to better advantage
before the crowd visiting the exposi
tion. Of course, our Glee Club should
sing and our Military Hand furnish
music during the evening. To obtain
the rest of the program, let the students
take hold of the matter and get up
something worthy of our University.
