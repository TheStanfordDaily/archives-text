# The
						Undergraduate Rule.

### 
The undergraduate rule which pro
duced so much talk last year has been
condemned. The Harvard Crimson in
an editoral makes the following state
ment:
The undergraduate rule made the col
lege, not the university, the unit in ath
letics. It tended to break the bonds of
the university; it ignored the fact of
university development, in this country
and expected Pennsylvania and Prince
ton and Harvard universities would be
content to be represented by Pennsyl
vania and Princeton and Harvard col
leges. It was evident also that the
undergraduate rule meant curtailment
of the possibilities of amateur sport, and
that such a curtailment was unneces
sary; a bona fide student—one doing
some real work with some definite degree
as his object—is to be weleomed,
whether from college or professional
school. Amateur sport wants only men
above reproach, but it wants all these
attainable.
