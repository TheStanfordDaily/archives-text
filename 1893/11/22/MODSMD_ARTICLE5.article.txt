# â€™97 MEETING.
## Mortarboards Abandoned and a Yell Chosen. 
### 
The Class of '97 met this afternoon
and rescinded the order for blue mor
tarboards which some of its members
had hoped to wear at the Thanksgiving
game. The San Jose hatter who had
come up to take measurements returned
wondering at the sudden change in the
opinions of the class. Something de
cidedly different in style and language
from the other class yells was adopted.
Here it is:
Ilipta Ki Enanakonta!
'97! Rah! Rah! Rah!
Suspend judgment until you hear it
yelled.
