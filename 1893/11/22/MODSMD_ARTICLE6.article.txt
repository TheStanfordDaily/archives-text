# The
						Varsity's Last Week.
## 
### 
The Varsity is getting down to good
work and by the end of the week will
be in excellent condition. The practice
games are getting better every day and
far more interesting. More spectators
are on the held every day, and their en
thusiasm is clearly manifest from the
encouragement given both trains by ap
plause and individual salutations. It is
a great pity that this support was not
given sooner, but even at this late hour
it will prove of great benefit to the
team It shows that Stanford has con
fidence in her team, laudable to what
ever degree it might be placed.
Yesterday's praciice brought out a
pood many important, facts. It showed
that a little more general improvement
is needed: that the men must be quicker
in getting into line, and that the individ
ual playing of two or three of the men
must be improved, Kennedy showed
that he cannot make a drop kick. This
is a matter of more importance than at
first appears. Many a game lias been
won by a drop kick when time is not
sufficient to admit of other modes of
play. The Portland team whom Stan
ford is to play on New Year's day won
their last game by a well delivered drop
kick.
Walton, Paul Downing, McMillan,
Cochran, Code, and Claude Downing
put up their usual good game yesterday
and their playing deserves no adverse
criticism.
The second eleven played an excel
lent game, but were too slow in lining
up. Leadbetter was very strong at
right end. Jack Reynolds is con
stantly improving in his playing, and
yesterday made a very neat tackle on
Kennedy. The line men were excep
tionally strong. They resisted the re
peated "bucks" of Walton and Kennedy
with better successcs than ueual. If
the second team would only line up
quicker they would undoubtedly play a
much better game against the Varsity.
Berkeley has the reputation of having
quick players, and if the Varsity could
get practice against a quick-playing
team it would be of great benefit to them.
