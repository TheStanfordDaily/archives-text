# Educational Congress of the World's Fair.
## 
### 
It is well known that Prof. Earl
Barnes took a very active part in the
Educational Congress at the World's
Fair, lie read six papers before the
various congresses. [lis paper on
"Theological ideas of California child
ren" attracted wide attention, both from
the interesting data presented and from
his original mode of investigation.
There were two sessions of the Edu
cational Congress The women's aux
iliary of Chicago organized the first
congress, the National Educational
Association held the second. These
congresses were divided iuto sub-con
g<esses covering every department of
human thought. For the first time in
history a permanent association was
organized for the study of children.
Prof. Barnes is president of this as
sociation for the first year. He is now
preparing a preliminary circular relat
ing to the work of the association.
Foreign meetings were well repre
sented at these congresses. The large
representation from South American
states was noticeable. Most of the
meetings were thronged with people
eager to learn what was going on in the
educational world. The children's
drawings attracted wide-spread atten
tion.
The congress of higher education
was very interesting, the most impor
tant discussion being on the entrance
requirements for colleges. There was
a general agreement of the eastern col
leges that a boy was not tit to enter
college unless he had a thorough prep
aration in Greek and Latin. Pres.
Jordan stood entirely alone in contend
ing that, though Creek and Latin were
excellent for training, there were other
tilings equally valuable, and that the
time had come to give every man the
best line of opportunity.
The most interesting of all the con
gresses were those devoted to the defec
tive classes, the deaf, the blind, etc.
It is significant that the needs of these
unfortunate classes are receiving
the careful attention of the best thought
of the age.
One of the great benefits of the
Educational Congresses was the social
feature, giving one an opportunity to
become acquainted with the representa
tive men and women of the age; an
other was it they brought to the
front the new and attractive features of
S education; and a third was that new
ideas were subjected to the criticism of
people capable of passing judgment
! on them.
