# YOSEMITE VALLEY.
## Lecture Tuesday Evening by Dr. A J. Frost. 
### 
There are two ways in which the Yo
semite Valley tuay be reached; one, the
more travelled, called the Mariposa
route, and the second, the Calavaras
route. From Sacramento by the Cal
avaras route is six days' journey. The
valley itself is about seven miles long,
and from one half to three fourths of a
mile wide, with its floor four thousand
feet above the sea.
The first object of interest that at
tract 1 ) one's attention upon entering
from the Calaveras route is the Bridal
Veil Falls upon the right. They are
two hundred feet wide at the top and
fall at one mighty leap nine hundred
feet to the valley below. The water as
it conies down does not seeui to be fall
ing but rather crawling, now sweeping
in air an instant with retarded motion,
now sweeping slowly down. It has the
appearance of an immense veil, which
is sometimes broken entiielv in two by
a violent gust of wind, letting the bot
tom fall but folding the top fora mo
ment back upon the dark granite cliff
behind. In midsummer rainbows are
innumerable. The one that crowns the
brow of the niouutain is especially beau
tiful near sunset.
On the opposite side is El Capitan, a
mountain of solid grauite without a
11 iw or crack, that raises itself perpen
dicularly three thousand three hundred
and six feet above the floor of the val
ley. One standing before it has to lean
backward for his sight to rest upon the
mighty giant It is probably the larg
est rock upon our planet. Its face is
perfectly smooth and is one hundred
and seventy-five acres in extent. The
top of the mountain is covered with
laurel.
About a half mile up the valley are
the Three Graces and above them Ca
thedral Spire, an immense rock two
thousand feet high, with one spire five
hundred feet high on one end and an
incomplete one still higher ou the
other. It looks like an unfinished
minster of the old world. Opposite
this rock are the Three Brothers, all
between thirty-six and thirty-eight
hundred feet, in height. The highest
is called Eagle's Peak, because it is the
favorite eyrie for eagles The moun
tains derive their name not from their
similarity of appearance but from the
fact that throe Indian brothers met
their death in these mountain fastnesses.
Further up the valley, again, stands
the majestic Sentinel Rock, whose sharp
pointed top i* over three thousand feet
above its base. Only one person has
ever set foot upon its top, and that was
a woman. Alone she crawled up and
planted the stars and stripes on the
summit.

Going across the valley once more,
the Yosemite Falls, the highest in the
world, are seen. The Merced lliver
here makes* leap of six
teen hundred feet, Hows a short dis
tance, drops five hundred feet more,
runs a still shorter distance, and again
drops live hundred feet; besides which
the channel that the river has cut in
the mountain where it takes the initial
plunge is a thousand feet down. The
sound produced by the fall of this im
mense amount of water is as if iron
hail were being poured from the
heavens. Behind the falls is the Cave
of Winds, which is accessible only
when the wind sways the water from
its mouth. During the wiuter a cone
of ice a half acre in extent and five hun
dred feet high is formed at the top
fall. The cone is hollow, the water
falling inside af it.
Passing now up the valley four miles
from the entrance, Glacier Poiut is
reached. The trail up this rock is four
and a half miles long, and the ascent
occupies over four hours. Only one
level place is found on the entire trail
and that is called Union Point, because
here one can get a view of the whole
valley. Vernal Falls, Nevada Falls,
Half Dome, North Dome, lloyal Arch,
Indian I'eak, and the other monuments
of nature already mentioned are spread
out in one panorama. The master of
five hundred languages, with the elo
quence of an archangel, could not de
scribe the magnificence of the scene.
The summit of Glacier Point is 3400
feet in the heavens. A rock dropped
will j:o out of sight; apparently it
never strikes.
Going up the Merced River, which
falls two thousand feet in two miles, and
passing two spots charming for their
beauty, the Cascade of Diamonds and
the Silver Apron, .one sees the river
leaping down four hundred feet at Ver
nal Kalls'and seven hundred feet again at
Nevada Falls.
On the left of the river stands South
Half Dome towering five thousand feet
in the air. At its base is Mirror Lake,
as clear as glass. At sunrise one can
see the sun shining on the mountain
five thousand feet above him, and look
ing into the lake he sees dow u , down,
till another five thousand feet have been
traversed, the same sight inverted.
There are three the tries as to the
formation of the valley: that it was
caused by water, that the floor of the
valley dropped down in an earthquake,
that glaciers chi eUd it out. The last
is probably the correct theory.
Contrary to popular rumor there are
no Sequoias or (, big trees" in the valley,
but there are many beautiful flowers
and as a fernery it is unexcelled. No
where will we find such a galaxy of won
ders and works of nature. It is the mas
terpiece of the Almighty's workman
ship on this planet.
