It seems curious that the men board
ing in Encina Ilall should persist, when
ever strangers appear at :he dining
room door, to clap their hands and
stamp their feet like the gallery gods in
a ten cent theatre. Such an act not
only embarrasses the stranger who looks
in but is very discourteous as well, and
deserves the hisses which always come
from a part of the boarders.
Performances of this kind do not
help to spread the good name of the
University, and it is to be hoped that a
repetition of yesterday's performance
will not recur.
