Aoain we lmve been asked, "Why
don't the co-ed.a come out and watch
the football practice?" The reason they
do not come out so numerously as they
did last year is obvious. There is no
inducement for them to turn out. To
be sure, the management has done
everything in its power t<> accommo
date all ladies who might appear on the
grounds by having some benches made
and placed at their disposal. Night
after night, however, a certain crowd
of spectators seem to make it a point tn
crowd themselves in front of everyone â– 
else and there stand throughout the!
practice, obstructing the view of all
who may desire to take scats,
It would only be a display of good I

taste if the crowd would give the ladies
a chance to see the team piny, and we
would suggest that they confine them
selves to the north side of the field
only, if they are not satisfied with their
own share of the room on the south
side.
