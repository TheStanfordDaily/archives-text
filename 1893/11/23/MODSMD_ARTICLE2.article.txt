# Last Night's Play.
## 
### 
A large and enthusiastic crowd was
on the campus yesterday and a dormant
enthusiasm showed its first signs of
awakening in the encouraging shouts
and exuberance manifested in the col
lege yell. Started by that typical col
lege man, with whose name we are all
familiar, the college yell was passed
along the line until everyone had caught
the inspiration, aud the Stanford yell
greeted every play, for they were all
excellent, and the reverberating echoes
brought back to theui the responding
toot of a distant locomotive, causing a
fresh outburst of vocal demonstration.
The players themselves seemed to be
greatly encouraged by the interest taken
and every man played football for all
that was in him. Kennedy especially
distinguished himself; and when he
made his great run from the centre of
the field, and by his elusive dodging
tore through the line fora touch-down,
everyone yelled till he was hoarse.
"Doc" Ilall, who took Cochran's place
at left tackle, played a star game and
his tackling was one of the features.
Frankenheimer, aided by Code, unde
a beautiful run of forty yards before he
was brought to the ground. Walton
continued his good playing. Leadbet
ter, on the second team, played an ex
cellent game on the end, aud Tracy
Russell's work was exceptionally fine.
Jack Reynolds played a strong game,
and McKay punted well.
Never has a team worked more faith
fully than the Varsity. Every man
has made it his object to improve him
self as much as possible, knowing that
in this way the team as a whole would
be greatly strengthened. That they
have accomplished this, let next Thurs
day's game decide.
