# An Interview with a Prominent Visitor
## 
### 
Dr. Stewart of Africa, who visited
the University yesterday, was inter
viewed by a reporter who obtained from
him some very interesting particulars
about his work and African affairs gen
erally. He has just returned from a
trip in the northwest and thinks, from
what he has seen, that the treatment of
the Indians in Canada compares very
favorably with that of the blacks iu
Africa.
In speaking of the future develop
ment of central and southern Africa the
doctor said that the latter alone will be
the point toward which European col
onization will tend. Formerly the
southern part of the country was
thought to be only a huge hunting
ground for big game; but now, as it has
been discovered to abound iu mineral
wealth as well, it is attracting the at
tention of miners. He says that although
he would not recommend a rich man to
go there, yet there is a great field for
those who are acquainted with mining
or who are able to take charge of min
ing operations.
