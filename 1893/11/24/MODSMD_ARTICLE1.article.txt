The playing of the teams has become
a matter of so much interest to the
spectators of late that time is called be
fore they are aware. The largest crowd
of the season witnessed the game yester
day, and almost as much enthusiam as
ou the previous day was shown by die
lookers-on. One thing noticeable in
yesterday's game was the applause given
to the players by the young ladies. In
one instance in particular there was a
half suppressed murmur of excitement
from the young ladies' side. The "oh,
oil's" had a soft musical ring immensely
pleasing to the ear and in marked con
trast to the vocifcrous salutes of
"Jack's" squad of hooters.
Cochran's place was filled by "Hoc"
Hall, whose playing was, if anything,
better than that of the former day. His
work during the week has given him a
place amongst the best, and it looks
now as if his services might be called
into play for the big game Code's ab
sence was clearly felt, and his value to
the team was singularly evident to all.
Happily he will be back in time for to
morrow's game.
It was impossible to keep the first
team from breaking through and spoil
ing the passes; so that the team did not
show up as well as usual. Kennedy
again repeated his brilliant play of the
former day, distinguishing himself
more than ever. Walton interfered
well aÂ»,d made some good ruus.
The tackling of all the men was ex
cellent and hard. McKay and Mc-
Guire were considerably jarred and
twisted by Claude Downing and Spald
ing.
A short resume of the week's
work shows that the playing has been
steadily improving. The change of
quarters for the training table undoubt
edly accounts for much of this. The
University owes a vote of thanks to the
gentlemen who so kindly offered their
house to the football men. In fact
Capt. Wilson and Manager Maytiard
have done everything in their power to
make football a success in every par
ticular. Mr. Bliss's coaching cannot
be improved upon atul, much credit is
duo him for the excellent team which
Stanford will send to San Francisco on
Thursday next to defend the cardinal, as
yet unpolluted by I he stigma of defeat.
