The associated students at the State
University held the most largely at
tended meeting in its history yesterday
afternoon. Pres. Kellogg and Profes
sor Gayley addressed the meeting. The
matter of enlarging the Choral Union
was discussed. It is intended that the
membership be increased to 250 and
that some grand work will be produced
in commencement week, as an oratorio.
The question of how to prevent
cheating in examinations was also taken
up. It was decided that each exami
nation paper should be headed by a
pledge that no help had been given or
received by the student handing it in.
However, the students defeated a reso
lution to have a committee to spy out
cases of cheating and to decide upon the
mode of punishing guilty persons.
