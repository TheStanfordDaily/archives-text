An innovation has been made at De
land Stanford University which is com
mendable, in the reception given by the
sophomore class to the freshmen. The
old idea that these two classes are
by na'ure hostile to each other is fast
giving away to that fraternal feeling
which should exist between all classes
and departments of a great university.
Why, at this, the greatest university of
the west, cannot the sophomore class
lay aside all petty prejudices and follow
the noble precedent set by our contem
porary in the far west? By so doing
one step would be taken which, if fol
lowed by succeeding classes would rid
us of the last vestige of class discrimi
nations which are fast giving way be
fore the liberalizing movements of the
aiic in which we live.
