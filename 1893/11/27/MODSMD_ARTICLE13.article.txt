# Another Sorority at Stanford.
## 
### 
Saturday evening witnessed the ad
vent of a new sorority at Stanford.
Lambda Alpha iMu established its Cal
ifornia Alpha chapter. This sorority
differs from other Greek letter societies
in that members of other sororities are
eligible to membership. The spirit how
ever is very conservative, the number
of chapters and the membership both
being limited.
The charter members are the Misses
A.nna Lena Lewis, Harriet A. Nichols,
and Blanche May Freeman; pledged:
Misses Lucile and Harriet Eaves. Their
pin is a neat little silver triangle, and
their colors are sage-green and lavender.
