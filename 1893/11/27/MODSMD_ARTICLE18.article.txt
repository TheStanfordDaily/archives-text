In accordance with recommendations
made in these columns not since,
the Alpha literary society, at its last
meeting, passed a resolution to take
steps toward the formation of a debat
ing league which will include Euphro
nia and the Liw Debating Society. It
is to be hoped that the two societies
named will enter heartily into this
matter and that everything will be done
to make the league a success. The
inter-society debates will do good work
in training men for the inter-collegiate
debate which is to take place in the
spring.
