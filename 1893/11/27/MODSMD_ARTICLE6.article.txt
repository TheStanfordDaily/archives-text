# Sermon by Rev. Mr. Briggs of Los Gatos.

"Ts it possible that any good thing
can come out of Nazareth?" '-Come
and see." rp he Nazarenes, as a people,
were despised by the Philistines, and
this question of Nathaniel's was a nat
ural one.
All the great movements that we
caunot understand, in the physical as
well as in the spiritual world, spring
from small beginnings. G l hrist com
menced his life on earth as a lowly
carpenter's son but although he lived
only thirty-three years, he sent forth
the gospel with a power that has over
come all obstacles. To be sure, the
Christian nations today are sinful, but
that fact only serves to make the ray of
hope shine more brightly, for the world
is every day coming closer to the word
of Christ.
Philip's answer, and see,"
meant that we must enter into sym
pathy with Christ; we must see him as
our opersonal Savior before we can
understand all the good things that
have come out of Nazareth.
