# THE 						BAND WILL PLAY AT THE GAME.
## The 						Students's Association Will Help Defray Expenses. 
### 
It has finally been decided that the
Hand will attend the game on Thurs
day and lend its strength to victory.
At a meeting of the Associated Students
today, the sum of thirty dollars was
donated to help defray the expenses of
the Band.
Before the special train leaves the
campus the Band will render a few
appropriate selections and will probably
play at stations on the way. On ar
riving at the Valencia street station a
car or bus will be in waiting, and the
Band will lead the procession down
Market street as far as the Palace Ho
tel. On re-assembling before the game
the Band will accompany the team to
the Haight street grounds and escort
them to the field. Should victory be
ours, all Stanford students and sympa
thizers are urgently requested to meet
at the corner of Haight and Market
streets directly after the game, where
a line will be formed, headed by the
Hand playing the new Stanford songs.
The processiou will march through the
principal thoroughfares of the city.
