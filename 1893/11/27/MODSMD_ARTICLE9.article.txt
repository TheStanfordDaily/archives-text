# Football Practice.
## 
### 
In view of the proximity of the great
game, the practice on Friday and Sat
urday was anything but encouraging
Many of the regular players were ab
sent and among the number were sev
eral from the Varsity, and consequently
the playing was weak and ineffective.
On Friday evening the second team
scored on the Varsity for the first time
in weeks. The general apathy and in
difference to improvement displayed by
the candidates in general, although
partially pardonable on account of the
threatening weather, is almost inexcus
able when we know that only one more
day of practice intervenes betweeu now
and Thursday's game.
The Saturday's game was a little bet
ter than that of Friday, but the captain
was compelled to wait an hour before
he could get men enough to begin prac
tice. This ''don't care" spirit is bound
to result in ignominious defeat and
nothing less.
The play was very good considering
the fact that on both teams there were
several substitute men. "Doc" Ilall
put up a good game at tackle and de
monstrated that we have a good sub
stitute for that position should either of
the regulars be laid up. The other
men played their usual game, except
all seemed to share in the general in
difference.
