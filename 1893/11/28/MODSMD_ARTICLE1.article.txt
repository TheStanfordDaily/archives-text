He took his preparatory course in the
Hamilton Collegiate Institute. At the
age of seventeen lie entered the Univer
sity of Toronto, which was presided over
by the late Sir Daniel Wilson. In 1883
he graduated from that institution with
the degree of A. 8., and immediately
afterwards received a fellowship. Af
ter teaching for two years in the Brock
ville Collegiate Institute, he returned
to h.is alma mater and received the
degree of A. M in 188(3. He then
went to Johns Hopkins University,
where lie distinguished himself in Latin
and Greek, and, by competitive exami
nations in which he stood first, won a
scholarship. Afterwards he and I'ro
lessor Murray, who is now at the head
of our department of Greek, were
elected at the same time to the two fel
lowships in Greek.
In ISSB he left Johns Hopkins and
was appointed to a lectureship in Greek
and ancient history in University Col
lege at Toronto. This position he held
for the four years previous to coming
here to accept his present position,
except one semester, during which he
taught in Whetham College. Not
liking his position in the last named
institution he left it, and was immedi
ately called back to his old position in
Toronto.
Prof. Fairclough is a member of the
Canadian Institute, for which he has
prepared several papers. These articles
have appeared from time to time in the
Transactions of the Canadian Institute.
His other writings have been chiefly
educational papers.
Besides the fact that l'rof. Fair
clough has a wife aud little daughter
wlio will be here about Christmas, it
will doubtless be interesting to many to
know that Mrs. Fairclough is a sister of
Grant Allen, the famous scientist and
novelist, some of whose writings are in
our library.
