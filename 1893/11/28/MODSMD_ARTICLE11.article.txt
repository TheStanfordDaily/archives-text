# Another Football Song.

Tune, "My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean."
Our victims are over at Berkeley,
Our victims lie over the bay;
Our victims are over at Berkeley—
Oh! how we did do them today!
chorus:
Stanford! Stanford! In everything
we lead, we lead.
Stanford! Stanford! We're proud
of our college, indeed.
Oh! Stanford again is the victor.
llow nobly our boys did play!
Oh! Stanford again is the victor.
What think you Heff. now has
to say?
Were the Berkeley men in it a
minute?
Do you think they were in it
at all?
Stanford just descended upon them
And gave them another big fall.
Then let them hie back to Berkeley
To drape their gold and their blue,
While we to our undaunted card'nal
Shall ever be staunch and true.
