Ouk practice is over. Tomorrow the
noble lot of young fellows who are to
represent us in the great struggle for the
college championship will have left for
San Fraucisco to spend a day and niglit
there of perfect quiet before the grand
finale. That they have labored long
and well to attain perfection is recog
nized by all, and their earnest efforts in
behalf of our dearly loved alma mater
have gained for themselves a place in
everyone's heart. We are proud of our
team. Never have we sent forth a
more loyal set of champions, and one in
which we could place so much confi
dence.
In saying that we desire them to win,
we but voice the sentiment of every
student., professor, and supporter of
Stanford. In the beginning of the
year our prospects were far from favor
able; but, thanks to the determined am!
self-sacrificing work of Captain Wilson
and Manager Maynard, we have now a
team which would be a crcdit to any
college in the country. These gentle
men have left nothing undone to make
the team a representative one. The efforts
of Mr. Bliss, also, are worthy of the
greatest praise, and prove him to be a
very efficient coach.
