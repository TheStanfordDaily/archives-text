Cornell University has been given
two line libraries, one on the Gvrtuau
philosopher Kant of 1,000 volumes, the
other of 500 volumes ou Spinoza.
At Cornell a committee of nine mem
bers of the faculty arc discussing the
advisability of abolishing the decrees
of Ph. H. and 13. L. Great interest is
felt in the outcome, as such a change
would practically abolish Greek as a
requirement for the degree A. B.
The Ural nils College Bulletin says
there are five main lines along which a
student's work should run These are
stu'ly, reading, society work, college
politics, and athletics. As a rule most
students follow but one, two, or three
at most, of these, and the result is that
we find many students who arc scholars,
book-worms,speakers, politicians, or ath
letes, but few to whom ail these terms
may be applied. These few have fully
realized the benefits which a collcge is
supposed to give.
