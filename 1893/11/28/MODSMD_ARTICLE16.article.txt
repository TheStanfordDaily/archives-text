The statistics of Harvard University
are out. In the whole university there
are 8,001 students, as compared with
2,900 last year. The total in college is
1,64.S as to 1,508 last term. The net
gain is 92. The graduate department
and the Lawrence Scientific School
show the greatest gains. There are now
285 graduates to 200 in 1892-93. The
Medical Hchool, without the graduates,
numbers 404, showing a loss of 47.
This is accounted for by the advanced
standard for admission, and also the
requirement of four years' attendance
instead of three.
