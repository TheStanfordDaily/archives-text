# American School at Athens.
## 
### 
The American School at Athens, a
branch of the Archaeological Institute
of America, was founded at Athens in
ISB2. The school is now conducted by
an independent managing committee,
which is composed of representatives
from the American colleges which sup
port the school. The relations of the
school to the American educational
system are not local or limited, but
varied and general, as there are about
twenty of these colleges furnishing sup
port.
Unlike the German and French
Schools in Greece, the American School
depends entirely upon the assistance re
ceived from the supporting colleges and
their friends. In return for their sub

scriptions the colleges represented have
the privilege of sending their graduates
to the school, where they receive lodg
ing and instruction free of charge. The
endowmeut now amounts to 850,000,
but at least $10l),000 is needed to carry
on the work to the best advantage. The
American students for the most part are
not so thoroughly prepared for their
work on going to Athens as those from
France and Germany, and a special
course of lectures is provided to give
them a better understanding of the sub
ject. The director of the school,
Prof. Richardson, Yale '00, and this
year Professor White of Harvard and
Dr. Waldstein of Cambridge, England,
lecture on the general and special as
pects of the collections in the Greek
museums, and on topography and epi
graphy. The students take particular
classes of objects, slabs, vases, reliefs,
or inscriptions, work them up and make
reports upon them before the school.
Tne American School has not been
content to use the material furnished in
the Grecian museum, without trying
to add to their riches. Every year
some time is spent in excavating, and
the school has been rewarded by inter
esting and important discoveries. Ex
cavations have been conducted in suc
cessive years at Ticyon, learia, Plataea,
Eretria and Argos. The site of Icaria
was determined, an 1 a considerable
number of interesting sculptures ard
insc iptions was found there. Models
of these are to be made and will be sent
to New York. Mr. Browuson, Yale
'87, who is now a Freshman Instructo r
in Greek, spent two years in Greece, at
work in c nnection with the school.
He took a prominent part in the ex
cavations at Ilcraeum near Ar<ros, in
which many noteworthy discoveries
were made Ilenry S. Washington,
Yale 'SO, has for several years past
spent some months in Greece, and has
both furnished money for excavations
by the school and has done some suc
cessful work on his own account.
The school has been established more
than ten year.-!, and has commanded in
that time the services of some of the
most eminent American scholars, who
have acted as its direc.ors and profes
sors. Its students occupy responsible
positions as teachers and professors in
schools and colleges in eighteen differ
ent states in the Uniou. Perhaps there
is no enterprise of American colleges
wh'cli does so much good with so small
outlay of money. About 850,000 is
still needed fur the complete endow
ment of the school.
