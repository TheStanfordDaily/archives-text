and tired, lie ate a hearty dinner,
however, and shortly afterwards repaired
to his room. About &eveu o'clock he
was taken with a slight hemorrhage, and
an hour later a physician was called.

physician was again summoned, but to
no purpose. The patient lingered until
three o'clock this morning when death
relieved his suffering.

tions of respect and sympathy to his be
