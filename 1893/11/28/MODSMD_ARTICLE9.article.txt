Editor of the Daily Palo Alto.
It appears that considerable mis
understanding has arisen from a state
ment in the Daily Palo Alto of Nov.
27th in regard to a new Sorority,
Lambda Alpha Mu. Some unknown
individual of ingenious turn of mind
contrived the whole affair with abso
lutely no foundation whatsoever, and
such person had no authority to publish
such an article.
Signed—Anna Lena Lewis,
llauriet A. Nichols,

[The lateness of the hour when the
article referred to was read, and the
presumable reliability of its source, pre
vented usual verification of copy. A
contemptible juke has been perpetrated,
not only upon the young ladies con
cerned, but upon this paper and its
readers. For our future interests we
will make an effort to ascertain who
wrote the article, that we may know
whom to consider untrustworthy. —
