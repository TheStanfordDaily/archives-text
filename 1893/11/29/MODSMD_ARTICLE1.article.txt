# OFF FOR THE BATTLE FIELD
## Our Boys Will Be Seen No More Till They Line Up Thursday Afternoon. All the Men Except Wilson and Cochran Are in Good Condition, but Both Will Probably Play. 
### 
The finest football eleven that Stan
ford has ever had will leave for the city
today on the flyer, there to take a well
earned rest before the mighty struggle
on Thanksgiving. The men are all in
the pink of condition except Wilson
and Cochran Wilson has played very
little since the last Olympic game, and
owing to an injured side it would not be
surprising to see him give way to Spal
ding before the game is over. Cochran
has a sprained foot, and has not been
playing since last Tuesday, It is doubt
ful if he will be able to play at all, and
if he does he will require a great deal
of grit to keep in the game.
P. M. Downing, at centre, needs no
mention here. His hard, clean work
ou the field, and his great head work
have placed him in the enviable posit
ion of beiug undoubtedly the best cen
tre rush on the coast.
McMillan, the only freshman capable
of making the team, is putting up an
exceptionally fine game at left guard.
It is almost impossible to throw him off
his feet, and Berkeley will find him a
stone wall.
Burnett, at right guard, is the heavi
est man on the team He is power!ul
and keeps cool, but he lacks the anima
tion necessary for an ideal guard. He
is over six "feet tall.
Whitehouse received a thorough
training last year as centre on the
second eleven, and tho result of this is
strongly shown in the work done by him
this season at tackle. He is a hard,
sure tackier, and runs powerfully with
the ball.
Cochran is one of the hardest players
01 the team. He, like Kennedy and
Frankenhetnier, has not, however, been
working very hard since Berkeley was
defeated two weeks ago. This fact is
clearly shown in the play of the three
men. Cochran is an old timer on the
football field, and takes advantage of
every opportunity to gain ground. Last
year he withstood every rmh of the
mighty Hunt, against his quarter of the
line.
C. Downing and Wilson, on the ends,
play a very similar game. They are
both sure faeklers and can pound
through very heavy interference.
Berkeley will find it hard to pass them
if they play the game of which they are
capable.
Code is built for an ideal quarter; is

cool and passes the ball clearly and truly
and interferes splendid'y. He always
puts up his best game agaiust Berkeley
and nothing need be feared of him.
Walton and Frankenheimer are work
ing tolerably well together as half-backs.
Walton does the best work as an all
round half, while Frankenheimer is
strong iu defensive play.
Keunedy is in fine trim and is put
ting up his usual cool and aggressive
game. Ilis punting has improved
wonderfully since last season and will be
a feature of Thursday's game.
