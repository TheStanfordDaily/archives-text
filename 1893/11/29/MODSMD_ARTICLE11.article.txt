In this last edition of the Daily
Palo Alto before the great game, we
would say a few words of warning as well
as encouragement. The big bluft that
Berkeloy has been trying to run during
the last few weeks is probably patent
to everyone now, if it has not been so
from the first. Such a bluff can only
lead one to suppose that the Berkeley
eleveu is a strong one aud that they ex
pect to win the Thauksgiving game
If not so, then Berkeley's tnctics are
very strongly tinged with imbecility.
Now we have a just appreciation ot
the merits of our own eleven aud do
not feel any great anxiety as to the out
come of the great game. Yet we would
insist on one point: our boys must tight
for every inch, for nothing will pro
duce defeat sooner than a false feeling
of strength. Let each man and the
team as a whole do the best work they
are capable of, aud the day is ours.
