In an interview with Heffelfinger uot
long since he made the assertion that
football in the west will never equal the
eastern game. He gave as his reason
that there are not enough preparatory
schools on the coast to give men a suf
ficient primary football education before
they enter college.
If he had been well informed in regard
to our preparatory schools he would
probably not have made this assertion.
There can be no better conditions for
the advancement of football than are
found here. Not only is the rivalry as
strong between the two great univer
sities of the coast as it is between any
eastern universities, but our prepara
toiy schools as well are turning out men
every year who arc fine, enthusiastic
players.
It, has been shown that western col
lege men are, as a rule, heavier than
eastern college men, and as weight is so
essential to the success of a team the
odds in that respect arc in our favor.
The development of the game in the
west since the opening of this Univer
sity has been truly wonderful, and we
believe that with a lew more years' ex
perience, we can boast of a team which
will make things interesting for either
Yale or Harvard elevens. It is to be
hoped that such a contest can be ar
ranged before many years.
