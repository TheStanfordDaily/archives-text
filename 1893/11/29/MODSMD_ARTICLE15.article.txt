# Football and Its Possible Reaction.
## 
### 
Now that the fever of excitement
over the coming game is at its height, a
tonic may be well supplied in the
thought that there is a danger of pos
sible reaction against football.
It is important in a college or uni
versity that as many students as pos
sible be well developed individually.
This individual development is far
more important than the excellence of
teams, or victory in contests. Yale
usually excels in sports carried on in
teams. Harvard on the contrary is
noted for her personal athletes. It is
this team spirit in football which tends
to subordinate the interest of
the individual player iu the
great desire fora victorious team.
Sometimes, too, men take part in the
game because of the glory and honor
connected with it, when their own
safety and health demand that they
should not play. The artificial stim
ulus afforded to players by the applause
of a vast crowd, the admiration of
friends, and the proiuineuce given to a
successful player, often gives them a
false idea as to the use of time and
opportunity for training and exercise.
The history of football this year
shows much uufair playing. Five men
died in America this year fromhurts re
ceived, usually in practice games Such
things as these have caused the ques
tion to be asked, whether football as it
is played does not result in more harm
than good.
Football when properly played by the
members of the team and wholesomely
treated by the student body, is one of
the best moulders of student character.
The game however is in serious danger
from various souices; and the extent of
the danger can be well estimated from
the effects of the coming game. College
football will receive a severe test no
Thursday.
It is of the greatest importance that
every member of our team shall play in
a manner that will be above reproach
and criticism; that aggressively, no
man shall provoke an antagonist un
fairly; that no Stanford player shall be
incited by any provocations whatever to
slugging or similar retaliation of any
sort; that it be demanded of referee and
umpire that they enforce all rules with
great strictness, and in such a manner
as to save the game from disgrace of
any kind.
Betting should be discouraged as an
undesirable accompauiment of college
sport. The future of football in Stan
ford and on the coast depends to some
extent upon the conduct and attitude
of each and every student. Any con
duct during the game or after it which
will reflect discredit upon us should be
studiously avoided by all who have the
reputation of the game and of the Uni
versity at heart.
