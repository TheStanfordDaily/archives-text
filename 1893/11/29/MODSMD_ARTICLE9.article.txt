Tune, "Paddy Duffy's Cart."
I am a Stanford student,
At Stanford I belong,
Anil Stanford's glorious victories
Will ever be my pong.
Our speakers can't be beaten,
Our football team's the best,
Our foxy baseball fellows buried
Berkeley by request.
chorus:
Then here's a yell for Stanford,
For Stanford we will fight.
The Stanford students all are men
Of muscle and of might.
We will keep the cardinal waving
And floating on the breeze,
And let our colors fly above
The Palo Alto trees.
The Berkeley men are boasters,
And make an awful fuss,
But it made them sick, they learned
so quick
There are no flies on us.
A football game's a coming
On next Thanksgiving day,
We'll show them then we still have
men
Who know just how to play.
The ladies love the card'nal;
To its brave defenders true
They smile so sweet, when us they
meet,
And wear our colors, too.
And there's not a girl in 'Frisco,
In Oakland, San Jose,
Whose heart does not beat faster
far,
When Stanford wins the day.
Tune, "We are coming, Father Ahrarn."
We are corning onward, Berkeley,
Our ranks are full and strong ;
Just see our waving cardinal
As we gladly march along ;
We leave our work and lessons
This bright Thanksgiving day,
To honor dear old Stanford,
And see our brave boys play.
CHORUS.
We are coming onward, Berkeley,
Our ranks are full and strong;
Just see our waving cardinal
As we gladly march along!
Many days our boys have labored
'Neath Bliss's watchful eye,
That we might be victorious
And break that hateful tie.
Our battle-cry is "Stanford,"
We're bound to win the game;
Ueffelflnger thinks we're tricky,
But we get there just the same.
Tune, " When Johnny Comeh Marching
Home."
The tin horns tooted a joyful tune —
Hurrah! Hurrah!
At Haight Street Park this after
noon—
Hurrah! Hurrah!
For all the people from round about,
With cardinal ribbon, set up a shout
As we put Berkeley up the spout,
When Kennedy kicked the goal.
