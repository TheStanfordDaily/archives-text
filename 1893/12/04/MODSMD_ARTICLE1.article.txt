# ANOTHER TIE WITH U.C.
## Rain and Mud Prevent Our End Runs and Cause Costly Fumbles. 
### 
Stanford Bucks the Line and the U,C.
Punts. First Half, U. 0. 6; Sec
ond Half, Stanford 6.

If it hadn't been for the mud, they say,
Stanford would have won the day.

One of the greatest, crowds ever as
sembled on a football field in San Fran
cisco was present at llaight Street
grounds Thursday afternoon to witness
what proved to be the hardest fought
contest in the history of western foot
ball. The weather was cold and dis
agreeable. A strong wind blew the
mist in sheets over the Held, rendering
the place anything but pleasant to I he
spectators and players I.ong before noon
the two universities had taken posses
sion of the city, and nothing but college
yells were recognized above the din of
tin horns and the shouts of college stu
dents.
The Stanford delegation took the
Valencia street cars at the railroad sta
tion and beaded by the Stanford Band
went rolling down into the heart of the
city amid tooting of horns and the Stan
ford yell Arriving at the grounds the
Stanford section was quickly occupied,
aua with their banners flying and their
patriotic yells, they made a tine appear
ance. Never was such a welcome
<riveu to a team before as was tended to
Captian Wilson's men when they drove
around the field headed by the Stanford
Band. Many were surprised at the
Band. They had no idea that in music
as well as in athletics Stanford could
interest a critical San Francisco multi
tude. The contest between the Stan
ford Band and the one from Berkeley
was quite amusing and very marked.
The meu lined up as follows:
Stanford. U C.

At 2:15 time was called and the
game was started. Unluckily for Stan
ford the ground was wet and slippery,
.u.d it was manifest that the line
plays would be of the most service.
Berkeley chose the west goal and Stan
ford took the ball, a scudding wind
blowing the drizzling rain directly in
the faces of our team. On the opening
play-the flying wedge-Walton, who had

the ball, made thirty yards. Such ;i
brilliant start gave the Stanford adher
ents a chance to release some of their
pent up enthusiasm. On the next
down Berkeley secured the ball, on at)
offside play. 11. C. gained five yards,
but soon lost the ball and Stanford
made threo futile efforts to advance it
the required distance. U. C. then
punted, and Kennedy returned the
kick. Stauford secured the ball and
Walton was sent round the end for fif
teen yards. U. C. secured the ball on
an off-side play, and Taylor punted the
ball over Kennedy's head; Sherman
secured it. Taylor, Burr, and Ransome
failed to gain the five yards necessary,
and Stanford took the ball. Captain
Benson of the U. C. secured the ball
on a fumble, and by two runs and a
buck by llansome, and a foul tackle by
Captain Wilson, U C. g ined enough
ground to score a touch-down. Rail
some kicked the goal.
Stanford took the ball in the centre
of the field, and Walton gained ten
yards. Kennedy, Walton, and Frank
enheimer took turns with the ball and
brought it dangerously near to the
Berkeley goal, but, when another five
yards would have secured a touch-down
Whitehouse was called off aide, and
Berkeley secured the ball. Taylor
punted to the centre of the field, and
Stanford had to begin her work over
again.
Then there was seen the finest exhi
bition of football during the game.
From the centre of the field Stanford
forced the ball steadily down into U.
C.'s territory. Frankenheiiner did
great work and was given the ball re
peatedly fora plunge through left
tackle. When within ten yards of the
goal line, Berkeley secured the ball—
Taylor trying a kick which was spoiled
by Code. Claude Downing grabbed
the ball and rushed it to the two-yard
line, but the umpire decided that there
had been an offside play on the part of
Berkeley and we were deprived of the
thirteen-yard gain and given five yards.
Time was almost up, aud when the
whistle blew the ball was dangerously
near the U. C.'s goal; score, Berkeley,
6—Stanford 0.
From the brilliant wurk done in the
latter part of the first half, the general
opinion was that Stanford would yet
prove the victor. The cardinal flags
were waving triumphantly when time
was called for the second half.
In the opening play Berkeley gained
nine yards. Stanfor i soon got the ball
on an off-side play, and Walton ad
vanced the ball five yards. Kennedy
punted, and Ransome missed the catch
but fell on the ball. Taylor then
panted, and Kennciy missed, and Burr
fell on the ball. U. C. lost the ball on
downs and Walton was sent through
the line fora good gain. In the scrim
mage Benson and Code were disqual

itied by the umpire fora breach of the
rules. llarrelson filled Code's place
and Wilder, Benson's place.
Stanford started in fora touch-down,
aud after a series of wedges and bucks
ou both sides the ball was gradually
worked down the field into the Berkeley
territory. A touch-down was evidently
close at hand. Finally the ball was
passed over the line by Kennedy. All
depended on the success of the punt
out and kick, but Kennedy did both
successfully.
The ball was brought to the centre
of the field and U. C. made a gain of
ten yards. Frankenheimer caught
Taylor's punt and gained twenty yards.
Kennedy gained five yards through
left tackle, and in a turtle-back gained
five yards. Frankenheimer and Walton
ploughed into the line for short gains.
Berkeley at this juncture secured the
ball on an oft-side play. Wilder fum
bled the pass, and Burnett fell on the
ball.
The hard work began to tell on the
Stanford men and their gains were
small. Sherman's fine work on right
end prevented Stanford from gaining
much ground there, and U. C. secured
the ball on downs. Ransome gained
four yards through Whitehouse, and
Burr, through the same place, five
yards. Smith, Ransome, and Taylor
kept forcing it up the field, and it was
plaiu to all that Stanford would not
secure another touch-down. Stanford
got the ball on a foul acd Kennedy es
sayed a kick, but was partially stopped
by b'mith. Bi r • gained one yard be
tween McMillan and Cochran, and the
ball was given to Stanford on an off
side play. Frankenheimer shot into
the line fora short gain, aud Walton
tacked on a few feet. U. C. then got
the ball on downs, and Taylor kickcd;
Kennedy fell on the ball, and in getting
up Easton deliberately jumped upon
him. Umpire Carter promptly ruled
him out of the game, and Foltz was put
in the centre, Archie Pierce taking
Easton's place at guard.
Walton and Kennedy ran into a stone
wall, but in the next play Walton
gained four yards round the end. Wal
ton added three yards more to this on
the next play. In the wedge which
followed Stanford failed to gain, and
Kennedy was compelled to kick. This
kick was stopped by Smith, but "Fat"
Downing fell on the ball. Walton was
sent round the ( 'end twice, but was
tackled well by Sherman. A criss-cross
from Frankenheimer to Harrelson re
sulted in no gain, and U. C. got the
ball. Burr made three yards and Oscar
Taylor ran round the right end fora
gain of ten yards. Ransome went
through the line for three yards, and
Burr through the tackle for another
short gaii At this point time was
called, with the ball in the centre of
the field.

Score: Stanford 6, U. C. (3. Attend
ance 18,000. Touch-downs: Ransome
1, Kennedy 1. Goals: Taylor 1, Ken
nedy I. Umpire Carter, referee Hurd,
both of Yale.

Three or four good runs were made
round the end by Walton for Stanford,
and Ransome and Taylor for U.C. A
good deal of fumbling was done, but
wlien one takes into account the con
dition of the ball, which was slippery
and soggy, it is a great wonder that
there was not more. The game was
free from any serious injuries Hunt
was compelled to retire on account of his
lame foot, and Sherman, the right guard*
was winded fora short time. These
two men, both U. C.'s, were the only
ones who were at all injured. Not a
Stanford man was hurt. Franken
heimer and Kennedy had their ears
slightly damaged, but that is a trivial
matter in a football game.
Some of the playing was brilliant,
and every man in the Stanford team is
deserving of the greatest praise.
Frankenheimer played the star game of
the day. Harry Walton did nobly and
liis work was fine. Had it been a good
day and the field in good shape, he
would more than once have caused a
panic in the Herkeley ranks. Kennedy
did aswell as could be expeeted under
the circumstances, doing well in every
thing except punting. Under more
favorable conditions ''Fancy" would
have played a star game. "Jeff" Wil
son aud 0. Dowuing were giants on the
ends and brought their men down every
time. McMillan repeatedly gained
ground whenever given the ball and
Cochran, Burnett, 'Fat" Downing, and
Whitehouse did all that could be de
sired. Code played his usual good
game at quarter and was in every play;
in fact, he was in one play which he
could just as well have kept out of.
When he was ruled off, Harrelson took
his place and played well.
For the U. C's., Ransome, Rurr,
Taylor, and the younger Sherman did
the best work. Sherman's tackling was
not far behind Henry's in last year's
game. Taylor's kicking was the best
ever seen on the coast, and it is un
doubtedly due to him that Stanford did
not win the game. Had Stanford
kicked the ball more in the last part of
the second half she would perhaps
have had better success and the game
might have had, for us, a more satis
factory issue.

The third annual football game
between the two great universities of
the Pacific Coast has been played, and
last year's tie is still undecided. Four
teen to ten, ten to ten, and six to six,
are scores which show no very one-sided
contests.
The first year the Stanford team
averaged eleven pounds to the man
