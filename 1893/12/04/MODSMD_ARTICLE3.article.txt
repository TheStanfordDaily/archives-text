The tie remains. We congratulate
our opponents of Thursday upon the
issue of the great fight. To us it is
very unsatisfactory, to them it must be
intensely flattering. To the magnanim
ous victors of previous years it means
little but supplying our antagonists
with hope and energy fora future
struggle. To those who, on the other
hand, fought with the energy of
despair and who successfully struggled
and strained every nerve to hold down
a superior foe, it means that there is
hope yet; it means that it would be
useless to ijive up as a forlorn hope the
great contest for supremacy on the foot
ball field, a thing which they thought
it would be uecesaary to do.
Our opponents have always been fav
orites of fortune. Everything has
usually combined to give them the fin
est chances. We do not mean that the
condition of the field did not handicap
each team to an equal degree, but there
is such a thing as being able to rise to
an occasion and if ever such ability was
wanted it was during the game in the
mist and mire of Thursday. It filled
us with admiration aud enthusiasm to
see the way our men rose to the occas
ion and put up a battle royal in con
ditions and circumstances under which
they had never trained, and to which
they were eutirely unaccustomed.
Football has been raised in the es
timation of everyone by the conduct of
the teams during the wrestle for victory.
Their behavior was equally as excellent
from a spectator's point of view as from
that of an expert. Nothing occurred
to shock the most sensitive in regard to
unmanly, unfair playing, and if this
standard of play continues to be main
tained, the football of the Pacific Coast
will be an example for every team
worthy of the uame to follow.
The firm decisions of the umpire were
admirable; not that they did not seem
severe in some cases, but they were
necessary in order to maintain the
status of the game. Were it possible
to procure at all times su f, ,h impartial
men to watch the contests it would do
much to restore a spirit of athletic
honor sadly lacking in some local teams.
Our confidence in our team, individ
ually and as a whole, is greater than it
has ever been, and we feel proud to

have been represented by those who
showed such admirable grit and deter
mination in maintaining the standing of
the University on the football field.
