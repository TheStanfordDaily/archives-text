It has been a matter of great surprise
and wonder that, a body of students
could get together and in .->ix weeks
produce a band of over forty pieces oi
which any military company might well
be proud. This, however, is only an
other of the many evidences to be found
everywhere of the intense activity that
the student body can show whenever
occasion requires, and of the mass of
ability and latent talent which is to be
found here and only needs occasion to
show itself. The splendid showing the
Band made on its own account, but es
pecially in contrast with our rival's
band, should be a source of satisfaction
to our musicians and a sufficient reward
for their labors.
