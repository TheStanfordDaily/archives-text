The question bothering everyone
just now is whether we should dial
lenge the U. C. to another varsity foot
lull game which shall decide the tie of
Thursday. There seems to be a gen
eral agreement in thinking that the tie
is unsatisfactory to both teams and that
they would prefer to take the necessary
time and put up another game in the
near future. Indeed the desire on the
part of every enthusiast of the game is
to have the superiority of the teams
decided. It would be well if those
having authority to act in tuch a case
as this would take the thing in hand
and decide whether, it is expedient or
not to play the game again and decide
whether we shall retain the champion
ship of the coast.
