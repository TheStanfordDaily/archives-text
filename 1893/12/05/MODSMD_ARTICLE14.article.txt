Now that the Band is in full swing
hud capable of presenting an' interesting
program it stems in place to suggest
that a promenade concert sometime be
fore the Christmas vacation would be
very desirable and would aff ird a pleas
ant evening's entertainment to all.
There have been promenade concerts
before and all have been appreciated,
but they usually occurred at an unfor
tunate time when many students were
unable to attend. We would suggest
thai a uuncutl be bhortiy before
the clostf of the semester. This will
not entail any extra work upon the
members at a time,-when any leisure
Jias to be devoted to preparation lor

final examinations, as they are in as
good form now as can be desired.
We trust that this wish, expressing
as it does the general feeling of the
student body, will meet with the cor
dial approval of every member of the
Hand.
