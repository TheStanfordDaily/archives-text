# The
						U.C.-Stanford Freshman Game.
## 
### 
The U. C. fis working with great,
energy in preparation for an iuter-'97
game next Saturday. Their varsity
manager was on the campus today, and
the telegraph wires were kept buzzing
yesteiday. Heffelfinger is still with
them and is coaching the freshman
team. There has been a misunder
standing in regard to the challenge they
is?»ued our Irishmen. Turner, mana
ger of' 97 here, asserts that no formal
acceptance was made, but a tacit under
standing was had that the freshman
teams should play at the Midwinter
Fair, provided expenses, etc. should be
guaranteed.
The general feeling here is that our
freshmen should play the game not
withstanding the Berkeley's evident,
thorough preparation for it and our
freshman team's lack of condition and
practice for the event; but on this con
dition—that, the U. C. varsity play our
Varsity on the following Saturday.
