# Counting Value of University Work.

### 
('n effect in all departments, Jan. 1, 1804 )
Every hour for which credit is given
1 * understood to represent approximately
fir the average student three hours of
actual work per week througout the
M'niester. Thus, in lecture or recita
tion work one hour is allotted to the
lecture or recitation and two hours for

preparation or subsequent reading and
study ou the part of' the student.. Where
the time is wholly occupied with draw
ing, field, or laboratory work, three full
hours per week through one semester
arc to be expected of the student for
each hour that counts towards gradua
tion. Where the drawing, field, or
laboratory work is supplemented by
systematic outside reading or experi
ment, under the direction of the instruc
tor, such a reduction may be made in
actual drawing, field, or laboratory
time, as seems just to the department
concerned.
