# President Jordan on Intercollegiate Football.
## 
### 
(Telegram to the Examiner.)
I believe ig intercollegiate football.
The training and the effort put forth by
the men in the great games will help
them in all their future endeavors. It
makes up for interruption in their college
work many times over, if it does not
turn their heads away from it, and
usually it does not. The reflex effect
on the body of students is good.
Football is action. It is genuine. It
makes for decision of char
acter. It is an antidote to the
mal uiies of dilettantism and pessimism
which are said to afflict the eud of a
century. Football is not a ' ladylike"
game. It is not a pastime for afternoon
teas. It is a manly game, and so long
as it is manly it is the best antidote to
its own evils.
There are evils actual and possible
connected with football. 1 do not favor
games between college teams and out
side athletic clubs. They work at
cross purposes. Intercollegiate games
should be on college grounds. Men
who enter college for football only are
a source of demoralization. Their pres
ence may change the game from a
contest of men to a struggle of beasts.
Games have been played on the level of
the sandbag. If this is tolerated col
lege football is doomed A manly game
demands the essence of courtesy, even
if the forms cannot be observed.
Gambling and drunkenness have fol
lowed football: they are not caused by
ii:. The university is no place fora
man who is not a gentleman. College
public opinion should give no toleration
to college "muckers," gamblers, and
blackguards. When these "paint the
town red" after a great game it is no
fault of the game. lilauie rather the
leniency of the police.
There is more to be said in criticism.
Hut say it all, and still, had I not been
lorn some twenty years too soon, I
would make it my ambition to be a
Stanford centre rush. When the game
is over there is time for other ambitions
