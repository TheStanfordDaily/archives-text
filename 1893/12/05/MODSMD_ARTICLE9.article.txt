# Shall the Thanksgiving Game Be Abolished?
## 
### 
In an editorial in the Lit.for last
April the first note of warning was
given the student body of the remark
able and astounding intention oil the
part of some of the trustees to abolish
the Thauksgiving game with Yale. The
editorial caused considerable lifting of
the eyebrows, but as other things tilled
the vanishing days of spring the matter
was forgotten. Few of the students
realized at commencement time the
serious condition of affairs, and few of
them realize it now.
As was announced last year, the
trustees are led to this course of action
because of the disgraceful scenes in
New York on the evening of each
Thanksgiving day, the evil having, as
the trustees believe, increased year by
year, and being chiefly attributed by
them to the students. Let us look at
the situation fairly and squarely.
On the evening of Thanksgiving
day Now York boeomos the srone of
much boisterous and noisy revelry. A
great deal of drinking goes on, and at
many of the theatres there is so much
noise and shouting in the audience that
the players cannot be heard. The con
cert halls witness the same thing on a
larger scale. There is a vast amount

of drinking in public places, and much
noise and shouting on the public streets;
there is a great deal that is worse than
this but it is happenings of this sort that
to the New Yorkers are distinguishing
marks of Thanksgiving night. The
next morning the papers are filled with
glaring and lurid accounts of the "car
nival'' of the night before, in which
accounts a modicum of truth in mingled
with a vast amouut of padding, the
work of clever space reporters, and
which, if any one will take the trouble
to compare tliem with each other, will
be seen in most matters of detail to
differ hopelessly among themselves.
Much of tlie disturbance of the night
is, as every student knows, the work of
outsiders, or in college parlance "muck
ers," masquerading under college colors.
We have tried to give a fair state
ment of the facts, and while they are
not so bad as they are often believed to
be, we confess they are bad enough.
While there may be nothing so very
harmful in a dozen foolish students
parading Broadway, yet if thqy are
likely to attract fifty or more reckless
townsmen and cause a statement to be
published abroad the next day that an
immense throng of students, mostly
under the influence of liquor, blocked
Broadway and held pandemonium all
night—if such results, we say, are
likely to follow, why then it is much
better for the dozen students to look at
the matter philosophically, and if they
have to work oft' their youthful spirit,
to do it somewhere else. While they
may, with perfect impunity, eat meat
ottered to idols, yet if they thereby
cause their brother, the young school
boy, or the space reporter, to offend,
they had best eat no meat, while the
world standeth. We do not think that
the case is as bad as the trustees
believe, but is it not true that such a
celebration as has been customary, is to
say the least, a very childish exhibition,
and one which is apt to do the college
infinite harm?— Nassau Literary Mag

[The above article was intended for
the football issue, but owing to lack of
space it was crowded out. It gives us
great pleasure to note that while the
course of action in New York may have
been disgraceful on the evening of the
great game, that of our boys in general
deserves the greatest commendation. —
