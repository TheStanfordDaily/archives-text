# PROFESSOR ANDERSON'S LECTURE.
## Poetry and Modern Thought. 
### 
That hard-headed thinker Dr. John
son, assigned as the proper object for
free and disinterested thought, the
"past, the distant, and the future;" and
it would be very difficult to persuade
literary and historical students that the
London of today is more interesting
than the London of Queen Elizabeth
or Queen Anne. With respect to pop
ulation and material productions "the
spacious tiuiea of great Elizabeth"
shrink, when compared with the present,
to the dimensions of Boston Common
set over against the prairies of Illinois.
What makes the times of great Eliza
beth seem spacious is the (act that they
were large enough to contain and nour
ish Shakspere and Ben Johnson,
Bacon and Coke, Walter llaleigh and
IMiillip Sidney, Hooker and Donne,
Gilbert and Harvey, George Chapman
and Edmund Spenser, and a dozen other
wits, the least of whom was the intel
lectual peer of the foremost Englishman
of today.
Obviously, however, not every age
can be the worst, or even worse than
the ages before and after. But if this
pathetic mixture of pessimism touching
the present with optimism touching the
past and the future be a poetic illusion,
it is at all events no ignoble one. If
today be better than yesterday, it is, as
.Matthew Arnold reminds us, not be
cause of the Atlantic cable and of civil
liberty, but rather because of the use
we make of these good things. How
ever true the Emersonian doctrine of
the superiority of today over yesterday
and tomorrow may be in the sphere of
ethics and religion, there are, I venture
to think, some respects wherein today
will turn out to have been inferior to
yesterday.
At a time of so much interest in es
says and lectures about literature, the
e<«itention that poetry is just now on
the decline may seem a paradox. The
step from literary study and criticism
to creative production is no easy one,
and it may be profitable to remind our
selves that Italy was never so barren of
genuine fruits of the higher under
standing as at the time of Milton's visit,
when every Italian city had its learned
societies or academies for the advance
ment of letters by Battery of the let
tered.
In the first place, the present is un
doubtedly, if not the busiest, at least
the most hurried of all ages. Outside
of Browning clubs the men who do the
work of the world arc too busy to read
poetry. Poetry, like her heavenly
cousin, Piety, is a jealous goddess; she
will not accept the worship of the di
vided and distracted mind. There is
no more shallow and vulgar error than
to assume that, the reading of the best

poetry is fit] employment for hours of
indolence and ease It is precisely for
busy people that poetry is tonic.
What we call the enterprise of the age
has abolished leisure. The still, small
voice is drowned by the din of the
stock exchange. The poetry of travel
departed with the stage-coach.
What busy man of the present could
afford, like Cliaucer, to spend a whole
day in rapt contemplation of a daisy?
Old Dan Chaucer was a busy man for
those days; he was soldier, courtie r ,
diplomatist, scholar, poet, and withal a
lover of good company and good cheer.
As a collector of the port of London he
was obliged to keep his books with his
own hand, yet when he had a holiday
lie was capable of spending it in gazing
at a daisy. We have had one such
man in America, and no one has done
our country more honor: for Nathaniel
Hawthorne, like GeofFery Chaucer, was
once a customs house officer. Hat now
adays such men (if such there be) are
seldom appointed to office. What ed
itor of a great modern newspaper could,
like lien Johnsou, fix his eye upon his
great toe and see Saracens and giants
lighting round it? The blanket sheet
newspaper is the crowning glory of our
prodigious century.
The agnosticism, pessimism, positiv
ism of our time —isms which foster
what Sainte-Beuve calls "the spirit and 1
the touch of hardness" in the temper of
the age —are well-nigh fatal to poetry. I
In our own generation, the genera
tion of men who are now approaching
middle life, not a single poet has ap
peared— not one. We have clever
versifiers galore, but not a man of them i
has a message to his time. No one to
day finds enlargement of soul as he
broods over Milton, or glows with gen
erous emotion over the page of Shelley.
The present is the golden age of crit
icism, and it is the poet critics who
have made it so. Goethe, Lessing,
Schiller, and Coleridge were all great,
both as poets and as critics. Matthew
Arnold has had hundreds of readers of
his critical prose to oae reader of his
poetry.
There has resulted a great enhance
incut of the dignity of a life of letters,
and a wholesome change in the tone
and temper of modern criticism. In
brief, poets are uow tried by a jury of
their peers, and are no longer put to
the torture before conviction, as by the
slovenly butchers ol (he old time quar
terly reviews.
The ereat've imagination is
in fact, not upon poetry but upon the
novel; and here indeed we find the
"criticism of life" which we miss in
contemporary poetry, flow many good
lessons and admonitions is the worid
accepting from popular novelists, and
how many more is it likely to stomach
without appreciably mending its ways!
The novel turns out to be the best of

all pulpits, and if the poet-novelist con
vert no sinner he has the double pleas
ure of speaking his mind and of putting
money in his purse.
In the varied orchestral movement of
the thought-life of our age, poetry is
the missing chord.
The "general reader" is none other
than the coming man. What will the
coming man read? It seems to me. that
a general solution of this question calls
for no prophetic spirit: such a solution
is to be sought in the conditions and
tendencies of the present. There is
always a limit to what a man can read.
Scientific studies are the absorbing in
tellectual interest of the present time.
Literature proper seems to be losing
ground. Mr. Howells expressed the
opinion that the writing of poetry is a
childish business unbecoming to grown
men.
In my opinion literature will be
greatly benefitted by the scientific im
pulse and will go on to new and higher
achievements We could as well afford
to skip Bacon as to skip Darwin.
The American of today devours his
story, like his pie, hot from the oven
A new-born story is read by thousands
while the author's brain is still palpi
tating with its birth-throes.
Rightly considered, however, it be
comes evident that we do derive from
poetry knowledge as well as the
more precious boons of solace, sym
pathy, and stimulus. Shakspere's
plays arc the very essence and marrow
of the history of his century. No one
could read Dante and Chaucer atten
tively without knowing the Middle
Ages more intimately than lie could
learn them from all the histories in the
world. So long as men are interested
in what the race has thought and suf
fered and achieved, so loug will poetry
remain one of the primary sources of
historical knowledge.
Matthew Arnold defines poetry as
being "nothing less than the most per
fect speech of man, that in which he
comes nearest to being able to utter the
truth " Of true poetry there can never
be too much. There will always be
more varieties of mood, personality
than kinds of poetry to satisfy them.
Next to the peace passing under
standing that the world cannot give nor
take away—nay, I believe akin to it—
is the peace that comes to the weary
teacher of men, when biifHed, disheart
ened, in doubt perhaps, he suddenly
finds himself lifted from these quick
sands and buoyed up by the compulsive
j vurrent of some noble poem.
