It is safe to say that the interest in
the final football struggle on Thanks
giving Day has never in the history of
Princeton been greater than this year
As the eventful day draws near the
tremendous importance of the struggle
is more indelibly impressed on the feel
ings of every one, whether football en
thusiast or not. The spirit of unity on j
the part of the college at large, which
has been so noticeable during the whole
season, manifesting itself in a lack ot
fault-finding and criticism of the team, |
in the confidence in the coachers and
management, and in the content with
which vague reports of secret practice
have been received, is the spirit which
we believe is a great factor in winning |
the game. When each man in college i
withdraws individual opinion and conjec
ture and instead ot a hesitating,doubtful
attitude shows a quiet determination to
win, the team cannot fail to feel the
tremendous moral inspiration such a
support gives. ].et the remaining
hours be filled with eager expectancy
Let every man go to New York calm,
cheerful, determined. While enthusi
astic let him remember that on the con
duct ot the students this year hangs
the future of the Thanksgiving game.
