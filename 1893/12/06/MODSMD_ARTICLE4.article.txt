### 
The time is near at hand wlien next
year's football captain will be elected.

in a scheduled Varsity game have a vote
for captain. There are but fifteen such
men in the University. They arc the
Varsity eleven — Kennedy, Walton,
Frankenheimer, Code, P. Downing,
Burnett, McMillan, Whitehouse, Coch
ran, Wilson, and C. Downing—and
those subs, who played in one or both
of the Olympic games—Lewis, McKay,
Spalding, aud Harrelson—who also
pluyed during the secoud half of the
recent game.
Those spoken of as candidates are
Kennedy, full-back on the team for two
successive years, half-back foi the Uni
versity of Colorado for one year; Code,
quarter-back on the Varsity for three
successive years, and quarter-back for
San Francisco Boys High School for
one year; P. Downing, on the team for
three successive years, first as half-back,
then as guard, and last as centre; C.
Downing, tackle the first year, sub. the
second year, and this year end; and
Cochran, for the last two years Varsity
tackle, and for one year previous tackle
for Lawrenceville.
They are all experienced players.
