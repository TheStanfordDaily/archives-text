# "The Stanford Quad" Will Be the Name of Our Annual.
## 
### 
At a regular meeting of the Board of
Editors of the '95 Annual this after
noon the name "The Stanford Quad"
was chosen as the most characteristic
and, at the same time, the mo-t sub
stantial and suggestive of the fifteen
names considered. The editor-in-chief
has given notice that all literary work
must be submitted by the second Wed
nesday of the second semester.
W. E. Stuart has been appointed an
assistant business manager. One or two
other assistants will soon be appointed
for the business department of the An
nual. A competitive prize of five dol
lars will be offered for the best design
for the cover of The Stanford Quad,
both as to color and artistic effect.
