The football season is over and the
nerves of the students are slowiy assum
injj their normal tension. Everyone is
hastening to make up back work, and
studies in geueral seem to be receiving
more than ordinary attention. This is
true not only of the footballists, but of
all students in the University. This
state of things is no doubt somewhat in
the nature of a reaction, and if disbe
lievers in college athletics could see the
renewed zest with which studies are
once more taken up after a period of
athletic interruption, we think that
they might, perhaps, be converted. No
doubt athletic events have a tendency
to disturb serious study, but it) the end,
the university work is pursued with in
creased vigor.
