It is strange how small an occurrence
will turn a body of students—supposed
young gentlemen —into a set of freed
lunatics. It would not ordinarily be
supposed that a sane person, and a stu
dent at that, would have his head
turned by so small a thing as the going
out of the lights in a boarding hall, but
such is frequently the case. No sooner
do tlie lights disappear in Kncina at
any unusual time, than certain of the
inmates are at once transformed into
howling fiends who demonstate their
unfitness to inhabit this earth in every
conceivable way. There is a proper re
gion, we are told, for the entertainment
of fiends of every variety; and if these
particular students would seek their true
abode sooner instead of later, it would
afford great relief to all.
