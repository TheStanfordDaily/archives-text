# WORTHY IS THE MAN.
## The 						Indiana Papers Have Recently Said This of Professor Swain. 
### 
When Dr. Coulter resigned there was j
some speculation as to what man would
be considered worthy to fill his position.
Professor Svvain of Leland Stanford Jr.
University was finally persuaded to ac
cept the position he now occupies, j
The selection of Prof. Swain was l>y uo
means a surprise to the older students
who had known him while here, lie
was closely connected wth Dr. Jordan
in all his reform movements, and was |
one of the first chosen to go to Cali
fornia.
The new administsation is a couth:-1
uat.ion of the two previous ones, as!
Prof. Swain's ideas are in harmony !
with those of his two predecessors. 11 is
offioiency, adaptability, liberal ideas,!
broad sympathy, and general knowledge ,
are well known.— Bloomington World.
The members of the 15 iard of Trus
tees as a body, and also individually, j
express themselves as highly gratified i
with the work and business administra
tion of President Swain. The new pros- j
ideuthas already secured the hearty co
operation and good will of all those I
about him, which is a necessity in order
to secure the best work. The Hoard
could not have hoped fora better con
dition of afitirs, which means that the:

in a late issue, an address by President
Swain entitled I, A Plea for Higher
Education " The following paragraphs
are taken from this address:
"When you have resolved to make
the most of'your opportunities, to live
the best life it is possible for you to
live, you will find no more congenial
atmosphere, no better opportunity, no
higher incentive to properly eipiip your
selves (or your life's work, than you
will find in the free air of one of our
progressive nioiern universities. You
should go to that institution, in what
ever land or under whatever name, that
will trive you the broadest views of life,
the highest ambition, the most exact in
formation concerning }our own place in
the world, and will endow you with the
greatest power and inspiration to snc
cesstully till it.
When a young person becomes inter
ested in any particular line and knows
exactly what he wants to study he
should go to that institution which un
der all circumstances wo'ild give the
best remits in the line of his choice for
the money and time expended. I would
not advise any student who has definite
ideas of just the subjects be wishes to
study to go to any institution without
first kn iwing something of the men in
whose department, he wishes to stu-iy
There is a conservatism about our older
and long-established institutions wni.h
permitted men who were inferior or
past their period of greatest usefulness
to be retained in the university faeult\;
so the fame of any particular institution
of higher learning does not always indi
cate ihe usefulness or efficiency of the
department in which you have chosen
your line of work
"Furthermore, the friends you make
in college will be yours for life and, too,
you will find a friend in any college
man. Something of ihe feeling of lei
lowship exists between all college men
like that which exists between mem

bers of the same church or secret order,
bur there is an enthusiasm of youth
about college associations and friend
ship which elings throughout life. In
the German universities '-the fellow
feeling among free spirits" is held to
be one of the most important elements
in their grand system of higher educa
tion.
"A student of average ability with
diligence and high purposes runs no
risk whatever in being stranded with
nothing to do wlieu he gets through
college. When you arc ready for work
the world will need your services and
you have no right to offer your services
until you are thoroughly equipped."
