Possibly from lack of knowledge of
the rules governing the sport, "liare
and hounds" has never had a noticeable
place in our recreatious, despite the
fact that, the country about us is ad

generally used in governing hare and
hound chases:
1. The chase will be within a radius
of five miles of the start, and the total
distance to be covered shall not be over
ten miles.
2. Two bares, one master of the
pack, and two whips shall be chosen
from the field of eutries.

bags containing scraps of paper which
they shall scatter as they run, for "scent".

utes start of the hounds. They must
keep within hailing distance of each
other and lav « fair continuous trail.

and must surmount all obstacles over
which they laytrail. In all cases where
the hare's paper gives out, the break
for home must be indicated by scatter
ing colored paper.
5. The mast< r will act as pacemaker
and have entire charge of the hounds
until a break is ordered He nny ap
point temporary pacemakers at any
period of the chase.
