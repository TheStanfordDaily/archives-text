# The 						Stanford Museum.
## 
### 
No university in this country can
boast of so magnificent a museum as
the Leland Stanford Junior University.
The stately building with its massive
stone pillars and the beautiful marble
vestibule are too well known to need
any description here, but a sketch of
what may be seen there will be of in
terest.
The three rooms at, the right of the
entrance are devoted to oriental collec
tions. In the first has been placed the
Cesiiola collection of Greek and Roman
pottery, which comprises over 5,000
pieces, and i-< one of the best collections
of its kind i,. the world. In an adjoin
ing room has 1 ceo placed the Egyptian
collection, the chief part of which is
the three mummies which occupy glass
cases in the centre of the room An
other interesting part of this collection
is the group of plaster casts of the lin
irigs of ancient tombs.
< )ne of the most interesting parts of
the museum is the Leland Stanford Jr.
room in which have been placed all
the toys and curiosities which Leland
co'lected in his travels abroad. From
this collection it would seem that he
must have taken a great interest in
those tilings which savored of war and
military, for armor, swords, shields, pis
tols, guns, and other instruments of war
fare predominate. In the centre of the
room is a I nge case of smaller curiosi
ties which were catalogued by him
when thirteen years old. A fine case of
birds and a large collection of Indian
mortars and pestles are among the most
notice, hie things in the room.
Lack of sp:ice prevents a more min
ute description of the various things of
interest. The sec >nd floor will be de
voted to | .intings and works of art.
['here are already two ear I tads of pic
tun.- hen which will soon be placed on
the walls. Usd's other statuary
which will he placed in the museum, a
family gr upc will occupy the centre
of the vi stibu'.c.
As soon as the I'niversity closes in
the spring the interior of the building
will be fre-'")ed by Tiffany,of New York.
The work of arranging the collections
i< under the supervision of J. K.
Wight, '!)>>, and h being pushed forward
1 as rapidly as possible.
