# Physical Training.

### 
There are many wlio still >ee with
apprehension the proportions which
physical training has assumed in our
higher institutions ol' learning, and
doubt the utility ol' the great attention
paid to athletics, especially ;n the inter
collegiate panics. There are those still
liviug who remember when students
passed their courses of study and c:inie
forth well equipped for the strui.ule of
life without their artificial aids, at least

without any scientific training in the
sports of youth. If the hard student
broke down occasionally after he got
his honors, there was no suspicion that
invalidism was net providential. In
fact, a generation or so ago most, boys
were brought up to take some share iu
the industries of their parents, even
when preparing for college.
It is not so very long ago that work
fur well-to-do boys went out of fashion.
The not distant predecessors of the
students who now occupy luxurious
steam-heated suites of rooms used to
saw their own wood and pack it up
stairs, and the labors of the Greek
heroes about whom they read, they
could fully appreciate. Indeed, in days
still remembered, college presidents
made daily, sturdy if unheryio attacks
on their own woodpiles. To work with
the hands was once not beneath the
d'guity of the scholar. A good propor
tion of the giants of those days who
became famous in the law, in*the pulpit,
and io the senate-house, were stalwart
men whose boyhood had been hardened
and invigorated, and those who look
baek to those days with regret., and
query whether modern athletics will
produce a race of men like the old civic
heroes.
The hero of the college is the stu
dent who wins trophies for his alma
mot< r by the oar or on the green field.
It is he who sets the fashion and gives
the tone to college life, and it is a vig
orous tone and a manly fashion. To
this standard every man in college is
more or less desirous of attaining, even
though he does not expect to become a
great athlete or a public competitor in
the games. With this manliness goes
a sense of honor that makes the college
games real trials of skill and endurance,
and sets a standard lor the country of
fairness and honorable competition far
removed frotu many pub'ic games and
races that have not even the merit of be
ing games of chance. â€”Charles Dudley
Warner in Harper's Magazine for Nov
ember. (Condensed.)
But the question is not a practical
one. Manners have changed, the whole
social order has changed, and the mod
ern scheme of education has to adopt
itself to the new conditions. That ath
letics is a necessary part of the scheme
of education can no longer be doubted,
for it remains true as it was before the
change that somehow a sound vigorous
body is essential to the best mental
training and achievement. Those who
are foremost in athletics are foremost iu
the college in all that prophecies sue'
cess in life, and they are generally not
laggards in the class room. Those who
: devote themselves to athletics with an
almost professional zeal must be Spar
tans in their habits. Not only is every
sort of dissipation forbidden them, but
they must live lives of absolute abstem
iousness and temperance, of rigid self
denial, of regularity, of discipline.
I This habit of self-control, this subor
i dination of all indulgence, is of the
: highest educational value to them.
I Hut not to them alone. They set the
i standard of conduct in college. And
the standard is that of health, of man-
I liness, of self-control.
