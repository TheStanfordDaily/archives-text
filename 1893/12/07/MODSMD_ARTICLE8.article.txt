The lively iuterest taken in baseball
this year augurs an earl)' ami successful
season tor the coming year. About
thirty oanoidates appear on the new
diamond east of Encina Hall every
evening ro engage in light practice, ami
judging from the form shown by the
uew men who will be candidates for the
Varsity next spring, Stanford will be
represented by a team superior even to
that put in the field lust year.
With football out of the way, class
teams should be organized immediately*
so that an inter-class series of games
ejuld be played immediately after the
coming vacation. The management
will probably secure a game on the
home grounds early in the spring
against the champion Bostons, and t<Â»
make a creditable showing the team
should be organized as soon as possible.
