Judging from the financial state of
affairs, it would seem that the athletic
association will not have funds enough
left over, after all the bills are paid, to
send the football team on its proposed
northern trip during the Christinas va
cation. At any rate the lack of cash
will undoubtedly keep the Mandolin
and Glee Clubs from going on the same
trip. At it-Â« meeting last evening the
Hoard of Directors laid the Mandolin
Club's proposition on the table. No
one willj question the w : sdoni of this
action. It would be foolish indeed, to
think of incurring an advance expense
of something like $1 300 when the
probable gain under favorable circum
stauccs would be only $300, taking the
manager's figures as presented last even
ing. The benefit to be derived comes
far from justifiing so great a risk, when
there is such urgent need of all such
funds in order to put in useful condit
ion our embryo track and half-com
pleted baseball grounds.
