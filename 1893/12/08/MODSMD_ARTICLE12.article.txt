With today's issue the publication of
the Daily Palo Alto for this semester
ceases. The paper was started this
year one week before the University
opened, with a view of suspending pub
lication long enough before the end of
the semester to enable the staff to meet
the pressure of the additional work
usual at the close of every term.
Much time and laboi has been demanded
from all who have assisted in the edit
ing of the paper. It may seem a
small matter to the casual reader to
have a sufficient amount of copy ready
each day, and especially such as is desir
able. To the newspaper man, and es
pecially the amateur journalist, the task
is by no means a trival one. Those
who are faithful and conscientious in
the discharge of their duties to the
piper must necessarily have less time to
devote to their studies; besides, time is
further encroached upon by the fre
quent interruption that inevitably
comes to the enterprising reporter.
Whether we have succeeded in main
taining the reputation of the paper, and
in making it equal or superior to many
other college dailies,- wo leave to the de
cision of our readers.
That we have given the paper our
best efforts we feel no hesitancy in say
ing. Instead of making many bold
ventures that might possibly shed lus
tre and seem like a brilliant st r oke of
enterprise, we have adopted a more
conservative policy and kept close to
beaten paths We have endeavored to
express our judgment impartially re
garding University matters. Besides
the publishing of news, which perhaps
is the principal feature of the paper, we
have tried to advance the interests of
all the student enterprises by words of
encouragement. As to some few mat
ters that needed criticism, we have ap
plied the corrective as best we knew —
perhaps in some cases too severely, but
yet, on the whole, we think, generously.
Harmony and a spirit of co-operation
have prevailed in all the work of the
staff. To no one can be ascribed the
success of the semester's work. Each
has contributed something,—some more,
others less. Acknowledgment is dun
every student and professor who has
given us assistance, even though it may
have been no more than a quad or the

cue to an editorial. To those who have 1
given us the most valuable service we |
owe a debt of gratitude. That the
Daily Palo Alto will in the future
hold the place in the hearts of the stu
dents that it docs today, is our earnest
desire. That it will be under able man
agement for the ensuing semester is
recognized by all who are familiar with
the work that has already been done by
the present business manager and editor
in-chief clect.
