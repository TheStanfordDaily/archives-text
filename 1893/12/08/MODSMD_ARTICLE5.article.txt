# Review of Current Events.

Every student should manifest suffic
ient interest in the topics of the day to
enable him to understand and discuss
intelligently the principal issues that
are engrossing the attention of the
people. For this purpose the reading
tables in Encina have been supplied
with the leading dailies and best peri
odicals. The enterprise is proving a
thorough success.
The past four months, which consti
tute the first semester of the college
year, have marked a period of unusual
activity and interest in almost every
department of public life; the daily re
cord of events has been as fascinating
as a novel.
The close of the World's Fair, which
seemed to be a great, living personality
with which the nation was loath to
part, has been the subject of some of
the finest, descriptive and speculative
literature of the year. The tragic
death of Mayor Harrison further riveted
the eyes of the people upon Chicago,
and also had the peculiar effect of
inaugurating a series of similar atro
cious attempts upon the lives of promi
nent men in various parts of the
country Legislation added its quota
of national interest, the silver debate in
Congress being one of the stubbornest
contests of recent years. Washing
ton's supply of sensations was not yet
exhausted, for the surprise of the year
came soon afterwards in the announce
ment by the administration of its in
tention to restore the monarchical form
of government in Hawaii.
War has been distracting the sister
republic of Brazil, and the harbor of
New York has witnessed the equipment
of an American fleet which sailed in
November to oppose the rebellious
Brazilian navy and its leader, Admiral
Mello. The Republican landslide of
Nov 7 was an almost unpreceded oc
curence, and has changed the aspect of
prospective politics. Amidst it all, the
financial and industrial balance has
been disastrously out of plumb, and
only recently has manifested an inclina
tion to swing back to its proper place.
The present month opens with the
mind of the nation pondering over the
new Free Trade bill, and speculating
upon the prospective legislation of the
present session of Congress The Paci
fic Coast likewise claims its share of at
tention since the Midwinter Fair has
become the subject of national and in
ternational comment.
Across the Atlantic 300,000 English
miners have been contending for home,
for sustenance, and a living wage for
labor. The Home Rule bill has passed
through a gigantic struggle.* Russia
and France have been embracing each
other in ecstatic transports of inter
national fraternity, In distant Africa
the English have been waging bitter
warfare against the native Mntabele
under the leadership of their king, the
irafty Sohengula.
The death list of the season has also
been notable, including the names of
Marshal McMahon of Fiance; ex-Sccrc
tary Jeremiah Rusk; Francis Parkman,
the historian; Gounod, the composer;
Prof. Jowett of Oxford; J. J. C. Ab
bott, ex premier of Canada; Miss Lucy
Stone, the reformer; Dr. Chas. F.
Deems, the New York divine; and
Prof. Tyndall, the scientist.
