# OUR VICTORIOUS TEAM.
## The 						Football Eleven Sweeps All Before Them in the Northwest and Are Now the Undisputed Champions of the Pacific Coast. Score 154 Points to Opponents' 0. 
### 
The result of the longest football trip
ever taken by any eleven in this coun
try has been to establish the supremacy
»if Stanford athletics on this coast, and
t.» replete the athletic treasury suffi
ciently to pay oft' most of its cumber
some debts. The boys were received
in the young cities of the northwest
with unbounded enthusiasm, and re
ceptions and banquets awaited them at
every place. The most extensive prep
arations to receive them had been made
at Portland, where they were the guests
of the Multnomah Athletic Club and
the Associated ex-Calil'ornians of that
city. Seattle, Tacoma, and Port Town
send were turned over to them, and
everything possible was done to make
the tour an enjoyable one.
The first »ame was played at Tacoma
on Christmas day before 3,500 people,
S an ford winning by -48 to 0. Flacker,
Tiicoma's full-back, made a wonderful
kick, which, with his clever all-round
playing, woo him the honors for his
team. The ball had been passed to
him fora punt. The formidable Stan
ford rush line was soon too close upon
him to kick, so he diliberately faced his
own goal and kicked the ball over his
head, far down into Stanford territory.
Two other Tacoma men, Munday and
IWcLane, also deserve special mention.
Walton, llarrelson, and Whitehouse
made many long runs, and were praised
highly by the Taeotnu papers for their
work
On the 27th the team played at Port
Townsend, but did not do much owing
to their listless work. The Port Town
send team deserve great credit for
keeping the secre down to 5u to 0 in
Stanford's favor.
The hardest game played on the trip
was at Seattle, the latter team getting
at one time within fifteen yards of the
Stanford line. No other teams got to
within forty yards of our line. The
Seattle team cannot be too highly
praised for the manner in which they
bucked our line at every quarter for
liood gains, which made i: highly pro
bible at one stage of the game that
they would have the glory of scoring
on us. Russell, Seattle's lull-back, did
phenomenal work in tackling the Stan
ford runners after they had circled the
ends Their three centre men did
great work and repeatedly repulsed
bucks in that quitter. Nichols, left
guard, and Ilarrais, centre, deserve

special credit. Their half-backs —
Frazier iu particular—did good work,
also. Hall, Stanford's left tackle, made
the longest run of the season from his
position. Lewis, Code, llarrelson , and
W'altoj did brilliant work. Score, Stan
ford 40, Seattle 0.
The great feature of the Portland
game on New Year's day was the vim
and dash which every Stanford man
put into his play. The slow work of
the previous games was not repeated,
and the Multnouiahs were completely at
themercy of our team. Joe Smith,
the Portland Jul 1-back, was expected to
win the game on his kicks, but the
Stanford rush line came down on him
at every attempt, at such tactics, and he
was helpless. C. Downing tackled hiui
back of the line in the second half,
thus scoring two points for Stanford,
Kennedy, who played poorly in all the
games on the Sound, did much better in
the Portland game, but his kicking was
decidedly second class. Every man put,
up the best football in him, Harrelsom
Walton, Whitehouse, and P. Downing
receiving special notice in the Port
land papers. Pomeroy played a hue
end and put up the best game for his
team. McDonald at quarter, Laswell,
half-back, and Page^celitre, put up a
strong game, also.
The trip was successful from a finan
cial as well as football point of view,
and Manager Maynard has been able to
pay nearly all the debts outstanding
against the Athletic Association. A
beautiful banner and a gold and silver
puuch howl were presented to the team
at Portland.
