The prospects are that both Encina
and Roble will be more fully occupied
than they were last semester.
A new chef has been secured for
Encina
Instead of buying a half beef at a
time as before the steward will buy
only loins and ribs trimmed. Such an
arrangemeut will secure the best pos
sible cuts for which fully sixty percent,
more will have to be paid. Poultry
and gmie will be served at least once a
week. In a few weeks if eggs continue
to become cheaper they will be served
for breakfast regularly.
The price of board will continue to
be twenty dollars a month.
