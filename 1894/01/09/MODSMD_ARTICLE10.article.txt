# Editor of the "Sequoia."
## 
### 
The resignation of W. L. Charaber
lin, '95, as editor-in-chief of the Se
quoia was publicly announced today.
The reason for the action which Mr.
Chamberlin has taken is given as the
too pressing demands of his University
work. Until his resignation has been
accepted by the Board, which meets
Thursday, and his successor has been
elected, he will continue in charge of
the paper.
The resignation, occurring so unex
pectedly, has found the field of would
be Sequoia editors unoccupied. The
associates on the present staff, it seems,
are no better qualified for the chief
position, so far as experience goes, than
those who have not served in that
capacity.
Probable candidates, as mentioned on
the quad, today, are Hughes, Rose,
and Donald, '95, and Guth, '96, though
they may have no aspirations for the
position.
