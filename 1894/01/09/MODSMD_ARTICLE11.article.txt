# Cliques in Student Elections.
## 
### 
The control of elections for various
official positions in the student body by
cliques of one kind and another should
receive some attention here. The
Brunonicin of Brown University has an
editorial on the subject, an extract
from it being given below:
Recent events have clearly shown
that the disposition to form "combines"
which has existed for the last two years
has been lying dormant, and merely
needed the proper circumstances to
arouse it into activity.
Theie is no real advantage whatsover
to be gained from the exercise of this
practice. No combination has ever yet
been needed to put in office the man
best fitted for the position. The very
fact of the existence and need of a
combination to put a certain person in
a certain office is sufficient to prove that
his merits and fitness for that place are
not able to stand alone.
