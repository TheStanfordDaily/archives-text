# La
						Crosse at Berkeley.
## 
### 
The coming term at the U. 0. will
witness the introduction of a new col
lege gauie on this coast. A few stu
deuts during vacation have been prac
ticing the great Indian and Canadian
game of la crosse, and will organize
teams at once. Twelve men make up
a team. The formation of several teams
will give activity to a larger number ol
men than does football, besides furnish
ing a less dangerous exercise.
