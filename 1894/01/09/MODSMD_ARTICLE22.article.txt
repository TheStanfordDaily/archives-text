An advanced lecture course in Evo
lution will be given by Dr. Jordan if a
sufficient number indicate their inten
tion of taking up tlie work. The lec
tures will deal principally with the
practical application of evolution, iind

will be open only to those who have
taken the elementary course. This is a
rare opportunity for specalists in evo
lution. l)r. Jordan ranks high among
the leaders in evolutionary thought, and
the chances of coming in cont ct. with a
man eminent in his department should
not be neglected by anyone. The in
spiration gained by studying under the
guidance of a promiueut man is worth
more than all the exact knowledge that
inriy be gained from instructors who,
though excellent teachers, are yet un
known.
