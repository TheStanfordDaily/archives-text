# To Protect the Salmon on this Coast.
## 
### 
The faculty and students are siguing
a petition addressed to the Senate and
House of Representatives of the United
States, which represents that during
ilie past twelve years the salmon indus
try of the coast has amounted to
4,156,751 cases, at a minimum value of
$16,627,004, not including salted and
smoked salmon. The fisheries extend
fr mi 55 D to 05° 25 north latitude,
liorc are located 34 canneries, erected
at a cost of §25,0(J0 to 850,0 0.
Though the number of canneries has
increased in Alaska in the last three
yet the output from earlier loca
tions has actually diminished. The
reason is that there are fewer salmon
Their numerical falling off is due to
the fact that the small streams and
rivers up which the salmon go to spawn
arc guarded with nets, fish racks, and
other appliances to stop them from run
ning up to the spawning grounds.
The petition prays for the enactment
of such legislation as will check these
abuses. This is doue in every civilized
country in the world. The author of
the movement is Robt. D. Hume, one
of the most intelligent and progressive
canuers on the coast.
