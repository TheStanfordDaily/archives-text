# Course in Clay Modelling.
## 
### 
A new course—crediting two hours —
in modelling in clay is offered this se
mester to all who have had Drawing 2,
or its equivalent. Students must pro
vide clay and tools. I do not know
whether or not modelling clay can be
gotten hereabouts, but presume any
terra cotta works or potteries there are
in San Francisco or San Jose could sup
ply it. The time will be arranged as
well as possible to suit the majority
taking it. B. C. Bliown.
