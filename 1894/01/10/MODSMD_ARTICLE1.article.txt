# PROF. MILLER'S LECTURE.
## Johann Joachim Winckelmann. 
### 
The ninth day of December is always
celebrated in the German Uuiversity of
Halle. The studeuts in archaeology
take the lead in the ceremonies. In
my day we secured a hall, went early
and stayed late, and enjoyed ourselves
as only German students can. We had
burlesques, we had tragedy, aud an in
finite number of reta. plays, or tests.
Some one great subject, however, w s
treated in all eamestuess, and the last
Winckelminnism at which L had the
pleasure of being present, the same
subject was discussed which 1 shall
dwell upon tonight. My inspiration is
drawn from that occasion and my ma
terial, for the most part, from Lessing.
Johann Joachim Winckelmann was
born December 9, 1717, at Stendal,
His pareuts being very poor,
Winckelmann, in his early years, ex
perienced great difficulties iu obtain
ing such an education as he desired.
By means of singing from door to door
and by teaching childreu he managed
to attend a Latin school in his native
village. He had to labor both for him
self and his feeble parents, so his youth
was a struggle with the bitterest pov
erty. Education in those days was in a
sore way. Latin was taught only in a
scholastic manner. The whole town
possessed only two specimens of Greek
•classics. A book on architecture aud
statues aroused his greatest ambitions
lor the study of archaeology. He be
yan investigations aud fouud in his
neighborhood what were calhd the
graves of giants (buried statues) In
his great desire to learn Greek he
w ilked vast distances for books.
By acting as amanuensis to an old
rector he managed to get enough school
ing to allow him to attend, in 1837, a
gymnasium at Berlin. In the follow
ing year he entered the Uuiversity of
Halle, where he studied theology, he
also studied German history, Greek lit
erature, and medicine. He read a great
deal At twenty-six he obtained his
first public position as assistant rector
of a school at Seehatisen, which fora
man of his ability was almost degrading.
Repairing to Dresden, he located as
librarian to Count Herr Y r on Buenan, of
whose library be made good use. His
studies aroused in him the desire to
visit Rome, and after a long interval
occasioned by his refusal to become a
catholic, lie at last yielded to this faith
and went to Rome.
His earliest work was his publication
of a book entitled "The Ideas and the
Motives of Greek Works of Art." This
was followed by an anonymous criticism
of the work and then by a counter crit
icism These three works called public
attention to the rising young author,
for such compositions had not been
produced iu a generation. He was uow

io receipt of a small pension of $130 a
year, which enabled him to visit Rome.
There, with the help of Raphael, he
acquired an unequaled education in
Roman anti<juities. From 1758 to
1702 he visited the buried cities of
Herculaneum and Pompeii, and from
him scholars received their first real
information about these antiquities. In
1704 appeared his masterpiece, the
"Geschichte der Kunst des Alter
thuins." It at once took a permanent
place in the literature of Europe. He
sets forth in it the history of Grecian
art and its principles as he understood
them.
Coming with his artistic sense
into the presence of those j>reat
statues of the gods, they revealed
themselves to him as they had revealed
themselves |to Homer centuries before.
His fine description of them belongs to
literature as well as science. They
rank among the gems of the German
language. Wiuckelmanu's supremacy
was now undisputed. He was ap
pointed superintendent of all the great
museums ol Rome, and received flatter
ing offers of positions in Germany as
inducements for him to return. At
last, in 1708, he yielded, and after a
short visit to his native couutry was
returning to Rome when he was assas
inated by a chance acquaintance and
robbed of some gold medals which had
been preseuted to him.
His own history of art is his greatest
monument. The noblest artists of those
days were inspired by him, and his
work is considered an accomplishment
of humanity His life is full of lessons
for us all. He did well that which he
had to do.
