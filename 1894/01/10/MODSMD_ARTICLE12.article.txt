A meeting of the Associated Stu
dents and one or two important class
meetings have been called [for the pres
ent week. The members of these dif
ferent organizations should endeavor to
be present at the time appointed. Last
semester several ineffectual attempts
were made to have meetings, and the
lack of attention caused considerable
trouble. It is necessary that the run
ning business of any organization
should be promptly attended to, and it
is obvious that this cannot te done un
less the members go to the meetings.
Every student should take enough in
terest in University affairs to attend at
least the first meetings of the semester,
as important business has to be trans
acted. The students that complain of
the poor way in which affairs are run
are marly always those who do no work
to better them.
