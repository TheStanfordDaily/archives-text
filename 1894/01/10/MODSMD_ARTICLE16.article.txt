# COLLEGE EXPENSES
## A 						Comparative Estimate of the Cost at Various Institutions. 
### 
A pamphlet has recently been
issued by the secretary of Harvard
University giving letters from forty re
ceut graduates who were compelled
while in college to live as closely as pos
sible. From these letters he concludes
that it is possible fur a student to go
through Harvard at an aunual expend
iture considerably less than the four
hundred and fifty dollars given by the
catalogue as the normal minimum. Of
course this estimate is far below the
average, which is probably higher at
Cambridge than at most American insti
tutions.
The Yale catalogues estimate the an
nual expenses of a student at from $350
to $1025. One would be obliged to
live very closely in order to reach the
minimum given above, but it is very
easy to surpass the maximum estimate.
Six hundred dollars is a fair average
estimate of expenses at Yale.
The U. of M. calendar gives as the
average three hundred and seventy-live
dollars, which is a very fair estimate.
3lany men get through on two hundred
and fifty, or even less. Eight to nine
iiuudred dollars is a high maximum
average for the U. of M.
The Cornell register gives as a mini
mum average $325, which is rather low.
Five hundred dollars is a fair average
fir Cornell. This would allow at least
one hundred dollars for expenses that
are not stric'ly necessary.
