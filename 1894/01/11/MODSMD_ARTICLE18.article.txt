Editor Daily Palo Alto.
Dear Sir: I wish to call the attention
of the student body to the farcical
method of electing the editor of the
Sequoia. As it is, the editor is chosen
by a board of directors whose chief
quali6eation for the office, as far as I
have been able to ascertain, consists in
being a member of some fraternity.
The members of the editorial staff of
the paper, those who have given both
their time and talent with the view of
making a paper of which the students
of the University might feel proud,
have no voice in the matter whatever.
I would suggest that the student
body, at its next meeting, arrange to
have the editor elected by the active
members of the stuff of the paper.
A Student.
