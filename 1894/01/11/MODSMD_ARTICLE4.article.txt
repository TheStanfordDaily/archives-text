# Fifteen Hour Rule.
## 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto.
Will you please elucidate through
your columns the new "fifteen hour
rule"? If a student gets one condition
and one failure during a semester, and
in the following half-ye ir the former is
made up while the latter remaines
against him, is he prevented from tak
ing more than fifteen hours thereafter,
unless the work in which he has failed
is satisfactorily made up? Again, if a
studentjias one failure marked against
him, will that debar him from graduat
ing, even if he an excess of 120
hours to his credit? G. N.

[In answer, we reprint the revised
rule regarding registration. What is
not clear in it may be found explained
in the statement by the registrar fol
lowing it. —Ed.]
No credit will be allowed lor work
not registered on the student's regis
tration card, except by special permis
sion of the faculty, and no petition for
such credit will be considered when
such permission would give the student
more than eighteen hours credit for the
semester. Fifteen hours constitute an
average semester's work. Students who
wish to register for less than thirteen
or more than eighteen hours must ob
tain the written approval of the major
professor and of the professor of hygiene;
but no student who has failed in any
subject in the semester immediately
preceding, or who has any mark of
condition standing agaiust him, will be
allowed to register for more than fifteeu
hours except by special vote of the
faculty through the appropriate com
mittee.

If a student fails to make up a condi
tion within one semester after it is in
curred he must either treat it as a fail
ure, or else bring his hours down to
fifteen,
In order to graduate a student must
have 120 hours credit, and also be re
commended by his major professor as
having completed the required work
(lorty hours) in major and minor sub
jects. The fact that he had sometime
failed in a subject not included in the
necessary major and minor work would
have no bearing in the matter.
