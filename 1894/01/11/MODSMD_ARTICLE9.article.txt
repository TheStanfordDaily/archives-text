[The members of the Sequoia Board
are elected by the several class organ
izations which they represent. The
fact that the preseut membership hap
pened to be chosen from such a source
would argue that the electors in each
particular case deemed the choice made
one of individual merit. In all fairness,
it cannot be considered otherwise when
the relation of fraternity to non-frater
nity members in the University is le>B
than a ratio of one to five.
In the method you advocate there
seems to be little chance for the student
body to have any choice in the matter
of selecting an editor, while much
greater opportunity might be given for
an editor once in office to so choose his
staff that ho could control the position
for his successor. â€”Ed.]
