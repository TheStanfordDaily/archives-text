The reduction of credit for military
drill from two hours to one and the ap
pearance of but five applicants for the
course this semester tells the tale of the
military department. More liberal con
cessions were made to this department
in the way of encouragements offered
for the work than to any other depart
ment in the University.
The fact that a registration of over a
hundred should have so materially de
creased can be explained in no other
way than that the average Stanford stu
dent does not care for military drill, and
will take the course only to secure cred
it with less than the usual expendi
ture of effort.
