As as example of the diligence used
by the great newspapers in the search
for news, may be ei'ed the case of the
death of the night-watchman at the
mausoleum Thursday morning. The
Examiner apprised its special corres
pondent of the fact, who wrote up the
occurence before any news concerning
the affiiir was known among those who
live and attend college less than half a
mile from the pecne of the sad event.
Such is the result of an intense compe
tition among large city dailies, and the
modern facilities for the transportation
of news.
