# Put the Track in Condition.

The oval remains in its familiar con
dition because the anticipated surplus
in the athletic treasury does not exist.
It would seeiu that three years' of
waiting upon a source of revenue which,
while it is fairly reliable in itself, yet is
only adequate to the expenses of the
different varsity teams, would teach a
lesson of non-dependence and self
activity.
If Stanford track athletes are ever to
be victorious over the U. C. in this
single intercollegiate contest in which
they have not yet proved themselves
superior the student body must arise to
the emergeucy and provide means for
the improvement of the track. Until
the men here have been given as good
opportunities as other track athletes
have for training there can be no hope
of their excelling in that branch of
athletics, nor can the result of a con
test with outside teams be taken as a
true measure of ability when those con
testing have been heavily handicapped
by lack of training grounds.
Several important moves could be
made which would set the ball rolling.
The Athletic Board, as apart of their
duty, should act as the prime movers in
devising means to the end desired. A
captain of the track athletic team should
be elected. No objection ought to be
made to a more or less detailed publica
tion of athletic receipts and expeuses
for the year, that the student body may
know just how matters stand.
There are two hundred more stu
dents in the University than there were
at this time last year. It was not new
material that appeared on the track to
represent Stanford in the iutercollegiate
contest last April. Only those who had
some training before coming to college
had the courage to attempt to build
themselves up under circumstances
which discouraged all but those who
were not novices
With proper facilities, especially for
sprinters and runners, there need be
no fear that with two years training
the present untried material here could
be relied upon to uphold the Stanford
supremacy, which is lacking in this
respect alone.
