# The 						Habitual Borrower.
## 
### 
A numerous and little respected
class of persons are the habitual bor
rowers; persons who their
friends (if habitual borrowers have
friends), and those about them, for
articles of daily use. As the Univer
sity is a minature world made up 01 all
sorts and conditions of men, it is not
surprising that the borrower should be
found within its walls. Here he finds
conditions particularly favorable for his
operations. It is very easy to obtain a
lexicon, an instrument, or other article
that he may wish to use, of his neigh
bor across the hall or on the next floor.
Many men, especially in college, de
pend upon others for their daily news
without reflecting that such a course is
fair neither to themselves, the owner of
the paper, or the college paper itself.
The circle from which a college paper
can draw subscribers is necessarily re
stricted and any student who feels the
necess'ty of obtaining the news of his
institution should be willing to the
small sum necessary to obtain a copy of
the paper.â€”Cornell Daily Sun.
