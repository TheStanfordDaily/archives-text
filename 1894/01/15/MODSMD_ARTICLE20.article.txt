For nearly three years the students
of the University have been the vic
tims of high livery rates to and fntni
the adjacent railroad stations. Through
the influence of competition the rate to
Mayfield has come down to a fair figure,
but the same old price still obtains on
the Palo Alto lines. It is surprising
that some enterprising student docs not
take the affair in hand and settle the

matter to his own as well as to the ad
vantage of the student body, by running
a five cent liue. It would be folly for
an outsider to attempt this scheme, as
the compauies now running would
easily force him out by meetiug the cut
temporarily. A. student, however,
would undoubtedly receive the full
support of fellow students and faculry.
