Princeton and U of P. are trying to
form a league to promote track athletics
in the two universities.
The northwestern intercollegiate ath
letic association—made up of Michigan,
Northwestern, Wisconsin, and Minne
sota Universities —has disbanded. It

count of the lone distance to be trav
elled by the teams, and the college ath
letic association could no longer stand
the drain on their funds.
