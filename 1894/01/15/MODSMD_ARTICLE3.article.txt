# Roble's Reception to the Ladies.
## 
### 
The young ladies of Roble were "at
home" to all the ladies of the Univer
sity, Saturday evening. The invitation
was well responded to, and the fancy
costumes made a scene of gayety. The
c lief feature of the evening's enter
r linment was a mock marriage cele
bration which afforded much amuse
ment. Dancing was enjoyed until a
late hour.
