# First Practice of the Season.
## 
### 
The baseball game Saturday between
the first aud second nines was chiefly
interesting because it was the first of
the season. The uutuber of strikeouts,
twenty-five, clearly showed the length
of titue since the men have faced a
pitcher. On account of the weak bat
ting the infielders did not have much to
do. The chauces were not handled as
cleanly as they will be after a month's
practice. The miserable ground also
prevented good work
But five fly-balls went to the out
field during the game. Sheehan made
a good catch in centre field, and Young,
in the same position for thesecoud nine,
captured two high flies. The only
player of the second team to show Var
sity form in general playing was
McLaine. lie made two of the three
hits for his side.
The game came near being a repeti
tion of last season's defeat of the Var
sity by the second nine.
The score was a tie in the eighth inn
ing, each side having three runs, but
the winning run for the first team came
in on a dropped third strike.
The score:
VARSITY.
