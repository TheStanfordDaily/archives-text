# PROF. LE CONTE'S ADDRESS.
## The
						Relation of the Church to Modern Science. 
### 
We have all heard of the contest be
tween the church and science For
many decades science aud religtou have
been at war. From every battle science
seems to have come out victorious; and
yet from every defeat the church has
come out stronger and purer. It is of
this purifying, vivifying power of
science over religion and religion over
science that I wish to speak today.
There was a time not many decades
ago when every department of scieuee
was separate and governed by its own
laws. Now all laws are consistent with
nature. Science works by methods
which she clearly understands and sup
plies. The introduction of a great uew
idea necessitates a readjustment of
many of our laws ar.d beliefs. Even
now we are in the throes of the re
adjustment known as the science ot
evolution.
The idea of God.—The growth of
this idea was marked by three stages:
First, that God was a man like our
selves; second, that he was kinglike, as
well as manlike; third, that he was im
mauent, resident in man. The laws of
nature are but the action of his ener
gies; without him nothing could fora
moment he. This is a common view.
in the same category as the idea of
God comes the question of natural aud
supernatural. vVhen we clearly con
ceive the idea of God immanent in nat
ure, the whole distinction between nat
ural and supernatural disappears from
view, and with it disappears the idea of
inir cles, as we usually understand them.
A miracle is simply impossible, because
law, physical and moral, is the expres
sion of the essential na'ure and perfec
tion of God. It is as impossible for
God to perform a miracle as it is for
him to lie. Miracles are possible only
under laws higher than are yet known.
Mode of Creation —In the beginning
there was the creation of the universe,
and then there was rest. This was the
old idea Evolution has taken its place
in ruodnrn thought. If the universal
law of gravitation is true then it is not
less certain that the universal law of
evolution is a divine process of creation.
Every work of the mind, whether
human or divine, is in some sense an
image of the worker. All that i.> high
est in us is like God Love is divine;
carried up to infinite strength it be
comes the love of God; so with reason,
power, and knowledge. The idea of
man—l can see no reason, scientific or
religious, wity some modern scientists
refuse to accept the evolution of man's
► pirit with the evolution of man's body
If the latter compels us to admit evo
lution, then also the class relationship
of man's mind with all its faculties
ought to compel us to admit the simi
lar origin of the human spirit.
Doctrine of the Christ—[verbatim.]
We have thus briefly touched on the
question of man's origin. We come
now to speak of the goal or ideal toward
which lie ever strives. This brings
me to still more delicate grouud. Shall
1 go on ?
"What think ye, then, of Christ '( '
This is indeed a grave question and we
ou<iht gravely to meet it. Does science,
and especially evolution, have anything
to say on this question also? 1 think
it does. Now 1 do not, of course, ex

pect. to construct a complete ecientitic
Christology. I only wish to state my
own views of the bearing of evolution
ou this great question According to
my view, then, as organic evolution
reached its goal and completion in man,
so man, taking up the ouvvard process
on a higher plane, reaches by evolution
his goal and completion in the ide-d
man—the Christ. Observe, I say the
Christ. Who is the Christ is another
and different question, of which I shall
speak later According to this view
the Christ, whatever else aud more we
may think him, is the ideal rnau and
therefore—mark the implication —and
therefore the divine man. We are all
as men (as contradistinguished from
brutes), we are all, I say sons of God —
the Christ is the "well beloved Son."
We are all as men in the image of God.
fie i-i the express, the perfect image.
We are as men partakers in various de
grees of the divine nature. In him the
divine nature is completely realized.
It is not necessary that the ideal man
should be perfect in knowledge or in
finitc in power. On the contrary he
must grow in wisdom aud stature like
other men, l'or he is the Son of Man,
the representative of humanity. But
he must be perfect in character, for it
is a moral ideal. Character is esseu
tially spirit. All else—even know
ledge—is but environment for its
culture. In the blaze of the light, of
modern science w.e are apt to forget
this. Character is the altitude of the
human spirit toward the Divine Spirit.
If I should add anything to this defini
tion I would say that it is spiritual
attitude and spiritual energy. In
the Christ this attitude must be wholly
right The harmony, the union of the
human spirit, with the Divine Spirit
must be perfect. This perfect union
gives of necessity also fullness of spir
itual energy.
L fear you may think I am treading
on holy ground. But no ground is too
holy to be trodden by Reason if only in
reverent spirit* with shoes removed. I
have gone so far that I must go on. I
dare not stop without explaining myself
more fully. L wish especially to show
that although the Christ must be human
—yes, more intensely human than any
one of us—yet by the law of evolution
we ouiiht to expect him to differ from
us in an almost inconceivable degree
and in a superhuman way. This 1
show as follows:
We have said that the Christ is the
ideal man and therefore the divine man;
that he is the goal and completion of
humanity. Hut in evolution a goal is
not only a completion of one stage but
also the beginning of another and
higher stage—on a higher plane of life,
with new and higher powers and capa
bilities unimaginable from any lower
plane. Let me now illustrate.
As man is the goal and completion—
the ideal—of animal evolution and yet
is he also a birth into a new and higher
plane of life —the spiritual. So the
Christ, the ideal man, may be only the
goal and completion of human evolutiou
and yet is he also a birth into a new
and higher plane of life, the Divine.
As the human spirit pre-existed in
embryo in animals, slowly developing
through all geological times until it
came to birth and immortality in man,
so the divine spirit is now in embryo in
man in various degrees of development
and cottus to birth and completeness of
divine life in the Christ.

As animals reached conscious rel
ations with God in the appearance of
man even so man reaches union with
God in the Christ.
As man, the ideal of animal evolu
tion, is a union of the animal with the
spiritual, so the Christ, the ideal of hu
man evolution, is the union of the
human and the divine. Hut observe,
in both cases the change is not by the
introduction of any new element, but
by the coming birth into a higher
sphere of an element previously exist
ing in embrjo in the lower plane.
As with the appearance of man
there were new powers and properties
unimaginable from the animal point of
view and therefore from that point of
view supernatural, i.e., above the ani
mal natures, ought we not to expect
that with the appearance of the Christ
there should be also new powers and
properties unimaginable from the hu
man point of view and therefore to us
seeming supernatural, i.e., above our
natures and yet now wholly unimagiu-.
able.
Thus far I have spoken of analogies
between animal and human evolution,
and shown that in both the ideal tran
scends the plane from which it sprang.
J3ut now I must draw attention to a dif
ference even amounting to a contrast.
In organic evolution the goal and ideal
comes and can come only at the end.
In human evolution 011 the contrary
ideals come, if they eome at all, in the
course. There is a difference in this re
gard between the two kinds of evolution
which is fundamental Let uie explain.
In addition to all the factors of or
ganic evolution, there is a human evo
lution a new and higher factor which
immediately takes precedence of all
others. This factor is the conscious
voluntary cooperation of the spirit of
man in the work of its own evolution.
Now observe, the method of this new
factor consists especially in the forma
tion and especially in the pursuit of
ideals. In organic evolution species
are transformed by the environment.
In human evolution character is trans
formed by its own ideals. Organic
evolution is by necessary law. Human
evolution is by voluutary effort, i. e.,
by free law. Organic evolution is by a
pushing upward and onward from be
low and behind. Human evolution is a
pulling upward and onward from above
and in front by the attractive force ol
ideals. Thus the ideal or goal of or
ganic evolution cannot come in till the
end, while the attractive and transform
ing ideals of human evolutiou must
come, wnether only in the imagination
or realized in the flesh, but come some
how in the course. Now the most
powerfully attractive ideal ever prt
sented to the human mind and therefore
the most potent factor in the evolution
of the human character is the Christ.
This ideal must come —whether only in
the imagination or in the flesh—but
must come somehow in the course and
not at the end only. At the end the
whole human race must reach that
ideal, must reach the fullness of the
stature of the Christ. But how can
tins be unless (except) by the attractive
force of the ideal already conic some
how in the course. The right way of
life must be revealed in the ideal, the
Christ, before man can fo'lowand trans
form his character thereby.
The Christ as thus defined, i.e., as
the perfect ideal man, may we not re
gard him as a true object of natural

worship? There are two aud only two
fundamental moral principles, love to
God and love to man. Both ought to be
embodied iu a rational worship. In
Christianity the one is embodied in the
worship of an Infinite Spirit, God, the
other in the worship of an ideal man,
the Christ.
Hat now conies the last, the burning
question, but distinctly a different ques
tion, a question not of science but of
history. Has the Christ ever come any
otherwise than in the imagination of an
ideal'/' lias he ever come in the flesh?
In a word, is Jesus of Nazareth the
Christ?
Let it be admitted that he was not
perfect in knowledge, (lie himself
said, ''Of that day and hour kaoweth
no man, not even the Son, but the
Father only ") nor in power (He felt
humau weakness like the rest of us, and
prayed to be delivered.) Let it be ad
mitted then that he increased in wis
dom and in stature like other men.
But in character—in the perfect Tight
ness of his spirit to the Divine spirit—
who has been able to find any defect?
May we not then accept him as the
Christ? As the best ideal we know or
can conceive? And since ideals are the
necessary agents in the elevation of
character, arc we not bound to accept
him of our leader, as the captain of our
salvation?
But it has been objected that all
ideals are partial and temporary, that
we are in fact drawu onward and up
ward by a succession of ideals and be
yond another in the course. Ideals are
but milestones which we put succes
sively behind us, while we Drees for
ward to another. They are but
rounds of a ladder, which wo put suc
cessively beneath us while we rise
higher and higher. This one also of
Jesus we shall eventually put behind
and beneath us, when it has served its
purpose of lifting us to its own level.
To this I answer. Admitted that in
many ways such, indeed, is the course
of progress, but who has been able to
reacli this ideal and propose a higher?
VVlien this one is reached in our own
personal character it will be time
enough to think of putting it behind
and seeking another.
Again, it is true that in many ways
we have advanced and are still advanc
ing by means of a succession of partial
ideals. But this use of partial ideals is
itself only a temporary stage of evolu
tion. At a certain stage we must catch
glimpses at least of the absolute moral
ideal. Thenceforward our gaze be
comes fixed and we arc drawn upward
forever. The human race has already
reached a stage where the absolute
moral ideal is attractive. This divine
ideal can never again be lost to
humanity.
