It is gratifying to note the estab
lishment of a civil engineers' club.
Since the death of the engineering so
ciety there has been no organiz it'on
that represented in any way the large
body of engineering students. We feel
sure that the present club, differing in
material ways from the old society, will
be entirely successful. It has a strong
body of officers composed of meu who
wiii do their utmost to make the ciub
a success, Wo wish it a prosperous
and useful career.
