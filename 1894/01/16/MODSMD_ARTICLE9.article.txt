The enterprise in the student body
of Kncina Hall is again brought prom
inently to the front by the circulation
of a notice to the eff<;ct that boarders
may be called in time for breakfast by
the payment of twenty five cents a
month. We would suggest that the
originator double the price and contract
to take breakl'ast up to those who find
it difficult to reach the dining-room
before 8 o'clock.
