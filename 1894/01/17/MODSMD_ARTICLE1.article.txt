# A 						Civil Engineers' Club Formed.
## 
### 
The question of the advisability of
organizing a civil engineers' club has
been debated for some time. The
troubled existence and final extinction
of the Engineering Society formed in
'92 supplied many suggestions, audit
was not difficult to find the points of
weakness which finally caused its dis
appearance. There appeared to be a
lack of unity in the work of the mem
bers. A mechanical engineer had no
interest in civil engineering problems;
still less had the electrical engineer.
This dift'urence in object desired made
it desirable to unite into one club only
those taking the same course.

membership. The constitution, how
ever, limits the number of active mem
tew, as it is hoped in this way to re
tain only those who are thoroughly
interested in the meetings of the club
