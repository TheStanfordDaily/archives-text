An exceptionally important duty de
volves upon the newly elected Board of
Athletic Directors. They have entered
upon the discharge of their duties with
a depicted treasury and with baseball
and track affairs in a sadly demoralized
condition. A field-day with Berkeley
is inevitable, and the Board should take
steps immediately to give our athletes a
track on which to train. Baseball can
hold its own. The Board should sacri
fice everything to the development of a
strong track athletic team.
