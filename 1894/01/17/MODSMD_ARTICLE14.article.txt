The gift of Lieutenant Oyster, noted
on the first page of this issue, is only the
last of many generous endeavors by that
gentleman to further musical as well as
military iuterests at the University.
His efforts have not. been given the sup
port or eucouragement of the students
at any time. Only a few are aware of
the actual time and money spent by
Lieut. Oyster in trying to put a military
organization on a firm standing here.
The Band instruments which have just
been presented to the University cost
near ยง800 and the value of the music
used by the organization is in the neigh
borhood of 3150.
