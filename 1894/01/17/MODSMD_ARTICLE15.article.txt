Those who attended the University
during the first year of its existence
will well remember the enthusiasm with
which the Student's Congress was car
ried on. With a membership roll of
nearly two hundred it was predominant
among the student organizations. But
it is needless to state that after eking
out a struggling existence during the
greater part of last year, it has ceased to
be. Sophomoric sparring matches were
allowed to be carried on during the ses
sion and thus lessened the desire to
learn. The infusion of the dangerous

element of politics in filling the offices
was also one of the potent causes of its
demise.
Although the first venture has
proved a failure should be made
an attempt to place the organization
on its feet The influences of a mock
congress are far more practical to those
enjoying them than membership in any
other form of forensic organization could
ever be. The committee system and other
machinery of a congress transport the
speaker from the narrow bounds of a
high school debating club to place him
upon the floor of a political institution
in miniature where he may acquire
knowledge of practical legislation.
