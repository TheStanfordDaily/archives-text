# Last Night's Concert.
## 
### 
The largest audience ever gathered
within the chapel witnessed the concert
given by the Faculty Musical Club
last night. The program was interest
ing and varied.
Mrs. A. W. Smith sang two num
bers with the artistic attention to nuance
that always marks her singing. In re
sponse to an encore she sang a very
pretty setting of the equisite lyric "Un
der the Greenwood Tree," from "As
You Like It."
Mrs. H. li Lathi op, who is a most
welcome addition to our limited num
ber of vocalists, sang F. Clay's ballad,
"She Wandered Down the Mountain
Side." She possesses a mezzo-soprano
voice of considerable compass—true,
winsome, and pure. Charm and ele
gance were evident in her singing. She
was rewarded with most enthusiastic
applause, and in return she sang a
pretty little ballad.
Mrs. Pease gave a very good inter
pretation of both the first nocturne of
Chopin's opus no. 37, and Schubert's
second Moment Musical.
Chopin's work, especially the Noc
turnes, should uever be played in strict
metronomac time. The tempo rubato,
which all of Chopin's music demands, is
seldom understood by pianists of other
nationalities than the Slavic, because it
a Slavic characteristic. Rubato liter
ally means robbed, and therefore it is
usually supposed that this characteristic
of Chopiu's style consists only of pro
longing certain notes in a bar at the ex
pense of others. Hut it also includes,
to a large extent, the frequent unex
pected changes of tempo and rhythm,
and those unique passages, first con
ceived by Chopin, in which the right
hand has to play an irregular number of
small note-, say twenty-three, while the
left hand plays only nine or twelve. It

is in such passages that Chopin hps
clearly indicated that musical bar is but
a mere mechanical measure and does
not sufficiently indicate the phrasing of
his idea.
Mrs. Pease played the beautiful
fioriture, which abounds in the Noc
turne, very satisfactorily.
Miss L. Fletcher gave two numbers
upon the violin. Her playing is char
acterised by quietness and refinement of
phrasing, rather than by breadth and
vigor.
Miss E Lowell and Mr. Campbell
also contributed to the program.
