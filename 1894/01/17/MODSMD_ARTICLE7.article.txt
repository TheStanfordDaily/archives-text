The prospect that the postoffice of
Stanford University will be raised from
the fourth class to the third class brings
up the question of the qualifications for
the different classes. A postoffice of
the first-class is one in which the an
nual gross receipts are $40,000 and up
wards; a second-class office is one whose
annual gross receipts are between $8,000
and 840,000; a third class office is one
which has annual receipts of from
81,000 to $8,000; and all others are
fourth-class.
The president appoints the first, sec
ond, and third class postmasters and the
postmaster-general appoints the post
masters for the fourth class offices.
