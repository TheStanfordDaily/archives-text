# Dr. Jordan on Boys Who Smoke Cigarettes.
## 
### 
As a college teacher my experience
with boys who have formed the cigar
ette habit is somewhat limited. It,
however, confirms me in the opinion
that such boys arc like wormy apples:
they drop long before harvest time.
Very few of them ever advance far
enough to enter college. Very few ot
those who enter last beyond the first
year. They rarely make failures in
after life, because they do not have any
after life. The boy who begins cigar
ette smoking before he is fifteen never
enters the life of the world. When
the other boys are taking hold of the
world's work he is concerned with the
sexton and the undertaker.
There is one grim argument to bo
made for the use of cigarettes by boys;
it helps on the survival of the fittest.
The manly boy does not take to such
things. He has life in him, plays foot
ball, steals watermelons, goes swimming
on Sundays, hunts ducks—does any
thing but deaden himself with narcotics.
