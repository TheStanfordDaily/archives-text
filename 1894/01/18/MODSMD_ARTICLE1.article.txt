The outlook fora irood athletic team
will he brighter than usual if the
Athletic Board succeeds in devising
some means of finishing the track, now
half complete, or at least putting it in
condition for the men to train on.
Several good athletes have entered the
University this year who will add ma
terially to the strength of the old team.
The most promising of these is 11. W.
Culver, '97. He has a good record as
au all-round athlete and has especially
good records in the high hurdles and
running high and running broad jumps.
Dodge, '96, from the University of
Michigan, is the only new man that has
yet shown up in the sprints, lie has a
go d stride and much is expected of
him.
Stanford will be well represented" in
the sprints, as she was last year, but in
the mile walk we have lost the Timrn
brothers and have no record breakers
in that line. Feruald, last year's cap
tain, who waf seriously handicapped
last season by a sprained knee, has left
the University, and his loss be
greatly felt. G. Calhoun, holding the
University 2-U-yard record, has also
left and will not return until uext year
In the field events all the material
will have to be greatly developed before
anything can be expected from that
quarter.
Several of the heavy football men
should do well at putting the shot or
throwing the hammer. McMillan, in
particular, has shown up well in the
shot-put and should be kept at it.
Crane is still the only man in the
University to attain any height at pole
vaulting. Several new men have
shown up in the high jump.
Besides Brown, Maynard, and Fry,
no one has shown any intention of en
tering for the distance runs.
