The meeting of the sophomore class
held yesterday afternoon was almost au
insult to the second year tudents. From
a parliamentary point of view it was a
complete farce. Three out of every
four who addressed the chair never left
their seats, while some even did not
condescend to address the chair at all,
but blurted out their motions as if they
were coaching a football team, where
noise and fun were the only requisites
for success. It would be well for some
of the Class of '96 to take a course in
parliamentary procedure; in fact they
could learn much from their freshman
friends.
