The result of the recent re-examina
tion for students deficient in entrance
requirement English lb (a test of abil
ity in English composition) is an
example of the larpe proportion of stu
dents who come to the University
without proper or adequate training
in expressing themselves in the lan
guage that thay must, daily use. Until
the preparatory schools realize the im
portance of English composition tnere
will continue to be a large number of
students in the University who, while
perhaps thoroughly capable as students,
know no more about English composi
tion and punctuation than the average
twelve-year-old child.
