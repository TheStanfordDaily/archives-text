From the financial statement printed
on the first. page today it will be seen
that the two dormitories under student
management are far superior to the old

order of things under which we labored j
last year, the food, attendance, and
freedom from restraint being appreci
ated by everyone, while as a business
success the present management stands
unquestioned. The first year, with the
price of board and lodging at $20 per
month, the University had to meet a
loss of $10 per student, and as the halls
were crowded, this meant a to'al loss of
$4,3G0, This year with the price at
$20 and with Encina but two-thirds
full, after having met a host of inci
dental expenses at the beginning, the
surplus for December was $867.
Another curious fact in this connec
tion is the over crowded condition of
the young ladies' dormitory. One huc
dred and three are supposed to fill it
completely; yet, at present it contains
one hundred and six. Convenient ac
commodations for young women will fce
very inadequate for next year unless
more buildings are constructed. If the
University would change its rules re
garding the leasing of land to prospec
tive builders the condition of our
campus would be so changed by the
erection of fraternity and dwelling
houses that the unsightly appearance
of that heterogeneous mass of buildings
vaguely termed the "faculty row"
would no longer be such a source of
ridicule and comment for our numerous
visitors.
