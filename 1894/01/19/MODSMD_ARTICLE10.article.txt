Dear Sir: In a recent issue of the
Daily I have noticed discussions on
the running track and on ways and
means of raising the necessary money to
complete it. I would like to propose
the following method. We have hero
in the neighborhood of one hundred to
one hundred and fifty wheelmen and no
suitable track on which to develop the
speedy ones. Now, by combining the
track into a running and cycling track
an opportunity would be afforded tho
wheelmen, who would, I believe, will
ingly contribute their share financially.
