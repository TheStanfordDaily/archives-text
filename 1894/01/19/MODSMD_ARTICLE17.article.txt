Roble Hall as a social centre has
been a potent factor in attempting to
bring together the various elements
that compose our University life. The
reception tomorrow evening is only a
continuation of many such affairs that
have been given not for the select few
but for the social improvement and en
tertainment of such a representative
number as the hall will accommodate.
