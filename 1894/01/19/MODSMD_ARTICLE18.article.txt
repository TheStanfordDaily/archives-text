In view of the prosperous condition
of the halls, as evinced by the report
published in yesterday evening's issue,
we suggest that the needy students who
act as waiters in the halls each be al
lowed at least three dollars per month
in excess of their board, which is the
only remuneration they receive at pres
ent for services that, earlier in the year,
were considered equivalent to twenty
three dollars per month.
