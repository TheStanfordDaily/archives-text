The recent iutcrcollegiate chess
tournament held in the east would seem
to offer a new avenue for amusement at
Stauf'ord. Why not have a chess
tournament out here? Last year a
whist club was organized which did
much to iucrease innocent amusement
and social intercourse. A chess club
would attain both of these ends and be
sides would not whet the appetite—which
is possessed even by college students —
for games of chance. The game of
chess offers true pleasure to any one
who will allow himself to become inter
ested in planning and carrying out
moves and combinations Further
more, its interest is never sullied by the
altercations that always accompany any
game whose main factor of success is
pure chance. Let our enthusiastic
chess players, by some concerted action,
give an impetus to the playing of the
game in the western colleges.
