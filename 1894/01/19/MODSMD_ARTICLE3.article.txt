# Electrical Road to Palo Alto.
## 
### 
The electrical engineering department
has a project on foot which will mater
ially affect the relation of the Univer
sity to Palo Alto, being nothing less
than a proposition to build an electrical
railroad to that place. Numerous plans
have been heretofore suggested by
property owners in Mayfield and Palo
Alto regarding such a road, but the
matter has always fallen through, to the
great disgust of those who bought prop
erty under such representations. Now
it is proposed that the University build
and operate the road.
Prof. Perrine has given out specifica
tions for his class to work up in groups
of two. The plan is to assign different
electrical systems to he reported on at
the end of the semester in lieu of theses,
when thn one best adapted to the sit
uation can be chosen and the details
worked up in the same manner, by the
class. It is thought that by the time
the University is in shape to take

the construction in hand the detail
plans and specifications will be ready.
The engineering and management of
construction will be done entirely by
the engineering departments here. The
surveying will be attended to by the
civil engineering corps and the mechan
ical engineers are to have a share in
the work.
As overhead wires would not har
monize well with the architecture of the
institution, besides being unsightly in
themselves, the endeavor will be to de
cide between systems in which this
feature is eliminated The VVandell-
Kntz storage system has been men
tioned, as also have a number of conduit
systems. One thing is sure, however,
whatever the system may be, it will
contain such modern features as are
most desirable, and will not be out of
harmony with our beautiful drives and
buildings.
The plant is intended to be owned
and run by this institution, and will
certainly be a paying investment as
well as a great convenience to those
who wish to live in Palo Alto and at the
saiue time attend the University recita
tions aud lectures.
