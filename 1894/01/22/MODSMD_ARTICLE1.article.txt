### 
[A l'ttle over two years ago, when
I was here for the first time, two audit
ors were sitting before me who are ab
sent today. One will be absent forever;
it was Senator Stanford, who has gone,
I believe, to the realms of everlasting
light. The other was his wife who
now stands alone, and in gratitude
comes in her widowhood and with firm
ness aud courage nob'y perseveres in
his work, and makes this great institu
tion the child of her care and her affec
tions |
In the thirty-eighth chapter of Job
God asks tlie question: "Where wast
thou when I laid the found ition of tlie
earth?" A great deal has been talked
about Job, the man, siuce the book was
written. Job was a scientific man of
great learning for his time, he had
traveled; he had seen the pyramids be
fore they were defaced by relic hunters;
he had seen the hippopotamus sport in
the Nile and called it the Nile horse; he
had seen the great sharks of the In
dian Ocean. Among other things Job
was a naturalist, lie speaks of Orion,
the Pleiades, ami the Great Hear, and
watched theiu travel across the heavens
in majestic succession. Job was an .s
-tronomer.
Hut something happened to Job and
his science was all baffled. There
wis absolutely nothing in the region of
human knowledge that he might take
hold of and say ''Assist me." lie was
in trouble; bis heart was being torn
asunder by grief. Now, Job was a
kind man. lie was a father to the
blind; he was generous to the poor
Yet, because of this, Satan said to the
Lord, "Try him. There is no man on
the earth who will not become tempted
il you try him." So God permitted
the sacrifice, and Job's children were
killed and his possessions were taken
away. With one revolution of the
wheel of fortune Job was reduced to
the condition of a pauper with nothing
left to him but his wife —and she both
ered him.
1 have often wondered what science
prevails in such conditions. I believe
the story teaches an important truth,
namely, that there are certain condi
tions in life in which application to
science avails absolutely nothing. You
must go to religion. God is an anchor
against all the storms of misfortune.
This lesson was taught to Job, who was
a great, scientist. It came to him in
his trouble when he had nothing but
his wife who asked him to curse God
as the author of his misfortunes. Hut
he attributed no injustice to God.
When he applied to God, He asked him
one question, "Where wast thou when
I created the world?"
Whether the world was created five
thousand years ago, or back an infinite
period, it was breathed into existeiu'e
by a great being. Three fundamental

facts testify to the almighty personal
ity—will, consciousness and intelligence.
In our day we are marching at a terri
ble rate. Over the door of your col
ege here might fitly be written the
words ot Solomon, ''Wisdom, thou art
my sister." You are living in a time
when you are required to go the whole
way or not at all. If you are ready to
exclaim with Kepler, "These laws are
the designs of a Deity!" you are upon
safe ground. And remember that one
great thing can be learned from r eligion
and science, and that is humility, rev
erence for God and Nature, and ac
knowledgement of our own weakness.
