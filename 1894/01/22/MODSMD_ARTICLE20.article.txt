Immediately after tomorrow even
ing's lecture a tnass meeting will be
held in the chapel to discuss ways and
means of organizing a student guild or

of the faculty have interested them
selves in this matter, which a feeling
of personal pride has too long screened
from the attention that every fair
tninded student must realize it deserves.
