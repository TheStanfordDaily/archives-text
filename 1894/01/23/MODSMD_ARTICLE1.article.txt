# The
						Pioneer Class Holds an Election.
## 
### 
Over one hundred and forty mem
bers of the pioneer class wero present
in the chapel this afternoon at the se
mester's election of officers. This
meeting was in marked contrast to the
one of last week that brought out but
thirty-seven persons. Another inter
esting fact was the presence of nearly
forty youngr ladies. About a dozen
faces that were not familiar to the Class
of '95 in her enthusiastic freshman
days showed that new members have
recently been added to the class. The
meeting was called to order at 1:30 by
President Hinsdill, and nominations
were declared in order for the various
offices.
Chester Magee, in an appeal for
representation of "that large body of
our best students that is so little recog
nized," nominated Thomas Code —a
very evident sui prise and one that
later developments in the election made
more so. Cox placed in nomination J
J 11 ollister, also of the engineering de
partment, and nominations were closed.
Rice nominated Miss Stcffens for
second vice-president; Collins nomi
nated Hoover for treasurer; Miss Hart
ley noniin ited Miss Stadtmuller for his
torian; drove nominated Kd Rea for
baseball manager; Knox nominal,ed
Leadbotter for football manager, but the
nominee declined.
Ewell withdrew his name as candi
date for class council; and Watson
placed Searles in nomination for the
council.
Bancroft nominated Burne'J fori re
cording secretary; and L. Smith nomi
nated Bancroft for football manager.
By motiou the secretary was in

eral offices for which there was but one
