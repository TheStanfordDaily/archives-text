Much inconvenience is often caused
to students in the different laboratories
by the way in which the janitors per
sist in doing their work before the stu
dents have finished study. They in
variably begin some time before five
o'clock without any apparent object but
that of being done a few minutes earlier.
This seems to be wholly needless and
it simply rests with the persons who
have charge of this work to see that
sweeping and dusting are done at the
proper time.
