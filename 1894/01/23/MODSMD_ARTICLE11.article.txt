The excitement produced over the
election of today is a very desirable
feature in studeut body life At no
time in the history of any classes has
such interest been shown in the elec
tion of its presidents as has been
evinced today. This enthusiasm should
be cultivated and nourished, as it adds
greatly to the honor connectcd with the
positions. Without competition the of
fices are often undesirable, and it is
only the pleasure of securijg a victory
that makes a capable man allow his
name to appear as a candidate.
The interest shown has also caused
much energetic electioneering; this is
in no way to be condemned, since it is
the only element in the election that
lends any zest to the work.
If the historians of the classes which
elected their presidents today would
write the history of the combinations
that were behind the scenes, it would
make the most interesting page in all
class history.
