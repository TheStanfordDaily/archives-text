# Summer School in Chemistry.
## 
### 
Owing to a growing demaud for op
portunities to study chemistry in the
laboratory, and influenced partly by the
crowded condition of the laboratories
during the college year, it has been
decided by the chemical department to
establish a summer school in chemistry
during the coming summer. The in
struction will cover a period of eight
weeks, beginning early in June. It is
estimated that during that time it will
be possible for the student to complete
the regular course in elementary chem
istry, and thus to obtain entrance
credit in chemistry and be enabled to
take up the second year courses in the
University. Students who have had
the necessary preparation may pursue
qualitative or quantitative analysis or
organic chemistry, and it is estimated
that the equivalent of at least one sem
ester's regular work in these advanced
topics may be completed during the
eight week's session.
The work of the school will be con
ducted by Mr. Stewart W. Young and
I>r. 11. 0. Meyers, though the other
members of the department will take
part in the instruction. The cost of
the entire course will probably be about
$30, but suitable reduction may be
made to those who devote only a part
of their time to the work.
It is hoped that teachers and others
who are unable to attend the Univer
sity during the regular sessions will
find this summer session a valuable op
portunity. A. more complete announce
ment will appear as soon as practicable.
In the meantime any communications
may be addressed to either of the above
mentioned gentlemen.
