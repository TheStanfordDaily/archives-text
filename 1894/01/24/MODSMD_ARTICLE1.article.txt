# "STANDETH GOD WITHIN THE SHADOW?"
## Dr. Jordan's Lecture. 
### 
The chapel was not only filled some
little time before seven o'clock yester
day evening but nearly two hundred per
sons stood up, wherever there was room,
or listened at the windows, while fully
fifty went away because they could not
get even these accomodations. To the
latter and to others who were unable to
attend the lecture the condensed report
here given may 'furnish some satisfac
tion, but it caunot, embody the personality
of the extemporaneous speaker.
It is true by actual observation that
no one ever accomplished veiy much in
any direction who did not have faith
that, the heart, of the universe is sound
I r, lias been said of a certain man that
he b lieved that there was a power in
the universe strong enough to make
truth telling safe and effective. Essen
tial to all wcrk is a sort of relationship
to the powers that be. This is really a
new form of religion. If you have two
tilings, intelhct in Christianity and the
right relations of all things, then you
have a basis in these fora religion that
is firm and substantial.
it is said that there is no element of
holiness i i the dust that collects upon
the Bib e. Son etimes it is hard to tell
which is the family Ifible and which is
the dust. Now it is the service of
science to religion to brush off this
dust. Almost every young man and
young woman is apt. in some way or
other to get their religious ideas eon-
II eted. To most of them it is true,
i he essential truths of religion are clear
Hut there are parts of religion—a port
of accretion—which do not commend
themselves to them. And they are
often inclined to look upon other parts
of tlie family Bible as being composed
ot dust. Another great service of
science to religion is ihat nothing that
is lalse can be essential to Christianity.
There is an idea that the forces of
nature are bound in some way to ex
ecute human justice, because God is
just and man is, or ought to be, just to
his fellow man. Now this idea of jus
tice being dealt out by the forces of
nature is clearly erroneous All the
laws of nature act with the same force
and ' justice" upon the ureat and the
small alike. Hut this belief has been
kept permanently before young men
and women in a thousand different ways
in spite of admonition Th' re used to
be in our Sunday school libraries books
which told about the good little boy
who always said his prayers and whose
every act was right, and who, long
years afterwards, became the mayor of
London Now he was only awarded
tne pomp and glory that should go to
the man who works for it. Hut in
this kind of books it is always the good
little boy who is successful.
There is the story of (Jenrge Elliot's,
in which the hero thought that trial by
ordeal would always justify all trouble,
because into the hands of Providence it
was given to satisfy all things right
and wrong, You on see that his in
ability to separate the one from the
other was the cause ol his abandoning
all faith in everything.
Many young men and women are
reaching some such faith, and for this

same reason they have been taught to
believe that some things are bound to
occur which are not true. When I was
a little boy 1 had a boat with which I
spent a good deal of time. While I
was sailing it one day the wind blew it
across the pond into the crotch of a log
where I could not get it. Only a
strong north wind would blow it back
again to the opposite side. Now I had
been taught in Sunday school to pray
tor any thing that I wanted. So I
knelt down there in the uiud by the
pond and prayed fora strong north
wind. In the morning I found my
boat blown back to the south side of the
pond. This led me to look into the
matter and I straightway put religion
to a serious test. I matured a plan by
which all religious denominations were
tested, aud Universalism came out ahead.
Bit 1 began to think that after all these
tests of mine were not fair. I longed lor
some inside ''tip" to show upon which
side the powers ot heaven were play
ing; for we know of a great many
wicked people who flourish.
Some years ago a scientist upheld
that there is in nature a mediatory force
which tends always to make a man get
well. Hut another physician said that
there was no such thing as this, because
nature is anxious to hurry men into the
ground. Now you can prove the one
just as*easily as you can prove the other.
A poet has said, '-Truth is forever
upon the scjffnld, wrong forever upon
the throne." Tnat is, nature is morally
indifferent. Thoreau said that after
hearing of some unjust decision in the
matter ot slavery he went out upon the
banks of the pond and found nature
going on just the same.
Then comes the question, are God
and nature at strife? Some will say
yes. God ouirht to hurl his lightning
at the unjust judge Others say:
''Everything goes on just as it happens
to; there is no law in the universe If
there are any laws, every one should
mind its own business." Natuie, in
deed, is no respector of persons. How
could she be otherwise? Twice two is
four to the just and the unjust alike.
Twice two is four to me and to you, and
to the saudbagger when he is counting
his ''earnings."
A warring state of laws in the uni
verse would be a discarding of the
universe, fora broken law would mean
a discarded universe. Hut some one
has said, suppose God should in some
way deliberately break his own laws,
just to show scientitic men that he is
superior to them. Emerson's principle
of life was to "be sound and solvent."
Suppose Emerson, to s'utw men that he
could be independent of his principles,
had gone to Boston on a big spree.
Now should God do something worse,
for he can do nothing better than he
does, there would be a discarded uni
verse.
I»r Yoorsangcr has said that super
stition, in his church at least, arises
from p< etry taken too literally. The
great poetry of Job was thought to be
literally true. YVe might conceive of
any such thing us this happening in a
Jewish church, but of course not in
our more enlightened religious circles.
There is the obligation to what we
call prayer. We may say we nave
prayed tor rain, and no rain came.
Now I believe that no prayer for rain
ever brought rain, yet often we pray for
the many little trifling things we some
times need. Even if you receive any
strength in these prayers they will not

be worth anything to you. Let the
laws of nature move you.
The laws of pleasure and pain, and
gravitation, will act alike upon the
prophet and the rat. All these laws of
God are not in this world for good or
bad. Th ey seem each one to cxecute
iu its own way its own justice, and the
good and bad come in the relation of
man to these laws. The force of human
reaction as a good force indicates how
man can rise through the combination
of all the laws. They are simply nec
essary facts in nature.
r fhus Nature is indifferent to man.
And all her laws are performed in spite
of good or bad, and that force at the
heart of the universe is sound. Hu
man reaction and God will work out its
day. In closing, 1 quote from Lowell:
Truth forever on the scaffold,
Wrong forever on the throne;
Yet that scaffold sways the future,
And. behind the dim unknown,
Standeth God within the shadow,
Keeping .vatch above His own.
