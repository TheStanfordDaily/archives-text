Several months ago two of the En
cina tennis courts were turned over to
the exclusive use of the Tennis Club on
condition that the club should keep all
of the courts in good repair. Judging
from the disgraceful condition of the
courts during the past three months it
would appear that the Tennis Club has
signally failed to comply with its part
of the agreement. The background be
tween the courts and netting should
have been gravelled by the club before
the wet weather set in, and now that we
may reasonably expect, line weather the
improvement should not be delayed.
The committee representing the Ten
nis Club before the Board of Athletic
Directors at the time their proposition
was considered also stated that the club
would furnish first-class nets for all the
courts. There has not been a good net
on either of the non-club courts since
the change of management. The old

Athletic Hoard was busied with football
affairs and neglected to keep an eye on
tho minor organizations under its con
trol, but the newly elected board should
put an end to such slack management
and see that the courts are put in their
proper condition and kept so. Because
the weather has been bad is no excuse
for the condition of affairs. The courts
are crowded daily with players, even
though they are forced to splash
through water standing on the neg
lected courts, navigate tho muddy
background, or chase balls ou account of
the dilapidated condition of the back
nets.
