# Co-Op. Meeting.
## 
### 
At the meeting of the stockholders
of the Co operative Association today
there was a great deal of talking but no
business done. The purpose of the
meeting was to adopt by-laws, but the
objection was raised that, according to
the laws of California, two weeks no
tice of such meeting is required instead
of two days as in the present case. The
law also requires that by-laws be
adopted by a corporation within one
month after granting of its charter.
The proposed by-laws, however, areonly
to take the place of other by-laws that
were adopted at the proper time but
have been lost. In order to obviate the
difficulty of getting the necessary ma
jority of the 17U members together at
any one time it was moved that the
stockholders hand in written proxies
delegating to the Board of Directors the
power to adopt the by-laws. The mo
tion was lost, and the meeting ad
journed.
