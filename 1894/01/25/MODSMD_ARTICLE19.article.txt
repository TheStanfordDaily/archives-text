There are at present two student
reading rooms—at Encina and Roble —
both of which are dependent upon stu
deut support. A movement is ou foot
by the young ladies to give a concert
in the chapel for the benefit of the
Ruble reading room. A good plan
would be for the concert to be given
under the auspices and for the benefit
of both libraries. A greater attendance
would be secured, a more varied pro
gram could be presented, and both
reading rooms would be better off
financially.
