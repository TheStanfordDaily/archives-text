Dr Jordan read u evening
before the Geographical Society in San
Francisco upon the great St. Bernard
hospices in the Alps, the home of the
famous St. Bernard dogs lie de
scribed the little cold lake in the Alps,
on the edge of which were the hospices
of St Bernard. On all sides were
snow capped mountains, cold and rug
ged, indicating anything but life. The
buildings are of stone, plain and un
compromising
As one approaches the hospices of
the Great St. Bernatd he is met by a
legion of barking St Bernard dogs
ready to rescue him from the snow.
The dogs are yellow and white, and re
semble in some particulars those of th<;
same name found in large cities; but
they are not so large nor so well kept.
The ho-pice is entreed through triple
doors and within all are welcome.
There are pictures on the wall of the
main room, and a open tire at
which one may warm himself. All are
welcome fora day, and are supplied
with a plain and nourishing meal. The
next day all, whether princes or peas
ants, are asked to move on, unless they
are sick or otherwise disabled. Every
thing is free, but those who wish may
contribute any sum, large or small, to
be used for the entertainment of subse
quent wayfarers.
At the time l>r. Jordan visited the
hospice there were twenty monks there,
all young and vigorous men, for the
severity of the climate makes those liv
ing there become prematurely old.
There is snow the year round in the
pass wliere the hospices are situated,
and from November to May there is a
whirling gale, and the snow piles up in
billows.
