An innovation that would be appre
ciated by all, especially during the
winter months, would be a board walk
from the rear of Encina connecting
with the walk from the quad at the
co op. It would greatly decrease the
distance which has to be traversed by
students from Encina, Mayfield, and
College Terrace iu going to and from
the quadrangle, and would make the
two stores under the trees much more
convenient to the majority of their
patrons. The cost of such a walk
would not amount to very much and
its benefits would be inestimable.
