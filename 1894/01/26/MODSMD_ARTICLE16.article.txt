There are a few students in Encina
who are paving the way fora grand
denouement which, when it come 5 *, will
create a greater stir than the enthus
iasm of a dozen sophomore elections all
crowded into one. We refer to the
daily practice of removing papers and
magazines from the tables of the En
cina reading room to the private apart
ments of students. It would seem as if
a student who is old enough to have
entered college should have ceased
those p'tty pilferings that charac
terized his youthful career. Whoever
the guilty ones are let them take
warning.
