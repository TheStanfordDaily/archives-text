Judoino from the tactics of the var
ious athletic clubs at the amateur ath

letic convention held in San Francisco
last evening, it is very evident that pro
fessionalism will make its appearance
during the coming baseball and track
season if the officers of the association
uo not. keep a watchi'ul eye on the eu
tries from the athletic clubs
By voting down the proposed amend-1
ment to the constitution prohibiting
professionals from holding office in any j
club of the association, these organiza- !
tions have taken a stand which borders:
dangerously on professionalism Pro
fessionals should not he allowed to run
amateur athletics. By making ihcm
officers in any club this privilege is ac
corded them. The University of (Jal
itornia and Stanford University are the
only exponents of a truly amateur spirit,
and why should they bind themselves
to any such presumably well intended
and yet farcical constitution as the one
adopted last evejing at the Olympic
Club?
College athletics is the only truly
amateur s'port. The public at large
recognize this fully,and to enter into an
agreement half heartedly tiyw means a
rupture in the future. Let our Hoard
of Directors take notice, rather, of the
attempt now made by Berkeley to es
tablish an intercollegiate ugreemeut.
It must come sooner or later, and by a
little judicious action at present much
trouble will be avoided in the future.
