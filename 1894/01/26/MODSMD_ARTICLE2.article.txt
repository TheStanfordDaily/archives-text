### 
The Varsity baseball team will play
the second nine on the new diamond
tomorrow at 2:.'!0 o'clock. The grounds
will be prepared and rolled in the
morning, and a fast, hard game is as
sured These practice games deter
mine who is to play upon the Varsity,
and there >s much more competition
for every position this year than last.
Right field and first base are the weak
points in both nines; Captain Sheehan,
therefore, will alternate the candidates
for these positions until something
more definite is known of their play.
