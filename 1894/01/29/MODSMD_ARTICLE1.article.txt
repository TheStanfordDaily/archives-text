# The
						First Nine Defeated.
## 
### 
The Varsity baseball team was fairly
defeated by the second nine Saturday.
In the third and fourthj'inr.ings alone
the latter team scored eight times, and
their opponents were able to roll up but
four scatteted tallies in the whole game.
With men of the opposing side on bases
the second eleven played with a vim
which gave lew chances for scoring.
On the other hand, the Varsity men
seemed to be wanting at critical mom
ents when good work at the bat or in
the field was most necessary. The bat
ting of the second nine was the more
opportune. With three men on bases
White twice made a two-base hit, and
under the same circuinstancees Johnson
brought in two men by a single.
