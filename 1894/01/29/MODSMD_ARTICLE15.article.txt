The California .Midwinter Inter
national Exposition, or what will pro
bably be better known as the Fair, was
formally opened last Saturd iy afternoon
Over seventy thousand people were on
the grounds during the day. The
weather was such as is best calculated
to give the stranger to California the
best, impression of her climate
The Fair is a gigantic undertaking
for the comparatively small community
that has given its financial aid to the
enterprise. From present indications
the exhibits and even some of the build
ings will not be fully complete for at
least a month. Easter vacation will
find the Fair at its host, and at that
time a student can devote an entire
three days to a complete survey of the
whole exhibit.
