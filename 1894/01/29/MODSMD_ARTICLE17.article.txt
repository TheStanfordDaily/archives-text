An interesting phase of tramp life
was forcibly illustrated in Encina liall
the other day. A young man of worn
and ragged appearance, whose face was
the picture of Buffering and misery,
was seen wandering about the dormi
tory, exhibiting a frightfully ulcerated
arm. He told various stories of the
cause of his misfortune, and pitifully
expressed a desire to obtain sufficient
funds to enter one of the hospitals of
San Francisco for treatment. Many of
the students liberally contributed to the
"relief fund," and a neat little sum
was donated. It has since been learned
that this afflicted itinerant is an im
postor of the worst type.
One of the professors' wives, moved
by his pitiful story, graciously advanced
a sufficient turn to pay his fare to San
Francisco, and a student of the Uni
versity donated his fare to San .Juse.
These amounts, together with other
subscriptions, have probably furnished
the tramp with sufficient funds to enjoy
the privileges of the Midwinter Fair.
