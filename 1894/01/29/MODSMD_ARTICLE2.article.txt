# The 						Rev. Dr. Spalding's Sermon.
## 
### 
The services in the chapel Sunday
morning were of the Episcopalian order,
and were conducted by Dr. Spalding;,
who read the first lesson from the
thirty-fifth chapter of Jeremiah, the
second from the sixth chapter of Mat
thew. His text was taken from Gala
tians vi., 17: "From henceforth let
no man trouble me, for I bear in my
body the marks of the Lord Jesus."
Strange as it may seem, with all our
marvelous developement about us, our
standards of living are not as high as
they used to be. For one thing the
old sense of chivalry has passed away
and all human powers are fjiven up to
the getting of money. Sentiment is
more for principle than lor Yet
when this century is written up it will
be marked by the noblest kind of re

cords; by the lives of men who have
devoted themselves to the building up
of great ideals. This is a day of inves
tigation People are not going to ac
cept chivalry or any other custom be
cause it is old. There never was an
age in which men were so careful about
their ideals as they are at the present
time.
The words of my text were uttered
by a great man, whose life was noble
arid useful. St. Paul's career was
marked by these stroug characteristics,
self-denial, without which 1 believethere
is no such thing as life; self-respect,
and bravery. A citizen of the Roman
Empire by birth, he was sent to a
school at Jerusalem, where his piety
and great natural tri fts soon became ap
parent. lie gave up everything for his
Master; he even gave up his prejudices.
I find that the hardest things to give up
are the prejudices of birth and educa
tion.
In this he showed his marvelous self
denial; and his defiance of the mob,
besides many other events in his lite,
showed Ins inherent bravery. Yet the
world called his life a failure When
he wrote the words of the text he was a
man old in years, bent and wrinkled
with care. llis life reaches us that
there can be no such thing as liberty
in the sense of being free from law. A
man who disobeys the laws of nature is
so much less a true man. Now St.
Paul was free because he was a slave.
He was his master's property, and
nobody else had any right over him.
This is so today. We must all have
some m ster. The drunkard carries
out this law. Little by little his habit
winds its coi's about him until he be
comes its slave, and he is Iree from re
straint. He cares for no one else, for
no other person or power has control
over him. The drunkard is a slave,
but he is tree. We are all seeking our
masters. If I could leave my benedic
tion with you today I would say, Get
such a master as Saint Paul had, and
you will have the secret of a noble
life.
