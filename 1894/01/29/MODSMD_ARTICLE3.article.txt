# The
						Indian Mound at Castro.
## 
### 
The contents of the Castro mound
are proving quite valuable. Four more
skeletons were discovered last Saturday,
and two of these were removed. Shell
beads, shell eye-disks of ornamental ab
alone, and a bone implement, have also
been found.
The students in Pacific Slope History
have permission to excavate, and have
obtained instruments with which to do'
the work properly, it is hoped that all
who are interested in in the
mound will connect themselves with
the class, as scattered workers may lose
or pass by much that is of value.
Those who arc interested in the work
will meet Prof. Mary Burnes next
Thursday at 3 p.m. in room 24.
