## 
### 
Rose Hartwick Thorpe, author of the
famous poetn "Curfew Must Not Ring
Tonight," will appear in the chapel
Wednesday evening of this week, to
gether with E. Carson Thorpe, the
author and humorist. These two tal
ented auihors and reciters have just
completed a very successful tour of
southern California, and have been
induced to spend an evening at the
University. In commenting upon the
recital given at San Diego last week the
San Diegan says:
The supreme treat of the evening was
given in the recitation by Rose Hart
wick Thorpe of the story which has
made her fatuous throughout the world,
"Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight," and
the tribute of silence which respect
accords to genius was intensified by
tears from many eyes.
The admission fee will be fifty cents,
a very small sum considering the en
tertainment given and the personages
giving it. Seats will be reserved at
the registrar's office Tuesday afternoon
from 1:20 to '1 o'clock. No extra
charge for reserved seats. The pro
ceeds will be devoted to the stereopticon
fund
