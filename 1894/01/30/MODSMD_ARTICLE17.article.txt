There have been many questions
this semester as to the probability of a
farce being given this year as has been
done on previous years. It would not
be advisable to allow so pleasant a cus
tom to be forgotten. There is plenty
of talent in the student body to make a
very presentable entertainment, and un
doubtedly some very worthy object can
be found as an incentive to the players
of previous years, and to those whose
talent is not yet known. It is [already
time that some preparation was being
made for the event if those who are

able to take the initiative think ser
iously about it.
