# PROF. BARNES'S LECTURE.
## A 						Study on Children's Drawings. 
### 
[ suppose if a worthy old pedagogue
should come buck uow the most strik
ing thing he would see would be the
vast differentiation in our work. Form
erly the president of a university was al- I
ways listed as Prof. So-and-so, presi
dent in menta and moral science.
Twenty years ago we had not a single
department in experimental psychol
ogy. Today, we have in nearly every
great college and university special
courses in speculative psychology, and
not only th.it, but there is a society of
American Psych J >gy nearly every
member of which teaching in some
college. The field of study which lam
to present to you tonight was invented
less thau four years ago by Prof. Hall.
So long as a child is perfectly inac
tive he is useless for purposes of psy.
cholotrical study. Drawing is one way
in which a child conies out to meet the
world. Through a child's drawings we
can understand something of the way in
which he thinks and feels.
To collect a great number of draw
ings and to reduce them to a common
denominator, as it were, a little poem
was selected for illustration, and sent
t,'i public schools all over the country
The story was a translation from the
German, and was selected because it
was simple, short, and contained no dif
ficult pictures, and had two distinct
c itastrophes. Pictures illustrat ing the
story were sent in from 6,394 children,
tiuinly from California, and 15,218 dis
tinct scenes were drawn.
They were first collated to see what
parts of t ie story appealed most power
fully to the children. There were nine
wossible scenes that might be drawn:
Johnny going to school; approaching
the dog; falling over the dog; approach
ing the river; falling into the river;
tl tating on the river being rescued;
dripping on the back; going home
The returns showed three important,
scenes standing out above t!ie rest: (1)
Appr laching the dog. (2) The res
cue scene. (3) Approaching the river.
Presumably, other things being equal,
a child will draw those scenes which
most interest him; and if the passive
scenes, instead of the catastrophe, were
of more interest these two important in
ferences follow: that children care most
for that part of the story which leads
up to the climax; that the feeling of
mercy and helpfulness is much more
prominent than the desire to destroy.
The data were ..also colleetcd to show
the number of scenes drawn by differ
ent children at different ages. At six
they draw an average of one and six
tenths scenes Girls of thirteen and
boys of fourteen drew a little more than
three scenes each. This study shows
that children are less daring in express
ing themselves by drawing after pu
berty than before.

A third study was on Johnny as an
ideal. The child of two made a mere
scrawl, and promptly named it Johnny.
At first, as children progress, the lace
is drawn full, gradually changing to
profile, and then e3'es and nose are
tilled in as though it were a full lace.
12,740 faces were examined with a
view of determining the general law.
At six years twice as many full faces
were drawn as profiles At thirteen
the reverse was true. From this we
gather that at nine the child begins to
represent things as they really are.
The fact inostjjstrongly emphasized is
that pictures are, fora young child,
simply a language. He makes pictures
to convey an idea. The fact that his
drawings are diagramatic bears out this
idea. Sometimes a whole narrative is
told in a single picture. The following
conclusions would seem to be borne out
by the stud} of children's drawings:
1 Drawing is, for the young child, a
language, a uieans of expressing ideas.
2 Children naturally adopr, symbols
and conventional forms to express what
they want to say.
3. The courage to express ideas
through drawing increases until the age
of thirteen or lourteeu and then steadily
decreases.
4 The child thinks in small units.
5 Children like to draw large dis
tinct figures briefly expressed.
G. Children draw full faces until they
are nine, and after that, profiles.
7. In drawing figures they are most
interested in the head.
8 Color used only for decorative
effect. Strong • lack and white pre
ferred.
!> Children select the dramatic points
in a story well.
ID. They arc most attracted by scenes
just preceding catastrophes.
11. Their human instiuet is stronger
than their destructive
12. There is little difference between
the drawings made by buys and those
made by girls.
