The splendid American policy dis
played by Admiral Renhum in protect
ing the rights of our commerce in the
harbor of Rio de Janerio should heap
plaudcd hv all. It is a fact worthy of
note that an American admiral was the
first to pu r sue a policy now acknowl
edged by the leading European nations
as the right one. Our navy may not
he the greatest in the world but while
such men as Admiral Ben ham are in
command it will not lack the respect of
the other powers.
