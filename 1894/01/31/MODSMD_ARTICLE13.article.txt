No baseball captain was electrd for
the '95 class nine last night, on account
of those persons who were entitled to
vote not showing interest enough to put
in an appearance. This laek of inter
est should not, pervade the o'lier classes
which contemplate putting a team in the
field to contest lor the interclass cham
pionship. The board of directors will
soon be round with a subscription list or
some other means of raising money for
the support of baseball, and unless they
can point forward with certainty to an
interesting series of games on the cam
pus all attempts at money raising will
be futile.
