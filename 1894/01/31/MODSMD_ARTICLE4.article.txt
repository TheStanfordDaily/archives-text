### 
The February number of the Popu
lar Science Monthly contains a five
pane article by Ft of. iM. B. Anderson,
entitled: "Sketch of David Starr Jor
dan" and a frontispiece portrait of the
latter. The sketch is an able and in
teresting one. The following are some
extracts:
From his mother he seems to have
inherited his executive power, and from
his father his literary instinct. He
grew up a very unusual farm product—
a shy, observant lad, much given to
lonely excursions with a copy of Gray's
Botany in one pocket and Longfellow's
Poems in the other. . . . He came
to his studies, as a boy conies to a well
spread table, with a healthy appetite
A stranger to "cram," his mind assim
ilated its own, rejected what was not
food, and was n°ver converted from a
natural organ into a machine for gerund
grinding.
lie was probably the best man of his
time at college, yet he was rarely seen
to study, lie paid his expenses in one
way and another by his own labor, yet
be was a man of leisure Despite his
carelessness with respect to his per
sonal appearance and despite his whim
sical address, Ins spiritual qualities
marked hi 111 out as a man of fine breed
ing. . . .
As a teacher Jordan makes the i 111 -
ptession of weight, sincerity, and sim
plicity. He rests down confidently
upon the subject and makes that speak.
. . . Labors which break down ordin
ary men he takes as easily as a game of
baseball, in which he delights. Grind
ing disappointments seem to affect him
little more than does the defeat of the
faculty team by the freshmen. . . The
only thing that worries him is a full
dress dinner, with its dissipating ac
companiments of smoking, drinking,
and tpeech-making. He is so thoroughly
imbued with the conviction that a
straight line is the shortest distance be
tween two points that he is incapable of
the circuitous treatment of a subject es
sential to the after dinner speech.
