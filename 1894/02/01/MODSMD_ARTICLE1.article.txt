# Cotton the President of '94.
## 
### 
The Senior Class met this afternoon
in room 04, quadrangle, for the purpose
of electing officers for this their last
semester. As if conscience stricken by
the assertion in yesterday evening's
issue of their easy-going tendencies
they, like a slow contestant in a long
race, made a brilliant effort on the
home-stretch to gain applause from the
grand stand; they gained it.
The meeting was called to order at
1.30 by Miss Shelley, the president,
and it did not adjourn until 3 o'clock.
No other business than the election was
transacted, but that was carried on
amid the most evident excitement. The
flushed faces of the seven young lady
members of the class, the little whisper
ing groups of men, were watched
with interest by the crowd of other
class men that thronged outside the
windows. Motions to postone the
election, not to allow proxies, to ad
j iuru, were all voted down.
The first ballot resulted as follows:
For president, Keating 22, Cotton 22,
Critch'ow 1; for vice-president, Van
Denburgh (only nominee); for secretary,
Miss N Wood (only nominee); fortreas
urer, Geo. 11 Brown (only nominee);
lor historian, Hadley (only nominee);
for sergeant-at-arms, Wilson 13, Miss
llobz'daw 14, Monroe 3, Drake 5.
The result was greeted with great ap
plause followed by the departure of
several persons in search of other mem
bers of <he class who were known to be
hidden away in some laboratory and
whose votes would decide the election.
Five recruirs were obtained by this
means, and the class proceeded to a
second ballot, with the following result:
For president, Cotton 20, Keating 23,
Critchlow 1; for sergeant-at-arms Wil
son 17, Miss lloltzolaw If), Drake 1,
Monroe 3 As no candidate received
the required majority vote for sergeant
at-arms, on motion the secretary cast
the ballot for Miss Holtzclaw.
Cotton entered the University as a
freshman with the Class of '95, but by
diligent work has secured enough credit
to obtain his A. B. with the class of
which he is now president. In thank
ing the class for the honor they had
conferred upon him he said that he
hoped today's enthusiasm wutild be only
the beginning of a rcanimation in the
class and that it would lead to some
thing which would vary the unevent
ful record of former commencements.
