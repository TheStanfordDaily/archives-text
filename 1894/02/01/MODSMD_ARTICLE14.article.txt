There is an unusual hum unt of com
plaint at present in Kncina about the
lack of heat. Students living on the
upper floors, and especially upon the
north side, receive no heat at all dur
ing the daytime. It should be remem
bered that it is not always warm when
the sun is shining, and that in a great
building like the young men's dormi
tory the shady side must have plenty <j|
artificial heat to render it comfortable.
The present condition of the students
in the hall reminds one of a prevailing
epidemic of la grippe. Nearly every
one has and in consequence not
a few are threatening to move where
more hospitable accomodations may be
secured.
