The new plan fur the prevention of
cheating iu examinations, to be tried in
tne economics department tomorrow,
should commend itself to everys udent.
The effect will he to place a premium
upon honesty instead, as in the past, of
having a premium upon dishonesty. 'I he
student who never cheats will not be
affected by the plan; the one who has
cheated will be compelled to turn over
a new leaf, or better .-till, sever his con
nection with the University. To cheat
in an examination is to tell an egregious
lie; and to lie with the expedition of
profiting thereby, even if it is only to
the extent of two hours' credit, is a
crime which merits the condemnation
of everyone, though committed by one's
best friend.
