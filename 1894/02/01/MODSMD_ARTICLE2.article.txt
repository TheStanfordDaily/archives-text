# "The Stanford Quad."

The cost of producing "The Stanford
Quad," the principal work on which
will lie done by the 11. S. Crocker Co.,
of San Francisco, will be 112? 1750. This
sum covers the publication of Sf)o
copies. From this fact it c;m be seen
that the 'I*s annual will costa little
over two dollars per copy, though it will
probably be sold at one dollar per copy.

The business manager, N. G. Buxton,
asserts that fully seventy-five pages of
advtrtiscments at $20 per page are
necessary to the successful issue of the
annual, for there are other expenses in
addition to those of publication and
artistic work, It will be necessary to
allow assistant business managers a cer
tain commission on the advertisements
they secure; so fully ยง2,000 must be
counted on for resources. So far but
twenty pages of a'ivertisemeuts have
been secured and considerably more en
couragment in the way of prospective
returns must be forthcoming to the pub
lishers beforo the publication can be
undertaken.
Last year the class of '94 at the Un
iversity of California found it necessary
to levy an assessment, it is said, of 814
per capita upon members of the class in
order to emerge successful'y from their
undertaking. The class of '95 at the
same institution has just levied, it
seems, au assessment of ยง5 per capita
for the same purpose. It is customary
to charge fraternities and similar organ
izations a sum in the neighborhood of
from ten to twenty dollars for repre
sentation in the annual. This source
alone will yield from 6150 to 8200.
The editors <>l The Stanford Q tad are
seriously considering the advisibility of
asking the Class of '95 for an assess
ment, of 82 per capita to obtain ready
money for publication purposes. The
probabilities are that the amount thus
secured wou'd be taken as a loan if the
ultimate resources warrant a return of
the amount advanced by the class.
