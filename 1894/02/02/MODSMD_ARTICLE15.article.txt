The laws of California c in hardly he
said to favor educational institutions
Under the state law this University is
taxed heavily for the benefit of a school
fund upon which it has no claim. T
acics to this institution arc taxed live
per cent., also for the benefit of the
school fund. When it is remembered
that nearly one thousand students re
ceive free tuition here, and that in
eastern states where educational institu
tions are exempt, from taxation the item
of tuition alone generally represents
from 5125 to $150 per annum per stu

dent, the injustice of the California sys
tem of taxing all educational institutions
is manifest.
