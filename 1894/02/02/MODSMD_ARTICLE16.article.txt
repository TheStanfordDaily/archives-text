If any one fails to see why Lei n<J
Stanford Junior University is so for
tunate as to be able to issue a first-clacs
daily in addition to oilier papers let h in
glance over the advertising columns of
the Palo Alto and the mystery is un
raveled. The business men who live
near the University evidently believe in
supporting a good thing, for in the
columns of that paper arc found - 'ads"
of ranchmen, lumber deders, hotel men,
flour, feed, and fuel dealers, in addition
to those of merchants who deal in stu
dents' regular supplies. It is enterprise
of this kind that "makes things go" at
any instilution. Doubtless the students
support their oaper as well as the mer
chants with whom the students trade
Under these conditions there is some
encouragement for an editor to work,
and as a result the Stanfi rd papers are
a credit to the institution and one of
the best advertisements it has. â€” Indiana
Student.
