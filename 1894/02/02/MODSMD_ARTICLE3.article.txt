'I he practice baseball game yesterday
afternoon was another walk-over for the
second nine. Thompson pitched three
innings for the Varsity team, and be
sides being wild was given verv poor
support; errors of play and of judgment
came at those times when most produc
five of runs. McLaine pitched the last
inning but was ineffective on account of
a lame arm. Weldon's good work in
the box for the second nine was the
main factor in the defeat of the Varsity.
