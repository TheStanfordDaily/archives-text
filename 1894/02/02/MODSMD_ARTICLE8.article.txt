Jordan, Prof. Marx, Mr. I lodges, and
Mr. Moore, visited the dam of the
Spring Valley Company this afternoon.
Mr. Howard's visit portends a plentiful
supply of pure w iter for the University

It has been the opinion of some that
the company has not fulfilled its agree
ment with Senator Stanford in regard
to our water privileges; but we are in
formed by Mr llodges that this is not
true, and that Mr. Howard is doing
everything possible to improve our
supply.
Mr. Hodges requests that all tenants
on the campus allow the water in their
houses to run whenever it is convenient
in order to cleanse the pipes after the
heavy raius.
