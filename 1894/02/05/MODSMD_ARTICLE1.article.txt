# The
						Varsity Nine Played Ball.
## 
### 
The Varsity team defeated the sec
ond nine in the regular Saturday prac
tice game on the oval. The two prev
ious victories by their opponents put
them on their mettle and every man
played his best. MeLaine pitched an
excellent game and was well supported.
Several players were absent and the
second nine was weakened in conse
quence. The men were also changed
about, destroying the team work which
has been so pleasing a feature of the
second nine's play. The Varsity team
should consider itself fortunate in hav
ing such opponents. Care, however,
should be taken to secure an umpire
thoroughly versed in the line points of
the game. Without good umpiring it
is impossible to judge accurately of a
player's ability. The score:
