Editor Daily Palo Alto:â€”There
are certain organizations at Stanford
instituted by students, whose sense of
obligation to creditors has fallen far be
low the dignity worthy of college men
I refer more particularly to the Stan
ford Boat Club. Why do not the mem
bers of this organization co operate
with its officers to reciprocate the kind
ness of the firms who have generously
given substantial support to our stu
dent enterprises? It cannot be but ex
tremely detrimental to the whole stu
dent body to have any student organiza
tion, whatever its character, show such
indifference to irs obligations.
To exonerate ourselves on the plea of
hard times is doing an injustice to our
creditors, who are compelled to sustain
their honor, let the inconveniences be
what they may. If the Stanford Boat
Club is to die let us give it an honor
able burial. Let us not send it to its
grave in a coffin of mortgaged lumber,
and an unpaid hotel bill for an epitaph.
