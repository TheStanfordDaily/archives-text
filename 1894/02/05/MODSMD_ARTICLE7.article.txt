### 
For David, after he had served bis own
generation by the will of (iod, fell on
sleep and was laid unto his fathers,
and saw corruption.
Sometimes it is the few little grace
notes which are added simply by waj
of embellishment to a piece of music
which remain longest in our memory.
Sometimes it is the side remark that
we remember longer than the main
topic of conversation.
Now, Paul was endeavoring to prove
to his audience that Jesus of Nazareth
was the Messiah. He hid occasion to
refer to David in the terms of our text.
The words that, are in this passing re
mark are full oi significance and very
weighty in power.
Most men and women have sonit
ideal in life to be realized We all
have some general conception of the
purpose, meaning, and duty of life.
The ideal suggested in this text seems
to incarnate all the ends which enlarge
ourselves.
With many, the ideal seems to cen
tre in the pursuit of wealth as a means
of personal gratification To attain
social position and political honor —
things which terminate with ourselves
—sway great multitudes. But the
voice of God speaks in a higher key.
It urges us on iuto the higher atmos
phere of endeavor.
David served his own generation.
Scrvice is the true end of life, is what
this text means. In the voyage of life
there are obstacles in the way, and it is
necessary that strong hands be at the
oars. If we are not to stand where our
forefathers stood we must advance, aud
to make progress we must toil. It is a
beautiful thought when we realize it,
that the true purpose of lile is to be of
assistance one to another.
Everyone who allows his oar to dangle
uselessly in the water retards not only
his owu progress but that of many
others. David served not, only his own
generation but all succeeding genera
tions. So we, if we are to accomplish
this real end of life, must have in mind
our own generation. The work we do
now is the work we can in a measure
control. It will not do to try to serve
our own generation with the implements
of a former age. Professional men
must be conversant in the latest lore of
their vocations or they will not succeed.
We are serving our own age by the
will of God. The Almighty has a
certain control over all our lives. There
arc providential adjustments in the
course of our lives over which we have
no control, and by which He can bring
about good in the end. There are three
ways in which we may perform this
great service of life: By adjusting our
selves to the providential arrangements
of God; by going on blindly following
our own will; and by the direct influ
ence of the Almighty upon our lives.
