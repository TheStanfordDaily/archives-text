The Class ol '95 met this afternoon
under the '95 oak to have a picture
taken lor "The Stanford Quad " Only
one hundred and fifteen members were
present, while one hundred and forty
attended the l-ist meeting of the class.
If a proper representation of the mem
bership and strength of the class is to
appear in the picture it w -uld seem
that the result of this afternoon's meet
ing is not satisfactory.
With the prospect of assessments for
the junior hop, and the annual, it
wou'd not be amiss for the class council
and the class secretary to ascertain from
all possible sources the exact member
ship of the class, so that if it becomes
necessary to know whom to approach to
represent the class in a picture or whom
to collect assessments from no one will
be overlooked.
