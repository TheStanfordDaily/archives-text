OwiNO to tin jealousy of some stu
dents who dislike to see a uiuu who
cheats get as high a mark on an ex
amination paper as themselves, a proposal
has been made to certain classes in the
University to sign a statement to the
effect that help has neither been given
nor received in the examination. This
means the introduction of a system lure
that makes the honorable feel suspected.
A student with atiy sense of honor
would feel ashamed to make a state
ment, in support of his integrity. To
be requested to do so is demoralizing.
Not only tliis, but, no good can come
from the introduction of such a scheme.
What does it matter to the crowd of
hard students here if some do get
through with credit by dishonorable
means? They know well enough that
those who scheme an examination are
wholly the losers and that by their con
tinuing to do so the struggle for ex
istence will be somewhat reduced, much
to the advantage of all.

It is unquestionable that a man who
will cheat will lie and so defeat the ob
ject of the plan. The motive for cheat
ini; is the fear of failure in examination.
Let a stronger motive be introduced
such as the fear of expulsion for cheat
ing and the vice will soon be removed.
This last remedy appears to be the most
desirable, since it removes finally a
class of students who are doing them
selves little good and permanently de
moralizing others. By no means
should the honorable student be re
quested to forego his self respect for the
sake of worthless fellows who could not
be kept from cheating by any motive
but the fear of consequences greater
than those incurred by failure in ex
animations.
