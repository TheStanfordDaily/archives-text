The following letter was received by
Piesident Jordan over the intercolleg
iate debate:
San Francisco, Jan. 25, 1894.
President Jordan, Stanford Univ.
Dear Sir: â€”The Executive Com
mittee ot the International Exposition
has set aside May 10th as an inter-col
legiate day, the principal feature of
wnich is to be a debate between the
U. C. and Leland Stanford Junior
University.
They offer to the debating societies
the free use of their festival hall, which
will accommodate over 8,000 people, to
gether with the illumination, etc ; be
sides, thev will present the successful
college with an elegant trophy. The
mere opportunity ol debating at an In
ternational Exposition would in itself
fire the students to bring their Univer
sity to the front, but as a reward for
their time and study the committee of
fers them a silver cup. As the inter
collegiate debate usually takes place at
that time it is hoped that the 10th of
May will be convenient to your college.
Kindly let me know the addresses
of responsible students of your debat
ing societies with whom 1 may communi
cate that arrangements can be made.
Yours respectfully,
Leon. E. Prksco'it.
