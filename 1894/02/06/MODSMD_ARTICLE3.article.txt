# The
						"Examiner" Will Offer $100 for an Oratorical Contest.
## 
### 
At the opening of the semester a
committee was appointed by Mr. Schur
ter to endeavor to bring about an ora
torical contest between the 11. C. and
Stanford The San Francisco Exami
ner at first agreed to give a $25 gold
medal to the winner, if such a contest
could be arranged. This committee
interviewed several U. (J. students
as to the likelihood of acceptance,
should Stanford issue a challenge.
The idea met with little favor
Even Stan ford men showed no special

enthusiasm in the matter. A member
of the committee saw Mr. W. 11.
Hearst, editor of the Examiner, last
Saturday and stated that an offer of a
825 gold medal would not likely at
tract sufficient attention from students
of either university to ijive the time
and preparation required; whereupon
Mr. Hearst said he would make the of
fer $100 in gold, leaving all details and
arrangements to be decided by a joint
committee of six, three from each uni
versity. A committee of three will
probably be appointed at the next
meeting of the Associated Students to
challenge Berkeley upon the publica
tion of the Examiner's offer in its own
columns, and to make all arrangements
according to the conditions named by
the Examiner.
