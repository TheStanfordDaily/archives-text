# "The Stanford Quad" Prizes.
## 
### 
The judges selected by the editorial
board of the annual to pass upon the
short stories submitted for the prize
have decided in favor of a story by
Miss Winifred Harper, '90, entitled
"Why it was a tie." This story was
awarded the first prize. "A Stanford
Circumstance" by W P. Chamherlin,
'515, was a very close Hecond, and was
recommended for the second prize. All
the stories in the competition were very
favorably criticised. The judges were
Professors Hudson, Woodruff, and
Lathrop.
The committee who acted as judges
upon the designs decided in favor of
the design submitted by Roy D. Ely,
'95, and spoke very highly of his work.
Many other designs were received
which, while creditable as artistic pro
ductions, were much less suitable and
appropriate than the one chosen. The
judges were Professors lirown and
Smith and Miss Atnes.
