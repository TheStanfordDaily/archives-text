B. S. Pague's Lecture.
Mr. Pague is at the head of the
Pacific slope weather forecast bureau
situated at San Francisco. His lecture,
a synopsis of which is here given, ex
plained the science by which the next
day's weather is forecasted, not only for
this coast but for the whole United
States.
Meteorology of today consists first of
the theory and education, and second,
the practical applications, from which
we have the weather forecasts.
There prevails an erroneous impres
sion that the daily weather forecast
should be absolutely true. The word
"forecast" should be interpreted to mean
that the conditions at present indicate
that the weather at a certain time in
the near future will bo of such and
such a character. W eather forecasting
is practical meteorology. It is the
study of natural .laws and recurring
conditions with the applicatinn of the
results.
The public are becoming more
dependent upon the local forecast re
ports. The more familiar we are with
the increase and decrease of the local
temperature the more accurate will be
our reported indications. It is only
through the medium of the weather
bureau that we have the knowledge of
the climate of our own and mauy other
states.
This bureau is a branch of work di
rected to afford the greatest good to the
greatest number. It is attracting more
attention today than ever before. Col
leges and universities arti including it
in their courses of study,
Meteorology is essentially tin applica
tion of hydro- and thermo-dynamics. It
teaches the constitution and weight of
the air; the velocity and direction of the
winds; the precipitation of vapor, frost,
snow, rain, and hail. It has been the
subject of investigation for many ages;
traces of it are seen in the Bible and in
Shakspere. But the recent science
could only begin with the development
of the study of physical geography and
natural science.
The air or atmosphere surrounding
the earth is composed, in the main, of
oxygen and nitrogen, with a small
amount of carbonic dioxide, the average
proportions being, by volume: Oxygen
20.00, nitrogen 79, carbonic dioxide .04.
Air containing only oxygen and nitro
gen is said to be pure and dry.
The proportion of carbonic dioxide is
greater in cities than in the country.
Air also contains, at all times, minute
<|uantitus of water. Animals consume
the oxygen, while plants consume the
carbonic dioxide.
Ozone, which may be produced by
electrolysis of water, was discovered in
1840. On account of its disinfecting
properties thunderstorms, which pro

(luce it, are thought to be great puri
fiers of the air. Immediately after
such a storm the amount of ozone in
the air is four times greater than be
fore. Upon the principle of the weight
und elasticity of the air the barometer
was iuvented, and of the different forms
of this instrument the mercurial is the
most eminent and is the one in official
use. Temperature varies more over
vast land areas than it does over equal
areas on the ocean. The first baromet
rical observations were made in this
country in 1838 in South Carolina. In
1742 regular observations were begun
in Boston. Jefferson and Madison took
observations simultaneously in different
parts of the country for several years,
about 1782. A little after 1822 the
meteorological system now in use was es
tablished.
A knowledge of the motions of the
atmosphere is an essential element in
all investigation in meteorology. There
are two currents of air, the upper and
the lower. The motion and velocity of
the upper currents are generally very
different from those of the 1 iwer. The
motions and directions of the winds are
generally determined by the condition
of the lower atmosphere. The sun and
moon do not cause tides in the atmos
phere as they do in the waters of the
globe.
It hardly seems possible to make
weather forecasts for four or five months
in advance. Yet upon the standards of
past records we make forecasts fora
month ahead, and with a reasonable
amount of certainty.
At the different stations throughout
the country simultaneous observations
are taken at 8a m.and 5p m. Within
one hour these reports are all in at the
central office at Washington. At San
Francisco we receive reports from
Chicago west and from Texas north.
These are recorded, compared, and from
the charts and lines thus made out the
storm center is soon found and the
weather forecast made out. Rut the
work has to be done quickly, for the
telegraph operators are waiting.
Meteorology is yet in its infancy.
There are many investigations and in
ventions yet to be made and many
questions yet to be answered. When
they are solved weather forecasting will
advance to a more practical good.
