# Assessment for the Annual.
## 
### 
At the meeting of the '95 council
last evening in En'iina it was decided
to levy an assessment of *two dollars
upon ouch member of the class in order
to meet the expenses of the annual.
This assessment was deemed neces
sary by the council after bearing the
report, of the editor of the annual, and
was unanimously voted for. It is the
intention, however, to secure the sum
merely as a loan if possible. If there
be a surplus when the expenses of the

annual are paid all of the assessment
or a percentage of it will be refunded.
The amount will be collected in two
payments, one dollar this month aud
one dollar in March. The class treas
urer assisted by Stuart, Bea, and Soper,
assistant business managers of The
Stanford Quad, will collect the assess
ment.
