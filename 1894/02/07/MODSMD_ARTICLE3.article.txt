Editor Daily Palo Alto:
There are many students besides my
self who would like to know precisely
the conditions for membership in the
several college classes. There are, no
doubt, quite a number of students who
will take their degree at the close of
the first semester. To what class, if
any, do they belong? Hy quoting the
article on membership of the several
classes you can greatly oblige
Many Students.
Class of'04. —Any member of the
University who has to his credit fifteen
hours more than, or fifteen hours less
than, the number required to make him
an unconditioned member of the (Mass
of '94 may become a member upon
signing the constitution.
Class of '95 —This organization shall
be composed of all regularly registered
members of the (Mass of '95.
Class of '96 —The members of this
class shall comprise all students of the
Leland Stanford .Junior University who
have less than thirty hours' credit for
the year '92-'93; more than thirty, and
less than sixty hours' credit for the
year '93—'04; more than sixty and less
than ninety hours' credit for the year
'94—'95; more than ninety hours' credit
lor the year '95-'96.
Class of '97. —This organization shall
be composed of regularly registered
members of the Class of '97 and all
regularly registered special students
who are in sympathy with,and desire to
affiliate with, this class.
The above extracts are from the sev
eral class constitutions. The University
recogniz-s no classes. Whenever a
student has one hundred and twenty
hours of University work to his credit,
and has been recommended by the pro
fessor in charge of his major subject, he
receives his degree, be it one or ten
semesters after he has first registered
in the University, .As to what class
those belong who receive their decrees
at the end of the first semester we can
not say. Generally speaking, a stu
dent belongs to that class with which
he hopes to graduate, and to which his
sympathies and his conscience prompt,
him to be loyal.—Editor.
