A UNIQUE plan has been proposed
by a member of the faculty in regard
to the stereoptieon lurid. It is to have
a spelling match in the chapel between
any two organizations on the campus.
Let the young ladies of Roble spell
against the inmates of Kncina, or Ku
phronia against Alpha. A small admis
sion fee could be charged. No time
would be required by the contestants
fnr preparation, and we venture t'> assert
that nearly every student of the Uni
versity would be out to see the fun and
Contribute towards the purchase of the
stereoptieon.
