Our general assembly accommoda
tions are su limited and most of our
popular lectures are so well attended,
that to see from fifty to two hundred
persons, many of whom are ladies,
standing during a whole hour's enter
tain merit is very common. Many times
there are seats in the middle of a row
which are undiscoverable and inaccessi
ble to thofe who come in late. It the
first ones to enter a row of seats would
scat themselves in the middle instead of
monopolizing the outside chairs they
would confer a jrreat favor on the stu
dent body, on the patrons of the chapel,
and on many who would rather stand
than undergo the embarrassment con
s« <j'!•'111 upon squeezing past a long
line of p< ople in order to obtain a seat.
