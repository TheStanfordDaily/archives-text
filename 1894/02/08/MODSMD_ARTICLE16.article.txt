The lengthy diseusidous of the Ex
ecutive Committee of tlic Associated
Students have raised the question uf
the propriety of adowing in future the
different managers of Hthletic teams ;i
certain percentage of the surplus saved
to the Associated Students through the

skill of the athletic managers. Hereto
fore the several managers have received
no remuneration for their services
other than their traveling expeuses
There has been no incentive to
leave money in the treasury. On the
other hand the desire to treat their re
spective teams generously and unstint
ingly has been a great factor in prompt
ing the managers to he too liberal.
Football w'.th all its great resources
has never yet yielded a sum in oxces*
of the athletic expenses Uaseball has
been a dead loss financially. Track
athletics and tennis have also been pen
sioners depeudent upon the athletic
fund.
Hy judicious and careful manage
ment football shouid yield a sum an
nually which would be sufficient for all
athletic purposes. To insure a surplus
some material inducement mignt be of
fered to the football manager hy allow
ing him stated percentages for stated
surpluses. It might he well to give the
other athletic managers all t.hey could
save after paying all the expenses of
their respective departments.
We submit these rambling and hur
ried remarks for the consideration of
the student body, not as the most prac
tical means of deciding our financial
difficulty, but in order to create a more
general interest in, and discussion of,
matters tliat must soon be decided.
