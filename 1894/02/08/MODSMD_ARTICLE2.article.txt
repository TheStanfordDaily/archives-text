# A 						New Constitution For the Associated Students.
## 
### 
The Executive Committee of the
student body held a long meeting yes
terday evening and nearly completed a
new constitution which will soon be
submitted to the Associated Students
as a more complete and practicable con
stitution than the one by which that
organization is now governed. Many
radical changes are proposed, particu
larly in the government of athletic
and financial affairs The committee
which has been working on this con
stitution for some little time, will meet
again tomorrow evening, when it is
hoped that their present work may he
completed and ready to submit to the
student body for that general discussion
which its conteuts and importance
merit.
In substance some of the changes
proposed are that the aunual election of
officers be held in April instead of
in September; that the treasurer of the
Associated Students be such in fact as
well as in name, and have charge of all
money collccred by the various teams;
that all regular elections be by ballot at
the polls; and that regular nominations
are not prerequisites to election. The
vacancy existing in the board by reason
of the election, last September, of only
one instead of two representatives from
the Class of '07, was filled by the board.
Sam Piatt was unanimously elected.
The board is now composed of /ion,
president of the Associated Students,
Oritchlow and Trumbo from '04, Cox
and Kice from '05, liledsoe and Spald
ing from '00, Thomas and Piatt from
'07.
