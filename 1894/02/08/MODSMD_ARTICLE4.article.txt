# The
						Astronomy of Today.

The lecture before the class in Pop
ular Astronomy this morning was given
by Prof. W YV. Campbell of the Lick
Observatory, on the astronomical inves
tigations conducted at the observatory
during the past few years and the lines
of investigation to be pursued in the
near future.
The spectroscope is the main factor
in the advance of the science ciuring
the past thirty-five years. At present
results are obtained from it which were
not even thought of some few years
ago. By its use we have been enabled
to determine not only the chemical con
stitution of heavenly bodies, but also
whether they are approaching the earth
or receding from it. In this direction
the Lick Observatory is now preparing
to investigate the motion of the solar
system through space. The work will
include the use of the big telescope
half of the time during the next three
or four years. At the end of that time
it is hoped to have accurately deter
mined the rate of motion and also the
direction.
The use of the spectroscope in inves
tigating the composition of the nebulae
in the constellation Orion has given
results which have greatly helped the
study of the evolution of heavenly
bodies.
In 1802 Profs. Catnphell and Hussey
made observations on the prominences
of Mars. These prominences were at
first supposed to be mountains, but later
discussion put some doubt on the result.
Further observations will be made next
October, and it. is expected they will
not only settle that point but also give
us the means of interpreting the dark
and light spots on the surface of the
planet.
