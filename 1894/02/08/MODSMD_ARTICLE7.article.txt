# That Unsent Challenge.

The following article appeared in
Wednesday's ('hronic/e from the pen of
its Berkeley correspondent:
Considerable feeling is manifested
by the students over the manner in
which certain students at Stanford have
acted in regard to the intercollegiate
debate. Some time ago some students
from Stanford went to a newspaper pro
prietor aod asked if his paper would
give a medal for an intercollegiate de
bate. Receiving an affirmative answer
the students returned to their college.
Immediately there appeared in one of
the Stanford college journals, an item
which stated it was a challenge' to the
htate University to an intercollegiate
debate. No challenge was sent to the
University of California, and even had the
students there seen as a body such a
challenge, they say they could not., out
of respect to themselves, have consid
ered it, coming in such a manner. A
few days later the medal emmissaries
went again to the proprietor of the
paper offering the medal, it is said, and
stated that the State University refused
to accept the challenge and requested
him to offer a medal to the winning
side of a debate between Stanford
speakers alone. That request was de
uied.
In referring to this matter yesterday
a Berkeley student said: "That such an
action by students of any university
must have go'-e unauthorized may be
taken for granted, but the students of
theState University feel that the Stan
ford student body is culp ble in not dis
avowing its connection with the action
of these students "
As has been surmised by the writer
of the above, the student body at this
University had no cognizance of any
such action being taken in regard to an
intercollegiate debate. The entire af
fair has been in the hands of private
parties and it was through their efforts
that the Exuminer made its liberal of
fer. If the Berkeley student body
failed to receive a challenge it was
through the neglect of the persons who
have been working the matter up
These persons could not have sent an
official challenge for the University.
The matter is to be laid before the
Associated Students at their next meet
ing.
The writer is mistaken as to the
character of the contest. An intercol
legiate oratorical contest, not a debate
was contemplated. He is also mis
taken in regard to any intimation
being made that the prize should
be offered for any but an inter
collegiate contest. His mistaken and
unfounded statements should not be
credited to a generil spiteful feeling on
the part of the student body at Berk
eley, any more than the unfortunate
but unintentional discourtesy of a few at
this University should be attributed to
a general malicious feeling on the part
of our student body for the students of
the State University.
