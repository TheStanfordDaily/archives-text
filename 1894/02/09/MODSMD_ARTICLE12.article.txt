The suggestion that a room in the
quadrangle be set apart fora reading
room of current literature is a good one.
In it could be placed notonly the college
exchanges, including the city dailies,
but the magazines now filed in the li
brary. The present library reading
room would thus be relieved of its
troublesome loose periodicals, and could
be entirely devoted to the purpose for
which it was intended, that of a refer
ence and study room.
It is conceded that the present sys
tem of disposing of magazines in the
library is not a success. It is impos
sible to secure a periodical in the li
brary without a great deal of trouble,
and the last numbers are generally mis
sing from the file when found. With the
present accommodations often no seats
can be obtained and many have to
stand. One way out, of the difficulty
would be to fit up another reading-room,
and the divisiou might be made better
on the line suggested than on any other.
