Certain Stanford students, who read J
yet understand not. say tlie Oreyoiti<tn !
"would have it believed that mtellec
tual development is of seconduiy im
portance" at their university. Their
failure to discern and enjoy good-tem
pered irony warrants the conclusion
they combat. If "nowhere is intellect,
given a higher rank" than at Stanford
they may well dread the coming of
examinations. The suggestion is thrown
out that one of the university's high
salaried language professors makes the)
Oregon inn's enjoyable skit on the Mult-|
nomah-Stanford game the subject of a J
lecture to the students on the uses of
sarcasm, in the hope that it will
aid the development so much
desired there. As to football, ''they're
all right"; as to Knglish, a trifle crude.
