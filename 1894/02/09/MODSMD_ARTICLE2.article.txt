# Miss Addams's Address.
## 
### 
Il was more of an informal talk than
a lecture to which a crowded chapel
listened last night. Whatever antici
pation may have pictured to the audit
ors they were all most agreeably pleased
and surprised with the charming voice
and tuanuer of the young woman who
spoke so interestingly of the improve
ments which are being made in the
worst section of Chicago, a work in
which she has taken a prominent part.
A synopsis of the lecture is given be
low.
Whenever T speak of Hull House I
like to connect with it the name of
Arnold Toynbee, who loved to spend
his vacations in the lower haunts of
London. He came hack with marvel
ous tales of those regions, lie some
times went without money, prefering to
work among them, and always found
them ready to help him out. He
thought that in so jie respacts that east
reifion of London contained a greater
self sacrificing element than Oxford and
other places in which he had lived.
Many of his friends went with him
down there to find out what those peo
ple were like. When Toynbte Hall
was afterwards established in London in
September, 1883, it was found that one
end of society hud something which the
other end needs.
Hull House in Chicago was founded
four years ago next September. I am
very anxious that the young people of
America should not get the idea that
this settlement is an unnatural thing.
It is quite different. We find it be
coming more natural to us every day.
The part of the city near the corner
of Polk and Hostages street has most ly a
foreign population. In this district
there are a irreut many Italians. We
began with an Italian receptiou. And
it was marvelous to see how they re
sponded. They were very curious to
know why an American wast king an
interest in them. They seldom saw
Americans except at election time. For
eigners, as a rule, dislike us because
fhey think all we want is money. We
found many educated Italians ready to
help us when once we had a place in
which they could focus their efforts.
The Italian district in Chicago reminds

one of the original native Italian villages.
We did much the same thing with
other foreigners. We had evenings for
the Germans and found them to have
certain graces and charms which they
displayed only among themselves. We
must expect all these different for
eigners to bring in some characteristics
of their own countries and blend them
with our life.
We started a little reading room for
the Greeks, who, by the way, are fast
running out the fruit vendors. It was
our desire to make the unattractive
parts of the city attractive. We had
pictures for people who did not care
for pictures. We had educational de
partments also. Strong efforts are be
ing made to form a grand chorus amoug
the working people And we have an
educational class numbering nearly two
hundred and fifty.
| The speaker here referred to the
politics of the 19th ward, and ex
pressed a desire not be quoted.]
When we first settled we made a
strong effort fora public library, for
there was no branch station in this part
of the city. A library was finally es
tablished for us and soon ranked second
in atteudar.ee. We also «r<»t a sohool
house for the ward. The working
people are not surprised it' you are kind
to their children; hut they are surprised
at kindnesses to themselves
We are very near sncalistic and an
tarchistic clubs, and we often go to listea
o them discuss questions in their one" 1
sided way. In their meetings the work
ing men speak very plainly, firmly, and
fearlesslv. We have been mure or less
identified with the labor movement.
We find that among the sewing trades
the union is doing very poorly. The
shirt and cloak makers have organized;
but as they have no place to meet they
often have great trouble with organiza
tion. This is the same trouble strikers
have We have tried to arbitrate strikes.
In some cases we have been successful,
but generally quite otherwise.
We have about fifty children brought
to us every day by their mothers, who
are generally poor Russian Jewesses
that have been deserted by their hus
bands They are almost helpless, for
they cannot bear heavy work; all the}
do s to peddle a stupendous amount of
suspenders.
The hulk of our work is perhaps
among the better classes. We have a
large women's club composed of the
most reputable women in the neighbor
hood. This club has been very active
in establishing a good many things.
We have had coffee sent to men in fac
tories, and coffee houses established to
counteract the saloon.
Tn them iin the residents in Hull
House a r e entirely men and women. I
believe there are eighteen in all. A
great deal of work is done by people
living outside the house.
The poor people of a great city are
very closely hemmed in. They do not.
know of the wonderful things beyond
them. They are shut out year afier
year from the great world, and it is a
pleasure to receive them. 1 truly be
lieve that our next great orator is to be
a workin<2man.
