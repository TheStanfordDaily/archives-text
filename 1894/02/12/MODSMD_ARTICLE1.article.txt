The baseball conference to which
Captain Sheehan and Manager Cox
were delegates was attended by he rep
resentatives from ten different colleges.
Arrangements were virtually completed
for the formal ion of a league composed
of four or five institutions: St. Ignatius,
St. Mary's, and Santa Clara Colleges,
Stanford and the U. C. (if the latter
will decide to enter by uext Saturday
night, wheu a final meeting will be
held). Stanford will probably play
eight games in all, begiuning Feb. 22.
The actual expenses of all the teams
will be paid and passes into the Fair
grounds issued to them on dajs of
games. Admission will be charged
only to the grand-stand, which has a
seating capacity of seven thousand.
This league will be a great benefit to
baseball on the coast, besides conferr
ing many privileges on the players.
