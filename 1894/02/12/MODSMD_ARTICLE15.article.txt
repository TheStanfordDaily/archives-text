The lecture tomorrow evening by
C. W. Reed will be well worth the at
tention of all interested in municipal
government. Mr. Reed is a prominent
young lawyer and politician of San
Francisco and has been instrumental in
bringing about many beneficial reforms
in the city's politics. He is also one
of the city officials, and on this account
will be able to furnish his hearers an
insight into the practical government of
a modern metropolis.
