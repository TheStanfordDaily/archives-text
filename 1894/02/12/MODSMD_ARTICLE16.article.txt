The meeting of the Cla«s of '95 to
morrow afternoon will deal principally
with the junior hop and the choice or
election of a committee to manage the
affair. Suggestions, which might be
acted upon by the class, have come from
an absent member who mentions a jun
ior week or a junior day during which
a farce could be rendered by the class
in the afternoon, to be followed by the
dance in the evening. Something very
exceptional is generally expected from
this junior class, not only because of its
size but because it is the product of
this University ouly, and, to a certain
extent, the effects of environment and
the enterprise of the class will be judged
from the entertainment.
