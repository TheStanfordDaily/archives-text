Football T eam,Stauford University.
Dear Sir: Your letter of the sth
inst. only reached me this evening. I
note that you think it impossible to get
your team into training in time to g t.
up a game with the Berkeleys on the
22d inst , Washington's birthday.
Could it not be arranged for a* later
date?
If the freshmen cla-s of your Univer
sity would be willing to play a game ol
baseball on the 22d I will communi
cate with Berkeleys and try to arrange
it. though the time necessary for ad
vertising it and making the necersary
preparations is getting short. For that
reason please favor me with a prompt
reply, stilting the terms on which you
will be willing to play for the benefit of
Canadian Midwiuter Fair Auxiliary
Committee. Yours truly,
Fenton T. Newbury, Sec.
In answer to this letter Mcintosh has
replied that it is impossible for the '97
eleven to play. The baseball proposi
tion has been referred to Weluon, man
ager for '97 nine.
