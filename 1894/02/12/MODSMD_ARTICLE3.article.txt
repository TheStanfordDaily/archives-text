# The 						Rush.
## 
### 
The hatchet that was supposed to
have been buried by '9(5 and '97 at the
reception last semester has been
unearthed. Recollections of that occa
sion when the sophomores and fresh
men vied with each other in displaying
good feeling were lost Saturday night
in the mud and ooze of a newly
ploughed field back ot Encinu Hall.
Puring ihe afternoon several fresh
men and one sophomore were peacefully
engaged in a game of cards which termi
nated in the majority attempting to
deprive the minority of the second
inalienable right of every free citizen.
The tnaj irity-minority tables were soon
turned, however, and nearly a dozen
freshmen, including their president,
were captured, their faces smeared, and
their photographs taken in a room in
the h <â€¢ 11.
At ten o'oloek the rush proper began

by a mutual understanding that '97
would await '96 near the tank. It did
not take long to start matters rolling for
those contestants that did appear evi
dently came prepared fora scuffle, if
old clothes, shin-guards, and rope mean
anything. Itough and tumble wrest
ling of as many styles as their were
matches made the liveliest sport imag
inable for several score of upper class
men, whom, rumor has it, occasionally
overstepped the traditions of their digni
fied position uud did u .lttle more than
give verbal encouragement to the tyers
and the tied. It was a junior and a
senior who held aloft two flaming torches
for the benefit of tht spectators and the
contestants alike.
At midnight the freshmen had all
their opp merits either tied or parolled,
and the rush was ended. The sopho
mores claim that only thirty of their
men were in the contest. No one
counted the freshmen. The soft ground
resulted in no injuries except those to
pride. A dirtier looking lot of men
was probably never seen anywhere.
