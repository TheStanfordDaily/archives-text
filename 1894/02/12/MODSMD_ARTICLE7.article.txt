Text—What is man that thou art
mindful of him?
There are two strong characteristics
in the knowledge of men —knowledge
of God, who is unchangeable; and
knowledge of man who, in the structure
of his nature, is also unchangeable.
The three distinct divisions of the mind
are intellect, sensibility, and will. Our
physical being is by no means the least
fearfully and wonderfully made. If
there is any physical disorder in the
body there is a corresponding disorder
in the intellect. A blind man hearing
the beauty of a landscape spoken of will
think only of the taste of honey or the
smell of flowers. He will not have in
mind the glory of the hills and the sun
light.
Conscience is made up of two ele
ments —judgement, by which it de
cides like a judge from testimony; and
the sense of right and wrong. There
are many people in this world who are
waiting for some inner power to stir
their energies of life. The treatment
of the body is of great importance.
Over eating and under eating, over
sleeping and under sleeping, excessive
exercise, improper air, want of sunlight,
improper attitude in study—all these
things have their influence upon the
energy of the brain. Many people treat
themselves worse than they treat their
horses. I have seen young men in col
lege fall from sheer exhaustion on the
race track; they wonder in after months
what has caused their heart trouble
More people have been maimed and
killed by the game of football within
the last year than have been killed by
the brutality of the ring in the last six
years.
"Trust him in nothing who has not a
conscience in everything." The man is
pitiable who does not follow the sense
of right, let it lead wherever it may.
In this country, above all others, where
the government is so simple, man must
largely govern himself. There must be
somewhere a recognized standard of
right. The higher we raise this stan
dard in our institutions of learning the
more lofty will be our prospects for the
coining centurirs. We are going on to
reap the results from the sowing of the
seed today One who has supreme
motives, and whose soul is touched by
the motives that comedown to him from
the life above, cannot fail to look
soberly upon the struggles of today.
The common things of life are the best
things af'er all I know of no man so
us»ful as the man who can stir this
average life of ours, who can do the
common things the best.
