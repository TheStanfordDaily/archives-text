### 
A list of the periodicals that come
regularly to the office of the Daily
Palo Alto is here given. Only nine
teen of the forty-odd are on the ex
change list of the paper, while a num
ber of other papers come at irregular in
tervals.
The present management has at
tempted to place most of these period
icals where they might be of some use
after they have served the paper's pur
pose, and for that reason an effort has
been made to have them reach the
reading rooms of Encina and ltoble
Halls,
It has been suggested, however, that
the student body provide a reading room
and files for such exchanges as the Uni
versity publications wish to contribute.
This has been suggested in view of the
fact that a great many of the students
here have come from colleges and pre
paratory schools represented by the
publications in (juestion.
The Sequoia receives over eighty
exchanges, most of which might prob
ably be devoted to this purpose. If the
student body sees fit to take any action
in this matter it is safe to say that the
assistance of the University papers will
not be withheld.
