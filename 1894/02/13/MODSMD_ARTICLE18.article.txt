For three years the chemistry lec
ture room has been the most inconven
ient room in the quadrangle. With
seats arranged in long rows it is almost
impossible to cet a centre seat, the best
position for watching experiments. All
that is required to make it the best
lecture room we have, is the formation
of an aisle down the centre by the tak
ing up of the middle seat of each row.
As they remain, half the seats are be
ing broken by men who vault over them
into the tiers behind.
