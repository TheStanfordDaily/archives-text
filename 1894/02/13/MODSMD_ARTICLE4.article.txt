Last evening .J U. Wilson, '00, re
eeived frotu his father, ex-Marshal
('lias B Wilson of Honolulu, a very
rare fish, to be presented to the Uuiver

sity. It was caught in Pearl Harbor,
Jan. 25, then frozen in a block of ice,
and shipped by the steamer Australia.
Mr. Wilson writes that the fish is
unknown to most of the present natives
except by tradition. The earlier natives
called it apaliu, or god-fish, and be
lieved it to be the father of ahi, of the
Bonito family.
Pr Jenkins made a collection of
Hawaiian fi-hes some years ago, so this
fish has been turned over to him. He
says that it belongs to the genus lltin
zania, but it is possibly a new epecies.
It is related to the sun-fish, or mola, of
our coast Tliere are two specimens of
litinzonia truneatm in the British
Museum, which are probably the only
ones in :my collection. Mr. Wilson
has won the gratitude of our ichthyolo
gists by his invaluable contiibu'ion to
our collection.
