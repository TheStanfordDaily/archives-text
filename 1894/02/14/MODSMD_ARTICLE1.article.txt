# THE 						MISGOVERNMENT OF SAN FRANCISCO.
## City Attorney Reed's Lecture 
### 
The lecture in the chapel last even
ing was one of the m:st instructive
given this year After a few introduc
tory remarks, in which the speaker as
sured his audience that he intended to
give them what he knew from his
own knowledge, or what had been told
him by others, he spoke in part as
follows:
San Francisco is a consolidated city
and county. There are at least three
instances of this kind of government in
the United States: New York, Phi la -
and Si. Louis. The constitu
tion allows judicial, legislative, and ex
ecutive departments iu this city and
county government.
The justice court has five depart
ments, the judge being elected for two
years. Then there is the police court
of four departments, the judges for each
of which being elected for two years.
We have, then, the legislative depart
ment which comprises the board of sup
ervisors, twelve in number, elected one
from each of the twelve wards. This
board has the power to pass all ordi
nances regulating the business of the
city and county, and also to pass laws
punishing misdemeanors and other
crimes It al?o grants franchises and
levies taxes.
The board of supervisors is the prin
cipal department of the executive
branch of government. You might
think the mayor ought to hold that
place, but he does not. This board
spends the money itself that it rises by
taxes. It is worked by the committees,
the chairmen of which have large in
fluence in the department. As a
matter of course nothing but corruption
could result from such government.
The good points in Sm Francisco's
municipal government are two: First,
it is impossible for any corrupt official
to contract any debt without the consent
of two thirds of the voters of the city.
This provision was made in 1870. I
have examined the charters of several
cities and I find no provisions like it.
The taxes of a year have to pay all the
expenses fora year It requires about
86,000,000 to run Sin Francisco for
one year Last year it cost about
•35 800,000 The surplus will never be
paid; it is absolutely void. The city is
now in debt only 818.2,028 74, while
the indebtedness of New York. Brook
lyn, and eastern cities rues far up
into tlie millious. We have a very low
rate of taxation fixed by the constitu
tion, $1.03 on the SIOO of assessed
valuation; and 'aking into consideration
that the assessed valuation is not more
than one half the real value, we have
in reality only about fifty cents on the
$100. In Brooklyn and other cities it.
is much higher. Dennis Kearney
claims to have originated this low rate
of taxation.
Responsibility is distributed to the
last degree. It is generally agreed that
the bad municipal government in Nan
Francisco is earned by the lack of a re
sponsible officer at the head of the ex
ecutive department. The doctrine of
the separation of powers is violated;
that is, the legislative powers should
have nothing to <io with the judicial
and executive powers. In San Fran-

Cisco the supervisors, supposed to be
the law making body, is more of a
money making body. Perhaps the
prime fault is the assumption of the
control of local forces by the legisla
ture. What remains of the original
consolidation act of '56 would cover
about 30 pages, printed. The amend
ments to this act take up about 400
pages.
The people of San Francisco have a
great trust in ;he thieviug propensities
of their public officials. The mayor is
supposed to have general supcrvisoreal
powers over all other departments; but
he never exercises it, for the simple
reason that he cannot He only signs
all ordinances that are not of very great
importance. All power of protection
over the people has been taken away
from him. He is nothing more than a
figure-head.
Voting is mostly for private and not
municipal interests. Money raised by
supervisors is spent by a legislature that
does not consult the wishes of the peo
ple Park and other expenses are often
incurred against the protests of the
press and the property owners. Of
58.000 votes cast for mayor. 12 000
tailed to vote for police judges, and
about 15,000 failed to vote for members
for the board of education, because the
main interest centered in the national
ticket. City elections should be sep
arate from other elections. The super
visors of San Francisco are supervisors
simply because most of the people de
sire high protective tariff.
A superior court judge orders a new
carpet, new chairs, or a new desk. He
sends in his orders aud the supervisors
must pay them, while the claims of
some poor, honest man are laid aside.
These are often paid for extravagantly,
and the consequences of this sort of
business are more important than you
imagine; and there is no way to pre
vent these large bills incurred by the
judges from being paid.
The ward system is said to be an
other great cause of bad municipal
government. There are eighteen as
sembly districts, each of which is a uni
of political activity. Now, ifyou choose
your supervisor from a ward you cau
not always get as good a mau as you
want. The better classes live out in
the western addition. But look at the
Barbary Coast, and north and south of
Montgomery. No one lives there at all.
Yet, according to the ward system,
these places have to be represented.
I did not believe at one time that
men sold their honor for money, but I
believe it now. The most disgraceful
thing about San Francisco's govern
ment is the prevalence of bribery. For
instance, there is a street fight; one of
the men is arrested, taken before the
justice, allowed two days in which to
prepare his case. He goes to some big
politicial boss and gets him to go to the
judge and tell his honor what a nice
man the prisoner is. The result is
that the prisoner is acquitted or fined
$5 with "no alternative " Now this
judge is only bringing the law into dis
respect. Hut similar customs prevail
not only in the justice but in the su
perior courts. A glaring example of
the spoils system is seen in the custom
of the judges allowing to their sten
ographers whom they have power to ap
point, exorbitant salaries. They are
sometimes paid as high as $500 to 8900
per month for work requiring some
times only one hour's work a day.

The great system by which crimes
are found out is the grand jury system.
The members of that body are selected
from about one hundred and twenty
men, and the work of selection is left to
the bailiff, who manages to see that
only certain men are put on the jury.
Corporations and cable car companies
are thus well protected. Then we have
our police force, our city hell, our spoils
system, and our defective sewers, all of
which show the results of bad govern
ment.
Then there is the political ring
known as the primaries. Now the
primaries are the places where the del
egates and representatives are chosen.
There are political clubs already form
ing with a view of controlling the next,
primaries The president and ( fficers
are "the works." On the day of the
election "the works" have railings
around themselves and various hiding
places for tickets they do not like.
Speeial ballots have been prepared and
are recognized as soon as handed in,
and these only are counted. Moreover,
many of the politicians vo*e early and
often, as all good Democrats do. In
San Francisco a man can vote as often
as he likes provided he votes the right
ticket. So "the woi ks" invariably win,
and the conventions are composed of
men each of whom is representing his
boss.
And this is the municipal govern
ment of Nan Francisco. Unless the
inducement for these crimes is over
come we can never have a decent
government.
The speaker closed with an eloquent
appeal to all young men to help raise
this state of political degredation.
