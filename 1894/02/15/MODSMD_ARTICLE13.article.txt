At the meetings of the University
Science Association,and the Philological
Club, the papers read and subjects dis
cussed cover a wide field of inquiry,
and are often of general interest. Why
not have au arrangement by which these
could be popularized? Such a paper
as "Some Projections Observed on
Mars," expanded to cover all the phases
of the same subject, or even two or
three papers combined into one lecture
and delivered in the chapel, would prove
a source of profitable entertainment.
As an assurance that they would be
well attended witness the large number
of students who now visit the lectures
delivered in the different courses.
