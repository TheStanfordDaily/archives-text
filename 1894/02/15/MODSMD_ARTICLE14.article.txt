We commend with pleasure the
action taken by one of our j»r fessors
the other evening in tendering a recep
tion to a number of major students in
his department who have shown them
selves to be interested in their work.
They met togelliei ai»d discuar-cd the
work, and then had an enjoyable time
socially. It the students in the same
departments would meet together
oftener where the classroom formality
could be dispensed with, our social life
would not be such a hum drum affair.

More practical knowledge of the ques
tions that are brought up in class could
be obtained in one evening than is
possible in many of the daily lectures.
The class in the Administration of
American Cities will long remember the
pleasant visit made uuder the circum
stances outlined above.
