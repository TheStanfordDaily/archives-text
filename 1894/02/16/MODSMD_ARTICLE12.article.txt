A general protest is being made by
college men throughout the country
against professionalism in college ath
letics. In a new university, without, a
rich alumni backing, students can
scarcely realize the full significance of
this dangerâ€”a danger that should be
guarded against, for the evil is not yet
common. Legislation on this question
has been attempted this season in some
of the larger institutions in the east,
but there are still many loopholes by
which evasions are possible. This is
seen in the fact, that since the last foot
ball season some of the most prominent
athletes on the const have been ap
proached with offers from eastern colleges
of a part or the whole of their expenses
if they would enter these eastern insti
tutions. Such offers are not made by
any organization or representative ath
letic body, as a rule, but by individual's.
For this reason the evil is harder to
suppress, it being impossible to prove
anything, even where strong suspicion
of crookedness exists. The final solu
tion of fthe problem seems to lie in the
student body, especially in its athletic
constituency. No legislation whatso
ever can be effective when dishonorable
practices are winked at or openly sanc
tioned bj honorable men.
