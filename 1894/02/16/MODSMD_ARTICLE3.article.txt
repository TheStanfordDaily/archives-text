Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I have been asked to state the reasons
why it is not the policy of the Univer
sity to make Friday of next week, the
day following Washington's birthday, a
holiday. From one point of view I do
not think there are any such rea
sons. If study is a bore, and the TJni
verstiy routine an unpleasant grind, the
more holidays the better. Indeed, the
moderation of some students in this re
irard alone causes amazement. Why
should not every Friday be a holiday,
or every Thursday-to-Sunday-inelusive,
or the whole of every alternate week?
A little further evolution along this
line, and a continuous holidav(taking
the form of a permanent leave of ab
sence) will be in order, and may per
haps be the best issue for all concerned.
There are instructors and students,
however, who take the University ser
iously, who have planned definite lines
of work which it seems important to
accomplish. Most Ktudents must, make
sacrifices in one way or another iu order
to have these years for university train
ing, and they naturally prefer as few
interruptions as possible. Time means
something; and already the large num
ber of holidays seems to encroach un
duly upon university work. Certain
vacations are necessary, and these are
tsikeri account, of when university work
is planned. It is also well, perhaps, to
observe the usual d:iys of national sig
nificance. Hut why, in the case of
Washington's Birthday, which is not a
tlay of great celebration or of home re
unions, the holiday time should be ex
tended, passes the comprehension of
the ordinary mortal.
