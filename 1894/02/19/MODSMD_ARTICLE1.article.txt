# TWO VICTORIES FOR '97.
## The 						U.P. Defeated at Baseball and '96 Overpowered in the Rush. 
### 
Some little time before two o'clock
Saturday afternoon the open field east
of Eucina llall became the centre of
interest, and when the baseball game
was called over five hundred students
were gathered round the new diamond.
The nine for the University of the
Pacific appered iu suits in marked con
trast to the veteran garb of the home
team. They wore bicycle caps, white
shirts with butterfly collars, and black
cloth trousers. Tt was the first appear
ance on our grounds of a team from that
institution, which received so much
mention here during the first year.
But an interest in something to which
the game was tacitly understood to be
only preliminary prevented the visiting
team ftoin receiving the notice that is
'generally accorded such guests.
Just before the game started the
recognized big men of '96 paraded
across the diamond and took up their
stand near the coachers' lines at first
base, where they were constantly re
inforced until the crowd numbered
.ixty-four sophomores, all dressed iu
fighting clothes. On the opposite side
of the field near third base '97 collected
her forces to the number of sixty-two
rushers (not including the nine), all
attired in the wor.it, looking old clothes
ever seen on the campus.
Early in the game when the pros
pects for the freshman nine did not ap
pear the brightest the hopes of the si
lent crowd near third base were cheered
up by the arrival of a score of young
ladios wearing cardinal and green, the
97 colors, and later by the class yell
given by this same crowd of enthusiasts
who remained near the athletic de
fenders of their class.
