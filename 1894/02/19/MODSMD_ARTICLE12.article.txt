An extremely interesting program
was presented in Euphronia last Sat
urday evening; one that will long he
remembered by both members and
visitors. The program was opened
with an impromptu debate upon the
question, "Resolved, That it would he
for the best interests of this University
for interclass rushes to he prohibited."
Morrison, '95, argued for the affirma
tive and Poss, '97, for the negative.
The regular debate was upon the reso
lution, "Resolved, That the best means
of making up the present deficit in the
federal revenue would be by an income
tax." The affirmative was supported
by Bell and Hinsdill; the negative by
Catheart and Burcham. The society
decided in favor of the affirmative.
The closing piccc on the evening's pro

gram was a song by the huphronia
Quartet composed of Gunn, Hinsdill,
Foss, and Sand wick. The piece was
very favorably received and in the
future an occasional musical number
will serve to increase materially an
evening's entertainment.
