The Tennis Club met Friday after

Durand, gr., and Bars tow, '95, to go to
San Francisco during the vacation and
confer with a similar committee from
Berkeley concerning the formation of
an intercollegiate tennis league. They
will draw up a constitution of such an
association and arrange other prelim

club's representative on the Athletic
Board, reported that the tennis asso

University tennis affairs, under the con
dition that their power could be taken
away at any time.
