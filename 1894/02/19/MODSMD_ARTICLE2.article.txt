# THE 						GAME.
## 
### 
The freshmen gathered two runs in
the first inning by rea-on of Kirk's
pretty hit over second when two men
were on bases. Then they rested on
their laurels. The first two of the
visitors to go to hat were struck out,
but infield errors let in a run before the
side was retired Both sides were
blanked in the second inning. The
freshmen could do nothing in their half
of the third, and the U. of R men tied
the score on two phantom hits and an
error. Brown poked out a hit and
scored a run for the freshmen in the
fourth. The visitors then roused them
selves, and two good hits by Snyder and
Lewis, in connection with two errors,
put them one in the lead. Two more
hits gave IJ. I'. two more runs in the
fifth, while the freshmen could only
scratch out a single tally.
Fluui that on, however, the freshmen
prevented their opponents from scoring
Three innings went by with otdy or.e
run. In the ninth iuning with a final
desperate effort the freshmen scored
five runs on hits by Bumiller, Kirk, J
aud Weldon, and won the game.
