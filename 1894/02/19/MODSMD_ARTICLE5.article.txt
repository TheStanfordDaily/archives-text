# The 						Essentials of Religion.

### 
Rev. Mr. Spranue of the Unitarian
church of San Francisco delivered the
address Sunday morning. The heavy
rain prevented the usual crowded
ihapel that regularly listens to such
discourses, but those who were fortun
ate enough to he present heard a good
sermon, a brief synopsis of which is
here given.
What doth the Lord require? That
we "do justice, have mercy, and walk
humbly with God
We are living in a time when men
are no longer satisfied with the husks of
denomitiationalism, with the external
things that men have called religion.
Men are looking for the . essentials of
true faith, true worship, true life.
The keynote that will bind all sys
tems is the Godward yearning of the
human heart If all men will come to
realize that, there will be less narrow
ness in the world ot theorized religion;
less eouflict between science and relig
ion. Not what you think or I think
about God is essential; but that yearn
ing toward God of our hearts is essen
tial. It is not whether I interpret this
passage or that passage this way or that
way, but whether I gain true spiritual
thought.
There are many speculations about
Jesus, whether he existed before his
birth, whether he was wholly human or
wholly divine. Hut what matter they
all? More, what Jesus is to us, is Zor
aster to the Zurastists, is Moses to the
Hebrews, Huddha to the Huddhists
The striving of the human heart is the
same in all climes and times, and Christ,
Zoraster, Moses, and Huddha represent
the ideal human lite, to which all men
aspire.
Again, we hear many different
theories of heavf n The Jews believed
it to have golden streets and pearly
gates. Is that essential? The essen
tial thing is to look out and up and
feel that something divine shall follow
this world-life; to live with a conscious
ness that life is eternal, that we are
spirits here and now and ever shall be
Then, too, in these days we hear a
good deal about character. The things
that I cherish may seem to you to have
little meaning; we think differently of
what is requisite to the up-building of
the human soul Hut we both aim at
one essential: to get into obedience with
the law which is about us, to live in
harmony with the eternal rules. We
arc just coming to see that all
people are striving to this end. That
is the glorious thought of our century.
Men are coming to realize that they are
one in their purposes and struggles of
life.
This I mean to emphasize: that re
ligion ; s a matter of personal life, not a
matter to be swayed by authorities, or
dictated to by creeds. It is the life of

the individual soul in relation to the
universe.
I would that you might all read that
great essay of Emerson's on the "Over
Soul." It is the gospel of the latest
day religion, the great gospel of good
tidings to those who are hound by old
and by-gone thoughts, ltead it as the
revelation of a diviner life in the hu
man heart. Gain the pieture it gives
and you shall have the largest and no
blest and most imposing faith that the
sons of men yet realized.
Think not that your own little
thought is all there is in the world.
Strive to the limits of your power to get
into sympathy with all that makes the
world fair to others. Realize that the
same ties bind all men and all womeu
to the heart of God, and when you
have found those ties yon have found
the sum and substance of all religion.
