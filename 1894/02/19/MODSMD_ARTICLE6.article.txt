Editor Daily Palo Alto:
We have been asked t<> state the fol
lowing, in reference to the Registrar's
communication in Friday's issue. The
reason for asking that the day following
Washington's Birthday should be made
a holiday is that a mid-week holiday is, to
the most of us, one only in name The
students to whom' ''study is a bore aud
the University routine an unpleasant
grind" (if there be such) will do the
same amount of work whether Thursday
is declared a holiday or not. Students
of the other class derive no benefit from
the intermission, for there is no oppor
tunity to improve it by a trip home, or
to San Francisco, and at the same time
prepare for Friday recitations. It, is
true that we have a good many holidays.
It is also true that, many studeuts em
ploy those holidays, as well as Saturday,
Sunday, and vacation in study. The
question, however, is not of the number
of holidays, nor of the occasions they
celebrate, but of their distribution.
Most of us would prefer one holiday on
Friday to two on Thursdays. V\ e
would rather have no holiday than one
which simply interrupts the University
work without offering any opportunity
tor recreation.
The action ot the Associated Students
was. we believe, merely an expression
of this opinion.
