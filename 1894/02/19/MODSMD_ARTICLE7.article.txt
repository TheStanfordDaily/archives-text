In reply to the request fora holiday
Friday, Dr. Jordan says that he does
not believe it is a good thing, giving as
a reason the number of holidays which
will occur before commencement.
In regard to Mr. Zion's statement
that Dr. Jordan had authorized the
students to fix their own holidays, the
president says that his remarks were in
tended only in a Pickwickian sense.

[The above was signed by the same
committee of the Associated Students
which has signed the communication.
Below is a remark from the president
of the student body in defense of his
action in the recent student meeting. ]
Not only myself hut also A. C.
Trumbo, '04, and W (J Ilazzard, '05,
who were present when Dr. Jordan
made his statement that the Associated
Students could declare holidays, took
the matter seriously. E. R. Zion.
