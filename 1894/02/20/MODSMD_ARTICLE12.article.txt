In another column is the notice of a
meeting held this afternoon for the pur
pose of organizing a press club. This
is something that has been needed for
some time, since it will afford a mcins
of exchanging ideas over journalistic
work. Most of the men on the daily
and weekly have to feel their way to a
very great extent. By a club that ar
ranges for the spread of journalistic
ways and means much of this uncer
tainty may be removed. In some re
spects the direct advantages to be
gained by the club are not apparent,
but the indirect ones, such as discus
sion on the best way to obtain news and
the best way to publish it, will without
doubt be of great service to amateur
journalists.
There are many students in the Uni
versity who have not assisted in the
publication of either of our papers and
who yet should become members. In
tending writers and those in literary
courses should especially take advantage
of it and in this way get an acquaint
ance with the requisites for real jour
nalistic life.
