The rusli that made many tnon ner
vous fur the whole of the last week
passed off without any damage to per
son. There have been some adverse
comments on the advisability of having
class rushes, and it has even been
hinted that those in authority intend to
suppress them. This is quite improb
able. Nothing has been condemned
up to the present which the students
have done in a fair and manly way. The
sijjht of a scratched face is no reason
for opposing a rush. Men entirely un
known and unappreciated get a chance
on these occasions to show that they
have stuff a»id material in them that
does credit to us all.
The style of rush is novel. Unlike
cane rushes, where the victory goes to
the most heartless side and often re
sults seriously for many contestants,
the victory goes to the best men, to the
strongest men, to the most expert

wrestlers. Being bound hand and foot
does damage to dignity only. In view
of the fairness of the contest of last
Saturday it seems unlikely that the
rushes here will die from any cause
than common consent.
