# The 						Oratorical Contest.
## 
### 
A letter lias been received from the
Examiner by the committee on orator
ical contest, stating that the offer made
some time ago of 8100 in gold will be
given upon the conditions the students
themselves may arrange. There will
probably be a meeting of the committees
from the two universities some time
this week, when all arrangements, in
cluding the date and the place of the
contest, will doubtless be settled upon.
