# The 						'96-'97 Rush.
## 
### 
As soon as the last put-out was made
the sophomores started across the dia
mond, and the crowd stood up and
moved forward in expectation. The
freshmen fell back, but only fora
moment, to csist off unnecessary hats,
caps, and coats, which had served as a
protection from the occasional drizzling
rain during the ball game. Then they
moved forward and resumed their orig
inal stand, eagerly eyeing the cautious
advance of their opponents. Both sides
evidently had certain dangerous char
acters whom they were locating in order
to dispose of first.
Frankenheimer darted from the crowd
and attempted to circle into the fresh
man ranks but was downed at once, and
a half dozen of both sides fought where

he fell, while the contest imme
diately became general. In less than
two minutes not a man remained on his
feet. The soft ground, just tinted
green with young grain, was covered
with writhing, struggling groups, among
which upper-classmen disported them
selves in wild delight and
the contestants.
Strands of tarred rope and a few
pairs of handcuffs made up the effective
armament of '96, while '97 likewise
produced as fast as occasion demanded
insulated wire and lengths of rope
twisted with wire. Several sophomores
succeeded in locking a handcuff on one
of Fickert's wrists before he received
reinforcements, and the glisteuing
bracelet with its long pendant re
mained on him till evening. Cochran
was bound and dragged over where the
spectators could have a better look at
him. Again and again men were
loosened, but in the long run wire
proved more effective than tarred rope,
which cannot be untied but is easily
cut.
At the end of an hour every sopho
more was securely bound and the cap
tives were collected in one group, where
several snap shots were taken of them.
"llepta Ki! Enanakonta! '97! Bah,
Rah, Rah!" went up with far more
vigor than was ever put into it before,
for there was no "Rah, Rah, Ru! Rah,
Rah, Rix! M, D! Three C! X, C! Six!"
or the parody of "Hepta Ki! Euana
konta! Washing and Ironing' Rah,
Rah, Rah!" to detract from it.
Most of the men were escorted to
Encina IJall near by, and were soon
after liberated. But two buses were
pressed into service to carry off the
most worthy defenders of '96 to have
their pictures taken. Whitehouse,
Lyon, Reynolds, Cochran, Field, Frank
enheimer, Spalding, Bernhardt, Haz
zard, Toombs, McDonnell, and several
others, were driven to Redwood, five
miles away, undur guard of Thomas,
Greenwood, Ric3, Brown, and others.
Their arrival in town collected u crowd
in the streets, and the constable's re
monstrances caused them to leave
Those in the first bus were liberated
one by one along the road only to fall
upon and overpower the second bus and
later to capture the first bus and com
pel the '97 guards to walk home.
