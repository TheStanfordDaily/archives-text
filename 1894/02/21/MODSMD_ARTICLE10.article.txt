Endeavors to introduce out-of-door
athletics at Wellesley have met with
marked success. Up to the opening of
1802 no system of out-door work had
been given the students. Rowing was
then introduced under careful super
vision, and aroused such interest that
175 of the young women competed for
positions on the crews.
The Class of '96 raised $2,500 to
build a boat house last year, and Dr.
W. A. Brooks, a former oarsman of
Harvard, coached the crews The
trustees of the college have granted the
use of three acres of land southeast of
Stone Hal! for an athletic field,
money was needed to put this field in
repair, the Class of'o7 raised $1,250.
A running track is being made and the
ground laid out for tennis and basket
ball.— Princetonian.
