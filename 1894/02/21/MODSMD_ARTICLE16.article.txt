Twelve men have been chosen by
the three literary societies for the pre
liminary debates to be held early in
March, and so far as any arrangements
that have yet been made are concerned
the student body must select its repre-
s a ntatives in the Berkeley debate from
these. One of the reasons why the
student body took charge of the inter
collegiate debate instead of delegating
the selection of debaters to the literary
societies, was that there is much good
material outside the societies. If any
of this outside material is to be drawn
on, opportunity ought immediately to
be given fora contest with the repre
sentatives from the societies. It will
not be long till the big debate occurs,

and surely no one ought to be elected
to represent the University until he has
shown what he can do.
