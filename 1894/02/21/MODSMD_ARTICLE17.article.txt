Th k deadly joke played on the fresh
man class at Cornell, in which a woman
lost her life, is one of the most regret
able occurrences that ever took place
in any college. Because of the ignor
ant or reckless action of three or four
students the whole sophomore class of
Cornell has had a serious crime laid at
its door. The perpetrators of the deed
will undoubtedly be discovered, for the
police are in possession of valuable clues
and have the help of both the faculty
and students; but in the meantime every
member of the sophomore class feels
himself under suspicion. This occur*
rence ought to be a warning to rash
practical jokers who carry things to ex
tremes, as well as to those who coun
tenance such dangerous pleasantry.
