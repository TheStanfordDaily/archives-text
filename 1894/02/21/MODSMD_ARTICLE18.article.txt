Editor Daily Palo Alto:
To your last issue was a communication
pertaining to another system of mark
ing for our present + , Â±, The
statement was made that by this system
one could not tell his relatively high or
low standing in his study.
We miirht ask of what use is an ex
amination? There ought at least, to be
two benefits: first, to indicate to the
student by the questions the lines ol
important thought and comparisons;
second, partly, and only partly, to indi
cate to the professor what the student
knows of the points indicated and
whether they are clear in his mind or
not. An examination is not a true test
of a student's ability, for he may be
very clear on many other points and
fail to pass the examination. The ob
ject of an examination ought to be, be
sides the above reasons, to help the pro
fessor to determine in addition to daily
work whether the student has gained
sufficient power to do more advanced
work.
Tliis can be most easily indicated by
our present system, and any thorough,
earnest student can classify himself as
A U, C, 1). or K, if he so desires. Let
us hope no change will be made in our
system of marking. P. I),
