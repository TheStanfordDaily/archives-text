# An Intercollegiate Debating League.
## 
### 
A circular has been sent out to the
debating societies of the principal
eastern colleges, inviting them to send
delegates to a convention to form an
intercollegiate debating league. The
object of the proposed league is to
secure more frequent intercollegiate
debates, and to make the work in the
individual societies uniform. ThÂ«
North American Review, the Arena,
and Public Opinion have e*ch promised
to devote a fixed I amount of space to
discussions of the subjects of each
month's debates. It is expected that
Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia,
U of P , Brown, Dartmouth, Amherst,
Williams, Cornell, and Wesleyan, with
some others, will be represented.
