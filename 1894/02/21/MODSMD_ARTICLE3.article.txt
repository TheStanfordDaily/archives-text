# A 						Report That Is Denied.

King will coach Stanford next sea
son. This is startling news for the
Berkeley boys, and will he received
with much doubt, but it is authentic.
Manager Lang of the university foot
ball team received the news from the
east recently, and for various reasons
deemed it best not to make it known
before this. . . . Stanford has got
him for 81,000 and expenses.â€”Oakland
telegram in Sau Jose Mercury, Feb. 22.
Our football men deny the truth of
this rumor. Capt. Downing wrote to
King and in reply Kin<> wrote that he
was already engaged for the season.
From this it is inferred that the report
that he will coach the Cornell team is
correct.
