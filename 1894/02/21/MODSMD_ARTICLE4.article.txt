# '95 To Be Photographed Again
## 
### 
As a sufficiently large number of
members of the Class of '95 who were
not present when the picture was taken
for ''The Stanford Quad" have re
quested that another photograph be
made, I accordingly announce that the
class will be re-photographed next
Tuesday at 1:20 p.m. This is done in
simple fairness and justice to fully
twenty members of the class who were
omitted from representation. The pic
ture of the Pioneer Class that goes in
the first annual should represent, the
whole class and not a majority of the
numbers. J. J. Hollister, Pres.
