# MISS HOSMER AND HER LECTURE.
## A 						Walk Through the Sculpture Galleries of the Vatican. 
### 
Harriet Hosmer was born at Water
town, Mass, O it. 0, 1880. At an
early age she did some clay modelling.
Later she took the course in anatomy in
tlie St. Louis Medical College. In
1852 she went to Home and entered
the studio of John (jibson, the English
sculptor lu a short time she had at
tracted considerable attention by her
ideal busts of "Daphne" and " Medusa."
In 1855 she executed a statue of
"Puck'* of such merit that thirty copies
were ordered, and her reputation was
established.
Her work since then has been on a
great variety of subjects, from decora
five fountains to colossal statues. Her
statues have been shown in all the great
art exhibitions and now occupy places
in famous parks, libraries, and art col
lections. Her latest work is the heroic
statue of Isabella, exhibited at the
World's Fair and now at the Midwinter
Fair.

The crowded chapel which greeted
.Miss Hosuier Friday night was re
warded by a delightfully informal art
talk, a synopsis of which is here given.
Crossing the bridge of Saint Angelo
and turning to the left we see the magni
ficent pile, St. l'eter's and the Vatican.
Our first impression ol St. l'eter's is lia
ble to be disappointing, because our
ideas of it are too vast. Its location is
unfortunate, failing to show off the true
grandeur of the structure.
One of the most striking figures we
run across in the great corridor of the
Roman Vatican is a second-rate copy of
the Marble Faun, which Hawthorne has
immortalized. It is an interesting
piece of work because it shows that the
ancient sculptors nude several copies of
their works. Many people insist upon
having a first eopy, ignorant that the
second copy is often much superior to
the first. There are three copies of the
Marble Faun, of which the one in the
capitol is the best. Nothing has come
down to us in manusjript of the way in
which ancient sculptors worked. Rut
we know that instead of using plaster
of Piris they used wax, the former be
ing unknown to them.
Passing on we come to the beautiful
statue of the Minerva Medici, which
was found in the temple of Medici. It
possesses the finest drapery of any
statue known. She is also famous for
her beautiful toes. The sculptors of
olden times paid great attention to the
toes and the hands. The hand was al
ways represented as holding something.
It is invariably a sign of restoration to
find the hands free. There is a grand
statue of Demosthenes just preparing to
speak. Near by are statues that have
attracted great attention and hnve been
copied hundreds of times. One is a
work called Modesty, beautifully veiled,
and the other is a bust of young Au
gustus. I remember when this statue
was found near Rome. It was beauti
fully colored, and showed that in olden
times sculptors used color upon their
marble work. This bust of young Au
gustus is the finest bust in the Vatican
Michael Angelo's Torso attracts our at
tentionâ€”that work upon which he
studied so many years, a statue of Her
cules.

As we pass through these great halls
the first thought that strikes us is how
few masterpieces there are. A dozen
would number them all. This is at
once a matter of encouragement and
despair: encouragement for us to per
severe; despair when we reflect how
difficult it is to do well.
Many of the statues that were found
broken have been restored in a most
faulty manner. Several years ago a
copy of the Venus of Milo was found
and was very interesting as showing
the exact position of the hands and
arms in the original. The right hand
rested upon one of the shoulders, the
left upon the hip. There is a great
bronze statue of Hercules that was
found in the bottom of the river beauti
fully preserved, and showing how per
fect bronze work, was in olden times.
The ancients always put some object
in the hands of their statuary for three
reasons: The open hand is easily broken
oflf; the composition was made as compact
as possible; the hand is more graceful
when holding something.
The old sculptors never inscribed on
their work, "made by so and so."
They always put on it, "so and so was
making." In olden times they tried
to see how well they could work; now
a-days we try to see how much we can
do. The true artist works for the one
in a million who can appreciate the
beauty of a higher ideal.
