Text, 11. Timothy, iv., fi, 7, and 8.
When the Apostle Paul wrote these
words he was not far from seventy
years o*' ajre and was imprisoned in
Rome charged with sedition against the
Koman Empire. His had been a life
of triumph in spite of the ridicule of
the Greeks and the insincerity of his
church people.
As the second aspect of his life, he
wrote: "1 have completed my alloted
task." His work seemed to be done,
and so it was. Whether young or old
the dying has completed his mission,
his alloted task. Our Savior himself
died at the early age of thirty-three.
Yet he himself declared upon the cross,
"It is finished."
As a third aspect of his life, Paul
wrote: "I have kept the faith." In
his personal love for the Almighty, in
every phase of his life, he had kept the
faith; and as a result he was crowned
with all the glory of the triumph he de
served .
