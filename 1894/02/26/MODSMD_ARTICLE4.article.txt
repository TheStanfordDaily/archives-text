The same Saturday afternoon on the
new diamond was another victory for
the Varsity over the second nine, mak
ing the series four to two in favor of
the former.
Ray pitched for the Varsity and only
four hits, divided between James and
Johnson, were made off his delivery.
The same number of hits, two of which
were scratches, were made off Weldon.
His support failed occasionally, aud
the first nine kept well in the lead dur
ing the entire game. The Varsity
infield went to pieces in the last iuniug,
but recovered before much damage was
done. The score was as follows:
