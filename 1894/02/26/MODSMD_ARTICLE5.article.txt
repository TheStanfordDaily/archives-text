# Baseball Matters.
## 
### 
The following men will appear in
uniform in front of Kncina tomorrow
(Tuesday) at 4 p.m., to have a baseball
picture taken for the annual: Walton,
McLaine, White, C. Ray, Durand, C.
Downing, P Downing, Davey, Lewis,
Dyer, Ed. Ray, Calhoun, Harrelson,
Bumiller, Weldon, and Sheehan.
A game will probably be played with
the faculty this week, in which the
batteries will be interchanged in order
to equalize the teams.
On next Saturday the season will be
formally opened by a game with the
St. Mary's, either on the home diamond
or at the Midwinter Fair athletic
grounds in San Francisco, if the latter
arc finished by that date.
All arrangements for the intercollegi
ate league will be completed tomorrow
evening in San Francisco at a meeting
of the executive committee at which
Cox, '95. will represent Stanford.
