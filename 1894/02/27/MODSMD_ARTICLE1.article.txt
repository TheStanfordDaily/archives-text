# DR. EVERMANN'S LECTURE.
## The
						Fur Seal and the Fur Seal Investigation. 
### 
It was a very interesting and instruc
tive lecture to which the students lis
tened yesterday evening; and being
delivered by a man who acquired a
knowledge of the subject from careful
observation as a United States official,
it was thoroughly reliable. An inter
esting fact was brought to the notice of
the auditors, in the position of the most
westerly island of the Alaskan peuin
sula, which, as a western limit of our
possessions, makes the centre of the
United States four hundred miles west
of San Francisco.
After the treaty of arbitration be
tween Great Hritian and the United
States was signed, it was decided to
send soin one into the northern seas to
investigate the life and habits of the
fur seal. It fell to my lot to be chosen,
and the result of my investigations I
will give you this evening.
The fur &eal breeds in but few placcs
in the world. Along the rocky shores
of Alaska and upon the little islands in
the northern Pacific they land for breed
ing purposes during the autumn and
part of the winter months. About the
first of .January they begin to scatter
again, Some years ago the Russians
made laws regarding the killing of
seals, the most-important of which were
that only so many seals could be killed,
and that uo fema'es could be slaugh
tered For instance, a hundred thousand
seals might be captured each year, pro
vided the number was not found, upon
investigition, to be excessive.
About 188G sealers found out that
they could carry on the business in the
open sea. Within a short time twenty
vessels were engaged in this business,
and by 1892 the number had swelled to
one hundred and twenty. Upon the
islands no females were ever killed, but
ir the open sea they were slaughtered
by the wholesale. The number of seal
skins brought to market in San Fran
cisco never represents the number of
seals killed, fora large number are
lost. It was proposed sometime ago to
establish a three-mile limit and allow
no seals to be killed inside of that.
Hut this would amount to nothing be
cause the majority of seals go out hun
dreds of miles to feed.
In our expedition we were to be as
sisted by native hunters; we wero to
shoot every kind of fur seal, male and
female, and to keep a record of the num
ber and how they died, and keep a
record of those that escaped; to shoot
them in different parts of the body; and
to find out what they lived upon; to in
vestigate the r ookeries; and to in
terview the native seal hunters. Two
little islands, St. Paul and St. George,
several hundred miles due west of Sitka,
are the most important breeding places
in the northern Pacific. During cer
tain periods of the year seals swarm in
myriads upon the shores of these is
lands.
Our investigations carried on for six
months or more partially bore out the
claims made by our government, but not
so in every feature. There is no evi
dence that the seals of the Russian is
land mix with ours.
A scries of steriopticon views were

shown illustrative of the scenery of
the Alaskan sealing grounds, the life in
that country, and the "rookeries" of
the seals. The lecturer's descriptions
of the killing of the seals were interest
ing.
'â€¢The chief of the island Indians," he
said, ''determines from which hauling
ground the seals can be killed. A lit
tle over the number of seals desired are
herded inland to the killing ground.
The next morning everybody goes down
to see the killing. Several natives
armed with long hickory clubs sur
round the "pod" and the seals are
killed by a single blow delivered upon
the head. After being carefully re
corded the skins are salted and stored
away until they are shipped to San
Francisco, where they are again counted
and weighed.
