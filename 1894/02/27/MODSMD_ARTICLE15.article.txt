From almost every visitor who has
spokeu tu ua fur some lime past we liave
received congratulations upon leing col
lege students and upon enjoying the
benefits of steam and electiicity. This
trite and untrue trash is being retailed
to a great extent by many students
among us. Blinding themselves in
this way by an untrue appreciation of
their position, they have come to think
that a college man is sure to command

respect and fortune wherever he goes,
little dreaming that half the men here
are only preparing in themselves new
avenues for disappointment and en
couraging ambitions that will ever make
their life tragic because of the discrep
ancy between their ability and their
aims.
In some parts of the student body
this self-congratulation hat gone so far
as to make them believe that none but
weak drivellers slay out of college.
How far this is true will be soou dis
covered when they come into competi
tion with men who have far more initia
tory power, far more executive ability
than the college man, because they have
fewer of the ideals and fewer of the
scruples bred by a studious life. When
men come to leave the University it
would be of much more service to them
to know that in many instances they
will be handicapped by their training
than to leave with an over-weening es
timate of the power they have obtained
by mental discipline.
