# Complimentary Tickets for the Ice Skating Rink.
## 
### 
Mr. Herkkrt S. llicks,
Business Manager Sequoia.
Dear Sir:—We desire to extend to
the Stanford University the courtesy of
our rink at some stated night in the
near future, and to this end we would
ask you to take the matter up with us
and have a day set as early as possible.
The way we would propose to do this
would be to extend an invitation to all
the students and their intimate frieuds.
We will then get out special compli
mentary tickets of admission and could
send them perhaps to you, and you
could probably have some one distribute
the tickets in the proper way right
there on the ground. I will try and
make soaie arrangements with the rail
road companies fora cheap fare, and
the night they are here we can put on
a polo game or an indoor baseball game
which would amuse the boys very
much. We shall endeavor to interest
the college boys both of Stanford and
Berkeley enough in our rink for them
to organize polo, baseball, and football
teams, matches to be played at our
rink.
We never saw a football game on ice,
and think it would be very amusing.
The boys could wear rubbers on their
feet and it would be just slippery
enough to be interesting, and at the
same time much cleaner than a football
field. Polo and indoor baseball pro
mise to be very interesting games on
skates, and if we can get the two col
leges competing in any of these games
it will afford a great deal of amuse
ment.
If you will kindly take this matter up
and aid us all you can, giving us about
the number of students there are at
Stanford, and naming a day (any day
but Saturday the 3d of March), and any
other points that may be of aid to us,
we will be very much obliged and we
will try very hard to please the boys if
they will only come. Yours very truly,
Natural Ice Skating Campany,
W. N. Donaldson, Gen. Mgr.
