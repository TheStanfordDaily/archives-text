# The 						'95 Assessment.
## 
### 
As there are many persons in the
Class of '95 who could easily get adver
tisements for"The Stanford Quad"
from the firms with whom they do their
trading, it has been decided that all
those who get one page of advertise
ments will be released from the assess
ment made by the class for the annual.
Further information or blanks for con
tracts may be had from N. G. Huxton.
