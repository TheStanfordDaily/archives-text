signed by Representative IJainer of
Rhode Island:
Under the ruling of the P. 0. Dept.
all papers published under the auspices
of college and fraternal* societies are
now or will be denied admission to the
mails as second class matter and com
pelled to pay from eight to sixteen
times as much postage as other papers.
This is a manifest injustice which
bears heavily on a class of papers pub
lished not for pecuniary profit but in
the cause of education and which
deserve at least as liberal treatment as
any.
It is a reproach to the system that
cheap novels, the Police Gazette, and
such papers are entitled to postal priv
ileges denied to the educational and
fraternal journals.
To remedy the manifest injustice
Senator Manderson and myself have
each introduced in our respective houses
of Congress a bill, a copy of which is
enclosed for your consideration.
The Stanford yell was given in honor
of Prof. Howard and the professor's
face flushed with pleasure as he bowed
in acknowledgment. An outsider can
scarcely understand the altissimo of en
thusiasm which Prof. Howard's name
produces among all university students.
Not ODly do all his old students worship
him with zealous loyalty, but, the new
students who have never been in his
classes, who never saw him till Thurs
day night, have so often heard the ipse
dixit that they seem by a sort of college
heredity to have inherited the univer
sal veneration feeling. The professor
has left »-uch very great traditions be
hind him that even to students who
have never known him there is a whole
dynamo of spiritual force locked up in
his very name.—Nebraska State Jour
nal, Feb. 17.
