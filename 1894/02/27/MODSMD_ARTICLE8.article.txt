Do not forget the Tennis Club meet
ing tomorrow at 1 :20 p.m., in room 94,
quadrangle.
Miss M. Uurke, and Messrs. Rice
and Ilinsdill, all of'9s. have been ap
pointed by the Associated Students as
the Midwinter Fair committee.
Today the Class of'9s again had its
photograph taken for the annual.
Apparently there were not quite so many
present today as there were when the
picture was taken some weeks ago.
