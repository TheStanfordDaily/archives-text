# MISS SCHALLENBERGER'S LECTURE.
## Children's Rights. 
### 
The speaker was introduced by Prof.
Barnes as his partner in the work of
the department of education. Not only
did the lecture furnish an insight into
the valuable investigations that are be
ing carried on by the department, but
many of the peculiar workings of chil
dren's minds were exemplified. 1
I once overheard a conversation be
tween a scientist and a business man, in
which the former declared that the day
would come when men would live
among monkeys with a view of finding
out their language and thought, and
would do this in the interest of truth.
It is truth that forms the great back
ground of pictures of earnest lives.
In our kindergarten work we have
given great emphasis to the ethical life
of children. The natural instincts of
children instead of being bad are good.
So the education of children should be
in accordance with this ethical principle
We are not ahso'utely sure how chil
dren think, but we know that feeling or
emotion is oue strong force in human
life, and that feeling, far more than in
tellect, is moved by concrete conditions.
''But. a child is a human being and
therefore cannot be studied as we would
study a stone or an ape." This is an
erroneous opinion. Until they can have
the privilege of being observed as we
study any other scientific investigation,
we can never hope for any real knowl
edge concerning them. The one who re
veres children most is the person who
talks the least concerning his love for
them.
This is an age of investigation, and
while we are concerning ourselves with
the rights of women, and the like, why
not consider the rights of children
Some time ago the department of edu
cation of this University sent out to the
teachers of the state syllabi entitled
"Children's rights as seen by them
selves. "
The questions were as few and definite
as possible. The names and ages of the
children were required, and teachers
were instructed to observe when chil
dren began to recognize their own rights;
when those of others; when they began
to claim the right to use or destroy
their own property; and many other
questions of like import. We sent
with these, two little stories involving
ethical principles to be worked out ac
cording to the opinions of the children,
who were to be between the ages of six
and sixteen. The answers represented
the evolution of childhood from a state
of barbarism to one of civilization,
showing that children in the course of
years pass through much the same
development as people through the
influence of epochs of civilization.
The older children, for instance, have
higher ideas than the younger. The
gills showed themselves to be more
mercifully inclined than the boys.
Several of the answers showed the in
fluence of home training upon the eth
ical ideas of children. Also that young
children are less merciful than older
ones. Young children judge actions
by results; older oues consider the mo
tives behind them.
These investigations are not only of
bent fit to the student and to science, but

{children are also benefited by them, for
I the better children are known the hap
! pier they will be.
