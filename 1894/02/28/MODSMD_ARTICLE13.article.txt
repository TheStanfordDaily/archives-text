Tomorrow's meeting of the Associ
ated Students is one of utmost impor
tance and oue which every student in
the University should attend The ex
ecutive committee, after careful deliber
ation, found so many subjects for
change in the present constitution that
it seemed advisable to embody the
whole in a new constitution. The wis
dom of the proposed changes must be
decided by the student body and every
one, either in favor of or opposed to the
new constitution, should be prepared to
support his position.
The meeting will also be of interest
on account of the reports of the various
committees now acting. Time is draw
ing near for important intercollegiate
contests, and some decisive action must

be taken. The treasurer reports that he
has ouly one or two dollars on hand, and
cannot furnish the twelve dollars and
fifty cents appropriated l'or a declama
tion contest at the last meeting. The
Midwinter Fair committee desires to
have au appropriate amount placed to
its credit for use on Stanford Day. The
committee on oratory and debate also
need money for current expeuses. Aside
from the above some money ought to be
expended to provide rustic benches
for the, campus, tennis courts, arbor
etum, and other little conveniences
which make college life enjoyable. To
provide funds for all these purposes an
assessment seems necessary.
