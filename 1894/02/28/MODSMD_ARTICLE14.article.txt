President Jordan, besides possessing
a good brain and a man's courage, has
an engine's force. Not only does he
push the Stanford University ahead, but
i the rivalry has shaken Berkeley out of
! its sleep. This awakening has, as yet,
| resulted nrrely in distress; but in the
! end the State University will have to
| spring up and do. That cannot happen,
jof course, until the Board of Regents
| has been reorganized and some of the
amiable and learned gentlemen of the
faculty have been replaced with men
who understand that they are living
|in the preseut century. Hut these
| changes will come. They must.
