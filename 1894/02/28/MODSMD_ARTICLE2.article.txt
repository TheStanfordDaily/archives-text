Editor Daily Palo Alto:
We should like to call the attention
of the student body to Article 11, Sec
tion 9, of the proposed constitution rela
tive to the paying of a percentage sal
ary to the manager of the football team.
It is peculiarly the custom at s:udent
body meetings to rush things through
without reflection. As a rule what
ever motion is made is sure to carry, for
no one ever dares to oppose it. This
question, however, is one of more im
portance than usually comes before the
student body. The honor of being
elected to so responsible a position as
football manager ought to be enough to
induce any studeut to undertake the
work. That university is badly off in
deed where there is not sufficient loy
alty and college spirit to make its offices
desirable except as money prizes. We
de not believe that Stanford will ever
reach such a state. When it does
there will be no need of a football man
ager. The man who would be in
fluenced to undertake such an impor
tant position only for the money there
is in it is not the man who should fill it.
There will of necessity be nnfavorable
seasons to any organization as well as
seasons of prosperity. It is conceivable
that a rain on the day of the great game
with Berkeley might decrease the re
ceipts to oue half what they would be
in good weather. Such exigencies are
not dcpcudcnt upon the push of the
manager. Would it not be better to let
all the profits of prosperous seasons go
to balance the deficit of less prosperous
ones, than to pay a large percentage of
them to the manager.
We cannot see that the manager of
the football team is better entitled to
receive a salary than the captain or any
of the players. His labors are certainly
no more arduous. A step farther and
there are other offices worthy of salary.
The treasurer finds it difficult to col
lect assessments and should be given a
percentage; the president must be paid
by the hour for conducting the meet
ings. But enough! Let the student
body itself decide whether its offices are
to become mercenary or not. To adopt
such a clause in the constitution is to
declare that there is no honor in serv
ing the University. R. L. S.
