# Tuition But a Small Revenue to Colleges.
## 
### 
The support of institutions of learning
is a study by itself, '''he thoughtless
outsider might think that the $20, §00,
or 8100 tuition collected from each
student was sufficient to meet the nec
essary running expenses, but this idea
is badly shattered by President Coulter
of Lake Forest University, who, in a
recent address, presented the following
figures, which had been carefully col
lected:
Annual Expense Average
for each Student Equipment
over Receipts lor each
CoLJ-EtiES. from Students. Student.
Wesleyan $ 25!) $ 2187
Yale 231 1500
Evanston 105 635
Wabash 100 872
Amherst 175 1453
Harvard 305 2705
Williams 146 1410
Ann Arbor 300 1200
Minnesota 266 2480
Nebraska 160 813
Princeton 250 1800
Hamilton - 135 2000
Cornell 242 1210
Columbia 1400 4530
Wooster 50 350
Lafayette 60 2100
Brown 210 2630
Beloit 105 700
Wisconsin 400 2800
Lake Forest 92 678
The above figures show that even
that college man who prides himself on
paying all his college bills and takes no
"remitted tuition" or scholarships is
vet educated by charity and is a great
debtor to his Alma Mater. Aud he is
also a debtor in proportion to the size of
the institution which he attends.—New
York Commercial Advertiser.
