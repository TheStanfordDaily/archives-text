The '96 niue will try conclusions
with the invincible '95 team tomorrow
afternoon at 3:45. The most exciting
athletic event ever held on the oval was
the contest for supremacy between these
two teams a few days before last com

by a score of Bto 7. The juniors have
a far superior fielding team, but will
