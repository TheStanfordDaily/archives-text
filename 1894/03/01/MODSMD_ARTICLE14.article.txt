Berkeley has taken a stand in re
gard to athletics which is both unique
and uncollegiate. It seems that in
structions were given her tennis com
mittee recently not to come to any defi
nite understanding with a similar com
mittee from here until we should agree
to enter an intercollegiate field-day
That we Â«re given to avoiding inter
collegiate contests wheu we have any
men ahle to enter them has been very
satisfactorily disproved by our past
record.
It is a notorious fact that we have at
present no facilities for the training of
track athletes, our track being a
myth. Neither can we train a boat
crew. Nearly three miles of salt
sloughs and mud flats lie between us
and the bay, and our only home lake
is far too small Therefore we do not
pretend at present to boast of, or send
out, as representatives of this Univer
sity, a track athletic team or a boat
crew. Not that we have not the ma
terial, but that we have no way to pre
pare such material fora contest.
However, if the few here who by
previous trainiug are able to measure
their ability ean find means whereby
they may fit themselves fora field-day
we have no doubt that they will will

ingly furnish the 11. C the sole oppor
tunity of defeating us which she so
much craves.
On the other hand we see no reason
except the fear of defeat why the U. (\
should not he perfectly willing to meet
us in baseball, for in this blanch of ath
letics as well as football and tennis
neither university is crippled by lack of
training facilities. It is the same way
with oratory. We are willing to meet
Berkeley in any kind of an intercolleg
iate contest which common sense shows
to be within the roach of both univer
sities to furnish trained contestants for.
We mention the fact, of our holding
the interdf legiate championship in foot
ball, baseball* tennis, and oratory as
against the IJ. C.'s championship in
track ath'etics as an example of the
ability that lias manifested itself when
opportunities for training were within
reach.
