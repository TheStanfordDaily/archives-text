# Basket Ball.
## 
### 
The University basket ball team has
received a challenge from the Castilleja :
team to play a game of ball, time and
place to be arranged. It is necessary ,
for us to take prompt action. There
are two ways open to us: to refuse to
play because we have no University
team, in so doing acknowledging defeat
from them; or to elect a captain, organ
ize a regular University team, and
make our best effort to defeat them.
Much depends upon our action, as it is a
test of the ability of our association. To
consider this question, will all young
ladies interested in basket ball please
meet in lloble music room at 1:15 p.m.
