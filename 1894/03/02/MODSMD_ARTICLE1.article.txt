# ASSOCIATED STUDENTS.
## The
						Consideration of the Constitution Brings Out a Large Crowd. 
### 
As the time drew near for the studeut
body meeting yesterday afternoon a vast
crowd gathered about the doors of the
chapel, aud the numerous little groups
of students that were to be seeu on all
sides holding excited debates was only
a preliminary to the fight that was to
come. On account of the 2 p.m. lecture
the student body adjourned to the
chemical lecture room. Greatly to the
surprise of every one, over two hundred
and fifty students, over one-fourth of
whom were young ladies, went across
the quadrangle to the new place of
meeting. The accommodations of the
chemical room being very limited,
about fifty were c impelled to listen out
side the windows, and the standing room
was utilized; consequently the primitive
method of voting by a showing of hands
was found necessary.
Lewis, '95, vice-president of the as
sociation, called the meeting to order
and asked, as the first business on hand,
for reports of committees
The executive committee, through
its chairmin, Zion, then reported the
ratification of the constitution of
the Stanford Inter-society Debating
League, and the form ition of the pro
posed constitution which was printed in
the supplement to Wednesday's issue.
It was carried that the constitution be
considered article by article aud finally
adopted as a whole with the amend
ments.
The list cla ise of Article 11, Sec.
1, was aui'in led to read ' The other of
ficers may be elected fro-u any of the
undergraduate students "'
The extraordinary attendance of the
women was made obvious. They pro
posed an amendment whereby two
women should be elected on the Ath
letic Board and the Women's Athletic
Association recognized. After much
discussion of the matter by Misses
Kaves and Ilill, and Rice, the amend
ment was lost. An amendment was
carried which provided for the election
of an official baseball scorer by the ath
letic committee. An amendment was
then proposed providing that managers
of our University teams should be ex
officio members of the athletic com
mittee. After much discussion by
Zion, Bancroft, Bledsoe, and others, the
amendment was carried by a small vote.
The great question of the day, how
ever, was whether or not the athletic
managers should receive a proportional
part of all net profits derived from our
athletic contests. Many amendments
allowing various percentages were made
but the one by Sandwick to strike out
Sec. 9 of Art. II entirely was finally
carried. Zion, Rice, Storey, \Y oodward,
Collins, and others were in favor of al
lowing a percentage; Maynard, Calhoun,

and a score of others opposed it. After
deciding to accept the proposition <>l
the Ice Skating iiink Company, tlx*
meeting adjourned on account of the
'95-'96 baseball game.
