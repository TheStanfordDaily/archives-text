We would urge upon theO lass of 9G
the advisability of electing immediately
the editors of the next aunual. Too
much time cannot be given tor the ac
cumulation and collection of material
necessary fora successful annual. If
the boaru were elected right away its
members could take up the work in the
different departments . just where '95's
editors have left off, and thus the com
piling of records, events, and victories
could be made a less difficult task.
