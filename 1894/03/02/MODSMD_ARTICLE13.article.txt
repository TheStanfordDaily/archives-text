The baseball team which is to repre
sent our University this year promises
to be even better that last year's niuc
in fielding and base running, if the pre
liminary work counts for anything
With the strong individual players
among the candidates to be chosen from,
and the evident disposition of everyone
to accept every possible chance in field
ing, no matter how difficult it may be
nor how many errors are made, there
can be no doubt as to the efficiency of
the final team when it shall have had
its preliminary practice for team work.
In batting, however, the team is not up
to last year's form. A great deal
more individual attention must be given
this side of the work by the candidates
before a strong batting team can be
hoped for. I n eastern colleges the
most important feature of the daily
practice is the batting, the coaches de
voting more time to the development of
good bats-men than to good fielders.
We are fortunate this year in having
<>ood pitchers to practice on; therefore
it lies with the individual candidates
themselves how strong a batting team we
shall have this season. It is not likely
that theVarsitv will be weak in that re
spect if the men continue tl.eir interest
in the game.
