### 
The lecture of B. Nargarkar, a del
egate fro J) India to the World's Con
gress of Religions at Chicago, was given
yesterday afternoon before a crowded
chapel. In substance he spoke as fol
lows:
I propose this afternoon to give you
what I consider the traits, mental and
moral, of the Occident and the Orient.
In his scientific research and study
the Oriental native uses what is called
the intuitive process of investigation,
he closes his eyes to the outward in
fluences arid looks upon ocular phenom
ena as transient and in no way pei
ma' eut. On the other hand, the
native of the Occident has always made
reason his guide. His process has been
that of analysis In fact, intellectual
processes have been the most important
part in the researches and investiga
tions of western thought. The prin
cipal elements of Occidental science are
logic and rationality; of Oriental scieuce,
intuitive instincts and introspection.
The Occident looks upon life as a
struggle for existence. lie is obliged
to struggle, not only with the elemeuts
in nature, but with those amongst whom
he is born. The Orient, upon the other
hand, looks upon life as nothing but! the
preparation for the life]that is to come,
toe waiting room in a great station
where the arrival of that train that is to
carry us all is awaited. Thus the east
ern man is contemplative, meditative,
and emotional, while the western man
relies upou the logical, the scientific
basking in the moonshine of day,
husky logic, a stranger to the warmth
and depth of emotion.
The east and the west must meet
again and exchange the <;ood that each
possesses. The civilization of the future
must not be—it shall not be—purely
the one or the other, but pure reason
following upon the pure emotion of
heart and mind: the harmonizing of the
spirit of introspection with that of anal
ysis. The future civilization will be a
harmonious blending of the east and the
west. This is the great ideal that India
has placed before herself.
Let me designate the Occident by
reason and the Orient by faith; and
then I t me urge most strongly this
great idea of harmonizing reason and
faith—of blending the east and the
west.
A most marvelous work is being ac
complished by the Anglo Saxon race on
Indian soil. Seventy-five years ago
more than two hundred and seventy
five languages were spoken in India.
Today, under the new influence of the
English people, the English tongue has
blended all these vast and various na
tionalities of the Indian nation. Y T ou
may travel now from one end of the
country to the other and you will find
the people English-speaking and sym
pathetic.
I most humbly invite you to study
into our literature, our history, and cur
institutions, that your own lives may
harmonize with the great movement to
unite these two currents of human civ
ilization that have so long run each by
itself.
