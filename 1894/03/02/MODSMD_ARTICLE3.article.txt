# '96 WINS THE BALL GAME.
## 
### 
'95's Victorious Record of Three Years
Is Broken.
Over three hundr.d students stood
round the diamond late yesterday after
noon and went wild with enthusiasm over
the junior sophomore game and its
many humorous features The con
tinuous joshing of the '95 pitcher by
sophomore spectators produced the de
sired efl'ect upon his delivery, and h\s
case of "rattles" seemed to spread to
the whole '95 team, made up almost en
tirely of Varsity men.
To McLaine, the Varsity pitcher, is
due the credit of '96's victory; he struck
out twelve men, allowed but three scat
ter- d hits off his delivery, and did good
work with the stick. At the beginning
of the sixth inning the score stood 12
to 5 in favor of '90. then '95 managed
to hold her opponents down for two
innings wl ile she made five runs
Darknef-s ei di d the game with the
seventh inning. As an exhibition of
skillful ball playing and good team
work on the part of either nine the
game was a disappointment, otherwise it
was very interesting.
