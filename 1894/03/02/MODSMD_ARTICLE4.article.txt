# '96 Class Meeting.
## 
### 
The Class of '9(Â» met this afternoon
and after some debate decided to pub
lish an annual in conformity to custom.
The first step to this end was taken by
the choice of a committee of five whose
duty shall be to report to the class a
list of names of those best qualified to
carry on the work of publication.
From this list will be chosen the various
officers of the board.
The meeting was poorly attended,
hardly a quorum being present.
