Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In last Tuesday's Daily Palo Alto
there occurred the erroueous statement
that no one presented himself as a com
petitor from thfc students at large fora
place on the intercollegiate debate.
I wish to call your attention to
the fact that at the time and
place mentioned in the notices,
and in accordance with the con
stitution published in the Daily
Palo Ar/ro, I presented my name with
the above mentioned purpose in view.
