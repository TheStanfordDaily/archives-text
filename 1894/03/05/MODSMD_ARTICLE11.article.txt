## 
### 
lierkeley has taken no definite action
yet in regard to the Examiner prize
oratorical contest. The matter was be
fore the student, body last week and it
is expected that arrangements will be
made early this week. The Stanford
preliminaries will be held just before
the spring vacation; speeches will be
limited to fifteen minutes and the grad
ing system used in selecting the three
representatives for the intercollegiate
contest.. The latter will likely be held
about April 15 so as not to conflict with
Herkeley's final examinations. The
time is short. Six men have already
signified their intention to prepare for
the preliminaries.
