Every tennis player should try for
the teams which will represent Stan
ford in the intercollegiate tournamen s.
Three tournaments are scheduled, with
a team of four men for each one, giving
every man a chance to win a place on
one of the teams. The first tourna
ment will be held at Oakland or lierke
ley about March 31, the second on the
home courts iÂ»bout the first of May,
and the third on neutral grounds
Honest, continuous practice by a large
number of the tennis players will doubt
less result in the maintenance of their
past rccord.
