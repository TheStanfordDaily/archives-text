An impartial view of the coming
intercollegiate debate, which is to be
held before a larger cosmopolitan audi
ence probably than ever listened to a
similar contest, leads to a consideration

of our representatives. Twelve met)
from the three literary societies are
entered for the preliminary trial, and
of that number live are freshmen, three
are sophomores, and four are juniors.
The week's time limit in which a
candidate at large might disclose his
intention was not a sufficiently long
time, and the ruling of the president of
the Associated Students is that no such
rule shall obtain to the possible exclus
ion of anyone whose ability might win
the debate for Stanford and keep the
championship in the intercollegiate de
bate at Palo Alto.
It lias been suggested that the stud
ent body select four persons at large
who might meet some Tuesday evening
in place of the regular lecture and de
bate uuder the same regulations which
pertaiu to the inter-society contests.
In this way there would be sixteen
candidates instead of twelve to choose
from, and the studi ut body would then
feel that all the best material had been
brought out for this important contest.
