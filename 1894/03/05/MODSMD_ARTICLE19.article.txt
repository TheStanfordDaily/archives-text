The Founders' Day exercises, which
will be held in Kncina gymnasium next
Friday forenoon, beginning at a quarter
past ten o'clock, are intended primar
ily and solely tor the student commun
ity of Stanfordâ€”composed of the student
body and the members of the faculty
and their families. The day will not
be a holiday in the general acceptation
of that term, but will be the first ob
servance of an occasion in which the
whole student body has had an oppor
tunity to assemble in one place and bo
identified in connection with exercises
that are too close to the student heart
to be shared by the ever-present and
inquisitive public that has on all former
occasions mingled with the studeuts
until they were lost sight of in the
crowd. The lioanl of Regents will be
present and will then have their first
opportunity, as will every one else his,
of seeing the studeuts iu one body.
The program announced last week
has been further improved until it of
fers inducements to attendance upon
the exercises which no loyal aud grate
ful Stanford student would miss, par
ticularly as the exercises will be finished
by noon. Addresses will be made by
Benjamin Harrison. ex-President of the
United States; Horace Davis, ex presi
dent of the University of California; Hie
hop Iveaue, president of the Catholic
University at Washington, D. C.; and
by President Jordan. An orig
inal ode will be read by Prof. New
comer, and a musical program will be
furnished by the Glee Club and Prof.
Mary Smith.
Students will be given first consider
ation, and as the gymnasium is barely
large enough to accomodate the thous
and or more for whom the occassion
means the most the general public will
not be admitted.
