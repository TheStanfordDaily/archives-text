### 
Rev I)r. K. L. (laities, pastor of the
First Presbyterian church of Indiana
polis,delivered the sermon in the chapel
yesterday morning, of which a synopsis
is below:
"Gather a da)'s portion every day"—
Exodus xvi, 4.
The miracle of the manna told in this
chapter is also a parable, a picture of a
great truth, as true for us today as it
was for those Israelites in the desert of
Arabia thirty centuries ago. God is
educating us as he educated them.
Firht, to live by faith; second, to live
day by day.
This law of the manna was given also
as a test of obedience. The trial con
sisted in the restriction of the use of the
supply to the daily life. --. The man win#
has not learned the method of living

day by day has as yet to gain one secret
of true life.
The largest life is hut. a parcel of
days doied out a day at a time. The
only time we really can live is today.
Yesterday is no longer ours. 'I'otnor
row never conies. It is a will-'o-the
wisp; when we overtake it, behold! it
is another today, liememberiug and
anticipating are not living—they are
but dreaming of life. Forget the
things which are behind. If you pro
pose to tiyht your own battles, then L
must say frankly that 1 have no words
for you just now; but it you believe in
the great Redeemer then I say that
your yesterday < ught not to be allowed
to spoil your today.
Take heart with the day and begin
again. No man can gather euough to
day to give him a solid insurance policy
over the possibilities of tomorrow. In
some way many seem to think they
should look forward to happiness. Too
many spend their lives in getting ready
to be hanpy. Life is a present tense
affair. Someone has said there are four
kinds of people—those who are going
forward, those who are standing still,
those who are going backward, and
those who are getting ready to start in
some direction.
The future is unspeakably glorious
and solemn but the preseut is unspeak
ably significant because it is the foun
tain out of which the great river flows;
it. is the acorn out of which the giant
oak develops. •'The common deeds of
your common today art ringing bells
in the far away '' Our deeds of today
are forming our characters. What we
do today we are tomorrow.
