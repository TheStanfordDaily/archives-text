# The
						Glee Club Concert.

### 
The members of the Glee Club were
greeted by a very large audience on
last Friday evening. They sang four
numbers, each one of which was encored, j
The different vocal parts were evenly
balanced and the quality of tone was
good and full. Occasionally the at
tack was unity itself and the gradations j
of tone were generally nicely realized.
At times, however, the shading was;
lacking indelicacy, and in the last
number there was an inclination to has
ten the tempo.
The striug quartet played very
nicely. One of their numbers was a
charming little Gavotte, a Id antique '
full of the sweep of the minuet courtesy
and of the pathos of the by-gone time J
with its sweet refinement and glance of
sadness at the hurrying present.
Mr. Kennedy's voice was evidently
suffering from fatigue and consequently
was not heard to the best advantage.
This selection of Sullivan's charming
ballad "Let me dream again," which
he sang with much artistic skill, dis
played a refined taste.
Mr. Baker sang "Charmante Mar
guerite" with considerable stamina
Ilis voice was easily equal to all the de
mands made upon it by the song, which
is one of those ballads that possess a
comfortable familiarity with each other
which does not distinguish. His comic
songs gained him many recalls.
The selection of David's ,4 Ktude" by
Mr. Thomas was unfortunate. While
it served to display his command over
many of the points of virtuosity, it also
served to remind us that while the
French and Belgian school of techni
calities have led to a high grade of
execution they have also led away from
the true beauty and expressive power of
the noblest of instruments. Bich's
"Chaconne" teaches us the lesson that
technical difficulty is not incompatible
with musical ideas. David's '"Etude,"
on the contrary, shows us that it is
possible and even comparatively easy to
write music for the violin th.it is alto
gether lacking in musical thought.
Judged from the technical standpoint,
the work of Mr. Thomas was wellnigh
perfect; all the points of virtuosity,
with which the work fairly bristles,
were overcome in good style
More than a passing word <Â»112 praise is
due to Mr. Henry Harris, the accom
panist of the evening. His appreciation
and expression of the cdntibilv nature
of Sullivan's lyric was most commend
able. Edward Hulme.
