Every student iuterested in the
proper direction of student body affairs
should attend the meeting on Wednes
day. The constitution will then be
finally discussed. All should go with
a full understanding of the main point
of debate; a wordy meeting where those
competent to direct opinion are rarely
heard is no place to decide on the value
of any clause.
The main thing is to decide upon the
clause.relative to the payment of a foot
hall business manager. The clause was
rejected at the last meeting because the
proposed remuneration was thought toe
high, and not because it was the opinion
of the meeting that the business man
ager should receive no reward. Some
incentive must be given to a manager
to make profits; not au incentive to

reduce expenses, but to increase re
ceipts. Only by liberal and perhaps
lavish expenditure can the efficiency of
any team be maintained. A parsi
monious business manager initrht be
tempted to curtail expenses, to the det
riment of the team. This can be ob
viated by giviug the Executive Com
mittee power to authorize expenditures
thought necessary, leaving iti this way
only an incentive to increase receipts
and to dispeuse with needless outlay.
The general sentiment appears to be
in favor of allowing the business man
ager a commission of twenty-five per
cent, of the uet profits as a maximum.
This is not exorbitant by any means,
and would undoubtedly be tempting
enough to encourage in the future a
judicious outlay for necessaries, and a
retrenchment in the way of traveling
expenses and hotel bills.
