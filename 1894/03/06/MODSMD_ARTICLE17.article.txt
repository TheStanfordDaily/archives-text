# Prof. Harrison's First Lecture.
## 
### 
Over four hundred students besides
the faculty heard the first lecture in
the course on Constitutional Law. The
lecture lasted for an hour and was de
livered in a strong voice and scholarly
manner. The Daily Palo Alto will
probably not publish these lectures, as
owing to their repetitiou on the follow
ing day, everyone desirous of hearing
them will have had the opportunity.
iMore than this, if they were published
after being given for the first time,
much of their interest would be gone
tor those that hear them on the second
day.
There were seven shorthand reporters
present today. Notwithstanding that
Dr. Jordan announced that the lecture
as a whole would appear in the city
papers after tomorrow's lecture, the
reporters took verbatim notes.
