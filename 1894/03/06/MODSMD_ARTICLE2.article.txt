Editor Daily Palo Alto:
My so-called ruling regarding the
intercollegiate debate which appeared in
Monday's issue was simply my private
opinion. That I was justified is shown
by the concurrence of the executive
committee of the Stanford-U. C. Debat
ing League. E. It. Zion.

Editor Daily Palo Ai/ro:
Last evening's Daily Palo Alto
contained an editorial which stated that
the week's time limit in which a candi
date at large might disclose his inten
tion to compete fora place on the inter
collegiate debate was not sufficiently
long. We think it was. The inter
collegiate debate comes off about April
20. The last intersociety debate will
be held March 17. This will give our
debaters but a month to prepare for the
intercollegiate. The third debate would
have to come before March 17. Now
the time limit which has been objected
to was February 27. Had any debaters
then appeared thty would have had less
than three weeks to choose a question
and prepare for the preliminary debate.
Had the committee placed the time
limit after February 27 it would have
handicapped any possible contestants
and done them a great injustice.
The ruling of the president of the
Associated Students, that no such rule
obtain to the exclusion of anyone whose
ability might win the debate for Stan
ford, speaks more for his patriotism
than for his knowledge of the constitu
tion he has been chosen to enforce. It
distinctly states that any organization
intending to represent the University in
any field of activity shall be authorized
and mantained by the association upon
the adoption of a constitution a
ratified by the Executive Committee.
The Stanford Debating League,then-fore,
has exclusive control of Stanford repre
sentation upon the coming debate. It
has given non-society men a chance to
compete. For the president to attempt
to "rule" the debate out of the control
of the Debating League and into his
own is to override the constitution and
to assume dictatorship. C.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Some time ago the three debating
societies decided to form an intersociety
league for the purpose of holding a ser
ies of public debates, by means of which
the inter-collegiate debaters could be
sele", ed by a committee of the faculty.
To this end three men were elected
from each society as a committee to
draft a constitution for the proposed
league They drew up a constitution,
adopted it, had it ratified by the execu
tive committee of the Associated Stud
ents, and declared it "therefore in ef
fect," without even submitting it to the
league, which is to be governed by it.
Moreover they appointed themselves
the executive committee of the league
and elected two of their number as
members of the Stanford representation
on the executive committee of the Inter
collegiate Debating League.
Many of the members of this self
appointed executive committee are to
compete in the coming debates fora
place on the intercollegiate debate; and
it is evident why; when I presented my

self as a contestant, I was met with the
objection that it was too late to admit of
more debaters and that, according to a
part of the proposed constitution which
was not published, I was not eligible.
Should not a deliberative body have
something to say about the constitution
by which it is to be governed? And
should the committee that has the
management of the preliminary debates
be composed largely of the debaters
themselves? And, again, should not
the contests fora place on the inter
collegiate debate be open for any com-!
petitor who wishes to present himself,
just as it is in intercollegiate baseball,;
football, or tennis? There has been no
meeting of the league and therefore no
opportunity of discussing the proposed
constitution by the members. J. A. Gr. j
