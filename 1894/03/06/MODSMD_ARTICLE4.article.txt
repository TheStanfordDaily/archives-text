### 
The last meeting of Euphronia was
devoted to impromptu speeches and an
extempore debate. Merrill delivered a
speech upon "The ascent of Mt. Vesuv
ius"; Colliver upon "The climbing of
Black Mountain." Everyone present
took part in an extempore debate upon
the question, "Resolved, That the wo
men should be given representation
upon the Athletic Board." The soci
ety decided in favor of the affirmative.
