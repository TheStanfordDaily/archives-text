# PROF. SANFORD'S LECTURE.
## Rain Making ; It Is a Myth. 
### 
After explaining the scientific prin
ciples involved in the condensation of
atmospheric vapor, the professor cited
the following conditions as necessary
for the precipitation of rain:
(1) The air must contain enough
molecules of water vapor to more than
saturate it, and at the same time must
contain either solid or liquid bodies
upon which these vapor molecules
may be helu fast by cohesion.
(2) The air which does not contain
enough water vapor to saturate it may
come in contact with solid or liquid
substances which combine with or dis
solve the water molecules
Early experiments in rain making
have shown that vapor condensation
within the body of the air only takes
place upon the surface of dust particles
floating in the air. Indeed, Robert
von Helmholtz found that when the air
was carefully freed from dust particles
it could be cooled until it contained ten
times the vapor necessary to saturate it
without any vapor condensation taking
place in the air.
Rain makers have worked upon the
hypothesis of sudden condensation by
means of shocks, but so far as I am
aware no enterprising rain maker has
yet proposed a method of increasing the
total moisture of the air to any appre
ciable extent. They assert that if a
little coudensati 11 could be started in
one place it would at once spread out in
all direction*. IluW a rainfall, started
in this way, is ever to stop as long as
any aqueous vapor remains in the air
they have not condescended to tell us.
As a matter of fact th.-re is no evidence
to show that even the smallest local
shower has been produced artificially.
That some of the men who advocate
these wild schemes are honest in their
motives cannot be questioned, but that
all the professional rain makers are con
scienceless fakirs is scarcely more ques
tionable.
A clipping from the Exam
iner of February Li. 1 SO4-, was then
r a ad giving an account of the ' highly
successful experiments of the Visalia
rain maker,'' one Frank Baker The
weather bureau reports for that date
were examined and it was found that
thirty-six hours before Mr. Hague had
predicted rain for I'ixly, where "tho
Raker process" had caused ''drenching
downpours."
Several methods of rain making were
described, the most original and curious
of which was the following: One of
Mr. Aitkin's plans is to hold a great,
canvass sheet properly strengthened by
netting across the path of the advancing
wind, thus deflecting the wind upwards
like a range of mountains. lie esti
mated that a sheet 200x401) feet would
deflect upwards over four billion euhie
feet of air an hour if the wind were
moving ten miles an hour, lie has ap
parently neglected to calculate that a
sheet of this size would have to support
a pressure of 100,000 tons. When one
considers the balloon displacement nec
essary to suppott, a pull of this magni
tude, and then reflects that such a sheet
would b' about as effective for produc
ing upward currents as the Auditorium
in Chicago, he will conclude that it will
be cheaper to build a mountain ranjie
than it would to put up a canvas sail
large enough to have any effect upon
precipitation.
It is only surprising that the number
of these impostors is not larger The

business offers a special inducement to
men who are accustomed to make a
living by swindling their fellow men.
No capital and no business training is
required. Their systems have all the
advantages of the traditional gun loaded
to kill if it is a deer but to miss it it is
a calf.
