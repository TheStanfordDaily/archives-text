Cross country running has hitherto
proved a failure in Stanford, because
there was no preliminary training for it.
A tew of the best men have always set
a stiff pace and thereby exhausted the
novices.
Hare and hound runs a r e not sport
unless a large number take part in
them. Hut the softer men must be
gradually hardened before they can
endure the strain of such a competition.
This is the object proposed by Mr.
IJetherington of the physical training
department. It is certainly desirable
that the plan should succeed.
