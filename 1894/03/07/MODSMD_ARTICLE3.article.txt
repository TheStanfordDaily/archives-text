# Meeting of the Athletic Board.
## 
### 
The Board of Athletic Directors met
in room 90 Encina last evening to
transact all business to come before the
regular monthly meeting. Manager
Cox outlined the baseball situation, but
made no definite report, owing 10 the
incompletion of the Midwinter Fair
schedule of games. The tennis and
track committees gave reports on the
condition of affairs in their respective
departments. Track doiugs will remain
at a standstill until the committee can
devise means to raise money enough to
complete a straight-away track lor the
sprinters. Various schemes were pro
posed in this connection, but no definite
action was taken. Harry Cox was then
elected football manager, to hold office
for the ensuing year, receiving six votes
to Nicks, '00, four. Bumiller, '07, was
chosen to till the vacancy caused by
Thomas, '07, retiring from the Uni
versity.
