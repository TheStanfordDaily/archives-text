# Cross Country Runs.
## 
### 
Saturday morning at 0:45 about a
dozen men met in the gymnasium to
talk over plans for cross country ruu
ning. The plan agreed upon is that,
fora time, moderate runs shall be
taken, gradually increasing in distance
and speed Hetherington, '05, will de
cide upon the distances and set the
pace. After the men are sufficiently
hardened, hare and hound runs will be
arranged.
The first run w.i«' made Saturday after
noon. Fourteen men, with Hethering
ton in the lead, ran out across the fields
to the trotting farm, through its drives
to the Searsville road, back on it to the
branch leading into the "row," and
through it buck to the gymnasium—a
distance of about two miles. The next
run will start from the gymnasium
next Saturday morning at 0. The
hour fora mid-week run will be de
cided upon at that time also, as it is
the plan to make two runs a week.
