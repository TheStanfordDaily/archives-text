# REV. MR. GUNSAULUS'S LECTURE
## An Eloquent Address Delivered by the President of Armour Institute. 
### 
Rev. Mr. Gunsaulus was bom iu
Centreville, Ohio, thirty-eight years
ago. After graduating froui Ohio Wes
ley an University lie went to Columbus,
Ohio, then to West Newton, Mass., at
both ol which places he occupied the
pulpit of the Congregational church.
Several years ago lie was called to the
Plymouth Church, Chicago, which pos
ition he still occupies; while a little
over a year ago he was made president
of the Anuour Institute at Chicago.
Mr. Gunsaulus is married and has five
children.
Kefore hall past eleven, the hour for
the morning lecture, the chapel was
packed to the walls, and further en
trance had to be gained through the
windows, the very sills of whic'a were
soon occupied by those who wished to
be within seeing and hearing range of
the speaker. It seemed that all the
University was present, t>ut classes
were going on as usual j in many of the
recitation rooms. Prof. Stillmau struck
the chord of good feeling at o ice by
introducing the lecturer with the re
mark, "I am sorry there are not more ol
us here."
The lecture, a part of which is print
ed bolow. though extemporaneous was
probably the most eloquent address ever
delivered here.
The few brief, joking introductory
remarks of the speaker gained from his
audience a sympathy and attention
which his every sentence maintained
for an hour.
It, reminds me very much of the man
who had been drinking too much, and
who coming horn-! ran into a tree in
front of bis house. Backing away he
tried it again at another augie, only to
strike the same tree again. \\ hen he
had skinned his and barked his
shins, as we say in the barbarous east,
two or three times, he sat down on the
pavement in front of his house, and
wiping his bleeding face, exclaimed,
"host' Lost in an impenetrable forest!"
Senator Stanford was a man who saw
the immense influences upon the souls
of men by all that God has done in the
sky above, in the sea that, throbs against
our coasts, in the wierd tracery of the
clouds, in the storm music of the wind;
and I never knew a more poetic moment
than that in which he summarized all
that man might do through learning and
through the inspiration of great
thoughts. When the Armour Institute
became a living dream I am thankful
to say that the only man whose broad
ideas were ever present before its
founder, was Leland Stanford. Both
of these men were fond of the inspiring
thought of "partnership" Musincss
ideas are nowhere so practical and ideal
as when in partnership with jrreat ideas
that increase with the human wealth
they observe and with the constant
growth of the richness of man's life.
Perhaps some of you are regretting
that you have come here from the Kast
instead of going to Vale, Harvard, or
Princeton, with their background of
two hundred years or more. The ideal
scholar is the man who appeals to the
ancientness of the soul itself; who be

lieves that nature has so much to chron
icle of Gods's law and purpose, that all
her corrollaries and all her mysteries are
far more to be revered than the utter
ances of any past.
Here in California her wonders and
possibilities express themselves to your
imagination as almost nowhere else in
the world, and no antiquity in any
American past is so to be reverenced as
the human soul that underlies every
building; that is the real valuation be
hind every archway. No scholar rev
erences any past that is not as ancient
as the soul ot humanity. The men who
have really done the world the greatest
services by their scholarship are men
who have constantly appealed from some
little eddj into which the world was
rapidly running out into some slow,
broad, steady stre im flowing onward
towards an ocean whose name we do not
know. Here in the midst of all tint is
splendid in nature your first work
should be to find the human soul, and
know that beneath everything that
charms in the great traffic and business
of the world there is one thing that
must be reckoned as perpetual—the
human soul. John Milton gave to man
as the perfect thought of the greatest
scholar: the man who finds beneath
all things the soul of nature.
The world of tomorrow waits for the
American scholar Everywhere man
waits to be re-ensouled. May God
grant that from this University, where
the traditions from the past are all
spiritual and intellectual, where nature
conspires to make you thoughtful, there
may come forth fearless, earnest, large
souled scholars.
1 have felt all along that everything
I have said attaches itself closely to this
meat book [placing his band upon the
bible] and its wonderful teachings.
Scholarship itself must ask this book to
stand all the influences of the storm of
shame that comes in the varied study
of nature and the soul of man. Kvery
truth that is recorded in ibis book will
so easily outgrow all times that neither
you nor I need worry about its future.
The whole purpose of education, so
far as the universe educates man. is to
educate him entirely, simultaneously, to
make him a man indeed in such a uni
verse as this. God grant that whatso
ever you may do in science, mechat.ics,
or literature, there may be that stimu
lant of the imagination in the very
drops of blood that shall make your
life poetic and true because your educa
tion was r«"eived here in this broad
land, where there arc such grand oppor
tunities for broad reasoning. In spite
ot all we may say the city is the ulti
mate thing toward which civilization
tends, but no man reasons accurately
who does not, take into account, the
unity of the sky and the glory of the
earth as she reveals herself in country
life.
The Greek language is one of the
greatest achievements of the human
mind. Latin was the language of
Home —Home was the land of the
human intellect and will. The roads
t l >at r,m to llotne led to a superb civ
ilization centred in magnificent will.
Jerusalem was the city of the human
heart: and so we have these three lan
iruages, the Latin, the Greek, and the
Hebrew, representing respectively the
human will, the intellect, and the
heart—all inscribed on the crucifixial
cross.
And now, my young friends, ns T look
out, over the volume of intellectual
power here congregated, the immense
and growing will that is yet to sway
civilization, I feci that it is not by be
ing emotional, or thoughtful, but by

combining these into one rounded per
sonality are you to be women and men
of the noblest sort. And I commend
you to that ideal of life that draws all
of you with His sublime commandments
into great promises and sources of per
fect manhood and womanhood.
