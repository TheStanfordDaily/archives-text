A recent plan in regard to home
games adopted by the baseball manage
ment is a good one A series of six or
eight games will be played on the
campus during the next two months to
which an admission fee of twenty-five
cents will be charged. Untransferable
season tickets, costing one dollar, will
also be on sale. This new order of
thing 3 will put the baseball busiueas in
a better condition, will obviate the
necessity for another subscription fund,
and at the same time can cause no great
inconvenience to anyone. The price of
admission is small and the games, which
will be between the best amateur teams
on the coast, will be worth seeing.
