# No Football Between Annapolis and West Point.
## 
### 
There will be no more football
matches between the military cadets at
West Point and the naval cadets at
Annapolis. Ever since the great game at
Annapolis last fall the secretary of the
navy and the secretary of war have been
considering the advisability of allowing
these annual military-naval matches to
coutiuue, and iu order to help them in
deciding the matter reports were called
for from the superintendents of the two
academies. These reports were received
receutly, and the superintendents agreed
that while football was a good thing
for the cadets on their own grounds,
trips to other places to play teams there
seriously interfered with study and
discipline.â€”Crimson.
