# "THE STANFORD QUAD,"
## What It Will Contain. 
### 
"The Stanford Quad" will be ready
for distribution about May 1. It will
be a book of 250 to 300 pages, printed
on heavy, coated paper. The work will
be done by the 11. S. Crocker Co. of
San Francisco, in their best style, and
will contain photo, steel, and line en
gravings of the faculty, buildings and
g ounds. ot athietic, musical, social,
class, literary, fraternal, and educa
tional organizations, and of jokes, intro
ductories, and so forth. It will also
have complete statistics of all organiza
tions, original poems, short stories of
University life, jokes, and much more
interesting matter that cannot be class
ified; thus making it a valuable refer
ence book and handsome souvenir of
the University. The cover, which was
designed by Roy Ely, '96, has been
pronounced by those who have seen it
and are capable of judging, as being
one of the most artistic covers of any
annual in the United States.
The management has been hoping
that it would be able to sell the annual
at one dollar per copy, but owing to the
hard year aud the fact that many
advertisers, the men on whom reliance
was placed for financial support, refuse
to advertise, it is necessary that, the
price be increased to 51.50, which is
fully SI less than cost price. Again,
this advanced price is brought about
partly by the fact that the management
had to figure on uncertainties, without
any precedent to guide them.
In order to guard against loss by
having too many copies printed, it will
be sold by subscription. It is hoped
that every professor and student will
aid and encourage the management and
the Class of '9 by taking at least one
copy of the first Stanford annual. Sub
scriptions will be in charge of the bus
iness manager, N. G. Buxton, and his
assistants, E M. Rea, W. E. Stuart,
and 11. A. Soper. It will be necessary
to give one of them your name and get
a check in order to secure a copy, as
only so many will be printed as pros
pects seem to warrant.
