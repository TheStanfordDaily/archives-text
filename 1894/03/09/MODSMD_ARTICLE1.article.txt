# FOUNDERS' DAY.
## The
						First Memorial Exercises Held at the University. 
### 
A Fitting Program Listened To by the
Whole Stanford Community.
The shower during the night wan
over, and the day which was to mark
the first general participation of the
Stanford community in a tribute to the
founder of the University broke fresh
and clear upon the broad aud verdant
Santa Clara valley, dotted with the
darker green of the oak, and sheltered,
to the east and to the west by parallel
divisions of the picturesque Coast
Range. White clouds floating over the
wooded mountain tops to the seaward
lent, an additional charm to the sur
roundings that have made the location
of the University lamous.
From all directions groups of stu
dents turned their faces towards the
scene of the morning's exercises, and
sometime before ten o'clock Fncina
gymnasium was filled to its utmost seat
ing ijapacity; but the crowd continued to
increase until when the exercises began
there wore about ten hundred and fiftj
persons present, fully a third of whom
were women Then, for the first time
in the short history of the Univeisity,
was gathered together the community
which forms its life.
At one end of the gymnasium was a
raised platform upon which the
speakers and the trustees were seated,
and at the back of the platform were
hung a life size portrait of Iceland
Stanford, Jr., and a smaller one of Sen
ator Stanford, while overhead were
draped three large American fl >gs.
On all sides and almost covering the
walls oi the building were decorations
of palm leaves, bamboo branches, and
other evergreens.
The seats near the platform were oc
cupied by members of the faculty and
by Mrs. Stanford, who took her place
amid prolonged applause. Those who
furnished the program were introduced
by President Jordan.
The opening musical selection, "Even
ing Prayer," was beautifully rendered
by the Stanford String Quartet, com
posed of Thomas, first violin; Chase,
second violin; Stratton, viola; and C.
Magee, violincello. Then followed a
prayer by Prof. A. B. Show; after
which the memorial ode was read by
Prof. A. <>. Newcomer. Following
this came an address delivered by Hon.
Horace Davis; a vocal solo by P of
Mary Roberts Smith, 'What are these!
that are arrayed;"' In placeof the expec
ted address by liishop Keane, who sent a
note in which he expressed regret that
he could not take part in the exercises,!
Prof. Murray read extracts from
speeches recently delivered in Congress
on the occasion of memorial exercises in i
houor of Senator Stanford. Dr. Jordan
interposed a few remarks, which are

elsewhere quoted; then ex-President
Harrison spoke. "Our Days on Earth"
by the Glee Club, followed by the bene
diction by Hon. Horatio Stebbius,
closed the program.
Hon. Horace Davis's Address.
It is a happy suggestion to set apart
one day in the year to commemorate
ihe wisdom and generosity of the
founders of this great institution.
One living example of public spirit
like this is worth a library of sermons
As Governor Stanford Maid in his ad
dress on the opening day of the Uni
versity, speaking of the influence of the
teacher upon the student, "by precept
the road is long, but short and sure by
example."
Action is worth more than precept.
Life moves more than philosophy, and
every generous act repeats itself on a
larger or smaller scale, as the case may
be; and the world profits by the lives of
its heroes long after they have passed
away.
But I do not stand here to eulogize
these noble gifts. Their monument is
around you. Their worth has been ex
pressed by better tongues than mine.
I would rather devote the time al
lotted me to the leading incidents of
Governor Stanford's public life as illus
trating the expressed inteution of this
noble endowment.
His genius was a practical one, and
found its expression in deeds rather
than in words. For over thirty years
he was the most conspicuous figure in
the history of the tate, and he has
definitely impressed his influence upon
its history.
It was his good fortune to be made
governor of California in 1861, at the
most critical period of her history.
Those were indeed trying times. The
bloody struggle betwoen the North and
the South had already begun. The fed
eral troops had already met with disaster
at Hull Run. A large part of the
people of California came from the
states then in rebellion, and sympathized
with the Confederacy. Other leading
citizens openly favored the establish
ment of a Pacific Republic. In this
turmoil of opinion friend was arrayed
against friend, neighbor against neigh
bor. Intense passion was aroused on
either side, and we felt we were living
over a living volcano, which might
break out any day and engulf us in the
horrors of civil war on California soil.
The firm hand, the cool judgment, and
the execu.ive ability of the Governor
contributed largely to avert these
dangers, brought out the uuiou scnti
meut, saved us from civil war at our
very doors, and saved California to the
Union. From a condition of doubtful
loyalty she became a firm bulwark of
the federal government. Her gold,
flowing into the coffers of the treasury,
strengthened the arms of the central
government and her generous contribu
tions to the Sanitary Commission gave
cheer and comfort to the wounded sol
dier.

(Jut of the experience of these try
ing years grew a sense of the priceless
value of powerful, stable government,
and the duty of unswerving loyalty aud
good citizenship on the part of every
thinking man, a sentiment which is re
flected in that section of the Univer
sity charter which defines as one of its
purposes "to teach the blessings of lib
erty regulated by law, and to inculcate
love and reverence for the great princi
ples of the government"
At the close of his lerm of office he
threw his whole heart into the building
of the overland railway; speedy
completion , in the face of discourage
ments and difficulties of the most
formidable character, was due in great
degree to his energy and executive
power. In May, 1869, with due cere
mony, the last spike was driven and the
great chain of rails was completed, bind
ing the Atlantic to the Pacific By
this act California entered upon a new
era of history. Up to 1869 she had
been separated from her sister states by
a twenty-five day ocean voyage and a
transit of foreign territory. Now she
could reach the national capital in a
week's journey over our own soil, and
the Pacific Coast became, for the first
time in its history, practically an inte
gral part of the territory of our country.
I lay stress on these periods of the
state because they were the two decis
ive points which controlled her future,
and in each scene Governor Stanford
was the principal actor and his prac
tical genius mainly shaped the result.
After that memorable day at Prom
ontory, his life for many years was de
voted to developing the system of
transportation made necessary by the
overland road.
If his day had closed there he would
have been gratefully remembered for
these eminent services. But its set
ting was clouded by a bereavement
bringing unspeakable grief to his h me.
In the providence of God this deep
sorrow which fell upon his house was
transmitted into inestimable riches for
us; out of the desolation of their owu
home came the resolve of the founders
to consecrate this vast endowment
to the benefit and blessing of the
young. I shall never forget that day in
November, 1885, when this great trust
was consummated and the deed actually
delivered to the trustees. We had been
invited to meet the Governor and Mrs.
Stanford at their home in San Fran
cisco. They received us in the library
without pomp or parade; the trustees
were all present except Judge Field
and Judge Deady, who were delayed by
official duties; there were present also a
few of the Governor's official household
The grant of endowment was read.
Governor Stanford followed its reading
with a brief address, explaining their
purposes in the grant. Mrs. Stanford
expressed her cordial sympathy with
the plan. The deed was formally de
livered to the trustees, who subscribed
to their acceptance of the solemn duty—
and the University was founded.

I have witnessed many solemn cere
monies and pageantN in my life, but no
event is more deeply engraved on my
memory than that simple tranßfer. Two
j, ears later I was present at the laying
of the corner stone, and again in 1891
at the ceremonies of opening day, but
neither of these days impressed me like
that quiet scene in Governor Stanford's
library.
When I came to read over the grant
of endowment by myself I was struck
with some of its provisions which
seemed to regard the higher education
in a somewhat different light from what
I had been used to. In the charter the
purpose of the University is stated to
be the promotion of the public welfare.
The education itself shall be conducted
with a view to the general good. We
have long recognized this principle in
the public schools, that they have no
reason for being except as they contrib
ute to the general welfare, and espec
ially as they make good citizens; but
here is a new deoarture in scholastic
affairs.
"Its purpose," says the grant, "shall
be to promote the public welfare, by
exercising an influence in behalf of
humanity and civilization, teaching the
blessings of liberty regulated by law,
and inculcnting love and reverence for
the great principles of government as
derived from the inalienable rights of
man to life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness. Its object is to qualify stu
dents for personal success and direct
usefulness in life"; whilst its nature
and scope 8 l )all be those of a "Univer
sity of the highest grade."
1 am not going to discuss the methods
of carrying out these propositions.
They are in the hands of persons of
mature wisdom and educational exper
ience. They need no eulogy from me.
The wonderful success of the Univer
sity in its very infancy is in itself a vin
dication of their policy. Hut I would
call your attention fora few moments
to the "object" of the University, as
stated above: "To qualify students for
personal success and direct usefulness
in life." This idea is again defined in
the duties of the trustees "to fit the
graduate for some useful pursuit."
The central purpose of the endow
ment is to make good citizens. To this
end, whether men or women, they
must have a distinct vocation for which
the}* will need a technical training.
Second, they must be thoroughly
grounded in the principles of our gov
ernment, and in the rights and duties
attaching to all good citizenship.
Third, to all this is added a reverent
attitude towards the Almighty Ruler,
who is the author of all good, and the
sustainer of the universe.
I know of no educational endow
ment laid on a broader and more gen
erous basis than this. It knows neither
sex, creed, nor social distinction.
And here let me call to your minds
an interesting fact, that the first
scholarship ever endowed in America,
was the gift of a woman: Lady Ann
