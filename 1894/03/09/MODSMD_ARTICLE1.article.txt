# FOUNDERS' DAY.
## The 						First Memorial Exercises Held at the University. 
### 
A Fitting Program Listened To by the
Whole Stanford Community.
The shower during the night wan
over, and the day which was to mark
the first general participation of the
Stanford community in a tribute to the
founder of the University broke fresh
and clear upon the broad aud verdant
Santa Clara valley, dotted with the
darker green of the oak, and sheltered,
to the east and to the west by parallel
divisions of the picturesque Coast
Range. White clouds floating over the
wooded mountain tops to the seaward
lent, an additional charm to the sur
roundings that have made the location
of the University lamous.
From all directions groups of stu
dents turned their faces towards the
scene of the morning's exercises, and
sometime before ten o'clock Fncina
gymnasium was filled to its utmost seat
ing ijapacity; but the crowd continued to
increase until when the exercises began
there wore about ten hundred and fiftj
persons present, fully a third of whom
were women Then, for the first time
in the short history of the Univeisity,
was gathered together the community
which forms its life.
At one end of the gymnasium was a
raised platform upon which the
speakers and the trustees were seated,
and at the back of the platform were
hung a life size portrait of Iceland
Stanford, Jr., and a smaller one of Sen
ator Stanford, while overhead were
draped three large American fl >gs.
On all sides and almost covering the
walls oi the building were decorations
of palm leaves, bamboo branches, and
other evergreens.
The seats near the platform were oc
cupied by members of the faculty and
by Mrs. Stanford, who took her place
amid prolonged applause. Those who
furnished the program were introduced
by President Jordan.
The opening musical selection, "Even
ing Prayer," was beautifully rendered
by the Stanford String Quartet, com
posed of Thomas, first violin; Chase,
second violin; Stratton, viola; and C.
Magee, violincello. Then followed a
prayer by Prof. A. B. Show; after
which the memorial ode was read by
Prof. A. <>. Newcomer. Following
this came an address delivered by Hon.
Horace Davis; a vocal solo by P of
Mary Roberts Smith, 'What are these!
that are arrayed;"' In placeof the expec
ted address by liishop Keane, who sent a
note in which he expressed regret that
he could not take part in the exercises,!
Prof. Murray read extracts from
speeches recently delivered in Congress
on the occasion of memorial exercises in i
houor of Senator Stanford. Dr. Jordan
interposed a few remarks, which are

elsewhere quoted; then ex-President
Harrison spoke. "Our Days on Earth"
by the Glee Club, followed by the bene
diction by Hon. Horatio Stebbius,
closed the program.
Hon. Horace Davis's Address.
It is a happy suggestion to set apart
one day in the year to commemorate
ihe wisdom and generosity of the
founders of this great institution.
One living example of public spirit
like this is worth a library of sermons
As Governor Stanford Maid in his ad
dress on the opening day of the Uni
versity, speaking of the influence of the
teacher upon the student, "by precept
the road is long, but short and sure by
example."
Action is worth more than precept.
Life moves more than philosophy, and
every generous act repeats itself on a
larger or smaller scale, as the case may
be; and the world profits by the lives of
its heroes long after they have passed
away.
But I do not stand here to eulogize
these noble gifts. Their monument is
around you. Their worth has been ex
pressed by better tongues than mine.
I would rather devote the time al
lotted me to the leading incidents of
Governor Stanford's public life as illus
trating the expressed inteution of this
noble endowment.
His genius was a practical one, and
found its expression in deeds rather
than in words. For over thirty years
he was the most conspicuous figure in
the history of the tate, and he has
definitely impressed his influence upon
its history.
It was his good fortune to be made
governor of California in 1861, at the
most critical period of her history.
Those were indeed trying times. The
bloody struggle betwoen the North and
the South had already begun. The fed
eral troops had already met with disaster
at Hull Run. A large part of the
people of California came from the
states then in rebellion, and sympathized
with the Confederacy. Other leading
citizens openly favored the establish
ment of a Pacific Republic. In this
turmoil of opinion friend was arrayed
against friend, neighbor against neigh
bor. Intense passion was aroused on
either side, and we felt we were living
over a living volcano, which might
break out any day and engulf us in the
horrors of civil war on California soil.
The firm hand, the cool judgment, and
the execu.ive ability of the Governor
contributed largely to avert these
dangers, brought out the uuiou scnti
meut, saved us from civil war at our
very doors, and saved California to the
Union. From a condition of doubtful
loyalty she became a firm bulwark of
the federal government. Her gold,
flowing into the coffers of the treasury,
strengthened the arms of the central
government and her generous contribu
tions to the Sanitary Commission gave
cheer and comfort to the wounded sol
dier.

(Jut of the experience of these try
ing years grew a sense of the priceless
value of powerful, stable government,
and the duty of unswerving loyalty aud
good citizenship on the part of every
thinking man, a sentiment which is re
flected in that section of the Univer
sity charter which defines as one of its
purposes "to teach the blessings of lib
erty regulated by law, and to inculcate
love and reverence for the great princi
ples of the government"
At the close of his lerm of office he
threw his whole heart into the building
of the overland railway; speedy
completion , in the face of discourage
ments and difficulties of the most
formidable character, was due in great
degree to his energy and executive
power. In May, 1869, with due cere
mony, the last spike was driven and the
great chain of rails was completed, bind
ing the Atlantic to the Pacific By
this act California entered upon a new
era of history. Up to 1869 she had
been separated from her sister states by
a twenty-five day ocean voyage and a
transit of foreign territory. Now she
could reach the national capital in a
week's journey over our own soil, and
the Pacific Coast became, for the first
time in its history, practically an inte
gral part of the territory of our country.
I lay stress on these periods of the
state because they were the two decis
ive points which controlled her future,
and in each scene Governor Stanford
was the principal actor and his prac
tical genius mainly shaped the result.
After that memorable day at Prom
ontory, his life for many years was de
voted to developing the system of
transportation made necessary by the
overland road.
If his day had closed there he would
have been gratefully remembered for
these eminent services. But its set
ting was clouded by a bereavement
bringing unspeakable grief to his h me.
In the providence of God this deep
sorrow which fell upon his house was
transmitted into inestimable riches for
us; out of the desolation of their owu
home came the resolve of the founders
to consecrate this vast endowment
to the benefit and blessing of the
young. I shall never forget that day in
November, 1885, when this great trust
was consummated and the deed actually
delivered to the trustees. We had been
invited to meet the Governor and Mrs.
Stanford at their home in San Fran
cisco. They received us in the library
without pomp or parade; the trustees
were all present except Judge Field
and Judge Deady, who were delayed by
official duties; there were present also a
few of the Governor's official household
The grant of endowment was read.
Governor Stanford followed its reading
with a brief address, explaining their
purposes in the grant. Mrs. Stanford
expressed her cordial sympathy with
the plan. The deed was formally de
livered to the trustees, who subscribed
to their acceptance of the solemn duty—
and the University was founded.

I have witnessed many solemn cere
monies and pageantN in my life, but no
event is more deeply engraved on my
memory than that simple tranßfer. Two
j, ears later I was present at the laying
of the corner stone, and again in 1891
at the ceremonies of opening day, but
neither of these days impressed me like
that quiet scene in Governor Stanford's
library.
When I came to read over the grant
of endowment by myself I was struck
with some of its provisions which
seemed to regard the higher education
in a somewhat different light from what
I had been used to. In the charter the
purpose of the University is stated to
be the promotion of the public welfare.
The education itself shall be conducted
with a view to the general good. We
have long recognized this principle in
the public schools, that they have no
reason for being except as they contrib
ute to the general welfare, and espec
ially as they make good citizens; but
here is a new deoarture in scholastic
affairs.
"Its purpose," says the grant, "shall
be to promote the public welfare, by
exercising an influence in behalf of
humanity and civilization, teaching the
blessings of liberty regulated by law,
and inculcnting love and reverence for
the great principles of government as
derived from the inalienable rights of
man to life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness. Its object is to qualify stu
dents for personal success and direct
usefulness in life"; whilst its nature
and scope 8 l )all be those of a "Univer
sity of the highest grade."
1 am not going to discuss the methods
of carrying out these propositions.
They are in the hands of persons of
mature wisdom and educational exper
ience. They need no eulogy from me.
The wonderful success of the Univer
sity in its very infancy is in itself a vin
dication of their policy. Hut I would
call your attention fora few moments
to the "object" of the University, as
stated above: "To qualify students for
personal success and direct usefulness
in life." This idea is again defined in
the duties of the trustees "to fit the
graduate for some useful pursuit."
The central purpose of the endow
ment is to make good citizens. To this
end, whether men or women, they
must have a distinct vocation for which
the}* will need a technical training.
Second, they must be thoroughly
grounded in the principles of our gov
ernment, and in the rights and duties
attaching to all good citizenship.
Third, to all this is added a reverent
attitude towards the Almighty Ruler,
who is the author of all good, and the
sustainer of the universe.
I know of no educational endow
ment laid on a broader and more gen
erous basis than this. It knows neither
sex, creed, nor social distinction.
And here let me call to your minds
an interesting fact, that the first
scholarship ever endowed in America,
was the gift of a woman: Lady Ann
Mulson of London, in 1043, gave Har
vard College one hundred pounds
fora scholarship. It is a happy
incident of this occasion that the en
dowment of this University, the high
est siugle gift for educational purposes
ever made in our country, conceived on
the broadest aud most liberal basis,
should be shared by a woman.
These then, are the purposes of the
founders, to make good citizens, trained
to a purpose iu life, with loyalty to the
country and reverence for God. The
idle man without a purpose is a leech
upon society, whether he be among the
gilded youth of the cities or the tramp
by the wayside.
And Governor Stanford says in one
of his addresses, that for this end there
cannot be too much educatiou. The
broader you lay the foundations of his
training the better man the student
will make.
This proposition will not meet with
universal acceptance. I have often
heard men say there is already too
much education; that the ranks of
workers are now too much depleted, with
out any adequate addition to the
thinkers and the leaders. Less than
two years ago I heard Andrew Carnegie
maintain that a college education was a
positive injury to a boy meaning to en
ter the practical walks of life. To
undertake an extended discussion of
this subject would be out of place to
day. To my judgment the position is
so plainly untenable it seems like
threshing over old straw; but I may be
pardoned one or two suggestions. The
argument generally assumes one of two
forms. Sometimes it is put thus: Vau
derbilt, and Jay Gould, aud Abraham
Lincoln, aud Kdisou, were self-made
men; began at the bottom and worked
their way up against obstacles. There
fore, every * boy should do the same.
The second form is this: I saw a Har
vard graduate collecting fares on a street
car—ergo a college education is useless
in practical life. Now I will admit
that a college training will not help you
to collect nickles on a horse car. I will
go further aud admit it is of no use in
some varieties of what we call business.
If you want to gamble on the stock ex
change or the call board your professors
can not teach you the principle?; nor
does the University develop the in
stinct of buying cheap and selling dear.
There is the breadth of the world
between the faculties of diftereut men.
Some are born for horse car conductors
and no culture could make them other
wise. Some of these enter college, aud
then they pass for cases of arrested de
velopment. They cannot grow because
there is nothing to grow. An apple seed
will never raise an oak. You can never
get any more out of a man than
there is in him and the man who sends
his boy to college thinking wisdom can
be pumped into him, by the professors
wastes his money and his hopes.
The reverse of this is true also.
Many a man is born with a genius for
some pursuit. Jay Gould by phenome
nal sharpness became a millionaire; Edi
son's brain teemed from childhood with
dreams of harnessing nature into a
thousand new forms of usefulness;
while Lincoln, with a sympathy and
wisdom that were above all teaching ex
cept that of experience, felt every beat
of the nation's heart, and guided her
through her mortal peril with a wisdom

that seems almost supernatural. Such
men are born with a capacity lor con
quest in their spheres.
I suppose a great deal of this preju
dice against higher education is a legacy
coming down from the time when
the colleges taught nothing but Greek,
Latin, and mathematics, lu those days
there was a wide gap betweeu academic
education and practical life; but now
there is no such divorce. More money
is spent today on scientific education
than upon classical, and there is hardly
a vocation iu life for which a boy may
not lay a fitting foundation in college;
and the better preparation he has the
more he can make of himself. The
college will not give him brains, but if
will show him how to use what uature
has provided.
The boy that goes into the shop may
have the start in the begiuning, but
culture will tell in the long ruu. 1
know of no more suggestive example of
the power of technical training than the
experience of our country in the war.
Men from all walks of life offered their
services to their country, many of
them men of distinction of whom
some rose to places of great re
sponsibility iu the army; but when the
war closed, those trusted with the high
est command on both sides were grad
uates of West Point. Grant, Sherman,
l-ee, Sheridan, Thomas—l need uot
extend the list—the technical training
won in the end.
A better test is to look over the list
of graduates ot such a school as the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
and see what uniform success has come
to them in after life.
There is a common prejudice that
college men take no interest in politics,
that such a training unfits a man for
political liie. If this were so, educa
tion does not make good citizens —but
it is not so. The recoids of Congress
show übout onefourth the members of
both Houses are college graduates, while
another fourth have received a partial
education in some college or professional
school. Now when we consider that in
1880 the whole number of college grad
uates, as near as could be
was less than one-seventeenth of the
adult male population, it amountsalniost
to an aristocracy if they hold onefourth
of the seats in Congress. To put it dif
ferently: the chances of any graduate of
this University becoming a congressman
or senator are eighteen-fold greater than
those of his brother who lud no college
training.
Hut there is something a man gains
by an academic training which is better
than what we ordinarily mean by "suc
cess," bitter than a seat in Con
gress, or even thau the riches of
Jay Gould. It is the atmosphere
of learning and letters which he
breathed in there; whose power, if he
have any affinity for culture, will in
spire his whole life. The true success
is to be measured by what a man is,
not by what he does; and the trained
mind, the love of learning, the society
of learning, the society of the best men
of all times, which a man gains by a
liberal education, ought to make a larger
aud a better man. Talk of the injury
a boy sustains by receiving an educa
tion. Did you ever know a college
graduate who was sorry he had been
educated? No. I would give a boy
all the university training he would

take. That is an inheritance he never
can lose, a fortune nobody cau rob him
of.
I have dwelt especially on the train
ing in practical things, because our
charter lays particular stress on the
ueed of this. Hut it goes farther aud
provides iu express terms for a "univer
sity of the highest grade," specifying
among other things, "museums, gal
leries of art, and the studies aud exer
cises directed to the cultivation and en
largement of the mind." Under these
are included departments ol philosophy
and classical learning, while the ripe
experience of the founders led them to
insist that iu the University should be
taught on the broadest uusectariau
grounds "the immortality of the soul,
the existence of an all-wise and benevo
lent Creator, aud that obedience to his
laws is the hignest duty of man." Poe
try, art, and religion, these arc the
bloom and aroma of our existence —
without them human life sinks to the
level of a mere machinc; the creaking of
the wheels drowns the mu.iic of the
spheres, and the dust of the highway
shuts out the light of the over-arching
sky.
I say to you as a practical man of
affairs immersed in business all my ma
ture years, these higher pursuits
1 have found cheer and comfort through
the trials of life. Do not neglect theui.
Cultivate the useful for your daily
bread, but cherish the beautiful for the
solace of your leisure hours. Cultivate
the practical, but uever loose your hold
on the spiritual. The University offers
you both. Indeed, it is the stamp of
the true university that it must include
iu its range all sides of human learning
and human experienc e
And when it shall close its doors
upon you, and you pa:?8 out upon the
threshold of active life, you will Com
plete the generous designs of the found
ers, filling your places iu the worid as
faithful workers, good citizens, noble,
wel'-balauced men and women, briug
ing satisfaction to yourselves and honor
to your Alma Mater.
Eulogies Read by Prof. Murray.
After reading Bishop Keane's note
of regret Dr. Jordau announced that
by request Prof. Murray would read
extracts from speeches delivered at the
recent Stauford memorial exercises iu
Congress. The extracts as read are
here given:
[Mr. Sibley of Pennsylvania.]
I shall not dwell upon his business
career, but in passing recount one inci
dent. Looking off to the great Sierra
Nevada range rising to the heavens as a
snow-whue, impenetrable barrier, he
told me the story of the building of the
Central Pacific road over their mighty
summits. He told me how, with three
other men, none of them rich, he would
meet at night and t. ilk about the neces
sity of something faster than a pony
express from the Missouri river to the
Pacific, and something pleasanter than
a stage coach and emigrant trail; aud
then how these four men, whose total
means were not adequate to build one
•single mile through some portions of
the mountaius, determined that they
would start the road and demonstrate to
the world the possibility of a railroad
over the Sierras. Krieuds laughed at
them, even jeered at them; entreated of
them not to hazard life's earnings in so
hazardous an enterprise. He told me
of the trials and discouragements, and
that for more than two yeais he did not
know whether he was worth millions or
poorer than a penniless beggar. Hut

the work went on to completion, aiul
what had been a dream yesterday wan
an accomplished fact today.
The building of the Central Pacific
railroad gives the clue to theVwhole life
of this man, whose projects were so
grand us to inspire doubts, yet wheu
tested found so practical as to utterly
dispel them, lie had laith in himself,
and what is so often lacking in great
minds, he had a most trustful faith iu
others.
One day at Palo Alto he showed me
the beautiful park in the centre of
which had been started the foundations
of a home.for his only son, who had
died some three years before. He told
me of the boy's character and his am
bitions for him; and then we went to
gether to the tomb of the boy, and he
told amid tears and sobs how since the
death of his son he had adopted and
taken to his heart and love every friend
less boy and girl in all the land; and
that so far as his means afforded, they
should go to make the path of every
such an one smoother and brighter; and
that with the increase in values of the
property giveu to the Leland Stanford
,Jr. University, he hoped that, it would
yet be able to feed, clothe, and educate
all the poor but aspiring youth of the
1'acific Slope.
One little digression here iu point.
My partner and my elf had purchased
a young colt of him, for which we paid
him SI'J.500. He took out his check
book, drew two checks of 86,250 each,
and seut them to two different city
homes for friendless children, and with
a twinkle in his eye, and broadly beam
ing benevolence in his features, said:
' Electric Hell ought to make a great
horse; he starts in making so uiauy
people happy in the very beginning of
his life.''
[Mr. Blair. |
Guided by an acute moral sense and
controlled by warm and generous sym
pathies, the deductions of his intellect
ripened into benovelence and compre
hensive action for the good of man upon
a scale which for maguitnde and pros
pective consequences s unsurpassed if
not unequalled in the whole history of
the race.
He was especially interested in pro
moting the welfare of the common peo
ple and uny measure which proposed to
increase their happiness at once com
manded his atteution and support.
J The laboring man had no wiser or truer
friend.
He was bom to conquer and to rule,
but his conquests cost no tear«, made
no slaves, marred no lands. He con
quered the obstacles of nature,
leveled mountains, filled valleys, an
nihilated distances, overcame time, wat
ered deserts and made them bloom He
| conquered greed and sordid self and
I made all that was his portion of each as
piring youth of the land. He con
quered poverty and lack of opportunity
for thousands living and thousands yet
unborn. He saw in every trieudless
boy a son.
[Mr. Wheeler of Alabama ]
It was his marvellous achievements
alone that s'amped him as great among
men; it was not that he was richest
anions his fellows and had millions of
money and great corporations under his
control The world respected and es
teemed Leland Stanford for more than
this; it was because his was a noble nat
ure which rose supesior to his posses
sions vast as they were and made them
his servants for the development of far
reaching plans for the benefit of hu
manity.
President Jordan's Remarks.
Dr. Jordan arose and said: "Pardon
me for adding a few words in this line
of thought.
"The first time I saw Gov. Stanford,
almost three years ago today, among the
other things he said to me and which I
shall ever remember was this: Speak
ing of the days of the winter of March,
1884, just after the death of his son and
Prmhlent. Jordan's Remarks—Continued-.
the loss ot his hopes and those of his
wife lie was telling me that in the night
in the darkest time the thought came to
him: "The childrn of California shall be
my children." Some time after that I
asked Gov Stanford il we could use
those words as a motto, lie said when
the state of California should wish to
say that it would be time enough; but
in his time he did not wish me to say it.
I have permitted the words to be put
upon the program today. For we rec
ognize now that the children of Califor
nia are indeed his children.
"The last words 1 heard Gov. Stanfard
utter was vpon the 9th of June last
year, when he said: 'Man's physical
needs are slight, his intellectual needs
are boundless. I learn every year to
love more arid more this landscape—the
sky and these foothills and these moun
tains; this the poorest man in California
may enjoy as well as the richest ' And
this is his legacy to California."
Ex-President Harrison.
President Jordan, Ladies and Centle
men : What I shall say today will be
the unstudied tribute of a friend to the
memory of a friend. My acquaintance

with Governor Stanford was not long—
a half score of years would cover it—
but I saw hirn during those years under
many varying conditions, and was now
and then brought into such touch with
him that his mind and heart were very
fully revealed to me.
This visit to California, to Palo Alto,
to the Leland Stanford Junior Univers
ity, is one that I have looked forward
to fora year with great interest and
with great anticipations. Not a little
of that interest was centered in the fact
that the arrangement involved a meeting
with Governor Stanford here at the
scene of his greatest work. My coming
is saddened by his abseuce. As I re
marked the osher day to the students, 1
realize now first that he is dead. When
oue dies at a distance from us we hear
of the event and our minds receive it as
a truth; but the heart does not realize
it until wo come to some place where
we might expect to meet our friend It
it the Vacant chair in the family it is
the abseuce from accustomed places that
brings to us th' realization of the loss
of a friend. I had learned to have a
very high regard for Governor
Stanford; to see in him some of the
noblest attributes that adorn human
nature, and chief among these was the
gentle, loving character of his nature.
Too often those who have been enabled
by successful business enterprise to
gather about them all the luxuries of
wealth. so that everything is tributary
to them, come to be unsympathetic and
forgetful of their fellowmen, to be nar
row and selfish. Such was not the in
fluence of his great possessions upon
him. His wealth was a vehicle of
charity. We have not a few families
in this eountry who, from generation to
generation seem to concentrate all
their energies upon the accumulation of
irreat fortunes and the entailment of
them upon their children. Such as
these may be stars of the first magni
tude when only four hundied are as
sembled, but th 1 Lick telescope cannot
find them when the world is gathered.
Wealth has become to be condemned;
to be under suspicion, because of its
selfishni ss; not because it is in inself a
thing that has not high and great uses
—not because it is necessarily a barrier
over which human hearts may not pass.
The considerateness of Governor
Stanford, during the four years I spent
last at Washington, always touched me.
lie seemed to realize the burdens of
the great office which I held, and al
ways approached me in a manner almost
apologetic, that he should intrude any
further care or business upon my atten
tion. In all his relations to men in
public life he was modest, kindly, and
considerate, and often added a sugges
tion of practical wisdom to the consulta
tion that roused our admiration and not
infrequently secured our adherence.
What a great thing it is when one
may have a Founders' Pay to commem
orate his birth ! How short human life
is, and how inadequate! When men
die we say their earthly work is ended;
and fora majority, and to our limited
observation, it is largely true. Of
course no good life ends at death; but
the threads of influence they have
started extend over limited spaees, touch
a few hearts, and are undiscovered to
the common eye. There is not time in
a human life to complete a great work.
There must be succession. Perpetuity

! is essential to grout works; and no one
more fully realized this than Governor
Stanford. He was an organizer. His
thoughts were large, and he understood
the philosophy of bringing other m n n
into partnership with his designs of
enlarging the individual touch by co
operation. Take the two great enter
prises with which he was associated.
The trans-continental railway—what a
| wide and strong organization was nec
essary to its accomplishment ! Not one
man ! What could one pick or one
shovel or one engineer do in the con
struction of that great enterprise ? It
was a scheme that needed to have
brought into it many men of diverse
mental attainments, and the muscle of
many laborers, and all these into a sys
tem that worked like a perfected ma
-1 chine—all this he did. And this great
highway of commerce, which in the
! future years shall bear an increasing
traffic between the east and the west,
and shall carry, with increasing comfort,
speed, and safety, generations yet to be
born, is one of the great works that will
perpetually praise him. This is one of
his biographers, and it has written on
the ro"ky faces of the Sierra canons the
i story of his participation in one of the
great achievements of the century.
This University is his other and bet
ter biographer—not a highway of com
merce— but a highway of the soul,
upon which the aspiring feet may per
petually be borne to the heights of
truth and learning. And here, how
perfectly can we see this fine faculty of
design; of organization; of bringing in
that which is needful; of using the ele
ment of perpetuity For, when these
learned men who now instruct, and this
yenerution of students, have passed
away, there will be new instructors
standing yet nearer to the summits of
j truth, to instruct a generation of stu
dents full of a nobler enthusiasm for
: learning and for the elevation of the
race. It is as men associate themselves
with such institutions that their mem
ory is perpetuated. Why is Washing-
I ton freshly and ever in our hearts?
Why is his natal day perpetually kept
in remembrance? Because he asso
i eiated himself with the deliverance of
the colonies from foreign domination

A Fitting Program Listened To by the
Whole Stanford Community.
The shower during the night wan
over, and the day which was to mark
the first general participation of the
Stanford community in a tribute to the
founder of the University broke fresh
and clear upon the broad aud verdant
Santa Clara valley, dotted with the
darker green of the oak, and sheltered,
to the east and to the west by parallel
divisions of the picturesque Coast
Range. White clouds floating over the
wooded mountain tops to the seaward
lent, an additional charm to the sur
roundings that have made the location
of the University lamous.
From all directions groups of stu
dents turned their faces towards the
scene of the morning's exercises, and
sometime before ten o'clock Fncina
gymnasium was filled to its utmost seat
ing ijapacity; but the crowd continued to
increase until when the exercises began
there wore about ten hundred and fiftj
persons present, fully a third of whom
were women Then, for the first time
in the short history of the Univeisity,
was gathered together the community
which forms its life.
At one end of the gymnasium was a
raised platform upon which the
speakers and the trustees were seated,
and at the back of the platform were
hung a life size portrait of Iceland
Stanford, Jr., and a smaller one of Sen
ator Stanford, while overhead were
draped three large American fl >gs.
On all sides and almost covering the
walls oi the building were decorations
of palm leaves, bamboo branches, and
other evergreens.
The seats near the platform were oc
cupied by members of the faculty and
by Mrs. Stanford, who took her place
amid prolonged applause. Those who
furnished the program were introduced
by President Jordan.
The opening musical selection, "Even
ing Prayer," was beautifully rendered
by the Stanford String Quartet, com
posed of Thomas, first violin; Chase,

prayer by Prof. A. B. Show; after
which the memorial ode was read by
Prof. A. <>. Newcomer. Following
this came an address delivered by Hon.

It is a happy suggestion to set apart

One living example of public spirit
like this is worth a library of sermons
As Governor Stanford Maid in his ad
dress on the opening day of the Uni
versity, speaking of the influence of the
teacher upon the student, "by precept
the road is long, but short and sure by
example."
Action is worth more than precept.
Life moves more than philosophy, and
every generous act repeats itself on a
larger or smaller scale, as the case may
be; and the world profits by the lives of
its heroes long after they have passed
away.
But I do not stand here to eulogize
these noble gifts. Their monument is
around you. Their worth has been ex
pressed by better tongues than mine.
I would rather devote the time al
lotted me to the leading incidents of
Governor Stanford's public life as illus
trating the expressed inteution of this
noble endowment.
His genius was a practical one, and
found its expression in deeds rather
than in words. For over thirty years
he was the most conspicuous figure in
the history of the tate, and he has
definitely impressed his influence upon
its history.
It was his good fortune to be made
governor of California in 1861, at the
most critical period of her history.
Those were indeed trying times. The
bloody struggle betwoen the North and
the South had already begun. The fed
eral troops had already met with disaster
at Hull Run. A large part of the
people of California came from the
states then in rebellion, and sympathized
with the Confederacy. Other leading
citizens openly favored the establish
ment of a Pacific Republic. In this
turmoil of opinion friend was arrayed
against friend, neighbor against neigh
bor. Intense passion was aroused on
either side, and we felt we were living
over a living volcano, which might
break out any day and engulf us in the
horrors of civil war on California soil.
The firm hand, the cool judgment, and
the execu.ive ability of the Governor
contributed largely to avert these
dangers, brought out the uuiou scnti
meut, saved us from civil war at our
very doors, and saved California to the
Union. From a condition of doubtful
loyalty she became a firm bulwark of
the federal government. Her gold,
flowing into the coffers of the treasury,
strengthened the arms of the central
government and her generous contribu
tions to the Sanitary Commission gave
cheer and comfort to the wounded sol
dier.

(Jut of the experience of these try
ing years grew a sense of the priceless
value of powerful, stable government,
and the duty of unswerving loyalty aud
good citizenship on the part of every
thinking man, a sentiment which is re
flected in that section of the Univer
sity charter which defines as one of its
purposes "to teach the blessings of lib
erty regulated by law, and to inculcate
love and reverence for the great princi
ples of the government"
At the close of his lerm of office he
threw his whole heart into the building
of the overland railway; speedy
completion , in the face of discourage
ments and difficulties of the most
formidable character, was due in great
degree to his energy and executive
power. In May, 1869, with due cere
mony, the last spike was driven and the
great chain of rails was completed, bind
ing the Atlantic to the Pacific By
this act California entered upon a new
era of history. Up to 1869 she had
been separated from her sister states by
a twenty-five day ocean voyage and a
transit of foreign territory. Now she
could reach the national capital in a
week's journey over our own soil, and
the Pacific Coast became, for the first
time in its history, practically an inte
gral part of the territory of our country.
I lay stress on these periods of the
state because they were the two decis
ive points which controlled her future,
and in each scene Governor Stanford
was the principal actor and his prac
tical genius mainly shaped the result.
After that memorable day at Prom
ontory, his life for many years was de
voted to developing the system of
transportation made necessary by the
overland road.
If his day had closed there he would
have been gratefully remembered for
these eminent services. But its set
ting was clouded by a bereavement
bringing unspeakable grief to his h me.
In the providence of God this deep
sorrow which fell upon his house was
transmitted into inestimable riches for
us; out of the desolation of their owu
home came the resolve of the founders
to consecrate this vast endowment
to the benefit and blessing of the
young. I shall never forget that day in
November, 1885, when this great trust
was consummated and the deed actually
delivered to the trustees. We had been
invited to meet the Governor and Mrs.
Stanford at their home in San Fran
cisco. They received us in the library
without pomp or parade; the trustees
were all present except Judge Field
and Judge Deady, who were delayed by
official duties; there were present also a
few of the Governor's official household
The grant of endowment was read.
Governor Stanford followed its reading
with a brief address, explaining their
purposes in the grant. Mrs. Stanford
expressed her cordial sympathy with
the plan. The deed was formally de
livered to the trustees, who subscribed
to their acceptance of the solemn duty—
and the University was founded.

I have witnessed many solemn cere
monies and pageantN in my life, but no
event is more deeply engraved on my
memory than that simple tranßfer. Two
j, ears later I was present at the laying
of the corner stone, and again in 1891
at the ceremonies of opening day, but
neither of these days impressed me like
that quiet scene in Governor Stanford's
library.
When I came to read over the grant
of endowment by myself I was struck
with some of its provisions which
seemed to regard the higher education
in a somewhat different light from what
I had been used to. In the charter the
purpose of the University is stated to
be the promotion of the public welfare.
The education itself shall be conducted
with a view to the general good. We
have long recognized this principle in
the public schools, that they have no
reason for being except as they contrib
ute to the general welfare, and espec
ially as they make good citizens; but
here is a new deoarture in scholastic
affairs.
"Its purpose," says the grant, "shall
be to promote the public welfare, by
exercising an influence in behalf of
humanity and civilization, teaching the
blessings of liberty regulated by law,
and inculcnting love and reverence for
the great principles of government as
derived from the inalienable rights of
man to life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness. Its object is to qualify stu
dents for personal success and direct
usefulness in life"; whilst its nature
and scope 8 l )all be those of a "Univer
sity of the highest grade."
1 am not going to discuss the methods
of carrying out these propositions.
They are in the hands of persons of
mature wisdom and educational exper
ience. They need no eulogy from me.
The wonderful success of the Univer
sity in its very infancy is in itself a vin
dication of their policy. Hut I would
call your attention fora few moments
to the "object" of the University, as
stated above: "To qualify students for
personal success and direct usefulness
in life." This idea is again defined in
the duties of the trustees "to fit the
graduate for some useful pursuit."
The central purpose of the endow
ment is to make good citizens. To this
end, whether men or women, they
must have a distinct vocation for which
the}* will need a technical training.
Second, they must be thoroughly
grounded in the principles of our gov
ernment, and in the rights and duties
attaching to all good citizenship.
Third, to all this is added a reverent
attitude towards the Almighty Ruler,
who is the author of all good, and the
sustainer of the universe.
I know of no educational endow
ment laid on a broader and more gen
erous basis than this. It knows neither
sex, creed, nor social distinction.
And here let me call to your minds
an interesting fact, that the first
scholarship ever endowed in America,

who is the author of all good, and the
sustainer of the universe.
I know of no educational endow
ment laid on a broader and more gen
erous basis than this. It knows neither
sex, creed, nor social distinction.
And here let me call to your minds
an interesting fact, that the first
scholarship ever endowed in America,
was the gift of a woman: Lady Ann
Mulson of London, in 1043, gave Har
vard College one hundred pounds
fora scholarship. It is a happy
incident of this occasion that the en
dowment of this University, the high
est siugle gift for educational purposes
ever made in our country, conceived on
the broadest aud most liberal basis,
should be shared by a woman.
These then, are the purposes of the
founders, to make good citizens, trained
to a purpose iu life, with loyalty to the
country and reverence for God. The
idle man without a purpose is a leech
upon society, whether he be among the
gilded youth of the cities or the tramp
by the wayside.
And Governor Stanford says in one
of his addresses, that for this end there
cannot be too much educatiou. The
broader you lay the foundations of his
training the better man the student
will make.
This proposition will not meet with
universal acceptance. I have often
heard men say there is already too
much education; that the ranks of
workers are now too much depleted, with
out any adequate addition to the
thinkers and the leaders. Less than
two years ago I heard Andrew Carnegie
maintain that a college education was a
positive injury to a boy meaning to en
ter the practical walks of life. To
undertake an extended discussion of
this subject would be out of place to
day. To my judgment the position is
so plainly untenable it seems like
threshing over old straw; but I may be
pardoned one or two suggestions. The
argument generally assumes one of two
forms. Sometimes it is put thus: Vau
derbilt, and Jay Gould, aud Abraham
Lincoln, aud Kdisou, were self-made
men; began at the bottom and worked
their way up against obstacles. There
fore, every * boy should do the same.
The second form is this: I saw a Har
vard graduate collecting fares on a street
car—ergo a college education is useless
in practical life. Now I will admit
that a college training will not help you
to collect nickles on a horse car. I will
go further aud admit it is of no use in
some varieties of what we call business.
If you want to gamble on the stock ex
change or the call board your professors
can not teach you the principle?; nor
does the University develop the in
stinct of buying cheap and selling dear.
There is the breadth of the world
between the faculties of diftereut men.
Some are born for horse car conductors
and no culture could make them other
wise. Some of these enter college, aud
then they pass for cases of arrested de
velopment. They cannot grow because
there is nothing to grow. An apple seed
will never raise an oak. You can never
get any more out of a man than
there is in him and the man who sends
his boy to college thinking wisdom can
be pumped into him, by the professors
wastes his money and his hopes.
The reverse of this is true also.
Many a man is born with a genius for
some pursuit. Jay Gould by phenome
nal sharpness became a millionaire; Edi
son's brain teemed from childhood with
dreams of harnessing nature into a
thousand new forms of usefulness;
while Lincoln, with a sympathy and
wisdom that were above all teaching ex
cept that of experience, felt every beat
of the nation's heart, and guided her
through her mortal peril with a wisdom

that seems almost supernatural. Such
men are born with a capacity lor con
quest in their spheres.
I suppose a great deal of this preju
dice against higher education is a legacy
coming down from the time when
the colleges taught nothing but Greek,
Latin, and mathematics, lu those days
there was a wide gap betweeu academic
education and practical life; but now
there is no such divorce. More money
is spent today on scientific education
than upon classical, and there is hardly
a vocation iu life for which a boy may
not lay a fitting foundation in college;
and the better preparation he has the
more he can make of himself. The
college will not give him brains, but if
will show him how to use what uature
has provided.
The boy that goes into the shop may
have the start in the begiuning, but
culture will tell in the long ruu. 1
know of no more suggestive example of
the power of technical training than the
experience of our country in the war.
Men from all walks of life offered their
services to their country, many of
them men of distinction of whom
some rose to places of great re
sponsibility iu the army; but when the
war closed, those trusted with the high
est command on both sides were grad
uates of West Point. Grant, Sherman,
l-ee, Sheridan, Thomas—l need uot
extend the list—the technical training
won in the end.
A better test is to look over the list
of graduates ot such a school as the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
and see what uniform success has come
to them in after life.
There is a common prejudice that
college men take no interest in politics,
that such a training unfits a man for
political liie. If this were so, educa
tion does not make good citizens —but
it is not so. The recoids of Congress
show übout onefourth the members of
both Houses are college graduates, while
another fourth have received a partial
education in some college or professional
school. Now when we consider that in
1880 the whole number of college grad
uates, as near as could be
was less than one-seventeenth of the
adult male population, it amountsalniost
to an aristocracy if they hold onefourth
of the seats in Congress. To put it dif
ferently: the chances of any graduate of
this University becoming a congressman
or senator are eighteen-fold greater than
those of his brother who lud no college
training.
Hut there is something a man gains
by an academic training which is better
than what we ordinarily mean by "suc
cess," bitter than a seat in Con
gress, or even thau the riches of
Jay Gould. It is the atmosphere
of learning and letters which he
breathed in there; whose power, if he
have any affinity for culture, will in
spire his whole life. The true success
is to be measured by what a man is,
not by what he does; and the trained
mind, the love of learning, the society
of learning, the society of the best men
of all times, which a man gains by a
liberal education, ought to make a larger
aud a better man. Talk of the injury
a boy sustains by receiving an educa
tion. Did you ever know a college
graduate who was sorry he had been
educated? No. I would give a boy
all the university training he would

take. That is an inheritance he never
can lose, a fortune nobody cau rob him
of.
I have dwelt especially on the train
ing in practical things, because our
charter lays particular stress on the
ueed of this. Hut it goes farther aud
provides iu express terms for a "univer
sity of the highest grade," specifying
among other things, "museums, gal
leries of art, and the studies aud exer
cises directed to the cultivation and en
largement of the mind." Under these
are included departments ol philosophy
and classical learning, while the ripe
experience of the founders led them to
insist that iu the University should be
taught on the broadest uusectariau
grounds "the immortality of the soul,
the existence of an all-wise and benevo
lent Creator, aud that obedience to his
laws is the hignest duty of man." Poe
try, art, and religion, these arc the
bloom and aroma of our existence —
without them human life sinks to the
level of a mere machinc; the creaking of
the wheels drowns the mu.iic of the
spheres, and the dust of the highway
shuts out the light of the over-arching
sky.
I say to you as a practical man of
affairs immersed in business all my ma
ture years, these higher pursuits
1 have found cheer and comfort through
the trials of life. Do not neglect theui.
Cultivate the useful for your daily
bread, but cherish the beautiful for the
solace of your leisure hours. Cultivate
the practical, but uever loose your hold
on the spiritual. The University offers
you both. Indeed, it is the stamp of
the true university that it must include
iu its range all sides of human learning
and human experienc e
And when it shall close its doors
upon you, and you pa:?8 out upon the
threshold of active life, you will Com
plete the generous designs of the found
ers, filling your places iu the worid as
faithful workers, good citizens, noble,
wel'-balauced men and women, briug
ing satisfaction to yourselves and honor
to your Alma Mater.

[Mr. Sibley of Pennsylvania.]
I shall not dwell upon his business
career, but in passing recount one inci
dent. Looking off to the great Sierra
Nevada range rising to the heavens as a
snow-whue, impenetrable barrier, he
told me the story of the building of the
Central Pacific road over their mighty
summits. He told me how, with three
other men, none of them rich, he would
meet at night and t. ilk about the neces
sity of something faster than a pony
express from the Missouri river to the
Pacific, and something pleasanter than
a stage coach and emigrant trail; aud
then how these four men, whose total
means were not adequate to build one
•single mile through some portions of
the mountaius, determined that they
would start the road and demonstrate to
the world the possibility of a railroad
over the Sierras. Krieuds laughed at
them, even jeered at them; entreated of
them not to hazard life's earnings in so
hazardous an enterprise. He told me
of the trials and discouragements, and
that for more than two yeais he did not
know whether he was worth millions or
poorer than a penniless beggar. Hut

the work went on to completion, aiul
what had been a dream yesterday wan
an accomplished fact today.
The building of the Central Pacific
railroad gives the clue to theVwhole life
of this man, whose projects were so
grand us to inspire doubts, yet wheu
tested found so practical as to utterly
dispel them, lie had laith in himself,
and what is so often lacking in great
minds, he had a most trustful faith iu
others.
One day at Palo Alto he showed me
the beautiful park in the centre of
which had been started the foundations
of a home.for his only son, who had
died some three years before. He told
me of the boy's character and his am
bitions for him; and then we went to
gether to the tomb of the boy, and he
told amid tears and sobs how since the
death of his son he had adopted and
taken to his heart and love every friend
less boy and girl in all the land; and
that so far as his means afforded, they
should go to make the path of every
such an one smoother and brighter; and
that with the increase in values of the
property giveu to the Leland Stanford
,Jr. University, he hoped that, it would
yet be able to feed, clothe, and educate
all the poor but aspiring youth of the
1'acific Slope.
One little digression here iu point.
My partner and my elf had purchased
a young colt of him, for which we paid
him SI'J.500. He took out his check
book, drew two checks of 86,250 each,
and seut them to two different city
homes for friendless children, and with
a twinkle in his eye, and broadly beam
ing benevolence in his features, said:
' Electric Hell ought to make a great
horse; he starts in making so uiauy
people happy in the very beginning of
his life.''
[Mr. Blair. |
Guided by an acute moral sense and
controlled by warm and generous sym
pathies, the deductions of his intellect
ripened into benovelence and compre
hensive action for the good of man upon
a scale which for maguitnde and pros
pective consequences s unsurpassed if
not unequalled in the whole history of
the race.
He was especially interested in pro
moting the welfare of the common peo
ple and uny measure which proposed to
increase their happiness at once com
manded his atteution and support.
J The laboring man had no wiser or truer
friend.
He was bom to conquer and to rule,
but his conquests cost no tear«, made
no slaves, marred no lands. He con
quered the obstacles of nature,
leveled mountains, filled valleys, an
nihilated distances, overcame time, wat
ered deserts and made them bloom He
| conquered greed and sordid self and
I made all that was his portion of each as
piring youth of the land. He con
quered poverty and lack of opportunity
for thousands living and thousands yet
unborn. He saw in every trieudless
boy a son.
[Mr. Wheeler of Alabama ]
It was his marvellous achievements
alone that s'amped him as great among
men; it was not that he was richest
anions his fellows and had millions of
money and great corporations under his
control The world respected and es
teemed Leland Stanford for more than
this; it was because his was a noble nat
ure which rose supesior to his posses
sions vast as they were and made them
his servants for the development of far
reaching plans for the benefit of hu
manity.
President Jordan's Remarks.
Dr. Jordan arose and said: "Pardon
me for adding a few words in this line
of thought.
"The first time I saw Gov. Stanford,
almost three years ago today, among the
other things he said to me and which I
shall ever remember was this: Speak
ing of the days of the winter of March,
1884, just after the death of his son and
Mulson of London, in 1043, gave Har
vard College one hundred pounds
fora scholarship. It is a happy
incident of this occasion that the en
dowment of this University, the high
est siugle gift for educational purposes
ever made in our country, conceived on
the broadest aud most liberal basis,
should be shared by a woman.
These then, are the purposes of the
founders, to make good citizens, trained
to a purpose iu life, with loyalty to the
country and reverence for God. The
idle man without a purpose is a leech
upon society, whether he be among the
gilded youth of the cities or the tramp
by the wayside.
And Governor Stanford says in one
of his addresses, that for this end there
cannot be too much educatiou. The
broader you lay the foundations of his
training the better man the student
will make.
This proposition will not meet with
universal acceptance. I have often
heard men say there is already too
much education; that the ranks of
workers are now too much depleted, with
out any adequate addition to the
thinkers and the leaders. Less than
two years ago I heard Andrew Carnegie
maintain that a college education was a
positive injury to a boy meaning to en
ter the practical walks of life. To
undertake an extended discussion of
this subject would be out of place to
day. To my judgment the position is
so plainly untenable it seems like
threshing over old straw; but I may be
pardoned one or two suggestions. The
argument generally assumes one of two
forms. Sometimes it is put thus: Vau
derbilt, and Jay Gould, aud Abraham
Lincoln, aud Kdisou, were self-made
men; began at the bottom and worked
their way up against obstacles. There
fore, every * boy should do the same.
The second form is this: I saw a Har
vard graduate collecting fares on a street
car—ergo a college education is useless
in practical life. Now I will admit
that a college training will not help you
to collect nickles on a horse car. I will
go further aud admit it is of no use in
some varieties of what we call business.
If you want to gamble on the stock ex
change or the call board your professors
can not teach you the principle?; nor
does the University develop the in
stinct of buying cheap and selling dear.
There is the breadth of the world
between the faculties of diftereut men.
Some are born for horse car conductors
and no culture could make them other
wise. Some of these enter college, aud
then they pass for cases of arrested de
velopment. They cannot grow because
there is nothing to grow. An apple seed
will never raise an oak. You can never
get any more out of a man than
there is in him and the man who sends
his boy to college thinking wisdom can
be pumped into him, by the professors
wastes his money and his hopes.
The reverse of this is true also.
Many a man is born with a genius for
some pursuit. Jay Gould by phenome
nal sharpness became a millionaire; Edi
son's brain teemed from childhood with
dreams of harnessing nature into a
thousand new forms of usefulness;
while Lincoln, with a sympathy and
wisdom that were above all teaching ex
cept that of experience, felt every beat
of the nation's heart, and guided her
through her mortal peril with a wisdom

that seems almost supernatural. Such
men are born with a capacity lor con
quest in their spheres.
I suppose a great deal of this preju
dice against higher education is a legacy
coming down from the time when
the colleges taught nothing but Greek,
Latin, and mathematics, lu those days
there was a wide gap betweeu academic
education and practical life; but now
there is no such divorce. More money
is spent today on scientific education
than upon classical, and there is hardly
a vocation iu life for which a boy may
not lay a fitting foundation in college;
and the better preparation he has the
more he can make of himself. The
college will not give him brains, but if
will show him how to use what uature
has provided.
The boy that goes into the shop may
have the start in the begiuning, but
culture will tell in the long ruu. 1
know of no more suggestive example of
the power of technical training than the
experience of our country in the war.
Men from all walks of life offered their
services to their country, many of
them men of distinction of whom
some rose to places of great re
sponsibility iu the army; but when the
war closed, those trusted with the high
est command on both sides were grad
uates of West Point. Grant, Sherman,
l-ee, Sheridan, Thomas—l need uot
extend the list—the technical training
won in the end.
A better test is to look over the list
of graduates ot such a school as the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
and see what uniform success has come
to them in after life.
There is a common prejudice that
college men take no interest in politics,
that such a training unfits a man for
political liie. If this were so, educa
tion does not make good citizens —but
it is not so. The recoids of Congress
show übout onefourth the members of
both Houses are college graduates, while
another fourth have received a partial
education in some college or professional
school. Now when we consider that in
1880 the whole number of college grad
uates, as near as could be
was less than one-seventeenth of the
adult male population, it amountsalniost
to an aristocracy if they hold onefourth
of the seats in Congress. To put it dif
ferently: the chances of any graduate of
this University becoming a congressman
or senator are eighteen-fold greater than
those of his brother who lud no college
training.
Hut there is something a man gains
by an academic training which is better
than what we ordinarily mean by "suc
cess," bitter than a seat in Con
gress, or even thau the riches of
Jay Gould. It is the atmosphere
of learning and letters which he
breathed in there; whose power, if he
have any affinity for culture, will in
spire his whole life. The true success
is to be measured by what a man is,
not by what he does; and the trained
mind, the love of learning, the society
of learning, the society of the best men
of all times, which a man gains by a
liberal education, ought to make a larger
aud a better man. Talk of the injury
a boy sustains by receiving an educa
tion. Did you ever know a college
graduate who was sorry he had been
educated? No. I would give a boy
all the university training he would

take. That is an inheritance he never
can lose, a fortune nobody cau rob him
of.
I have dwelt especially on the train
ing in practical things, because our
charter lays particular stress on the
ueed of this. Hut it goes farther aud
provides iu express terms for a "univer
sity of the highest grade," specifying
among other things, "museums, gal
leries of art, and the studies aud exer
cises directed to the cultivation and en
largement of the mind." Under these
are included departments ol philosophy
and classical learning, while the ripe
experience of the founders led them to
insist that iu the University should be
taught on the broadest uusectariau
grounds "the immortality of the soul,
the existence of an all-wise and benevo
lent Creator, aud that obedience to his
laws is the hignest duty of man." Poe
try, art, and religion, these arc the
bloom and aroma of our existence —
without them human life sinks to the
level of a mere machinc; the creaking of
the wheels drowns the mu.iic of the
spheres, and the dust of the highway
shuts out the light of the over-arching
sky.
I say to you as a practical man of
affairs immersed in business all my ma
ture years, these higher pursuits
1 have found cheer and comfort through
the trials of life. Do not neglect theui.
Cultivate the useful for your daily
bread, but cherish the beautiful for the
solace of your leisure hours. Cultivate
the practical, but uever loose your hold
on the spiritual. The University offers
you both. Indeed, it is the stamp of
the true university that it must include
iu its range all sides of human learning
and human experienc e
And when it shall close its doors
upon you, and you pa:?8 out upon the
threshold of active life, you will Com
plete the generous designs of the found
ers, filling your places iu the worid as
faithful workers, good citizens, noble,
wel'-balauced men and women, briug
ing satisfaction to yourselves and honor
to your Alma Mater.

Ex-President Harrison.
President Jordan, Ladies and Centle
men : What I shall say today will be
the unstudied tribute of a friend to the
memory of a friend. My acquaintance

with Governor Stanford was not long—
a half score of years would cover it—
but I saw hirn during those years under
many varying conditions, and was now
and then brought into such touch with
him that his mind and heart were very
fully revealed to me.
This visit to California, to Palo Alto,
to the Leland Stanford Junior Univers
ity, is one that I have looked forward
to fora year with great interest and
with great anticipations. Not a little
of that interest was centered in the fact
that the arrangement involved a meeting
with Governor Stanford here at the
scene of his greatest work. My coming
is saddened by his abseuce. As I re
marked the osher day to the students, 1
realize now first that he is dead. When
oue dies at a distance from us we hear
of the event and our minds receive it as
a truth; but the heart does not realize
it until wo come to some place where
we might expect to meet our friend It
it the Vacant chair in the family it is
the abseuce from accustomed places that
brings to us th' realization of the loss
of a friend. I had learned to have a
very high regard for Governor
Stanford; to see in him some of the
noblest attributes that adorn human
nature, and chief among these was the
gentle, loving character of his nature.
Too often those who have been enabled
by successful business enterprise to
gather about them all the luxuries of
wealth. so that everything is tributary
to them, come to be unsympathetic and
forgetful of their fellowmen, to be nar
row and selfish. Such was not the in
fluence of his great possessions upon
him. His wealth was a vehicle of
charity. We have not a few families
in this eountry who, from generation to
generation seem to concentrate all
their energies upon the accumulation of
irreat fortunes and the entailment of
them upon their children. Such as
these may be stars of the first magni
tude when only four hundied are as
sembled, but th 1 Lick telescope cannot
find them when the world is gathered.
Wealth has become to be condemned;
to be under suspicion, because of its
selfishni ss; not because it is in inself a
thing that has not high and great uses
—not because it is necessarily a barrier
over which human hearts may not pass.
The considerateness of Governor
Stanford, during the four years I spent
last at Washington, always touched me.
lie seemed to realize the burdens of
the great office which I held, and al
ways approached me in a manner almost
apologetic, that he should intrude any
further care or business upon my atten
tion. In all his relations to men in
public life he was modest, kindly, and
considerate, and often added a sugges
tion of practical wisdom to the consulta
tion that roused our admiration and not
infrequently secured our adherence.
What a great thing it is when one
may have a Founders' Pay to commem
orate his birth ! How short human life
is, and how inadequate! When men
die we say their earthly work is ended;
and fora majority, and to our limited
observation, it is largely true. Of
course no good life ends at death; but
the threads of influence they have
started extend over limited spaees, touch
a few hearts, and are undiscovered to
the common eye. There is not time in
a human life to complete a great work.
There must be succession. Perpetuity

! is essential to grout works; and no one
more fully realized this than Governor
Stanford. He was an organizer. His
thoughts were large, and he understood
the philosophy of bringing other m n n
into partnership with his designs of
enlarging the individual touch by co
operation. Take the two great enter
prises with which he was associated.
The trans-continental railway—what a
| wide and strong organization was nec
essary to its accomplishment ! Not one
man ! What could one pick or one
shovel or one engineer do in the con
struction of that great enterprise ? It
was a scheme that needed to have
brought into it many men of diverse
mental attainments, and the muscle of
many laborers, and all these into a sys
tem that worked like a perfected ma
-1 chine—all this he did. And this great
highway of commerce, which in the
! future years shall bear an increasing
traffic between the east and the west,
and shall carry, with increasing comfort,
speed, and safety, generations yet to be
born, is one of the great works that will
perpetually praise him. This is one of
his biographers, and it has written on
the ro"ky faces of the Sierra canons the
i story of his participation in one of the
great achievements of the century.
This University is his other and bet
ter biographer—not a highway of com
merce— but a highway of the soul,
upon which the aspiring feet may per
petually be borne to the heights of
truth and learning. And here, how
perfectly can we see this fine faculty of
design; of organization; of bringing in
that which is needful; of using the ele
ment of perpetuity For, when these
learned men who now instruct, and this
yenerution of students, have passed
away, there will be new instructors
standing yet nearer to the summits of
j truth, to instruct a generation of stu
dents full of a nobler enthusiasm for
: learning and for the elevation of the
race. It is as men associate themselves
with such institutions that their mem
ory is perpetuated. Why is Washing-
I ton freshly and ever in our hearts?
Why is his natal day perpetually kept
in remembrance? Because he asso
i eiated himself with the deliverance of
the colonies from foreign domination
and oppression, and with the institution
jof a system of government that has
brought liberty, happiness, and freedom
to this great continent, and will carry
them on to generations to co'ue. Na
poleon we lead of; we analyze his
character and study his military genius
much as one of these professors—and
with little more reverence —might ex
amine and explain to a class the artic
| ulated skeleton of some unknown man.
He d'd not associate himself with any
great thing in the interest of man, with
any great state or institution that had
perpetuity.
But I will not detain you longer.
Our sorrow for the loss of a friend is
j greatly mitigated when we can assemble
as we do today, surrounded by evi
dences that, not only in the family
circle, but throughout all this coast,
throughout all these states, and indeed,
throughout the world, he will be held
in perpetual veneration and respect.
One loved child was lost, but the
promise—the Abrahamie promise —
) shall be fulfilled to him—his children
shall be more than the sands of the sea,
for multitude.

operation. Take the two great enter
prises with which he was associated.
The trans-continental railway—what a
| wide and strong organization was nec
essary to its accomplishment ! Not one
man ! What could one pick or one
shovel or one engineer do in the con
struction of that great enterprise ? It
was a scheme that needed to have
brought into it many men of diverse
mental attainments, and the muscle of
many laborers, and all these into a sys
tem that worked like a perfected ma
-1 chine—all this he did. And this great
highway of commerce, which in the
! future years shall bear an increasing
traffic between the east and the west,
and shall carry, with increasing comfort,
speed, and safety, generations yet to be
born, is one of the great works that will
perpetually praise him. This is one of
his biographers, and it has written on
the ro"ky faces of the Sierra canons the
i story of his participation in one of the
great achievements of the century.
This University is his other and bet
ter biographer—not a highway of com
merce— but a highway of the soul,
upon which the aspiring feet may per
petually be borne to the heights of
truth and learning. And here, how
perfectly can we see this fine faculty of
design; of organization; of bringing in
that which is needful; of using the ele
ment of perpetuity For, when these
learned men who now instruct, and this
yenerution of students, have passed
away, there will be new instructors
standing yet nearer to the summits of
j truth, to instruct a generation of stu
dents full of a nobler enthusiasm for
: learning and for the elevation of the
race. It is as men associate themselves
with such institutions that their mem
ory is perpetuated. Why is Washing-
I ton freshly and ever in our hearts?
Why is his natal day perpetually kept
in remembrance? Because he asso
i eiated himself with the deliverance of
the colonies from foreign domination
and oppression, and with the institution
jof a system of government that has
brought liberty, happiness, and freedom
to this great continent, and will carry
them on to generations to co'ue. Na
poleon we lead of; we analyze his
character and study his military genius
much as one of these professors—and
with little more reverence —might ex
amine and explain to a class the artic
| ulated skeleton of some unknown man.
He d'd not associate himself with any
great thing in the interest of man, with
any great state or institution that had
perpetuity.
But I will not detain you longer.
Our sorrow for the loss of a friend is
j greatly mitigated when we can assemble
as we do today, surrounded by evi
dences that, not only in the family
circle, but throughout all this coast,
throughout all these states, and indeed,
throughout the world, he will be held
in perpetual veneration and respect.
One loved child was lost, but the
promise—the Abrahamie promise —
) shall be fulfilled to him—his children
shall be more than the sands of the sea,
for multitude.
