All through life our most cherished
memories will cling round our college
days. Our life as students has been
richer cf late in the incidents that will
always refresh us with their memory
than it will ever be again. In the
years to come when life is waning and
hopes are lading, and ambition is dead,
no glimpses into the past will be fraught
with sweater thoughts than those which
take us back to such an occasion as this
morning, when we were all gathered
together for the common purpose of
paying a tribute of love and adaiiration
to a noble man of generous heart now
shrouded by the days ot darkness that
know no dawn.
Reverie has no more tender pleasure
than to see flitting through the sha
dows of memory events that have re
vealed in us depths of gratitude of
which we believed ourselves incapable.
Moments of elevation when self is for
gotten will ever form the most treasured
pictures of the^past.
The stillness through the exercises
and the silent reverence of the audience
was as worthy a tribute of honor to our
founder as it was possible for us to offer.
No words could more kindly extol the
beneficence of him in whose memory
we met than those which embodied the
feeling and emotions of the personal
friends who spoke of him.
'fhe remembrance of this morning's
exercises will ever remain among our
dearest recollections Nothing can dis
lodge it from the place of honor it must
ever have in our reminiscences. Nor
can anything efface from our life the
elevation imparted to it by a share in
noble sentiments of gratitude and love.
