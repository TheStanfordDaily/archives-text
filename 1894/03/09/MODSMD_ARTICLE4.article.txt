[Delivered in the ohapol Thursday afternoon.]
In the name of the Catholic University
of America at Washington I most affection
ately greet the faculty and the students of
Stauford University. I have long desired
to visit this grand educational institution
for the one great reason that it is one of
the great institutions in the country that
can contest, with our university the advan
tage of being the youngest educational in
stitution of the laud. I say it with an
honest heart that in its youth this Univer
sity has a great advantage.
When I visit the old educational institu
tions of the country in all sincerity Ire
gard them with all the reverence which
their antiquity deserves. lam convinced
that the great advantage is with those who
star' last in the race. The greatest of all
advantages is to start young, provided you
have the wisdom. We who have started
late have not only the advantages of passed
conclusions, but have the experience by
which they were reached. I see the good
influences of the presen* time, and I see
the good prospects of a better time to come.
Pessimism is overcome by the reading ot
good and healthy history. We learn by
the successes and failures ot others; by
making mistakes we learn.
The intellectual world is always full of
problems. During the past many have
been solved. V\'e have the advantage of
reaching the conclusions which in the so
lution of these problems have been worked
out. There are problems which come not
merely dealing with matter and lorce but,
the mind and its relation to material or
ganization through which it exercises its
activity. There are great problems of
social science and problems which concern
the organization ot human lite We are to
face them bravely and, above all, honestly.
I have no faith in the man who is a'raid to
face the future. There are men who seem
to think that the working out of the world's
problems is going to do the world harm.
1 am convinced that, the working out of all
problems is good for the world.
The most important of these prohlems
which we shall have to face are those that
concern man: for, after all. what is im
portant to man is man. What force can
be compared to the force ot human know
ledge and thought and activity? This is
what characterizes a university and places
it above mere schools of technology the
study and comprehension of that which is
human. In this all important department
of human thought there is a great problem
that has been pending for half a century
before the mind of the world, the working
out of which we are now witnessing.
Early in this century a man ot undoubt
ed genius formulated an hypothesis of
human life atid activity and its possibilities
in the future. The author of this was
Auguste Comte. He divided his theory as
follows: theological, the study of man
through divine reve'ation; philosophical,
study of humanity through metaphysics;
and scientific, recognizing the linking to
gether of natural phenomena.
The theory that the scientific is now the
only tr ie view is a great and enticing one.
Working on tins basis of science men have
tried to orgnnize all phenomena and ar
range them in the light, of science. Pr >112.
Huxley has admitted that the philosophy
ot cosmic evolution does not contain the
elements for the making of human life a
success He says human life cannot, he
perfect without ethical principles, ana in
order that human progress be successful
there must be the aspiration for good, bet
ter, best. But t his is not found in the cos
mic evolution because its two great prin
ciples ate the struggle for existence and
the survival of the fittest Human life will
not woik without the evolution of the good,
the better, and the best. So we must look
elsewhere for the great ethical principle
that, is to guide humanity. But where?
It is only by generalization that the
scientist builds up science. The true
scientist rise- through this step of gener
alization to high pure mathematics. Here
he gets the yet higher revelation of truth.
Generalization is the basis of science, and
by generalization I mean true scientific
observation. From this he gradually rises
to mind, which is superior to mere matler.
It is in truth that the first cause and the
last, result are harmonized.
The true scientist recognizes that nar
rowness is the great evil, and that the
great cure-all is breadth of mind. The
true scientist is the only man who can be a
true philosopher and can do justice to re
ligion .
The mind behind this truth was that of
a philosopher, who had a deep insight into
the wot kings of our century and who said:
I do not want my institution to start in
the dark, I do not want it to be like the
owls who hoot that there is no sun in the
sky because they cannot see it. I want it
to start in the light that the young men and
women to be educated in my institution
can go forth a credit to humanity.
