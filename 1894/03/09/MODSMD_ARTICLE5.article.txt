# Memorial Ode, by Prof. Newcomer.

### 
No life in lost, one says; no man's work
dies
Utterly; none that looks upon the skies
But leaves some record as secure as they
From death and death's decay.
Lo, this is fate. Put forth thy strong
hand where
Men lal>or in Time's garden-plot today,
Eternity shall find the impress there.
And haply this may be
But one says, Nay, there is nanglit that
abides.
Time is a wide unfathomable sea
'Neath whose recurrent tides
Are swallowed up all things implacably.
This rock-built earth whereof man makes
his home
Is less than the sea's foam;
The galaxies of stars that seem to him
Perdurable as time, like bubbles swim
Upon its surface and like them will burst;
Yea,time itself that swallows up all these
Must yield in turn, the last lost as the
first—
Must sink whence it arose,
Flow backward whence it Hows,
Into eternity's soundless shoreless seas.
What may be true? Is life less full or
fair,
Does deeper darkness gather o'er men's
eyes
Than when our fathers importuned the
skies
For light withliolden there?
The sun shines warm today as yesterday,
The green grass fails not when the rains
return,
And ivy twines about the burial urn,
And summer winds through leattess
branches play,
Hearken, by day, by night, and thou
mayest hear
Ascending ever one unchanging tune,
The voice of all earth's choristers
a-croon,
The world-song low and clear.
No age hath listened for this song in
vain;
Though one voice dies another swells
the strain,
And Homer calls and Shakspere answers
Her el
And loss is balanced by unfailing gain.
Vet there is loss The splendid per
fumed rose
That blooms today within thy garden
close—
Ah, like it is but is not yet the flower
Thou wovest once in one fair maiden's
hair
To shed its perfume and its splendor
there
And crown love's supreme hour.
And though this rose as that be fair and
sweet,
Yea, though all rose-delights in this rose
meet,
Too well, too well thou knowest it hath
no power
Save in a mocking vision to recall
Youth's vanished festival.
Ay, there is loss Though rose return
for rose,
Somewhither each one goes
Nor comes again in its own form and hue;
And love that springs from dead love's
urned repose
Makes not the old joy new.
Ah for this transitory human life,
Where at the last all strivers cease from
strife
And over them and theirs is cast the
spell
Of death's Irrevocable!
Where unto them that have so nobly
striven
For heaven's best boon, behold what
boon is given:
A little time of hopes and joys and fears,
A little sound of music in their ears,
A little light upon their eyes and then
Darkness again.
Prayer shall avail not to avert this doom;
For man and all that man's hand
fashioneth
Shall find within the wide domain of
death
An unremembered tomb.

But hold ! The eyes of men
Made keen with penetrating through the
veil
Behind which matter hides it from our
ken,
Have found, past all doubt's mockery to
assail,
An immortality within the clod,
An essence that shall live unchallenged
on
Though the live light of sunlit heaven
should fail
And earth wait vainly for one darkling
dawn, —
Perchance incarnate God.
Pent in the silent caverns of the earth,
Scarce stirred since the world's
birth,
Or brought where the rains nourish, the
sun warms,
To gather vigor of the sun and rains
And pass through thousand Protean
forms
Of blade and blossom, stone and beast
and tree
And man's supremacy,
Through change unchanged this essence
still remains.
The essence? Are the forms al>olished
then?
Not so; these too abide,
As in the ocean's tide
Abides forever the high curling crest
Though tilled with all unrest
And molding crest-wise ever and again
New waters gathered in its wanderings
wide
Upon the ocean's breast.
Nay, not the clod alone,
The gross dense matter whereof worlds
are made,
Hath life beyond this life of light and
shade—
The form it clothes is deathless as God's
own
And was not born to fade.
What hand so cunning can destroy one
line
Of God's deep-wrought design?
Shatter the dew-drop globed upon the
grass—
The fragile globule Hies
To thousand atomies,
Yet each retains the outline of the mass
And sphered perfection lies.
Or loose a feathered arrow from its
place—
Thy straightening bow forgets its bended
grace;
But upward turn thine eye
And mark against the sky
Thy flying shaft the bow of beauty trace
The fair proportions of the Parthenon
Untouched by time live on.
The Coliseum's springing arches spread
Above thy reverent head.
What though worlds perish? Other
worlds shall sweep
Their paths appointed and their contours
keep. ■
What though men die? Espied or un
espied,
Somewhere their forms abide.
For though thou tread from us where
death unbars
The way, withdrawing thy dear face,
and though
We moan Not here! Not here! some
where we know
In lines of light outstreaming past the
stars
Thy living lineaments glow.
Death is but dissolution of life's bond.
For soul and Inxly strive a little space
To run together in the equal race,
Until one calls and one does not respond
And death bids both give place.
Body and soul go henceforth each his
way.—
Fair Helen was but is no more, we say;
And yet we know that somewhere
Helen's dust
Sleeps in the silent earth,
Or wakes to flower-bright birth,
Or panders still to man's insatiate lust.
And Helen's beauty, like a bale-fire set
On Skaian-portal, holds us spell-lnjund
yet.—

Beneath the pavement of Ravenna lies
All that remains of him whose bitter
fare
Of alien bread sustained him to endure
The apocalypse that blasts our weaker
eyes,
The human soul laid bare.
All that remains? Nay, Giotto's penciled
truth
Hath given over to immortal youth,
Unmarred by grief's and exile's signa
ture,
Fresh with life's morning-kiss,
The clear grave face that looked on Bea
trice.
And so he lives, dissevered soul and
sense.
Yet such dividual life were naught,
But that each poet's dower
Gives him creative power
To eke out nature's poor incompetence
And justify his hour.
For his transcendent vision recombinee,
Refining still away
What imperfections marked them for
decay,
The crumbling earth and lleshless pic
tured lines
Of Giotto's cunning. Yea,
Divining half from what the live hands
wrought
With impress large and strong,
And half from what the living accents
taught,
He pieces out the whole—
Conjecturing the soul
From the soul's deeds, the singer from
the song—
Till recreate, life's laurel round his head,
Lo Dante's self, immortal, perfected.
A poet's dream? Ay, so.
Yet who shall say or know
Bu to such supreme ends
All nature's travail tends?
Matter in countless forms we see,
Forms clothed in matter endlessly;
Each combination lives
What life its union gives
And dies because its bonds imperfect be.
Is it too strong a vision for men's eyes,
That struggle yet with tears,
To see, beyond their day of doubts and
fears,
On some far highland of the future rise
The crowning warrant of the laboring
years?
For such will rise, be sure—
A creature fair and pure,
A creature brave and bright,
Might with God's own might,
Made perfect to endure;
Wherein are met in marriage strong and
sweet,
What ever strive to meet,
Body and soul, each for the other made,
Each glad and unafraid,
Merged in one essence final and com
plete,
Self-centred, fed with free and painless
breath
And clear of time and ignorant of death.
Upon the new world's westward seaward
slope,
Where eager eyes catch color from the
dawn
And flash back radiance of half-risen hope,
Where life mny drink at founts still un
withdrawn
And breathe with respiration large and
free,
A marvel springs to meet the morning.
See,
Between the great sea's utn ost inland
surge
And rising hills that shelter from the sea.
In a glad land whose seasons melt and
merge
One into one and bring all wondrous
things
That sad lands wrest but from reluctant
springs,
All flower and fruitage of earth's largess,
stands
This latest wonder, as divine as they,
Albeit the fabric of weak human hands,
Clay shaped by kindred clay.

The hills deny it, not: dull red and gold
Againnt their vivid verdure and the blue
01 farther mountains rising fold on fold
Enrobed in haze of heaven's diviner hue;
The valley takes, as one that takes his
own.
These stately splendid simple walls of
stone,
Broad for the sunlight's blessing, low to
keep
Close fellowship with earth's great heart
alone •
Mute majesty of guardian towers, and
sweep
Of arcades gleaming afar in pillared pride,
And beauty ot binding arches multiplied.
Oh fair, surpassing fair, however viewed!
We marvel how these very stones disclose
The spirit of their builder's amplitude
And manhood's deep repose.
Ah, there is something here
More than these outlines clear—
Within this body some warm breath.
Some life within this stony death.
For faith and hope have builded here their
shrine
And wait here fora sign
That on some far horizon must appear: —
Hope that some watcher shall descry the
goal
Cfa'l this cosmic travail, faith profound
That knowledge does not tread one cease
less round
liut climbs from star to star and pole to
pole.
Mark then what threescore years and ten
may do.
For threescore years and ten ago was born
The child that into such large manhood
grew
As noon gets seldom promise of the morn
Ah that such manhood should be lost and
leave
Ilowed hearts t>f men and women here to
grieve
Where most he wrought. Yet here is
balm; for 10,
This same strong manhood taught us how
to weave
Joy of bereavement's very woof of woe,
Putting our manhood to the proof of tears
Where through hope's lainbow shines
across the years.
O mighty soul that trampled sorrow down,
Triumphant where the fallen are thickliest
strewed,
Receive this greater than a laurel crown,
Man's deathless gratitude.
Today we stand where thou canst stand
no more
As once thou stoodest, f-tand and sadly gaze
On all this relic ol thee, till before
Our griet finds words the grief is turned to
praise.
Ah sore tried heart that in its sorrow
turned
To one that with its own heart's-anguish
burned,
And gathered strength to quench the sor
row's fire;
Ah hands that faltered not when heart's
love yearned
For some memorial of its dead desire; —
How are men taught that death is not so
strong
But love may rescue something from his
wrong!
And thou, whose heart and hands so la
bored here,
From whose dead hope a thousand living
spring,
What song but song of praise should reach
thine ear
As love's high offering?
Here by thy steadfast crerd
That reach of human deed
Is bounded but by God's immense,
Immensurable benificence,
And by this stone memorial of thy trust
That man is more than dust,
We consecrate us to the work of need.
Here let us add our little to thy large,
Till mortal clay, molded to perfect form
And with the breath of God's own life
made warm,
Shall stand, godlike and fair, on heaven's
bright marge.
No life in lost, one says; no man's work
dies
Utterly; none that looks upon the skies
But leaves some record as secure as they
From death and death's decay.
Lo, this is fate. Put forth thy strong
hand where
Men lal>or in Time's garden-plot today,
Eternity shall find the impress there.
And haply this may be
But one says, Nay, there is nanglit that
abides.
Time is a wide unfathomable sea
'Neath whose recurrent tides
Are swallowed up all things implacably.
This rock-built earth whereof man makes
his home
Is less than the sea's foam;
The galaxies of stars that seem to him
Perdurable as time, like bubbles swim
Upon its surface and like them will burst;
Yea,time itself that swallows up all these
Must yield in turn, the last lost as the
first—
Must sink whence it arose,
Flow backward whence it Hows,
Into eternity's soundless shoreless seas.
What may be true? Is life less full or
fair,
Does deeper darkness gather o'er men's
eyes
Than when our fathers importuned the
skies
For light withliolden there?
The sun shines warm today as yesterday,
The green grass fails not when the rains

And ivy twines about the burial urn,
And summer winds through leattess
branches play,
Hearken, by day, by night, and thou
mayest hear
Ascending ever one unchanging tune,
The voice of all earth's choristers
a-croon,
The world-song low and clear.
No age hath listened for this song in
vain;
Though one voice dies another swells
the strain,
And Homer calls and Shakspere answers
Her el
And loss is balanced by unfailing gain.
Vet there is loss The splendid per
fumed rose
That blooms today within thy garden
close—
Ah, like it is but is not yet the flower
Thou wovest once in one fair maiden's
hair
To shed its perfume and its splendor
there
And crown love's supreme hour.
And though this rose as that be fair and
sweet,
Yea, though all rose-delights in this rose
meet,
Too well, too well thou knowest it hath
no power
Save in a mocking vision to recall
Youth's vanished festival.
Ay, there is loss Though rose return
for rose,
Somewhither each one goes
Nor comes again in its own form and hue;
And love that springs from dead love's
urned repose
Makes not the old joy new.
Ah for this transitory human life,
Where at the last all strivers cease from
strife
And over them and theirs is cast the
spell
Of death's Irrevocable!
Where unto them that have so nobly
striven
For heaven's best boon, behold what
boon is given:
A little time of hopes and joys and fears,
A little sound of music in their ears,
A little light upon their eyes and then
Darkness again.
Prayer shall avail not to avert this doom;
For man and all that man's hand
fashioneth
Shall find within the wide domain of
death
An unremembered tomb.

But hold ! The eyes of men
Made keen with penetrating through the

And justify his hour.
For his transcendent vision recombinee,
Refining still away
What imperfections marked them for
decay,
The crumbling earth and lleshless pic
tured lines
Of Giotto's cunning. Yea,
Divining half from what the live hands
wrought
With impress large and strong,
And half from what the living accents
taught,
He pieces out the whole—
Conjecturing the soul
From the soul's deeds, the singer from
the song—
Till recreate, life's laurel round his head,
Lo Dante's self, immortal, perfected.
A poet's dream? Ay, so.
Yet who shall say or know
Bu to such supreme ends
All nature's travail tends?
Matter in countless forms we see,
Forms clothed in matter endlessly;
Each combination lives
What life its union gives
And dies because its bonds imperfect be.
Is it too strong a vision for men's eyes,
That struggle yet with tears,
To see, beyond their day of doubts and
fears,
On some far highland of the future rise
The crowning warrant of the laboring
years?
For such will rise, be sure—
A creature fair and pure,
A creature brave and bright,
Might with God's own might,
Made perfect to endure;
Wherein are met in marriage strong and
sweet,
What ever strive to meet,
Body and soul, each for the other made,
Each glad and unafraid,
Merged in one essence final and com
plete,
Self-centred, fed with free and painless
breath
And clear of time and ignorant of death.
Upon the new world's westward seaward
slope,
Where eager eyes catch color from the
dawn
And flash back radiance of half-risen hope,
Where life mny drink at founts still un
withdrawn
And breathe with respiration large and
free,
A marvel springs to meet the morning.
See,
Between the great sea's utn ost inland
surge
And rising hills that shelter from the sea.
In a glad land whose seasons melt and
merge
One into one and bring all wondrous
things
That sad lands wrest but from reluctant
springs,
All flower and fruitage of earth's largess,
stands
This latest wonder, as divine as they,
Albeit the fabric of weak human hands,
Clay shaped by kindred clay.

The hills deny it, not: dull red and gold
Againnt their vivid verdure and the blue
01 farther mountains rising fold on fold
Enrobed in haze of heaven's diviner hue;
The valley takes, as one that takes his
own.
These stately splendid simple walls of
stone,
Broad for the sunlight's blessing, low to
keep
Close fellowship with earth's great heart
alone •
Mute majesty of guardian towers, and
sweep
Of arcades gleaming afar in pillared pride,
And beauty ot binding arches multiplied.
Oh fair, surpassing fair, however viewed!
We marvel how these very stones disclose
The spirit of their builder's amplitude
And manhood's deep repose.
Ah, there is something here
More than these outlines clear—
Within this body some warm breath.
Some life within this stony death.
For faith and hope have builded here their
shrine
And wait here fora sign
That on some far horizon must appear: —
Hope that some watcher shall descry the
goal
Cfa'l this cosmic travail, faith profound
That knowledge does not tread one cease
less round
liut climbs from star to star and pole to
pole.
Mark then what threescore years and ten
may do.
For threescore years and ten ago was born
The child that into such large manhood
grew
As noon gets seldom promise of the morn
Ah that such manhood should be lost and
leave
Ilowed hearts t>f men and women here to
grieve
Where most he wrought. Yet here is
balm; for 10,
This same strong manhood taught us how
to weave
Joy of bereavement's very woof of woe,
Putting our manhood to the proof of tears
Where through hope's lainbow shines
across the years.
O mighty soul that trampled sorrow down,
Triumphant where the fallen are thickliest
strewed,
Receive this greater than a laurel crown,
Man's deathless gratitude.
Today we stand where thou canst stand
no more
As once thou stoodest, f-tand and sadly gaze
On all this relic ol thee, till before
Our griet finds words the grief is turned to
praise.
Ah sore tried heart that in its sorrow
turned
To one that with its own heart's-anguish
burned,
And gathered strength to quench the sor
row's fire;
Ah hands that faltered not when heart's
love yearned
For some memorial of its dead desire; —
How are men taught that death is not so
strong
But love may rescue something from his
wrong!
And thou, whose heart and hands so la
bored here,
From whose dead hope a thousand living
spring,
What song but song of praise should reach
thine ear
As love's high offering?
Here by thy steadfast crerd
That reach of human deed
Is bounded but by God's immense,
Immensurable benificence,
And by this stone memorial of thy trust
That man is more than dust,
We consecrate us to the work of need.
Here let us add our little to thy large,
Till mortal clay, molded to perfect form
And with the breath of God's own life
made warm,
Shall stand, godlike and fair, on heaven's
bright marge.
