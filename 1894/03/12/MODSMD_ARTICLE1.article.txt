# OPENING OF THE BASEBALL SEASON.
## The 						Varsity Plays Poor Ball and Succumbs to Semi-Professionals. Saturday's Game with the Second Artillery. 
### 
The scni'-professional team of tlie
Second Artillery plays too perfect a
game for our team, whose complacent
self-confidence suffered i severe set
back from Saturday's game. The
fielding of the visitors was almost fault
less, while Walton's work at. first was
the only bright part of the game to the
Stanford crank.
Mertes, the first man to the bat, was
giveu a base ou balls A passed ball
advanced him to second; then Bumiller
dropped a third strike and threw wild
over first, letting Mertes score. In the
third inning Bumiller muffed a difficult
foul and the batstuau hit the next ball
out safely. He stole second, went to
third on a wild throw over second to
catch him, and scored on a hit by
Mertes. In the fourth inning Davey
let Smith's grounder get past him arid
Galindo, the ex-U. C etc. player,
brought him home by a single. Davey
missed an easy double-play in the nexr
inning, and two runs were scored before
the side was retired. From that, on!
McLaine was hit hard, and at no time
was the visiting team in danger of
being beaten.
Stanford's first run came in the
second inning: Walton hit for two
bases and Davey scored him by a single.
In the eighth Ilarrelson made a two
bagger and was scorcd by sacrifice hits !
by Sheehan and Lewis.
With such perfect support Devereux,
who is a first-class professional pitcher,
did not have to exert himself to win the
game. As it was the Stanford batting
was inexcusably light.
