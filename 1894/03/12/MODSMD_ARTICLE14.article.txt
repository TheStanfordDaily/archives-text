When visited for local news today,
Dr. Warner contributed the following
editorial from the Oakland Citizen:
Workingmeu, did you hear Prof.
Warner's solution of the reason why you
are unemployed? It is because you are
incapableâ€”because you have no right
to employment unless the class by whom
the Stanford University was founded
adjudge you capable and see fit to make
your labor profitable to themselves. It
is besides the question that this half
baked pedant would starve iu the ranks
of labor and that he is only maintained
in his chair at the Stanford University
because he is a willing and a subservient
tool of masters who pay him to preach
the lying gospel of plutocracy.
