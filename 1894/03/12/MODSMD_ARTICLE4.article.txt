In response to a call twenty seven
members of the once enthusiastic Rep
ublican Club met Thursday evening in
room 51, quadrangle. The object of
the meeting was then stated to be the
discussion of the proposition of sending
a delegate from Stanford to the conven
tion of the National College Republicans
at Syracuse, N. Y., on the Gth of April.
Heretofore, Stanford has sent a dele
gate each year to the convention. Real
izing the lack of political animation in
the University at this particular time of
the year when no large campaigns are
at hand it was the opinion of the meet
ing that some enthusiasm should be
aroused before any definite action be
taken in electing a delegate. After
some discussion of the subject it was
decided to open nominations for dele
gates and to hold them open until some
other meeting. Accordingly, Kimball
nominated L. Smith, '95, and Hazzard
nominated Purdue, gr., who is at pre
sent on a leave of absence canvassing
the state of Indiania as a candidate for
state geologist.
In accordance with a motion a com
mittee consisting of Guth, Brown, and
Rice was appointed to devise means of
securing in the near future several
prominent local Republicans to speak
before the Republicans of the Univer
sity. The club will meet this evening
