# That Cornell Affair.

The following extracts from u let
ter to the University Courier of U. P.
from an eye-witness of the recent Cor
nell trouble show the true state of af
fairs :
At Cornell the freshman banquet
has always been an unwritten challenge
to the sophomores to fry their mettle.
As the freshmen marched to tho ban
quet ha'l three hundred strong, guarded
by junior volunteers, a rush was made
upon them by the sophomores to break
their line and perhaps, if possible,to carry
off some freshmen, and thus prohibit
their attendance at the banquet. In both
these efforts they were unsuccessful
Two sophomores, however,were captured,
a few others were rescued from the pol
ice by their classmates, but ' here were
no ''stones or sticks thrown"; there was
no injury aside from soiled clothing,
due to old eggs After the assault the
sophomore class dispersed to their
homes, feeling as a body that the even
ing's proceedings were over. The
future developments were unexpected
by them.
About, 11:30 a strong smell of gas
was noticed in the kitchen, adjoining
the banquet hall, and used by the ca
terer. It drove everyone from the room.
Two holes in the floor beneath the table
gave the clue, which resulted in find
ing in an empty room under the kitchen
a stone jug, from which long tubes led
to the bored holes in the ceiling, and
this was the apparatus in which the re
action was working that furnished the
chlorine. Acolored woman had worked
at the table over the hol Q s Within an
hour it was reported that she was dead.
The students affected suffered great
pain that night, but all of them next
morning were at work.
The investigations for the culprits
have been unfruitful. It is untrue that
efforts are being made to suppress evi
dence Much indignation exists agaiust
some correspondents who sent out
highly colored reports.
