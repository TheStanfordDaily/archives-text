# Mr. Thoburn's Sermon: "Prayer."
## 
### 
"Whatever we ask we receive of Him
because we keep his commandments and
do those things that are pleasing in his
sight "
Such a subject I like to talk over
face to face, lor I often feel that it is
impossible to gather people together
ami teach them. With those who are
of your age, old landmarks are disap
pearing and you have not yet adjusted
yourself to the new mood. Things that
have had a halo about them have lost
that halo, and you do uot yet realize
that newer and better and deeper truths
received iu their place are yet more
holy and have in them more help for
you.
The university is a life of readjust
ment. Nothing is still except death
So when I hear that this student or
that is disturbed and beginning to have
doubts Lam glad that the old bark is
being split and that a new life and
growth is going on underneath.
Prayer is the heart of religion.
When we understand it fully we can
see that it is the whole activity of the
whole religious man. It has a special
relation to our university life. We are
I.ere exercising and developing our
minds and bodies aud, to some extent, our
spiritual life. But there is danger
of unsymetrical development. Some
times we find the intellectual develop
ment; sometimes we find the intellect
ual life overwhelming the physical and
religious. We find ourse ves forced to
surrender many cherished ideals of
youth. There is danger of it over
shadowing the spiritual aud the physi
cal. We live with our minds. The
perfect man has the body of a Hercules,
the mind of a Socrates, and the heart of
a John the Baptist.
I think the greater reason for nar
rowness in prayer is our effort to pray
beyond our belief. There a time
when the little prayer said at your
mother's knee satisfied every want in
your heart. But when reason comes to
over-shadow faith, faith dies, because
faith is wont to keep ahead of reasouâ€”
it is the skirmish line of your life.
Prayer is not spiritual gymnastics.
In this day it if a very tashionable
tiling to say that it merely views our
aspirations It does not even assume a
(iod. This threatens to become a form
ot modern theology. But this is making
religion a sham, and life cannot exist on
sham. Prayer that does not lead to
action is not prayer. How many people
pray for divers things and yet never
Miake any effort to get them. We ask
(tod to lead this or that friend into
righteousness, and in our walks with
that friend we always turn the conver
sation away from religious and ethical
subjects.
