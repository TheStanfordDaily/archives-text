# Compulsory Voting; Lecture by Mr. W. Fredrick Holls.
## 
### 
The subject upon which I shall pay a
few words is "Compulsory voting as a
remedy for some of the evils of politics."
The history which is yet to be written
of political legislation during the first
one hundred years of this government
will contain no chapter more instructive
and mote interesting than th it defining
and judging the changes in the law
made with reference to elections.
In olden times every voter in every
precinct was reasonably well known to
some of the crowd which from time im
memorial has stood round the polling
place. The voter went off to the bal
loting place where the judges stood, and
in a fearless voice announced his choice.
Voting by ballot was unknown fora
long time in our country's early history.

It was introduced on account of the
situation. Intimidation was resorted to:
hence the necessity ot the ballot, '''hen
the danger of repeating made registra
tion necessary. This is not universal.
Even in the United States if a voter
will swear in his ballot on election day
he may avoid registration. Next came
laws against bribery. The first blow
struck at that was when all ballots had
to be made uniform so that the briber
could have no guarantee thatthe bribed
person really voted as he was hired.
The last preventative is the Australian
ballot. These have made great reforms
for nobouy knows better than the
briber that a man who is mean euough
to sell his vote is mean enough to take
the money and vote the other ticket.
Originally voting was defined as the
"privilege of the ballot." It was a
privilege which distinguished its owner
from other less fortunate person- or
suffrage was not universal. Sovereigns
granted the right to vote with reluc
tance and to as few people as possible.
Mow voting is looked upon as a duty
rather than a privilege. How did this
come about.
The object with which a man should
go to the bal'ot box is one outside of
himself It is a maxim enforced by
; the severest sanctions of penal law that
a vote is not personal property. As
such it is not an object of bargain aud
sale. Even the offer to sell or offer to
buy is made hi - h ly criminal. Politi
cal ethics adds the rule that a vote
ought never to be cast from personal
motives—fear, revenge, spire, or to
please a powerful neighbor. The con
clusion follows with absolute force that
a vote is a trust, imposed upon those
who have a right to exercise it.and for
! the benefit not of themselves, but prim
arily for the whole community in which
I they live. What are the facts of the
exi rcise of this trust in this country?
I think all will agree with me that the
failue ot democracy—so far as there is
any —iu this country, is with respect to
its municipal governments. How far is
that failue due to the apathy of the men
who are trustees for themselves and
their neighbors?
Well, the figures are startling. In
New York iu IMO there was a great
effort to throw off the yoke of Tam
many Hall. A. coalition ticket, made
up of all the factions opposed to Tam
many, was nominated. The best citi
zens of all parties supported it. Tam
many Hall nominated a typical member.
Thirty-five thousand voters in the
city of New York who took the
trouble to register did not vote. It
was a rainy, disagreeable morning, that
election day. It is estimated 50,000
more who were entitled to vote did not
take the pains to register. There wire
Hs,(!o'> voters who withheld votes at
j that election.
Tammany Hall won the election by
15.0U0 majority. Now it is not neces
sary for me to go into details to show
j you how thoroughly Tammany Hall is
[organized. But it is not a stretch to
say that out of those 85,000 non-voteis
not. 5.000 were Tammany men. It fol
lows with absolute certainty that
80 000 citizens staid at home who, if
they had gone to the polls, would have
voted for good government.
In the judiciary election of Chicago
in 1891, 44,000 votes were cast It is
perfectly safe to say that 150,000 voters
were in the city Less than one third
of the voters voted.
You will find that the majority of
the successful candidates is very rarely
more than two or three per cent, of the
entire vote cast. Now our respcct for
an election as a decision of the people,

I and as such entitled to the acquiesenee
of every good eizen, must be enormously
lessened. Moreover, it is a very sig
nificant fact that the class of voters who
ahstuin arc by uo means the worst class.
The political heeler and all his class
I are at the polls all day long. It is the
intelligent class, usually the wealthy
class, very often the cultured classes,
! who feel contamination with ''the dirty
politicians" They are the ones who
stay away.
Now if there is any efficient remedy
for this short of compulsion, it has not
yet been suggested. I think further
reflection on this will show us that we
are, in a political sense, in the position
we were in in 1863, when volunteering
had slopped and the war had to be car
ried on by drafts.
Now a law to remedy this must be
practical. It would declare it the duty
of every voter to vote at the next-com
ing state election; and furthermore, he
could uot vote then unless he had voted
| at the next, previous state election. If,
however, he had been sick at that elec
; tion or were otherwise compelled to be
j absent, he should be required to make
a written affidavit stating the cause of
his failure to vote and tile it with the
election officers a sufficient time before
. election.
So if a man stays at home because it
it is raining, or it is too much trouble
to ti'>, there will be enough inconven
ience attached to his voting next year
to make it worth his while to go now.
If this affidavit, proved flimsy, fine the
man. We can count on the rival party
I examining this affidavit. If the next
| year he did not vote, the fine ought to
be continued. If for five years he had
not voted the law should, in my opinion,
disfranchise him completely, except
after going through some process in
court which should be expensive and
annoying. People who are disfran
! chised, moreover, would make a most
excellent class upon whom to impose a
burden in the shape of some tax.
Now let us examine the advantages
of such a law. First, it would be ef
fective and practical. I think everyone
wants to vote sometimes. Disfranchise
ment will not he very pleasant to any
body who has ever breathed American
air. If that time ever comes when
there is no sense of shame for being de
prived of a ballot, then the Kepublic
is in danger indeed.
Second, wc would for the first time
get an expression of the real popular
will.
Third, it would diminish corruption.
The most plausible pretense upon which
great sums of money can be secured by
the party manager is "to get out the
vote." The rich contributors in the
cities, who no longer are moved by
general reasons, are always touched :
when the politician comes and sa)s
'•You know we have to get out the vote
in the country."
A fourth result would be the in
creased impulse fjiven to political edu
cation. As we have seen, most of the
people who do not vote belong to the
intelligent class. They are much ab
sorbed in their work; they have no time
to know about politics. If, however,
they know that they have to vote they
would want to knew what they were
voting for and whom. This would 1
cause them to attend the primaries ond
here we would have that vexing prob-I
lem removed.
Nearly the most important conse
quencewould be the opportunity it would
grant to us to reform our municipal pol
itics. In every one of our cities the
"machine" is in a small minority. I
That great force now lying unused, if |

forced to vote, would soon put au end
to the "machine" in every city
of our country.
Hat the most important result is this:
The inculcating of the idea of duty into
the minds of American citizens, rather
than that of privileges.
