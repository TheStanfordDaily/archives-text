# The 						Oratorical Contest.
## 
### 
The following letter was received this
morning from Berkeley in answer to
the challenge sent to them to compete
for the Examiner prize of $100. A
copy of the challenge was sent to the
Hastings Law School, as an affiliated
college of the U. C. No word has
been received from them, but it is prob
bable that they will accept the chal
lange if Berkeley does not.
Berkeley. March 11, 1894.
Messrs. Brocks, Hrown, and Wilson,
Stanford University.
Gentlemen.—Your communication of
the Bth instant was read before the As
sociated Students' meeting on Friday
the 9th. It was at the close of the
hour, and consequently the measure
was not discussed as fully as might be
desired, but the whole matter was re
ferred to the debating union for con
sideration as before. There was at the
former meeting a strong sentiment in
favor of referring all matters concerning
debating and oratorical contests to afore
said union. This being the case the
student body, having delegated its
authority, can not now act in the first
instance. However much we mij;ht
desire to arrange for such a meet, we
are now compelled to refrain.
All further communication will nec
essarily be with the officers of the de
bating union.
ours very respectfully,
liuss Avery.
