The announcement comes from
Ruble that their reception will be giveu
on Friday instead of Saturday in ordei
that there shall he no attraction besides
the inter-society debate Saturday eveu

debaters. But then there are other at
tractions on Friday. The courtesy of
Roble Hall should not be abused in this
way. When invitations are sent out it
is the worst possible taste for any sec
tion ot the student body to insinuate a
change of the date for their especial
benefit
