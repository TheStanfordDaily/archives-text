It is to be deplored tliat our leading
dailies can resort to such dishonorable
means for filling their columns as the
Examiner did yesterday, under the
guise of "newspaper enterprise." By
publishing Prof. Harrison's leeture
verbatim as delivered Monday that pa
per has not only violated its word given
to the contrary, but has inlriugod upon
the rights of the lecturer as an Ameri
can citizen. His words belong to the
public only in so far as they come from
bis lips. Any use to which they might
subsequently be put, should in all
equity be subject to the approval of
their author. Judging from the ap
plause following the lecturer's remarks
upon this subject, yesterday, it is safe
to say that the student body will do all
in its power to see that such a flagrant
discourtesy is not perpetrated again.
