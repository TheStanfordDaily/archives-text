### 
The committee on declamation has
not received many entries for the 820
prize contest. Tlje contest prob
ably take place on the Tuesday evening
following Kaster vacation. It is to be
a strictly declamation affair, no origin
ality of composition being required,
although it will not be objected to. The
length of the pieces will be limited to
750 words. President Jordan will
probably name three judges to decide
the contest. If more than twelve en
tries are received a preliminary contest
will be held before the judges alone, to
eliminate the poorest speakers. Hand
your name to Miss Chapman, Scott
Calhoun, or T. II Warren, before Fri
day evening, the 16th.
