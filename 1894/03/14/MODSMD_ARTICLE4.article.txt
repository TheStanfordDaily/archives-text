# First Meeting of the Stanford Press Club.
## 
### 
The Stanford Press Club held its
firHt regular meeting last Thursday
evening in room 21, quadrangle In
addition to the charter members of the
club over a dozen vinitor.s were present
to listen to the exercises of the open
meeting.
In substance Prof. Lathrop, who was (
the iirst speaker, said: None have been 1

less identified with journalism than I.
My connection with the press is that I
have a brother who is a reporter on the
Boston. Herald, aud that I am ac
quainted with the crimes editor of a
New York paper. I was once engaged
tor a week as a reporter on trial, and
that week was all that, was required of
me. With the exception of the Daily
Palo Alto I read no daily, and no
weekly except Authur McEweii's Letter
and the Sequoia.
The first need of a reporter is a good
liberal education: that is to say, an
ability to deal intellectually with such
problems as come up before a mau in
any field of labor. It is a mistake to
suppose that training in one department
of mental labor furnishes us with ability
in all departments. The ability to know
and to love whatever is good aud beau
tiful in life is essential to everyone,
reporter as well. A man that keeps
himself abre>st of life as well as his vo
cation must be a mau as well as an
efficient thing.
A reporter needs to know the scien
tific method; he needs knowledge of
the literature; he needs knowledge of
politics and orgauized human life He
must be able to talk with a bishop, a
blacksmith, with au actor, with a crim
inal. He should not be a hardened
man of the world but a, man alive to all
the highest aspirations. The habit of
writing is mental discipline.
Professor Woodruff, following the
humorous introduction with which
Prof. Luthrop had prefaced his remarks,
said:
My first impression of this club and its
purpose was associated with the object
of press clubs generally, which seems to
devote much attention to social func
tions and to a good dinner; but noticing
the broad field ot operation that was
outlined in the announcement of its
formation I was. like the small boy who
put twenty-seven eggs under the turkey
hen, perfectly willing to see her spread
her.-elf. However, when I was invited
to speak before the club I took occasion
to see that material benefit might re
sult from the organization.
My newspaper experience has been
very meagre. As a small boy 1 some
times earned as much as thirty-six
cents a week folding papers fora country
weekly, and all that amount I usually
spent in riotous pleasures, as is custom
ary with newspaper men. As editor
in-chief of the Cornell Magazine I suc
ceeded in antagonizing all the profes
sors. And so 1 rose, step by step, un
til I became faculty member of the
board of control of the Sequoia.
I can see in this organization oppor
tunities for mutual helpfulness in con
nection with the University papers.
In the last few years college weeklies
and dailies have greatly improved. The
monthly has improved far more. I
believe that I voice the sentiments of
the faculty in saying that the Daily
Palo Alto is the best college daily in
the United States.
Upon the correspondents in the Uni
versity of the city dailies rests the
great responsibility of properly repre
senting the University. Exaggerations
and untruths emanating from them
should be cried down The recent Cor
nell affair and the way it was exagger
ated to the world is an example of such
action on the part of the studeut corres
pondents.
The modern university graduate as a
man of intelligence is given the prefer
ence in the big newspaper offices.
Prof. Hudson said he had been a
press man in England and once in
tended to make journalism his profes
sion, but that he knew little of the

working of the American papers. After
speaking of some ot his personal exper
iences in London journalism, and in
timating that he would furnish more of
them at some other time, he spoke upou
the subject of journalism.
The need of the day is for the news
paper press to come into the hands of
large, nohle intentioned, educated, in
telligent men —men who look beyond
sensationalism. My experience with
newspaper men in London is that
they have »reat intellectual flexibility
and elements of moral indifference.
We do need educated men on news
papers, men in touch with the science,
art, and literature of the day. A broad
intellectual outlook and strong personal
character, are necessary to a successful
future newspaper man.
The ordinary press club is an organ
ization for social purposes almost en
tirely; this should be one for mutual
improvement.
Nothing can ever be foreign to the
interests and work of a reporter.
One of the greatest gifts of a reporter
is the ability to selcct the pith of a
speech.
Later in the evening the club held a
private session at which by-laws were
adopted and other business transacted.
