# Newspaper Theft of Prof. Harrison's Lectures.

### 
As a prelude to his lecture yesterday
' General Harrison said:
Ladies and Gentlemen: Mr. Joseph
J Cook and other notable lecturers some
( times indulge themselves in what they
call a prelude, aud some preachers also
have the habit. I do not intend to
adopt the habit; but will indulge myself
i this afternoon in a few words Some
|of our newspaper friends have greatly
! exercised themselves over the question,
j "What shall we do with our ex-Presi
i dents?" It is a question that has never
I troubled me much, and I have never
i felt called upon before to offer a solu-
I tion; but, in .view of an experience jes
; terday, I venture to offer this solution,
which will be perfect so far as I am con
: cerned: Do not steal what belongs to
them. That will answer all require
ments in my case.
As you all kuow, I came here to de
liver these lectures upon the invitation
and at the cost of Stanford University.
They were not public lectures They
were intended for the students of this
University, and especially for the classes
;in law, political science, and history.
There being some desire on the part of
others to attend these lectures, or a
part of them, President Jordan enlarged
the invitation so as to admit some of
our friends from the outside. It was
especially announced at the beginning
and by me directly to at least one of
! the newspapers which has violated the
! courtesies of the occasiou, that the lec
tures would not be published; that they
j wer3 not in shape for publication, and
that I would not consent to newspaper
j publication as the lectures proceeded.
This rule, which was known, and which
! I think is obligatory upon every gentle
j man who enters the hall, was yesterday
by evasive and clandestine methods
avoided, and a publication was at
tempted. Such publications, not re
vised by the author, are sure to be full
of mistakes that are mortifying to the
lecturer aud misleading to those who
read them.
1 have no general assault to make
upon the newspaper representatives as a
body. I have met with many courtes
ies at their hands and my relations with
them have been generally very pleasant.
Kut this matter, young ladies and gen
tlemen of Stanford University, is en
tirely in our control, and for the future
I appeal to your loyalty to me and to
this institution to see that this business
is not repeated. 1 shall not only not
regard it, as an interruption, but 1 will
be especially r obliged to any one who
will call to my attention or that of the
ushers the presence of any one who is
attempting to violate the very reasonable
request that the lecture be not reported
for publication. | Applause.] I have not
I such an estimation of these lectures my
self as to think that grand larceny could
be predicated of the stealing of them,
but such property as there is in them
I is mine.
