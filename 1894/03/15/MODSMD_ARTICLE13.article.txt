The proposition that the student
body apply the thirty dollars subscribed
for the benefit of the iMidwinter Fair
to the purchase of a large banner is
farcical. One who knows anything
about the price of flags and banners
knows that nothiug but a very shoddy
article can be purchased for thirty or
even forty dollars. To present to the
Fair on Stanford day a cheap farmer's
satin flag would be to insult the Fair
management and bring down upon our
selves the derision of everyone. Dur
ing the hard times the Fair would ap
preciate the cash itself much more than
any flag we are in a condition to pur
chase .
