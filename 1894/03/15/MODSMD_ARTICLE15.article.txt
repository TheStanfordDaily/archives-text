This University does not. require a
Stanford day at the Fair to advertise
itself. Its fame already far exceeds any

impression that might be produced by
such a display as could be arranged in
the short time that remains before
March 23d. What we do need, how
ever, now that a Stanford day has been
set and made known to the public
through the press, is a large
attendance of students upou that
occasion.
Comparatively few Stanford students
have visited the Fair thus far because no
occasion has taken them to San Fran
cisco in a body, but the 23d of March,
declared a holiday by the University
for the very purpose of allowing the
students and members of the faculty to
have an opportunity to see the exhibit
of the Midwinter Exposition, bhould be
a day for this whole community to take
advantage of the low rates, the com
panionship of familiar associates, and
the suspension of recitations and attend
in an enthusiastic body, ;
Several practicable suggestions as to
features that the students might them
selves furnish were made at the meeting
of the Associated Students this after
noon. What Herkeley will do on her
day can be seen in another column.
