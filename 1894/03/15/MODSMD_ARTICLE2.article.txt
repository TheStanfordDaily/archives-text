The financial problem is becoming
jne ul increasing importance to tlic As

sociated Students. Stanford day at
the .Midwinter Fair is only a week dis
tant and there is no money in the treas
ury to meet, even preliminary expenses.
Decorations wil' have tube provided for
and the expenses of the musicians paid.
The various committees acting at pre
sent, have advanced money from their
private funds, and there is Sl'- 50 due
towards making up the declamation
prize.
Students are proverbially poor, but
surely no one can object to contributing
a small amount toward the above laud
able purposes.
Zion, president of the student body,
announces that unless some action is
taken on the matter at tomorrow's meet
ing, he will place it before the Execu
tive Committee.
