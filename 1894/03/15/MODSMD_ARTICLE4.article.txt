The football players of the University
received today the following letter from
Walter Camp, which has been sent to
all old players:
Enclosed is a brief statement of the
work undertaken by an old Oxonian
at a time when charges against boating
in England were even more serious than
tho.se against footh ill now in our coun
try. With the co-operation of those of
us who are old players it seems possible
at this time to perform a similar work
for American college football as did Mr.
John Morgan in 1873 for English uni
versity rowing.
The captains of our old teams have
gladly written quite fully in reply to
questions, and if the individual players
will, on behalf of the game, sacrifice
enough time to write something of their
experience in answer to the enclosed
questions, the results will be well worth
laying before the college world. The
writer lully appreciates the fact that lit
is asking much of a man to request him
to do this, but relying upou the fact
that the old football men have always
stood together in defense of the sport,
be hopes that, you will favor us with an
answer sometime during the coming
week or ten days
The questions to be answered are:
How many years did you play?
What was the most serious injury
you received?
Was that injury permanent?
Was it received in a match or in
practice?
Had you been properly trained?
