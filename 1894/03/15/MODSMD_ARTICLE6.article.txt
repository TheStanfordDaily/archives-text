The Varsity baseball team went to
San Mateo this afternoon in Paulsen's
rockaway to play a practice game with
the nine of St. Matthew's School. The
following men composed the team: Bu
â€¢niller, catcher; Weldon, pitcher; Wal
ton, Ist base; l>avey, 2d base; Dyer,
3d base; Lewis, s. s; Calhoun, 1. 112;
Sheehan, c. 112; and C. Downing, r. 112.
Owing to the fact that St. Matthew's
regular pitcher is out of form, McLaine,
who pitched for the team for several
years when preparing for college, oc
cupied the box against the Varsity this
alternoou. Stuart, '05, officiated as
manager in the absence of Cox.
This game was rather hurriedly ar
ranged, no notification of it having ben
made until after 5 o'clock yesterday
evening, when this paper had gone to
press.
