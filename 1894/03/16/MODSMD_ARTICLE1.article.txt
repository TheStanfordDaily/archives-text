# The
						Promenade Concert.
## 
### 
The program for the promenade con
cert to be given by the Baud Siturday
night has been made out, and consists
almost entirely of selections that have
never been heard here before. It is
necessarily somewhat informal because
of the uncertainty as to the length of
time available afier the debate,
although it it the intention to begin it
about 8:15, continuing an hour and a
half or two hours. Fortunately the
quadrangle is commodious enough to
accommodate everyone, no matter how
large the attendance.
