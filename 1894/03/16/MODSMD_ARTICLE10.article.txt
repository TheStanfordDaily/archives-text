The immense army of the unem
ployed now moving o'i to Washington
may be a source of great danger not
only to that city but to the Ciuse of
labor as well. Mobs are hard to gov
ern. A lew hot beaded individuals
may at any time start riots which will
bring the blush of shame to the cheeks
of every true American citizen, and
alienate the sympathy now felt for the
unemployed Besides this there is
certain to be great destruction of prop
erty along the line of march, for like an
invading army, these men will live oft
the country through which they pa.*s
From Washington they will disperse
over the entire Atlantic coast and it
may be years before the balance in the
labor world is so restored that each
section of the country bears its own
share of the burden as equably as at
present. The good such a demonstra
tion will do is not apparent so far as
influence on congress is concerned, for
no particular act of legislation is being
urged by the army as a unit, because of
the necessarily contending and clash'ng
opinions of the men composing it.
