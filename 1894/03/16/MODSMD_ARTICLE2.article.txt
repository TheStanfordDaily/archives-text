# Prof. Lathrop's Lecture: "The Prince of Liars."
## 
### 
A crowded chapel greeted Prof.Lathrop
Tuesday evening to learn who was the
prince of liars, lie interspersed his
remarks with several humorous selec
tions from the writings of the man who
furnished the theme of his interesting
discourse —Daniel De Foe.
You have, no douht, often heard the
proverb, "As easy as lying"; but if any
of you have ever tried to lie steadily,
consistently, and conscientiously, you
are well aware that if is by no means as
easy as it seems. Able liars are great
geniuses in their line. You will there
fore listen with interest to the account
of a man who deserved the title of the
greatest liar in the world.
I refer to Daniel De Koe, the author

of "Robinson Crusoe." His was indeed
a stirring life, lie was sixty years of
age when he wrote "Robinson Crusoe,"
and had been a rebel, merchant, manu
facturer, a prisoner in Newgate, secre
tary to five different administrations,
engaged in secret service by different
political parties, lie died in penury.
Like nearly all the English Dis
senters be took up anus with Mon
mouth's troops in l'iBs He then trav
elled on the continent, and, upon his
return to England, earned the sobri
quet of "The Sunday Gentleman," tor
in that day. when no one could be ar
rested outside of his house for avoiding
creditors, he appeared as a fashionably
dressed gentleman
De Foe was closely identified with
nearly all the political intrigues of his
time, and in IGO7 he spent four months
in Edinburgh as an agent for promoting
the union between Scotland and Eng
land. But the death of King William
and the accession of Queen Anne
brought, degradation and disappoint
ment to De Foe.
A political pamphlet issued under the
auspices of Queen Anne's reign had the
disastrous result of throwing him into
prison, there to lie during the queen's
pleasure While he was in prisou he
actually began the publication of a
paper, I'fte Review, which he pub
lished single handed for eight years.
Me was eventually released from prisou
on the condition that he should keep
silence thereafter, but no sooner was he
released than he formed secret relations
with the great government leaders, and
f-»r twenty three years led a life of
deception before the English people.
Hut you should not gain the impres
sion that De Foe's political ends were as
immoral his political means. He
hau constantly in mind the welfare of
the public and proposed several social
and educational reforms, such as bank
ruptcy laws, branch banks, military
academies, and educational institutions
for women.
De Foe was one of the first journal
ists in the world. His paper was not
merely a political pamphlet but con
tained news, editorials, and such stories
as he could rake up from about London, j
But not having the facilities for obtain
ing stories and news that the modern re
porter enjoys he often ran short. In
such cases he made up stories so life
like that they were taken for truth.
Whenever a man died De Foe always
had his biography ready to print The
ingenious methods that he often em-,
ployed to get the material for these
amusing pictures are as amusing as the
pictures themselves
N i library in the whole world pos-j
sesses a complete edition of his writ
ings. which comprise in all 254 vol
umes, covering nearly every field of
literature A little book of his, called
the "Complete English Tradesman," is
still published anew and referred to by
the commercial world.
To me his "Robinson Crusoe" por- \
trays the Angle-Saxon nature in a mas
terly manner. Crusoe never folds bis '
arms, never plays trag dy. He builds
a ship though it takes him two years to
move it to thu water. He plants a for- j
est before the door of his cave. In the
evolution of his lonely life on the is- I
land is seen the forces that moulded
the character and the nature of the
Anglo-Saxon race.
De Foe's career came to a close in a
hired lodging where he bad taken re
fuge from his creditors and enemies. I
do not agree with those who say he
deserved this kind of death, for Daniel
De Foe was a defender of William 111.
and the author of "Robinson Crusoe." j

Second Day of the Tennis Tournament.
There was much interest manifested
in the second day's tennis tournament
on the campus. A large crowd congre
gated about the courts anxious to see
the outcome of the preliminaries, as it
bad been rumored about that there
would be some hard fights. Nor had
any one's expectations been raised to
too high a pitch. All played with a
viui, and no game was won but after a
determined contest. In the singles for
the third round the sits were as follow:
