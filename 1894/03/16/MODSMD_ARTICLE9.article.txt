It is a j>reat pity that there is no way
by which the song birds on the Univer
sity esiate can be protected from the
inroads of murderous pot-hunters and
would-be sportsmen. Thy estate seems
to be too 1 to be watched by special
watchmen, and so it becomes overrun
with outside hunting parties each tine
day. Larks, robins, orioles, everything
thut lives, constitute the helpless targets
of these butchers, and in many cases
are left lying where they fall, useless to
those who kill them after having satis
fied their love for slaughter. If some
way could be devised by which students
could be invested with authority, much
of the vandalism might be stopped.
