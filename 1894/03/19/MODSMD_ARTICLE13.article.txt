Since it has been decided that we
are to have a local oratorical contest,
it should be a contest in fact as well as
in name. The date of the contest has
been fixed by the Associated Students,
and tomorrow night set as the limit lor
entries. Kvery student who aspires to
a career of public speaking and who
feels that he has some present ability
in that line should give his name to one
of the committee before the entries
close. A large number of entries will
necessitate a preliminary contest,
thereby insuring a higher standard in
the final one. Little honor will accrue
to the winner of the prize unless he
can be regarded as actually the best
orator of the entire University.
