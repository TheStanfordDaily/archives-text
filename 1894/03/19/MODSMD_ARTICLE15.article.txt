The faculty has decided upon the
rather novel course of placing this year's
aud subsequent memorial exercises to be
held May 14, the anniversary of the
birth of him whose name the Univer
sity bears, wholly in the hands of the
students. Aud with this object in view
a faculty committee consisting of Profs.
Hudson and Woodruff will soon select
two students to furnish the literary part
of the program. The various student
musical organizations will probably be
asked to contribute to the program of
that evening.
The addition of Founders' Day, the
9th of March, as an occasion on which

I the faculty has and will take part in
the memorial exercises, is the principal
i reason for leaving the observance of the
i anniversary of the son's birth in charge
of the students.
We will await with interest the ap-
I pointment of those to be honored by
j the faculty recognition.
