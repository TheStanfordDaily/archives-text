previous to the Faster vacatiot. a severe
case of pleurisy, which unnoticed had
been slowly developing for several
weeks, compelled liiin to leave the Uni
versity. No one believed but that in a
few weeks at the most he would be aide
to resume his studies, for his large,
strong physique and youth seemed to
contradici all thoughts of a serious ill
ness. But pit urisy was followed by
pneumonia, which develop* d into con
sumption.
A few weeks ago lie was moved from
Sjiii Francisco to Pasadena in hopes
that a change to a milder climate might
effect what the best medical treatment
had failed to do.

big, generous-hearted, congenial boy;
an athlete, and a musician.
