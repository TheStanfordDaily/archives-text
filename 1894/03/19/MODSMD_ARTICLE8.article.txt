### 
Mr. Herbert. Miller, principal of tlie
Stockton High School, gave the Sun
day morning lecture yesterday, of
which the following is a synopsis
Some of the sweetest and uiost de
lightful dreatns of men have been sug
gested by the name of Heaven, where
it is thought the presence of God is
more fully realized than upon earth;
where lie will be seen with spiri ual
eyes; where lie will talk with spiritual
worshippers, who will bless him forever.
This is the general idea of Heaven pre
valent among Christian believers.
liui the more science investigates
the structure of this wonderful Para
dise the less definite its outlines be
come. It is plain to see wheuce came
the present idea, if we examine the
early ideas prevalent in the primitive
minds of men. It is a gradual evolu
tion from the rudest barbaric visions
up through the poetic ideas of Dante
and Milton to oar present conception.
We have found that if has been located
upon a mountain, at the foot of a pre
cipice, in the sea, in the west, in the
south, under the earth, in the sun, in
the planets, in the sky; and from every
place it has fled before the advancing
light of knowledge. 'Hie compass of

the voyager has driven it from the face
of the earth; the hammer of the geolo
gist, from beneath the earth; before the
telescope of the astronomer it vanishes
into unfathomable space. It is foolish
to think that anything of value ever
disappears. This is a waking hour
from dreams and visions to the cer
tainty of knowledge. Heaven has
been pictured as the home of the soul.
For untold millions of miles we look
through space and discover that home
nowhere. Of the future existence of
that home there is no proof. That the
soul or the intellect is individually im
mortal we have absolutely no proof.
Death is but a deeper unconsciousness
than sleep; we do not perish but chauge
our form and live on as we have lived.
The universe is our heaven. We have
been in many parts of it, upon many
planets We are destined yet to be in
many other parts of it.
The ideal thought of perfect happi
ness as consistent with Paradise is only
reached when the concrete difference
between wish and happiness is reduced
to a minimum, and is constant and ab
solute. Heaven is but a palace for the
imagination Personal unconsciousness
after death is the dearest wish of over
400,(100.000 of the earth's people.
The more we know and follow the
laws of the infinite the larger part are
we of that infinite. The day we come
to die we are a part of it, never to be
separated from it.
