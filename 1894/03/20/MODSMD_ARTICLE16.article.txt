An effort is being made by the men
who have always beeu energetic in hold
ing up the reputation of athletics here
to obtain sufficient funds to put the run
ning tracks in shape so that our field
athletes can train tor some of the com
ing events. To do this funds are nec
essary. Everyoue should be willing to
subscribe tor such a purpose, and a
ready response should be given to those
who are making collections for this pur
pose. Cinders will have to be brought
from some outside source, since those to
be had on the campus are to large aud
do not ram into a compact track.
