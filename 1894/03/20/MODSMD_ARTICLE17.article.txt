Today is published the constitution
of the recently organized Japanese
Club. It is an organization that will
undoubted!) be of very great service in
the training of its members to speak
clearly and fluently. One good feature
in the constitution and that indicates a
generous spirit in the promoters is the
eligibility to membership of every Jap
anese on the campus. The club is also
to invite an American student to act as
official critic for the club; this is a novel
idea and will be of the greatest service
to its members. We wish this addition
to Stanford clubdom a useful and suc
cessful career.
