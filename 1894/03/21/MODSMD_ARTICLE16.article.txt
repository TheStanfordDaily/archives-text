All uneasiness over the possible
failure of the juniors to have their ac
customed hop has been dispelled. The
day is finally settled and all preparations
are being made needful to make the
affair a success. The nearness of the
day set apart is a surprise to most, but
on the whole it is better to have the
event occur before the press of work
begins for examinations. The day is
to be a Varsity holiday, and is to be de
voted to junior celebrations. This is a
precedent that succeeding classes will
not be slow to follow.
The couimittoe having this event in
charge are to bo congratulated on the
success of their preliminary work, and
tor being able to start the custom here
of having a regular junior day as is
customary at most of the eastern col
leges.
