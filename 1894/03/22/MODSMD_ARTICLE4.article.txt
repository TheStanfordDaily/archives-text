# Registration Fees.
## 
### 
Before the opening of the debate on
Tuesday evening President Jordan made
the announcement that next year the
students will pay a registration! fee
each semester. This, he explained, in
no wise indicates a reversal of the policy
of affording 112 ee tuition, but is a method
of securing student cooperation in pro
viding certain necessary facilities and
equipment which the University is not
prepared to undertake so long as its
fut.ds are tied up by the courts. The
announcement in the forthcoming Reg
ister, under the head of "expenses of
the students" is as follows:
"Tuition in all departments of the
University is free. In 1894-95 all
graduate students, except regularly ac
eepted candidates for advanced degrees,
and all undergraduate students, will be
charged a registration fee often dollars
per semester, payable on registration;
and all special students a registration
fee of fifteen dollars per semester, pay
able on registration. In addition, stu
dents in laboratory courses pay for the
materials which they use. The de
posits required in advance are different
for different courses, ranging from two
to twenty dollars per semester."
