# A 						Latin Play by Harvard.
## 
### 
Much interest will bo felt by students
of literature, and especially ol the clas
sics, in the Latin play to be given by
the Harvard College in April. The
play chosen is the "I'hormio'' of
Terence, which was selected as the
most likely to suit a modern taste.
Work uu the "Phormio" began last
'all, and preparations ltave been made
to have every detail a faithful reproduc
tion of the Latin theatre. In Terence's
own time there were no theatre build
ings in Home, but his comedies were
often revived later, and tbe present per
formance will follow as closely as possi
ble the customs of tbe Augustan age.
Musical accompaniments have been pre
pared which follow the rhythm of the
Latin verses and are played on two
clarionets.
