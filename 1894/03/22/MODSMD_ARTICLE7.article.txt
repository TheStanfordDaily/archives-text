# The
						Student Guild.
## 
### 
The organization perfected some few
weeks ago has been at work in the
quiet way that is the only effective
method of accomplishing its purpose.
Recently Prof. Griffin was elected
chairman of the Guild; Miss Stolten
berg, '96, (house president of Roble)
secretary; Cochran, '9(3, treasurer In
addition to the officers Prof. Thoburn
and E. I). .Magee, '95, compose the
executive committee of five.
The principal purpose of the Guild is
to provide students wishing employment
a reliable and confidential bureau of in
formation.
It. is also the purpose of the organiza
tion to ascertain all cases that from time
to time may arise of students who may be
unfortunate enough to be taken ill dur
ing a financial emergency and when
neither immediate friends nor relatives
are near at hand to render proper care
and attention.
The committee will have to depend
upon the members of the student, body
to come promptly forward and notify
one of their number when such cases
exist. Prof Griffin, as chairman, and
the other members of the committee
will observe the strictest confidence in
all matters of a personal arid private
nature which may be presented to them
in connection with the work of the
Guild.
