# Two Baseball Victories at the Midwinter Fair.
## 
### 
The Game with the Olympic Maroons.
The baseball game between the Var
sity and the Olympic Maroons on the
afternoon of Stanford Day at the Mid
winter Pair was stopped at the etid of
the fifth inning, but only soon enough
to put an end to the already terrible
slaughter of the O'yinpic Maroons
Davey caught a sure game as YVeldou's
backstop. His arm was strong as
is evidenced by the fact that the
Olympic Maroons did not secure a
single stolen base Only two hits were
secured off the freshman twirler, one of
which landed in the clump of trees in
the right field, being otherwise a sure
out for Calhoun.

The St Ignatius College Nine Out
CLASS hi)
Last Saturday afternoon the second
appearance of the Stanford nine before
a Midwinter Fair crowd was made with
a repetition of the former one-sided
score. St. Ignatius College was the
team to fall a victim to thtir own fum
bles and the exceptional team work of
our nine.
It was Children's Day at the Fair and
fully 12,000 spectators occupied the
grand stand, fora field day was in pro
gress at the same time.
Still so few Stanford men were present
that it was impossible to fill a vacancy
in the team with a Stanford student
The regular Varsity battery arid the
first baseman were absent. Jack Shee
han's young brother filled the place of
the missing man.
Following is the tale of the game, to
gether with the positions to which our
men were changed:
