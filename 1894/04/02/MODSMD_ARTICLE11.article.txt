# Students Repair the Oval.
## 
### 
Under the supervision of Cletnans,
<;r , and Wilson, '94, a number of stud
ents appeared early last Monday morn
ing with hoes, rakes, and shovels and
commenced work ou the track. They
were divided into gangs, each of which
worked on its own particular day. A
week of faithful work cleared the ath
latic track of weeds, harrowed it, and
covered if, to the distance of 120 yards
with sandstone dust. If this experi
ment proves successful, after the ground
has been rolled, leveled, and wet down,
it is probable that the entire track will
be similarly covered. A man will be
hired to help complete the work and
before many days the track will be in a
fair condition to train on. Places inside
of'theovul have been prepared for the
tunning jumps and the pole vault.
