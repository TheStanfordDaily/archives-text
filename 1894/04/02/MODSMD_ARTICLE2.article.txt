Over two hundred Stanford students
availed themselves of the free privileges
of the lee Skating llink Saturday night
following Friday, Stanford Diy at the
Fair and from different parts of the
l.irge San Francisco pavilion they con
tinually manifested the fact that they
could outyell the smaller Berkeley con
tingent The sympathies of the two
thousand people present seemed to be
in the most part with Stanford.
At nine o'clock the ice was cleared
of the regular skaters and the two
university teams made their appearance
amid great applause. The Stanford
team, attiied in red sweaters, was coin
posed of Dart., '97, goal keeper; II.
Reynolds, '96, half hack; Davey, '96,
Vanderveer, 96, and De Wolf, '97,
rushers This team had beeu selecte 1
by the manager of the rink as the five
best Stunfotd skaters available among
those who appeared in the preliminary
contest. In the forenoon they defeated
a team from the Olympic Club. The
fir«t half of thirty minutes resulted in
two goals for the U. representatives,
of whom Noble, '97, was the best
skater on the ice. The second half re
sulted in no goals on either side, the
Berkeley boys playing as before on a
strict defensive and guarding their
i;oal with several men every time it was
approached.
On all sides it was conceded that the
Stanford men proved themselves the
better skaters gaining fully three tries
at goal to their opponents' one, but they
displayed poor judgement in leaving
their own goal so poorly guarded and in
driving hard at a »oal which could only
be trained by careful playing
The contest, thouuh not an intercol
legiate affair except in name, was u
source of much enthusiasm aud interest
to the spectators.
