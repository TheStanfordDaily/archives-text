time
The pin is a small jjold skull from
the eyes of which two little jeweled
iyed snakes twine to the top of the
forehead while their tails dandle from
the mouth of the i-kull
The original design, which whs left
in front of Encina Hall the nijrht re
ferred to, had the (Jreek letters Sitrma
.Sigma upon the forehead of the skull
Following is the original member
