There is published today the March
statement of the Encina Boarding Club.
It is satisfactory to get it at this time as
it answers the many complaints that
have been heard about the small rebate
that has been allowed to those who left
the hall for more than seven days dur
ing vacation. From the statement it
appears that there is a very small bal
ance in spite of the strict and almost
injudicious economy exercised with re
gard to table supplies. It is a question
for the committee to settle whether it
is not wiser to keep a full hall at the
expense of a good table even though
they should be compelled to raise the
price a little.
