In spite of the interest that is taken
by the student body in the coming de
clamation contest it is impossible to get
any definite information about the prob
able contestants or when the event ,will
take place Hooks have been placed in the
'ibrary for the use qf those intending to
take part. All that seems needful is to
Fettle the date for the, contest and the
terms for competition. So long as the
state of inertia continues in the student
body that has pervaded it lately it is
likely that the contcst will be postponed
&o many times that it will, in the end,
conflict with the final examinations fur
the year,and find those interested in the
midst of other work.
