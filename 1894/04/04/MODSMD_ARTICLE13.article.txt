It is probable that a .special train
will be run to the campus from San
Francisco on April 14th, the occasion
of the intercollegiate tennis tournament
and baseball game, and that about three
hundred students from the University
of California may come down with the
excursion. It such should be the case
no more practical manifestation of a
friend 1) feeling for our fellow collegians
across the bay could be made than a
free luncheon tendered them by the
Kncina Hoarding Club, whose members
may be said to form the great nucleus
of our campus life. The cost would be
insignificant when the object is consid
ered and the facilities of the hall borne
in mind.
