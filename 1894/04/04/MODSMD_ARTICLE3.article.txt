# The
						South Wing of the Museum.
## 
### 
Probably only a small per cent, of
the students know that the first floor of
the south of the museum has been
recently opened to the public, contain
ing a display by far the most interest
ing to the average student of any yet
made accessible to us. It has increased
interest because in it are many articles
from the collection of Iceland Stanford
•I r.
Entering the first room of the south
wing from the vestibule, a row of c ibinets
on the right, containing a very complete
collection of imph merits of the stone age
meets the eye On the left, and in cases
•town the middle of the room, is what
may bo culled the Indhn collection.
Basket work, ornamen's, implements of
warf'uc and of domestic life, customes
and relies of early coast history lure
one into passing delightful hours i>.
their examination. Above the cases on
the right stands a ht»j:e polished slab of
a redwood knot on which Sreight has
painted a scene with a beautiful group
of redwoods in the foreground, behind
them stretches a sea with rolling, foam
ing breakers lighted up by the evening
sun, and in the background a glorious
sunset. The picture is worthy
of more than a passing notice.
The room west of this tii.st one con
tains a wealth of embroideries, cloths,

and costumes of Vlalasian, Corean, and
East Indian origin. Corean cabinets
and screens, inlaid with moth r of
pearl, and domestic utensils of brass
also find room here
The south room of the wing is the
pride of the museum, however. It is
ii 1 led with Chinese and Japanese curios
As one enters, one's attention is at
tracted by a magnificent bedstead of
rich woods delicately carved and inlaid
with ivory. Just before our centennial
exposition, this bedstead was made with
infinite care in Canton to be presented
to the emperor, according to the Chinese
custom, on the occasion of nis marriage,
which was approaching Hut when the
time came for its presentation bis
counsellors found an evil omen in the
carving. At each end, surmounting
the bead board and foot-board, are two
dragons, insignia of royalty, struggling
fora pearl, the jewel o f ' royalty. This,
said the emperor's wise men, on an
article of furniture used in the imperial
household would portend discord and
struggles for the throne.
So the emperor accepted the gift, as
any humbler politician would have done,
and pn.mply sent it away to that dimm
est of things to the Chinese mind, the
Centennial Exposition. In America
I he two dragons have struggled inces
santly, but tin; Emperor died in peace
ful possession of his throne.
The bedstead with its canopy is a
monument to Chinese patience ami in
difference to the flight of time. It ia
probably one of the most delicately ;• tid
intricately caived pieces of w rk ever
dune even in China. The dragons and
lions, being significant of royal power,
could only be carved on a bedstead for
royalty. Ol course these figures could
be pliieed on many things used by com
mon people, just as a shoe polish 'com
pany may u>e a crown ft.r the trade
mark. Hut on bedsteads, sun shades
carried by attendants, canopies, sedan
chairs. and the like—things which cover
or contain the person—the lion and the
dragon are insignia of the royalty of the
occupant, or of his possession of the
royal favoi. The same is true of the
myihica 1 bird (ton) seen along the sides
and ends of the bedstead, resembling a
peacock somewhat. It, is a Chinese
myth that this bird never lights except
up' ti some precious stone.
Under the proj cring edge of the
elaborately carved canopy there are two
historical pieces on either side Two
r 'present atniies g'ing to battle; in one
of them a horsetuiu carries a tiag whose
inscription indicates power delegated to
him by the eiuperor On the other
side, the piece, composed,* of a sedan
chair ami its occupants and carriers,
preceded by men beating banners, and
followed by a procession, represents a
triumphal procession permitted fur three
days to the learned man, who has won
t he highest honors in the t x • initiations
for the fourth, or highest, degree.
Tho eight figures in the corners of
the bedstead are probably representa
tions of the eight, great genii, who enter
so often into Chinese traditions. For
instance, the sea gods once made war
on the ei_iht great genii. The genii let
the water out. ol the ocean and made
fire and smoke take its place, to the
destruction of the sea gods. Some of
these genii, with the emblem of their
power—the hull of a peculiar gourd or
melon—are seen on the two splendid
screens in the west corners of this room.
One of these, with smoke issuing from
the gourd and enveloping a dragon, re
«alls pleasant memories of the Arabian
Nights
I he sunshade standing at. the west
side of the room shows, by its material,

the figures and the richness of the em
broidery, and the number of plaits in its
covering, the high rank of the one en
titled to have it carried over him.
The gorgeous piece of yellow silk in
the case on the west was made to be sus
pended between the front supports of
the canopy of a bedstead. Chinese
verses are written on it. This illus
trates their custom of writing maxim* or
verses everywhere —on tapestries,
screens, pictures, teacups, e'c.
In eases on the south are some inter
esting mythical figures in embroidery.
One piece represents an old man hold
ing a peach in his hand. The tradition
is that there is a kind of peach which
it takes nine thousand years to mature.
It gives perpetual life to those who
possess it. The old men represented
have stolen three successive crops ol
this mystical fruit, so their age is
greater than twenty-seven thousand
years.
Other embroidered pieces represent
sea-gods riding fishes, silk-worms in the
buttei fly state of existence, etc. A
piece in the middle case represents
Confucius lying by a deer. Confucius
was a deer in his former state of exist,
ence, and during his human life his
former self came to liitn in an appari
tion; soon after this lie died.
The cases of Japanese armor and
weapons, bronzes and lacquer work are
of great interest and value. Chairs,
cabinets, screens, etc., of oriental work
manship, are placet! ahout in great pro
fusion. The air is rich with the odor
of sandalwood. 11 is doubtful if such
an exhibit as this of the Chinese and
Japanese room is to be seen anywhere
else in this country. One leaves it
with regret and with the 112 eling that it
is worthy of the princely building in
which it. is housed
