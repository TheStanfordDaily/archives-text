Commencement week lias heretofore
been'rtfther a dull oct'aiion, but the
time is coining when the* individuals of
the graduating classes will be better
known by reason of their, logger con
nection, with this University. -With
the Class of' 94 the last of the smaller
graftings from other colleges will have
be< h graduated and there \yill follow
the.ad.vont of large graduating classes
whose college years in tile main. have
been spent here.
When that time shall arrjve com
mencement week, by reason .of. the.large
number whose personal interests will
keep them on the caucus, must surely
become a time given over to social en
joyment long restrained by the necessity
for study and by the bugbear of exam
inations. The very respectable number
of this year's graduates, their three
years' re?>idence here, the graduating
exercises,'the senior farce, and the
senior danl'C —all should fofnr induce
ments sufficient to'cause a large num
ber to remain during the week follow
ing the examinations. If a sufficient
number remain this year other social
functions, such as fraternity receptions,
for instance, might go towards making
commencement week a truly social
time.
