The Glee Club was allowed twelve
dollars by the Associated tudents for
their services on Stanford day at the
Midwinter Fair, as a compromise after
their original demands for twenty dol
lars. In connection with this charge
it should be stated that the (Jlec Club
refused to contribute their services
toward the program at Festival Hall
unless they should receive the amount
mentioned The urgent necessities of
the occasion demanded that they be
paid, but their unworthy conduct re

cluh lias been gained not so much
through individual abilility, though that
exists to a praiseworthy degree, as
through the fact that the name of the
University has, as it naturally would,
attracted attention to the organization
bearing it.
It is not likely that, the same mem
bership traveling under any other than
the University name could attain the
same financial success that the results
of the Easter trip show The principle
of the charge and not its amount is
what should meet with disapproval.
The Glee Club, unlike the Mandolin
Club and the Varsity nine, were already
in the city, having delivered a most
successful public concert on the prev
ious evening, and had no instruments 01
paraphernalia to carry about; and they
were put to little inconvenience, for they
mng in ordinary street clothes.
If on another such occasion the
student body wishes an inexpensive
favor from one of its organizations, the
very existence of which its tolerance
and encouragement make possible, it
should be forthcoming without financial
remuneration.
