## 
### 
The Class of '95 at the request of ten
members held a rather hurriedly an
nounced meeting in the chapel at 1 :20
p.m. Stafford, made president of the
class through llollister's departure from
college, presided at the meeting, which
was attended by about sixty persons.
Copeland as one of the petitioners
stated that an explanation was desired
concerning the price of admission to the
farce and the work of the hop com
mittee
Kesßinger as chairman of the latter
committee read a report embracing in
the main what was printed in yesterday's
issue concerning the junior bop The
forenoon will be devoted to some sort of
athletic exercises; the afternoon, to the
farce; and the evening to the dance.
Kaeh tickct to the dance will admit one
gentleman and as many ladies having
invitations as he cares to escort. Ladies
unaccompanied by escort, must pay the
regular admission of three dollars
charged for gentlemen. In regard to
the price of admission to the farce Kes-
Ringer reported that certain expenses
for scenery, costumes, programs, tickets,
etc. were necessary, and furthermore

that the hop committee desired some
fund to fall back oil in case the ex
penses of the evening's entertainment
should exceed their estimates
Certain members of the class have
manifested a disinclination to attend the
reception because in order to secure an
invitation for the satisfaction of their
personal pleasure they must square their
just debts with the class treasurer and
help to make the first junior annual a
success and a credit to the class that
issues it. Hoover reported that, only
seventy five members of the class had
paid their assessment of two dollars for
the annual.
It was announced that the cost of re
freshments would be $233 and that
music w< uld be $80. which statement
Kessinger corroborated; and lie added
tliat electric lights, which will run as
long as desired, will be $12, and other
little incidental expenses would be
necessary. The sale of one hundred and
forty tickets will make the evening's
expenses, so the committee man re
ported, come out just even.
Alter considerable animated discus
siona motion was passed thatallthose who
shall have paid their annual assessment
shall be issued free tickets to the farce
and that all other persons be charged
fifty cents. Another motion was car
ried to the eflvct that no member of
the class who has not paid his assess
ment be admitted to the hop.
A motion in the form of a resolution
wis carried that the class be responsi
ble for all reasonable indebtedness in
curred by the committee tin junior day.
