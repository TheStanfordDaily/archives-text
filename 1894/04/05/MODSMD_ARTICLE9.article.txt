# Student Co-Operative Laundry.
## 
### 
A meeting of the boarders at Kncina
Flail was held Tuesday and Pro
lessor Marx addressed the students
upon the advisability of taking, with
next year's lease of the hall, the lease
of the laundry located at, the stock
farm on the campus. This laundry
was built and equiped by Senator Stan
ford three yearss' ago at a cost of $3,500,
and was leased to some Chinese who
were given the contract to do the laun
dry work for Kncina and Koble halls,
such work as was then done by the
institution when the bedding, towels,
and table linen were furnished to the
boarders. After an experience of
about three months the Chinese, find
ing that they could not make it pay
without other lauudry work, gave up
the laundry lease.
A number of men have since looked
at the plant but have failed to take up
the business. At the beginning of the
college year several students investi
gated the matter with the idea of leas
ing the laundry ar.d running it them
selves, but they abandoned the project
when they learned that from $300 to
$400 was required to make necessary
repairs in the premises, and that the
cost of running the laundry including
the wages of from five to eight men
would be something like $050 to $700
per month. Hut all these failures to
take up the business were made in view
of the fact that strong competition
would be met with from the laundries
in neighboring towns that were already
in the field and holding student patron
age.
Hun on a co operative plan the laun
dry might easily secure all, or nearly
all, the work of both halls, besides a
great deal of work from other student
residents on the campus and in Palo
Alto. It is estimated that $550 per
month is now spent in Kncina Hall
alone for laundry. This amount in it
self would almost pay the running ex
penses The rental of the plant is
sixty-five dollars per month.
A committee, consisting of 11. C.
Hoover, 95, chairman, Stowell, gr.,
and P. R. Frost, '97, was appointed to
investigate the mattor for the boarding
club.
