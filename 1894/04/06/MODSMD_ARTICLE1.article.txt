# Tomorrow's Baseball Game.
## 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 2 o'clock the
University of California baseball team
will play the Uuiversity of the Pacific
on the diamond here, for the purpose
of familiarizing the U C. nine with the
grounds upon which they are to play
the first game of the intercollegiate
series with us next Saturday (the 14th
iust ) Twenty-five cents admission will
be charged those who have not season
tickets; but ladies will be admitted free.
The grounds are now in good condition,
a new backstop has been put up, and
tin* field has been rolled and watered.
The make up of the teams is not known,
but the"U K nine will probably not
differ much from the one which was de
feated here by the freshman class a few
weeks ago.
