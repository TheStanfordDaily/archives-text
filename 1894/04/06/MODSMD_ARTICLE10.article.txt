# The
						Farce.
## 
### 
The farce will he presented in En
cina gymnasium at two o'clock Friday
afternoon instead of in the chapel as at
first supposed. In consideration of this
change additioral work in the prepara
tion of the improvised theatre will be
necessary, and it is hoped that members
of the class will lighten the arduous
task of the committee when they are
called upon for assistance.
Reserved seats will be fifty cents,
but general admission to the new place
of production will be twenty-five cents.
