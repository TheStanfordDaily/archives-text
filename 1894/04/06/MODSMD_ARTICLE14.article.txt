It cau safely be said that no single
institution in California is doing more
to attract a good class of immigrants
into the state than this University
According to the new register four hun
dred students, many of them with their
families, have come to the coast this
year for the express purpose of taking
work here, and a very large proportion
of them intend to remain in the state
alter graduation.
In this connection it may n'ot be
amiss to contrast California's attitude
towards her educational institutions
with that of other states. Most states
do not tax their scln ols and colleges a
dollar; California taxes them as heavily
as her distilleries or other private enter
prises, and in addition levies a five per
cent, tax on all legacies left them.
It will not be so always, of course
The people of the Pacific Coast some
day will be able to see a distinction be
tween institutions run for private gain
and those which devote their entire re
sources to public elevation and educa
tion. In the meantime peiseverance
in presenting facts and patience in mak
ing comparisons by students and f>iad
uates cannot help but hasten that day.
