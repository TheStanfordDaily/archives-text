Further iu regard to what has been
teimcd by some members of the Glee
Club a malicious and uncalled-for at
tack upon their organization without
foundation or cause, we would say that
the necessary expeuses of one day's stay
in the city are not, so very far in ex
cess of railroad and bus fares Irom San
Francisco to Palo Alto and return.
The Glee Club, it is said, intended to
spend Stanford Day following their con
cert iu the city here on the caiupus
because by so doing they could save
money. The assertion is also made that
the amount charged for services on
Stanford Day was to cover the necessary
difference iu expense caused by a day
in the city.
The per day rate for individuals,
perhaps less fora company of fifteen,
at the hotel where the club stayed
while in the city is one dollar and a
half. The railroad fares and bus fares
down here and back would be how
much? Everyone knows.
It is a well-known fact that the Glee
Club has been to considerable expense,
and that it has practiced long and
faithfully. It is also a well-known fact
that membership in the Varsity Glee
Club is looked upon, by the public at
least, as a matter of no little honor
Bearing this in mind and the more ma
terial consideration that the treasury
now contains something like three hun
dred and fifty dollars, which is for the
individuals and not for any University
fund, the club cannot be said to be
fi persecuted organization struggling
:igainst an unappreciative public.
The issue or retention of a few com
plimentary tickcts (and the issue of
complimentary tickets is a courtesy ex
tended to the press everywhere) cannot
affect the character of our criticisms,
if wo wish to make any, of those giving
ontertainments upon the campus.
