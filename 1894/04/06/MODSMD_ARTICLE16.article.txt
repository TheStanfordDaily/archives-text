# Work for Tramps.

### 
Many persons have been annoyed by
applications for work or aid made by un
known persons. As it is not right
either to refuse or give without inquiry,
and as any thorough investigation is out
of the question for the ordinary resident,
a need was felt for some agency to deal
with this class of persons. Under the
direction of the department of economics i
and social science a small lodging house
and wood-yard have heen opened at the:
camp under the management of Mr. ;
T. K. Warren, '94. The case of any
homeless applicant will be fully inquired
into, and suitable relief, together with
an opportunity to saw oak wood, will be
offered. All are invited and urged to
refer unknown applicants to Warren,
'(>4, whose office hours will be at the
camp from 6 to 7 each day.
