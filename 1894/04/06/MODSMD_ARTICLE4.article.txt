# Prof. Goebel's Lecture Wednesday Evening on "America in German Poetry."
## 
### 
In the development of the mental
life of Germany numerous traces of in
fluences proceeding from the new world
disclose themselves. And as the splen
dor of the Orient was reflected in Ger
man literature, in like manner the newlv
discovered wonderland in the far-off
west was to reappear in German poetry.
The new world, since the Kith century,
has been the goal of the roaming and
TtdVciiiiii ous Geitnaniu npiril, and unlet*
with the magic power ot new advancing
ideas into the thoughts and poetic liter
attire of the (icrman people.
But not earlier than the previous
century can we search fora lasting in
fluence of America upon the poetic
mind of Germany. We class it as one
of the most beautiful dispensations in
■he history of the world that the great
American revolutionary struggle and
the founding of our republic coincided
with that mighty lifting up of the Ger
man spirit which ushered in the classical
German era. In its sense of liberty
America has exerted no small influence
on German poetry and thereby on the
dovf lopment of spiritual life and culture.
The first one to greet this "dawn of

freedom" with poetic rapture waß none
other than Klopstock. Hy his odes he
exerted a deep felt influence upon
the thought of the German people.
Claiming truth to be the highest merit
of poetry he introduced the uew poet
ideal as the moral leader of mankind.
This "dawn of freedom" kindled glitter
ing hopes in the minds of the poets of
the sturtn and stress period, the age of
intellectual conversion in Germany.
We meet in Lenau one of »h<»sf un
happy characters of the great poetic era
beginning with the storm and stress per
iod, who fell a victim to his high en
dowments and proved what terribl"
abysses threaten the genius. In his
letters he speaks of emigrating to Amer
ica to send his imagination to school—
artistic development being his highest
aim. Hut his letters ultimately showed
him to be possessed of a demon which
was gradually setting him insane.
Having journeyed to America and not
finding it to fulfill his ideas of freedom,
■'America,"he said, "is the real land ot
decline, the Occident of humanity."
He returned to Germany before long,
but the old idea of freedom u .ver de
serted him.
We have several testimonies indica
tive of Goethe's attitude in the Ameri
can question: Above all the often
quoted lines, "America, thou hast it
better than our continent, the old.
Thou hast no crumbling castles and no
basalt. Thou art not hampered in
time of action by a useless past, or by
fruitless struggles. 1 wish thee joy anil
bl'SMug in the use of thy present."
What the poets of the storm and
stress period, incited by the American
war ot independence, had lovingly
dreamt about America, the land of a
new ideal for humanity, what Lenau
had in vain sought here, that returned
now in the mental life of the greatest
German poet at the close of his life in
the form of a legacy to his nation; free
people on free sod manifesting their
highest human power in the restless
work of culture. Could the influence
ot America on the spiritual life of Ger
many have been more powerful auu
lasting?
