We hope that the Encina Hoarding
Club will see fit to act upon the sug
gestion made a few days t-ince. Tlie
expense cannot exceed sixty dollars
even if the highest estimate of the
number of U. C. visitors proves true,
and it is not likely to. Such un
amount shared among the boarders dur

mean about twenty-five cents less re
bate at the end of the term to the indi
vidual boarder.
