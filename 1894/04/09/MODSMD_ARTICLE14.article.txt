Knoina gymnasium is the place for
the junior farce. If its production
there entails a liitle more work in the
arrangement and removal of stage
paraphernalia than would be caused in
the chapel it is also true that more
spectators can be accommodated and
greater facilities for stage effects can be
secured. The chapel with its limited
capacity and its setting of sacred pic
tures is not the best placc fora farce
nudience. An earlier year's farce, when
the student body was considerably less
than its present size, proved that two
exhibitions were necessary to accommo
date the crowd, and this farce will be
produced but once.
