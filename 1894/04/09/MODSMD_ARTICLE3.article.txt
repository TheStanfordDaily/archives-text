# U.C. Defeats the U.P. at Baseball.
## 
### 
The old U. C. baseball corpse has
| been resurrected. The rejuvenated
team presented itself on the cumnus
Saturday to play the nine from the Uni
versity of the Pacific. The object of
the game was to make the U. C. play
ers familiar with the diamond on which
i they are to play the Varsity tho com
; ing Saturday. A crowd of considerable
size gathered, attracted by curiosity as
| to the strength of the Berkeley team.
When the U. C men took the field
they seemed to outclass their boyish
! looking opponents, but the play in ir was
j even for the first five innings Jones,
the first batsman, made a single and
| scored a run for 11. C In their half of
the first inning U, C. made two tallies
jon wild throwing of their opponents.
The side was retired by a sensational
j catch by Schneider (at first) of Goslin
'• sky's foul play
Of all the Berkeley contingent of
players two men only showed evidences
of being ball players. These two were
j Simpson on third and Goslinsky on
j first. The pitchers, Murphy and Mor
den, were both wild. Murphy had a
j slow and ineffective delivery, and Mor
den was a southpaw without control
I The outfielders were given nothing
to do.
After all has been said Beikeley s'ill
has a few men who can play ball and
who wi I spare no effort to produce a
i winning team.
