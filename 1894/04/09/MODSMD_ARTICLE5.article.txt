# Yesterday's Sermon.
## 
### 
The sermon, a synopsis of which is
given below, was preached in the
chapcl yesterday morning by Rev. Ed
gar Leavitt of Santa Cruz from the fol
lowing text:
I therefore, a prisoner of the Lord, be
seach ye that ye walk worthily the voca
tion wherewith ye are called. —St. Paul,
iv, 1.
Paul spoke these words not long be
fore he was beheaded, when he was old
and feeble, and a prisoner. lie showed
by his actions and his words that he
was not discouraged, that he did not
regard his life as a failure. The words
were written for all Christians and by
"walking worthily'' he means the en
deavor to keep within the bouuds of
peace by meekness, long suffering, and
pure worship.
As the greater always includes the
less so the Christian life includes all
the life, and if we shall live the Chris
tian life worthily we shall live all life
worthily. There are no finer, no deeper
minds today than there wer« three
thousand years ago. This may be seen
by the fact that we take the ancient
orators of Gieece and the poets of the
Old World and hold them up as models
for the modern student. What do we
do today but strive to put before man
kind those higher ideals which so many
centuries ago were held up before the
eyes of the world? The writings of St.
Paul are as worthy of study today as
are the writings of the greatest modern
masters of thought.
The school, the teacher, the years we
spend in getting an education are suc
cessful if they inspire in our souls an
enthusiasm for humanity; they aie a
failure if they do not do this, whatever
else they do accomplish, I wish that
in this yreat institution there could be
established a thorough biblical and
theological department, wh're young
men could be educated for the ministry
as well as they can at schools established
for that purpose.
This is an age of breadth and expan
sion, and it is well fora man to have a
definite end in view. Whatsoever be
the goal toward which you are aiming
I beseech you, in the words of the
Apostle Paul, "that ye walk worthy of
the vocation wherewith ye are called."
