It is a pleasure to receive from the
Examiner a renewed offer of a prize
for an oratorio il coatest. Not only has
it renewed its offer but has doubled the
value of the prize, making it two hun
dred dollars. This is encouraging to
many who have already made prepar
ations for the eveut and who were be
ginning to fear that the thing would
fall through on aecount of the refusal of
Berkeley to accept our chellange. The
complete letter appears in today's issue,
and evinces a spirit that few have been
willing to admit belongs to any San
Francisco paper.
