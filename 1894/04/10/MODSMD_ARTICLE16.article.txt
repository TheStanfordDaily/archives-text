The amount of work that has been
required from the members of the junior
hop committee, combined with the an
tagonism ot those who do uot intend to
goand which they have had to overcome,
has made their task no easy one. They
Â«re to be congratulated on the outcome
of their work so far as it is apparent.
The inconvenience that has been oc
casioned by the abort notice of the date
of the t;veni was entirely beyond the
control of the committee and they were
compelled to accept the date which
the University authorities set apart
for the event. Everything bids fair
for the reception to be a most com
plete success, and to the hard and con
scientious work of the individual mem
bers of the committee it must be
ascribed.
