Dear Sir: In reply to your very kind
letter of April 5. beg to say that, the
Examiner will uive a prize—preferably
a medal— of the cost, and value of $200
for an oratorical contest. It will also
give fora necoiid prize a silver medal,
the value of which will be small We
were ve*y pleased, indeed, to receive
your suggestion, and as Berkeley de
clines to enter, the honor of winning
must necessarily fall to Stanford, where
I believe it would have gone in any
event.
Should be very glad indeed to have
an oratorical contest held in San Fran
cisco, devoting the proceeds to charity,
any sueli charily as the University may
suggest. We shall cooperate with you
most, heartily in any arrangements you
may wish to carry out. We have in
creased the value of the medal from one
hundred to two hundred dollars, desir
ing to have something very handsome.
Shrove & Co having aesured mh that
they do not think they could do jusice
to the occasion fora smaller sum
If you will pardon the suggestion, we
think that the medal should be offered
f>r an intercollegiate contest, to be won
three times before it becomes actual
property, and in the event of its so
doing will provide another emblem.
The fact that Berkeley doesn't compete
now will not prevent it from competing
next year A proper explanation can
he made at the time of the contest, and
piior thereto, for the reason of the non
appearance of a representative from
Berkeley However, these things are
submitted entirely to you
Should be very glad indeed to get an
expression from you as to -what form of
srophy wou'd be preferable. Our idea

of a medal that could be worn occasion
ally at the college functions by the
actual winner, rather than a piece of
plate displayed as the trophy of the
college, is simply gathered from a cus
torn, I believe, prevailing elsewhere.
However, the Examiner will give any
trophy that is acceptable, of the value
stated
We have a suggestion to offer in this
connection: that instead of devoting the
proceeds to charity, which would ordin
arily mean some institution of en ele.
mosynary character, that the money,
whatever it is, that may accrue be set
aside to form a nucleus of a fund for the
maintenance or assistance of a student
at Palo Alto for one year, or any period
that it might be available for. It, seems
to me that there must he among the
many students at Palo Alto some young
man or woman who is not in a position
to continue over a post-graduate course
without, assistance. If the amount was
only SIOO it would perhaps lighten the
burden of some one who could be
selected either by vote of the classes or
by the passage of an examination.
Certainly there does not appear to be
any good reason why the money gained
through an oratorical contest should not
be devoted to an .educational rather than
an eleuiosynary purpose.
.Mr. Hearst's ahsonce leaves the mat
ter in my hands, but I believe that I
am representing his wishes in sugges
tions offered . The strongest wish, how
ever, is that the matter shall he ar
ranged entirely to the satisfaction of
your University Yours very truly,
