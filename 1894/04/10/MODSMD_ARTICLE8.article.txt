# The
						Town of Palo Alto Incorporated.
## 
### 
Monday was a day of unusual ex
citement in our University town, and it
was late in the night before things
quieted down to their usual every day
condition. Out of a total registration
of 130 names, 125 votes were polled.
The plan of incorporation was ac
cepted hy a vote of 98 to 21, and the
following were elected: Trustees —
J. B. Hutchinson, E. E. Smith, B.
Parkinson, Jas. Warren, and T.
Cramer; Marshal—Farndale; Clerk—
Simkins; Treasurer —G. Parkinson
In the evening the successful can
didates were serenaded and the town
illuminated with bonfires. The Univer
sity band furnished the music. As
Palo Alto is a temperance town, the
serenaders received novel treats. Cake
and ice cream soda and cigars were
liberally dealt out but Prof. E. E. Smith
outdid his rivals by offering the crowd
free access to the nine hydrants in his
front yard.
