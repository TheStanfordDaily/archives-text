San Francisco has usually been a
badly governed city for the same reason
that most of our cities are badiy gov
erned: Because most of the best citi
zens do not care to engage in municipal
politics Twice in the early history ol
the city have its citizens found it nee
essary to ignore all legal forms of con
trol, and, banded together fora common
purpose, taken the reins of reform in
their own hands. I refer to the viyil
ance committees of '51 and '50. San
Francisco has been both praised and
blamed for these committees. Also
in the later history of San Francisco the
power of popular tribunal did not pre
vail to overthrow the civil authority, but
to strengthen it, and served to show
that the ruling pow*,r lay in the hands
of our peace-loving citizens This was
in connection with the anti Chinese
riots of 1H77-78.
The occasion of these events was due
partly to the hard times which in '70
and '77 bore heavily upon California,
and which were aggravated by the im
migration of thousands of cheap Chinese
laborers, [n addition to this the winter

of '76'77 was a bad one and a large
number of men who had been accus
tomed to workinp during harvest time
were left almost destitute in the ci'v.
Alter the completion of the railroad a
larger tide of white labor set in and
Chinese labor competion was felt more
keenly than ever. The census of 1880
â€¢rave the number of Mongolians in the
state as almost 75,000, and when it is
considered that the great majority of
these were able bodied men unaccom
panied by families it might be seen
what effect they would have upon the
white people when the body of working
men in the state was not over 309,000.
Wages fell in the course of a few years,
from twenty five to nine dollars per
week. The white labcr began to find
it impossible to compete with the
Chinese and as the latter continued to
increase the former continued to stiff-r.
Congress paid little attention to the
complaints Irom far off California, and
restricted legislation was delayed by
the ruthless violence of the laboring
classes. The idle, the vicious, the
hoodlum, and the criminal took advant
age of the popular excitement and har
rassed and seriously abused the China
men of San Francisco. The police and
fire departments kept order and pre
vented disastrous conflagrations as best
they could, but were often unable to
cope with the mobs that gathered. The
citiz'ns were aroused, mass meetings
were called, and a committee of safety
was formed. From seven to ten thous
and citizens joined this committee,
which was divided into companies.
Warnings were posted throughout the
city cautioning people to keep indoors
at niuht.
Dennis Kearney and Knight were at
the he'd of tho workiegmen. The
former had a remarkable control over
the men and made ioflimtnatory
speeches and wrote flaming letters to
the Chronicle, Both were arrested
form iking incendiary speeches, hut
were dismissed Several fires and riots
occurred, but. law and order finally pre
vailed
Is not San Francisco today again for
getting the lesson of the past? Nor is
San Francisco alone nor chief among
the Atnericon cities in meriting this
caution.
