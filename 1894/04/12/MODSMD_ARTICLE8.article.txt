# Juuior Reception.

### 
The saie of tickets for the Junior
Reception has fallen considerably below
the expectations of its managers. At I
the time of going to press hardly more!
than half of the number necessary to
insure the success of the affair had sig
nified their intention of attending. This!
is unfortunate for the Ifniversify as well
as for the junior class, for among a body
of over nine hundred students it in- j
deed must be a peculiar combination of
circumstances that can prevent the suc
cessful occurrence of at least one an
nual reception. Some have doubtless dei
ferred the purchase of tickets until the:
eleventh hour, and it is earnestly re-[
quested of all such that they purchase
at once, that the eommi'tee may be able
to get an approximate idea of the num- !
her they will be called upon to enter
tain.
