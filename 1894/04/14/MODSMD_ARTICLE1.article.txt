# The
						Junior Reception.

### 
The Junior Reception Friday night
was an appropriate ending to an un
usually pleasant day and one whose
various interesting features refleoted no
little credit upon the class that inaugur
ated the observance of Junior Day.
Weeks rgo the idea of a junior dance
was conceived and a committee was
appointed to make arrangements, '' lie
unannounced perplexities and the delays
known to the committee alone, which
were caused by a curious objection to a
dance on the campus during the period
of study, were finally, but when only a
very short time for preparation re
mained, ended by a concession that a so
called class reception could be given.
In what respect except in name there
ception of last year differed from a dance
and a dance only no one seems to know.
That this yen's junior reception was
little else than a dance is evinced in no
better way perhaps than in the fact that
there were twenty-four dances on tin;
program and that seven additional
numbers were introduced.
Ir. was the swell large social event in
the history of that class which dates
its birth from the opening day of' the
University, and it.was without cxceo
tion the most enj iy able and brilliant af
fair that has ever occurred on the
campus
Eneina gymnasium, the theatre of
the afternoon, where ifie thrones of day
visitors had collected with the student
residents to witness the junior farce,
was converted into a ball room Ever
greens and hunting hid the usually bare
walls nf the barn-like hall, and the fl «>r
glistened bene'ith a polish of wax
Dozens of incandescent electric lights
produced an almost day light, effect At
one end 112 the room and high above the
embowered platform where the orches
tra was stationed vv;is a larje '95 formed
by small electric light "lobes. A pretty
nook in oim corner of ihe room was *rc
served for the p itrone-ses oft lie recep
tion; Mrs. James Braly, Mrs. Unfits L.
Green, Mrs Ernest M Pease, Mrs Joim
M Stillui in, and Miss Kllen F. Tlioiup
son.
The quiet of the perfect moonlight
night was early broken by the rumble
of wbee's of carriages as they brought
the guests to the gymnasium and
hurried off after others, for such an af
fair given fir from a city necessarily taxes
the available conveyances loihe utmost.
13/ nine o'clock all the guests had ar
rived and dancing began. Three pre
liminary numbers were gone through
with before the regU'ar program was
Started with the promenade winch was
led by the class president, W. A. Staf
ford, and Miss Marion F D »le. liitlie
winding, graceful figures of I lie much
the large assemblage showed off to the
best advantage The charming faces
and figures of the young holies, their
dainty gowns, the beautiful flowers they
carrit d, their part nets in immaculate
evening attire—all lorim-d a picture
of you'll and gayety at. its best, the
season of happy college days
It were easier to say who were the
belles of the ball than who was the
belle, for besides some of the young
lady students there were several ex
ceedingly pretty visitors from abroad.
At midnight supper was served in
the balconies, where long tables were
arranged, but they could not seat, more
than half the guests; so dancing wa>
continued until there should be r omii
for the others. The catering was done
by Swain of San Franciso.
After supper the dancing was re
sumed, and did not cease until three
o'clock. Perfect oance music by llu->
b< r's Hungarian Orchestra from the

leading popular airs made that v«-ry
important accessory to a successful ball
all that the most fastidious could wish.
Encores were repeatedly called for and
generously given.
The programs were unique affairs.
I On the outside folder was a monogram
of "L S .1 U" with "Junior Reception"
and " '95 " prominently combined. The
inner leaves contained the order of*
dances and the music, and the names of
the patronesses, of the reception com
mittee, and of the floor committee.
To the reception committee in the
main is due the credit of the successful
carrying out of the various arrange,
nieiits of J utiior Day. The committee
consisted of F. E. Kessinger (chair
man), Miss Burke, Miss Steffetis, F. 11.
