# Report of Committee to Investigate a Student Laundry.
## 
### 
Gentlemen; â€”I lie committee has in
spected the laundry and received ad
vice and estimates from four experi
enced laundrymen as the result of which
we reached the following conclusions:
It would be usele-s to consider the
subject unless a dry-house and proper
water connections were put in; for it ,
would be impossible to do the amount
of business and quality of work neces
sary to pay expenses aud give satisfac-1
tiou without, this added equipment..
I he general average of estimated ex-,
penses from four sources was 861)0 to'
$000 per month business. There is at
present about $750 per month of steam
laundry business on the campus, so thai
if all this work c >nid be obtained about
fiil'teen percent to eighteen per cent re
duction could be given from present
pviee.,
If some work could be obtuined from
Palo Alto and vicinity still further re 1
ductious could be made. But it must
be carried in mind that till outside!
hoarding houses and clubs now receive ]
twenty per cent, discount, and there ;
would be a part of the work on the cam
pus that could not be obtained.
So that the committee recommends j
that inasmuch as some improvement
could surely be made on the present sys- j
tem, that the conrniltee in charge of the
halls recieve scaled bids from leput
able laundries with a prospect of letting
the laundry in the halls to the firm otter
ing the largest discount from present
prices. And if this arrangement cannot
be effected that the hoarding club>
further investigate the project of a co
operative laundry.
