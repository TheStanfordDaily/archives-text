## 
### 
At 9:45 yesterday morning, one ul
the brightest and sunniest of the spring,
a large number sought the shade of the
'1)5 Oak to attend ihe opening exercises
of the first Junio 1 * Day. The Hilling
shadows of the leaves of the oak, as
they shook in the breeze, making i host

junior by his command of fitting words
and pleasing phrases llindsdill spoke

speeches of the other classmen. There
