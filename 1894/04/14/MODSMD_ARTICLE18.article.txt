A. R. Cotton, President of the Class of '94.
Mr. I'resicient, Members of" the Class j
of '95:â€”Wiicu your committee re-1

quest'd me to make a few remarks on
this occasion, they kindly informed me
as to what was expected. While not
devoting too much time 'o my own
class, 1 was to compliment you consid
erably, mention the other classes inci
dentally, and praise the faculty some
what for granting this holiday. Above
all, however, I was to do this very
: quickly, as many interesting speeches
were to follow, and the athletic sport
would be exceedingly ludicrous. As far
as you are concerned the presence of
j the Class of 94 on this occasion should
jbe a sufficient coiuplinieiit,. C.incern-
I ing ourselves, we take the greatest
pleasure in being so royally entertained
by the Pioneer Class at, this, our first
and last attendance at Junior Day exer
cises. It is exceedingly pleasant to
| meet a class upon such an occasion as
this with whom we have been inti
mately acquainted so long, for it is now
nearly three years since we entered the
University as sophomores and fresh
men. We did not quarrel in those
days as our successors have done since.
On the other hand *94 treated you
with marked respect, for your friend
ship was preferred to your enmity.
You cannot say that your rights were
ever severely encroached upon, or that,
you were diawn into any serious rushes
in order to belittle you in the eyes of
the student body. Who will say that
this treatment was not most generous
and magnanimous? Purely none of you
are ungrateful enough to siy that we
J were only diplomatic. Hut, however
j you may look upon our actions, there is
no doubt that '9G would have done well
if it had followed its predecessor's
I worthy and salutary example.
I n athletics, also, we have never com
; peted, but voluntarily accorded you the
palm. We could have procured an ex-
I cellent captain and an exceedingly c*p
; ab'e manager tor a football team if their
time had not been so largely taken in
1 performing these same duties fur the
! Varsity eleven. Hut what was worse,
j we could not get more than nine or ten
star players unless we procured recruits
in some way from the basket-ball team
of lioble.
Successful as you may have been in
other ways we consider the publication
of the fiist "annual" your greatest
achievement. It, cannot be doubted
| that when in the distant future a com-
I plete set of'"The Stariford Quad" will
cover an entire shell in the University
I library, you will be remembered espec
ially as having published the first vol
ume. As the only way to perpetuate
our fame we have in >de every effort to
obtain honorable mention in its pages,
(nit sadly fear the keenest dissappoiut
inent is stored up there.
Hardly less important, however, is
j the establishment of Junior Day, for
these occasions, these holidays, espec
ially increase our love fcr our Alma
Mater, and will furnish us with fondest
I recollections in after years. In fact
this day is such a pleasant one that we
I sincerely regret our college days are
i drawing to a close.
The only consolation we have is that
i we are going to have such worthy sue
cessors: students who, one year from
j today, can no doubt uphold the dig
nity of being seniors even as well as we
Your work up to this time merits
the greatest pruise. You have ever
j striven for the welfare of the Iniver
| sity, and before you graduate from
j this institution we confidently expect
j that you will establish other woithy
j precedents foundations upon which
future classes can erect the grandest
structures.
