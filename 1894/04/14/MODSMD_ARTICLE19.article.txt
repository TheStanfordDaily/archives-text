upon by the oilier classes and the peo
ple in general. lie showed how this'
was natural, but how it was unjust, lie
some laughable experiences of his
own dining last year in connection with
ilie first rush at the tank, where, when
the '9;>'h were trying to take the tank
by means of a ladder the speaker had
"in the interests of tlio-e who owned
the ladder, and of those who were in
its way " attempted to persuade the

rection, until it assumed a very pained
and disproportionate expression I
then and there vowed dire and eternal
vengeance on these men Hut only
last week one of these same persons,
who is now a candidate for office, came
j to me, and with many protestations of
friendship, fell upon this same neck,
once so pained and distorted, and wept
copious tears," thus showing that all
ill fueling had passed a way, and he as
sured his audience that all such inter
class ill feeling would ultimately pass
away. lie jxave a brief record of
some of the victories of '9(5, some rea
sons why they felt proud, and a para
phrase of Longfellow's verse :
" The Soph, an iihtv man i•* he,
With larjie and Miow'y hxtid-:
The tarred roi e of his rushes
Is strong as iron bands,"
lie then continued:
Hut to speak seriously, Mr. l'resi
dent and fellow students, I, as the re
presentative of the Class of 90, am
proud to testify to the many good and
ennobling deeds of your class, and to
congratulate you upon the felicities
which tltis day will bring forth. You
have a record ol which any organiza
tion might be proud. I'lie lir.->t lo cu
rt r a new and niitri d field wlio.se virgin
soil gave promise of inu'di, by the fx
hibition of sterling good sense and un
faltering patriotism, y> u have, in a
measure made the record of our Univer
sity what it, is; you laid (lie foundation
for an at liletio association that has not
a dangerous rival on the Pacific coast, j
you have lielfed, as was in your power,
to swell the ranks of our football
teams, our baseball nines, our »lee
clubs; in fact whenever a victorious
team or a talented organization of any
kind has been sent out to do battle with
our enemies, or to provide entertain
ment for our fiiends, I am pleased to
say that the Pioneers have always had a
I large representation. Like our pioneer
fathers and mothers who braved the
dangers of a passage across •• ti unknown
continent, and suffered the pangs of
| domestic separations in order to found
a new empire on the Pacific, and then
remained to rear us and instruct us in
the laws and duties they themselves
had 11niaine t and established, so have
the present juniors, by their unselfish
example and unhesitating allegiance to
the best interests of our University,
schooled us younger ones in the art ol
sell-governuieiit, of sacrificing devo
tion to our benefactors, and of making
fiie most of the brilliant opportunities
Sjirea I at. our feet.
And we of' 96 in taking up this trust
which you leave to us untarnished by
base or ignoble deed, will endeavor to
merit, the same approbation in turn,
which you do now receive We shall
make it our endeavor to perpetuate the
name and fame of Stanford in every
clime. We shall always make our in
dividual and collective interests subserv
ient to those of ou r Alma Mater. We
shall never allow it. to be said that we
' have neglected our duties nor misinter
preted our opportunities; we can never
i say that we were the first class at Stan
ford, but it will be an everlasting plcas
j urea remunerative recompense for
! our tr'als and an unfailngjoy to our old
; age to say that we constituted the sec
. otid class and that we followed faithfully

in the blitzed path of those who had
f»nne before. When you are none, we
sha'l try to keep up the same old cus
toms and habits which have been nur
tured under your tutelage. The quiet
nooks of the arboretum, the shady
flower bed.«> of the quadrangle, and the
peaceful walks of the arcade shall be
made to render pleasure to those whose
soul-i would fain traverse that broad
pathway of life which we call love.
The pale faced Hiawatha will court his
lovely Minnehaha as of yore, and even
this old monarch of the forest, appropri
ated by and consecrated to those whom
we honor tndav, will serve as a trysting
place for those whose hearts are wont to
beat as one.
In closing, then, I will say that when
we sliall have this whole space covered
by imposing buildings, when their stone
walls shall encompass ten thousand stu
dents. when the Santa (Mara valley i-hall
have become the educational centre of
the civilized world, when our alumni
sliall have settled in every hamlet in
this broad land and their influence shall
have permeated into every phase of
human development and activity—then
and not till then, must we think of de
flecting for an instant our effoits for the
aL'LM'andizement. and advancement of
Stanford.
