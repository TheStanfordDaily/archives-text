# Presentation of the First Junior Farce.
## 
### 
The largest crowd that ever gathered
in the spacious Eneina gymnasium was
present ye.-terday afternoon to witness
the production of a play drawn entirely
from Stanford life Tne play, "A
Change of Heart." a society drama, in
three scenes, written by a member of
the Class of '95, Charles K. Field, Was
received by a highly appreciative audi
ence, and is a credit to its author. The
plot is well drawn, and the writer
showed excellent ability in portraying
his extremely difficult, characters, rang
ing from a typical co-e<l. to Die .some
what hilarious and careless junior. As
a whole the cast, for the different, parts
WfS well olioseu. Charles Field, a"
Peter Saintly, acted his part in an easy
and natural manner, and showed con
siderable histrionic ability at. several
stages of the play. The hypocri'ical
scene of his conveision of Archie Flee
man and 13 ih Dasher caught him at
his be*t. To Mr Field and the Misses
Davis and A1 It*t aeh should heaccoided
the most, praise for their wmk done.
Although most of the other parts were
well acted, the speakers allowed them
selves to fall into I he al way s inexcus
able fault ot not, articulating clearly or
loud enough. Miss Jones, as Q teen
Urban, ar.d Simmons, as Archie Free
man. should be excepted fiom this criii
eisiu. Miss Jom s's work in the second
scene was mediocre, but. she caiinor. be
given too much credit for her rendering
of the difficult, part laken in the Im.m
scene. Simmons has an excellent voice
and easy, graceful immiicr. his greatest
fiult being lack of heart in the pari
assigned to him. Shirley Maker and
Kennedy were more successful in the
singing puts than otherwise, linker's
acting throughout, the first scene was
of a high order
Tie production merited the hearty
reception accorded it, and it is to he
hoped that, the succeeding junior classes
may be as fortunate in securing as
original, racy, and well portrayed a
plav as Field s 4 A Change of Heart. M
The central figure of the play is
Archie Freeman, a member of ihe ill
Plili fraternity, who entered college
fresh from the severe influence of a
putitanieal home lie has become a
"hale fellow well met." but has taken
earn that, Ins lepers home and to Dii-y
Meadowes, i he love of his unsophis i
eate«l days, have not betrayed him. The
thiMi scene- are all in Freeman's room
hi the Hi Plili fraternity house.
'I he curtain rises on a scene of rev
elry; a "feed" is in progress. A crowd
of congenial fellows ar * smoking, sing
ing. talking college gossip, and drink
ing beer. I n ihe midst of their hilarity
Peter S lint ly. "an article of virtue"
appears, arrayed in his night attire*
lie dolefully exhorts his fellows to give
up their sinful ways, while tlicy eejoy
themselves at, his expense.
When the curtain rises on the second
scene, it is ihe next afternoon and
Aichie is soliloquizing in the midst ol
the maiks of their lite debauch. Boh
Dasher, his chum, enteis with a Tele
gram announcing the immediate arrival
of Mrs. Fr> email and Daisy Meadowes.

Archic is I'rcnzied; »I last they conceive
ii plan of keeping his molher and
Diisy in the dark. Hut the further
complication presents itself: Archie's
affections are at present centred in
Queen Urban, "a college girl of the
period." A dance is to he given by
the fraternity that very night and he
has the two girls on his hands.
Hut Hob plans to monopolize Queen
during the evening, leaving Archie
live to entertain D.iisy; and secures
Queen's consent to the plan through
i lie pretext that, it is a wager that he can
Archie noticably jealous.
Mrs. Freeman and Daisy arrive.
The latter has changed utmost us much
as Archie; she, 100, has kept up the de
| ception in her letters, and now attempts
i to act as sedately as in her old ''Sunday
| school days." The plot, deepens as it
transpires that Daisy and Hob Disher
had become mutually infatuated dur
ing a seaside flirtation the previous sum
j iner at Coronado, where she passed
! under her step father's name, Beueher.
Kxplanations foil >w between the two
whieh are only partially satisfactory.
Tho third scene is in the same room
during the progress of the dance in the
| parlors. Affected, eonceiied, but well
meaning, IVter Saintly betrays the fact
to Mrs. Freeman and Daisy that Archie
is no longer the embodiment of virtue.
In his mistaken zenl he calls him a
j drunkard and a gambler Queen Urban,
becoming jealous of Archie, keeps her
I eluieh on Hob, who i» dying to be with
Daisy And so the four )oung people
are mutually miserable. At last Daisy
| explains the situation to Archie; lie ex
: plains it to Hob, and soon ihe tangle is
I straightened. Archie attempts to con
less to his molher what she has already
1 learned from Saintly; she tells him
j she d d not expect him to ro
iii,tin the Colorless hoy that lie was on
leaving home; but, warns him not, to
j carry his frolics too far. 'J bus the
| diiima ends with the expression of its
i central thought—that a college man
may deviate irom the puritanical and
\er not become lost, to high and nuble
aims.
