No pleusanter duty could devolve
upon me hs a member of the Class of
97 than ilmt which I am to perform to
dity. Whatever may be the feeling of
other classes toward the Class of 95,
that of the freshman class i>s of deep
gratitude and profound respect. Our
irratifude li.is been born out of the many
kind attentions which i's members have
shown us sit.ce our entrance into the
University. This feeling h s grnwn
stronger and stronger in the months
that, have passed but until today has
had no opportunity fur public expres
sion.
When we entered the University we
were strangers in a strange land. We
felt that, we were helpless, and in nia
irined ourselves surrounded on all si<fts
hy fierce blond-thirsty sophomores. Like
every freshman class we were in need
of friends. We needed someone to
take us in charge, and in a manner
bring us up in the way we should go.
Fortunate indeed we were t." find ready
and able friends in the members of '95.
We were overjoyed to learn that we
had a friend in a class whose history
contained no record of defeat or fail
ure. whose members were prominent
in the class-room and invincible upon
the athletic fb Id, and whose energy and
enterprise had done much toward givicg
the University its high standing among
the educational institutions of the
country.
This, then, was the character of the
class under whose leadership we were
thrown. To it whs given the work of
initiating us into the mysteries of slip
nooses, bow-knots, and half-hitches.
To it also wms left, the task of instilling
into our minds the truth that, after all,
d spite appearances, the sophomores
were human beings, and under proper
treatment could be made perfectly sub
missive and harmless. The '•treat
ment" recommended whs not the mild
est. nor was it in fact the easiest of ap
plication, but. time and perseverance
which conquer all things vindicated
the method, and for several weeks our
friends of 9(5 have been busily engaged
in explaining to us "toh// it w»s a 'tie.' "
Hut our chairman has said th it for
this one day we should forget, class ri
valries and unite as students in the en
joyment of the day. So, in deference
to the lacerated feelings of a part, of Our
audience, I will refrain from continuing
these reminiscences. It would be well
if we could all of us forget class lines
at this time, but this does not forbid us
of '97 fn ni rejoicing with our friends
Continued on Sixth Pnge.
