With the pleasures of the exercises
of the ceremonies at the '95 Oak,
of the festal gathering on the bluff j
by Lagunita, and of the reception !

I fresh in their minds, there is little

holidays.
It is peculiarly what none of
the others can be —a social event;
an occasion for the mingling of the
students with each other and with
the guests attracted by the event.
As a break in the monotony of
everyday work, necessarily some
what humdrum, it more than
atones for the loss of time occa
sioned.
