In view of past experiences it |
would seem that several beneficial ,
changes might be made in student |
body affairs. It seems to us that j
it would lead to the production and j
maintainance of better college pa- i
pers so to amend the constitution j
of the Sequoia and of the Daily
Palo Alto that the term of office for
the editor and business manager
should be but one semester, the
privilege of re-election of course
not being debarred.
A reform might well be instituted
with the new board of directors of
the daily and with the board of
control of the weekly in regard to
the cut-and-dried method of their
elections. Very few members of
these bodies secure their member
ship in them except through the
political manipulations of friends!
of a prospective candidate for one
of the positions on the papers, and j
these electors are often bound by
the ties of friendship or by a pledge;
given prior to their own election to j
support some one who may be, for
all they attempt to discover, by no;
means the most able and suitable
person for the position.
In future a more careful and in- 1
quisitive auditing of athletic man
agers' accounts might be conducive
to the realization of ii sum suffi
cient to secure that great athletic
boon, a good cinder track. The
three years' success of the football'
team is pleasant to reflect upon,
but when that success is always
accompanied by an expenditure of
more money than is taken in, and
by the failure of the manager in
his university work, there is some
thing wrong with the system.
