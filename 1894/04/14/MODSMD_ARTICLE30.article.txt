# Henry Watterson's Address.
## 
### 
Thursday evening the Hon.
Henry Watterson delivered his
famous lecture on "Money and
Morals" before the students. The
chapel was barely half tilled, for the
anticipation of the pleasures of the
succeeding holiday and the large
number of other prominent men
who have recently delivered free
addresses to the students kept a
good many from attending where
admission was charged. Those who
had the pleasure of hearing the lec
ture accord it the same praise which
it luis received wherever it has been
delivered. Below is'a summary of
the lecture.
1 am going to talk to you to
night as a patriot and not as a
partisan, as a nationalist and not
as a secularist. It is my present
wish to avoid rather than invite
controversy. But there are ques
tions which should invite discussion,
and money and morals are two of
them.
The map of North America, and
behold the view! Csesar in all his
greatness never beheld the like;
Napolean in all his glory, power,
and limitless ambition never saw
anything so vast. What a wealth
is here to elevate the mind, inspire
the soul, and make us proud of our
selves and our country. Is there
anything to mar the prospect, to
obstruct our march to triumph as a
great people? Yes —Canada and
Mexico —Canada, the convenient
Mecca of gentlemen with more
money than honor; Mexico, without
manners or morals.
1 hold that money is a relative
quaqtity, and not only relative but
illusionary. But money is one of
the greatest principles of human
life. No' man can afford to disre
gard it. Hut how few are the cases
where the possession of great wealth
has enlarged the mind or uplifted
the soul!
Success in life is happiness. The
successful man, the happy man, is
he who believes his old wife is the
Itest woman on earth. Honorable
poverty is getting to be a lost art.
In this age of the world men who
can earn $2,000 a year do not care
to sacrifice their business interests
for a seat in congress worth .$">,000
a year. They prefer to make a for
tune first and then buy a seat in
the United States Senate to satisfy
any craving they have for fame. I
do not mean to argue that the poor
est are happiest, yet it is not a
paradox that the poorest people in
Europe—the Swiss —are the proud
est and happiest in the world. In
them we find the ideal system of
.leffersonian government. The pres
ident, secures a salary of less than
$1,000 a year, an amount so small
that it does not run to trickery.
