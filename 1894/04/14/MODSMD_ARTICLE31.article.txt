The whole nation, free from the
cares which hamper the rest of
mankind, is a beautiful vindication
of Goldsmith's words:
Til fares the land to hastening ills a
prey,
When wealth accumulates and men
decay.
There are two moral dangers
ahead of us —the devil of party and
the devil of money. If you want
to read a tragedy read the history
of Wall street.
