Little any of us thought, when we
were st> tiliiiin the grammer grades
th it ihe l.'Mi of April. 1h94, would (ind
us celehra>ini; .1 iinior hay at this in
stitution. At tli.it time the plan, the
oi'minizition ot this great work, was
scarcely more than assuming shape in
the minds of our benefactors And we
inai Vel as we look hack 10 the day when
we iirst eiiteied this University to see
whit a striking traii>loi tnatioii has come
about in so short, a time
Now turn hack with me to the It t
day of Vpril, 1891. J'ur yourself m
the p isition you occupied that, day,
when with supreme delight pud intense
interest we listened to the e'oqueiit
words of the distinguished speakers on
that, memorable day Title we were
pioneers, but, the reiliziiion of that fact
only prompted us to activity in organ
izing and consolidating the class. And
out of this feeling of importance ami
responsibility grew the remarkable cl «ss
spirit, die indest. u oible lo d of union
which no other cl.i s has approached.
There were dark days during the period
of loniiation, in d many stormy meet
inwere held but out of chaos came
order and orguuiz ition, and the class was
launched on its course.
As Ireshmeti we were victors in every
contest. On the athletic field none
could approach us. We were practic
ally without competitors then, and have
been defeated but a few limes since.
II »wever, I did not come to gloat,
over the victories of the (Mass of '95.
You all know what the class has ucconi
plished in ever) department of this
University, and the loyalty and honor
with which it has stood by the institu
tion and aided its development.
A< the Pioneer (Mas*our position is a
unique one indeed. The entrance of
the (Mass of '95 into this University
marks the beginning of the second great
pioneer movement in this state —the es

Members < 1 he Class of 95, we have
reached an important point in our career:
we are Hearing the close of the third
year of valuable woik. iVe have la
bored Inline and hard toreach the present
stage in our development, and the re
sponsibility we must assume ju<t be-in*
to dawn in realny upon us. Smiii we
mu't emer into competition Willi
the wm Id, and ilien we will real ise
more than at any other time the value
of our work here.
Time speeds on. and it b« li<»i>v>-s us
to make the best of it. Let. no man say
there is an idler, an unworthy, unde
serving student in the CI ss of '95.
So lar our record is clear. Our ev> r\
act bears the impress of fairness. We
merit, we receive the respect of all.
Let nothing check (lie onward march of
our favored class. May the kind feel
ings which bind us in an indivisible
union never cease, and may the man
hood and womanhood io the hearts <>t
our members he un undying distinguish
ing in.uk of the class in and out of col
lege as long as we live.
Let us unite then today and do honor
to our ela»s with all our life and vigor,
for though classes have gone before us
and classes will f.illow us, 'here can be
in ihe history of this institution but one
