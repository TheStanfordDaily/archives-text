# The 						Aquatic Sports at Lagunita.
## 
### 
One of our pretty seuiors, while re
turning from Lagunita after having
witnessed the fan on the lake, was
heard to remark that wo were to be
treated to two farces today; one in the
gymnasium, and the other at Lagunita.
She summed up the affair at the lake
very well—a farce from beginning to
end. Kight after the dedicatory exer
cises had been completed, a very
crowd hurried to the pretty little lake
in the hills back of the quadrangle, and
by climbing fences and crossing ditches
managed to secure a position from
where the scheduled events could be
seen. From the water's edge to the
top of the oak crowned hill, a solid mass
of people were congregated. The
broad expanse of the lake in front,
with the high serrated ridges of the
Santa Cruz range beyond, the quiet,
gently sloping hills, whose thick, dark
green gra«s was dotted with beds ol
yellow poppies, and groups of young
women wearing light spring dresses,
formed a striking and beautiful picture
The band kindly carried their instru
ments up the hill and discoursed some
very pleasing music during intermissions
between events.
A singularly unaccountable indiffer
ence pervaded all who were in any way
connected with the aquatic exercises.
The spectators were kept in waiting for
something which never came off. The
only real event was a boat race between
Patterson, Oondit, Lyman, and Orcuti
and Hamilton, the latter two rowing to
gether in a two (tared boat, Patterson
won, but only by fouling his closest
competitor, (!ondit.
Wilson. Scott, Stuart, Davey, Ilaz
zird, Vanderveer, Toombs, liaiseh,
Code, Conners, Murphy, and Grove
gave some exhibitions ot swimming and
diving.
The crowd was very good natured,
a chorus of voices hailing Kennedy s
usual laie arrival and joshing him about
his breakfast being the only expression
that served to m ike known their pre
sence and their impatience.
