A book hits just been published
by Scribners entitled "Mui of
liusiues*" by \V. O. Stoddard, which
relates the fol owing reminiscence of
Senator Stanford:
"Ho had grown t:i 11 and strong, and
was a capital hand in a hay field, he
hind a plough, or with an ax in the
timber; but how could this help him in
his chosen profession? Nevertheless it
was a feat of woodcutting that raised
him to the bar. When he was eighteen
years of age his father purchased a
tract of woodland, wished to cloar it,
but had not the means to do so. At
the same time he was anxious to give
his son a lift, lie told Leluud, there
fore, that be could have all he could
make from tho timber, if he wuuld
leave the land clear of trees.
Lcland took the offer, fora new market
had latterly been created for cord wood.
He had saved enough money to hire
other choppers to help him, and he
chopped fur the law and his future
career. Over two thousand cords of
wood were cut and sold to the Mohawk
and Hudson liiver Railroad, and the
net profit to the young contractor was
$2,000. It had been earned by severe
toil, in cold and heat, and it stood for
something more than dollars."
