Stanford Wins the Game, but Not by
Good Playing-
The only intercollegiate baseball game j
of the year is past, and won —wou, in
deed, but not g oriously.
The temporary grund-stuti'l was full j
to oveiflowing when game was called,!
and tound the diamond were several
hundred college men and numerous
carriages in the background. About |
two hundred students from the Uuiver- j
sity of California had come down by
train during the forenoon, aud after !
witnessing their victory in tennis, j
viewing the buildings, and partaking j
of a free luncheon in Encina Hall, tliey
collected their scattered forces at the
ball gune during winch the well-known

from its original source sounded for the
first time on the Stanford campus
Stanford wen', first to the bat Mor ;
den was hit hard from the start and six
runs came over the rubber, Berkeley
had three men on banes in this inning
but could not score. Stanford scored
twice more in the second before guimr
out, and the long-expected "walkover" j
was in progress. But Berkeley profited !
from VVeldon's wildness to the extent
of five runs ill two innings Each side
scored once in the filth. Then hits by
Davey and Walton brought in three
runs, giving Stanford a safe lea l.
Morden's wild throws gave Stanford
one run each in the seventh and eighth
innings. The Berkeley men were al
lowed to walk round the bases in the
next inning Three bases on bulls,
three stolen bases, two hits, and an er
ror rolled up lour runs Another inn
ing like this would have been fatal foi
Stanford. But. in spite of Lewis's fourth
error Berkeley retired in short order!
and the game was Stanford's.

Berkeley men played much the same
game as against the University of the
Pacific on the campus a week ago.
The main difference was that Weldon
was less effective than Whipple of the
U P , and the Stanford team
ran bases much bettor. Simpson and
Goslinskv of the IJ C. team did fairly
well in the infield but the work of Hel
ler, Dunn, and Elsfon was ragged.
Tin- out field had hut two chances
()l the Stanford players Dyer, Down
ing and Havey altue were capable of
good ball playing. Harrelson made
some good catches but struck out six 1
times—due perhaps to the left-handed '
pitcher. Sheehan let a ball go between
his legs and forced Downing to make a 1
difficult throw to third. Lewis was
unable to handle anything, and Bu
miller let a ball go by him which he

should have stopped Walton's errors
were due to his lame arm. Weldon
had no control and was hit hard, he
sides not watching bases juoiciously.
McLuine was in good trim and should
have been played when Weldou was
found to be ineffective.
Such in brief is the story of an ex
hi hition of baseball unworthy the ability
o! our men, at least. That nearly all of
them danced on the night before the
game until three o'clock may be some
excuse fur the miserable work they did
in the field How the finer details of'
the game were juried with is shown
