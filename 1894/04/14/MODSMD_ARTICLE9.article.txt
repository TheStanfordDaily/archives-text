						INTERCOLLEGIATE TENNIS TOURNAMENT.
## The
						U.C. Victorious. 
### 
The second intercollegiate tennis
tournament, held on the Enema eouris
this morning, was witnessed by an uii
u-ually large and appreciative crowd
Berkeley was victorious in the first
tennis tournament, held some weeks
ago, in which slut won hot the first
ami second place singles and the
doubles. Sanborn's defeat of Buiniller
in the first, place singles this forenoon
gave tins year's tennis championship to
the U 0.
Ellis's subsequent victory over his
U G opponent in the second place
singles demonstrates the fact that lie is
a better man than Gage, with whom he
played a very close game in the first
tournament. Hal the doubles been
seriously played there is a fair possibil
ity that Gochrau aud Buunllcr would
have been success!ul.
The number of gaily dressed ladies
weiring cardinal or blue and gold was
especially noticeable. Play began be
tween Ellis, '07, and Gaue first, but
Sunburn and Buiniller, '07, soon entered
their Court and heLceforth the specta
tors were kept, busy watching the two
contests. Sanborn, II C. '04. won
three sets straight from Buiniller, '07,
the games standing 7-0, 6-3. o—3
lie lost but fifty points to Bumilier's
ninety, and won twenty one to the lat
ter's eighteen. Ihe play was careful at
the beginning, but as the players
warmed up tliey gained confidence and
ihe name became swifter aud more
accurate. Sanborn's net play won the
contest for him. lie uses a moderately
slow chop s roke, but is very accurate
in placing the ball. Buiniller played a
defV n-ive back court game most of the
time Occasionally he rallied and
showed the brilliant stylo of game that,
be is capable of playing. The score
was us follows: Sanborn, double faults,
2; aces by serve, 0; passes, 21; out of
court. 24; net balls, 30. Buiniller,
double faults, 1; aces by serve, 0;
passes, 18; out of court, 30; net balls,
51.
Ellis. '07, won from Gage, U C. '07,
the games standing 7-5, G-I, 1-6, and
o—f. The play was very close and ex
citing throughout. Ellis took the first
two sets alter hard work, the ball cross
ing the net many times during one
point. In the third set he weakened,
but rallied u<jain in the fourth. His
game was well played and showed the
effects of his conscientious practice
since the lust tournament. Gage played
a strong, steady, but up-hill game
throughout. The following was the
score: Ellis —double faults, 4; aces by
serve, 1; passes. 24; out of court, 45;
net balls, 46. Gage—double faults, 5;
aces by serve, 0; passes, 23; out of
court, 4l>; net balls, 50. One notice
able feature of both contests was the
absence of strong service, as is shown
by the score of but a single ace.
It was announced that the contest in
doubles would be played off after the
baseball game, but on acount of the
lateness of the hour when the ball
game ended Buiniller,'o7, and Cochran,
'06, defaulted to Sanborn and Byxbee,
but played an exhibition m .teh with
them for about forty five minutes, sur
pr sing the spectators by the strength
of their play.
