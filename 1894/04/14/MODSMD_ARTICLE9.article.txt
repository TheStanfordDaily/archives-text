# THE 						INTERCOLLEGIATE TENNIS TOURNAMENT.
## The 						U.C. Victorious. 
### 
The second intercollegiate tennis
tournament, held on the Encina courts
this morning, was witnessed by an un
usually large and appreciative crowd.
Berkeley was victorious in the first
tennis tournament, held some weeks
ago, in which she won both the first
and second place singles and the
doubles. Sanborn's defeat of Bumiller
in the first place singles this forenoon
gave this year's tennis championship to
the U. C.
Ellis's subsequent victory over his
U. C. opponent in the second place
singles demonstrates the fact that he is
a better man than Gage, with whom he
played a very close game in the first
tournament. Had the doubles been
seriously played there is a fair possibil
ity that Cochran and Bumiller would
have been successful.
The number of gaily dressed ladies
wearing cardinal or blue and gold was
especially noticeable. Play began be
tween Ellis, '97, and Gage first, but
Sanborn and Bumiller, '97, soon entered
their Court and heLceforth the specta
tors were kept busy watching the two
contests. Sanborn, U. C. '94, won
three sets straight from Bumiller, '97,
the games standing 7-5, 6-3, 6-3
He lost but fifty points to Bumiller's
ninety, and won twenty one to the lat
ter's eighteen. The play was careful at
the beginning, but as the players
warmed up they gained confidence and
the name became swifter and more
accurate. Sanborn's net play won the
contest for him. He uses a moderately
slow chop stroke, but is very accurate
in placing the ball. Bumiller played a
defensive back court game most of the
time. Occasionally he rallied and
showed the brilliant style of game that,
he is capable of playing. The score
was as follows: Sanborn, double faults,
2; aces by serve, 0; passes, 21; out of
court, 24; net balls, 36. Bumiller,
double faults, 1; aces by serve, 0;
passes, 18; out of court, 30; net balls,
51.
Ellis, '97, won from Gage, U C. '97,
the games standing 7-5, 6-4, 1-6, and
o—f. The play was very close and ex
citing throughout. Ellis took the first
two sets alter hard work, the ball cross
ing the net many times during one
point. In the third set he weakened,
but rallied again in the fourth. His
game was well played and showed the
effects of his conscientious practice
since the last tournament. Gage played
a strong, steady, but up-hill game
throughout. The following was the
score: Ellis —double faults, 4; aces by
serve, 1; passes, 24; out of court, 45;
net balls, 46. Gage—double faults, 5;
aces by serve, 0; passes, 23; out of
court, 4l>; net balls, 50. One notice
able feature of both contests was the
absence of strong service, as is shown
by the score of but a single ace.
It was announced that the contest in
doubles would be played off after the
baseball game, but on acount of the
lateness of the hour when the ball
game ended Bumiller, '97, and Cochran,
'96, defaulted to Sanborn and Byxbee,
but played an exhibition match with
them for about forty five minutes, sur
prising the spectators by the strength
of their play.
