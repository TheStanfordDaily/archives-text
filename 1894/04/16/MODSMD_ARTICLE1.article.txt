### 
Rev Dr. Maolaren of the Second
Presbyterien Church of San Jose de
livered the sermon in the chapel yester
day morning, to an appreciative congre
gation in which were many visitors.
The following is a short synopsis of his;
sermon:
Text, verses 24 28, of the 18ih chap
ter of the Acts of the Apostles.
A polios and Paul, the men with
whom this chapter deals are men that
of all others we shou'd study. Their
lives should he examples for ours.
There have been no better examples of
men who have fulfilled their ministry
in the light and word of God. Po not
disregard the teachings of the days long
gone by.
The greatness of A polios well de
serves our study. Above al, lie was
an eloquent man. This of itself was
enough to make him a miahty man in
the world, for there is no accomplish
ment that can surpass this wonderful
power of eloqueuce. It is one of the
powers that every one should strive, hy
the grace of God, to cultivate. Elo
queuce is something that enters the
*oul of man—something that comes
from on high. Ilia mightiest orators
in their finest bursts of eloquence have
been inspired. The true orator must
be brave, for he often has to stand alone
against a great majority. Apollos was
also mighty in scripture, and here we
come to a point that might well be
considered. Apollos was not as well
learned in the scriptures as he might
have been, but what he did know and
believe he preached mightily and with
all his heart. Whatsoever you do or
believe, do and believe it with all your
■heart. Man is made strong by what,
he believes with all his heart and soul
Live up to your beliefs and preach
them with all the impetuosity of your
power. If you believe only in the ser
mon on the mount, live up to it and
vim will find you have a contract
on hand. If in all the range of history,
far snd wide, you "an only single out
one thinu. believe and hold to it, for ir
will lead you on to all truth.
He not ashamed to learn from hum
bler people than yourself, for Apollos,
with all his Alexandrian learning,
preached only of John, until Aquila
a:i I Priscilla, poor peasants of the land,
fold him of the simplicity of Christ's
teachings.
