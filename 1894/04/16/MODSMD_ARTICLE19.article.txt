The intercollegiate tennis tourna
ments have passed and Stanford won as
little glory from them as she well could
and win any at all. This was to some
extent, at any rate, due to the indiffer
ence of'our tennis men themselves. A
few men were tireless in their efforts,
hut the others were listless Next year
the players should beÂ»in earlier, prac
tice mure conscientiou>ly, and settle de
finitely at least a week before a tourna
ment who are to represent them in it.
No more squabbles over who is entitled
to play should arise the day before a
tournament.
