# Harrison and the Christian Association

### 
At the meeting of the Christian
Association in the chapel last night
(Jen. Harrison spoke with the earnest
ness and fine feeling which characterize
all his efforts. The large audience pres
put gave liitu remarkably respectful ami
sympathetic attention. lie spoke, in
part, as follows:
I am very glad that I shall no* leave
Stanford University without spending
an evening with the Christian Associa
tion. If I had done so I should prob
ably have carried away some very wrong
impressions.
I was talking the other day with
Mrs. Stanford—whom I am sure you all
hold in the highest respect and love—
about the one theme occupying h-r
heart and mind : this University She
expressed to me the wish that the re
ligious influences in this institution
might be strengthened. She felt that
whatsoever else might be accomplished
here, unless these young m«'ii and
women whose interest she carries always
in her heart were kept under religious
influence, tho great purpose of this in
stitution would not wholly be accom
plished .
I have received the impression that

you have here in a degree a ser
ious, attentive body of students, having
a strong purpose in view, and that you
are spared in a large measure the pres
ence ol t hat class of students who are
sent to college because their parents are
rich and don't know what else to do
with them, and m> send tl em, hoping
that stronger influences will succeed
where parental control has failed. 1
rejoice in your development of musclc.
I was lad to see Stanford win in base
hall yesterday. lam glad to believe
that you have competent instructors. 1
am glad to realize here tonight from
this delightful meeting of your Christ
ian Association that the moral and re
ligious side is not being neglected.
Tl ere are some old tilings we cannot
dispense with, and among these are
God's word and truth, and those relig
ious influences by which he brings the
heart of man into subjection to moral
law. Don't be ashamed to confess your
selves Christians. To me or.e all-im
portant thing is that we should have a
freer flow of conversation relating to
nature, God, and eternity. I have al
ways had a sort of compassion for those
who think they are wiser than the Cre
ator. There is a God —and if a God.
then a governor, lie has not created
us and flung us out to be the mere sport
of chance and time. But I will not
dwell upon the relation of science to
religion. I will only add that he is as
cruel who attempts to scorn away and
overthrow religion as he who knocks
the crutches from beneath a lame man.
In the observance of the laws of God
and in the promise of the gospel of
Jesus Christ there is the best guarantee
of peace upon earth, and the ouly hope
of eternal life.
