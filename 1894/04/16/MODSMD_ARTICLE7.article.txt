# Harrison's Advice to Young Lawyers.
## 
### 
The seventy or mote law students
were addressed privately this morning
at, their regular recitation hour by Prof.
Harrison. It was the first occasion on
which he had met the law class alone,
and it, was tlie last opportunity lie j
would have before his departure for the
east. As a man of many years' practi
cal legal experience, in addition to ex- :
perience in military and political life,
and as the leading lawyer of the state
of Indiana, his words were listened to j
with the most evident interest. In his
easy conversational style he said:
The law is a noble profession, if it is
nobly pursued. 'J'here is no profession
that has a better code, if we seek it in
its sources. The lawyer is regarded as
an officer of the court; in one sense he
is a part of the machinery instituted by
law for the administration of justice,
lie is challenged in his relation to his
client to the very hi«rh obligation ot
making his interests his own.
Settle this in your minds at once,
that the larger success at the bar can
only be obtained by maintaining a high
and honorable character. This is not
only a source of strength with the judge,
but the same is true of the argument,
to the jury. Lincoln's power with the
jury was candidly conceding those
things which were against him. He
did not, contend incidents and non
essentials ot'ca^es.
The law itself requires profound
study We speak of some lawyers as
case lawyers. I have known some that
were full of cases. When a case was
presented to them they answered it by
a case. I have known some strong men
at, the bar who had this peculiarity, yet
I do not think it is the greatest,
strength. We should answer questions
on principle: not the decision in a case,
but why it was decided so. If it was
rightly decided there was some general
principle. The strongest lawyers I
have ever known were men who were
strongly versed hi the general principles
of the law.

A lawyer should lie well grounded in
his profession before lie begins to pruc
lice; but be should be a student con
tinually until be retires. The great
secret of success wit h a young lawyer
is: a thorough in isterv of bis case, the
first, lie has; to know his facts classify
th?ni thoroughly; then understand and
have carefully arranged the la*". Look
(ill arouitt/ the. cn.se. See what the
lawyer on the other side can say. Study
bow to answer those things that may be
suggested against the position you take
in the case. So prepare every case, not.

'I lie early days of practice will bo
hard for you They could hardly be
harder for you than for me. It has
come to be a settled practice in 011 r
family not to transmit, property, and I
came to the bar with an inheritance of
$S00, which was all that any ancestor
of mine has ever given me, except a
start in life in the way of an education.
I don't know that I can add any fur
ther suggestions. The lawyer in every
community ought, to be something more
than a lawyer. He ought to be an in
fluential member of the community in
which be lives, on the side of justice,
good morals, and right politics.
Now, young gentlemen, with these
few suggest ions, 1 bid vou good bye,
extending to every one of you my hearty
personal good wishes that you may be
successful members of the profession
and loyal upholders of the principles of
morality that are taught us in God's
word.
