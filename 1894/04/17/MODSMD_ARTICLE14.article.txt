University, a democratic exchange al
ludes to ' - t e contempt in which that
term is held by members of his party "

prefix ''professor" before his name is
apt to cxcite some ridicule. Similarly
disrespectful sentiments are at times
awakuued when a ' professor" posing as
a statesman exhibits gross igtorancc of
political economy as applied lo problems
iif statcsma- ship, li'it, the party which
furnishes the larger proportion of col
lege students iri this country, which
pre eminently stands for universal edu
cation, honors all professors who are
themselves an honor to the term.â€” Hus
