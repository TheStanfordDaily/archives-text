# Mrs. Stetson's Lecture. "Art for Art's Sake."
## 
### 
When about sixteen years old I vis
ited «n art gallery in company with an j
elderly gentleman. lie pointed out
some pictures which were truly admir
able for their execution. I asked if he
valued a picture for that which it, rep
resented or for the way in which it was
executed, and 1 had my first lesson in
"art for art's sake" when he said, ''The
way in which it is done."
Why not go on and say religion for
religion's sake, poetry for poetry's sake,
music for music's sake, and most com
mon of all, talk for talk's sake. This
last instance is perhaps the most patent
as illustrating the intrinsic absurdity of
my subject. From speech to song,
frum poetry to drama, from one form or
degree of art to another, our war-cry
must hold liood or must he proven false.
The poem, the picture, the novel
which is produced simply to relieve
one's mind is not the masterpiece which
moves the world. The real poet is the |
one who has brought forth that which,
while it relieves his desire to produce
something really artistic, is of service
to man, for only that work is good
which helps humanity to grow, imagine
any man devising, planning, and build
ing for the simple purpose of relieving
his mind!
Individuality is ours only by virtue
of racial relations to each other. We
are different from one another that we
may serve one another. The artist sits
himself apart because of his high place,
ho ding his art as a guide. ''Art for
art's sake," he c.'ies devotedly, uot.
I knowing th it there is no such thing in
the universe as an unrelated fact.
[t io easy to see how we have fallen
into this error One of the first of
j human processes is the arrangement of
related ideas and action. To find pleas
j ure in action is the very earliest con
sciousness. All the laws that govern
physical developeim-nt work similarly in
the development of any human function.
There is an advantage in doing things,
but there is a higher advantage in do
ing things in accordance with prescribed
designs.
One of the functions of human life is
ait, and is to be valued a* such. With
the advantage of effort and the advan
tage of success, wi'h the especial glad
ness of serving higher eeds and higher
life, that gladness carrying the grand
humility and passion of faithful service
—so should the artist serve mankind
through his ait In "art for art's sake"
we have before us a phase which con
veys a falsehood. This falsehood actu
ates great numbers of people, and exer
cises an injurious and narrowing infiu
cnce upon all art itself.
