Kditor Daily Palo Alto:
Isn't it about time that we substitute
some more rational expression in an
nouncing the death of a person than the
customary one which is inaugurated by
ignorance? The words :hat, relative to
the death of a fellow student, appeared
a lew days ago in this paper are the
more glaringly inconsistent with modern
thought when considered in connection
with an ••xt.ract from an excellent lecture
in a thoroughly modern and scientific
spirit. That extract appeared in an
earlier number. I might also call your
attention to the words of one of our
philosophers who, in speaking of the
Midwinter Fair, said thai, ifa course al
the Stanford University did not enable
the student, by viewing t.i.e Fair, to ap
preciate better the differentiated con
dition of human life, such student could
not claim to be educated.
How would that statement apply to
those who are not able to look through
the dark fog of inherited custom and
see that the course of natural events is
the cause of death, and that the tradi
tional "it has pleased God to remove,"
etc , is sufficiently absurd to be buried
by 'he spade of the evolutionist?
I am not unconscious of the storm
that, consequent upon this, with the
words "iconoclast, crucify him," will
hurl the very tiles oft' the roofs and
reverberate beyond the pine dotted hills.
I pray dismiss the jury; I plead guilty
as charged, and being accustomed to
that kind of punishment, shall take
crucifixion with a serene smile.
Respectfully yours,

The above letter was found in the
I coat pocket of a body excavated in the
hills about two and a half miles from
here They« ung man had evidently
been buried by a landslide. Upon his
forehead was a conformation that seemed
so strange as to be almost ghastly. It
was in the form of a cross. Hy close
I inspection it proved to be a very large
cross wrinkle filled with a bright red
earthly substance. The letter was
plainly intended for this paper, hut
whether it was published or not would
jof course now be impossible to know,
;as you do not keep on file papers from
five hundred years ago.
