enviable work in the Angora literary

teaching, and a second year as pastor's
ussistant in Oakland. She entered
Stanford as a junior. One of her
chief recommendations as a speaker and
debater is her discriminating and pro
fuse handling of facts. Every point
she makes is backed up by the recital
of an appropriate condition or act. She
uses few gestures and speaks in a clear,
pleasing, and well-modulated tone of
voice. Her personal appearance on the
floor also has much to do iu winning
her hearers to her side.

Wolf, and M. V Samuels, all of'94

and teaching district schools in the
winter. He is clear and forcible and
is given to a calm presentation of his
facts and figures.
Mr. Samuels, who will lead for Ber
keley, represents the city of San Fran
cisco on the debate, being a native son
and continuous resident, of that city
He is a wonderfully quick thinker and
has a fine command of language. He
uses excellent English.

Mr. Wolf comes I'rorn Stockton,

He was vice president of the national
convention of Republican Clubs which
met in Louisville in 189-3. He is a
very strong speaker, and, like our
own representative, Mr. Doherty, waxts»
very eloquent in his speeches.
Berkeley is making much out of the
fact that all of her representatives are
Calfornians while all Stanford's man
come from the east. This condition of
affairs however will not affect the
judges.

iner is a beauty. It is composed of
sterling silver and will be hajdsomely en

library building of the Uuiversity of
California will be engraved and upon
