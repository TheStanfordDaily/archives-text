It is very unfortunate that Stanford
has two contests to engage her attention
next Saturday evening. We refer to
the intercollegiate debate and the polo
match. It would have shown much
more college spirit if those who are get
ting up the latter event had arranged it
to come off on some other evening, say
a week later. The debate has been
scheduled for the 21st inst. for over a
month and there is no excuse for the
action of the polo players in infringing
upon the, rights of the debaters and
of those who may wish to attend the in
tercollegiate contest.
