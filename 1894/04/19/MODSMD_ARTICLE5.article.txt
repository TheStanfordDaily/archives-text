## 
### 
About forty representative professor
and students met iu tie chapel las
evening to discuss the organization of a
branch of the American Anti-Spoils
League. The name of the organization
implies its purposes —the purification of
politics, the elimination of the old shib
boleth "To the victors belong the
spoils'' from the platforms of our parties
and the policies of our officials, and the
carrying out of our present civil service
reform laws. Prof. Anderson called
the meeting to order and made a short
speech detailing the objects of the pro
posed organization and the work that
might be accomplished right round
the University. Speeches were also
made by Profs. Warner, Brun, Lathrop,
and Eliott. A committee of five con
sisting of Profs. La'hrop and Ander
son, Jenness.gr.,Kirtland,gr.,aiid Cham
berlin, '95, was appoiuted to draw up a
constitution to be submitted at the next
meeting. Nearly all those present
signed their names to a roll and signi
fied their intentiou of taking a part iu
the future doings of the club.
Those who may wish to become mem
bers of the league are expected to sign
the following pledge, copies of which
are sent out by the genetal officials of
the league:
We hereby declare ourselves in favor
of the complete abolition or the spoils
system from the public service—be
lieving that system to be unjust, un
democratic, injurious to political parties,
fruitful of corruption, a burden to leg
islative and executive officers, and in
every way opposed to the principles of
good government.
We call upon all in authority to ex
tend to the utmost the operation of the
present reform laws; and by additional
legislation, to carry the benefits of the
met it system to the farthest practicable
limits under our national, state, and
municipal governments.
