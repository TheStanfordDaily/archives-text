# BASEBALL TOMORROW.
## The
						Varsity Plays Its Second Game With U.C. on the Berkeley Campus. 
### 
Tim Var.sity baseball team leaves on
i8:-'}0 train tomorrow for Berkeley
where the second game of the series
with the University ol California will
be played. The game will be called at
I:»J sharp in order not to conflict with
the debate in the evening, and a charge
of tweuty-five cents will be made to
everyone. It is likely that a <:reai
crowd will be attracted from San Kian
cisco and Oakland, in addition lo tin
students from lierkelev; and as wo get
half the gate receipts the prospects are
goo 1 that a comfortable surplus will
remain in the treasury to the credit of
the baseball account instead ol a def
icit, as heretofore. If tlie U. (J. wins
another game will be played somewhere
to settle the championship, but if not
this wi I be the last gone of the series.
The grounds at Berkeley are excep
tionally fine, both intiold and outticld.
The chances are that we will play them
the game we are capable ol —a lust,
hard, accurate game. The Varsity
team will be made up as follows:
Pavey, c; McLaine, p; Walton, 1 bj
Bumiller, 2 hj Lewis, s s; '•$ b;
liarrelsou, I f; Sheehan, c f; <J. Down
ing, r f.
I he Berkeley team will probably be:
Morden, p; K. Elston, c; Goslinsky,
1 bj Dunn, 2 b; Simpson, 3 b; Heller,
s s; Dodge, 1 f; Johnston, c f; J.
Elston, r f.
