It itj generally understood that one
or two of our fastest bicyclists will not
enter in the intercollegiate contest at
Berkeley, because of another race in
San Francisco the same day, and he
cause, forsooth, we are sure of the in
tercollegiate race anyhow, even though
all the best men do not enter
Why sure? We are sure of noth tig.
This spirit of forever underestimating
the strength of our opponents Iris been
the weakness of Stanford athletes since
their first great unexpected victory over
the U. 0. in football; aid it is as la'al
to heathful athletic development as its
opposite: overestimating an opponent's
strength, and so feeling it useless to
work hard fora hopeless event. Such
extremes, or any attitude by our athletes
approaching them, must be altogether
harmful. Hopeless though the intercol
legiate field day as a whole may teem,
sale as any one of its events may seem
it is surely the uuty of everyone to
pull according to his strength, be that
great or small, for the honor of the
University he represents —and to take
neither victory nor defeat for granted
The Associated btudeuts should own
the University presses. The small j.»b
press used at present and the whole
office outfit ol type, etc , are owned by
the student printer. This press is not
adequate to the successful and rapid
issue of this paper, or of the larger one
which may be put forth next year, for
hut one sheet can be printed at a time,
whereas with a cvlinder press the whole
edition could be run ofl' in a few
minutes.
As it cannot be hoped that a student,
who devotes his spare hours to the pur
puit of a livelihood will purchase such a
press—tiiking the chances of getting his
money back when he leaves college—it
would be a commendable undertaking
for the student body, if next year's
Athletic finances warrant, to begin the
purchase on the installment plan of a
suitable press, so that not only the daily
but the Sequoia also can be published
on the campus. Then more work can
be assured to students and this Univer
sity can have the reputation of issuing
« weekly and a daily paper upon which
oil the work, typographical, editorial,
and otherwise, is done entirely by stu
dents The daily has such a reputation
row, and in this respect is unlike any
ether college daily,
A suitable cylinder press would cost
about two thousand dollars. It, could
be rented to the printer and thus made
tr> yield a small source of interest on a
praiseworthy investment.
