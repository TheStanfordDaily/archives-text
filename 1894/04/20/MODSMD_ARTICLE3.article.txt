Editor Daily I'alo Alto:
As the editorials published in the
Daily Palo Alto a short time ago
have placed the Glee Club ill a false
light before the University public, it
seems fitting that something should be
said to correct any wrong impression
that may have been made.
The club is condemned for charging
twelve dollars for its services on Stan
ford D iy at the Fair. It is urged that,
as the club incurred no ureater expense
by Ringing than it would have if it had
not sung, and as the success of the or
ganization is due in large measure to
the bieking of the University name,
therefore the services should have been
rendered gratis. I grant the truth of
the reasons offered, but deny the uni
versal truth of the conclusions drawn
from them. If the organization had
been in good pecuniary circumstances at
the time, there should nut, and probably
would not, have been any remuneration
Mskou for. liut, admit iog the desir
ability of such an orgmiizitinri in the
University, if its existence was, or
seemed to be. in danger on account of
financial failure not brought about bv
carelessness or extravagance, the club
was just fied in demanding pay, andes

pccially when the amount charged wa.»
a mere fraction of what the services
were worth.
Let us see what were the conditioni
and prospects of the Glee Club m
time the charge was made. There had
then been three concerts given oil tin
campus this year. The first of thest
was at Stockton under the management
and financial responsibility ot the Ath
letic Committee. The fare from San
Francisco to Stockton was only twer.ty
five cents, and the club came home in a
second-class car. Vet the result was a
loss of about seventy dollars. The
next concert was given for charity in
Oakland. On this occasion the club
got only its expenses paid. The last of
these entertainments was presented in
San Jose, the nearest city to the Uni
versity, and, therefore, the place where
it might reasonably be expected that
the club would make money, if it were
possible for it to unke money any
where. Hut the result of this trip was
a loss of ne irly forty dollars, whi'jh had
to be sustained by t he individual iiiom
hers. It is true, however, that, on this
last occasion, the club stopped at a
first class hotel. Hut this made little
difference in the amount of expenses,
for only two tueils and a night's lodg
ing were had there
Soon after this a concert was given
in the ehapel, and enough money was
realized from it to square up the debts
of the club and leave a balance ot about
forty-five dollars in the treasury.
11, was under these conditions that I
two alternatives were presented to the)
club—to hazird an Eister trip or to j
disbanl. Experience seemed at firstl
to dictate that it would be unwise to
take such u trip; and the prevailing
sentiment was in favor of disbanding. !
Hut it was finally decided to t«y again.
J'ist as the club was about to start on
this ten-day E ister trip, with the pro')-:
ability of having to assess its members
ten or twelve dollars each before return-1
ing home, the twelve-dollar charge was!
made to help pay expenses. Was not
the club justified in this action?
1 he result of the trip everyone
knows. Hut had it not been for the
faithful work of the business mairiger,
Mr. Cox, and his assistant, Mr. I'mk
liaiii, in thoroughly pi •lining the ven
ture some time beforehand, and also
lor the fact that the club stopped at
second-class and third class hotels, the
result would have been far different.
And had it not been for the assiduous
(Sorts of Mr. Haker as leader, the club
would not have been able to exist this
year; for, under the circumstances, a
professional leader could not have been
employed
The writer of one of the editorials
referred to seems to begrudge the elub
the three hundred dollars which it
earned on the trip, and to imply that
the money should be given to some
other orgauiz itiou. Other organiza
tions have parsed subscription papers
round the campus; but the Glee Club
never has. Most of the athletic orgau
iz itions furnish their players with suits,
apparatus for the game, and a coach
when one is needed. Whenever the
Glee Club has employed a professional
leader or rented a piano for use in the
practices, or bought music, the individ
ual members have paid for it; and each
has also been under the necessity (if
providing himself with a dress suit
Why then should the Glee Cub,
whose members have been to consider
able expense, uive the money, which
has been saved by s'opping at tliird
cmss hotels, to another organiz. itiou,
whose members have been to little or
i no expense; to be squandered in keep

ing their teams in first, class style '(
And why has the Glee Club been at
tacked rather than some other organiza
tion ?—for the Mindjliu Club and
the baseball team each received money
for their services on Stanford Day at
the Fair. And also the students were

Was the team at any greater expense
by playing than it wouhl have been
if it had not played? Yet, if the ath
letic organization were in need of
money, it was justified in charging the
students, and the gei oral public. For

did. .1. A. Gunn Jr.
