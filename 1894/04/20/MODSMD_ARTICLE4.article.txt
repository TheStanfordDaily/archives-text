[We do not agree that the Glee Club
was justified in charging the student
body for services on Stanford Day.
The loss of seventy dollars on the
Stockton trip was borne not by the
Glee Club, but by the student body
through its athletic association, which
took the club along with the second
eleven; and even though tho returns
from the concert were not adequate to
the club's expenses the general deficit
might nave been much less if expensive
carriages had not been hired for the
football parade.
With forty-five dollars in the treas
ury, no present indebtedness, and a
good name to make a trip under, the
club can hardly t«e said to have been in
a precarious condition. Each man in
the Glee C'ub had to be provided with
a dress suit, but many of them already
possessed one.
We are not unconscious of what the
club has accomplished through the
hard work of its leader and the thrift of
its managers, and we believe that their
economy in this year of financial de
pression teaches a lesson that might
well be followed by regular student
body organizations.
That, the case of the baseball team
and its chargesis analogous to that of the
Glee Club is not char to us. The base
ball team is a representative of the stud
ent body and its individuals go in for
love of the sport and for the glory at
tached to membership on a V irsity team.
Whatever the past may have shown in
regard to the inability of baseball
to pay for itself the fact has remained
that whenever it. should make anything
it would go to the student body »th-
Ictic fund, and not to the players—-ED
