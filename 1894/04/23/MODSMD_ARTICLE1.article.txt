# BERKELEY BEATEN AT BASEBALL.
## The 						Fifth Successive Victory; an Exciting Contest. 
### 
A return baseball game was played
on t lie U C. cam pus Saturday after
noon, and Stanford retains the eh a in -
pionship I'ur the year. The game was
somewhat of a repetition of the one of
the previous week; as before, ihe Stan
ford team played just well enough to
win. Stanford had hut few repre
sentatives on the grounds, and many ol
the spectators came for the Reliance
field day contests near by, and lingered
to watch the ball game.
This recent victory makes the fift
straight game that has been won by the
Varsity nine from the blue and gold in
the last two years, and a sum total of
six games to the U. C.'s one during the
three seasons that our boys in the red
sweaters have gone upon the diamond.
Shcehan started off wiih u grounder
past short. Lewis knocked the ball
clear over Klston's head, and the two
runners circled the bases before the
ball was returned Stanford stoek was
high; but Dyer failed to run up on
Simpson's infi'ld bounder, and the man
was safe. Lewis threw Putin's grounder
over Walton's head, and Simpson
scored Then Ilarrelson misju iged
Goslinsky's outfield drive, and Berke
ley was one in the lead.
Stanford tied the seore on Harrel
son's infield dribble, MoLaine's drive
past third, and Sheehsn's single. Two
men were caught between bases in this
ini)i 11 McL tine gave two men bases
on balls in the second, and Morden
brought them in with a two bagger.
Then neither side scored fort wo innings
In tie fifth Stanford again rallied.
Dunn juggled Lewis's grounder; I>a vey
plactd a hit between first and second;
Dyer sacrificed Lewis home; heller
muffed Walton's pop up fly; and Bu
miller scored l>avey by a line hit which
struck the pitcher.
Mut Berkeley also obtained two runs
Gosiinsky knocked a hot one past second
base. McLaine did not throw John
ston's hit. and C. Elston scored both
runners with a fly which Ilarrelson
could not quite reach. I'liis ended
Berkeley's scoring, but they remained
two in the lead until the seventh. in
that inninir Walton reached third before
his right field hit was secured. Bu
miller got l.is base on balls. Then both
men came home on Ilarrelson's scratch
hit past the pitcher.
Stanford lorged one ahead in :he
ei.'hth; Lewis slid into first before
Dunn could field the ball and came in
when the centre-fielder let D.ivey's sin
gle slip by him. Nanfoid needed a
cw more runs to make sure of the game
and obtained three in the ninth
oil Downing's single, Ilairelson's base
on|halls, Lewis's-cratch hit, and Heller's
wild throw. The final score was 11
to 7.
Where the Stanford team showed to
most disadvantage was on the bases
This fault of bad judgement, on the
bases—one which has been noticeable
since the first of the season—was re
sponsible for the closeness of the game
The team made seventeen hits fora
total of twenty two bases, stole thirteen
bases, received eight bases on balls,
and their opponents made nine errott :
altogether enough to make twenty runs.
Davey, Weldon (who ran for Walton),
Bumillcr, Downing, and McLainc all
were cauulit once or twice between
bases or in attempting an ill-timed steal
Lvwis alone ran the bases well
As to fielding the team did fairly
well. Shcehan made a "circus" catch

in deep centre and Downing let nothing
fall safe in right field. Dyer, however,
did not play up to his usual standard,
and Lewis made his little wild throw.
McLaine was wild in pitching for the
first few innings, but stead it d <)o"vn.
Gosiinsky and Simpson as usual
played well for U. C. Elston also
showed up strongly behind the bat-
Heller and Dunn made good beginnings
but rel psed towards the end. The
team played better than a week before,
and with i steady pitcher would be
quite formidable.
The seore:
Stanford Varsity.
