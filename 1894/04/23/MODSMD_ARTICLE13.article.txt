Thanks to the faithful work of our
debaters, Stanford lias added another
victory to her lii<t, and another trophy
to her collection, and that, too. when
our opponents were confident of win
ning. They had their choice of sides
in the debate, had established a class,
with this contest solely iu view, and
finally wire to be represented by three
seniors, famous debaters, as against a
junior, a sophomore, and a young lady
from Stanford! Why shouldn't they
win? The livrkt leyan and the Occi
dent will doubtless explain why they
did not.
