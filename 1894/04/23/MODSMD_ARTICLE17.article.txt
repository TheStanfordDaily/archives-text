# TROPHY AND TRIUMPH.
## Stanford Victorious in the Debate. 
### 
Last Saturday evening one not fa
miliar with college customs would have
marveled at the extraordinary appear
ance of the Metropolitan Templein San
Francisco: A hall capable of holding
nearly two thousand people, filled to
ovei flowing; great crowds of handsomely
dressed women wearing or waving long
streamers of blue and gold or cardinal;
and groups of excited young men decor
ated with flowers or bows of like colors,
while a certain indefinite enthusiasm
indicative of some great event shone in
the countenances ot all, from gray
haired sires and matrons who had passed
their three score and ten to youngsters
barely old enough to talk. It was the
occasion of the second annual Stanford-
IJ. C. debate, and the friends of both
institutions were assembled that they
might show their interest in the contest.
At 8:15 pin. the Stanford Mandolin
Club was introduced, and it opened the
exercises with a beautiful selection.
The chairman of the evening, Judge
Seawell of the Superior Court, then
came forward and in a happy and well
timed speech stated the object of the
gathering, and the question of the
evening.
The following was the question under
discussion:
u ßevalued, That the national owner
ship and operation of th•• railroads ol
the United States would better subserve
the interests of the people than does
the present system of ownership and
operation by private corporations.
"It beiii *r conceded — first, that the
change can be made constitutionally
and legally, and at a cost not to exceed
$fi,OOI»,UUO,t.OO, which is assumed to
be a just and reasonable compensation;
and second, that all gov rnment rail
road officials and employes shall be ap
pointed and promoted upon a basis of
business efficiency only."
A. M. Cat heart, '96, opened for
Stanford, lie said in part:
"Kefore proceeding to discuss the
question 1 would ask the judges to ex
amine closely its statement. Note that
it does not read 'Resolved, that the
government should purchase and op
erate the railroads.' It does not advo
cate a revolution, or a change, or any
action whatever. It does read, 'Re
solved, that the national ownership and
operation of the railroads would better
subserve the interests of the. people
than does the present system.' etc. It
simply hypothecates a system of gov
ernment ownership and operation as
existing under cert/iin conditions, and
affirms that that system would better
subserve the interests of the people
than does the present system. In
other words it leaves us to compare
two systems; one real, the other
hypothetical; not to advocate a change
of policy. Furthermore the question
confines us to an existing and not a po
tential condition. Possible improve
ments in the present system are ex
cluded from consideration. Moreover
the negative have conceded as a cer
tainty that all officials and employes
shall be appointed and promoted upon
a basis of business efficiency only. Not
only does this mean a railway service
absolutely free from political influences,
but it also means more efficient em

ployes than those of our private rail
way corporations.
'The power of the railroads is almost
invincible, Riot them out am] in three
weeks millions would die of starvation.
The business success ot' every individ
ual city and section depends upon iheir
caprice. If rates are the same to all
under the same conditions, the indus
trial race will be run by all under or
dinary conditions, and industrial liberty,
which it is the duty of government to
secure for its people, will surely prevail
But if rates are not the same to all
under the same conditions, the race is
unfair and there is no industrial liberty.
''So heavy had become the burden
imposed by discriminations, that Con
gress in 1885 instigated an investigation
of the railroads, which resulted in the
passage of the Interstate Commerce
Law. Ry a decision of the Supreme
Court, that no person implicated in a
case of railway corruption can be com
pelled to testify in any court, the law
has been practically annulled. Evi
dently under the present system indus
trial liberty is impossible.
"Did the government own the rail
roads there would be no cutting of
rates. Government would have no in
vestments to encourage favoritism to
cities and sections. With the rai'roads
belonging to all the people, every man
as a partner would demand fair rates
for himself.
•'The railways are omnipntejt in poli
tics. They elect and contro' officers in
every branch of our government.
Passes arc secretly issued to all public
official of influence to prejudice them
in favor of the railways. Railroads
obtain legislation by the wholesale and
by whatever means. Intimidation as
well as passes and bribery is a favorite
method of dealing with public officials.
The report of a San Francisco grand
jury said with reference to the railway
power: ' It bus debauched both parties
until an honest man cannot, without
fear of contamination, aspire to political
office
E. V. Samuels, '9-1, opened the de
bate for the IJ. C.
lie said: "A Chicago lawyer would
be puzzled to understand how it is pos
sible to interpret the question as has
been done, when two of the concessions
are given the lull details necessary to
protect the affirmative side of the ques
tion. If this idi'a was merely to support
a visionary scheme, I ask you what is
the meaning of the concessions as to
cost of the rai roads '( What is the
meaning of the concessions as to the
reasonableness of this cost, and what is
the reason that they wanted the conces
sion that business efficiency would be
the only basis of discussion ? The
government, should be the great reserve
force to secure justice and impartiality,
leaving to those interested in the busi
nesss full scope for judgment and en
terprise, and freedom of action within
limitations.
"Within its proper sphere govern
ment is certainly a prime necessity of
progress, but when government assumes
functions which properly belong to in
dividuals in ;i private capacity, we may
well say with Herbert Spencer,' They
are governed best who are governed j
least..'
"It is claimed that as a result trusts
and combinations have been formed
detrimental to the rights and interests!

of others. We are prepared to show
j that t!ie railroads ere necessarily guiued
by different principles. Says a recent
monograph on what railroad rates
should he:
"First—Competition with other rail
ways, and especially with waterways,
lakes, rivers, and canals.
"Second—deductions made so as to
induce shippers to compete in new and
untried markets.
"Third—Reductions made on such
articles as will be consumed in larger
quantities as the prices go down. For
instance, the price of oil enabled the
Standard Oil Company to largely in
crease their sales, and it paid the com
panies which carried th.it < il to reduce
rates because shipments were so much
larger in quantity. Nothing can pre
vent the competition of capital Con
solidation will put an end to competi
tion to some extent, but it can never
put an end to that competition which
comes from iticre sed capital; the busi
ness of the age is big sales and small
profit". The railroads mast build up
the country. To «lo so they must re
duce rates. ]»y reducing rates they
increase their dividends because the
transportation is so much greater. Our
average American rates are the lowest
in the world. If the Government,
owned the railroads they would at
times reduce r;.res further than our
private Companies, but they would do so
only to please the masses. The only
way rat 's «•;«ti be reduced is by increas
ing the debt and the debt is already
$G OHI 000,000 by the terms of the
concession. Ihe gentlemen of the
affirmative allenc bribery against the
judiciary, and corruption of <>ur poli
tics We frankly admit that there
have been times when judues have
been bribed, but we maintain that the
weakness of one public official does not
justify the placing of a still greater
• rust in the hands of other public offi
cials As for 'be passes so freely be
stowed, they can hardly be considered
as bribes. We know that many ot our
ministers of the gospel travel on passes,
and certainly the corporation t'uit, has
no soul has no need of the gospel's ai.i
in the courts of heaven."
William Puberty, 'S).V. was Stanford's
next representative, lie began as fol
lows:
"What is our railroad business as i f
exists today? Though a more pleasing
term may he found to designate it, the
only truthful one that I know is. gamb
ling—gambling in stocks. Like all
gambling it has a most pernicious effect
on the morals ol our \outh and tin;
country at large. A cure tor this lies
in the government ownership of our
railroads
"Nearly four billion dollars of purely
paper values have been sold to the pub
lic. It is no secret among those familiar
with railroad values that the bonded
indebtedness of the Erie road represents
alone many millions more than the total
amount, that was ever invested in the
property.
'•The needless expenditure in railway
construction has been estimated at
61,001.1,000,000. In this land of far
famed equali'y tonight many
thousand worthy citizens arc suffering
hunger, cold, and want while a plutoc
racy like that of Carthage sits calmly
looking on.
•'lu the American republic the

wealth producers own less than ten per
cent, of what they have created. But
take the railroads out of the hands of
private corporations and iho exploita
tion for dividends would give place to
the welfare and prosperity of everyone.
Our railtoads have so long sung their
own praises that we have been deluded
into the belief that we possess the larg
est trains, the best coaches, and the
best lines in the world. Our stations
are of ten inconvenient and ugly, our
cars are not as comfortable as second
class cars in Germany, although the
charges there are 80 or 40 per cent,
lower than ours.
"The number killed at Gettysburg
was 5 664, but the number who lost
their lives by railroad accidents during
the year ending dune 30, 1891, ex
ceeded those appalling figures by 13(55.
It is criminal neglect fora company not
to provide greater safety appliances. In
the IT.l T . S. one is killed out of every
3,000,000 passengers carried per mile,
nearly ten times as great a slaughter as
in France. If the people owned the
railroads no opportunity to diminish
this human slaughter would be neg
lected .
"Think of it, the Government to
control 17">,i'00 miles of railway! Hut
remember ths old proverb that tie
'arger the business the simpler the
principle that, can be applied to it.
I'ublie opinion in all countries lias pro
claimed the truth tint railways are
pu'dic highways. Government owner
ship would not be paternalism but co
operative individualism "
Mr. K. M. Wolf. '94, was the next
speaker for Berkeley. lie said:
" I he gentleman who lias just con
cluded told you there was gambling in
railroad stocks, and, therefore, the gov
ernment should assume the immense
task of owning and operating the rail
roads. There is gambling in wheat
and in mining stocks. He tells you
that the government will prevent acci
dents. We are to infer from this that
because the government owns and
operates railroads it will not run over
people who get in the way of the rail
road. lie says that certain men are
hungry, and, therefore, the government
should undertake the railroad, lie
tells ih there are strikes on railroads
owned and operated by private people.
Does lie mean to say ttiar, und*r govern
ment ownership discipline will be so
lax, salaries so high, and hours so short
that employes will not have to strike?
In otln r words, I ask, will public office
be a private snap ? "
Mr. Wolf then described the ex
penses of governments owning and
operating railroads, and said that two
prominent motives had induced Euro
pean powers to undertake the owner
ship und operation of railroads. One
of these was the desire to increase the
political influence of the government,
and the other to make up for the lack of
private enterprise.
"Applying these principles to the
United States one readily sees that the
party in power would get just the ad
vantage that the people did not want
it to yet. The American people prefer
to check administrative power rather
than to extend its influence. It, is well
recognized tha* government officials are
not so economical as the employes of
private individuals It is well known
how unsatisfactory the work of the gov
eminent has been in the matters of im
proving the river- and harbors, and it.
is also well known that the government
has piid Sli.ooo ('OO fora postoffiee
bite that privale individuals could have
purchased for S3OO 1)00. The railroads
are not the enemies of the people
''hey dt] end upon the people tor sup
port, and the people depetd upou
them."
Miss Cora M. I'aimer, '1)5, spoke for
S'anloid as follows:
"We who uphold the affirmative in
argument, tonight are not asking you to
pass judgment on a subject on whieh
you have bestowed no thought air -ady.
nor are we asking you to change your
judgment. You are thinking, working
uieu and women of California, and
alread) know by biner experience the
evils of the presenr system.
"In Prussia, in 1873, there was
found the same rottenness as is found
in our system. Pennsylvania has been
cited as failing instate ownership, but
this was in 1837 when, as evety one
knows, there was failure ail over the
United Mates. The government
should not be expected to do what pri
vate ownership cannot do in averting
universal financial catastrophes. A
signal advantage to be giiued in the
government ownership of railroads will
be found in the preservation to the gov.
ernment of the national banks, by the
mere addition of a debt whieh i.« in dan
ger of being lost. Were the govern
lnent to own the railroads the science of
railroad building and operation would
make tremendous strides. The govern
ment would institute polytechnic schools
as private people cannot, and the prac
tieal science of railroading would pros
per as a consequence; but this is only
one of the manifold advantages of a
similar nature that would result.
"Discrimination is charged against
the present system and cannot be de
nied. Many of you here tonight know
from bitter personal experience what it
means to be crushed by the railroads.
All this will be removed by the pro
posed system, because all tr.iflie will
come through the system any way, and
there will be no need of discrimination "
E. P. Foltz, '94, was the last repre
sentative of U C. He closed as follows:
"I am not surprised to see the affirm
ative urging government ownership with
such energy tonight, because 1 have
understood that next year they must
either charge tuition or sell their rail
roads. However I am surprised that
university students would construct
arguments with such a disregard of the
simplest rubs of logic as our opponents
have. They have enumerated the items
of economic waste in the ptcsent system
and have not noticed the fact that there
is waste in any system. They make the
same fallacy in their argument on dis
crimination and fixing rates.
"Strikes among railroads of private

ownership are comparatively hamiless,
but think of an organized offensive
strike among the railroads under gov
eminent, control It wou'd mean civil
war of an army larger than Napoleon
ever counted.
"In the argument on freight rates
they have taken a few rates hi Kuropc
to show that the rates are lower, but
how do we know that they have not
nicked out ftptcial rates. I'herc is
abundant authority to prove this.
"The only lemedy for monopolies is
to leave private enterprise free and un
it m pe red No monopoly lias been
able to live lor a long time. Kven the
great Standard Oil tru-t lias completely
collapsed. Whenever a monopoly con
trols the market and mguhtes prices
its death is only a matter of time.
"Speaking of eorrupt state com
merce commissions, I should like to
hear of one state having a corrupt
state commission that has not also a
cormpt legislature. This shows that,
no more honesty can reasonably be ex
pected of the government than of the
present, govet omental regulation of the
railroads.
'•The nfiimative have come before
you this evening advocating the com
plete abolition of an old and tried sys
tem fora new and untried system —a
system without the proper sphere of
government, un-Atneri«on and incon
sistent with republican institutions.
We have pointed out. in answer to the
evils they have spoken of that the gov
ernment might easily and has already
in many places successfully regulated
them."
Cathcart, the first on the affirmative,
began bis ten minutes closing speech
by saying that, he could easily under
stand why a man who had spent four
years at the State University of Cali
fornia should think the state was slow
lie then showed that much of the neg
ative's argument was excluded by the
concessions made in the statement of
the question, and the fallacy of other
arguments, ending by reinforcing the
points made by the affiuiative.
The closest interest in thu debate was
manifested during the entire evening,
and several times between speeches the
wild yells of the two universities served
to remind the speakers that their efforts
were being appreciated. The partici
pation of a woman in the debate was
indeed an innovation and added not a
little zest to the evening's interest. No
woman has ever taken part in an inter
collegiate debate on the Pacific coast
before, and to our knowledge none have
ever represented co-educational institu
tions in such contests elsewhere in
America.
When the judges, Judgo Seawell,
Attorney-General Hart, and Hon. Sutn
Knight, gave their decision the greatest
enthusiasm was made manifest. Stan
ford men who had been impatiently

biding iheir time tor three long hours
now nished upon the stag", yelling and
hurrahing, while Berkeley students
were hiding themselves in the crowd
and set-king the rear exits, that they
might shrink out unnoticed.
