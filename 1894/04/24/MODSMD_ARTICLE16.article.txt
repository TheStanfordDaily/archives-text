With the increase of business on
the bus lines to Palo Alto a propor
tional decrease of civility is shown to
their patrons. The equality of western
life is no excuse for insolence on the
part of those rendering services to
others. For the drivers on this route
to find it possible and necessary to be
unobliging in order to assert their inde
pendence is evidence that the propri
etors do not understand the proper way
to prevent competition and secure to
the full the patronage which the Uni
versity can give. This insolence is not
of new growth, but has beeu a source ol
annoyance for some time. Those in
charge of these routes surely do not
need to be reminded of the best way to
remedy this nuisance.
