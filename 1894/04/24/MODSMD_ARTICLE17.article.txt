in the hall were informed that it they
threw out of the windows any person
who in anv way broke the regulations

strictest rules that are in force in the
ball were broken by a distinguished
truest; neither wine or cigars are per
mitted to enter Encina, and now it is

pecially when the consequences are the
loss of a few bottles of burgundy and n
few fine havanas.
