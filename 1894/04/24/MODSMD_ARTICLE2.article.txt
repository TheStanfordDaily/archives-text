# Teachers' Certificates for Stanford Graduates.
## 
### 
Tfie last legislature decided that the
State Hoard of Education of California
should be authorized to indicate certain
of the most, advanced universities whose
graduates should be granted certificates
to teach in this stute willimit examina
tion. I he law empowered the state
board to determine the conditions under
which sueh certificates might be
granted. When the s'ate board met. it
decid< d that graduates of Stanford,
Cornell, and Michigan univetsitles
might be certificated in this stale pio
vided that they were graduates of the
department of education in these various
institutions. AH graduates of the
University of California who are recom
mended by the faculty may receive cer
tificates without examinations. This
has plac?d Stanford graduates at n dis
advantage ill sending teachers out to
fill positions in the state. When the
State Hoard met in Los Angeles on the
14 h of April a petition was brought
before it, asking that the ruling be
modified, and the loud decided that,
the future graduates of Stanford, Cor
nell, and Michigan universities, who
were recommended by the taculty and
who had had professional tiaining
equivalent to that required in the
pedagogical department of the Univer
sity of California, may receive certifi
cates without examinations. The amount

of professional (ruining required by the
University of California is not lesÃŸtliun
six hours per wi ek for the period of dim
year. As the University of Californa
has deeith d that alter January, 1895,
they will recommend none of their grad
uates who have not completed this woik
in the pedagogical department, this rul
ing places Stanford graduates on th<
same ha si* as the graduates of the Uni
versity of California, after January.
1895. Under this ruling all graduates
of Stanford in the present senior class
or in previous years who have completed
six hours per week lor one year in the
department of education and whom the
faculty is willing to recommend may re
ceive certificates to teach in any of the
schools in the state.
