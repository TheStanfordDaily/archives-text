# WORLD'S FAIR VIEWS.
## Yesterday Evening's Interesting and Instructive Entertainment. 
### 
The stereopticon lecture on tin
World's Fair given in the chapel yes
terday evening was one of the best o
the kind ever given at the University
The pictures were c'ear. and follower
each other in rapid succession, then
being no hitches and inexcusable waits
that usually accompany such exhibi
tions.
The chapel was crowded to standing
rooui, 4 and Mr. Treat struck the populai
chord when, in opening his lecture, lit
said:
'•When by a species of mind wander
ing or hypnotism on the part, of Presi
dent Jordan, I consented to deliver
this lecture here, I was overcome by
stage fright, and, taking one of the
students into consultation, 1 asked him
how lecturers were generally favored
here; he said that it' 1 was in sym
pathy with this instituted and its aims
I need have no fear It' that be true,
tlie 11 I have no fear, tor I am not a
stranger to these walls, and grounds,
and trees."
Pictures were then thrown upon the
curtain illustrative of different era
in the construction ot the University.
J he last one ol this series, a beautifuHv
colored picture of the east arch of the
quadrangle, through which was seen
the roof of Eticina in the distai.ee,
c 11 led forth st> rins of applause, above
which sounded the Stanford yell.
After this pleasant introduction the
speaker proceeded with his lecture
pro) er.
"When Jackson I'ark was selected
as the site ot the World's Cnlumniaii
Kx position it was but an area of
swampy ground, with occasional clumps
of sciubby trees. In two years all this
was changed i he swamps became
lagoon*, rivaling in pcturesqueness the
streets ot Venice; and ground that was
once sedgy and uninteresting became
covered with stately but dings costing
in the ag.'rtgate the enormous sum of
OUO OJU. The surest ion which
resulted in this transformation was
made by Mr. Fredeiiek L. Oiuistend,
a gentleman who was associated in lav
ing our. the Lelaml Stanford Jr. Uni
versity. From his idea of utilizing the
lagoons aro-e the scheme of having a
central court, round which were to he
the principal buildings.
••When completed the ensemble pre
sented a magnificent view. From the
roof of the Manufacturies building
stretched a panorama that continued
umil it faded into the horizon. To the
east was the vast expanse of Lake
Michigan, while to the north and east
were the buildings clustering about the'
north pond. I lie latter view seen iroin
the top of the •daiiufacturies and
Libeiul Arts Building was most pic
turesque, i.nd it, was a faseinatiiiir i
to watch the people m the walks far i
below, passing and lepassmg in endless I
numbers, and looking uiore like ants,
than human."
One hundred views were shown iilus
trating in the main the larger and
more striking scenic ■ ffecis of the great
white buildings, the beautiltil ami
placid waterways, the statuary, and the
promenades with their throngs of pi o
pie; but several characteristic smaller
scenes on the Midway sop! about the
grounds were introduced. Some ol the
features ot the Pans exposition were
shown for the sake of comparison.
flie California bui ding, the Court
of Honor by night, and the Ferris
wheel, the triumph of an engineers

brought lunli respon
sive applause.
The picture of the Fair by night w i>
an inspiration, and called forth repeated
bursts of applause and admiration. Be
sides the pictorial features, the lecture
was replete with humorous anecdotes
of the Fair, eloquent comments, and
criticisms, and brilliant descriptions of
the scenic grandeurs of the greatest ex
position the world has ever seen.
