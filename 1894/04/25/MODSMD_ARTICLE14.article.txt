The students living in Encina Hall
feel that it is their as members o!
a co-operative boarding club to beyiven
a detailed rather than a general monthly
report of the finances handled by their
committee. The original arrangements
providefor three committeemen; but a
vacancy long existing on the committee
has not been filled, much to the dis
satisfaction of many ot' the boarders,
who believe that if there is this oppor
tunity for remuneration or saving to
some student in the r number, it should
not be withheld. And, too, it has been
suggested that an auditing committee of
three might further the interests of the
boarders, and contribute towards a more
public knowledge of the business inter
ests of those who form the club.
