### 
Stanford Has Twenty-three Entries.
The annual intercollegiate field-day
between Stanford and the University
of California will be held next Satur
day on the Berkeley athletic grounds.
The sprinters and other athletes of
Stanford have been training a little, as
the facilities would permit, with the
result that there will be twenty three
entries from here and about thirty five
from Berkeley. Probably less than
four fifths of all those who have entered
will, for various reasons, compete. On
account of the 44 financial stringency"
which is felt at Stanford as at other
places, the members will have to pay
their own railroad fare to Berkeley and
return. The amounts will, however, be
refunded after the field day. A re
duced rate has been secured for all
those who may wish to atteud the
events.
