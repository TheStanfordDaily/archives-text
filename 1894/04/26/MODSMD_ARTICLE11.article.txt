\Voodruff makes the follow
ing remarks about the new football
rules: "They won't, charge the game in
any important detail, < xcept, to abolish
momentum plays before ihe ki"k-off,
and sueh plays were merely a fad any
way. Harvard is the only team that
will be greatly affected by the rule.
The amount of life that will be saved
by such a change will be very small.
As to making a kicking game, it is
very doubtful whether any difference in
this respect will be produced All the
kicking possible was done under the
old rules, and there will not be any
more under the new rules. The
changes are not objectionable, and are
a slight improvement, but whoever ex
pects the game to lie radically revolu
tionized will be disappointed."
