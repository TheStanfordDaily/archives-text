# '97 Wins the Ball Game.
## 
### 
As Wiis foretold ut the first of the
season, the strong ireshinun nine
proved victorious over the sophomores
in yesterday's game. It could hardly
be called an exhibition of good base
ball, yet the spectators extracted con
siderable amusement from ilie antics ol
players, who played of necessity, and
uot because of ability.
The outfielders allowed too many bits
to fall between them, and held the
ball to • long on returns. This was
responsible for many of the hits and
runs.
Dyer's absence made the freshman
infield anything but, u "stone wall "
Weldon pitched moderately well
throughout the game. Humiller sup
ported him finely, and played fie only
good game of either team. McLaine
pitched winning hall at first, striking
out eight of the first twelve to face hiui,
but weakened after the fi th inning.
These contests are amusing, but one
would like to see an exception to the
poor exhibitions ol baseball which have

been given on the campus throughout
the season: and this condition is not be
cause of lack of material. Instead of
confidence, our teams evoke our fears.
The score:
