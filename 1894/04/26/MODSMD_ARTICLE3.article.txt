Editor Dati.y I'ai.o Alto:
Under the advice of Dr. Jordan, and
under the protest, of ilte Encina board
ing club committee, the bill for wines
and cigars stolen from G neral Harri
son's apartments in Encina has been
paid. Ir, is proposed that, the money to
pay this will be taken from the guar
antee fund of one dollar, which every
student upon his entrance into Kncina
was compelled to deposit.
As one of such students I wish to
object to any such action. First, be
cause the receipt fur the fund to which
I was compelled r.» subscribe says that
the money so subscribed shall be used
to replace broken furniture belonging
to the University, ami located in E>-
cina N"W are wines and cigars Uni
versity furniture? The entrance of
such "furniture" into the hall is pro
hibited. consequently tl (ire cun be no
valid claim for such University ma
terial if introduced into the hall and
then lost. Secondly, it works an ob
vious injustice on those who have left
the hall since last Septeiub* r. They
have not as yet received any rebate
from their share of the guarantee fund,
and besides must, help pay for "contra
band furniuite" stolen from the dormi
tory, although they may not have been
concerned with it for months Have
the authorities any just right to compel
the students to pay this bill? and e»pe
pccially to pay it fr>>m the guarantee
fund? Is every student who has ever
roomed in Kncina during the past, year
to consider himself as a trustee for all
the valuables of all our visitors and a
sponsor for the safety thereof? Fol
lowing the precedent about to be estab
lished, a visitor may go to Encina, lose
a valuable piece of "furniture," and
compel a student now residing in San
Jose to help pay for it. llespect fully,
