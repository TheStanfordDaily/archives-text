[Investigation at ihe mathematical
department confirms this clipping. It
is an assured fact that we are to lose
the efficient services of Professor Miller
during the oounn<; year. It is to be
sincerely hoped that the new tempo
rary addition to our faculty will prove
to be as genial and as popular with the
great mass of students as is Professor
Miller.]
