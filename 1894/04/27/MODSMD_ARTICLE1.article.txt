ability and accomplishments of the rep- |

which cannot be overshadowed by the I
dissatisfaction of morbid individuals ex-J
pressed in inflited articles, plainly!
show lias set too rapid a pace for them.
In answer to the allegation that
Attorney-General Hart was at first the!
only judge who favored Stanford, and
that it, was only through his persistency
and the clamors of the audience that
ti.e other two agreed to the decision, it
is on'y necessary to state that if tfetke-J

regardless of the other judge's vote.
Herkeley also alleges that Mr. ilart
had an undue influence in the selection
