# BERKELEY WINS A SURE THING.
## The
						Field-Day: 90 to 36 Points. 
### 
Not over twenty Stanford students
in addition to the contestants witnessed
the second intercollegiate field-day on
the U C cinder track Saturday. A
record of 3G points for Stanford to 90
for U. (). as compared with last year's
defeat of 35 to 91 gives our track ath
letes reasou to be encouraged. At that
rate of progression in the year 1922
we will beat Berkeley by one point;
seriously, with a cinder track our pros
pects need not be dark for next year.
If all the men entered from each uni
versity had competed the record of
points won would have varied, but the
totals would have remained about the
same. Twenty one competed for Stan
ford and thirty for U. (J. The follow

Seven interollegate and two Coast

The narrow, almost level track was
not. at all suited to bicycling, which ac
counts for the poor time. Several
Stanford men can cover the distance in
less than five minutes on a proper track.
