# SANTA CLARA COLLEGE WINS.
## Stanford Loses the Best Played Game of the Season. 
### 
The Varsity went to Santa Clara Sat
urday to play a practice gnuie with the
Santa Clara College team, the latter
having drawn out of the Midwinter Fair
intercollegiate league over a month a«:o.
The game was a skillful contest from
beginning to end. and although not one
of the regular Varsity intielders took
part, the team put up the be it, ball ot
the reason The teams were evenly
matched, the score beinu: 1 to 0 in favor
of Stanford at the beginning ot the

sixth inning. The inability of our men
to hit the ball when men were on
bases was the direct cause of
defeat. By a combination of bases
on balls, two hits, and two
errors, the Santa Claras made the entire
six runs in one inning. Sheehan played
a good game at second and was loudly
applauded for his home run drive in
the eighth inning. The Santa Clara
team put up a winning game from the
start and the victory is justly theirs.
The treatment of the team by the
fathers was most cordial, and it remiins
for us to entertain them as well upon
their next visit here. It is possible
that a return game will be played on
the campus next Thursday. The fol
lowing is the score:
STANFORD.
