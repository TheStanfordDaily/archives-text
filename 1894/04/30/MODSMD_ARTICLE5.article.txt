## 
### 
Id room 11, quadrangle, at 3 o'clock
this afternoon the Hoard of Control of
the Sequoia met for the purpose of
electing an editor-in-chief and a busi
ness manager for the coining year.
Prof. Woodruff followed the precedent
established by Prof. Lathrop last year
of deciding that it was preferable that
the faculty member should not vote un
less it was absolutely necessary to settle
a tie between two men He considered
that the position of the faculty member
was more of an advisory one. and not a
discriminatory one between equally
efficient men. In this respect we can
not agree for we believe that the prin
cipal object for the existence of the
board has always been the election, in
which all the electors are expected to
take part.
The candidates for editor-in-chief
were: C. C. Hughes, '95; C. M. Cram,
'96; W. W. Guth, '95; and W. J.
Neidig, '96. Upon the first ballot the
votiuii was as follows: W. W. Guth, 4;
W. J Neidig,!; C C. Hughes, 1.
Guth was declared elected and will
enter upon his duties next September.
He has had consider ible experience in
newspaper work, having been identified
at different times with several San Jose
papers, besides having been on the
stuff of the Sequoia last semester.

The names proposed for business
manager were: A. K. Spalding, '96;
T. S. Warren, 94; O. V. Eaton, '95;
De Wolt, 97; Snyder, '90 O. V.
Eaton w.<B unanimously elected on the
tir.-a ballot. The choice appears a good
one, as the successful candidate has
