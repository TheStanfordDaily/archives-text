# Rev. Dr. Kummer's Sermon on "Saul of Tarsus."
## 
### 
Of all the illustrious characters of
the now testament none stand out so
conspicuously as St. Paul. Ths devo
tion of none of the apostles was so tried
us his.
Let us look at his life a few minutes.
It may not he possible to attain to the
ideals set before us, hut the honest
effort to realize them is fruitful.
'1 he eoura«;e of Paul has always been
to me Itis most admirable trait, lie
astonished the world by his fortitude
and perseverance. But higher than
mere physical courage and rarer than
that, he dared to do unpopular things;
in fact, he never consulted popularity.
This man knew not the word failure.
How such heroes are needed in these
days!— Preachers and editors who have
more bravery than to sell their opinions.
It is just such men as Paul who purify
the moral atmosphere by creating
storms in it.
But this man dared to preach the
despised gospel of the hatrd Jesus.
He was noted for his kindness of heart,
which added yrace to his grandeur and
nude his tab tits at once humaj and
divine Paul wrote fourteen epistles,
all of which are placi d far beyond the
jurisdiction of criticism. He was a
great man by every known standard of
measurement.
He valued his time highly. Show
me a young person who places a great
price upon his time and I will show
you a young person from whom the
world is likely to hear
Another way to measure a man is by
his gilts. It is inconceivable how this
man could have added anything to his
fiif'tfl. The size of a man may be
known by the number of elements be
tween bis purpose and the goal of his
purpose. There are too many who
plant their s'aff down in the soil of this
world not very far in advance of them.
