Much has been heard lately about
the possible corruption of the boards
that elect men to fill the prominent
positions at the disposal of the student
body. It is apparent that by whatever
means a position may be filled, as lotisr
as competition exists there must of
necessity be factions and a conflict of
interests; to hope for harmony and
unanimity in a body where interests
are at times antagonistic, is to expect
something impossible. The cause of
combinations is not to be found in the
fact that boards do the electing, for
factions would exist under any circum
stances, but because these positions arc
worth having and the fact is appreciated
by the candidates, who are willing to
use every available means to obtain
them.
