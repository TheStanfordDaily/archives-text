There is too much opportunity I or
clique management in i lie present
system of election ot' editors in-chief
and business managers of the t S'njuoir
and of the Daily I'alo Ai/ro. Certain
wise provisions in the constitution ol
the daily were made to prevent ilie
selection of a factional majority on ilie i
board; for bin one candidate from each
class can be voted for by an individual,
and the second candiduio receives a
place on the board unyway; so one
faction, should any f-uch political cor
ruption aii.-e, could not be iu the
iunj irity.
'I'lie Sequoia constitution, however,
offers the best possible opportrnity for
political scheming. The several mem
hers oi its board of control ar»s elected
by their respective class organizations.
Now, when a certain fraternity — to cite
a more common example, hue no* to re
flect in any way upon the good intents
and purpose? of such organizations—
secures a member on the board, say in
an upper class election, and by a not
uncommon bit o! excusable ambition
also secures a member on the hoard, say
in one of the lower class elections, is it
not a foregone conclusion that two of
the six student votes en that, boaid will
go as ti e vote of one man 112
Then again, on both boards men are
not always elected because they are in
dividually deeply interested in the pro
motion ol our University papers, in
which probab'y some of tliein take no
interest at all, but because they are
known to be favorable to some future
candidate whose friends put. the elector
on the board. The boards are numeri
cally so small that the petty personal
prejudice of one faction or of an indi
vidual — itid prejudices and "combines"
will exist and vary as long as there is a
political contest—-haspower to overt brow
the most capable candida'e. We do
not necessarily reler to specific or to
immediate causes; we wis'< to typify the
faults ol the system, the inside working
of which we know by experience.
The existence of the board of con
trol as such is all right, but the elec
tion of the editor-in-chief and business
manager might far better be left to the
general suffrage of the Associated Stu
dents; for the larger the vote polled
generally the fairer is the choice of a
candidate. To be sure, such an ar
rangement would leave a choice to a
very large number of disinterested per
sons who by such electioneering as we
have witnessed recently would still vote
uniulelligently; but a general discus

siou of capabilities of the candidates'
loyalty )'i lite micccss of the student
body, which is reflected to the outside
world by the character of the college
papers, could not in the long run be
unfair to the candidates, who, casting
all {'actional prejudice aside, would do
the most lor the publication utider their
charge.
