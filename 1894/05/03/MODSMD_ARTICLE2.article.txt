# "THE STANFORD QUAD."
## The 						First Annual: '95's Production, and What It Will Contain. 
### 
Next week the hum-expected hook
will arrive upon the campus, and when
it does, curio.-ity will cause it, Jura
short time at least, to supplant in popular
consideration even those numerous
other vo nines that must be pored over
before the examinations.
In general terms, the annual contains
about three hundred pages; its dinieu
sions are about seven by ten inches:
the binding is cloth — half white ami
halt'cardinal, and the design, produced
in gold, consists of the name, a small
qu idrangle scene, and ,1 '95." W'lii.e in
in my respects all annuals are to the
general public apparently similar, )ei
this one is fairly unique and character
istic of tlio University. Its aim has
been to present, a typical picture id' the
first, three years of the University his
tory in an agree tide and comprehensive
style without telling that history in
so much prose. As the publishers of
the first, annual it was incumbent upon
the Class of '95 to tell the story of i In
early days of the University, for '95
alone of all the classes that will issue
annuals has taken an active part in all
that helped to make that history.
There is very little literary material
in prose. Short biographies of Mrs.
Ntaiil od, Iceland Stanford Jr., Timothy
Hopkins, and Dr. Jordan, a history ol
the class, a history of Stanford society,
and the prize story, embrace about all
in this line Bur, the volume contains
about fifteen poems, humorous and
otherwise, which are interspersed among
the other material by way of variety
Thirty full-page pictures and about
forty smaller illustrations in half tone
and line work comprise both the ar
tistie woik and reproductions of photo
graphs ol athletic teams, characteristic
sccnes about the spacious campus, and
illustrated ' cracks." 'I he last form
rather a novel feature; 'hey comprise
some twenty individuals whose
I cads are taken from photographs
but whose booies are supposed to be

significant or humorous representations
of the individuals' failings. Rumor
says that Murphy, Applewhite, Kussell.
Campbell, Ray, Cochran. Rurnell,
Ur< ioks, Dray, Rice, and Kennedy are
among the anomalies. In addition to
these, four pages are devoted to short
individual stabs which do not discrimin
ate as to persons. Some members of
the faculty are caricatured.
A complete li>t of the faculty, the
members of 94, the Class of '95, all
the fraternities including their chapter
rolls and local membership, all Univers
ity and student organizations and their
officers, all Varsity teams and their
records—may be found in their proper
places.
The artistic work, which is much
better than that of the average annual,
has been supervised by Fry Produc
tions have also been received from Ely,
Culver, Johnson, Tully, and Hudson.
The editorial staff' is composed ol
nine members elected as an editorial
board by the class: \ Lewis, editor-in
chief; K. I). iWas/ee and A. li. Hiee,
associate editors; 1.. J. Ilin.-dill, statin
