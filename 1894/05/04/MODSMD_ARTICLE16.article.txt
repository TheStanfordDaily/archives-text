M Emortal Day is drawing near, and
Â»s yet nothing lias been decided in re
gard to the annual excursion. Mon
terey seems to meet with the most ap
proval by students and professors as the
objective point for such a trip, even
though a visit was made to that famous
resort two years ago; for so much of in
terest is centered in its neighborhood
that a second visit, would be yet, more
profitable than the first,. Hut, wherever
the excursion goes, those who partici
pate in it will be many times repaid in
pleasure for the slight outlay, and will
gain in addition a better understanding
of the varied scenery and resources of
California.
