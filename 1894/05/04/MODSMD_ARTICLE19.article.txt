The first piece of printing ever done
on the campus of the University of
Chicago Citnu off the new ' University
Press" last week. It, was the Weekly
Bulletin, a small official announcement
of university events on the week's cal
endar. The remarkable thing that it
carries with its formal language and
dress is that it marks the real beginning
of the ' University Press" of Chicago,
and a change to the university itself
from what has been only an agency of
the university—the birth of a "press"
connected with the uew institution that
will eventually become as famous, Pres
ident Harper hopes, as the Cambridge
Press or the Oxford Press. The pub
lishing equipment has been set up in
the long fiat brick building which holds
also the general library and the men's
and women's gymnasiums. Ilere all
the journals, programs, calendars, cir
culars, monographs, and even books will
be printed, or at least set up, for the
<l Pres-s" is not yet, prepared to do the
heavy press work. But the scheme, of
course, contemplates in the future a
power plant and full accommodations
for every kind of printing and binding,
and includes the purchase and sale of
books.—Chicago Tribune.
