# The
						Symposium Tuesday Evening.
## 
### 
At the meeting iu the interest of
civil service reform last week a number
of plans for future work were discussed,
and a committee was appointed to pre
sent suggestions and to draft a constitu
tion That constitution has now been
prepared, and is printed below.
Among the many different opinions
of those whom the committee has
sounded with regard to the civil service
rÂ» form movements at this University
has been found a common feeling that
the league should be broader than an
association for civil service reform
merely, but should also comprise the
cause of good citizenship. In order to
place these opinions clearly and defi
nitely before thy faculty and students,
and to explain the reasons for drafting
the constitution as it now stands, a sym
posium will be given iu tie chapel
Tuesday evening. Dr. Jordan, Dr.
Howard, Dr. Warner, Prof. Hrun,
Dr. hllliott, and Prof. Anderson, will
speak during the evening.
The meeting is in no sense to he con
fined to any one narrow is; no, but will
approach the subject, of political corrup
tion from a standpoint in harmony with
the breadth and dep'h which the pro
posed constitution displays. After the
symposium is ended the latter part of
the evening will be devoted to a formal
presentation of the constitution and or
ganization of the club. The constitu
tion here printed is merely tentative
and subject to amendments when
adopted. Ofliccrs will be elected and

plans and methods for future work will
be freely discussed.
