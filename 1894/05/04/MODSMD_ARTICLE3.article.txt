# Faculty vs. Mariposa Hall Tomorrow.
## 
### 
The faculty basebdl team will play
tomorrow against a team selected from
the denizens of Mariposa Hall. The
game will be called on the new
diamond at 2:30 p.m. sharp. The
makeup of the students' team could
not be definitely ascertained, but will
likely be from the following: Brigus,
(captain), Gifford, p., Foster, Dr.
Myers, Timmons, Bledsoe, Fogg, Piatt,
Crane, and Miller. The faculty team
will be appoximately Angell, p. ami
captain, Ilichanlson, c., Jordan, lb.,
Howard, 2b , Stearns, s s., Wood, 3b ,
Anderson, If., Little, c 112., Green, r.f.
As this is the first appearance of th*
faculty nine this year it should be
greeted with a full house, so to speak.
Those among the old students who re
member the brilliant exhibitions of
baseball our professors used to put up
against the dignified upper-classmen
will need no urging to attend this
game.
It is rumored that this is only the
first of a series of games in which the
faculty will take part, in preparation
for the last great game with the
seniors. Kodak workers are to be dis
couraged in every way possible, but, of
course, a great many snap shots will be
stolen nevertheless, as was done last
year and the year before; for some of
these stolen shots are really worth many
times the risk run in getting them.
