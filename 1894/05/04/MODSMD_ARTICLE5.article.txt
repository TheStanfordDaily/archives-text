# The 						Students' Handbook.

### 
The Studeuts' llanddook for the fall
of 189-t appeared ou the campus today.
It is a book containing about twenty
eight pages of well-chosen information
concerning the University and its en
vironments, published by the Christian
Association more especially for the guid
ance of new students. The title page
was designed by Paul 11. White, '90,
and is a work of art. It represents the
well-known tree Palo Alto, which marks
the northern corner of the University
domain and from which both the estate
and the town of Palo Alto took their
names, with the old wooden railroad
bridge over the San Prancisquito Arroyo
in the foreground. One of the unique
features of the publication is a map of
the quadrangle, showing the location of
the various rooms and the scheme of
numbering them. There is also a rail
road mapof thebayandtheCoastDivisiou
which may be of service to strangers.
Taken as a whole the little vsluuie is a
credit to the University and will be found
of real value by new students, and by old
ones' to answer many questions usually
asked by friends concerning the campus
in an entirely satisfactory manner.
Several thousand copies have been
printed, and they will be distributed
from the registrar's office to those who
wish them.
