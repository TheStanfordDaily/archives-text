Editor Daily Palo Alto:
We perceive that in spite of "Keep
off the and whacks from the
Daily Palo Alto, sundry students
coininue to go inside the flower beds,
there to sit and enjoy the cool shade
and the seclusion afforded by the shrub
bery .
Now this obviously natural and ob
viously harmless tendency provokes the
inquiry, Why not? Supposab'y these
beds are tor the pleasure of the people,
and the wisest use of them is that
which makes them yield the most
pleasure. And certainly it is pleasanter
to sit under a palmetto bush and look
out over the hot asphaltum than it is
to sit on the hot asphaltum and look at
the palmetto bush. Moreover, a bush
is none the less ornamental for having
a jouth or maiden—or even both of
them—under it; on the contrary, it is
prettier tint way. In short, it would
seetn that the best use of the six so
called "flower beds"—more properly
oases, in the desert, with springs and
palm trees—is to consider and use
them as little parks, in which to sit
embowered and while away ati odd hour,
learn a lesson, have a little visit—or
write poetry for the Sequoia. By the
addition of a little thought and gravel
the space within could readily be dif
ferentiated into cultivated areas around
the plants and graveled areas for folks.
The flowers round the edge could have
places left for going in and coming out,
and these would be respected perfectly.
Nobody wants to harm the greenery —
ouly, why not make the most of it?
