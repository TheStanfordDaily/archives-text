# The
						Faculty Victorious.

### 
The faculty baseball team made its
long-expected appearance on the field
of battle Saturday and carrisd off a
well earned victory from the crack(ed)
nine of iMaripo-a. There is not the
slightest doubt of the superiority of ihe
faculty, even though certain persons
liave gone so far as to hint that the
Mariposa team did not put up its usual
brilliant frame. The steady team-work
of the Mariposas could do nothing as
against the heavy slugging of the fac
ulty. For the faculty, Professor Rich
ardson's work behind the bat in handl
ing Mr. Fish's sizzling twists aud shoots
was very commendable. Dr. Jordan
caught, a difficult foul fly. Dr. Angell
and Dr. Wood were very active on the
bags.
It was a very sultry afternoon, but a
number of enthusiasts, auiusement
huuters, and professors' wives sat on
the bleachers or on the yrass round
the field, aud watched the and lis
amusing features, among which uiitiht
be mentioned Foster's ability in hand
ling grounders after the fashion of a
Chinaman plucking clover out of a
lawn; Professor Anderson's scheuiiug
fora base on balls; Dr. Myers's clan
Alpine costume, or the lost garter;
Ciaue's juvenile kite flying runs after
the elusive fly; aud Dr. Jordan's lack
of a long coat.
liledsoe of Mariposa distinguished
himself by his lightning one-handed
pick ups and throws. Giflord's work
in the box was a feature after Foster
bad retired on account of slight wilduess
due to eufbrced absence from the ball
field.
