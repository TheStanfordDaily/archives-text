iieligiou is of little value except as ii
helps us 1 u our present work and relat
ionship toward each oilier and toward
our God. My religion is concerned
very little with the future immortality;

The kingdom of G&od as it occurs in
the text. must, be taken in a wide sense
While there is something special con
templated in the phrase, it is nevertho
les true that the kingdom ol God em
braces all wisdom, knowledge, truth,
and misunderstanding. You are seek

)ou ever thought ol it m that, light or
not. That is the of all scien
tific study. When we enter into the
practical fields of the world and seek
to make them productive, we are still at
work hi the kingdom of God. We are
following ills law, and working in
partnership with llim; our snece.-s or
failure is m exact ratio with llis will

It has been said that practical eco

will never get any economic system
that will prove permanent and satisfact
ory that has not a great, deal of religion
in it. The reason why nios'.economiusys
tems fail so miserably is because the main
point is ignored. Men think Uiey must
go to work and invent something to
satisfy their own relationship, overlook

many centuries ago and accompanied
by a wonderful promise.
Sometimes people ate puzzled how to
go to work to worship God. Love your
brother whom you have seen and jou
will learn to love God whom you have
not seen. Learn to pray sincerely, for
there is no lie half so sacreligious as an
insincere prayer.
