It is a pleasure to be able to make a
note of the marked improvement in the
Sunday evening services. The last two
deserve special mention. One of the
speakers having authority referred to
the factional and political features at
taching themselves to the student body,
arid considered them highly beneficial
when the contests are carried on in uti
honorable way. It is gratifying to heur
such statements at a time when
denunciation of every thing is rife that
has the slightest appearance of con
certed action.
