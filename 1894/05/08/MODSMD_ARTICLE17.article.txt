If the exercises on Memorial Day
are successful, a precedent will be es
tablished of giving over to the student
body the preparation of a program for
its fitting observance. This is some
thing highly desirable, since in all like
lihood the ambition to obtain a promi
nent place in the exercises of the day
will be one of the greatest incentives to
hard work that has yet been presented
The honor of being selected as fit to
fake part will also come to be recognized
as the best possible reward for industry.
It is understood that the faculty intend
to take charge of the exercises on
Founders' Pay and desire to leave the
program for Memorial Day to a very
large extent in the hands of the stu
dents.
