Stanford is to have a new paper—
that, is, unless something happeus to
make if unnecessary. Its name lias
not been decided upon. Its manage
ment can only be conjectured, lint
about ten days ago a movement was
quietly started, and has met with un
expected success, with the object of
establishing here a literary bi monthly
or weekly which would represent in
some measure the student budy, and tin*
ability of the large number of contrib
utors in this University. Nothing def

management, but it is claimed by those
at the head ot the movement that the
unqualified support of the most prom

gained for itself in the beginning, it can
not help but be successful, and the
University be in a way to have a liter
«ry paper which will hold its own with
literary publications iti eastern univers
ities.
