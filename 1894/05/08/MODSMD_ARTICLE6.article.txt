## 
### 
Mrs. Campbell, one of the foremost
women of the day on questions o! do
mestic poverty mid the wane work of
woni'ti, spoke to a lull etisipel tins
afternoon. Instead of speakijg on
"Women as NVajie Karners" as an
nounced, she spoke on '•Culinary Kdu
eation." In speakiin; of the nervous
disjases occesioned by improper fjud,
she said:
Tlieie were ancients who lie'd that
ilie soul baa its seat in the stomach.
We ate slowiy opening our eyes to tiic
laet that in tins belief lies a deeper
meaning than we know. It is, in Bhort,
the stomach that is the central point
Continuing she said : Were the condi
tion of the poor workingiiiaii bolter he
would never be compelled to visit the
liquor houses lor cheering,
lint in homes of a'l kinds, and espe
cially the richer class, t here is not much
<11 lieicnee. As a i>a ion we consume
more sweetmeats and delicto es ot all
kinds than any oilier nation in the
Win Id From Maine to California
house-bold cookery is absoluiu'ely
bad. Here wo find in brief
the reason why in nil our fanning dis
tricts throughout the United Sates we
find a type of women who are respons
ible for and numbered anions the major
ity of the inmates of our insane asylums.
She is the unbeautiful result of the
chocolate cakc and lemon pie associat
ion .
IVunostic service is also a question
now agitating the country. It, is a well
known fact that good service le.-setis
year l>y year It, is trainin<r that is
needed. Training might be a compuls
ory part of all education. It is my
opinion that every phase of this work
should he put upon an educational basis.
It should be a trainiriir that should have
its place in the public schools, and
should begiu in the kiudergurteu.
