# Anti-Spoils Symposium; and Formation of Stanford Good Government Club.
## 
### 
A crowded chapel listened to the!
symposium held last evening under the
nuspices of the recently organized Ami-
Spoils Club. Prof. Lathrap occupied
the chair.
The first speaker of the evening was
President Jordan, who was greeted with
great applause. He said in part:
I suppose in a general way that the
reason we have governuient is to secure
justice, that there may be fair play, and
that we may bring about personal secur
ity. Another purpose is to accomplish
those things which individuals cannot
accomplish by themselves.
Now a good many d.fferent kinds ol
government have tried at one time 01
another and have been comparative
failures In foreign lands even this
representative government of ours has
been a comparative failure, and they
thought they would give it another trial
and iu a new place. When you have
one ignorant man, all well and good;
Lut there is no virtue in collectiveignor
ance. So it was supposed that the
wisest men should be chosen to make
their laws. Ignormce should not be
repiesenti d by ignorance} only the best
shoul 1 be put forward. So they insti
tuted a system of electing to choose the j
best A government, must be a eouipar
ative failure if it does not in some way
or other secure iis wisest men to make
the laws It must lie a failure if the
laws 111 ide are not. wise and good.
Every problem must, be solved aright, in
the long run. Every wrong answer is
like a festering sore; it is like some
foreign element injected into the body
of politics They enslave their chil
dren's children who make compromises
with sin.
It is one of the remarkable things
that all our early state papers were so
finely written. This was because the
colonial representatives were 111 a large
degree the wisest men. Alas, we can
not say so now. Our representative
government has been mi a large degiee
a failure. Hut there is no better kind
of government to fill hack upon.
Tiiere is too much development ol
inefficiency in America. U'e have
wicked men in tins country trailing
upon forms and freedom How a iree
Country is going to get out of that I
don t. know Hut as we are heirs to all
ages in science, we are also heirs to all
ages in rascality. 1 suppose such men
as .lay Gould, for instance, could have
given pointers to Julius Caesar Thete
are gathered together bodies of men in
association* and orgunzitions for the
express purpose of preying upon the
public. Every co inty thi'iiighout the
country has its little or hig T.mini my
iia'l, depriving the country of as uiiioli
of its prosperity as it can.
Had civil service is not altogether
American. It, is somewhat like the
Feudal system, except that the lords
fail to deliver the goods they get. Part
of the defect of our civil service system
is the incompetency "112 its officers. We
don't seem to recognize the fact that
the choosing of good judiciaries and the
bringing about of go id results are mat
ters of a good deal <,112 trial I know of
Inany men in office who have in their
keeping great sums of money, but who
wi u d never be trusted even with a
Ismail amount by their friends.
An anecdote comes to me of one of
Hie senators from Pennsylvania. A
man one • applied to him for an appoint
ment, to some office. lie brought, with
him excellent papers of reference, and
there seemed to be good evidence that

the man was well qualified. Hut the
senator told him that beside his clerk
ship duties he would have to perform
at odd hours certain duties of one kind
or another that had to be attended to
beside his regular government, work.
The man said lie would do anything he
could conscientiously do. Whereupon
the senator turned upon him and said,
"Well, you have one el" them things,
have you
It was my fortune once to be a gov
ernment official without pay; not that
I wis not a piety fair official, but that
if I had a paid position, there would
li.-ive been plenty of schemers after the
office. !n> it has been the policy of the
grvernment to get men in certain re
sponsible positions who would work
without pay, or for a very nominal sum
Dr. Jordan reviewed the spoils sys
tem as seen in the Sini 1 hsoniuti Insti
tute, and other government institu
tions, and in conclusion said: These
are illustrations of the failure of the
system to do any good whatsoever. It
is this tiling carried to a larger degree
that enables men only who have prac
tical politics to come to the front.

Dr. lUss then spoke on Partisanship:
.My talk this evening will have to be
theoretical—l have never been in one
place long enough to be entitled to
vote.
My first proposition is that we must
have two parlies; two paities belonging
to democracy, as the party system lie
longs to democracy. People who kick
against, the pariy system are people who
don't, want democracy, but. want to go
back to the med.aeval system. In con
tinental countries, where democratic
institutions are 3011111:, they have in
their parliaments six, eight, or ten
parties. The result, of having factions
is that the government must, always
maintain for its measures a majority 111
the assembly, and this from a coalition
if two or three of the factions. Jiuch a
coalition is a mere matter of giving and
taking. Consequently there is very
little unity in the policy of tha' govern
ment. It is a patchwork. Neither is
it continuous becnu-e these factious ale
very apt to kick over the traces fre
quently, and so to absorb another fac
tion and regain its maj >ri'y the gov
ernment must adopt all sorts of poi eies.
Such a policy is infinitely inferior
to having two pretty nearly balanced
parties. One party will be in power
Its rule is comparatively permanent and
confident.
There are always two ways of looking
at matters. S'lio-whete or other there
must lie a welding together of 1 lie peo
ple of 11 iisition In England anil on the
continent they do not, weid completely
In Aiu erica t.lie welding is done early
by the individual, and it resolves into
the two parties, Democratic and Repub
lican
1 112 we have parties, we must have a
m idline, an organization to eo leci
inonev, scene campaign speakers, and
so nn. And if we must have a machine
we must, have some people to run the
machine; some people to do the work
because this takes time.
Ilere is a parr, dep.iture, where the
legitimate passes over into the illegiti
mate. When we get a machine with
certain men in it their chief ambition is
the!■ uecess of the machine. That is
the horizon of their whole life—to make
t heir party victorious.
In order to make a machine suecess
fill we must have a great many people
working for it, and working enthus
iastically. If they work entinisiasti
oally for principles in which they are
interested, all right. But if they woik

for the rake-off—tfiat is, for mercenary
uiot.ves—we must find something to
give th'iu. There are varrnu.s things:
in the fiist place, jobs Thus it is the
interest, of the machine to increase the
number of offices under its control.
To run a campaign money is needed.
So it becomes convenient, to put up
men acceptable to railroad and other
corporations on condition that they will
give money to the campaign fund, or
nominate men who will themselves give
money. We have a steady stream of
the public money flowing into the party
treasury. Another effect upon the
public service is that it. causes less
work to be done than could be done,
because these offices would not be
taken unless they were a snap; and
1 here must, be a rel xation of discipline
because the occupant keeps on working
for the machine
What is the ati'dude we ought to
take? There is coming in a new vir
tue —civism—which means, save your
country from internal locs Patriotism
means from external foes. 'I bis virtue
of civism is being developed right and
left all over the country.
As regards the duty of the individ
ual kicker: It won't do to go oft by
yourselves if there are not. enough of
you; it will only cut you off from the
primary. Hut if there are enough of
you. go. You will have the old parties
h ibling for your support, and io spite
of themselves, they will have to pander
to better morals.

I'rof Iirun's tiilk was vry pleasant,

keeping your good int.n from yoing imo
politics, because your tongue, which is
a very unruly member, docs a great
deal of mischief. This is the reason
no one who values his reputation tries
to run for office.
I'rof. Brun related a 1 ex
perii tiee of his at a county convention
showing how the regular political
"machine" works. Speaking of this
branch ot the Anti-Spoils League, lie
said:
Those who have been in California a
few years, and who were here before
this institution was opened, pan testify
to the great, influence it, has had upon
this stain in an educational way. Now
cmn we not, extend our influence in a
new direction, and try to do a little in
the way of politicd reform also? In
tune I believe our organization ought
to do good, and our labors will not he
in vain.

Alter the anti-spuils symposium, a
fli'jrt busiuesa meeting was held lor the

purpose of completing the organization
of »he Stanford Good Government Club.
Prof Jjitlirop was temporary chairman
