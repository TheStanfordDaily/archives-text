## The 						First Inter-Fraternity Baseball Game at Stanford. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon the Si»ma Nus
and the Kijis will inaugurate iuter-frat
crnity baseball. The game will be
called on the new field at lour o'clock
The nines are fairly well matched, ex
cept. that the Sigma Nus are better
batters. The line-up of the two teams
allows that six of the Varsity nine will
play in the: game and that eight of the
eighteen players have been Varsity men;
so amusement, and friendly rivalry
should not be the ouly redeeming feat
ures of the contest.
The game was suggested and hur
riedly arranged late this afternoon.
TheFijishad intended to try cojclusious
wit h the f.iculty nine on the campus to
morrow afternoon; but the announcement,
that Dr. Jordan and Dr. Arii»c 11 of the
faculty team will be absent from the
University at that time caused this
hasty ar.angemeut.
