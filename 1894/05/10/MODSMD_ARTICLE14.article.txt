The sophomores decided yesterday
afernoon not to tender a reception to the
seniors. About a year ago last Septem
ber, on a very warm afternoon, the
members of the Class of' 94 were much in
demand in and about the chapel, and
served to aid the '96 freshmen both by
their needed strength and their friendly
and opportune ad vice at a time wheu
such things could be appreciated. It
would be but in a way repaying those
former kindnesses to tender to the seniors
a reception now when they are about to
leave the University for good.
