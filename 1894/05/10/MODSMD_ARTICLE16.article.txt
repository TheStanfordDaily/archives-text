The Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity is the wealthiest in the world.
When all its landed estates are culti
vated its endowment will amount to
about 8200,000,000.
Leland Stanford Jr. University is to
have a fully equipped marine biological
observatory. Such institutions are not
plentiful in the United States and have
ouly become comparatively numerous
in European countries in the past few
years. The popular name for such an
institution is a seaside laboratory and
this one will be known as the "Hopkins
Seaside Laboratory." The donor is
Timothy Hopkins, who has maintained
the temporary establishment at Pacific
Grove, and now intends to erect a larger,
more commodious building and to have
it equipped in such a manner that the
most thorough research can be prose
cuted within its walls.
