All voters connected with ih" Univer
sity may become active members of the
Good Government Club upon «i-zuiti>»
the constitution and the declaration of
the Anti-Spoils Lcnjrue; all members
of the University, whether voters or
not, may be admitted to issociato mem
bership upon si«jjriiriur the constitution.
In uocnrdatieu with these provisions
of the constitution of the Good Govern
ment Club, ii copy ot the constitution
and cards of the Anti-Spoils League
have been I »id ii|iori the counter in the
registrar's office for sign-it urea.
The Kxeeutive Committee asks for
the aet.ive support of every member ol
the University who le Is what every
generous heart ought to feel —the de
sire to eioer with honest, energy upon
the inevitable struggle with the cor
ruption now threatening all that is
worth maintaining in American ilisti
tutions. We ask you to enroll your
name, and to enmc out publicly on the
riiiht siile. If our country was attacked
by a foreign enemy every young man
in th o ! who couhl would
hasten to tike up arms ami t r o lightly
forth to danger or death, and tluite
who could not would envy their more
fortunate companions. Every young
woman would cut. lint and sew tlags
and bandages for the soldiers, to join
whom she would send her brother or
her lover with resolute constancy, even
if with a breaking heart
But we are threatened, some (if us
have been overcome, by a more cruel
and debasing tyranny than any foreign
power could exercise over us—the vil
lainous and irresponsible control of
ignorance and crime. From without
we might be beaten, wc could not be
conquered; from within we may be
weakened, ruined, ami destroyed. The
indifferent, like the corrupt, is a traitor;
the more a traitor in that he fins
usually against be tcr light. The
powers of darkness may say with truth,
lie that is not ayainst us is with us.

We call tl.en upon every voter in the
University to join with us iu active
membership, and upon every member
of the University to add bis or her
name to our roll; feeling confident that
if we have only courage and resolution
we shall achieve no small measure of
success.
It will be seen that one requisite of
admission to active membership is the
signature of the declaration of the
Anti-Spoils League. This declaration
is simply an expression of sentiment in
favor of the complete abolition of the
spoils system from the federal service.
There is no partisan object in this
declaration, nor any opposition to parti
sanship. It is intended to call forth a
wide expression of public sympathy
with civil service reform. No intelli
gent and high-minded man, not blinded
l>y prejudice, can fail to sympathize
with this movement. 'Jhe time for
deriding it has passed away. Politicians
may in practice repudiate it, hut they
are even now forced to express respect
for it. Now, public opinion directs in
such matters, and if an aroused and in
telligent public opinion can be made to
express in a vigorous way its detesta
tion of the present corrupt, cruel,
wasteful and inefficient method of mak
ing appointments to public offices it.
will permanently destroy the pernicious
and siliy principle, "to the victors be
long t he spoils "
It is believed that few who hope for
goo 1 government and who mean to
work for it Will withhold their names.
Some personal objection to Carl Sehurz,
the president of the league, lias been
encountered To the members of the
Executive Committee such an objection
seems to be not altogether reasonable
No man in a hurry fora doctor would
>t.op to see whether his horse is bay or
sorrel. We uige all who hold off on
personal grounds to consider seriously
whether this refusal results from an
honest scrup'e or merely exhibits an
i l-tempeivd and narrow prejudice
II they think they are doing lignt, we
have nothing to urge except that as
Miming their sympathy with the general
purposes of the association, we welcome
them to associate membership. We
have no desire to oppo-e conscientious
scruples, though we may not share
them.
The Executive Committee intends to
find valuable, and if possible interesting
work for every member who will do it.
