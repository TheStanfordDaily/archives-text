# Friday Evening's Entertainment.
## 
### 
The program of the Mandolin Club
concert published in yesterday's Palo
A I,to appeared incomplete form.
The corrected program is given below,
and a well filled house should greet
such an excellent entertainment. The
proceeds of the concert are to be de
voted to the lioblc and Gncina reading
room funds. Enciua boarders realize
now how indispensable a good supply
of newspapers and periodicals will ho
in the future, since the experiment
during the past year has been such a
marked success. A large attendance
at the concert will ensure a much bet
ter assoitment of magazines than we
have had during this year. Of the
program itself it is hardly necessary to
speak The fact that Messrs. Kennedy
and linker, the string quartet, and an
orchestra of fifteen pieces or more will
participate, is sufficient to guarantee a
plea-ant evening to all who may attend.
Mr. Voung and Mr. Copelaud will ap
pear before the University public lor
the first time.
Reserved seats are now on sale at
the postoffiee at fifty cents General
admissions (twenty five cents) can be
obtained from members of the Mandolin
Clu't.
