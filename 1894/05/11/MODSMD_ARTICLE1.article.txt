# Memorial Day Exercises.
## 
### 
The Memorial Day exercises will be
held Tuesdiy evening at 8 pm. in the
chapel, Papers will be read, and a
number of musical selections rendered,
ul! by students. It was supposed that,
of course, un excursion would be run
as on former years, but, owing to the
indifference of those placed in charge,
not enough students were enabled to
subscribe to the enterprise to insure its
success; the night, however, first, chosen
for the program will be retained, even
though the excursion is off. Monday
will, therefore, be free for private ex
cursions, or for any other plans, so fur
as program is concerned.
