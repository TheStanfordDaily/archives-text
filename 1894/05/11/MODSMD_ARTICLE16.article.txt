Wl3 would advise the Class of'9o
not to present a faice during the first
month of next semester for the benefit
Of their arinu il. There are three po
tent reasons which lead us to this eon
elusion: The farce, disregarding its ex
cellencies, would not draw the audience
which it would if it were presented
upon Junior Day. The freshmen of
next year, constituting our largest class
and from whom a good part of the aud
ience must be drawn, would know and
care nothing for the local hits. Fur
ther, the annual will cost about 82,000,
and the little that would be derived
from the fiirce would not go far toward
liquidating this debt. And finally it
would be better to wait and present a
good farce upou Junior Day and thu*
perpetuate the custom so auspiciously
inaugurated this year by the Class ol
'95.
