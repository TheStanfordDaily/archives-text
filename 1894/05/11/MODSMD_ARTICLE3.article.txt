will probably be compressed so as to
occupy no more space, but it is really
much longer than the last one. The
work is being printed on the campus.
Some idea may be had of the amount ol
labor represented in the compilation
when it is remembered that there is
scarcely a vacant room in the quad
rangle any hour in the morning, and
the different courses have to be de
posed of without conflict.
