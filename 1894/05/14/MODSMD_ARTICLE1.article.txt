# VARSITY, 11; ALAMEDA, 1.
## The
						Most Skillful Game of the Season. 
### 
The" best, baseball game played on
the..campus this season was the one
Saturday, in which Stanford defeated
the Alamcdas by a score of 11 to 1.
Comparatively few witnessed the game,
but those who were present were ap
preciative of the many good poiuts ol
p |a y •
In the first inning Sheehan made a
hit, stole his way round to third, and
came home on Lewis's long fly to K«*lly
In the next inning Calhoun made the
circuit on errors by the visitors. Dive)
and Dyer made hits in the third, and j
White scored them both with a right
field single. Davey and Dyer were
again on bases in the fifth, and were
brought in by Bumiller's bit. over the |
infield. The Alauiedas went to pieces j
in the eighth inning, and five runs
came over the rubber, Stautbrd did ,
not score in the ninth inning.
The Alamedas scored their only run
in the second, when Simpson drew a
base on balls, and was sent round by !
singles of Crowley and Kelly
Weldon pitched a skillful game for
the home teiin, relying entirely upon i
his support. The old fault of senseless j
base-running was much less appare t.
than usual. Nearly all the players j
were alert for every chance, both in j
fielding atid in base-running. Humillet j
and White each saved Lewis an error
by yood catches. The work of the out
field was perfection.
Molloy's pitching was effective for
all save Dver who found hiui for four!
hits, but Bumiller, Lewis, nd White
obtained their hits with men ou bases j
Arlett and "Champion Jim's" brother j
threw splend dly but were rather wea*
on ground balls.
The score:
Stanford Varsity.
