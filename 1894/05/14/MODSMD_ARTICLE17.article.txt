# The 						Mandolin Club Concert.
## 
### 
The concert given Friday night by
the Mandolin (Jlub for the benefit of
the lloble and Kncina reading rooms was
very well attended The nio.-t, con
spicuous tiling about the audience after
its mzc and enthusiasm was the coui
paiatively small number of ladies pres
eut.
The Mandolin Club began with an
arrangement of the airs fum Audran's
opera ''La Cigale," the libretto of which
is founded upon La Foiimin's well
known fable. The arrangement in
eluded that charming little song f'oui
the laud of Miteio, "One Day, Margot,"
which is a miracle of rustic grace
There was also a melodious waltz move
ment which L'-cocq might huve written.
The audience is indebted to the
members of the string quirtet for the
opportunity of hearing a composition by
Paderewski.
Without being reminiscent Pader
ewski's Minuet has the same spirit of
plaintive tenderness common to almost
all of Chopin's music. The charm oil

the composition although in u large de i
gree an intellectual one, is, above all, |
sensuous and appealing. Mr. Carl
I liotnas played the cadenza especially
very sati-d' ctorily.
From Wal lings to Warner is a long
flight, but Mr. Kaufman accomplished
it to the evident satisfaction of the
audience.
Mr. Sam. Pl itt played Chopin's Polo- i
naisfc,()pus 40, No. 1, with much con-,
tidence. In response to a warm encore |
he gave a composition of his own, "En- j
cina Waltz."
Mr. M. II. Kennedy sang a number
by liohm, and Messrs Young and
Copehind and the orchestral associa
tion completed the program
The accompaniments of Mr Henry 1
Harris were all that could be desired.
It may be pertinent to suggest that
the Mandolin Club strive to make their
elections more varied in thÂ« foture.
While their renditions were commend
able, the repetion of the andante and
the waltz movement became somewhat
tedious.
