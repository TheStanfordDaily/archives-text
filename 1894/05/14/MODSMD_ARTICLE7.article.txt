Mr. David Heap of Sau Jose deliv
ered »n address in the chapel yesterday
morning on ' Children of Charity."
The following is an abstract of it:
The story is told of a colored preacher
who didn't show any very exceptional
ability in that direction, but who
claimed to have seen in heaven the let
ters G. P C. which he interpreted to
his congregation to mean "go preach
Christ." Whereupon one of his con
gregation arose and said he had no
doubt but that the learned geutlemau
had seen the vision, but there might
be some doubt as to the interpretation.
•'I believe," he said, "that it meant 'go
pick cotton '" 1, even L. have had
that same vision, but, those letters have
been translated for me by a golden pen
into our watchwords for today: "Go
protect children."
Broadly speaking, there are three
classes of children lor which I hold the
sta'e responsible: the dependent, the
defective, and the delinquent.
It is no easy matter to determine the
dividing line between "no good" and
"witrth saving," but there are de
linquent boys and yirls whom nobody
wishes cast upon them For these
ihere is no better school than that of
Whittier, and other state institutions of
like character
It is difficult to tell just what boys
and girls are lit. subjects for reform
schools. Kauh case must be carefully
considered upon its own merits. There
is the very had, vicious hoy whom you
should take out of the slums into the
open air; wash out his foul mouth, let
hiin woi k at something useful, point
him heavenward. It is not probable
ihat he will turn out a good citizen
after all, hut what of that? You have
done your duty. Hut you have no
risiht to lose si>iht of that boy until he
is buried or cremated.
The progress of the race is involved
in your action. The eyes of God and
maiikitid are upon you.
Itoftej happens that the mentally
defective children are dangerous.
These -ire confined in homes for insane
children. 11 •»w many a mother has
worn her tinkers to the bone that her
idiot child miuht liave thir cheer for
the body which is denied him for the
mind
I am much more interested in those
children who have become dependent
through no fault of their «wn First of
all comes death Every one feels a
strong in pat by lor these orphans even
if he does not. snow it. There are poor
children whose fathers and motheis are
still living, but who arc curses rather
than what parents should ■' e to them.
We fail to realize all when we say ''His
father drinks."
$275,000 have been appropiiated al
ready for orphan homes and like insti
tutions for children in this state alone
But children are being run by clock
work. "Righteousness" should he our
watchword. I object to catholic and
other faiths supporting their religion
at my expense. People arc actually
being compelled to pay tor the importa
tion of doctrines to which they are op
posed. I mean to say there is too
large a percentage of Catholic and sec
tarian institutions for children iu this
land.
