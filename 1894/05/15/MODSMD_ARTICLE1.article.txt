The? lasol all team leaves for San j
Francisco on the noon train to try con !
elusions with the invincible St. Mary's
College team at the Midwinter l air |
grounds, A strong • lFort was made to
have the game take place on the [
campus, hut the St. Mary's flatly re
fused, giving as an excuse that our col
lege pap< r did not give them a square
deal in the wnteup of the game played
here over two year as;o. The St. Mary's
team must win two games from Stanford
before it c;hi claim the championship
cup, while Stanford's winning one game
from her will decide the champion
ship. Our team is in hardly the best
trim, and should have at least two weeks j
more of Hard practice before g"ing up j
against such formidable opponents
The Stanford team will be made up in
the following in inner: Mcl.aine, p;
I)avey, c; Calhoun, Ist; Bumiller, 2d;
Dyer, 3d; l.ewis, s s, Harrelsou, If; |
fcheehun, c 112; Downing, r 112.
The northwest baseball trip may not
betaken by the Varsity owing to the I
refusal of the Multnoin h Athletic!
Club to play a game at Portland. The
Multnouiahs liiaintaiu that it is an in-j
jury to the best interests ot athletics |
to carry on contests between college
and athletic club teams, Icr they were
overwhelmingly defeated by the Stan- j
joid football team last. New Year's day.
The Seattle and Tacoimi athletic clubs!
have not yet offered liberal eiioiigli !
guarantees to insure tho expenses ot !
the trip.
The whole baseball outlook is rather J
uncertain. In more respects ilian one j
a good deal depends upon the lesult '
of the game with the St.. Mary's nine at
the Fair tomorrow.
M. Mary's College, like all su di j
Catholic ins'illllions, makes baseball its 1
principal athletic pastime. It is re- j
ported that the school has as many as;
four nines always in active pincnce i

lit tie delay will lie caused, and the team
will not get started as early as it, ex
pected to on its northern trip
The northern prospects are not so
auspicious as l.liey might, be. In older
to til ike connection with the Honolulu
Steamer that leaves Sin Francisco on
the 31st, a Saturday must he utilized
in travel from the north to San Fran-
Cisco, and Saturday is always a good
baseball dav. The management, is
awaiting further information from the
citie- in the northwest before making
a definite decision.
One nip or the other will surely be
taken. If the northern trip is thought
impracticable a game will l>c played
with one of the teams of the Central Cali
fornia League during Commencement
week while the 'earn is waiting lor the
departure of the steamer lor the islands.
The game will be played either at
Santa Rosa or at Petaluma.
Ihe Central California League is

composed of the following semi-profes
sional teams: San J rancisco, Petaluma,
Vullejo, an<l Santa lto.sa.
