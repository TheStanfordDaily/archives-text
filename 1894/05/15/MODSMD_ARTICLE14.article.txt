The reasons uoied in another column
and which have been given by some
northern athletic teams as their excuse
for refusing to meet our baseball team
are very novel, and must be gratifying
to our own men. To have an athletic
team of recognized merit refuse to meet
us because we are stronger than they,
and will be sure to beat tlietn, is some
thing in the nature of an unintended
compliment. This uiav deprive the
team of a tour that, 'hey have looked
forward to and which they have earned;
it is to be hoped no hitch will occur in
the arrangements for the Hawaiian trip.
