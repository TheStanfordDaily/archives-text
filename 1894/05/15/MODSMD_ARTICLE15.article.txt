Members of various organ<zar.ions
have been remarking mi I lie repeated
duns they have received lor representa
tion in the annual. There is evidently
some mistake which the manager should
ni;ike it his duty to correct. Several
fraternities have also complained ol
beiug charged a second time lor the
appearance in the annual ol' plates and
cuts which the management have been
unable to provide. This brings up, also
lor the manager's eonsideiution, the ad
visability ol refunding the amount first
charged, before second hills are pre
sented for the same unattainable pur
pose.
