A practical joker who is not afraid
of consequences has the element of man
hood in him, but one who plays his tricks
iu the stillness of uight and covers his re
treat with duplicity, and allows his
neighbors to pay the damage and suffer
all the iticonveuience, is a peso and one
that needs stamping out without mercy.
Some few days ago the organ iu the
chapel was seriously injured by having
books piled inside of it, and conse
quently had to be repaired at the Uni
versity expense, which was considerable
in proportion to the amount of fun it
must have occasioned the jokers
Every week some childish thing
is done; such trifles as hiding the city
messenger's box or the Daily Palo
Alto box seem to afford especial
amusement.
It has been suggested that if the Uni
versity property continues to be dam
aged, the best way to stop the nuisance
effectually is to call upon the students to

make an assessment upon themselves in
order to pay for all repairs. This seems
just, for if we are apathetic enough to
tolerate these depredations we cannot
complain at being asked to pay. The
best way to stop them, however, is for
eaclt student, to make a point of report
ing to headquarters any vandal immed
iately he is known. A man who can
damage the property and buildings at
Stanford is certainly one for whom there
is no mercy.
