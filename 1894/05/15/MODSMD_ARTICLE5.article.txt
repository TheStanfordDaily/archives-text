Valuable Work by Seniors in Engineering.
For the whole semester A. N. Cudde
bick, '1)4, and It M. Drake, '94, have
been engaged preparing an extensive
report on a sewerage system for Palo
Alto. It comprises a nun of the whole
of the Palo Alto tract down to the bay,
with grades and elevations, and all the
details necessary for sewerage on the
â€¢'separate system," or lor one that does
not provide tor storm waters, 't he re
port is voluminous, and represents a
large amount of work. The same stu
dents have also made a report to the
Palo Alto Council on a water supply
system for the township. It is satis
f ctory to know that, work of practical
importance and of decided economic
value is being done at the University,
since it indicates that some departments
at least are in touch with outside things
.ind outside needs.
