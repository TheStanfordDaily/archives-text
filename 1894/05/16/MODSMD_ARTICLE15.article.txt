Editor Daily Alto Palo: —
We have thirty pages of pay ads. at
$20 per patre, but of course a certain
per cent, of these cannot be collected, as
is the case with all such publications. We
have received from the class $225. Due
us from fraternities and organizations
S2-10, of which Sl€s4: has been paid.
The edition is 850 copies, of which 550
are sold by subscription and about 75,
going to advertisers and to those con
nected with the annual, are deadheads.
The cost of the publication, including
working expenses, will be about $2,201).
So certain am I that nothing will be
made on the publication that L will give
the class my profits if they will pay
one-half of my personal expenses in
curred in getting the publication out.
N. G. Huxton, lius. Mgr.

[The above letter, together with three
times as much additional matter which
space forbids our inserting, comes from
one whose office is not a sinecure
nor does the small amount of honor
that is attached to the position offset
the drudgery and annoyance connected
with the work. If any one has drawn
the erroneous inference from anything
that has appeared in these columns that
unfairness was imputed to the manage
ment of tlic '95 annual, we wish to re
move that impression. The article
that appeared in yesterday evening's
issue set up no claim to exactness; in
fact it was pretty liberally supp.ied
with ''abouts." In substance what
could not be published amounts to this:
The Hoard of Kditors set the price for
each fraternity's spaoe at Sis; the first
bills were for engravings aione, the
second for the balance of the whole
amount and express charges. No bill
was ever repeated. Any fraternity
which is not represented by what it was
charged for will have the amount re
funded. Mr. Buxton's accounts are
open for inspection, —Editor]
