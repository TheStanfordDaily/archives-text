As we recall the time when it was
necessary to stand in line for half an
hour to secure one's mail, we cannot*
but appreciate the conveniences of our
present postal service. l>ut there is
one fault which causes a great deal of
inconvenience, and which could be;
easily remedied. The Sunday delivery
is not satisfactory. The afternoon de
livery now comes at a time when most
people are at dinner, while the hall |
hour in the morning is eutirely too'
short. It is not to be expected that the i
general delivery window will be kept !
open on Sunday as on other davs, bur j
we would suggest that access be I
allowed to the lock boxes at all hours,
as is the custom in every well-conducted j
office.
