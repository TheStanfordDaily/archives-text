# Petition For a Meeting of the Student Body.
## 
### 
7 liave been presented with the fol
lowing petition, signed by nineteen stu
dents:
'â€¢We, the undersigned students in
Leland Stanford Jr University, re
spectl'ully petition the President to
| call a meeting of the Associated Stu
dents for Friday, May 18th, to consider
I the question of starting a literary maga
zine at this University under the a us
| pices of the student body, and to
[ transact such other business as may be
presented."
I required that the meeting be
called by petition because I have
j doubts as to the probability of securing
a quorum otherwise. It is essential
that the meeting he well attended, not
only by those in favor of a third college
journal, but also by those opposed to it,
for it is a matter of grave concern to all.
The treasurer will please he prepared to
make his annual report.
E. It. Zion, Pres.
