### 
The members of the Class of '04 are
now alumni of the University. They
composed the third class to be gradu

classes that have been euabled to com
plete the course in less than four years
because of advanced credit received for
work done at other universities.
Upon thirty-five men and twelve
women was conferred the bachelor's
degree, besides the degree of A. B,
there were conferred twelve A. M .'s,
eleven to meu and one to a woman; one
degree of engineer; and one of Ph. D.,
the highest degree given by the Uni
versity and the first one it has granted.
Knciua gymnasium was the scene of
the graduating exercises, held at ten
o'clock this morning, and was pro
fusely decorated with evergreens. The
low platform on which the speakers and
several members of the faculty sat was
embowered in date and fan palms and
draped above with United States flags.
In the foreground over the stage was a
centrepiece of plaited palm leaves form
ing the numeral 94, resting on a cardi
nal background.
About six hundred persons, including
the graduates, who occupied the front
rows, were seated in the body of the
house.
An opening prayer was offered and
the benediction pronounced by Kev.
