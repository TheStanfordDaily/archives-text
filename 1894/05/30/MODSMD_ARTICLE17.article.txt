The Board of Control, in wliat it
deemed au equitable arrangement to
rectify a discrepancy in last semester's
term of publication, ruled that this
semester the paper should not cease
publication with the advent of the labor
ious final week (as had always been the
ease before) unless a Commencement
edition were issued instead. Final ex
aminations mean as muoh to those who
work on the paper and to the student
printers as they do to other students; to
we accepted this alternative.
