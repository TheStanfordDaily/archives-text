# Reception to Seniors at Xazmin House.
## 
### 
From two o'clock until six on Satur
day afternoon the parlors of Xuzmin
House, the president's residence, were
crowded by the graduating class and
the others whom Dr. and Mrs. Jordan
had invited for the occasion. About

two hundred and twenty-five were pres
ent, almost everyone without exception
having accepted this invitation. Re
freshments were served in the tastefully
decorated parlors. The attraction of the
afternoon was found in several Japanese
girls whom Dr. Jordan had engaged
from the city and who furnished very
enjoyable music. Contrary to expec
tations, after the affair was over, ex
pressions of pleasure and delight over
the afternoon's entertainment were
heard on every side. It has almost be
come a habit here to look upon re
ceptions as somewhat in the nature of a
bore and when any one of them is pro
nounced to be a decided success by
every one present it means that thought
ful preparations have beeu made to
render it so.
