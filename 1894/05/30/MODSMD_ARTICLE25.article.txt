# The 						Senior Farce.
## 
### 
The first theatrical performance to be
undertaken by a graduating class at
Stanford was the farce written by Miss
Eugenia Mabury, '94, and presented on
Monday afternoon, May 28. As with
the junior farce, Kncina gymnasium
was converted into a temporary theatre.
Admission was free to all, and intimate
friends of the class received reserved
seat tickets.
Among the audience, which num
bered seven hundred, were many guests
from neighboring cities. A decided im
provement over the junior farce was ef
fected in the darkened room, and in the
scenery, which was produced by
Miss Ames, '94, and Prof. Brown.
To these two and to Thaxter, '94. are due
much credit for the stage settings
During the interludes selections were
played by Schubert's Orchestra. "Are
you a member of the Co op ?" asked in
a well-assumed effeminate voice, began
the local touches. "You will find my
wheel down by Mice's" ; "Who, Archie
Nice's?" was another in the same scene.
In the second scene Dr. Jordan's evas
ion of a remark was recalled by the re
ply "Oh, 1 only meant it in a Pickwick
ian sense." Allusion to Field's »SV
quuio verse was made in the question
What does 'Carolus Agcr' mean?" the
answer to which was "Some species of
'nerve tonic' i suppose.". The extreme
youthfulness of the class president was
referred to in the assertion that he was
admitted to the Fair on Chronicle Day
without question.
The caste consisted of Sox as Fred
Smith, a sophomore; Young as Hal Cut
ler, a freshman: Wilson as Jim Smith,
a junior (a cousin of Prof. Mas ton);
Cuddeback as postmaster; Miss Hols
claw as Flora Crosby, a freshman; Miss
Nichols as Mrs. Maston; Trumbo as
Prof. Maston Miss Mabury as
Grace Oreenway, a sophomore; and
Miss Eaves and Miss 1)» Laguna, and
Crane, Fife, and others in the minor
parts of guests at tho lioble reception.
To Wilson, Young, and Miss Mabury
arc due tne most credit for their acting.
The plot of the farce is centred in an
attempt to avoid taking one of Prof.
Maston's exes., for through the post
master's mistake Fred Smith opens the
telegram intended for Jim Smith, the
professor's cousin. The message con
tains directions to take charge of the
ex. in the professor's agsence. For
two whole days Smith is keptaway from
his room in Kncina where the telegram
has been left by his name-sake. The
complications that result, from the
schemes to engage his attention and
avoid the ex. form the life of the plot.
Jim Smith finds himself so beset with
unusual attentions that he believes that
at the end of his junior year he is be
ing rushed by a fraternity and readily
accepts what be mistakes for an offer to
join. At one of those ideal dry affairs,
a Koble reception, Prof. Maston finally
reaches his cousin, Smith, in spite of
the others' ruses to keep him and Mrs.
Maston otherwise engaged. The schem
ers are thunderstruck at the uselessness
of all their efforts when they learn that
the ex. was not intended for them at all
but for another class. The climatic
closing word "Sold" gave the name to
the farceand elicited a responsive feeling
from tho audience as the curtaiu was
drawn upon the final sceue.
