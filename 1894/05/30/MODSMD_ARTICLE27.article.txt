# THE
						COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS.
## "The Education of a Naturalist"; by Prof. John C. Branner. 
### 
In the early days of science when
there was a good deal of unclaimed and
uncultivated ground lying about, men
sometimes dropped into science by the
merest chance,some of them with but little
preparation for the work, and many of
them with less. Nowadays we have chang
ed all that. And ye[, as mightbe expected,
there are still plenty of persons of intel
ligence who have no conception what
ever of the duties of a scientific man;
those who imagine that science as a
profession can be picked up just as the
duties of certain civil offices, or of cleri
cal positions, may be readily learned
and performed by any man of ordinary
intelligence. Among the applications I
have received fjr employment upon
geological surveys uuder my direction,
one man gave as a reason why he should
be employed that he was a graduate of
West Point; another was interested in
geology and had read many books upon
the subject, among which he cited some
of the vaporiugs of Ignatius Donuelly;
another used to be acquainted with
Professor Winchell; and another was
in poor health and thought field-work
would be good for him; and still another
was a consistent member of the Presby
terian church. At least half of the ap
plicants have asked for employment be
cause they understood ordinary land
surveying; and one of them admitted
that he had no other qualification than
that he was "a good hand to camp out."
Hut, this dropping into science of such
men is no longer possible, and we now
realize that those who are to do the
scientific work of today and of the fu
ture must be thoroughly grounded in
their college training, or its equivalent,
and they must bring to their woik the
best and broadest scholarship and the
most thorough special training.
Of certain subjects that the natural
ist must study it is not uecessary to
make mention; for he who expects to be
a botanist will, of course, study the bio
logical branches that arc essential to a
thorough comprehension of botany.
Those things, however, will always take
care of themselves. The more difficult
questions that arise in the minds of stu
dents relate chiefly to studies and other
matters that lie without his special line
of work.
The general training of a scientific
man during the first three years of his
college course is not, or should not be,
essentially different from that of any
man of culture.
In the balancing of the essen
tials and the non-essentials, certain eco
nomic considerations have, almost with
out exception, to be faced at the very
outset. Those of us who devote our
selves to pure science are constantly be
ing wearied with that most tiresome of
all Philistine questions about the prac
tical value of what a man reads about,
thinks about, or does; how this and that
study, this and that bit of training, are
going to be of any use—the whole in
tellectual and cultural bearing of an
education being completely ignored.
As men who love science for its own
sake, we get weary of such questions,
and some of us feel driven, in ordt-r to
emphasiz« our warnings, to avoid the
useful altogether. Thus we occasion
ally have, on the one hand, men who
have a horror of doing anything of prac
tical value; and on the other, men who
have no patience with an investigation
which does not promise some material re
ward. My opinion is that there is little to
choose between in these two types.
One of them is just as far wrong as the
other. Pure science has its place and
its work; so has applied science; and
each iri its place is important and indis
pensable.
Whether one devotes himself to pure
or applied science should be decided by
one's taste and fitness as far as possible.
Of one thing, however, be assured:
without pure science there can be no
applied science; and if anyone hopes to

become eminent in either branch he
must first lay hold on science itself.
The great advancement, the physical
comforts and conveniences—what is gen
erally comprehended under the word
progress—of today, has not sprung full
grown from the braiu of applied science,
as so many people seem to think.
Such progress has been made possible
only by the abstruse and apparently aim
less and useless generalizations of pure
science.
Speaking of men who devote them
selves to such work, Mr. Holly says:
"These men do uot indeed create the
laws of Nature, as they sometimes al
most seeui to, but they go up into the
trembling mountain and the thick dark
ness and bring down the tables upon
which they are written."
lJut whatever we study and whatever
we do in science, there is to be done in
it an immense amount of what engi
neers know as "dead work," that is, work
that is quite indispensable, work that
doesn't show to advantage so far as
mere display is concerned, but without
which the whole superstructure would
be liable to go to pieces.
AH scientific education and all scien
tific work is based, or should be based,
on a sigle dogma—the oDly dogma that
science recognizes—and that is, that
truth is better than falsehood.
In its professional bearing the mojpt
essential part of the training of a man
of science should be to the end that, he
observe well, and that in his deductions
he properly subordinate his facts. His
preliminary techuical traiuing should
therefore be for the purpose of teaching
him accuracy and detail; and the ne
ctssity of accuracy should be so deeply
impressed upon his mind that accuracy
will become a part of his nature.
As the whole professional training of
the naturalist is for the purpose of en
abling him to reach correct conclusions,'
he should be trained in the use of every
method of investigation that will aid
him, and among these methods I count
as of great importance that of multiple
working hypotheses. In my own exper
ience I have found it of the greatest
value, and I know of no better way of
developing the reasoning powers, or of
anticipating difficulties, or of reaching
right conclusion?, than by the proper
use of hypotheses. I lay some stress
upon this point because I fiud that
there are those who think that a man
of science can have nothing to do with
hypotheses, that he must confine him
self to facts. Theory is just as impor
tant in science as fact, though perform
ing very diffeicnt functions.
There are certain things the young
naturalist must learn, and it is well for
him and for the world if he learn them
just as early in his career as possible.
To some of these I would call his atten
tion.
In his methods he must always
be willing to profit by the experiences
of others. Methods and appliances of
research are constantly being improved,
but the improvements are made, not by
disregarding the experience of others,
but by making every possible use of it.
The newly fledged sometimes begin
with the idea that the world was not
discovered until they discovered it, and
they think it perfectly safe to discard
all human experience. This is one of
the signs of a moral disease vulgarly
known as the "big-head." When a
scientific man gets it he never recovers
in time to be of any service to mankind.
I would not have a young man doubt
his own ability; confidence in one's
self, if it be well placed, is an important
element in success, but it doesn't fol
low that when one trusts himself he
should mistrust all the rest of the
world. We hope and believe that the
young man of today is wiser and better
equipped than the young man of any
past generation; but the difference is,
after all, not great, and it is quite Bife
to presume that one's ancestors did
know a few things worth knowing.
The necessity of caution on the part
of the young man in science in publish
ing conclusions that one feels to be open

to criticism, or when he sees that im
portant facts may have been overlooked,
cannot be too strongly emphasized
The publication of facts is generally
useful, but deductions can afford to wait
until they are properly matured. A
most valuable piece of advice once given
me was to the effect that young people
would better not begin pumping out of
their intellectual resorvoirs before some
thing has been pumped into them.
Life is too short, and progress is too
slow, tor us to cumber the march of
scieuce with verbose discussions which
help toward strife and contention in
stead of toward truth and union. "The
longer anyone studies a vast subject, the
more cautious in inference does he be
come." To be sure "ignorance is no
reason with a fool for holding his
tongue"; but my advice is not intended
for fools, who will be fools in spite of
everybody and everything,but for those
who, having sound sense, desire not to
bring discredit upon themselves or upon
the science to which they are devoted.
Scieuce is not infrequently charged
with vacillation. Approps of this some
one remarks: "Scieuce says—but no
matter what science says, for the next
tiaie she says anything she'll say just
the opposite," We cannot deny the
justness of the implied criticism; but
that it is just must beattributed entirely
to premature utterances. We have some
sad examples of scientific men whose
premature conclusions, drawn from too
hasty or incomplete work, have kept
half a dozen good men busy for years in
correcting their mistakes and in putting
the truth before the world. They are
usually men of good enough intentions,
but "we have a right to expect some
thing more than good intentions of
men." All people mean well; it is our
business to do well.
Sensationalism is another thing that
has done, and will probably continue to
do, great injury to all branches of
science. There are certain features
about every science that impress the
uninformed with their novelty, and
there are certain persons who are al
ways ready to make capital out of them.
This gives rise to a sort of "O my!"
class of men and to an "O my!" kind of
science. Such people delight in the
startling; none of the more radical
theories of science, theories put forth by
the right thinking with great caution,
stagger them. In the scientific man's
training the less we have of the sensa
tional the better it will be for science
and for the man.
Those who are at once workers in
science and teachers of science know
how difficult it sometimes is to draw a
sharp line between what we know and
what we simply believe; but so far as
possible this distinction should always
be kept before the minds of students,
and no effort should be spared to pre
vent that dazing of their minds which
prevents them from weighing evidence
and from distinguishing between simple
truth, legitimate hypotheses, and simple
figments of the imagination.
And now just a word about our re
sponsibilities to our own intellects.
Intellect is the tool with which the
man of science has to do his work. If
that tool is bent out of shape or dulled
by improper use, it cannot perform its
functions properly. It is highly es
sential therefore that lie keep his intel
lect unimpaired. He should strive to
keep his mind free from those tricks of
logic, rhetoric, and sentiment by which
so many of us allow ourselves to be im
posed upon. We are bound by every
sentiment of honesty to go whore our
evidence leads us, whether it takes us
to a pleasant place or not. Truth must
be our companion whether she be an
agreeable or a disagreeable one —
a handsome or an ugly one. We can
not honestly say to reason, "Thus far
shalt thou go, but no farther"; we
can't reasonably follow science to a
certain point and then abandon it for
the divining rod or spiritualistic seances
or clap-trap appliances of any kind.
The man who has no notion of accept
ing the results of his reasoning would

jlist as well not reason at all; while he
who undertakes to reason within certain
limits insults his intelligence.
Above all, let me caution young
naturalists against what I may call the
"debating society" style of reasoning.
The debating society is calculated to
increase one's intellectual agility, no
doubt, but as its object is the training
of advocates, its influence on a man of
scieuce is harmful to the last degree,
fora scientific man must be a judge —
uot an advocate.
I take it that it is hardly necessary
to speak here of the necessity of one's
interesting himself in a specialty if he
wishes to accomplish much in the way
of original work nowadays. In sayiug
a word for specialties I am fully aware
of all that has been urged against this
kind of scholarship. The president of
one of our greatest educational institu
tions said to me a few years ago that he
had his doubts and fears about the out
come of this modern tendency among
scientific, men to specialization. Said
lie: "If this thing goes on, we shall
have after a while a man who will know
all about the stripes on a trilobite's tail,
but he won't know anything else." It
is very easy to ridicule a specialist, if
the aims of his studies are not compre
hended. Gaivani studying the twitch
ing of a frog's legs, Darwin breeding
pigeons, and Agassiz plauting sticks on
a glacier, are inspiring or ridiculous in
proportion as we comprehend the bear
ing or end of their studies. Whether
studying the twitching of a frog's legs
or the stripes on a trilobite's tail is an
unworthy and contemptible occupation
for an intelligent man depends, there
fore, upon the motive and the ultimate
objects of the study. And in regard
to special work by those who aspire to
broad culture in science, I can only say
that a man who is incapable of doing
and has not done special investigation
is not capable of taking a broad view of
science in any of its relations. Mr.
Darwin has done some of the best gen
eralizing of our age, but before he did it
he had done some of the best of special
izing, and that too on such unpractical,
uninteresting, and useless animals as
the barnacles.
The necessity of specialties has
sprung from the necessity of a division
of labor in science, just as manual skill
comes from a division of labor in the
arts. Progress depends on such
division.
But while we must confine ourselves
to specialties, care should be taken not
unnecessarily to diminish the field of
our observations. There is a tendency
on the part of a certain class of special
ists to put everything under the micro
scope. This is an excellent way of
seeing some things; but it is as difficult
to examine a landscape with a micro
scope as it is to examine bacteria with
out one. Many questions in scicnce
can be studied satisfactorily only when
we take a broad view of them, and some
discretion must be used in the applica
tion of methods.
Inquiries are often addressed to col
lege professors as to what a student
should take up as a specialty. This is
a matter about which one who is not
flippant is slow to give advice. There
are some general truths, however, that
arc applicable to all cases:
First. You should not mistake your
ambition for your natural calling. It
doesn't follow because you would like
to be a Darwin that you are cut out for
one.
Second. You must not imagine be
cause you love nature that you were
born fora naturalist. This kind of
a mistake is often made by young
people.
It is not to be supposed that the man
who studies plants is necessarily in love
with plants, or that the entomologist is
necessarily in love with insects.
The lover of nature is a poet whose
fancy endows nature'? bare facts with
attributes that the naturalist, as such,
knows nothing about. One sometimes
hears it said that Wordsworth and
Lowell would have made good natural
