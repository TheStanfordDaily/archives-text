# THE 						COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS.
## "The Education of a Naturalist"; by Prof. John C. Branner. 
### 
In the early days of science when
there was a good deal of unclaimed and
uncultivated ground lying about, men
sometimes dropped into science by the
merest chance,some of them with but little
preparation for the work, and many of
them with less. Nowadays we have chang
ed all that. And ye[, as mightbe expected,
there are still plenty of persons of intel
ligence who have no conception what
ever of the duties of a scientific man;
those who imagine that science as a
profession can be picked up just as the
duties of certain civil offices, or of cleri
cal positions, may be readily learned
and performed by any man of ordinary
intelligence. Among the applications I
have received fjr employment upon
geological surveys uuder my direction,
one man gave as a reason why he should
be employed that he was a graduate of
West Point; another was interested in
geology and had read many books upon
the subject, among which he cited some
of the vaporiugs of Ignatius Donuelly;
another used to be acquainted with
Professor Winchell; and another was
in poor health and thought field-work
would be good for him; and still another
was a consistent member of the Presby
terian church. At least half of the ap
plicants have asked for employment be
cause they understood ordinary land
surveying; and one of them admitted
that he had no other qualification than
that he was "a good hand to camp out."
Hut, this dropping into science of such
men is no longer possible, and we now
realize that those who are to do the
scientific work of today and of the fu
ture must be thoroughly grounded in
their college training, or its equivalent,
and they must bring to their woik the
best and broadest scholarship and the
most thorough special training.
Of certain subjects that the natural
ist must study it is not uecessary to
make mention; for he who expects to be
a botanist will, of course, study the bio
logical branches that arc essential to a
thorough comprehension of botany.
Those things, however, will always take
care of themselves. The more difficult
questions that arise in the minds of stu
dents relate chiefly to studies and other
matters that lie without his special line
of work.
The general training of a scientific
man during the first three years of his
college course is not, or should not be,
essentially different from that of any
man of culture.
In the balancing of the essen
tials and the non-essentials, certain eco
nomic considerations have, almost with
out exception, to be faced at the very
outset. Those of us who devote our
selves to pure science are constantly be
ing wearied with that most tiresome of
all Philistine questions about the prac
tical value of what a man reads about,
thinks about, or does; how this and that
study, this and that bit of training, are
going to be of any use—the whole in
tellectual and cultural bearing of an
education being completely ignored.
As men who love science for its own
sake, we get weary of such questions,
and some of us feel driven, in ordt-r to
emphasiz« our warnings, to avoid the
useful altogether. Thus we occasion
ally have, on the one hand, men who
have a horror of doing anything of prac
tical value; and on the other, men who
have no patience with an investigation
which does not promise some material re
ward. My opinion is that there is little to
choose between in these two types.
One of them is just as far wrong as the
other. Pure science has its place and
its work; so has applied science; and
each iri its place is important and indis
pensable.
Whether one devotes himself to pure
or applied science should be decided by
one's taste and fitness as far as possible.
Of one thing, however, be assured:
without pure science there can be no
applied science; and if anyone hopes to

become eminent in either branch he
must first lay hold on science itself.
The great advancement, the physical
comforts and conveniences—what is gen
erally comprehended under the word
progress—of today, has not sprung full
grown from the braiu of applied science,
as so many people seem to think.
Such progress has been made possible
only by the abstruse and apparently aim
less and useless generalizations of pure
science.
Speaking of men who devote them
selves to such work, Mr. Holly says:
"These men do uot indeed create the
laws of Nature, as they sometimes al
most seeui to, but they go up into the
trembling mountain and the thick dark
ness and bring down the tables upon
which they are written."
lJut whatever we study and whatever
we do in science, there is to be done in
it an immense amount of what engi
neers know as "dead work," that is, work
that is quite indispensable, work that
doesn't show to advantage so far as
mere display is concerned, but without
which the whole superstructure would
be liable to go to pieces.
AH scientific education and all scien
tific work is based, or should be based,
on a sigle dogma—the oDly dogma that
science recognizes—and that is, that
truth is better than falsehood.
In its professional bearing the mojpt
essential part of the training of a man
of science should be to the end that, he
observe well, and that in his deductions
he properly subordinate his facts. His
preliminary techuical traiuing should
therefore be for the purpose of teaching
him accuracy and detail; and the ne
ctssity of accuracy should be so deeply
impressed upon his mind that accuracy
will become a part of his nature.
As the whole professional training of
the naturalist is for the purpose of en
abling him to reach correct conclusions,'
he should be trained in the use of every
method of investigation that will aid
him, and among these methods I count
as of great importance that of multiple
working hypotheses. In my own exper
ience I have found it of the greatest
value, and I know of no better way of
developing the reasoning powers, or of
anticipating difficulties, or of reaching
right conclusion?, than by the proper
use of hypotheses. I lay some stress
upon this point because I fiud that
there are those who think that a man
of science can have nothing to do with
hypotheses, that he must confine him
self to facts. Theory is just as impor
tant in science as fact, though perform
ing very diffeicnt functions.
There are certain things the young
naturalist must learn, and it is well for
him and for the world if he learn them
just as early in his career as possible.
To some of these I would call his atten
tion.
In his methods he must always
be willing to profit by the experiences
of others. Methods and appliances of
research are constantly being improved,
but the improvements are made, not by
disregarding the experience of others,
but by making every possible use of it.
The newly fledged sometimes begin
with the idea that the world was not
discovered until they discovered it, and
they think it perfectly safe to discard
all human experience. This is one of
the signs of a moral disease vulgarly
known as the "big-head." When a
scientific man gets it he never recovers
in time to be of any service to mankind.
I would not have a young man doubt
his own ability; confidence in one's
self, if it be well placed, is an important
element in success, but it doesn't fol
low that when one trusts himself he
should mistrust all the rest of the
world. We hope and believe that the
young man of today is wiser and better
equipped than the young man of any
past generation; but the difference is,
after all, not great, and it is quite Bife
to presume that one's ancestors did
know a few things worth knowing.
The necessity of caution on the part
of the young man in science in publish
ing conclusions that one feels to be open

to criticism, or when he sees that im
portant facts may have been overlooked,
cannot be too strongly emphasized
The publication of facts is generally
useful, but deductions can afford to wait
until they are properly matured. A
most valuable piece of advice once given
me was to the effect that young people
would better not begin pumping out of
their intellectual resorvoirs before some
thing has been pumped into them.
Life is too short, and progress is too
slow, tor us to cumber the march of
scieuce with verbose discussions which
help toward strife and contention in
stead of toward truth and union. "The
longer anyone studies a vast subject, the
more cautious in inference does he be
come." To be sure "ignorance is no
reason with a fool for holding his
tongue"; but my advice is not intended
for fools, who will be fools in spite of
everybody and everything,but for those
who, having sound sense, desire not to
bring discredit upon themselves or upon
the science to which they are devoted.
Scieuce is not infrequently charged
with vacillation. Approps of this some
one remarks: "Scieuce says—but no
matter what science says, for the next
tiaie she says anything she'll say just
the opposite," We cannot deny the
justness of the implied criticism; but
that it is just must beattributed entirely
to premature utterances. We have some
sad examples of scientific men whose
premature conclusions, drawn from too
hasty or incomplete work, have kept
half a dozen good men busy for years in
correcting their mistakes and in putting
the truth before the world. They are
usually men of good enough intentions,
but "we have a right to expect some
thing more than good intentions of
men." All people mean well; it is our
business to do well.
Sensationalism is another thing that
has done, and will probably continue to
do, great injury to all branches of
science. There are certain features
about every science that impress the
uninformed with their novelty, and
there are certain persons who are al
ways ready to make capital out of them.
This gives rise to a sort of "O my!"
class of men and to an "O my!" kind of
science. Such people delight in the
startling; none of the more radical
theories of science, theories put forth by
the right thinking with great caution,
stagger them. In the scientific man's
training the less we have of the sensa
tional the better it will be for science
and for the man.
Those who are at once workers in
science and teachers of science know
how difficult it sometimes is to draw a
sharp line between what we know and
what we simply believe; but so far as
possible this distinction should always
be kept before the minds of students,
and no effort should be spared to pre
vent that dazing of their minds which
prevents them from weighing evidence
and from distinguishing between simple
truth, legitimate hypotheses, and simple
figments of the imagination.
And now just a word about our re
sponsibilities to our own intellects.
Intellect is the tool with which the
man of science has to do his work. If
that tool is bent out of shape or dulled
by improper use, it cannot perform its
functions properly. It is highly es
sential therefore that lie keep his intel
lect unimpaired. He should strive to
keep his mind free from those tricks of
logic, rhetoric, and sentiment by which
so many of us allow ourselves to be im
posed upon. We are bound by every
sentiment of honesty to go whore our
evidence leads us, whether it takes us
to a pleasant place or not. Truth must
be our companion whether she be an
agreeable or a disagreeable one —
a handsome or an ugly one. We can
not honestly say to reason, "Thus far
shalt thou go, but no farther"; we
can't reasonably follow science to a
certain point and then abandon it for
the divining rod or spiritualistic seances
or clap-trap appliances of any kind.
The man who has no notion of accept
ing the results of his reasoning would

jlist as well not reason at all; while he
who undertakes to reason within certain
limits insults his intelligence.
Above all, let me caution young
naturalists against what I may call the
"debating society" style of reasoning.
The debating society is calculated to
increase one's intellectual agility, no
doubt, but as its object is the training
of advocates, its influence on a man of
scieuce is harmful to the last degree,
fora scientific man must be a judge —
uot an advocate.
I take it that it is hardly necessary
to speak here of the necessity of one's
interesting himself in a specialty if he
wishes to accomplish much in the way
of original work nowadays. In sayiug
a word for specialties I am fully aware
of all that has been urged against this
kind of scholarship. The president of
one of our greatest educational institu
tions said to me a few years ago that he
had his doubts and fears about the out
come of this modern tendency among
scientific, men to specialization. Said
lie: "If this thing goes on, we shall
have after a while a man who will know
all about the stripes on a trilobite's tail,
but he won't know anything else." It
is very easy to ridicule a specialist, if
the aims of his studies are not compre
hended. Gaivani studying the twitch
ing of a frog's legs, Darwin breeding
pigeons, and Agassiz plauting sticks on
a glacier, are inspiring or ridiculous in
proportion as we comprehend the bear
ing or end of their studies. Whether
studying the twitching of a frog's legs
or the stripes on a trilobite's tail is an
unworthy and contemptible occupation
for an intelligent man depends, there
fore, upon the motive and the ultimate
objects of the study. And in regard
to special work by those who aspire to
broad culture in science, I can only say
that a man who is incapable of doing
and has not done special investigation
is not capable of taking a broad view of
science in any of its relations. Mr.
Darwin has done some of the best gen
eralizing of our age, but before he did it
he had done some of the best of special
izing, and that too on such unpractical,
uninteresting, and useless animals as
the barnacles.
The necessity of specialties has
sprung from the necessity of a division
of labor in science, just as manual skill
comes from a division of labor in the
arts. Progress depends on such
division.
But while we must confine ourselves
to specialties, care should be taken not
unnecessarily to diminish the field of
our observations. There is a tendency
on the part of a certain class of special
ists to put everything under the micro
scope. This is an excellent way of
seeing some things; but it is as difficult
to examine a landscape with a micro
scope as it is to examine bacteria with
out one. Many questions in scicnce
can be studied satisfactorily only when
we take a broad view of them, and some
discretion must be used in the applica
tion of methods.
Inquiries are often addressed to col
lege professors as to what a student
should take up as a specialty. This is
a matter about which one who is not
flippant is slow to give advice. There
are some general truths, however, that
arc applicable to all cases:
First. You should not mistake your
ambition for your natural calling. It
doesn't follow because you would like
to be a Darwin that you are cut out for
one.
Second. You must not imagine be
cause you love nature that you were
born fora naturalist. This kind of
a mistake is often made by young
people.
It is not to be supposed that the man
who studies plants is necessarily in love
with plants, or that the entomologist is
necessarily in love with insects.
The lover of nature is a poet whose
fancy endows nature'? bare facts with
attributes that the naturalist, as such,
knows nothing about. One sometimes
hears it said that Wordsworth and
Lowell would have made good natural
ists. 1 doubt it; what they say of birds
and trees and flowers and sunshine and
snow are certainly no evidence of ir.
The methods of the ii.au of science
deal not with the beauties of nature as
beauties, but with the taets and laws.
Do you suppose that our great ichthy
ologist is in love with tithes? Not at
all; his interest in fishes is au interest
in natural law. The naturalist is a
classifier; and one must be guided iu
cho< sing natural history as a profession
by the taste and fitness tor clus ification
and for nature's problems, rather than
by one's admiration for the beau'ies ot
the flowers or the sougs of the birds.
Besides, to be a successful man of
science one must go into science very
largely because he can't help it—because
he can't keep out of it. I mean,
of course, that the particular branch
of scieuce he enters must so fill the de
mands of his mind, his temperament,
and his tastes, that in any other occupa
tion he feels that he is not where he
can make the most ot himself and of his
energies. Such men will have that
professional pride, zeal, and ambition,
without which everyone is doomed to a
fatal mediocrity. This point was well
illustrated in the experience of one of
the prominent geologists of this country.
The story of how he found his real
calling was thus told me a short time
ago by his father. Said he: -'Edward
studied civil engineering and did more
or less work at it, and we h id settled it
in our minds that he was to be an
engiueer. Hut I noticed that although
he did good work and rather enjoyed it,
he did'nt go out with the engineers
every time he had a chance, and if he
happeued to want to go with them, it
did'nt take much to divert his attention
from their work; he never offered to
carry stakes or a chain just for the sake
of being where engineering was going
on. Then he took a fancy for mechan
ics, aud studied that diligently for two
or three years, and worked in the shops
till he became pretty skillful, and then
we settled it in our minds that Edward
was going to be a mechanical engineer.
Hut," slid the father, ''after all, [ had
my doubts about it; [ noticed that while
he was a good mechanic we never had
to drag him aw ly from his work; he
was always on time at his meals and he
went to and came from his work as if it
were all a mere matter of duty."
"Finally he took to geology, and then
he lost his whole heart. Days were too
short and nights too long; holidays he
no longer knew; eating and sleeping
became disagreeable necessities; social
duties and everything else than his be
loved science were put off till a more
convenient season." It is hardly neces
sary for me to tell you that that young
man made a geologist of whom we are
all proud.
And this case is no exception, indeed
it is quite a typical one. There
is thus going on a process of natural
selection that puts every man in his
place—that is, where he can best serve
the world; aud such a process makes it
the more necessary that young people
should make no mistakes iu the choice
of a calling or in the preparation for it.
And now I want to say a word about
a part of the naturalist's education that
is not comprehended in his directly pre
paratory studies; at least, not as pre
paratory studies now go in this country,
or in the ethical relations of his profes
sional work.
Though I believe in specialties t am
not disposed to side with those who
think that if a man is to be a specialist
the soouer he begins his specialty the
better. In a general way this proposi
tion is correct, but in making such an
admission it must be distinctly under
stood that all things which tend to
broaden a man's scholarship form essen
tial parts of his specialty. For while i
believe most heartily in specialization I
believe none the less heartily in a
general education for the man of science.
There has been a disposition of late to
rush to the other extreme, largely
beoause the old-fashioned classical t do
nation has, on the whole, been so un
satisfactory.

One should certainly have more than
a single window iu the intellectual
house in which he must pass his life.
Specialize, yes, by all means special
ize, but apart from your specialty see
that your intelligence is properly culti
vated on as many sides as possible
Cirow up—not like a telegraph pole,
useful but bare and ugly —but like a
well proportioned tree with branches on
all sides to gather into your life the
fresh air and the sunshine.
And now as instructors, how are we
of the faculty doing, and how are we
going to do our part of this broadening
of education.
I would here recall the case
of the young geologist who, after
certain feeling about, settled into the
work he could do most satisfactorily.
All young people cannot have such
experiences; the majority of them lack
the time, the means aud the opportuni
ties. They ask, and I ask for them,
how they are to find out their capabili
ties. There is but one way for the
majority of people to fiud out this vital
point and that is by getting a kind of
bird's-eye view of science and letters;
aud if there is one duty more than an
other that rests ou a college faculty it is
to let young men and young women have
this view of the broader possibilities of
life, and to see that they get it while
they are in college. After they have
hail such a view is time enough for
them to be left to choose careers and
specialties; for then, and not till then,
can they have opinions based on any
thing else than mere whim or ignorant
fancy, Pardon a homely illustration of
this fact. When a very small boy I
once heard this conversation between
two little playmates: "Jim, what you
goin' to be when you're a man?" "I'm
goin' to be a preacher." "What you
goin' to be a preacher for?" "So 1
won't have to work; and I can always
wear good clothes, and I'll be sure to
go to heaven when I die." That child's
fancy fixed the man's destiny, and today
he is a clergyman. And I have no
doubt that similar oases are known to
every person within my hearing.
As matters now stand, we, who ought
to be the wisest counsellors of young
people, often act the part of real estate
agents, who have certain pieces of prop
pertv for sale and are determined that
the investor shall take what we have to
offer without giving him an opportunity
to see the chances of the market Young
men who ought to have their views of
life's possibilities broadened, are driven
into, or allowed to drift into, a hope
less materialism—allowed to plow up
their front yards, as it were, in order
to plant them in pumpkins and prunes
or something else out of which money
can be made.
I once made this remark: "That a
naturalist should have a knowledge of
history, philosophy, social science, and
of literature iu general, goes without
saying."
Since that was written the ideas re
garding the elective system have gone
to such extremes that it is no longer dif
ficult to find those who would allow a
student to devote himself to a single
branch or to cognate branches
to the exclusion of all others.
One often hears it said that these speci
alists are sent out in their senior year
to get some knowledge of other branches
Hut what is the use of sending them
out when they must euter other
branches as specialists—when they must
devote two or three years to a study of
special topics in place of getting a gen
eral comprehension of the subject in
one year. And our courses of study,
almost without exception, are now so
arranged that they are accessible or
useful only to those who wish to pursue
them as specialties. Students from
other departments are not regarded as
having any rights or claims worth con
sidering, much less providing for.
Does any one fancy fora moment
that men put through such courses of
study »re educated? We have had a
•treat deal of fun poked at the old-fash
ioned Greek-Latin-Mathematics educa
tion, but to be perfectly frank with our

selves, is not tbistort of thing just a
little worse than thai? We should put
it to ourselves whether the scientific de
partments eau justly set up such a bar
rier to the education of students from
the literary courses, and vice versa.
It is unquestionably more interesting
to lay out and give instruction in courses
of study for special students, but unless
I make a big mistake we are here for the
benefit of students, and it is our busi
ness to think of what is best for them
and for those outside of our departments
as well as for those in them.
It may be objected that the general
instruction I refer to belongs to the pre
paratory schools. Perhaps it does; but
we all know that the preparatory schools
do not give it, and until they do it is
the business of the higher institutions
of learning. In connection with such
discussions we are constantly reminded
of what the German universities do or
do not. It is useless for us to flatter
ourselves by such comparisons. Our
students have no such preparation as
those entering tht German universities,
and until they do have it, it is our plain
duty to deal with the conditions as we
find them, hoping that they may im
prove, and doing what we can to make
them improve.
What sort of scholars or scientific
men or technologists are we going to
have if we insist that one must be a
specialist or nothing, and that he must
know that specialty and nothing else?—
for that is really what it ootnes to in
practice.
There comes up to us from the busy
ranks of every day life a constant warn
ing that specialists without culture and
all-round education a r e, in a sense,
failures. Here is what the late Mr.
Ilolly, one of our ablest, most experi
enced, and most highly esteemed engi
neers, has said on this subject as it
affects the engineering professions: "It
is useless to disguise the fact that the
want not of high scholarship but of
liberal and general education is today
the greatest of all the embarassments
which the majority of engineering ex
perts aud managers encounter." And,
so far as my observations go. what he
says of engineering is true of every
other branch of science.
My principal reason for saying so
much on the subject of specialties is
that there has evidently been a mistake
made about it. 1 meao that the intel
ligent supporters of specialties have
either overstated the case or else wrong
constructions have been put upon their
real meaning.
I have known the very high priest
of special education himself to deplore
the fact that a certain exce.lent spec
ialist didn't have enough general edu
cation to be a presentable person—that
he knew nothing outside of his special
ty; in short, that he had made of him
self a subordinate, fit only for the
narrow line of work he had followed at
the suggestion (as he understood it) of
that very scholar.
I am a thorough, enthusiastic, and
whole-souled believer in specialties: the
whole hope of progress for enlighten
ment and civilization lies there; but I
am none the less a believer iu general
culture. And if our specialists are to be
living, intelligent, sympathetic factors
in the progress of humanity, they must
have liberal educations. A lofty struc
ture cannot be built upon a narrow foun
dation, neither can a man be great iu
science who has not broad culture.
