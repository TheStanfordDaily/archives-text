# Dr. Jordan's Address to the Graduating Class.

### 
As you go forth from us this morn
ing it falls to me to give you one last
word of message. It shall be a plain
word, but I trust an earnest one, a word
in behalf of the country to which we be
long and in which the work of our lives
is to be accomplished.
If the experiment of government by
the people is to be successful, it is you
who must make it so. 'J'he future of
the Republic must lie in the bands of
the men and women of culture and in
telligence, of sell-control and of self
resources. If it falls not in such hands,
the republic will have no future
There is no virtue in democracy as such,
uothiug in Americanism as such, that
will save us if we are a nation of weak
lings and fools with an aristocracy ot
kuaves as our masters. We are told
that our civilization and our govern
ment are fit only for the days of cotton
and corn prosperity. We are told that
the days of self-control and self-sufliei
ency are over, and that the people of
this nation are really typified by the
lawless bunds rushing blindly hither
and thither clamoring for laws by which
those men may be rich whom all previ
ous laws of God and man have ordained
to be poor. The Anglo Saxon race is
not to be kept down; ours is a lineage
untainted by luxury, uncorroded by vice,
uncrushed by oppression. If it were
not so, we could not be here today.
For more than a century now, the
common man has ruled America. IIow
has he used his power? it is too soon
to answer. A hundred years'is a time
too short for the test of such gigautic
experiments. Here in America we
have made history already; some of it
glorious, some of it ignoble. We find
that the social problems of Europe can
not be kept away from us by the guar
anty of democracy. We find that the
dead which the dead past cannot bury
are thrown up on our shores. We fiud
that weakness, misery, and crime are
still with us, aud that wherever weak
ness is there is tyranny also We fiud
that in the free air of America there are
millions who can never be free under
any government or under any laws, so
long as they remain what they are.
The problem of life is not to make life
easier, but to make men stronger, so
that no problem shall be beyond their
solution. There is no growth without
its struggle Nature asks of man that
he use his manhood. If a man puts no
part of his brains and soul into his daily
work, if he feels no pride in the part he
is taking in life, the sooner he leaves the
world the better. His work is the
work of a slave; and his life the waste
of so much good oxygen. The misery
he endures is nature's testimony to his
worthlessness. We cannot save him
from nature's penalty. Our duty to
wards him may be to temper justice
with mercy. Our duty towards his
children is to see they do not follow his
path The grown up men and women
of today are in a sense past saving.
The best work of the republic is to save
the children. If this generation should
leave as its legacy to the next the real
education, training in individual power
and skill, breadth of outlook on the
world and on life, the problems of the
next century would take care of them
selves.
In this direction lies, T believe, the
answer to all industrial and social prob
lems. Reforms in education are the
greatest ot all reforms. The idealeduc
ation should give to each man or wo
man that rescrvestrength without which
no life can be successful, because no life
can be free. With this reserve, the

man can face difficulties, because the
victor in any struggle is he who lias
most staying power. He should have
a reserve of property. Thrift is a vir
tue. Because there are men who are
greedy—drunk with the intoxication of
wealth and power—we sometimes are
told that wealth and power are criminal.
In the world we know, the free man
should have a reserve of power, and
this power is represented hy money.
Education must take the form of real
patriotism, of public interest, and of
civic virtue. The problems of govern
ment are problems of right and wrong.
They can be settled only in one way:
they must be settled right. What
ever is settled wrong comes up for
settlement again, and this when we
least expect it. It comes up under
harder conditions, and compound inter
est is charged on every wrong decision.
The slavery question, you remember,
was settled over and over again by each
generation of compromisers.
It is the same with every national
question, large or small. Thus it will
be with the tariff, with finance, with
the civil service. Each question must
be settled right and we must pay for its
settlement. It is said that fifteen per
cent, of the laws on the statute books
of the states of the Union stand there
in defiance of acknowledged laws of
social and economic science. Around
every such law will gather a festering
sore. Such statutes are steadily in
creasing in number, concessions by
short-sighted legislatures to the arro
gant monopolist, the ignorant dema
gogue, or the reckless agitator.
It was the dream of the founders of
this republic that each year the people
should choose from their numbir "their
wisest men to make the public laws."
The men who founded America were
her educated men. This condition
could not always last. As the country
grew ignorance and greed developed,
and these two must, be represented.
We have come to choose in our law
makers not rulers but representatives;
we ask not wisdom but watchfulness for
our personal interests; so we send those
who act as our attorneys. And thus it
has come about, that demagogues and
special agents make up the body of law
makers in this country, and this in both
parties alike. They represent not our
wisdom but our business. They are the
riflex of the people they represent; no
better, and certainly no worse. In this
degree republican government has
failed. For this failure there is again
but one remedy—education. We must
have in every community men trained
in social and political science. We
must have men with the courage of
their convictious, and only the educated
man has any real convictions. We
must have men who know there is a
right to every question as well as many
wrongs. Very few men ever do that
which they kuow and really believe to
be wrong.
If representative government is ever
to bring forward wisdom and patriotism,
it will be because they exist and de
mand representation. Every question
of public policy is a question of right
and wrong. There is no virtue in the
acts of ignorant majorities. Truth is
strong and error is weak.
Right thiuking has been your priv
ilege: right acting is now your duty —
and at no time in the history of the
world has duty been more imperative
than now.
As you go forth from us this morn
ing it falls to me to give you one last
