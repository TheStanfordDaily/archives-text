# THE
						BACCALAUREATE SERMON.
## 
### Bishop Goodsell 
In spite of the few students remain
ing on the campus a crowded chapel
greeted Bishop Goodsell of the Meth
odist Episcopal Church on Sunday
morning last. He bad been invited to
deliver the baccalaureate sermon and to;
launch upon the world the Class of '04.
After several introductory hymns, and,
a reading of the nineteenth Psalm by
Dr Jordan, Bishop Goodsell rose and
spoke from the text I Samuel ix, 6:
"And he said unto him, Behold now, !
there is in this city a man of God, and he
is an honorable man; all that he sai h
cometh surely t,« pass: now let us go
thither; peradventure he can show us our
way that we should go."
lie began by speaking of the value of
the Scriptures; of their invasiveness;
and of their universal power regarded
from whatever standpoint we choose,
lie continued extemporaneously in th*e
following strain : "The passage 1 have
just read to you comes to me with a I
message which 1 hope to translate for
you. It refers to a simple event in j
Oriental lib: a young man was search
ing for his father's asses, and went |
astray; he turned to a higher power for
guidance, and found assistance from
'the man of God.' These men of God
have been the saviors of the ages; they
rise above the mass of humanity as the
mountain peaks rise above the foothills.
They were the most cultivated men of
the time, and have lived in memory
while the rulers and governors and
mighty men of the time arc nameless
and unknown.
"These men had an intense faith in
the existence of a supreme ruier. not a
faith of an intellectual, historical char
acter, like the belief in the existence of
some long-gone hero, but a faith that
made them feel that their inmost life
and smallest action was directed by this
power they regarded so reverentially.
Their faith was a vital energy These ,
men though ancient are yet modern;
their experience and thought is linked
to ours, for they found the evidences of j
their faith in the same nature to which
we turn to find support for our faith, j
They reached after the supreme by and '
through the world in which they lived
They lived close to nature, under the i
stars in the immediate presence of the
power inspiring the throbbing world.
They felt this power to be a love of
righteousness. Their ethics were dif
ferent from ours; they did many things
that eannot be excused under the
Christian dispensation. They saw that
the wicked might prosper fora season; |
but they knew that spiritual services;
were paid for in spiritual coin. The
prophets who stood for God will ever
live, while the fame of the warriors and
destroyers of the time has perished long
ago; not that there are not many other
ways of gaining fame and reputation,
but the most enduring name is gained
by him who has a true message that
will raise humanity, and who has re
ceived his message from a divine source.
"All these men had a message for
the world, and we have a message.
We cannot hold our righteousness from
the world; we must listen to what the
divine voices, everywhere heard in
nature, have to say, and must he guided
by them. The truth found in nature
is God's truth, and I do not fear it.
The thing I fear, and what is disastrous
to us, is the half truth. Listen to nil
the voices that are to be heard, guide
your life by them. The man who fails
because of crime or vice is the man who
has listened to a single passion of his
own instead of listening to the great
cry of the universe. Any man who
does anything worthily in the world
ought to be one of its preachers.
"Two pictures rise before me, young
men and women: Either you are to
climb upward and onward with broad
ening vision to a greater freedom from
prejudice and with grander views of
human destiny, or you are to be tram
elled by appetites born of passion until
the body shall become corrupt and pol

luted by your own sin. These two
paths are before you. The first one
includes love of God, love of truth as
an expression of the divine, love ot man
as the field in which the divine op
erates. We must lit ourselves for this
part. The world itself is part ol the
Christian gospel.
"Neither the president of this Uni
versity nor L can attempt to say what
your career shail be; that will be deter
mined partly by accideot, partly by
friends, partly by aptitude. Our paths
have been divergent until this morning,
when they meet at a common point,
and they will diverge and continue to
diverge from this time on. Amid all
the disappointments, uncertainties, and
stragglings that are before you, this
one thing is true, no matter to what ex
tent our paths may diverge, that he
who carries within him the guidance of
a lofty and inspired conscience and is
enamoured of truth goes on to what is
best for him and toward that higher
service in which I believe with all my
heart. Whither you go Ido not know.
None of us know. You do not know —
God knows. But I know that some of
you are to move on with hope and cour
age fora time, and then are to be smit
ten just as the bud is about to bloom;
while others are to go on and on and
ally themselves to the eternal forces of
righteousness and truth, not to be lost
in unconsciousness, but to acquire
knowledge, and develop power, and be'
come a higher minister of the highest
things. I beseech you to pardon thi?-
imperfect presentation of a truth of
which i have a slight shadow in uiv
soul."
