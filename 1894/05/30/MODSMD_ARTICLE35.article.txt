# LAST MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATED STUDENTS.
## A
						Literary Monthly Not Acceptable. 
### 
On the afternoon of Friday, May
the student body met at the call
ot nineteen petitioners to transact
special business before the close of the
college year. At halt-post one the
chapel was well filled, and the later ar
rivals made it crowded. 80 large a
number had not been seen at a similar
meeting during the year, and possibly
not during the first year, when nearly
everyone attended such meetings.
A combination of rumors, causing
apprehension and curiosity, had in
duced the crowd t > come out at a time
of year when most everything else is
neglected in preparation for the final
examinations. The primary object ol
the meeting was the consideration ol
the practicability of allowing a liter >ry
monthly to be published by authority of
the Associated Students. In addition
to this matter va«zue hints had been
thrown out that certain radical moves |
would be made, among which would be j
an attempt to overthrow the recent
election carried on by the Board of J
Control of this paper. This hint alone
probably had more influence than all
else in collecting a large number who
were determined to uphold what bad
been a fair choice of the bourd. How
ever, as the business went on no men
tion was made of the matter; and many
have since wondered if anything is
lonirer than it really ought to be.
Zion, '94, as president of the student
body, was chairman of the meeting.
After the call to order and usual read
ing of the minutes there was a lengthy
pause. Everyone wondered what would
be done first and who would do it. The
chairman announced that the petitioners
had requested a meeting in order to
present before the students a proposition
for a monthly publication, and he called
upon some one interested to take the
initiative. Hulme, '90, arose and
moved that the constitution of the new
paper be adopted, which caused some
amusement among critical parliamen
tarians, for it had not yet been read.
He then explained that his ignorance ol
parliamentary practice left him at a loss
what to do, inasmuch as the person who
was to have presented the constitution
was absent. The draft of the proposed
constitution was read, and it soon be
came evident that several factional ele
ments were on hand to oppose that
which it aimed at—the establishment
of another paper in the University with
the authority of the Associated Students
behind it. The list of editors whom it
was proposed should be declared in
office for the first term was read to
attentive listeners, for there had been
many surmises as to who were interested
in the new enterprise. Calhoun, '95,
Hulme, '96, Miss (Jomstock, '90, Miss
Oowen, '97, Miss K. Ilerrick, '95,
Neidig, '96, Kice, '95, Palmer, '97,
Cram, '90, J. Ilerrick, '96, Hughes, '95,
were the names read.
Discussion for and against engaged
the meeting for some time. Some of
the speakers were Collins, Zion, and
Cathcart, who spoke against the propor
tion, and Hulme and Calhoun, who spoke
in support of it; and the usual number
of parliamentary cranks displayed their
individual knowledge. Zion spoke
from the house, calling President-elect
Hinsdill to the chair, and characterized
the undertaking as the apparent growth
of a "sore head" movement; for it was
well known that four ot the list read
had been unsuccessful candidates for
editor-in-chief 011 the two college papers.
The greatest fear that seemed to
possess the student body was lest the
business of the two papers already in
the Univorsity should be impaired by
solicitations from a third paper for
advertising. Several students who
have managed publications here gave
it as their opinion that another paper
must of necessity solicit advertising in
the same field that is already harvested
by the daily and the weeklv, which

constantly come in contact, the one
arriving first, upon the scene generally
securing the only advertisement given
to the University.
Much promiscuous and idle talk was
eugaged in as to the literary merits of
the S'quoiu, but the source of adverse
criticism was not most. influential.
A vote to accept the constitution was
supported by only about a third of the
house; so a literary monthly will not be
issued from the University at the begin
ning of next year at least.
Some mention was made of the ille
gality of the election held by the Hoard
of Directors of the Sequoia just before
the meeting of the Associated Students,
and clauses in the constitution of the
Sequoia were cited in support of the
assertion that all rights not delegated
to the board remain vested in the
Associated Students. The right to fill
vacancies after the expiration of the
time limit of election is not delegated
to the board; so, literally speaking,
Rose and Ilicks were not. legally elected
to the position they assumed upon the
resignation last December of Chamber
lin and Hughes as editor and business
manager respectively of the weekly, nor
could authority for Kwell's recent elec
tion as manager be found in the Se
quoia constitution. Zion ruled, how
ever, that in us much as no complaint
had been heard where such actions had
occured before, he would base liis decis
ion upon the precedent established.
This brought forth a retort from the
house that the chairman had seen fit to
declare illegal an election of a football
manager under analogous conditions
when he himself wished to be a cadi
date for the position before the student
body.
'• he meeting adjourned, and"three
cheers for Pollock" were given as an
expression of satisfaction that the man
ager-elect of the daily was assured of
his position.
