### 
Arrangements were completed in Sau
Francisco yesterday afternoon between
tbe U. C. and Stanford football manag
ers for an inter-freshman game to lie
played at Central I'ark, San Francisco,
on Dec. 8, between the two university
classes of '08.
Negotiations have been pending
between Long. '05, tbe Berkeley man
ager, and llicks, '96, our manager, for
such a contest, an 1 the final agreement
was drawn up aiul signed at tbe meet
ing yesterday. The point at issue was
the definition of a freshman, on which
the two managers could not agree owing
to tbe different systems of tbe two uni
versities. A bonafide first, year student
was finally decided to be the definition
of a freshman.
