## 
### 
The shareholders of the Co operative
Association met in the chapel ou the
afternoon of Thursday, ISlay 17th, f' r
the regular annual election of a board
of directors. The greater part of the
voting was done by proxies submitted
by a few members who had solicited
the privilege from others who were
more or less disinterested in the choice
of a board. The result of the balloting,
which continued slowly through the
whole afternoon, was the election of the
following board: Prof. Marx; Diggles,
'95; Gilliam,'96; Entler,'9s; Ross, '97;
Tregea, '90; Miss Hill, '90; Doherty,
'95; Sand wick, '95.
The new board met ou Saturday, the
191.h, to elect a manager for the Co-op.
Collins, '95, Hazzard, '95, and I'.
White, '95, had been the only candi
dates that were mentioned for this
position during the electioneering for
directors, and the general opinion
seemed to be that the contest would
be between Collins and llazzard.
To the surprise of every one a dark
horse was run and elected. J. M.
Stowell, gr., of Morrison, 111., was the
successful candidate.
Stowell taught school in the east for
three years. At Knox College, Cales
burg, 111., he was business manager of
the Co-operative Association for one
vear before coming to California, and fur
fifteen months after his arrival in this
state he was enuaged with a partner in
real estate dealings at College Park.
