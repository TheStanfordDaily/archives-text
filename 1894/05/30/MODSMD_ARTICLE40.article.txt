by the co-operative book store. In
most cases only approximate numbers
are given, but they are fairly near the
exact amounts, which cannot be secured
in detail from former years' records.
During the first two months of the
first colie»e year, 1891-92, the Co
operative Association did not exist, but
in the next seven months the sales
amounted to about &(i 000, and A. .J
Brown, '92, as manager cleared about
$450. In 1892-93 the sales were
about 89,0U0. E. L. Rich. '9.°». was
manager, and cleared about 8050 during
the nine months of the college year.
This year the sales reached 811.000,
netting the manager, E. L). Mugee, 95,
about ¥800.
Each manager employed an assistant,
who spent a few hours each day at the
store, and who whs paid about 820 per
month. Deducting the assistant's sal
ary it will be seen that for eight months'
work in the first year (it requires a
month's extra work in ordering and ar

ranging for stock) the first manager
made on an average about $30 per
month; the second, over $45 per month
for ten months' work; and the third,
over $60 per month for ten months'
work.
The Co-op. lias $1,500 worth of books
and stationery in stock, besides $550 in
cash. Should next year's business have
the same proportional increase of sales
over the preceding year the position of
manager ought to be worth $800, or an
average of $80 per month.
