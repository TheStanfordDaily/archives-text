A brief review of the four semesters
that the Daily Palo Alto has been
published will show that it is steadily
increasing in prosperity. The daily be
gan publication in September, 1892,
and iu the first four months Sawyer,
'94, and Smith, '93, who were then
manager and editor respectively, cleared
about $100, which was shared between
them iu the ratio of two to one. Con
sidering the difficulty with which the
pioneers in any t-uch enterprise must
contend, it is enough that the business
was made to pay anything.
During the second semester of 1892
-93 Ziou, '94, and Wilson, '94, had
charge of the paper and cleared $300,
two-thirds of which went to the man
ager, Zion, and the remainder to the!
editor. The expenses of publication j
for the semester were kept down to
$050 and the advertisements yielded
$075. Subscriptions netted $275.
The fiist semester of the present col- j
lege year llazzard, '95, and Trumbo,
'94, made about $500, over $100 of
which is still outstanding. According
to the new ratio of division of profits the
editor received two fifths of the gain.

Unfortunately the accounts for this
semester will not be squared tip for sev
eral days and nothing like an accurate
estimate can be given. It is sufficient
to say, though, that the net gain for this
semester will exceed that of the Sequoia,
whicli was $550.
A brief statement of the increase of
net profits is shown by the following:
Sawyer and Smith, four months, $17
and ยง8 respectively per month; Zion
and Wilson, five months, 840 and 820
per month; Hazzard and Trumbo, four
months, 875 and $50 per month; Col
lins and Itice, five months, probably in
excess of the last amounts.
