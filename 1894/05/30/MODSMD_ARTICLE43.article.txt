# That Boat Club Debt.
## 
### 
During the enthusiasm awakened
about a year and a half ago when it was
contemplated tliat Stanford would send
a crew to the intercollegiate regatta at
the World's Fair, a boat club was
formed. Ds birth was heralded to the
world, and the prospectivec'ub received
a sort of christening gift of §800 from
Senator and Mrs. Stanford with which
to purchase the necessary shell. At
the same time a boat huuse on the east
bank of Laguuita was contracted for, j
although prospective initiation fees from ;
the members were the only source of
revenue that the club had from which i
to pay for the structure, for the $800 i
could not be used for that purpose.
A shell was not purchased, for it was
found that Lagunita did not furnish the J
desired expanse of water and that San
Francisco bay, while not over three
miles away, was inaccessible because of
swampy or tule land intervening. As
the months passed by the crew became i
only a vision of past imagination, but
the boat house and the fact that it was
not paid for were visible realities. Several
efforts were made to arouse enthusiasm;
new members were induced to join; and
the indebtedness was reduced to $18U,
which a benefitconcert failed to diminish.
Just before the close of this semester
the president of the club, Bancroft, '95,
and the treasurer, llazzard, '9(5, were
apprised that their chattels were to be
attached as tangible securities for the
club's debt. Both persons lost no time
in boxing up their effects and hurrying
them off. Then the individual mem
bers became apprehensive for their own
worldly goods, for an officer was said t >
be round the Palo Alto station to in
spect the names on trunks about to be
sent away. Some of the members are
said to have shipped their effects from
Mayfield station. The climax was
reached when papers were to be served
on Dr. Angell, Dr. Wood and Prof.
Richardson, the faculty members of the
executive committee whom the club had
elected to that position of respect and
distinction. l)r. Wood had his papers
served on him, but before the other two
were served the first one was recalled
and the prosecution in that quarter was
hurridly quashed by legal advise.
It seems that some legal demonstra
tion was necessary on the part of the
creditor, Parkinson, the lumber dealer
of Palo Alto, for if none were made be
fore May 21 his right to claim the
amount would expire by the statute of
limitations Most of the club members
left for their homes before the end of
last week but those few who remained
on the campus made a compromise with
the creditor. Fifty dollars in cash and
forty dollars in notes, secured by Jud<:e
Campbell of Palo Alto, were accepted
by Parkinson; proceedings were stopped;
and several lovers of aquatic sports
breathed easy once more, for they had
poured oil on troubled waters and
secured a calm —a safe departure for
home with their baggage. The bill is
receipted for the whole amount, so it is
left with the honor of the club members
to pay the balance of $90, for all right
of action to enforce its payment has
been released.
