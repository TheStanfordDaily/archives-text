The much-discussed Hawaiian Island
trip will not he taken by tl<e Varsity
nine this summer The teaui leit Si.n
Francisco yesterday for Portland,
Oregon.
It was impossible for Walton, the
first baseman, Dyer, the third baseman,
and Harrelson, the left fielder, to make
the summer trip with the team. Unless
some changes were made at the last
moiucut the following ten men started
on the trip: Kussell, McLaine, Weldon,
(Calhoun, Bumiller, Hay, Lewis, Kd
Rea, Sheehan, and Davey.
Davey will eateli, although Russell
will alternate between outfield and be
hind the bat. Weldon and MoLairie
will take turns in the box and on the
third bag Calhoun will cover the
initial b se, and Lewis will play short.
Sheehan will captain the team from his
old position in centre field, and Bumiller
will look out for second base.
It is the intention of the team to
visit the towns round l'uget Sound first,
and then to secure games at Portland
and in the Williamette Valley. The
trip, which will occupy three weeks,
will not be a great financial success, but
the players anticipate a good outing. It
has already been intimated that they
will be given rousing receptions and
shown many pleasant social courtesies,
for the northern country is noted for its
hospitality and its interest in Stanford.
The members of the team will dis
perse to their homes after the season's
games are played, unless it is thought
advisable to make a tour of Southern
California. Very tempting offers have
been made to the management to visit
Texas and New Orleans, but they will
not be accepted.
