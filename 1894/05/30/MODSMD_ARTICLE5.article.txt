# Defeat of the Seniors by the Faculty: Score 20 to 12.
## 
### 
The great social athletic event of the
semester was the annual Faculty-Senior
baseball game on the campus Saturday
the 10th.
Whether or not there was method in
the seniors' play may never be known,
but later developments have shown that
not one of the seniors who composed
the nine out of which the ball-playing
faculty took so much satisfaction, was
denied his coveted A. B.
The seniors were uniformed in a very
startling combination of baseball suits
and silk hats, while the faculty appeared
in—well anything that answered to the
name of clothes. The '04- men were
soon compelled to discard their gaudy
tiles, however, and settle down to busi
ness. Hrown of the seniors could not
sail the ball over the plate in the first
inning and forced in two ruus by bases
ou balls, while Dr. Howard brought in
two more by his single.
In the seniors' half Zumwalt knocked
a vicious one through Dr. Wood;
Youog made a two-bagger; and Wilson
made a hit, and stole all the way home.
In the third the seniors made six errors
which, with Prof, llicliardson'8 two
bagger, netted the faculty four runs ad
ditional. The seniors made but one run.
Brown was hit for a double and two
singles with a result of three ruus in
the fourth. Again the seniors could
score but one run.
From this on the game was about
even. The faculty had so many runs
to spare that they did not exert them
selves as they might. The final score
was 20 to 12 in favor of the faculty, but
it is possible, as one of the play
ers remarked, that this was
the result of too much "midnight
|
oil" by the seniors. The fielding of
the faculty team was reuiaikable; only
four errors were charged to the infield,
two of these being made by substitutes, j
Mr. Stearns especially was sure on
grounders. The all-round work of the
out fielders was the feature of the sen
iors' play. The battery placers were i
exceedingly wary base-runners; each j
battery secured uneven number of stolen ;
bases.
