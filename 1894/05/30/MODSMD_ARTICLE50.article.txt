# To the Members of the Faculty.

### 
Desiring to place our cooperative
hook store ou a firmer looting we ad
dress you, asking your hearty co-opera
tion. We are firmly convinced that
this association can only be made a
success through the assistance of the
faculty.
If some of the professors send in a
large order for bouks and in a year's
time change the text, leaving a large
stock on the manager's hards, and fur
ther, order new books through some
city firm instead of co-operating with
the manager and giving him some ad
vice about buying new stockâ€”we say,
that if this should be done in very
many cases, as it has been done in a
few instances, no board of directors or
business manager could make a success
of the business.
Some members of the faculty have
shown a great deal of discretion and
care it) the method of ordering new
books, viz : requiring each student, to
sign his or her name on a list before
it is handed to the business manager.
Some such method is very commendable.
We understand that the business
manager will send each member of the
faculty a blank which it is expected
will be filled out and returned as soon
as possible.
It is too late now, of course, to follow
out some of the suggestions previously
made, but we must again ask that great
care be taken in making up orders.
The sooner the order sheet is in the
better, for then the manager can send
it on and have the books shipped by
freight. Remember that, the express
aye on books increases their value fully
twelve or fifteen per cent, above the
cost when shipped by freight.
