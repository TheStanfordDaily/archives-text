# The 						Faculty Nine Defeats the Senior-Graduate Nine.
## 
### 
The faculty baseball nine has added
another to its already long string of
victories. Having met and overwhelm
ingly beaten the seuior and the post
graduates separately, it proceeded last
Wednesday afternoon to celebrate the
eud of University work by defeating
them collectively. The combiuatiou
team was a job-lot aggregation of stars
picked from both the graduates and
seniors, but their efforts were all in
vaiu. They were outplayed at the bat,
in the field, and on the base linos. The
faculty players pranced about like colts
and plainly showed that the arduous
mental toil of the college professor had
not made them forget their pristine skill
with the ball and bat.

Two base hits—Stearns. Sacrifice hits
—Zumwalt. Zion. Double plays—Zum
wait to Ashley ; Durand unassisted. Base
on balls—by Fish 1, by Durand 5. Struck
out by Fish 5, by Durand 9. Passed
balls—Richardson 2. Wild pitches—Fish
1, Durand 1. First on errors—Graduates
5, Faculty 5. Left on bases—Faculty 6,
Graduates 3. Umpire—Davey, '96.
The principal feature of the game
was the excellent fielding of Dr. An
gell. He covered ground like a pro
fessional, and made some of the most
startling stops and pick-ups ever seen on
the home diamond.
Mr. Steams did great work in his
position and cut off several hits. Zum
walt is an old player, but he seemed
temporarily to forget what to do with
the ball when he got it. It was almost
impossible for him to handle it without
making an error. Richardson at second
was in a new position for him, but, barr
ing the fact that he was slightly afraid
of the ball, he played a better game
than was expected. Prof. Anderson
managed to secure his usual bases on
balls, distinguishing himself by two in
one inning. Following is the score:
