The table here given was compiled
by Caspar W. Whitney for Harper's
\\eckly of May 10. It shows that we
beat our English cousins at the quarter
mile run, the 120 yard hurdle, the two
mile bicycle, the running high jump,
and the 10 lb. shot put. We tie them
in the 101) yard dash and the runuing
broad jump. They excel our college
athletes in the half mile, the mile, and
the three mile runs. Since this table
was prepared the intercollegiate record
for the 10 lb. hammer throw has been
increased 12 ft. 8 in, by Patterson of
Cornell, who udded 43 ft. 2 in. to the
Cornell record with a throw 123 ft. 2 in.
