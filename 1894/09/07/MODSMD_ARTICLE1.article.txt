# Financial Standing of the University.
## 
### 
Amid the chaos ot the past summer
there has arisen a claim, brought in the
name of the United States Government,
against the Stauford estate, This claim,
involving a large sum of mouey, has
natuially caused an uneasiness in the
minds of all those interested in the Uni
versity Sensational articles iu the
daily press have tended to increase the
uncertainty in some localities, and the
real state of the University affairs is
understood by but few.
The lemporary embarrassment for
ready uiouuy of one year ago was due to
the settlement of the estate upon the
death of Senator Stauford When the
estate went into the probate courts the
income of the University, derived from
direct sources, was cut. off No money
could come from thai source until
all claims against the estate had hern
met and all legacies paid, so that the
University was thrown for support upon
ihe allowance of Mrs. Stanford and the
income from the three University estates.
These sources of income have, however,
been adequate to the maintenance ot
the University in its present degree ol
expansion
When Mr. Olney brought this claim
against the estate, all debts both per
ho lal and corp .rite of Sena oi" Manlord
had been paid, the estate was fiee from
obligati us i xcepr unpaid legacies, and
the University owed nothing and every
thing seemed favorable for an immedi
ate development ot the great plan ol the
founders of the University. The Uluey
claim is in brief as follows: The secoud
mortgage of the government against the
Central Pacific R. R. will soon become
due and the theory is that the original
stockholders are held liable for the bal
ance if the raiload on foreclosure
should not sell enough to pay the first
and second The theory
rests on a technicality, based on a law
ol California intended to prevent the
formation of irresponsible corporations.
This provides that the original stock
holders in any corporation shall be
liable for any aud all obligations of the
company, providing suit is brought
within three years from date of organ
ization. The technicality is, that the
Feder.il Government in its own courts
is not bound by the statute of limita
tions; therefore this three years limit
passed twenty years might not hold
as against the United States It has,
however, been repeatedly decided that
when the United States goes into state
courts or takes advantage of state laws
it must be bound by them as any other
plaintiff would be This line of argu
ment has been accepted as sound by all
the lawyers to whom the case has been
submitted, including Mr. Olney him
self aud a number of prominent attor
neys in the senate. In law and equity,
whatever claim the government has
against the ''eutral Pacific must be ex
hausted on the property itself and can
not affect other property held by heirs
of original stockholders.
This claim will undoubtedly be
thrown out of court at once when it is
broght to trial, and friends ol" the Uni
versity are making every effort to have
the matter brought to a speedy decision.
Until thiß claim is out of the way, no
legacies can be paid or any of the estate
used for the University. When it is
settled the whole estate will be given to
the University, for it is publicly an
nounced that, with the exception of a
few personal gifts and testimonials,
Mrs Stanford will 1. ase to the Univer
sity all property which may be in her
possession. The value of this estate is
estimated at. $17,000,000 by the official
appraisers. In better times the esti

mate could bo safely doubled. The Uni
versity wan the joint Stan
ford and his wife to the people of the
United States. It was the wish of one
founder that the other be able to do not
less that he.
At the present time the University
maintains itself with its 80 instructors
and 1100 stu ients from the earnings of
the three University tracts, Vina, Palo
Alto, and Gridley, with the help of Mrs.
Stanford When the estate is relieved
lorn the claim in question, by the gen
erosity of Mrs. Stanford a very large
sum, from $500,000 to $1,000,000 will
be virtually added to its present in
come.
Should the matter in question be set
tled in a manner favorable to the Uni
versity, it would scon possess an income
much greater than any other institution
in America and the plans of its founders
as to buildiugs and development could
be entered on at once.
In any event, the doors of the Univer
sity will never close and even its pres
ent income will enable it to maintain
the leafing position it has assumed from
ilie very first. It may be that in the
words of a contemporary, "The glamour
of Stanford gleams no loimtr,'" but in
this case the solid lustre of thorough
and earnest work has taken its place.
For the growth nf the University this is
better than "glamour." The pro
spects are that in tlie future neither
work nor '-glamour" will be wanting.
