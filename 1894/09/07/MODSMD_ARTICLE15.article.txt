# Stanford's “Daily."
## 
### 
For the benefit of uew students it
may be desirable to make some state
ments concerning the relation of the
Daily Halo Alto to the student body.
The publication of the dailyr began
early in the fall semester of '92. The
first, ten issues were priuted at Red
wood City uuder trying circumstances
With some difficulty a plant was se
cured and the pub.ication was continued
on the campus. The typographical
work is done entirely by student labor,
»nd in this respect the Daily Palo
Alto stands alone, no other college
daily being able to say the same. It
was largely due to the energy and skill
of the student now in charge of the
printing that a daily was made posfcible
at Stanford. At present it is priuted
uuder coutract with the business man
ager of the paper, who is responsible to
gether with the editor-in-chief for its
financial success
The Daily Palo Alto is authorized
by the Associated Students, who elect a
board of eight whose duty it is to name
the editor-in chief and business mana
ger, wi'h the advice of a faculty repre
sentative.
The editor-in-chief, who holds office
for one semester, appoiuts the editorial
staff; the business manager, holding
office lor one year has entire control ot
his department. Uoth editor and busi
ness manager are responsible to the
Hoard of Control for the proper direc
tion and good behavior of the paper
