The Stanford University Laundry.
This laundry was erected by Senator
Stanford for the convenience of those
living on the estate, and in order to
furnish a ready place for the laundry
work of i he students. The laundry
which is a two story building thirty by
seventy feet, isjfitted in the most modem
way with a complete steam plant, and
can turn out the very best class of
work. These premises have been
leased from the business manager of
the University property to »J. ft. Mc-
Gown. This gentleman's partner in
the new enterprise is II. T Emery
secretary of the Merchants' ftxchange
Association of Sao Ftancisco. Mr.

McGown is an active manager and has
operated the lauudry since Aug. 1,
1894 The lessees made many improve
ments upon the regular plant and can
now boast ot having an equipment
which leaves nothing to be desired.
The starched work is all done by
hand and fine work such as silks and
flannels are treated separately; special
care will be bestowed on sweaters and
other work requiring extra supervision.
Mr. J. P. Messenger, an experienced
and expert laundry man, is foreman and
has uuder him at the present time ten
competent assistants. It is the desire
of the management to employ student
labor whenever possible,and they will be
given the preference Just now several
are already employed, having good
places, very remunerative and which do
not seriously interfere with their Uni
versity work.
The manager on the campus is C. I'.
Snyd<r, '90, who will have geueral
supervision of the work from the cam
pus, while a special ageut lia> been ap
pointed for Kncina Hall in tlx; person

well known to every student who at
tended the University during its firs'
and second years of life, that the man
agement of the laundry think that they
have been especially fortunate in secur

to be supported by every student who
can in any possible way do so. Its
buildings are on the grounds and in
many ways it will be mote convenient
