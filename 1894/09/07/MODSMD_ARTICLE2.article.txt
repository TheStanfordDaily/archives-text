# The 						Dormitories.
## 
### 
fhis is the secoud year of the student
management of Ruble and Enema Halls.
These dormitories are leased by a faculty
committee from the business manager
of the University property, and are
again leased from this faculty committee
by a student, committe of three. Each
member of this committee is chosen by
the faculty from a list of five elected bv
the members of the boarding clubs, and
holds office lor one year, the terms of
the members expiring at different times
so that the committee is never wholly
replaced. The present members are
F. L. Entier, '96. chairman; It. L.
Gilliam,'96; and Miss E'sie Shelley, gr.
The chairman is under bonds to the
faculty committee to the amount of
$6000. The routine business of the
office is in the hands of Mr J. B.
Wootten, who is also treasurer and gives
$3000 bouds to the student committee.
The treasurer cannot be a student for
obvious reasons, and is responsible only
to the hall committee. The steward,
Mr Otto E Never, has charge of the
dining rooms and buys all supplies for
both halls, with consent and approval
of the committee The satisfaction
given t>) the steward hist year is a guar
antee that every effort, will be made by
him this vear to make the halls the
most pleasant place to stay. ilis aim
is to make the table as good as the
rooms are desirable The service will
be better this year, due to an increase
in the number ot professional waiters.
Many additions ana improvements have
been made in the kitchen under his
direction and at the expense of the
hoarding club. Any complaints about
board should be made to the committee,
and those about rooms or furniture to
(j. Adderson, the representative in thi#
matter of the business manager of the
I diversity.
A laundry has offered to take the
work of the halls at thirty per cent re
duction if the students make arrange
ments to collect and deliver it This
was the lowest bid and has been ac
cepted by a committee appointed for the
purpose II N. DeWolf, '97, has

charge of this business at the expense
of the club.
Payments for board and room
should be made, as far as possible,
in cash or by certified check; for the
first month the price is twenty-three
dollars, which will in all likelihood be
made twentv-one after this month.
