# '95’s Annual.
## 
### 
The "Stanford Quad" has been so
thoroughly read and as often written
about tha» anything further might.seem
superfluous were it not for the fact that
the book itself did not appear uutii too
late for reviewing in these eolumus.
Here is a notable production—a col
lege annual that is essentially an art
production, whose every detail is artistic
and which will compare well with any
of its kind It may not be too much to
say that from the standpoint of art this
annual heads the list of college annuals
for the jear. tSucb hat been the judg
ment of meu from Yale and other col
leges, and we think it will hold Fry,
'95, who had charge ol the art depart
ment, and Ely, '96, did most, of the art
work, and to them is due much of the
credit. The cover, designed by Mr.
Ely, attracted general attention.
In literature the annual represents
the University. None of the work is
pretentious, as no attempt was made to
make the department unique but the
contributions as a whole are decidedly
good. Most of the contributors re
ceived as a signature only their initials,
while they merited much fuller credit
It would seem th.it il for no other rea
son than for purposes of refereuce in
after years the full signature might
have been affixed in each Ci.se.
The department, of "Grinds" is good,
and especially the "Kodaks " Nruie
very happy hits were made upon the
vulnerable, but some of them seemed
almost malicious in their satire. This
was more particularly true as regards
the "grinds" upon the ladies. The
shaft that would scarcely .sting a man
quite often crushes a woman She has
no means of defense, no way in which
to retaliate, can not laugh off a wound
as can a man.
As regards statisties, Univeasity and
class history, and such reference mi iter
ial, the '95 annual has h id neater diffi
culties with which to contend that any
succeeding aunual will have; It has
had to cover a period of three yeans,
aud this too from very in,<dei|iinre news
paper record. h has had no traditions
to guide it, has inherited no standards
of excellence. lis sueei ss has he« n the
greater from the ohs'aeles which ii. has
ovcreoine It is woiny of the class
and I he Univer»i*v.
