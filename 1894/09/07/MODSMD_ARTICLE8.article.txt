With the pleasure of re-union come*
the saddening thought that one vacant
place has been made in our club of
twelve. Our dead friend ever had our
warmest sympathies, and the promise of
his life just merging into manhood,
tilled many of us with desire to be like
him. With every plan formed for the
coming year the tinge ot sadness deepens
into sorrow when it is remembered that
he can work with us no unre. As the
most intimate with Horace Leadbetter
in his Univerbity work, we wish to ex
press our sincere sorrow for the loss of
a pure and noble fellow, and to extend
to his family in their deep sorrow the
sympathy of those here who most feel
his loss. George Stratton,
Shirley Maker,
Robert Donald,
