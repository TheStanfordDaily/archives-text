# The
						Northern Baseball Trip.

### 
In view of the remarks and gossip
over the northern tour a few items will
be published relative to it, even at the
riisk of publishing stale news. During
June and July, Oeattle, Port Towusend,
Victoria, Tacoma, Spokane, Portland,
Astoria were visited and twenty-two
â€¢rallies were played; three of these
were lost and one was a tie. The scores
show close work. Of ten games won
the scores were, 10-9, 9-8, 8-7, 7-6,2 8.
Of those lost, the two played in Seattle
indicate the strength of our team, the
scores of which were 5 3 and 9-8.
Charges of corrupt umpiring are made
over the games lost; but whether this
only indicates the suspicion common to
disappointment or is partly true is of
no concern at this late day With ref
ereuce to the charges that have been
freely made our team, and were
made public in the 'limes,
whose editor is C. \j Clematis, gradu
ate student here in '92 and '93, noth
ing can be precisely stated. It appears
that while much of the scandal that has
appeared in the papers of the North is
unfortunate, tending to render Stan
ford notorious rather than respected,
the greater part of the newspaper talk
can be referred to the men of question
able character with whom every ath
letic team must come in contact, owing
to the sporting nature of their tour and
the publicity of their actions. The
geutlemen of the North speak in high
terms of the personnel of the team,
while those endeavored to eorrupt
the team refer to it in terms to be ex
pected from men of expedients and
questionable motives The whole mat
ter is being sifted by Dr. Antiell, the
chairman of the faculty committee on
athletics, and will be made public in m
few days.
