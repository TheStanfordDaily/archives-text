evening was a talk by Dr Jordan who
also read a letter of interest to all ana
which is published today, together with
a lew extracts from the president's talk.
Shirley Raker sang two of his raking
Hongs and materially helped tn remov
ing the stiffness from the affair.
Dr. Jordan's talk
Fellow-students, new students and
old—Some time ajjo L was talking with
Mrs. Stanford about the University,
and she said she would be glad when
the students all came back again, be
cause when they are here, there is some
sort of reason for the University beino,
and when they are not here it seems as
though Stanford University never was,
as though the summer liar were really
saying something. Hut when they are
here there is no question what the
University stands for."
We are glad to see so many students
here, not because a university is meas
ured by its numbers, but by its work,
and because it is a pleasure to see those
young men and women of California
who are tit to to college, kiiow a lie
when they see it.
1 have felt more perhaps than any
tiling else the larger attendance we are
having in this year of financial hard
ship It is u t so much the various
things that have been said about t he
University since its opening, but the
definite knowledge that these students
have of it, that has done the most good
It is a place to which the student is
eager to return, and they have, in this
large attendance, uiven us a testimonial
of their appreciation of the fitness ol
the University
In one of the coming Tuesday < veil
ing lectures, I shall uive you a detailed
account of the happenings of tin; sum
mer in po far as they a flee red the Uni
versity. I want every student to know,
and know thoroughly, just what the
University has gone through. When
the whole story is known, it will be one
of the most memorable facts in the his
tory of California. I want you to ap
preciate the fact that the University
will never close its doors because ot
the devotion of its surviving founder,
aod bccame of the work which is being
done here
Th ose peo| 1! who started the lies in
the stiiiimcr can never face the com
bined efforts of the students when they
.are assembled here in the winter
I wish to read you a personal letter
from Senator lloar of Massachusetts,
who has bean one of the friends of the
University and who was a friend of
Senator Stanford Perhaps no man in
Congress is better pasted on the whole
history of this University than Senator
Uoar:
United Status Senate, [
Washington, I) C ,June 28, 18!)4 \
My Dear Sir: I have your letter
of June 22 1 shall be very glad in
deed if my expression of opinion shall
in any way tend to dispel the cloud i
which over your University.
There is in the Senate a very general
agreement with me on the subject,
but a go >d many men dislike to offend
the prevalent Populistic spirit that is
abroad by uttering in public what they
think.

thought that the moneys and bonds
which have been divided among the
stockholders to be returned of
the treasurey of the Company and made
liable tor its debts, iDeluding the tdebt of
the United States. I drafted a bill having
that object, which passed Congress. Hut
the Supreme Court of the United States
held that it could not constitutionally
be done.
The case of the Central Pacific Kail
road cannot be as strong as that against
the Union Pacific Railroad because the
latter was incorporated by the United
State-, and the former is a State corpor
ation S<> the remedy, if any, against
the Central Pacific Railroad and its
8 oc'iholJers must be sought under the
laws of California. Now I understand
the Supreme Court, of California has
decided that the remedy against the
Central Pacific stockholders expired
three years after the debt was con
tracted. So vou have the judgment of
both courts—the Supreme Court of the
United States and that of the State of
California—holding in substance that
• here is no remedy for the Government
against these individual gtrckholders.
It. seems to me therefore a great
shame after these decisions, when the
Crocker and Hopkins estates have been
lon-; settled, to rake up a pretense and
shadow ot a demand that cannot have
any substance in it, thirty years after it.
originated, fciinply to harass your Uni
versity and render more difficult the
complete execution of Mr. and Mrs.
Stanford's beneticient project for the
education of the children of the people.
I think the people, both in California
and throughout the country, will see
this and will discourage anything which
