At the Executive Committee meet
ing tomorrow the question of collecting
the student body assessment will he
discussed. The delay until October of
the return of the treasurer elected last
spring, makes it necessary to take im
mediate steps to secure the collection of
the assessment; the fund thus obtained
bjing the only one at present upon
which the football manager can draw
for current expenses. Three alterna
tives seem to present themselves to the
committee; first, to appoint a temporary
treasurer; second, to ratify the nomin
ations made by the absent treasurer, of
several students who were to act as col
lectors; or third, to elect another treas
urer. The first of these alternatives
seems to be the one open to least objec
tion, and which will secure the rapid
collection of the amount. In the mean
time, no one should refuse to pay on
account of the questions raised. They
are merely ones of the constitutionality
of u student holding office and not reg
istered in the University at the time.
