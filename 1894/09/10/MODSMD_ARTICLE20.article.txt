For the benefit of new students we
make a few general statemejts concern
ing the Cooperative Association
This Association is incorporated un
der the laws of California, with a cap
ital stock divided into shares valued at
$2.50 each. Any student may become
a member by purchasing one share of
stock. Shares are transferable by prop
er endorsment and the payment of ten
cents to the manager for making a rec
ord of the transfer 011 the books of the
Association. It is thus often possible
to secure a share at reduced rates from
some member about to leave who is de
sirous of selling. Membership in the
Association < ntitles one to special rates
on all articles purchased; there are also
discounts which a member receives
when purchasing goods at certain stores
with which the Co-op has some agree
ment. All non-members are charged
regular retail rates for everything. If
a student anticipates an extended resi
dence here, or would be likely to pur
chase many books, he can make no
more judicious investment than the pur
chase of a share of stock in the Associ
tion.
