# The
						Rush.

### 
The signstrF the times have changed,
'97 no longer adorns the campus tank,
The number has been changed to 98
which signifies that the first rush of
the year has been won by the freshman
class. During Friday night some
member of the class converted the fig
ures, 97, on the tank into '98, and an
attempt on the part of the sophomores
to restore their sign Saturday afternoon
precipitated a royal battle. '97 was
outnumbered, but not enough to render
the rush a very uneven affair. lioth
sides fought with centipedian energy
in.spite of the heat; the sight was both
amusing and exciting to the many spec
tators assembled. Buckets of water
were poured from the top of the tank
upon those beneath. Two combatants
daubing each other with red paint pro
voked roars of laughter. A sophomore
and a freshman struggling fora foot
hold upou the very top of the tank, a
fall from which would have been ex
tremely dangerous to life and limb,
savored of battle in deadly earnest.
But no one was seriously injured. At
the end of an hour every sophomore
was tied up, and the banner of '97 was
trailed in the dust. Then the kodak
got in its deadly work, after which sev
eral of the prisoners were treated to a
"bus ride." The cowd then dispersed,
and the first rush of the year was over.
