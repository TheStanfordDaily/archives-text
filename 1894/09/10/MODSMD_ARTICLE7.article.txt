# Sunday Sermon.

### 
Rev. Mr. Thoburti preached the ser
mon in the chapel Sunday morning.
Mrs. Stanford was present at the ser
vice. Following is a synopsis of the
sermon.
'•For this cause came I into the world:
that I should bear witness unto the
truth." I don't believe that falsehood
can long be triumphant. Truth is
God's way of running things. Nature
permits mimicry, but she always exacts
a penalty. If man pretends to be good
when he is false, his falsehood soon
leaks through his false face. The best
way to be a christian is to be a good
man. Follow the highest impulses and
be true to the best, you know. True
men and womeu are not actors, but
livers. In every man is born the fire
of his own individuality, and all the
things we t:et here in the lecture rooms
are only food to feed this intellectual
i»y-
Among the summer lies about our
University is this, that we have no re
ligion at Stanford If religion means
the substitution of one man's though' for
all; or acting according to precedent, or
acting at a'l, then I hope our critics
are right. Hut if it means the out
reaching of every soul towaids its own
God. or the fidelity of every one to the
truth he sees; if it. means the earnest
effort of every one to live his best, then
I pray that these halls and eorriders
may be filled with that kind of religion
In this atmosphere of study and truth
fulness, your point of view will change;
you will see things differently after the
year hasended. Yourdanger lies in false
witnessing—in not being true to the
best thing you know. If you have a
valuable opinion, do not keep silent.
Show me the irreatest. truth you know
and I will show you your tethering
rnpe. To try to be true is to lead a
a life i.f struggle: tinth always lead* to
the cross
