# A 						Study in Statistics.
## 
### 
Many professors and teachers will
find much of interest in a study of the
following figures. They indicate the de
mand and supply of preparation for
University work. Unquestionably many
of the items indicate idiosyncrasies in
our own departments, those giving the
smallest percentage above sere especially
so. It still remains evident, however,
that the preparation given by the
schools for scientific study is inadequate
Those figures, in two cases, which show
that none passed the examination, are
explained by the probability that those
who attempted them were trying to get
advanced standing, and had in all likli
hood prepared without assistance. The
number given as having taken the ex
amination in any given case only reg
isters the number who handed in their
papers, and docs not take any notice of
the large numbers who did not hand hi
their attempts.
