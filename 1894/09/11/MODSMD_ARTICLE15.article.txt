The sermon of last, Sunday seems
deserving rif special mention because ot
itw recognition and clear presentation
of the religious influence and spirit ol
the University.
Such a statement cannot but beofgreat
value both in, placing us before the pub
lic in our own true light, and also to
new students, leaving home perhaps for
the tirst time, and whose sudden transi
tion to the atmosphere of our Univer
-itj, where "the winds of freedom blow, 1
wou'd tend at fir.»t rather toward execs
mvc reaction than healthy develop
ineut. We give the following (juata
thn from Prof. Thoburn s sermon;
They Si<y that we have no religion al
Stanford, if re I in ion meats servih
.subordination to custom aid .form, thr
substitution of any man's th >u«ht or tht
thought of any council or convention
for individual thought, if it una is act
ing at all, I hope our critics are right
tint if it means the outreach <112 ever)
soul toward its own fiod, the fidelity
of every one to his own creed, to tht
truth as he sees it, if it means the
earnest agonizing effort ot every one tc

live his best, then I ]T'iy that these
corridors and halls may be lull of it.
Euierson Bays: (lod offers to every
mind its choice between truth and re
pose. He can have oue, not both. He
who chooses repose accepts the first
creed, the first philosophy, the first pol
itical party that offers, most likely that
of his father. He get# rest but looses
his individuality; but he who chooses
truth keeps aloof from all moorings, his
auchor up, afloat. He abstains from
dogmatism; he is willing to endure sus
pense, to hold an imperfect opinion; but
he is open to the truth, he has not been
gradua e I, he cm always be led.
