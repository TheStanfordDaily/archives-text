the benefit of the new students, and
some of the old ones too, it. might be
stated that $96 is needed to place the
reading room in proper condition

Every old member of the boarding
club ought to feel proud of the reading
room of last year; all should take an
interest in pushing it yet more success
fully this year. The assessment of fifty
cents was authorized by the boarding
club when it accented the report of the
committee on the reading room last
semester There is now in the treas
ury a balance of one dollar and ninety
conts from last year; twenty dollars and
fifty cents have been collected on the
present assessment. This is a poor
time for assessments but in such a cause
none should ever hesitate to pay.
