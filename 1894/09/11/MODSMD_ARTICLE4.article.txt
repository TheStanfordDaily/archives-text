## 
### 
At the end of last year the Haziness
Offi -e of the University was paid
8583 15 for missing furniture in the
two halls. The guarantee 112 und amounted
to only $401, all of which was thus ex
pended, and #182.15 of the surplus
funds of the boarding club beside The
little surplus of $238.50 saved to com
mence the new year was by this reduced
to $~j6.35.
Rrieflv summarized the list was: â€”

Glass 3 92
Tablecloths 10 00
China 9 19
Room furniture 15 00
Roble total 8 49 54
Total for both halls 8 583 15
Considering tde number of guests in
Kncina and Roble, $249.19 does not
represent an unreasonable amount for
a year's wear and tear. But the $334
for damage to Kncina rooms can hardly
find a defender. Thirty-four destinct
articles of damaged furnature form this
total. The largest are:
Stationary wash stands $ 55 00
Gas globes 33 00
Scarlet blankets 65 00
Feather pillows 24 00
A great many blankets and pillows
disappeared wholly.
This year's guarantee fund is at Kn
cina $1.50 at Roble fifty cents each.
The diheriminatiou is nut without rea
