# The
						Faculty Athletic Committee and Its Relation to the Student Body.
## 
### 
The exact relation existing between
the Faculty Athletic Committee and
the athletic teams of the University has
not been clearly understood Some
have expressed surprise at the authority
exercised by the committee, and accord
ingly Dr. Angell, the chairman, was
seen a day or so ago in reference to the
matter.
The committee, like all other faculty
committees, is app ointed by Dr. Jordan,
and has a general supervision of athletic
matters. Dr. Angell says that its policy
has been to lot the students run their
own affairs to suit themselves, and the
committee has very seldom interfered
with any action ol the Athletic Hoard.
The committee has seen fir, rather to
suggest and advise than to legislate, al
though the whole conduct of athletic
affairs is entirely in its hands. It does
not propose, however, to rule the ath
letic interests with an iron rod, although
some things—notably the financial man
agement of the football and baseball
teams —have been far from satisfactory
Some one must see to it that the good
name of the University is upheld in
athletic matters, and this the committee
proposes to do by putting out objection
able men, by demanding thatall partici
pating in intcr-collegiatc contests, and
especially the athletic managers, be
bona fide students, and by insisting on
teams using the University name acquit
ting themselves like gentlemen.
Such has been t'ie dissatisfaction of
not only the committee but of a large
number of other professors in regard to
the financial management of .'uc teams
that, as one professor expressed if, ''We
are desirous of contributing to the sup
port of the football team, but we must
positively refuse to do so until the fi
nances are put upon a proper basis."
This is but an echo of the sentiment of
the student body, arid it is to be hoped
that this year will sec a marked change
in the financial management of the team.
