Editor I>aily Palo Alto:
In glancing over the Guarantee Fund
balance sheet for last year, several
tilings appeared to need some explana
tion. Through jour columns 1 would
like to have the reason made clear, why
the Ruble fund was made to bear more
than its just slrire of the charges for
damage. The i'uud of each hall is en
tirely independent of the boarding club
management, and apparently a joint
stock agreement to defray the expenses
for broken furniture is unfair to the
girls concerned.
A<:ain, many of the items charged to
the fund are due to individual careless
ness. As I understood the fund, its
object was to provide for wear and tear,
and as the receipt yiven on payment of
fund dues clearly states, " All injuries
to University property not chargeable
to individuals are to be paid lor lrom
this fund." Such items as broken
marble wash stands, lost blankets, and
strayed pillows are essentially chargeable
to individuals. That the general fund
should be made to pay such charges as
these, and make up for lax supervision
on the part of the representative of the
business office, seems unjust.
