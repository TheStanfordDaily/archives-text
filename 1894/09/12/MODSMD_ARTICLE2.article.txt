# Professor Anderson's Lecture on "Matthew Arnold."
## 
### 
"When I was a professor at Illinois
College some years ago, the question
came up among the students whether
Mr. Arnold or Mr. Talmadge should be
selected as one of the lecturers before
the Educational Society that year. I
pleaded for Mr. Arnold successfully.
There were only a few of us who en
joyed the lecture. The comments upon
it in the local papers were very severe.
This is not strange since in his lifetime
few understood or appreciated him.
"Matthew Arnold's sweetness was a
geuuiaeand personal quality. He was
a wonderfully kind-hearted, benevolent,
oheerful gontleman, who wanted to do
a good turn for the whole human race.
It was hie aim to constitute himsolf a
court of disin' ted review mid correc
tion. lie c of the few who, see
ing th uitigs of his country
r '»g t () rc*st in half-way
id of becoming a pub

lieist and advocating some special and
minute reform, he made himself critic
of the social, business), and religious
life of his time, and preached with un
failing courage and tact a gospel that
seemed enormously absurd to those to
whom it was addressed.
Matthew Arnold preached culture.
Culture i«i the means out. of our present
difficulties, by getting to know the best
which has been thought and said in the
world, turning a stream of fresh and
free thought upon our stock notions and
habits. Culture has not its origin in
curiosity, but has iis origin in the
love of perfection. The first motive
which to impel us to study is the
desire to augment the excellence of our
being. Hut there is no selfishness in
it. In the words of Losing, ' Not the
truth, in possession of which man is,
hut the sincere pains he lias taken to
get at the truth, makes worthy man.
For not by possession, hut by investi
gation of thu truth comes the expansion
of his powers."
