# Students Guild.
## 
### 
Kefore the lecture last evening Prof.
Griffin said a lew words about the Stu
dents' Guild. It was organized last
year to assist students who were sud
denly taken ill upon the campus, with
out possessing at the moment the means
or the friends to help them.
The guild last semester had done
much in a modest way. Last summer a
deserving student, endeavoring to work
upon a ranch in Clara Valley,
had become dangerously ill. He was
taken to a sanitarium where he lay
ill fora month.
Professor Griffin requested the stu
dents to cotne to the aid of the guild.
A voluntary collection was taken,
amounting to $28.25.
This is the first time that money has
ever been collected in the chapel.
It is eminently fitting that a precedent
should be broken and established in
such a good cause.
