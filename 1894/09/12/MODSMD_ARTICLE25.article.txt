# The
						Law Reading Room.
## 
### 
The law library lias been removed to
room 31, Encina. Mr. G. M. Hughes
'94, is in charge, and will keep the
library open to law, economics, and
history students from 8 till 10:30 o'clock
every day. Volumes arc replaced at
once in their proper position upon the
shelves, and none can be taken from
the room without the custodian's assent.
Encina law students are greatly con
venienced by this change, especially as
room 31 is one of the largest and most
pleasant in Encina, having four windows
and a southern outlook.
