A Stanford Scientific Party in Arizona.
This September a number of Stanford
students returned from a six months
Bfcay in Arizona. They collected several
thousand specimens of birds and
small animals, with n number of deer,
elk. and bear, besides making numerous
and valuable notes on their distribution,
migration, and general habits. The
White Mountains, in the north of the
Territory, and the Chirachua Range
alon<; the southern border, were the
principal hunting grounds of the party.
U. C Condit, '00, made a 400-mile trip
into Old Mexico. Most of the time was
passed in an altitude of from S,OOO to
10.COO feet. On this account the party
was not much troubled by Indians, even
when in the Apache land. Most of the
travel was done on foot, burros being
used for carrying the baggage.
Some of the specimens are now beinjj
studied by specialists in the Smithson
ian Institute at Washington. Both
the animals and notes taken add greatly
to the scientific knowledge of the re
gion, while the successful conduct ol
the expedition reflects much credit
upon those engaged in it.
W. W. Price, '90, H. (J. Condit, '90,
W. A. Prichard, 98, W 11. Miller,
'98, and Malcolm Anderson composed
the field party.
