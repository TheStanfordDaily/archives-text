Football practice in both Berke

way before many days have passed,
and the improbability of another tit
game, together with the thought

will tend to make the victory ours
I'r.e coming 1 hinksgiving game will
uudoub«dly be of more than usual
interest. The large ciowds attend
ing the practice games and the in
terest shown in them already indicate
this. On the night of November
'2!) th Stan Old will be either tri
umphant or defeated. We f^el con
fideut that the coach and the eleveu
will do all in their power to bring
wbout the formtr result, but there is
another factor to be taken into con
sideration. 'Ibis factor is the stu
dents themselves.
Last year up to the day of the
game, little or no attention was
paid to th« help which the students
can give the team. This year there
is hope that some change will be
made. The assistance that the stu
dents can give the team is in partici
pating in well-organized, systematic
cheering. At Princeton, Jlatvard,
mid Yale systematic cheering is con j
sidered as an tqual factor with the j
team in winning a game, and conse
quently great attention is pai.l to j
the proper training ot the students:
:n the matter of cheering at the
right lime, with proper vim. and at
hll timtfl systematical y. Leaders
are selected, and these men conduct
t lie cheeiing as a director would an
orchestia. Interest is never allowed
to lag. < beer after cluer inspires
the team when it is being hadi
pushed. Encourage un nt is not
needed when the team has made a
tine play. A dead silence is almost
fatal when ti e team is worn out and j
discouraged. Proper cheering in-;
hpires the team as nothing else will,
and causes a struggle that may save j
the duy.
A moments thought will convince,

1 anyone of the importance of system
atic cheeriug. We need it and we
must have it, now that we are to
play oil' that tie, and someone —prob-
ably the football manager would be
the best per.-on —should take the
I matter in hand at once. Competent
; persons should be selected to lead
J the cheering every afternoon at prac
tice. New and witty yells can easily
be composed ,by our poets. Large
crowds will gather at the oval as a
result, and enthusiasm will be at
fcv< r heat.
We mut-t not wait until the last
few weeks to work up enthusiasm.
ow is the time to begin and then
if we are beaten it will not be be
cause we did not do our parts, but
because Berkeley deserv d to wiu.
