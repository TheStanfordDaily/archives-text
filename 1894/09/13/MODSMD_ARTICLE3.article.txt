# The
						First Practice.
## 
### 
The nucleus of the football
team of last year lined tip no
the ovul last evening lor the first
time. The play was short, yet
long enough to show that the spirit
was not. wanting that is essential for
victory. It is greatly to he deplored,
however, that the last year'sjplayers arc
4iot responding as quickly; to the call
flf our captain as they should To
make the team successful, practice, long
and hard, is needed. No one should
want to be personally summoned.
This appeal is especially to our new
students. There is a chance lor every
one who has the vim and the pluck to
ooutpete. Only eighteen men lined up.

Code, Cochran, and C. Downing of last
year's Varsity and Thomas, Williams,
Fickert, Rice, Spalding, and Reynolds
of the old second team were on hand.
The Reynolds hoys, Jack and Harry,
played half-backs for the first team,
both making a number of very pretty
runs. Among the new men, Cotton
and Wells made the best showing.
