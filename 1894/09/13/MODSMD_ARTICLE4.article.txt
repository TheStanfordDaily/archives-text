A few of the library rules are of
sufficient importance to bear reproduc
tion here, si' ee failure to observe them
is (lie cause of much inconvenience:
Students should return all hooks to
the places from which they are obtained.
The library is not a circuiting one,
and no book should be taken out of the
building.
No loud talking is allowable in the
library.
In copying from books or plates,
readers are requested not to use ink.
Access to the shelves is accorded to
graduates; undergraduates doing semin
ary or other special work are admitted
to any particular part of the library,
upon the written recommendation of the
professor under whose direction the
work is being done.
