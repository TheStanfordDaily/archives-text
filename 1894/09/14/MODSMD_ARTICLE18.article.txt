The freshman class at Vale, or Har
vard, or Princeton, always contains
material in abundance for immediate
development on the football field, he
cause of the more or less previous train
ing of that material in the many
schools preparing for those collages
II u man have the making of a player
in him, he himself knows it before his
college matriculation; and when he ar
rives at the university he finds that
football enthusiasts there are quite as
well acquainted with his records and
prospects as he. On entering he is
made to understand what is expected of
him, and goes at once into training.
Thus little time is lost in getting the
candidates into practical work.
At this University it is different.
Comparatively few of our students enter
from preparatory schools where football
is played, and even when from those
few schools they are mostly innocent
of the genuine football fever. This
makes it necessary to find and develop
Our own material. Men of the riht
physique, men who may never have
fceen a scrimmage, must he interested in
the game and got into training. En
thusiasm must be kindled. The honor,
the pleasure, the manliness of the game
must be appealed to. Then comes the
long and conscientious work of the
coach, tho hard field work, the grand
team-work, and the great game on
Thanksgiving day with its triumphs
and glory.
Stanford was proud of her football
team last year, and rightly; she fully
believes in the one which shall repre
sent her this year; and yet no loyal stud
ent can overlook the fact tnat tho next
team, to win, niußt be the best that nan
be got together. We have not shown
ourselves so strong that we can afford
to lie back on our oars and drilt for even
a single season. Some of our best

placers graduated lust year; others will
not return to the University. Such
vacancies must be filled from the very
best men in the freshman clas», or we
shall he weaker than we can afford. It
remains with the new men to uphold
the honor of their college. After the
Thanksgiving game shall have been won
or lost it will be too late for them to
grow enthusiastic. They must respond
uow.
