# The 						Football Practice.

### 
A large crowd witnessed the second
practice game of the season lust night.
In spite of the number of spectators,
however, enthusiasm was uoticeab'y
lacking. There were about eighteen
players lined up, and, as in the evening
before, they played with vim Dole, a
new man, played well at center on the
Hecond eleven. Harry and Jack Rey
nolds are showing up well as backs.
Their chief fault is running too high
with the ball, hut practice will remedy
this. It is an excellent idea to have
two such experienced men as Franken
heimer and Sheehan, umpire and ref
eree each practiec game. Manager
Ilicks promises to have a supply of new
(suits next week, so the new men will
have no excuse for not appearing on
(he field.
