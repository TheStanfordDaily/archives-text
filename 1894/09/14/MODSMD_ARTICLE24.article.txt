There are at present 104 young ladies
in Roble and many applications have
been made which cannot be satisfied.
A meeting of the Women's Athletic
Association will he held in Roble Gym-
nasium on Monday, Sept. 17, 1894.
Officers will be elected fur this semes
ter.
Hereafter four students will occupy
the rooms in the east end of the boat
house at Lauunita. Their presence
will stop much of the vandalism which
was so annoying last year to members
of the Boat Club.
Regular meetings of the Seminary in
Economics have been postponed until
next semester, owing to the crowded
condition of the classes and the in-
creased work thereby devolving upon
Profs. Warner and Ross. Thesis work,
however, will be required of those reg
istered for the course, as original y out
lined for them.
