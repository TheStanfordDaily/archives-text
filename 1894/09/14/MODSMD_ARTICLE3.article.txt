# Summer Work at the Hopkins Laboratory.
## 
### 
Both instructors and students who
did work at the Hopkins Seaside Lib
oratory this summer, report a most suc
cessful and profitable season ol* study
The capacity and accommodations of
the laboratory were greatly increased
by the completion, early in the summer,
of a fine two-story building, admirably
adapted to the work. It contains a
general lecture room and library, u lab
oratory, fourteen private rooms for in
vestigators, and a dark room for photo
graphic work Large public aquaria
will be placed in the basement. The
good system of plumbing with which
the building is provided is a novel feat
ure. All of the pipes are of pure
block tin, with faucets of aluminum, so
that water passing through them can
not become tainted or impure. The
building was erected by .Mr. Timothy
Hopkins and adds materially to there
eources of the laboratory.
