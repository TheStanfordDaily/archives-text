# The 						Co-op. Lawsuit.
## 
### 
On Wednesday last the manager of
the Co-op. had pipers served on him to
answer to a claim brought against the
Co-op. by an attorney in San Francisco,
who is assignee of an account, of .1 ,J.
I'fi-ter Knitting Co ffic 101l i< alleged

to be due for nearly two years. The
directors < 112 iho Co-op ,at a inciting
Thursday, took definite steps to fight
the account, believing tha' there lias
never been any just claim against the
Co-op. which has not been cheerfully
and duly paid.
This is not the first time that claims
have arisen against tlu Co-op. which
have been difficult of settlement, but it
is the first time that any account has
gone into the courts. It is not, to say
the least, judicious on the part of the
Company to turn over to a collection
agency an account against such an in
stitution sis the students' Co op , which
stands for the fulfillment, of all honest
obligations, and would willingly pay
this bili of $40 if it can be satisfactorily
shown that the bill is correct.
