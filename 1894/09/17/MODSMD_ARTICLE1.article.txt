The audieuce which greeted Alfred
Wilkie's aggregation of talent last Fri
day evening was enough to take the en
thusiasm out of any artist. There were
only about twenty-five people present.
Tho trios and duets were very well
rendered. The attacks and shading
might be especially mentioned. Mr
Wilkie' 's voice was not up to its usual
standard. The contralto, Miss Henri
etta Bayley, was enthu-iastically re
ceived j she sang with a clear, full,
resonant voice, and after singing an (<i)
and (I)) number was called upon for an
encore.
Miss Gruetihauren, the violinist,
seemed to be the most popular per
former of the evening. Her rendering
of Handel's Sonata i t A however lacked
soul ; the tempo was too slow and her
bowing was stiff and painfully studied
Her violin playing was the smallest
part of her performance.
Miss Lillian Goodman, the soprano,
selected for her solo ' The Maid of Ca
diz" by Delibes. The young lady was
somewhat nervous and did not do her
self justice; in singing Iter encore,
however, she became better acquainted
with the audience and her voice came
out clear as a bell on the higher notes.
Miss Goodman give* promise of being
an excellent singer some d;iy.
Mi. It. Fletcher Til ton, the pianist,
jumbled his notes all in a heap and
gave them to the andience bunched,
lie was down on the program for an
and (//) number, but in playing (<t) he
fractured his finger nail and could
not finish with (/j), The audience
did not seem to care very much, how
ever.
Taking it all in all, the concert was
fairly enjoyable, but hardly worth the
time and money required
