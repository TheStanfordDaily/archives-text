# Football on Saturday.
## 
### 
The luek of enthusiasm among the
players was sadly noticeable Saturday.
Very few men were out and they did
not line up Berkeley iÂ» already com
menting on the happiness it will bring
to them if they defeat us, not only in
the Thanksgiving game, but are also
able to win the Freshman game to be
played December 8. In contrast to
this is our own inactivity, so evident to
all.
