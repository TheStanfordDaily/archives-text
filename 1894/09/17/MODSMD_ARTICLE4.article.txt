Yosemite." The debate, " Resolved,

as a means of improving the condition
of the working classes," was careful y
discussed and contested by IÂ£. D.

upheld the negative and affirmative

Three minute speeches were given
on the "Corean affair" by Johnson, '9(5;
"Tl ie relation of employer to employe,"
