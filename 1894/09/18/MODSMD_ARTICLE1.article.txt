						Lecture This Afternoon.

Mrs. Toomy lectured this afternoon
in the chapel to a small audience on
"Illiteracy of Speech " Mrs. Toomy
has been engaged in educational work
for many years, and has been identified
for some years with the Girls Public
School of San Francisco. The follow
ing are verbatim extracts from her
talk.
At every step in bis existence ti e
human being needs teaching, since
human helplessness would be very dis
couraging were it not for culture.
Man may become divine through edu
cation, and the progress of education is
one of the marvels of this age. 1 be
lieve that chi'd study here is doing an
incalculable amount, of good for the
Mate and the state should he thankful
to the University for it. Millions ol
hours are lost to every generation in
learning to spell English words.
It is a mark of promise not to spell
easily. Tlie whole process of English
spelling makes great numbers of child
ren forever hate the sight of books.
$15,000 000 yearly are paid out to
teachers to bemuddle the minds of our
children with English spelling. At
least $15,000,000 more are paid out to
jniliters for setting up silent letters.
1 don't wish to be underst- od as seek
ing to introduce a new subject, but
there is a remedy for almost everything
and 1 think we teachers should find a
remedy for this.
One remedy might be plainer speak
ing. Instead of saying "how do?'' when
we wish to say "how do you do?'' and
instead of leaving out the "d" in "good
morning," let us be correct in these
things, especially before children. We
might exercise our mouth muscles every
morning. We might practice prouounc
ins; our '*ds ' and our "fcs."
It is a deplorable tact that there is
little difference between the speech of
the college graduate and the butcher
boy, between the speech of the milli
ner's richest customer and the milliner's
maid. I believe I should refuse cer
tificates of graduation to those who
cannot speak plainly.
The lecturer concluded by remarking
that the tendency seemed to be in favor
of making the English language a uni
versal one.
