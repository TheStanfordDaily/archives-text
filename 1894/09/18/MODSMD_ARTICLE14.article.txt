The interest manifested in the
Senior Class meeting this afternoon
was wofully mild. Such a ondition
characterizes Stanford class elections
with perhaps two exceptions, viz..
the second semester of the junior
yeir of each claps, aud the sunn
semester in the senior year of the
class
The reason for this is apparent, as
it is only at these timos that any
considerable prominence is attached
to the principal offices of the class.
In the junior year occur Junior lay
and the junior hop, and the class
annual is produced; while in the
senior year come class day, the
senior hop, and the general distinc
tion arising from the mere fact that
one belongs to the last, body of offi
cers the class will elect.
It seems political wisdom, how
ever, and the idea has apparently
been overlooked, that candidates for

tlie prominent positions should side
track their opponents by electing
them for uuiinportant ternm.
As there is but one nominee lor
the presidency of '95 and for some
other positions, there is still oppor
tunity to nominate men for these
offices. Various candidates are per
haps already in the field for the
election of next semes er.
