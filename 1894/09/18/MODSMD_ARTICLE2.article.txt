# Glee and Mandolin Club Combination.
## 
### 
The mnnapers of the (ilee and Man
dolin Clubs have been considering (be
Â»<ivisibility of combining rbo two clubs,
nnd it is probiblc that this will be
brought to :i successful issue during
this week. The advantages to be de
rived from such a combination are quite
obvious. Neither club can give a very
creditable concert without the assist
ancoof the other, but with the com
bination the variety of talent insures a
successful concert and one creditable
to the University.
All the best talent in the (ilec Club
has returned or will return this year,
and the Mandolin (31 ub has not lost a
single member The ability of the

freshman class appears to be more than
usual, no the standards of both clubs
will undoubtedly be raised. Arrange
ment* are being made to go south dur
ing the Christinas vacation All the
principal towns will be visited, besides
a number of small ones. A concert is
now being planned to be given on the
campus in the near future by the com
bined clubs.
