Two full teams lined up yesterday
for the first time this year, and the
play was lively and more spirited than
usual. Punting was freely indulged in,
some good work in it being done by
Zion and De Wolf who acted as full
backs. The same fault in tackling,
however, was noticeable. It was much
too high, and a little inclined to be too
hard, i-onic clumsy work was notice
able, hut this will disappear when the
men get thoroughly acquainted with
their positions.
The second team was greatly ham
pered by the scarcity of heavy men, but
notwithstanding this showed up to good
advantage.
