# Our Water Supply
## 
### 
The water used about the campus for
irrigation and sprinkling purposes, and
that fluid which runs through Encina
and Ruble I lulls, comes from Searsville
Dam, six miles up in the mountains.
The supply from that quarter is inex
haustible, but the quality of the water
is not very good because of the depth
of the outlet, the mud, the organic
matter, an 1 the great number of carp
that burrow in the bottom. All the
drinking water consumed on tbe campus
is carted from the tank over by the
Row. This tank is kept filled from an
artesian well beneath it.
When seen this morning as to con
templated improvements in our water
supply, Dr. Jordan said that next year
probably one of two things would be
done: either a plant for the purification
of the Searsville water will be estab
lished here on the campus, so that the
water may be used both for irrigation
and drinking purposes; or wells will'he
sunk in the rear of the power houses,
where water can be obtained at a very
slight depth, and pumped from huge
storing tanks to every part of the
campus. This latter scheme will give
us the purer wa er, but whichever of
the two is the most feasible will be the
one put into operation. There is no
truth in the report that the Spring
Valley Water Co. is to supply the
University with water before long, for
if necessary the University can own
and control its own supply
