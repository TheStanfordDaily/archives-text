The question of a sewer system at
lÂ»ulo Alto having been agitated last
year, Messrs. A. W. Cuddebnck, '94,
and 11 l)rake, '94, students in civil
engineering bore last year, prepared
plans fur an elaborate wafer and sewer
aye system. These plaus were ox
plained by Prof, Marx to tli3 trustees
of the town at. a meeting held last
June. Since then the matter has been
at rest until this last week, when it
was again brought up for consideration.
Honds will probably be voted to provide
