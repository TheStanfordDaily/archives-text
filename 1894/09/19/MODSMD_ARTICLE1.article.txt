Readers of this paper may have
noticed that on Tuesday the 11 inst,
reference was made to the fact that a
professor had sent his paper back to
this office with ''declined" written npon
it j this item has been the cause of much
comment. Not only has the editor
been interviewed on the subject, but
communications have come to him from
different sources relative to it. In
order to make the reasons for its publi
cation clear, it may be said that the
first issue w is a complimentary one and
was sent to every person on the campus;
it, is needless to say that to decline it
was unnecessary. The main reason,
however, for its appearance is, that, all
students take great interest in the atti
tude of the faculty towards their enter
prises, the making known of such atti
tude forms the best kind of news item
and as such it, was published Notwith
standing this sufficient, reason for publi
cation it occurred to the management
that the professor to whom the item re
ferred might, read into it something un
intended, and with this thought iu mind
meditated an explanation. About, this
time the following note catne through
the mail
Sept. 1-1, 1804.
Editor Daily Palo Alio:
iSir:—Your recent surprising attempt
to m ike the Daily Palo Alto an eng
ine for the levying of blackmail, and
your further attempt in connection
with the matter to bribe with a year's
subscription a member of the English
department, make an apology due from
you to me. Will you please c;t 11 at.
my office at your earliest convenience.
Sincerely yours,
BOLTON C. Hit OWN'
To call the publication of a mere
news item •' blackmail " is obviously a
misnomer. The second charge is base
less and untrue. It is admitted on
second consideration that sentiments
may be lead into the item by old stu
dents and those who have been in touch
witii University life from the first year,
which were far from the mind of the
editor; and also that the wording used
is unfortunate. Fur these reasons it is
conceded that the above explanation is
due. Ed.
