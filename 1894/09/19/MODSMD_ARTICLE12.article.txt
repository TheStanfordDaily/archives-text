The 1) mocrats and Republicans
are intending to organize branch
clubs at S anferd. The action meets
with objections from some and com
mendation from others.
It is univeisally it cognized that
politic .I parties are necessary to the
existence of a state. 1 here must be
competitive thought a».tl competit.ve
action in political as in industrial
suciety. For the highest ideals of
government and the ino.-»t patriotic
expressions of the human will to be
realized, it is necessary that one
party, one creed, one jet of intel
lects—each working for the best
t' ere is in the world—should he op
posed to at hast one other.
One must belong to some party;
the iconoclast virtually amounts to
nothing because he accomplishes
nothing; and one must also Lam the
principles and ideals of tlie paity
whose cause he espouses. Wluere,
then, is a better place, if he is a col
lege student, than right in college?
Jiut it is argued that if we must
have parties let us have a non-par
tisan party —as if such a paradox
were possible A paity which was
lion-partisan, disregarding the ab
surdity of the proposition, would
not be the agent iti politics which a
true party is intended to be. It
would bo nothing more than a head
less, tadless, and brainless aggregu
tion, organized for political puiposes.
A liberal person will t-ay, let the
party organiz ttions go on in the
college; join the reform league if
you will, but join a party also and
carty your reformatory pr.nciples
with you. If you vole a party
ticket simply becau e your father
does or did, yt>u have wasted your
life and our benefactors' heque-ts.
Join a party club, read the literature
of the party, weigh the arguments in

your o\wi mind, and be prepared to
tuko a firm stand on definite
ground®.
