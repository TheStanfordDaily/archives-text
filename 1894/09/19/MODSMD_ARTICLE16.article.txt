A great deal of sati-factiou has been
expressed in Encina Hall this year
over the marked improvement in the
quality of food furnished. The steward
Mr. .Never is doing his best to keep
up the improvement, and as each addit
ional person comes iulo the hall it en
ables him to do something towards this
end. A noticeable and very welcome
improvement has lately come in the
way of clear water. Taking into con
sideration the electric llio large
comfortable rooms, stationary wash
stands, <;ood board, and excellent ser
vice Enciua Hall a ismost desir
able boarding place, and one perhaps
unexcelled by any college dormitory of
wliicli any record is at hand.
