Can you inform me wliy some of the
I Knciriu Hall guarantee fund is not ap-
I propriated to the purpose of keeping
i the ball piano in repair? It would
«eem that il tjll breakage of hall furni
ture, < to . is to be charged to this fund,
i t lie cost of tulli riix the piano once or
i twice a year should come from the
same source. The piano is as much a
part of the furnituic of the hall as are
the chairs or electric lights, and there
should he some provision for keeping
it, in condition for use. The present
condition of the piano is enough to dis
courage any musician, ]{, ,J. VV.
[The justice of making the guarantee
fund defray such an expense is obvious;
it is probable, however, that a piano
which discourages practice is the best
kind for Kccina Hall.—Ed ]
