" Not how long, but how well."
Some lamps are lit
To burn with long, slow light that dies
at last
And leaves the darkness scarce more
dark.
One lamp
Flamed out, burned bright, shed light,
which suddenly
Flickered and died: those who had
known the light
S-'id, " It is dark.''
A classmate gone;'
Familiar arches rise before our eyes
The same as yesterday when he was
here â€”
The same. One face is missing from
the throng,
One face we knew. Believe not those
who say
We are forgotten. The old world rolls
Oil,
The same old world as ever, yet one
place
Is empty, and, in memory held dear,
A classmate's gone. C.
