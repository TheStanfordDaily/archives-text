Tlic practice last night, as on the
night before, showed that tlie second
eleven is lacking in heavy men. The
Downing, 11 at relson, Jack Reynolds,
Spalding, and Cochran did good steady
work. The playing is still character
ized by h'gh tackling and running high
with the hull. Good punters are notice
ably lacking no team can amount to
much, especially under the present
rules unless if can boast of at least two
or three men who are proficient in this
line. There are several men who do fairly
well at kicking, but they lack practice.
It these men could devote an hour or
two a day to this alone, in a month they
would show a marked improvement, not
only in the length of the punt but in
the other elements so necessary
to successful punting, quickness
and the so-called "spiral" One evi
dence of growing enthusiasm hist night
was the college yell, given by a number
of men on the side lines. The specta
tors were generous also in their ap
plauseâ€”and this, properly bestowed,
will do a great deal towards the ulti
mate success of a team.
