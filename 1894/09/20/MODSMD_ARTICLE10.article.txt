# Miss Benfey's Reading.
## 
### 
The presence of an artist with us
Friday evening should call forth hearty
support on the part of the students.
Living as we do so far from the eastern
centres of culture, we are seldom favored
with a visit from one who ranks second
to none in her profession.
As a reader Miss Benf'ey has received
exceptional commendation from those
who have heard her and who are com
petent, to judge.
Dion Boueicault in a letter speaks of
her thus: "The public need not k;iow
that you brought into my school a
ready-made artist, and we could add
little to your sum of sweet qualities."
Kobert Collyer of New York, in
writing to her, says: "Your reading is
well worth the remembering long after
you cease to speak, which is a great
thing in a reader."
lliratu Corson, professor of English
literature in Cornell University, speaks
highly of her: "Iler impersonations of
the several characters showed great
histrionic capabilities."
The indications are that Miss Henley
will be g'eeted with a large audience
Friday evening, as the seats now on
sale in the postoffice, registrar's office,
and in the halls are going rapidly.
