To oi l students theie will be gen
uine pleasure to know that the Rev
Dr Slebbitiß will deliver the address
Sunday morning. The presence of
Dr, Stebbius is always a guarantee of
a Itttgeaudisnce; bis popularity with
us is well known.

It has been the complaint in for
mer years that talent of a high order
was rarely secured at t 1 e University,
The appearance of such an artist so
eirly in the ) ear as is to read in the
chapel on Friday evening, with the
prospect of otberenteriainments of an
equally high character, will tend to
di 'pel such an id-a

While tho ouergy of the pruolice
ou tbe oval is to be greatly com
mended, under present conditions
there is u danger in it The men
are not )et in that perfect physical
condition which admits of haul tack
ling. Two rather serious injuries so
early in the season cause us some
apprehension that we may ex)>eri
< the bad luck i i that direction
which fell to Berkeley lust year.

The notice in another column of
the possibility of getting the finest
orche-itra to cjino here, which has
visited the coas*, should make every
one having any influence, work to
achieve so desirable an end, Tli
(Ilee Cub is the body having most
authority in such a case as this, and
can make a success of the thing if it
tiikes the company in hand. No
time should be lost in making pre
liminary ai rang- ments.

Now tbit the name of tbe Berke
ley couch has been announced, there
isageueral feeling among the s.udents
that a similar announcement should
be made by our management.
Many 1 ave doubted the wisdom of
Mich a policy of secrecy; but cju
ceding tl at it has been advantageous
to our caune, it is diflieult to nee how
further silence can feive us, We
nee 1 to avoid tbe < xtremediplomacy
which, although it m iy upright
to us here in college, will tend :o
give us outside a reputation for du
plicity, In the city in particular we
cannot afford to lose any friends for
the sake of a whim.
