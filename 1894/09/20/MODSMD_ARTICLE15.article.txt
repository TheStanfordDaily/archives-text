# Athletic Club Meeting.
## 
### 
The meeting of the Athletic Club
held this afternoon in room 13 was a
very stormy though enthusiastic one.
There was a full attendance present and
the chief interest centered around the
election of a track captain. There were
three candidates for this position, Pave
Brown, '97, E. E. Farmer, '05 and
Bancroft, U5 each one having warm
supporters. The contest, which was a
spirited one throughout, finally resulted
on the election of Dave Brown to the
position by a vo'e of 3 to 5, with one
scattering.
