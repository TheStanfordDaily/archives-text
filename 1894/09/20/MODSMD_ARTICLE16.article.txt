# Football Practice.
## 
### 
The practice last night was by f<n
the best that has been seen on the ova!
this year. The play was spirited ami
full of vim. The tnen tackled hard and
low and fell on the hall without that
hesitation which lias so marred then
former play in this respect. Claude
D wiling and Jack Reynolds called
forth the praise oi the spectators time
after time by their splendid runs undei
the ii.terfereuce of Code and Paul
Downing.
The punting was exceedingly good
the returns quick and well placed
The ends, however, of both teams must
learn to get down more quickly on a
kick. The backs too, must learn to fill
the vacancies in the line when a line
men runs with the ball, thus giving tin
runner a fair chance to start..
The new players are earnestly ail
vised to master the rules ot the game as
quickly as possible It is especially de
-irable for them to know when the ball
is in play and what constitutes an ''oft
side."
Knowledge of these rules would make
game much easier both for the in
dividual player and the team-woik in
which ho must take part,
