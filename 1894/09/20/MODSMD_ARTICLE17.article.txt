In order to stimulate football enthu
siasm, bring out new men, and awaken
a general interest in the game, Mr.
J. J. Pfister, president of the J. J.
Pfister Knitting Company of Fan
Francisco, has offered eleven sweaters as
a trophy to the class winning the
championship in a series of games to be
played on the campu*.
These are the very best sweaters ever
made on the Pacific Coast and are worth
in the neighborhood of $75.00. They
are furnished to us at. a nominal cost.
A sample sweater will be on the grounds
in a few days for the inspection of can
didates for the different teams.
It is the desire of the management
(hat the football managers of the dif
ferent classes arrange a schedule as
soon as possible, so that the series may
be finished before October 20, the date
of the Varsity's first, game.
An admission fee will be charged to
the series. Probably the tag system
will be employed, as heretofore it has
met with such good success. It is
hoped that the money raised this way
will be sufficient to defray the expense
which will be necessarily involved in
bringing the coach wist in the neat
future.
