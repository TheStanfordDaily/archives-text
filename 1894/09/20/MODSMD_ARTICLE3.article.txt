# Scheel's Symphony Orchestra.
## 
### 
The opportunity seldom presents
itself of having with us an orchestra of
great renown; but Prof. Goebel informs
us that there is a possibility of inducing
Scheel's Symphony Orchestra to give a
concert here sometime this fall or win
ter. Most of the students are ac
quainted with Prof. Scheel, who was
the leader of tho famous Vienna Prater
Orchestra, which proved one of the
leading features of the Midwinter Fair
in San Francisco last winter.
Prof Scheel was the conductor of
the orchestra under the celebrated
Hans von Bulow of Hamburg, and
came to this country at the time of the
World's Fair, bringing with him his
orchestra, which became widely and
popularly known at Chicago. Prof
Scheel is now giving symphony concerts
in San Francisco, and it rests entirely
with the students whether his orchestra
is secured or not. If they volunteer
hearty support such a concert as would
be rendered, consisting of both classic
and modern music, would be made a
reality. In place of a large assembly
hall the gymnasium could be utilized
as the only place suitable for the
appearance of such a orchestra.
