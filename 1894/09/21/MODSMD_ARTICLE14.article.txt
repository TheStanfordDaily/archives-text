Thk notice in another column of
an open air concert to be given by
our Band two weeks from touight is
a very gratifying oue. The energy
shown by its members so eaily in the
year deserves great credit. This is
perhaps thn only concept that can be
given before the cold weather begins
und everyone should be present to
show their appreciation of the hard
work elone bv the I'and.
