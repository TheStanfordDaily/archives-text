Tliere are several new students who
have yet to learn that it is not usual for
one student to employ the recitation
hour in expressing private views, or in
asking questions having only a private
interest. It is often very embarrassing i
to the instructor to have the lecture in
terrupted by an irrelevant question;
and it is anything but pleasant to tlx;
other members of the class to have one
student persist in supplementing the
remarks of the lecturer l>y personal
opinions. The professor is usually too!
chaiitable to openly reprove the of
fender, and the students have no way
of showing their disapproval. It.i
presumed that the offenders err in ig-j
noranee, and that the nuisance will
cease as soon as commented upon.
