# The
						Practice Last Night.
## 
### 
The largest crowd of the heason wit
nessed the practice last night. There
were the regulation eleven men on the
second eleven, thus doing away with a
dangerous element, which caused the
accident to Spalding on Wednesday,
When there are fourteen or fifteen men
on a side it is very difficult for the
players to keep out of each others' way.
Jack Reynolds played with his usual
dash, making several fine runs. Claude
Downing played a spbndid game at
full-back, though weak yet at punting.
Abe Lewis w;is out for the first time
this year, and distinguished himself by
his tackling. The new men on the
second eleven showed a decided ignor
ance of the rules by making a number
of fouls liosendale placed center on
ihe first eleven fora part of the time
while Downing devoted himself to coach,
