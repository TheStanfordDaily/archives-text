# Miss Benfey's Reading.
## 
### 
The critic of a cliapel entertainment
is seldom at a loss for an initial phrase,
lie may usually count upon saying,
"There were not so many there as there
should have been." Whin Miss Ben
fey's reputation is considered it is some
what surprising to find this sentence
applicable. A very meagre attendance
on the part of the faculty was especially
noticeable. We of the flock expect to
see them when first-class talent comes
here. Another favorite phrase is at
our command: "The few who did go
were well repaid."
Miss Benf'ey's stage presence is inter
esting. Her face is not pretty, but its
intelligence and expression are marked,
and her carriage is excellent. She
was beautifully gowned.
Her program was mainly concerned
with her dramatization of the "Tale of
Two Cities." Few pieces of literature
are benefitted by the hashing process.
Miss Benfey's judgment is good
though; her selections were essential
and well counected, and called for con
siderable versatility in the reader. The
general tone of the story, as she gave
it, was serious, lightened by two comedy
scencs. In th<>se she was clever, never
overdoing them in the least.
Miss Benfey's voice is resonant, and
not masculine. ller assumption of
male characters was very good, but
must have taxed her throat This does
not mean that any effort was apparent
to the audience. There was a slight
monotony, hardly noticeable, in the
reader's voice, which is perhaps inevit
able when a variety of personages are
made to speak.
Two portions of Miss Benfey's read
ing will not leave the memory of her
audience very soon. During the des
cription of the peasants' wrongs, the
harsh injustice of the aristocracy, the
reader's eyes were filled with tears
which they could not quite contain, and
we felt it was not a trick Some of us
who have heard Prof. Howard's course
in the Frcuch Revolution have
H ccn him choke and stop in the
middle of such descripUbn. And when
Miss Benfey showed us the frenzied
woman of the Paris streets crying for
vengeance, she carried evjryono with
her. It was uot ranting or overdoing
in any way; it was art, almost geuius.
After this splendid bit of work it was
not easy to keen the tone from lowering
slightly. The audience was interested
to the end and the leader left the stage,
after her rendering of the solemn words
from the burial service, followed by
siucere applause.
Miss Benfey then gave short select
ions from Atneriawn short-story writers
of today. The first, a summer story by
H. (5. Bunner, w is very cleverly done
Miss Benfey touched ever so delicately
the trying part of the ingenue, and the
selection was pleasant after the tragedy
of her first part
Perhaps it would have been better if
iihe had not given the selections from
Miss Wilkins, although she read them

very well, indeed, they could not but
sound ratlier flat after what preceded
them. With Mr. Bunner's light story
us a relief to the tragic narrative just
given, the program could have closed
nice'y.
Miss Benfey goes east on Tue.sday.
Her reappearance here would be warmly
welcomed.
