Tiie enthusiasm with which the
student body rallies to the support
of its enterprises is a fact in which
every member of the University has
reason to feel a sense of pride and
gratification. The junior farce,
which will be given about the mid
dle of October, and the profits of
which will be devoted to the foot
ball furd, is a noticeable example of
their enthusiasm. As such it de
serves warm praise and earnest sup
port.
