Tiie names of forty students who
had been granted permission to
change their course was posted on
the bulletin board a few days ago.
Of course these petitioners were old
students. The number of o d stu
dents here this year is approximately
six hundred. Forty out of six hun
dred is a very large proportion.
Such a prop >rtion would seem to
show that many students come here
without any defined object. This
is not vicious in itself but it
represents an increasing tendency to
jump about, from one department to
the other, which often results dis
astrously. In the efforts which first
year men make to become broadened
by dipping into many things and
trying many courses, there is great
danger that the broadening will pro
duce superficiality much to the an

noyance of those wbo are compelled
to listen to their talks 011 abstiuse
things.
