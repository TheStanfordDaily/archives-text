# A 						Relic for the Museum.

### 
A day or two ago Miss Anna Dixon
of Napa sent to Mrs. Barnes a remark
able pestle which will ho placed in the
museum. It was found by A. J.
Raney on his ranch in Capelle Valley.
The pestle is worthy of notice on
account of its size, being two feet and
nine inches in length. It is of stone,
well rounded, and in the neighborhood
in which it was found is regarded as a
unique specimen. It would seem to
have required two people to work it,
and possibly, instead of being a pestle,
may have been used as a roller with
which to grind seeds and acorns.
