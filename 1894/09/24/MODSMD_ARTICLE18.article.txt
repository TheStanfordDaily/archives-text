# A 						Berkeley Football Practice.
## 
### 
A Stanford inau saw the Berkeleys
practice for an hour Thursday eveuing.
Two full elevens and seven extra men
were on the field. The second eleven
was composed entirely of freshmen who!
are preparing for their game with San
Mateo. A good deal of punting was en- j
gaged in, liansome beiug apparently
fully e(jual to Oscar Taylor of last year.
Four old U C. players were coaching.
It is probable that Sherman aud
Archie Pierce will not play this year, I
so the centre is week. IJuut has been j
out but once so far.
The field is enclosed by a substantial
portable lath fence.
