The Rev. Horatio Stebbins, of San
Francisco, delivered the sermon in the
chapel Sunday morning. Hh spoke on
"The True Bank of the Intellect Among
the Human Powers." The sermon was
powerful, aside from the force and im
pressive presence of the speaker. Por
tions of his address, beginning with the
latter half, are given verbatim.
"There is a natural tendency of the
intellect to exalt itself in so many words.
The eye has no such exalted feeling of
itself. Look into the still and awful
grandeur of the night heavens. As
tronomers will tell you there are suns
and stars which his most powerful in
struments do not allow him to dctect.
Ask him whose researches are in the
world of the microscope. He will tell
you lie has but ascertained the existence
ofanimals which may be as monsters in
the eyes of the other population of a
drop of water. We infer from what
the eye reveals that there is a world
beyond which the eye does not reveal
This is no discredit to the eye.
Nor should the intellect be jealous
of the higher conquests which suggest
problems she may not solve. Indeed,
it is the supreme glory of the greatest
intellect to know how little it knows,
not how much. I he grandeur of the
intellect is that it suggests a world into
which it cannot go.
"What is a mystery? It is a hidden
truth; a truth uot fully revealed. . . .
Or, look again at those forces with
which we are familiar, those forces
which we call gravitation and attrac
tion. Do we think that we know all
about them? We merely name them,
and when we name them we have uot
named them at all, but, only their effect.
The intellect never saw gravitation; it
cannot see power. It knows only an
effect.
"We talk of the law of gravitation;
but what is a law? A law is not a
cause, but a rule of action. It is a way
of doing. But it is the power that acts
in this way, and not the way itself, we
call gravitation. Where is this power?
How is it to be grasped? There it is;
but it is inaccessible to the keenest
mind. You would gladly capture it,
but you are forced to confess it is some
thing beyond your comprehension.
"And we ourselves, fearfully and
wonderfully made as we are, what are
we but living embodiments of laws we
cannot comprehend. The live power
that feels and moves in our bodies
eludes all search. It is a hidden truth
which the intellect cannot uuvail
"How much more mystery, and how
far beyond the range of our understand
ing, is our nature itself! When you

regard its higher capacities; when you
study mind and personality, and that
marvellous mystery of language
wherein thought lakes physical form,
and passes by words from mind to mind.
What a catalogue of facts, always and
eveywhere so near to us, and yet always
and everywhere above our comprehen
sion. Now if these things are so, the
intellect is not the supreme facu ty of
our beings, for it suggests a realm
above ourselves, which we enter by a
faculty, which religion calls faith, and
scieuee, insight.
"Perhaps there is no thought which,
if reverently cherished, will so help
our spiritual life as this: that intellect,
to reach its true greatness, must be
subordinate. God forbid that 1 should
degrade learning, refinement, or intel
lectual culture, but these are not the
supreme powers; they are utterly unable
of themselves to exalt the individual
man or to make a people great. What
we want as individuals, what society
wants, is not so much increased intel
lectual force as awakened moral sensi
bilities. If intellect were the supreme
power in God, his lovliness would be
gone, and our belief in hiui would be
come suspicion. 'Let not the wise man
glory in his wisdom, let not the rich
man glory in his riches, but let him
that glorieth glory in this, that he un
derstandeth and kuoweth me.' "
