# Freshman-Sophomore Rush.
## 
### 
Friday night the sophs evened their
Bcore with the freshmen. Fora week
or ten days rumors of a coming rush
had been iu the air. The sophomore
organization was complete. Leaders
had been appointed for Palo Alto, May
field, the camp, the different fratern
ities, and each of the four floors iu
Encina hall. The freshmen were un
prepared and thoroughly surprised,
when the sophomore yells resoundad
from the football oval. Wneu, after
some delay, the challeuge was accepted
and the rush made, it proved hopeless lor
'98. In just twenty minutes seventy
eight sophs were eheeriug madly over
the prostrate forms Of the forty-seven
freshmen who had been hardy enough
to dare in the darkness of tho night,
the organized forces of '97.
The crowd was well sprinkled with
juniors and seniors who added their
yells to the geueral hubbub and aided
their friends so far as upper-class dig
nity would permit.
No serious accidents happened, and
good feeling was apparent at all times.
Soon after eleven the prisoners were
cut loose without, the usual treat of a
long ride on the county road.
