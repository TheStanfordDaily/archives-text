Those who had the courage to appear
in the field Saturday seemed to lack
spirit. The heat was the chief cause
of this, and it tended to keep many
nway who otherwise would have been
out. There were only eight men to

consequently the play was very uneven.
"Doc" Hall and Joe Field were out for
the first time this season and occupied
their respective positions as tackle and
guard on the Varsity.
