# Prof. Abbott's New Book.

### 
Prof. Nathan Abbott, the head of
the Stanford law department, has just
published through the Wc6t Publishing
Co, of St. Paul, a work on "Descent,
Wills, and Administration. The plan
of the book is entirely original, and
will prove of incalculable value to the
Rtudeut as well as to the practical law
yer. The plan, to quote from t.lÂ«e
author's preface is, "First, extracts
from standard works; second, selected
cases; third, statutes." Accordingly,
the volume comprises three parts.
First, the text, divided for convenience
into sections, accompanied by refer
ences to the appropriate cases and stat
utes in Part 1 and II; second, the cases,
numbered, with references to the
several sections of the text with which
they are to be read; and, third, the
statutes, also numbered, and with refer
ences to the sections of text."
This work will, no doubt, be wel
comed by every law school in the country
as its convenience to the student and
instructor is manifest. Heretofore, in
the study of any branch of the law, it
has been necessary for the student to
read the text, and go through the
library to search out the cases and then
the statutes. This work does awav
with all this labor, and brings the en
tire subject before the reader at once
The text is aselection from the standard
writeis and is therefore absolutely reli
able Among the authorities used are
Dighy's "History of Ileal Property,"
"Jarmari on Wills," "Williams on Kx
eoutors," " Woerner on Administration,"
and " Wiyram on Interpietation." The
cises chosen are all leading expositions
of law by the ablest jurists of this
country and Kngland. '''lie statutes
are chosen from the English, since they
include a much longer time than do the
American statutes reaching from Henry
1., including extracts from the Great
Charter, down to 1852 of Victoria's
rei<;n These statutes enable the stu
dent. to get the full history of" Wills "
from the earlie-t times, through all its
phases of development, down to the
present.
