The enthusiasm aroused by Manager
Hicks' device for inter class contests
was made apparent last night. Thirty
five men appeared upon the field ready
for practice The seend eleven was
in good condition and held down the
first very well, fn running, however,
the halves ran too hiyli and often carried
the ball under the wrong arm. The
punting was not so goid as iu some of
the practices last week The ends
must be careful and play well out so
that if failing in their tackle they can
at least turn the runner in toward the
center. Dr. Angell, assisted by a
couple of the old players, coached the
teams. After the practice the appli
cants for the freshman team lined up
fora few minutes. The following were
the men who lined up for the practice:
Heath ! e Steele
Hall 1 t Painter
Thomas 1 g Field
Downing c Irwine
Fickert r g Farrington
Cochran rt llice
