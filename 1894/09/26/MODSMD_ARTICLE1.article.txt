# Some Unrecorded University History.

### 
Before taking up the lecture of the
evening, l)r Jordan addressed a few
words to the students, speaking in sub
stance as follows:
"At the beginning of the term, 1
promised to give you some account of
the various things that have happened
during the summer. There were at i hat
time a many tilings thut needed
telling, but the enterprise of the |)aily
Palo Alto and the daily tisaminer
have taken nearly all I h,ive to say out
of my mouth. There is perhaps no
feature of the public history of the past
Hummer which every 6tudent does not
know. There has been during the sum
mer a great deal of talk about the
stability of the University, how it might
close its doors, how the immense tuition
fees might drive the students some
where else But in all of these, as you
know, there was very little truth
There is uotliing that any one need
worry over. The students may feel
sure that not a single person connected
with the government thinks for a mom
ent that the University or the estate it
expects to receive, owes the United
States any money. We are unable to
read the whole history of the origin and
prosecution of this claim, for part of it
is yet shrouded in darkness. I venture
to predict that the estate will be settled
by the 16th of July uext. Beginning
with the 16th of next July, this Uni
versity to be, and I believe w il
be, the richest university in America;
(prolonged applause) rich in gold and
bilver and stocks and bonds as it is rich
now in everything else—as it is now
rich in good-feeling und work and good
students. The main things that make
a university rich we have now. II
the necessity arises we can get along
without the $15,(j00,000, as long as we
have the rest
There was but one day injall itH ex
istence that the University was in
real jeopardy. It is now far enough
away from that time for me to tell when
it was. It was some two weeks before
the University opened a year ago. At
that time the courts had decided that
everything on farms belonged to
the University, and nothing else. Not
another dollar of the founders' estate
could be used until its affairs roachcd a
final settlement. The University was
in a sense made an orphan—cut off
without any money except that which
it could raise from these farms, and
without any possible way of drawing
upon the estate of its founder. All
this was at a time when every b»nk in
California was closed. At this time wc
were running into debt at the rate of a
good many dollars a minute. There
was no money in si«;ht to pay off super
fluous men, and men cannot be dis
charged without pay. It. was a very
dark day in the history of the Univer
sity when they told the surviving
founder, as they had to tell her, that
there was no possible way in which the
University could be opened. The farms
were producing a great deal less than

they cost; the students were not adding
to the income of the University. No
money could be borrowed, and none
could be had in any other way. I sup
pose that not one person in thousands,
perhaps not in millions, with all the
dark conditions about, would have hesi
tated to yield. Only a year or two of
waiting and then the University could
begin again. A temporary check in a
University seems to those who do riot
know its inner life, of no more import
ance than the closing of a flouring mill.
Mills are closed simply for repairs.
Why not Universities? We who are
within the body of the University know
better how it lives. It can have no
suspension of animation. If it ceases
to breathe it dies. Its doors once closed
can never open again.
And all this our founders knew by
intuition. The University was not
built to be closed at the first storm of
panic. It was not to die in the first
financial stress. There was no hesita
tion with Mrs. Stanford. She knew
her husband's purposes as no one else
could know them, and he knew hers.
She showed unfaltering courage and
sagacity, which we had not expected, as
well as the loyalty and devotion which
wc had always known her to possess.
There was one resource which the
courts and the panic could not take
away—her diamonds. This beautiful
collection was the gift, of love from her
husband. It washers to use as love
might prompt,. These treasures would
be freely given to the charity which was
her husband's greatest claim to grate
ful remembrance. Till these were gone,
all would go on as before. Not a door
of the University would be closed.
And none has been closed. The de
cision once made, all influences turned
in our favor. The Fates support every
righteous decision. It is safe only to
be courageous. The students came
back. Help came from unexpected
sources, and help which made it clear
that the diamonds would not be needed.
They are awaiting some greater crisis,
a crisis which, I hope, will never come.
In this test Mrs. Stanford showed
herself as one of the world's great
women, great not alone in goodness and
affection, but great in resources, in
nerve and courage, great in those qual
ities that make people famous for all
time. Had she hesitated for an hour,
the doors of the University would never
have opened again. As it is, no one
will ever see them closed.
The claim that, the United States
Government has brought forward is
annoying. It is not pleasant to be
even in friendly warfare against one's
own country. The suit prevents us
from beinn certain whether the Ger
man class next year will be a three
story or a four story class The fifteen
millions we hope to have; we need it in
our business. Hut even this is a minor
question. If the money belongs to the
United States, we can do without it.
In the spirit of freedom, in the spirit!
of honesty, in the spirit of thorough-'

ness, in the spirit of co-operation, in all
those things which are the making of a
University—this University i? rich. Iu
these it may never be richer. The
glory of a University is not in its big
ness, but in its spirit. The students
are the heart of the University By
the traits of the heart the life is to be
judged.
