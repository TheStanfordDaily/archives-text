Thk Students' Guild is an organ
ization which concerns every mem
ber of the University. Any one of
us may at some time in our college
career he bo placed us to need its
help; misfortune in no respecter of
persons. It should devolve, then,
upon the student body to see that
the Guild lias a sound financial basis,
for practical help must be in com
mand of money as well as of sym
pathy. The Guild has on its hands
a debt of nearly one hundred dollars
and it needs money now to yrevent
actual suffering in our student body.
Since the cause is a jjood and just
one, and since the passing of a sub
scription list is, on the whole, veiy
unsatisfactory and extremely < m
barassing, the plan has been sug
gested, and it seems a good one, that
the Associated Students, by the Uvy
of an assessment, say twenty-five
cents apiece, should raise money to

allow the present good work to be
carried on to a successful completion,
and permit the Guild to be ready for
any emergency which may arise.
