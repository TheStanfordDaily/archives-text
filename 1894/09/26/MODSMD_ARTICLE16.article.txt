# Football Practice.
## 
### 
There was more life and vim dis
played on the football field last uij>ht
than on any night since the opening of
the season. This was due in part to
(he favorable condition of the weather,
but in a far greater degree to the fact
that there were three men coaching,
and urging the men to their best efforts.
Prof. Angell, Paul Powning, and Frank
eubeimer acted in this capacity. Prof
Symington and Jack Sheehan acted as
umpire and referee respectively. The
sight of the professors on the field does
much to awaken iutenst among the
atudents,
De Wolfe, Hurrelson, C. Downing,
und Lewis made several fine runs.
Jennings, Jost, and ('ode showed up
best in tackling. There was entirely
too much fumbling, and the men still
persist in running too high with the
ball. Another great fault is that of
tackling too hiyh; there are perhaps a
half a dozen men on the field who tackle
properly Again, last night, the danger
of having too many men on the second
eleven was shown. At least one of the
two accidents which occurred was due
to this fact. It is high time that a halt
was called in this matter. When the
old field is put in order there will be no
excuse for there being more than eleven
men on a side.
After the regular practice, the fresh
men lined up and practiced signals.
The freshmen were also out at six
o'clock in the morning, practicing.
They are displaying a commendable
teal, but the danger that the players
will become stale from over-traiuing is
one against which they should be caut
ioned.
