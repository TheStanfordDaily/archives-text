# Changes in Power-House Plant.
## 
### 
During the summer some radical
changes were made in the large 250 h.
p. Pitsford-Corliss engine in the power
house. A positive slide motion cut-off
was fitted to it, replacing the old valve
motiou which was unsatisfactory. The
steam pressure was reduced from 100
to 70 lbs. and kept constant at that
figure by a regulating valve. Mr. I)
J. Rogers, machinist for Garrett of San
Francisco, the makers of the engine,
will remain on the campus fora month
or more yet in order to make sure of its
reliability. Students who used electric
lights last year, no doubt have noticed
the increased steadiness of lights this
year, for which these improvements are
responsible.
