# TUESDAY EVENING'S LECTURE.

'"The Fate of Icidorum," by Dr. Jordan.
Who was Icidorum? This question has
been heard for several days on everv
hand. Some said he was an Homeric
hero contemporary with Jacob; and
others that he was an extinct, species of
fish, and that Dr. .Jordan intended to
use that fact as a basis for some kind
of allegory
Owing to the conflict in the advices
of Proverbs, it is hard to see the line
which any comment, on the lecture
should take. The unity of satirical
sagacity, punning, and presidential dig
nity is in itself so uncommon that any
serious and extended comment is hardly
practicable To summarize a funny
tale of twelve thousand words in a
paragraph, needs some such power for
the concise expression of condensed
thought, as distinguishes the following
extract taken from " The Fate of Ici
dorum:" "Hut. the years went on, the
wars were ended, the rain fell, the birds
sang, the grass grew, the people came
back, and Issoire arose from its ashes."
It is needless to say that we are not in
command of such skill.
