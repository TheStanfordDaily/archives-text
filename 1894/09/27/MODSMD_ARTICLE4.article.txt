# The 						Proposed Athletic Association.
## 
### 
At the mass meeting to be held in
the chapel tomorrow, it is intended to
test the feeling of the student body
concerning a change in the manage
ment of athletics here.
It. is proposed to form an association
having complete control of Varsity ath
letics. Members of the faculty may
become members if they so desire; old
students can also retain membership,
and every student on the campus would
be eligible for membership. All mem
bers would have to pay some nominal
annual fee. According to the scheme
everyone wishing to take a part in inter
collegiate athletics, or to be a member of
any Varsity team, would have to be a
member of the association and be in
good standing also. Several large east
ern colleges have a similar organization,
and fcrm good models fot the present
idea.

A board of directors, perhaps seven,
would be elected by the association,
and would be given almost unlimited
power in the control of affairs, more
espeeially'of the financial part of the
athletic management. Such a change
as this organization would effect, might
do much to help in obtaining a surplus
at the close of the football season.
