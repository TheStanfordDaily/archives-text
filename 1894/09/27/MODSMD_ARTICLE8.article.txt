# Football Practice.
## 
### 
The practice last night was not such
as would encourage an enthusiast with
our prospects for the Thanksgiving
game. The play with bur, few except
ions was lax and slow. The tackling is
still too high and lacks the spirit which
is essential to a clean down. The punt
ing was hut fair. Pit less we are able
to discover a good kicker between now
and November, our chances will be
greatly lessened.
Capt, Downing played fullback for the
Varsity, and under the interference of
Code and lluvsoll made a numb r of
long rims. Painter, '98, downed Capt.
Downing by one of the prettiest tackles
seen on the field ibis year.
After the practice the '93 team under
Capt. Kennedy lined up fora few min
utes against the freshman teaui.
