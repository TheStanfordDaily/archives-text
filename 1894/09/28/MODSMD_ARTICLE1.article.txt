## 
### 
Last evening, to the law classes as
sembled in the chemical lecture room,
Professor Abbott introduced Mr. W. S
Barnes, district, attorney of San Fran
cisco county. Mr Barnes' subject was
"Criminal Law as Practiced Under the
Code in California "
"There is a thing, gentlemen, that
binds me to you more than effort on my
part, and endurance upon yours. We
are all of us young men; we are at the
threshold of our careers; we are press
ing forward to those gates of honor and
in lependen'*e that are being attained by
every young man whoso feet leap over
the boulders that, lie strewn in his path,
and whose eyes are li<ced upon his guid
ing star.
"There is a great feeling in this state
that, the man of the university is to be
the man of the times. Heretofore we
have had a plethora of what is known
in the profession as "Jack-legged" law
yers; those who have studied by the
Kurilt, of the candle and the kitchen fire
When I returned fresh from the Col
umbian Law School, to practice in San
Francisco, I chanced to ask an eminent
city I iwyer w hat school lie had attended.
He looked at me and said: 'I went, to
the Touluume Law School. We didn't
hive any of these professors out here
but whenever I wcat into a court and a
point was raised I didn't understand, I
would pick up my inkstand and throw
it at the opposing lawyer. The judge
would lock iim up twenty four hours fir
contempt, and while in such confine
uient I would study up the point and
be ready for that lawyer.' In days
gone by the criminal lawyer was a
smaller man than he who practiced at
the bar. Isut now it, is different."
The speaker related several reminis
cences of legal practice, and then gave
an interesting outline ol the steps in the
prosecution of a criminal, showing the
defects in criminal procedure, owing to
the retention of institutions whose only
justification for existence is their u::-
tiq iity Mr. Barnes related the story
of Jiin my Hoke, a notorious safe burg
lar, who was captured in the vault of a
San Francisco bank. Ry resort to
time-honored methods of obstruction
the trial was indefinitely prolonged,
but after two years and a half detention
in the San Franoisco j iil, the authorities
became so tired of him and his counsel
that lhey agreed to let him go if he
would leavo the country. Ami this
notwithstanding the fact th it Mr. Hoke
was wanted in nearly every state in the
Union, and that ho had about 17.3 years
of unexpired terms to serve in various
states' prisons. "The grand jury,"
said Mr. Barnes, "is greatly to blame
for such a stato of affiirs; it is useless
and un-American."
In conclusion he said, "It is upon
men, such as you, that we at th# bar
have got to depend. When you grad
uato from this institution, when you
come out to take your places in the
noblest, profession God ever allowed man
to study, then and then only, from a

professional point of view, will
California of ours take ler rightful
place among her sister states."
