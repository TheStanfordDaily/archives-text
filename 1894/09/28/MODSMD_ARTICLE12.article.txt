It ought to be unnecessary to hint
that it is not impossible for an upper
classman to tell a freshman at sight,
and that it is a mere waste of time
for him to proclaim his class pro
clivities in reason and out of season
on the varnish of desks, chairs, and
woodwork. The seeming indiffer
ence of the old students to him is
not at all due to ignorance of his
foibles. Class pride is com mend
aide, but ihero is such a thing as
making a puolic nuisancH of it, and
public nuisances should be sup
pressed.
