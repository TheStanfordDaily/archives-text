'Jhe law lecturer last evening tvas
greeted by a representative $nd np
preeiative audience. Such support
of outside speakers is most encour
aging, as nothing will tend to bring
the college stu ient in touch with the
world more quickly than the meeting
of men of practical affairs. It is by
means of such talks as these that t l e
student will come to know the re
quirements for success in his spec
ialty.
They wi 1 also materially assist in
eradicating the idea that book lore
and a college course are the only
requisites fora flattering reception
by the world.
The practical nature of the lecture
will indicate, to some extent, what
the further lectures in the course
will be.
