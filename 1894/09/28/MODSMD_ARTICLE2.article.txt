# The
						Mass Meeting.
## 
### 
About, seventy-t.vc students attended
the meeting this afternoon in the chapel
to consider the advisability of forming
an athletic association. Pres. Hinsdill
called the meeting to order, and Prof.
Richardson was elected chairman of the
meeting. After a few opening remarks
by the chairman, Gregory, '90, moved:
''That it he the sense of this meeting
that an athletic association be formed,
with a hoard of •luectors, one of whom
shall be a member of the faculty,"
This opened the matter to discussion.
Some of the arguments made were in
substance as follows:—
E. R. Z'on: Because this system
works well in the east is no reason why
it should here. In the east, football
men have to pay twenty dollars to a
fund for football outfits The trouble
today is that the students at large have
not enough to say in the management of
such tilings Ry students at large, I
mean those outside of athletics as well
as inside. Now, it is proposed we have
two committees, an athletic and an ex
ecutive committee, the ath'etio com
mittee to adopt its by-laws with the ap
proval of the executive committee.
This part of our eoistiint ion wa« sub
mitted toward the end of last, term, hut
on account of one delay after another,
has not yet been fully adopted, Tt also
provides that the foo hall manager can
not. spend over 8590 without roriderin»
an account of the same and an itemized
account, may In* called fur any month.-if
necessary. I don't, think the historv of
our politics can show that if is possible
to put. in i fli -e a man that is entirely
unbiased. '! lie only way to <ret an ath
letic association is to amend the eoristi
fution of the student body. If two
thirds of the students think it. best to
have an association of that, kind then
wo can go ahead and form it.
I'rof. Symington irave a full account
of the methods and success of the ath
letic asgocinf,ion in Johns Hopkins. In
c'osinir his remarks he said: '•Treas
urers and managers shr.uld render at
once a 112 ull account, of all moneys spent,
that everyone may know just where the
money goes."
Scott Calhoun thought, that, if an
athletic association were formed with
monthly dues, it would make everyone
personally interested in the expend
itures. On account of there being no
such organization, the majority of stu
dents are not personally interested ;
hence the laxity in keeping accounts
Ilinsdil! rose to inform the meeting
that the footbaM manager is anxious
and willing to make itemized reports
every two weeks, if necessary
Prof'. Richardson: No system is go
ing to work unless able, competent men
arc elected as officers. If you arc con
vinced that you have a good system
now in sight, it would be well to give
it a trial.

Collins: The whole indifference on
the part of the student body to pay
assessments arises from the lax system
of accoun's.
Hicks: I am in fuvor of an athletic
association with a member of the faculty
at the head, and with a committee to
which the football manager is responsi
ble.
Sheehan: One of the main objects
of this association will be, to see that
there is money left over from the foot
ball season to carry on the other legiti
mate college sports.
' Question" was ca 'e I for, and Greg
ory's motion was carried by an over
whelming majority.
A motion was made and carried:
"That the chairman appoint a committee
to draft a sample constitution for this
proposed athletic association. Meeting
adjourned at ':45 p.m.
