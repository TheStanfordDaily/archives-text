# Dr. Thoburn's Sermon.
## 
### 
Very late yesterday morning Dr.
Jordan received a telegram from the
Rev. John M. Chase of San Francisco,
saying that on account of siekuess he
could not come and deliver the sermon
as announced. Dr. Thoburn was called
upon to fill his place, and, with but a
few minutes preparation, addressed the
audience in substance as follows:
"On Christ's first Sundny at Ns«7-
arcth be went to the synagogue. lie
was at war with the church; still he at
tended. The way to reform the syna
gogue is not to stay outside and throw
stones at it, but to go in and talk there.
Christ said, I am come to make it easy
fora man to earn bis daily bread, come
to bridge the gap between the rich and
the poor, to fill up that gulf, so that
there will be none. If you take the
word 'poor' and all references to it
out of the bible, there would be little left
"We hear much about poverty today
because men are finding out its evils
and are trying to remedy them,
"Phillips Brooks, it is said, never
preached on any other text but '1 am
come that ye might have life,'
'fChrist was not a danger signal set
up in the path of the world to tell men
of pitfalls ahead. He was a life saver,
Open the gospel stories and you will
always find lie was down in the slums,
where people were sick and suffering,
standing in places which were disagree
able to everyone. If you had been in
Gallilce in those days and wished to
find this great teacher, you would have
searched the places of the rich for him
in vain.
'•Christ is all life. Not simply relig
ious life. He touches man everywhere;
in bis studies, in his business, in bis
care of bis body, in his watchfulness,
over his thinking. If we are going to
lift up the race we will have to talk
religion very little. We will have very
little time for it. Christians today are
those who go into houses where people
do not know how to take care of their
homes, and help to right them;
are those who go where ignorance of all
kinds is to be found. Religion is not
a creed or a formula. God is not con
fined by a house of prayer, to be teased
into activity once a week and then al
lowed to sleep through six days. Our
conception of God was a very childish
one. Christ fought that conception all
his yeaTs.
"You will remember Bunyan's story
about the City of Destruction, how
Pilgrim got away from it just as fast as
he could. Christ wouldn't have run
away from that city. He would huve
stayed and helped everyone get out of
it that he could.
"There is a story that once a man
fell into a pit. A Brahmin came along,
and sat down and soliloquized;
" 'That man was bad, therefore he fell
int » the trap '
"Next a Mohammedan passed, and he
sat near the edge, and said:
" 'It is fate, that man was born that be
might fall into that pit.'

"Next a Hindoo, and many others,
till a ring was all about the hole, phil
osophizing. A Christian came up, and
when he had elbowed his way through
the crowd, and saw the man in the pit,
he jumped down into it and helped him
out. That is Christ's spirit, to preach
after the man is saved, philosophize
afier ihc w« rk is done."
