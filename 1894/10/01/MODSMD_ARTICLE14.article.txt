A question which ought to be
carefully considered and which will
surely come up before the next inter

notngiinst the spirit of a co-educa

from the competition? ihat is prac

young women have no debating

Surely it cannot matter to this
University whether a woman —or a
man—belongs to a debating or liter
ary or ethical society, if she only
have the ability to win a place on
the debate under competition. But
it can and does matter if we debar
a certain class of our students from
competing for the only intercollegi
ate event iu which they can take
part, by requiring them to belong to
a something which has no existence.
