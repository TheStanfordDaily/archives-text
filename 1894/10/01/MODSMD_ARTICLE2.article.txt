# The 						'95 Annual.
## 
### 
In order that we may quickly dis
pose of the remaining '95 Stanford
Quods, and thus close up our account
with the publi>hers and render a state
ment to the '95 Class, we have decided
to make the price of the Quad 51.50
for everybody. The annual is on sale
at the Co-operative Store and at room
108, Kncina Hall.
A few of the fraternities still owe a
small balance for space and express on
book plates. If this is kindly settled
at once, fraternities will oblige the class
as well as save themselves further an
noyance. N. G. Buxton,
Business Manager.
