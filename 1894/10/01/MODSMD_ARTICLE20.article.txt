# Football Review.

### 
In making a review of the football
work up to the present, it, is wtll-nigh
impossible to make any remarks Hint
are not already trite. Lack of vim,
lack of thorough interest has character
ized much of the work. The slowness
with which the men line up is painful
The lack of aggressiveness on the part
of each eleven is also a great delect
The ball is not followed by more than
one third of the team, and those who
play hard and fast and follow the ball
are compelled to stand waiting for the
stragglers and dawdlers to come up be
fore the ball can be put in play again.
Such sluggishness destroys the possibil
ity of a quick, snappy game. The
tackling is all too high; once in a while
some brilliant work is done, but ir is
erratic; the new men must learn the
gospel of successful playing. Tackle
low, tackle hard, follow the hall, and
don't inform the umpire or assist the
coach. The team has practiced for al
most a month now, and new men should
have learned some of these things be
fore.
Another thing that has caused some
misunderstanding is the lack of a recog
nized temporary coach. If different
men take a hand at coaching every
night, the men fail in their obedience
to his orders, and in their respect tor
his opinions. Half a dozen men can
not indicate in an intelligent way how
the team should play; one man is ample.
The umpire and referee are doing good
work, and deserve credit for their cri
er try a"d devotion. The captain should
be more aggressive, and make use of
the confidence the men so deservedly
repose in him to urge them to pi iy in a
more unified and intelligent way.
