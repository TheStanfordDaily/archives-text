The first game of the inter-class series
was opened by a game between the
teams of '95 and '97. Contrary to
general expectation, '95 was only able
to make one touch-down, and that by
mere luck Owing to the uncertainty
regarding the time set for the game,
the teams did not line up until after 4
p.m. Tha sophomores won the toss
and chose the north end of the field.
Fickert led off by a kick which was
caught by Kussell, who carried the ball
well forward to the center of the field.
'95 lined up, and Code passed the ball
to Lewis who circled the left end uuder
good interference fora touch-down, the
first and only one of the game. Code
kicked the goal. The ball was carried
to the center of the field, and again
kicked into '95 territory. The rest of
this half was a continual struggle in '95
territory.
In the second halt the advantages
were about equally divided, neither
team scoring.
The game throughout was noticeable
for the large amount of fouling and off
side play, both teams losing repeatedly
for these offences. The play was very
slow. The interference was, in gen
eral, very poor, and the tackling high
and uncertain.
The general fee ing prior to (he game
was that the '95 line would be very
strong. On the contrary '97 men re
peatedly broke through, and d >wned
the '95 runners. The line of' 97 made
up for the poor team work of her backs
Lewis, Kussell, Langford ( and Down
ing made the best showing on the '95
team. Thomas, '97, as halfback, made
a number of good runs betweeu tackle
and end. Williams, Rice, Fickert, and
Arnold also did good work for the
team.
