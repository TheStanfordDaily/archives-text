Tiik, mistake mado over the time of
playing the Swnior-Sophomore game
yesterday was very annoying. The
students are paying for admission to
this series of games and should be
correctly informed mm to the time tlie
managers decide to have the game
played. It was posted to be played
this afternoon at 4 o'clock, whereas
by some whim it came off yesterday
afternoon.
