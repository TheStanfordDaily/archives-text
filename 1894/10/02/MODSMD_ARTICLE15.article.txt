Attention has been called to the
danger to pedestrians, occasioned by
the presence of bicycle riders on the
sidewalk between the University and
Palo Alto. Several accidents have
occurred recently which have caused
considerable annoyance to those iu
the collision.
The sidewalk is primarily for the
use of pedestrians. The bicycle is

recogu zed by luw lisa road vehicle,
aud as such lius rights upon the road
but not upon the sidewalk. On
dark nights the danger from collision
is well nigh unavoidable. It would
be well if wheelmen would attend to
this. If the road is too dangerous
fora wheelman, perhaps the side
walk which is least used by foot
passengers might be used by tlum.
