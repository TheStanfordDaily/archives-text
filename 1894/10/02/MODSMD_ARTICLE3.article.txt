Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Some time ago an article was pub
lished which said: "From this on none
but member* of some duly organized
society can represent Stanford in the
annual Stanford-U. C. debate."
The article Mated further that the
number of member? in eacli of the two
present societies was limited to thirty •
five; and that ''members become so only
on the invitation of the societies."
This plan is not likely to suit the stud
ent body, and to receive the approval
of the faculty. According to this plan,
and under the present conditions, the
number of students from which we will
be compelled to choose our representa
tives can not exceed seventy, which is
scarcely a thirteenth part of the entire
number of students.
This training, received in many other
societies and clubs, is as good as that
obtained in the average literarv society
Whatever the ciuse may he, compara
tively few students at Stanford take
any interest in literary societies. It
will hardly be presumed that even a
majority of the best debaters of thi.«
University are to be found in its two
literary societies. If we have been
correctly informed, two of our repre
sentatives on last year's debate were
members of societies. In fact, if the
literary societies of each University are
to hive control of the debates, they are
no longer inter-collegiate contests, but
merely contests between the literary
societies of the two universities.
Another plan for choosing the debat
ers has been suggested. It is, in sub
stance, to have the student body ask
Dr. Jordan to appoint a committee of
three from the faculty; this committee
to name a day on or before which all
those who wish to take part in the de
bate must hand their names to this
committee. The committee can then
arrange fora test of these candidates,
and choose the three best to represent
us in the intercollegiate event. Thi-j
plan will not prevent the societies
entering their men in an) way.
The following was written in defense
of the present plan by one who has per
haps taken more interest in debating
society work here than any other per
son
The question as to who should be eli
gible to participate in the inter-colleg
iate debate was settled last year only
after much discussion. The best dc

baters, the most forcible speakers, will
naturally be found in the literary socie
ties. There they will have a chance to
display and improve their powers. Of
all the candidates elected by the student
body last year to the "free for all" pre
liminary contest, only one, a lady, was
not a member of a literary sooicty; since
there is no ladies' debating society, the
reason for this is obvious.
To allow everyone who thiuks him
self capable of debating successfully
with the U. C. to attempt to prove it,
would require too much time. A fair
and just alternative, arid one which, in
order that all further criticism may be
stopped, will probably be adopted, is
to allow the student body to choose
three students—because no more, if
chosen, could possibly win a place—
who shall in a public manner demon
strate their fitness fora place on the
debate as compared with that of the
students chosen by the literary socie
ties.
