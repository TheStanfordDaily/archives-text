# Last Evening's Lectureâ€” "A Talk on Oregon."
## 
### 
Mr. Holman, editor of the Pacific
Jiural Press, lectured in the chapel
yesterday evening upon "Oregon."
The character and bent of the people,
rather than the physical Oregon, was
his theme. Two or three of the many
suggestive thoughts are given verbatim.
"The recorded history of Oregon
does not go back far enough even to
trace the genealogy of its name, which,
after a century's speculation, is as doep
a mystery as before.
"The influence destined to be per
manent in Oregon was that of the re
ligious enthusiast. The missionary
came, bearing the message of God to
man, but he brought the American flag
and American spirit.. From the early
thirties the missionary was the ruling
spirit in the Oregon country, and even
now in its larger development and mul
tiplied population, Oregon continues to
reflect the earnest spirit of those who
first redeemed her from the wilderness.
"Immigrants came from everywhere,
but they were overwhelmingly native
born. A good third came from Ken
tucky and Tennessee One-fourth of
the whole body who crossed the plains
to Oregon wcie plainly descended from
Scotch-Irish ancestors. ''hey wore
strong in body and spirit, I find it
demonstrated that the experience of
Oregon has been paralleled in all our
land. In the physical type which we
regard as the typical American the
Scotch Irish are most prominent. An
drew .Jackson, Thomas .Jefferson. Cal
houn, Clay, Sheridan, Sherman, Grant,
Blaine, the Harrisons, McKinley, and
Abraham Lincoln bear witness to this,
'' Late in the forties and early in the
fifties, the merchant from Boston and
New York followed the pioneer. They
were a Hjuiid of picked men. The ad
venture called for high qualities: health,
strength, business skill, and sterling
character under all. Down to this day
the names of those early pioneers have
continued in the forefront of Oregon's
conmcrcial and business life.
" The pioneer has been, in the lart'e
sense, the controlling power in Oregon.
He has made the laws, and inter
preted them, but he has never wrested
from the merchant his social promi
nence.
'Another instance of the homogeneity
of the people is that in the live com
mercial city of Portland with a populat
ion of 00 000, in a siate of 3 >0,000 peo
ple, there is one only newspaper (Ore
(/onian). Many have started there,
bu v all have failed The truth is that
there is only a man or two or three that
know how to make a paper acceptable
to the people of Oregon."
