# Communication.â€”Re Debating League.
## 
### 
Apropros of the inter-collegiate de
bate question, it might be suggested
that it was not intended that women
should be prevented from competing for
a place on the inter-collegiate contest;
or that our debaters should be re
stricted to any small Iractiou of the stu
dent body. But it was intended that
by the means of restricting the debaters
to members of societies, new and neces
sary societies would be urymiixed. The
Nestorian society has organized aud
joined the league already.
And now as to the women. There
is an almost universal demand among
the young ladies for some sort of a
women's literary society. The question
has been discussed for the last month.
A definite move is about to be made,
and if the same spirit is shown as was
exhibited last year in the Women's
Athletic Association, the women can
soon join something which docs exist,
and thereby have a chance to compete
in the preliminary contests without
further ado. Dues. Deb. League
