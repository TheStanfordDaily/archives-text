The game throughout was full of
brilliant personal plays and rallies.
Painter and Cotton, tackles for 98, re
peatedly broke through and tackled
the runners. '98, though much lighter
than '90, often made their live yards
through their opponents' line. Their
intelferenee was weak and showed sadly
the lack of practice. Their ends tack
led hard and low. l hry also got down
well on kicks, but failed to get into the
interference. The quarter, Allyn, was
slow but pure.
The '90 team far out-classed their
opponents in weight. They lacked,
however, the necessary team work.
On the line, Field, Campbell, and
Spaulding distinguished themselves by
brilliant work. Cochran, Cant Hardly,
and Reynolds, as bucks, did their usual
good work.
The game was opened by a kick-off
by Dole, caught by Cant Hardly, who
advunct'd the ball five yards, Reynolds
three, and Cochran two; '98's ball on a
fumble. Through lack of interference
the freshmen were unable to run the
ends, but bucked the '90 line for sev
eral gains. The ball passed to '90 by
u kick. Cochran was then sent, around
the right end fora touchdown. Cochran
missed the try for goal. Score, 4-0.
Tiifi ball lor the remaining part, of the
half was in '98 teiritory. Time was
called on the B*yard line.
During the second half both teams
resorted to kicking; the advantage in
this piny was with 90. The half
opened with a very pretty run by Cot
ton. He was called back however on
account of a foul. Ry steady work '90
forced the ball down to '98's 5 yard
line, when '98 got it on the third down.
Dole then kicked and Reynolds re
ceived the bill atid brought it. up to the
10 yard line. '1)8 then got the ball on
a fumble and was compelled to make a
safety 0 0 The juniors again forced
the hali to '98's go I and sent Cant
Hardly over the line on tnekli's lark.
