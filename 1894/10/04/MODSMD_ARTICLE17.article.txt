The captain and manager of the
Varsity team should bo the supreme
authorities in footbill matters. No
class team should bo allowed to piny
a man whose chances for the Varsity
are hurt thereby. It is unfair to the
man and to the team that one who is
only partially recovered from an in
jury should l)e urged to play from
motives of class loyalty and agiinst
his own judgment. The success or
defeat of any class team, it must be
remembeieil, is as nothing when
compared to that of the Varsity.
