In Hn se days of warm weather,
when windows must lo open to
render the lecture and recitation
rooms comfortable, the rn'tie of ve
hicles outside is a source of great,
annoyance. What, need there is for
buses sprinkling carts, freight
wagons to take the drives under the
windows when otheis would be as
convenient, is inconci ivable.

tion. Some remedy should be
found for it. A word to the drivers
lioin some one in authority ought to
prevent a groat, part of the distract
ing noisr.
