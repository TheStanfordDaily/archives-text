# Fire Hydrants and Hose.
## 
### 
The lack of information concerning
the position of the hydrants was the
occasion of some humorous incidents
last night. When the whistle blew its
short blasts, Eneina was suddenly alive,
and some excited fellow punched a hole
with his fi->t through the thick glass
which protects the hose in Encina
Hall, and dragged out the hose and
dropped the nozzle down into the lobby
so as to be in readiness to extinguish a
blaze in the row. This is paralleled by
the report that members of the faculty
were seen running with garden sprink
lers and rubber tube to the scene.
Fire hydrants are situated about, the
campus as follow: One at the rear of
the homes of Professors Richardson and
Sanford, in Alvarado row; one each
behind Zeta Psi House and Mrs. Rab
cockV; oue in front of Dunn's, Lasuen
street; two are to be found at the rear
of Encina, and the same number be
hind Ruble. In front of the power
house one is to be found, and oue each
in the quadrangle flower-beds.
Hose reels as follow: Two in the
quad , one in the camp, one at the rear
of Alvarado row, two on the second,
third, arid fourth floors of Encina, and
four on its first floor, two on each of the
floois in Roble and one near ltoble
gymnasium.
lu case of a fire, the steam whistle at
the power-house will he blown. Should
the blasts he continuous, it. signifies
that the lire is dangerously large, and
that the men at the stock farms are sig
nalled. There is no regularly organized
