# Criminal Procedure in France," by Prof. Brun.

### 
The procedure in the criminal courts
of Franco differs greatly from the
American. Kx-convicts are continually
watched hy detective?, who assist the
prosecuting attorney in making out his
cases; and duv hy day they make re
ports to the state as to the movements of
tlie suspected men.
Alter an accused person is arrested,
he is taken before a captain of the
police, where he is hastily examined,
and the evidence sent to a county mag
istrate, called the juge d' instruction,
who issues a mandate requiring the
accused to he br»>utiht before him.
Now begins a system of mental torture
by means of which the magistrate hopes
to force a confession from the prisoner.
Kveti the dead body of the victim (in
ease it is a murder), if possible, is
blought into the room to terroiize the
accused, and enable the magistrate to
read his guilt in his countenance. No
counsel is allowed on belnlf of the de
fense bclore this magistrate.
After this investigation, the entire
as made out by the prosecuting
attorney, is .submitted to a section of
the Court of Appeals which determines
whether the proper procedure has so
far been observed. The case then goes
before the Cour d' Assises composed of
three judges of the Court of Appeals
and a jury. lief ore this tribunal the
tr'ul proper is held.
The jury is selected from citiiens
who pay a certain amount of taxes
The jurors arc not questioned before be
ing sworn in, but either side may refuse
jurors until the court sees fit to permit
no more refusals.
The jury being sworn in, the Clerk of
the Court reads the information, which
is a nio.-t seardiing document, dealing
not only with the crime in question,
hut reviewing the whole history of the
accused. The attorney for the defense
can ask questions "of the witness only
through the court. Any such thing as
a cross exiitnin ition is unknown. The
prosecuting attorney pays little atten
tion to the evidence; it is his business
to abuse tin; prisoner. The eourt ap
proves of such prosecution and occas
ionally, itself takes pirt in it.
During the trial all the witnesses ex-

C'pt the one testifying are excluded
from the court room. If convicted the
prisoner has ten days in which to ap
peal to the Court of Cessation, and if
defeated there his last appeal in mur
der eases is to the President of the Re
public, who seldom interferes.
