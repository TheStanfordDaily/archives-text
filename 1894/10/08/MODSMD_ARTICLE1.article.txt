# SENIOR-FRESHMAN GAME.
## The 						Pioneer Class Maintains Its Record. The 						Seniors Win with a Score of 32 to 0. Six touch-downs and four goals. 
### 
Two entirely different games of foot
ball were played on the oval Saturday.
The first was a game characterized by
poor, slow, and loose playing on the
part of the freshmen and by large
gains made principally by the individu
al efforts of the seniors. The first half
was devoid of any particular interest
and brought little applause from the
spectators. The second half was an
even struggle between two evenly
matched teams and brought forth yell
after yell from the classes interested.
The former lasted twenty-eight minutes
and was the first halt of the '95-'9B class
game. The latter lasted just twenty min
utes — the length of the half agreed up
on by the captains. If '98 puts up tho
same style of game airaiust Berkeley as
she played in the fist half, she is very
apt to be defeated; if on the contrary
she puts up as good a game as she did
in the second half, her chanccs
of winning ar« excellent.
In the early part of the game '95
broke through any part of'9B's line at
will, while in the latter part, principally
by the phenomenal work of Fraziej, they
held '95 in the ceutor of the field.
Kennedy, captian of '95, played the
same star game as of old, but was com
pelled to leave the field on account of
not being hardened, as it was his first
appearance this year. Lewis made
some beautiful runs, having a majority
ot touch-downs to his credit. Ilarrel
son also distinguished himself by his
running and tackling. Code's inter
ference was superb. Downing, the old
reliable, was in every play and showed
his versatility by alternating at center
and full. Langford and Bancroft, the
comic team, were the butts of much
•'joshing" from the fence, all
played very well.
Of the freshmen, Frazier and Pauly
probably deserve the most credit for
stopping '95's triumphal march down
tho field. Allyn,. Allen, and Nice
monger played excellently, Soper's
punting was good but he showed inex.
perience in the other parts of the game.
Cotton proved himself an excellent and
quick tackier. Cochran and J.Reynolds
umpired and referreed, Frankenheimer
acted as linesman. The following is a
detailed account of the game:

Time called for first half. Score, '95,
28; '98, 0.
The second half was much better
football than the first. The freshmen
seemed to rise to the occasion and be
inspired with a determination to hold
the seniors down. This they did suc
cessfully, and fought bird and credit
ably all through the half, with tho ef
fect that the seniors only made one
touch-down in the second half, while
they made five in the first. The final
score was 32 to 0, in fnvor of'9s.
