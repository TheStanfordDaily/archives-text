Some complaint Las been made by
the players in the inter-class football
games that the time is not kept ex
actly. In many cases it appears that
they have had to play ton minutes
beyond the agreed time. This is ob
viously unfair. A weak team or an
inexperieuced one cannot maintain a
continued struggle beyond twenty
minutes at a time, and they should
not be made to do so because of for
getfulness in timekeeping.
