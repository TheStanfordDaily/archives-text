A communication has been received
from a lady student asking the best
way to agitate the organizition of a
ladies' debating society. Such au
organization as this lias been spoken
of beforo. The best Â»vay, it seems,
would be to call a general meeting
of all those interested, for eomo spec

ial time aiul place, and to elect a
temporary chairman. Committees to
attend to a constitution may then be
appointed, and if the organization
gets beyond this stage a flourishing
society may be the outcome.
