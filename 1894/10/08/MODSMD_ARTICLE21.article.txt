# The
						Promenade Concert.
## 
### 
Although the Hand lias been practice
ing but one month, the program last
Friday evening good.
The improvement over the Band of
last year is very marked. Every num
ber rendered was heartily applauded,
the only criticism being, that the pro
gram was altogether too short.
Leader Kaufman deserves great
credit for getting his musicians in such
good form in so short, a time. The
student body thoroughly appreciated
the concert and eagarly look forward to
the next one.
