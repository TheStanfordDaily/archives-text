# Sunday Sermon.

The Rev. Mr. Briggs' of San Jose,
preached the sermon in the chapel Sun
day morning. A report of the main
topics is given below.
Men are following Christ to-day as
the tides are following the moon. It isa
marvel that Christ 1900 years dead can
so influence men of today. Those two
hands which seem only yesterday in the
seeming weakness of the cross, are yet
today lifting empires. The sacred at
traction of the cross lies in the words of
our text; the words of Christ: " If I be
lifted up from the earth, I will draw all
men unto me."
The questiou is sometimes asked,
Was Calvary necessary? It.was neces
sary for several reasons: Nothing
else could have revealed the fullness of
Divine Love as did Calvary. Surely in
that death, infinite love hung with un
veiled face. Nothing else could have
so appealed to every individual. In
Calvary the love of God reaches the
humblest. I believe one wealthy, cul
tured home consecrated to Christ could
do more good than three churches. The
end of Christianity is to give, not to re
ceive. Calvary appeals to the degrad
ed as well as to tho humblest. No mat
ter where Christ had died if he had
died the death of inuocence, his death
would have appealed to the innocent.
Nothing else could "have appealed to
the whole world as Calvary did, because
Calvary is love.
