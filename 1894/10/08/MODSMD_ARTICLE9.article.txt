# Practice at Berkeley
## 
### 
Berkeley is practicing hard for her
coming contest, with the Reliance next
Saturday. The practice Saturday w:i»
fulPof vim and energy, due mainly to the
work of the new coach. The second
eleven showed up very well indeed
against the Varsity, most of the good
playing being done on that side, and
unless the first eleven strengthens up
considerably in their line, they will
have hard work to keep Reliance from
pushing them all over the field Satur
day. Their line is plainly very
weak, and the only advantage they have
is in the punting of Ransom, who is
certainly a star in that line. He made
a number of fine points Saturday, kick
ing goal from the field several times.
110 is the one man Stanf- rd and Reliance
have to fe«r.
