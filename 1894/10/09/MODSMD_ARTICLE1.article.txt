# THE 						STUDENTS' GUILD.
## Immediate Assistance Absolutely Necessary. 
### 
It will be remembered that u lew
weeks ago a collection was taken up at
a Tuesday evening lecture to defray the
expenses incurred by the Students'
Guild. The result was that ยง28.25
was subscribed. Tt is needless to say
that this buiu was wholly inadequate.
At present the indebtedness is about
SCO; another bill is maturing which is
expected will reach almost 8100. In
case students may not know tha objects
of the Students' Guild, the following
statement is made:
The Students' Guild was established
for the purpose of affording relief in a
financial way to needy students who
may be taken suddenly ill. and who
may bo far from home, a.id who are
without present resources.
Such cases occur quite frequently,
and should be provided for. The Guild
is not a charity organization at all, since
it is expected that those who receive
its help will refund the amount ad
vanced them whenever it is in their
power. In this way the Guild will be
self-supporting in the course of a year
or two
In order to raise the money necessary
with the least possible exertion, the
Daily Palo Alto proposes to open a
subscription list, to which all are in
vited to send in donations of any
amount. Up to the present the follow
ing is on the list:
Management Daily Palo Alto $ 5.00
