# GOOD WORK ON THE OVAL.
## Best Work of the Season—Enthusiasm Growing—Work Improving. 
### 
The football sympathizers who, in
the beginniug of the season, so bewailed
our bad luck and lack of heavy men,
may well begiu to take heart. For at
no time since the initiation of Stanford
football has so much interest been
shown in the game. Instead of two
incomplete teams, such as lined up a
month ago, every evening there are
sufficient candidates for four elevens.
Too much praise can not be given the
foot ball management for the admirable
manner with which the apparent disin
terestedness of the earlj season has
been overcome.
The play last evening was quite good.
The men worked well together, but still
lack the dash which must characteiize
their plav later on in the season. In
resisting line plays, th- men fail to get
low enough and invariably allow a gain
to be made. The halves learn to fol
low their interferenc and to run low.
Rice on the second eleven made a
number of pretty tackles and also made
good gains for his side. Russell and
Reynolds made good gains for the 'Var
sity. Russell, iu particular, is rapid ly im
proving. lie bits the line hard and while
not making any remarkable runs, can
always be relied upon fora gain. In
fighting an uphill game, Russell would
do good and steady work.
Capt. Downing and Kennedy coached
the Varsity. It is soon to be hoped
that the second eleven will also receive
some Fuch help as this The line-up
for the early part of the practice was as
follows:
Varsity Second Ei.even
Spaulding re Jennings
Cochran r t Rice
Thomas r g Farrington
McDonald e Irwin
Hurnett 1 g Fickcrt
Hall It Will iams
