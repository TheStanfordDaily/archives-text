# A
						Kind Invitation.
## 
### 
Mr. Henry Crocker, president of
the Ilorseshow Association of Sin
Francisco, has extended an invitation
to the members of the Stanford football
team to be present at an entertainment
given in their honor at the Mechanics'
Pavilion in the city, on Thanksgiving
evening after the gaum with Berkeley
It is the intention to receive tho team
with all due honor. I'hcy will ba
driven around the paddock in a coach,
and afterwards occupy the private box
of the president during the entertain
ment. It seems impossible that this
invitation can be accepted, owing to
tho arrangements that have already
been made by the Varsity musical clul>s
to give a monster concert in San Fran
cisco on the evening of Thanksgiving
Day.
