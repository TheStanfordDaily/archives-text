# THE 						READING BY MISS CALHOUN.
## Racine and Shakespeare to a Crowded Chapel. 
### 
By far tho largest audience this year
sat in the dark last night in the chapel
and waited for Eleanor Calhoun, actress
from the Comedie Francaise, Paris.
The crowd was perfectly good humored,
and spent the rather long wait in local
repartee. When Miss Calhoun ap
peared she was givej a hearty wel
come.
Of the entertainment nothing but
the highest praise cm be given Miss
Calhoun is not a dramatic reader; she is
u great actress in two languages. Con
sidering the crowded chapel, the poor
light, and the aggravating noises from
without, it must be conceded that it
was true genius that held for so long
the interest of the audience, many of
whom were uncomfortable, while the
majority did not understand the French
part of thj reading.
Prof. Bruri read the alternate parts
in the "10 Ermione" scenes from "An
dromache." Miss Calhoun recited the
classic lines with perfect facial expres
sion and beautiful accent. Her voice
is Jeanne llaoing's, deep, ever;, and
wonderful in its pathetic tenderness.
The selections from Slmkesperc were
delightful—the "Macbeth" reading full
of power, and the two scenes from "As
You Like It" charmingly delicate
The actress made every one who heard
her under such disadvantages long to
see her on the stage surrounded by her
•'actor friends" and all the accessories
of her art.
The best part of Miss Calhoun's
reading was its entire naturalness and
its freedom from studied effect. Iler
training has been such as to give her
this art of naturalness in the highest
degree. Her naive bits of explanation
and apology were fascinating, and when
she left the stage after her sudden
"good night," she had won her au
dience completely.
Later in the evening a number of
students serenaded the actress from
among the oaks of Xaxmin House, and
Shirley Baker sang the "Robin Hood
Serenade" Miss Calhoun came oui
upon the long balcony and thanked the
boys. She left this morning for San
Jose.
