The offek published in another
column to give a gold medal as a
piize for competition in the Stan
ford-U. C. debates is a gratifying
one, and will giva another impetus to
debating in the two universities. As
it would hardly be feasible to have
two debates each year, the Examiner
cup now in our possession and

erty of either university, would havo
to be competed for at the same time.
The only inconvenience would bo
the limit of subjects to contempor
ary French politics alone, but even
French politics are teeming with

questions very fruitful of contro
versy. The appreciated oiler of Barou
do Coubertin briugs to mind the gift
of another distinguished French
man, Count Donville-Maillefeu, who
presented our library with a baud
some set of Michelet's History of
the French Revolution.
