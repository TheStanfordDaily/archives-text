# On the Gridiron.

### 
As on Monday night, there was a
fine array of men on the field last eve
ning. The playing was not so fast as
usual nor was much good team-work dis
played, During the first f'ew moments
of the play the 'Varsity, on account of
its own lightning like work and the
loose playing of the second eleven,
made three touch-downs in rapid suc
cession. Alter that the teams settled
down to steady work and the second
eleven showed itself to be capable of
holding the 'Varsity down in a satisfac
tory way.
Jack .Reynolds made several fine runs.
His work is of the star order. He will
undoubtedly make one of our best
ground gainers by the time of the big
game. Spalding's tackling was one of
the prominent features of the practice,
Cochran plays an ideal game at tackle,
and can always be relied upon fora
quick, sharp, snappy game, which is
noticeable in every play. Pauley on
the second eleven, showed up well on
end last night. McCray is another
second eleven man whose playing
is of a brilliant nature. Lewis is
also playing a phenomenal game be
hind the line.
