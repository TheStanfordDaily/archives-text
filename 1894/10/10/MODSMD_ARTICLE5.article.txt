# THE
						CARNOT MEDAL.
## Another Prize for the Inter-Collegiate Debates. 
### 
Baron Pierre de Coubertin of France
has just mado through M. L.de La
lande, Consul of France at San Fran
cisco, the offer of a gold medal to be com
peted for yearly in an inter-collegiate
debate between Stanford University
and the University of California. The
subject of the discussion is to be some
topic connected with contemporary
French politics. The prize is to be
known as the " Medaille < arnot" in
honor of the late President Carnot. A
similar prize founded by the same gen
tleman, known as the " French Medal"
is contested for at the University of
New Jersey. Baron de Coubertin vis
ited Palo Alto and Berkeley some
time ago and this gift is in remembr
ance of his visit and the kindly spirit
toward France he found on the Pacific
coast. He also wishes the prize to
serve as a recognition of the work
which these two Universities are doing
for higher education, and he hopes
that tho competition for it may direct,
the attention of students to the efforts
which the French people are making
in the cause of progress. The details
of the competition are left in the hands
of President Kellogg and President
Jordan. The contest is to occur in
February of each year.
