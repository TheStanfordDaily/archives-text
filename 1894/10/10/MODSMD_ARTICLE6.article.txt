# Students' Guild.
## 
### 
Every student should make himself a
committee of one for the collection of
funds for this Guild. The cause is a
worthy one, the present debt must be
extinguished, and there is no other ap
parent way of doing so th;in by volun
tary subscription. Dr. Stallard has
kindly offered to attend, free of charge,
to all eases of sickness which tho chair
man of the Guild shall recommend to
him as needy and deserving. Such an
offer as this is of the utmost value to
the Guild just now.
Names are being handed in all the
time, and it is expected that the fund
will grow rapidly this week. Donations
should be sent in to the Editor Daily
Pa 1,0 Alto and noted as being sent for
the Students' Guild.
