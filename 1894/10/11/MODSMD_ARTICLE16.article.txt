To those who saw last year's foot
hall game the lack of systematic
effort to produce punters is very ex
asperating. The memory of Taylor s
long punts, winning back for Berke
ley in a moment the ground our
team had gained yard by yard, is not
plea ant. If the experience is not to
be repeated, hard, constant train
ing in kicking must be had So fur
little has been done iu that line.
The few men who practice punting
are allowed to use their own faulty
styles. The man who really gives
the greatest promise drops the bill
from one hand and in other ways
makes a very erratic, uncertain kick
Our men had the advantoge of ex
cellent coaching by Bliss, and to per
sist in awkward punting is as r pre.
hensiblo as to continue to run high
with the ball or to tickle around the
shoulders.
