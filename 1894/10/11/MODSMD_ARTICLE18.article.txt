It seem* to be my special privilege to
interpret for the general good the nuiuer
our s : ghs uttered by our young lady
students, who with heavy books under
their arms, traverse tbo quadrangle
Tiie common cry is: Let us have some
lock loxes where we can safely keep
our books, baskets, rubbers, etc. It.
is sad to say, but an evident i'act, that
wo liavn been obliged to carry our
belongings wheresoever we go —from
recitation room to gymnasium, from
gymnasium to postoilice, from post
office book again, and so on. Those
whose baskets have been examined and
their books stolen have been taught
this lesson by experience.
Fora not very largo amount, lock
boxes could be procured (something on
the plan of those in the gymnasium),
and there would be but a few who
would not be willing to pay a small
monthly due to secure the safety of
their belongings and the wearisome
task of c irrying burdens.
