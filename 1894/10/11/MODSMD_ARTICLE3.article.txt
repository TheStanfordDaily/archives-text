# Berkeley-Reliance Game.
## 
### 
With the exhibition of proper vim,
it is not too late to make arrangements
fora special rate to the city for Satur
day. Dozens of Stanford men want to
see this game. Not only do they want
to sec it, but they ought to see it, since
perhaps our chances with the Reliance
might be improved by a knowledge of
their style of playing. There is an
agent of the Southern Pacific on the
campus who can attend to this matter,
and if it is done immediately a special
rate will undoubtedly be the outcome.
