# Football Practice.
## 
### 
A fair sized crowd witnessed the
practice game last evening, but showed
very little enthusiasm. A few cheers
now and then alternating with the col
lege yell would inspire the men to much
better work. The students in general
seeui to think that they have shown suf
ficient loyalty if they appear once in a
while upon the field, and join now and
then in a feeble round of applause.
The practice itself, however, was not
such as to inspire a man to any particu
lar effort in the way ol noise. There
seems to be very little improvement in
the matters of high tackling, high run
ning, and fumbling. The punting is
fuir, but far froni what it should be.
The interference on the Varsity might
be improved greatly, while it is doubt
ful if there is any worthy the name
displayed by the second eleven.
Another fault of the pccond eleven
backs is that of running back after re
viving the ball. It is much better to
down the ball on the spot in an effort to
run forward than to loose ground by
running back. There is too much
holding in line also.
During the first few moments of play
the second team had everything its
own way, bucking the Yaisity center
at will. Hut later the tables were
turned.
Thomas and Fic'd i ?c the best
showing in the line. Thf former was

in every play. llis greatest fault is
high tackling. The latter repeatedly
broke through tl e line and stopped the
gains of his opponents. McCray tackled
and gained ground well. Carter ran
well for his side. Dole made some
beautiful gains through the center.
Super punted well, but is slow in start
ing lor interference.
The line up follows:
VARSITY SECOND ELEVEN
Spalding lend r. Stoddard
Hall 1 tackle r Watson
Burnett 1 guard r.. . Harrington
Field center Orcutt
Thomas r guard I Fickcrt
