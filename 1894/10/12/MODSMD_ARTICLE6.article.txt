# Law and Lawyers.
## 
### 
Dr. Jordan introduced Mr. E. It
Taylor, president of the San Francisco
Uar Association, to the law classes last
evening. Dr. Taylor's subject, " Law
and Lawyers," embraced a discussion
of the necessity and value of lawyers.
'•It has been said by one that 4 genius
is the capacity for hard work,' and by
another, ' the capacity for taking in
finite pains.' You will need both the
capacities carried to their highest to
succeed in law.
"When you come to practice, exhaust
your cases as they conic to you Find
out I lie principles on which they rest.
Do not, as soon as you get a case, run
to the law library after the digest, I
sometimes feel that we have lost great
ness at the bar in tie multiplication of
libraries and books. In the south and
west great lawyers grew up because of
the lack of libraries. They were com
pelled to ride their circuits with little
more than lilackstoneand Kent in their
saddle-bags, lint nowadays ii is tyro to
find a lawyer relying solely on pi in
ciples. I would advise you to search
alter principles first, >tnd the eases
afterwards.
"Hut though never so dilligent and
industrious in your profession, let not
this blind you to another danger,
li'irke said, 'The law is a Chinese
shoe to man.' So it is, if the mind is
given up to it exclusively. You should,
as your leisure offers, partake of what
Matthew Arnold so well denotes culture
lobe: 'lhe best which has been said
and thought in the world.' The great
poets are all of this, llead them; they
will make you better lawyers and better
men. Dip into gener.il literature, and
science as well. Any learning is better
than nothing. The true rule is, to
master, as far as otie can, one's own
specialty, and then to go afield into as
various directions as time will permit
"Another adage is that the law is a
jealous mistress-•meaning tliat no one
can hope to succeed in the law unless
he gives himself entirely to it. Tlii>
is a fallacy; one nerds only t<• look at
the great lawyers and judges to see it.
It is sufficient to point to the late Mr.
Justice liradley. He was learnt d in
every direction, and, as a lawyer, was
perhaps the best among his associates
on the supreme bench. Lawyers and
judges have been eminent in society,
in science and literature, and they have
been all the better for it."
