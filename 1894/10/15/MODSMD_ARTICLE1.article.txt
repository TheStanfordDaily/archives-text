The sermon Sunday morning by
liabbi Daoziger was one of the most
scholarly addresses delivered this y< ar.
The address was peculiarly interesting
as being the views of a learned Jew
upon the attitude of the Jews toward
Christ.
"What do men say the son of man
is?" lie gave it as his belief that a
great amount of the agnosticism of the
times is caused by men believing a
thing merely because their ancestors
believed it. "There are two classes of
.lews," he said, "as well as two classes
of Christians: those who think, and
those who do not think. It is the lat
ter class that is chiefly to blame for
prevalent unfounded beliefs. Then
again, the Jews have suffered so much
agony, partly on account and in behalf
of Jesus Christ himself, during the
last eighteen hundred years, that it is
no wonder that many of them hate the
very name of Jesus."
lie gave a short but thorough history
of the Jewish, nations, and an account
of the prophisies of a spiritual Messiah.
In conclusion he said : "If I am not as
good a Christian as you, and you are
not as good a Jew as I am, theu some
thing must be wrong, for one redemp
tion must dolor all. If Christ were to
come down today, 1 doubt whether he
would niiike any distinction between
Jew and Geutile, or between Catholic
and Protestant."
