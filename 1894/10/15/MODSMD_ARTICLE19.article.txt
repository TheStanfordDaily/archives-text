The result of the Berkeley- Reli
ance game Ims strengthened the
opinion that the Jleliarice is a stiong
candidate for the football champion
ship this year. Thi* fact should
stimulate our men to renewed effort
during this week. The principal
faults of our team are high tackling
and slowness in getting into line
after a play is made. These faults
must be remedied at once. The re
sults of next Satuday's game will be
watched with interest, as affording
a means of comparison between
Berkeley and Stanford.
