# The
						Berkeley-Reliance Game a Tie.
## 
### 
There was a very fair attendance at
the Berkeley-Reliance game Saturday
considering the fact that it was the
first game of the season. There were
about 2000 people within the gales.
The majority of the hidies as well as
the men wore the blue and gold
The game served to show the advan
tage, from a spectator's standpoint, of
t his year's rules over those of last year.
It also showed that short halves and
lack of momentum plays do much to
prevent the players from being worn
out. The Reliance team possessed the
more experienced and better individual
players and outweighed the college
men but lacked in team-work.
Berkeley started out with the hall
and the east goal, which was a disad
vantage on account of the sun and
wind. Ratisotne kicked off well into
Reliance territory. 'I he ball slowly
advanced to the Reliance fifteen yard
line when Reliance got the ball, passed
it back to Walton, who was on the ten
yard line, and thereupon ensued the
most sensational play of the day. Wal
ton ducked and dodged past the line,
down the field with the U. C. men in
pursuit, and made the first touch-down
of the day. Whitchouse kicked the goal.
Then came Berkeley's chance. By
short gains the ball was driven to the
Reliance twenty-five yard line, when
Ratisotne went around the end for a
touch-down Peiin failed to kick a
goal. The half ended with the score
f) tn 4.
