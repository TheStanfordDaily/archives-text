Although track athletics have
been discussed until ti c subject has
become trite, yet thero still remains
the necessity of urging that some
thing be done at once on the track
surrounding the football field. We
hive been handicapped every inter
collegiate field d;iy by our miserable
training facilities, and this year our
prospects are worsn than ever,
Berkeley is making arrangements to
send a team to New York, while hero
the interest in track athletics is in a

stute of stagnation. Unless some
thing be done at once to bring about
the completion of the track, we may
expect Stanford to take a back seat
iu this department of athletics for
foiue time to come.
