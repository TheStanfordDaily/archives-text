# Farce for Junior Day.
## 
### 
At the meeting of the Junior Farce
Committee, it was decided that the only
step to he taken at present was to urge
the members of the Class of 'DO to ex
eroise their literary ability in the pro
duction of a farce. All Hhose compet
ing must have in their farces at the be
ginning of the second semester. A
committee of impartial judges will be
selectedâ€”one from the faculty, one
from the Class of'os. and one from the
Class of '06.
This affords a good opportunity for
the display of talent, which is certainly
possessed in a remarkable degree by
various members of the Class of '00;
and all those having literary inclinations
should exert themselves for the honor
both to themselves and to the Univer
sity.
