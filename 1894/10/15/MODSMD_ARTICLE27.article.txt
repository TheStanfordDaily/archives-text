The following appeared some time ago
iu the lierkeleyan,
We have a lot of football men that know
a thing or two,
There's little Captain IJensoti and he
isn't exactly new;
We're training lMidley Dean to wear
the trousers Taylor wore,
And we'll show them that the glitter
of that glamour is no more!
CHORUS.
The funny, funny, funny, funny, funny
Stanford craze,
dazzled many people with its big
financial blaze;
If they will come to liaight. street,
Thanksgiving, 'Minety-lour,
Wo will show them that the glitter of
that glamour is uo more!
j[t is quite common for th> se who are
sanguine in expectation to be suspicious
in disappointment ]
