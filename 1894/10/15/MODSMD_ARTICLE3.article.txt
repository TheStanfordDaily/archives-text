in the second half. Renson made the
second touch-down early in this half.
About twenty minutes alter the call of
time, Wyckoff, in attempting to catch
one of Ransome's punts, allowed it to
slip through his hands and across the
j line, where he fell oj it, makinga
safety. Score 12 â€”0. Then Reliance
fought its way down the lield to within
a few feet of the goal line, where on
the third try it went over. White
house kicked the goal, making the score
12 to 12, which it remained until the
call of time ten minutes later.

This game serves to show us what we
shall have to expect when we meet Re
liance on Saturday next. McMillan,
Whitehouse, and Walton, our old
players, who did the star work for Re
liance, are most to be feared. White
house will probably play full-hack here
after This will weaken the line some
what. Sherrard, at end, is a hard,
rough pbiyer, and a good tackier.
Friek does fairly well at left, half-back
Their interference is poor. Walton
made most of his gains by leaving the
interference and charging through the
holes whenever he could find them.
Berkeley's weak points were the in
experience of nearly the whole line,
lack of interference in helping Ransome
to train, and the slowness of the ends in
getting down the field on punt.
Ransome punts well.
