# Friday's Practice.
## 
### 
The practice Friday was very poor.
The men played with little spirit, and
with less apparent knowledge of the
game. To those who saw Saturday's;
game in the city, the weakness of our,
team in comparison is but the more
evident. If we arc to win the cham
pionship for '1)4 the players must learn 1
to combine their action. Independent,!
individual brilliancy will never win
against strong team work. The line |
men must learn the duties of their posi-'
tion, the backs to take advantage of line !
plays. The men cannot expect a coach
or a captain to be ever showing them j
what to do. They must learn for them-!
felves.
It was veiy noticeable Friday that i
the line failed to enter into the plays.
If they held their man, it was sufficient.
The backs have a very dangerous habit \
of running backward in order to clear
the ends. Against a good team such
playing would lose the game.
