# ATHLETIC BOARD MEETING.
## Dr Angell's Report on the Northern Baseball Tour. Some Important Rulings—Much Adverse Criticism—Football Manager's Report. 
### 
The Athletic Hoard held an important
meeting last night. 'l he main object
of the meeting was to hear the report of
the Faculty Committee on Athletics
concerning
LAST SUMMER'S HASfcUALI, TOUR.
Prof. Angell reported his investiga
tion of lust summer's northern baseball
tour, and the conclusions the Faculty
Athletic Committee had come to regard
ing the same.
He said that certain rumors in regard
to the throwing of a game for money,
and also of certain unbecoming conduct
of members of the team, had tiiken pub
lic form in several Washington and
Oregon newspapers. Professor Angell
wrote the editors of these j uimals, the
managers of the baseball teams, and as
in a riy of the club that played with our
team as would correspond. A mass of
correspondence resulted. From the
evidence there is no doubt that an at
tempt was made to throw the second
Tacoma game. Three players were im
plicated. None of them got any money,
because money, in these cases, is not
paid unless goods are delivered. Prof.
Angell said it was an ugly affair all
around, and be thought it best to men
tion no names in regard to it. The
Faculty Committee has sufficiently
passed on the matter regarding those
players.
A newspaper article also appeared
alleging unbecoming conduct of the
players at a hotel. The mauaget of
that hotel wrote that the conduct of the
men in all respects was perfectly
geutlemanly, and he would be exceed
ingly glad to have the men again at any
time. Had the Faculty Committee
known that some of the members of the
University ball team would not go upon
the northern tour, they probably would
not have permitted the trip. As it
was, when the nine departed, the Fac
ulty Committee in substance said, "We
will put no person to watch you; act
honorably in every way; do the square
thing by the University.'- The com
mittee does not think that the square
thing was done, and has decided that
it is best for the University that there
should be no more athletic tours, cither
base ball or foot ball. Either team will
be permitted to go abroad and play one
game with a worthy opponent, but for
any series of games the use of the
Stanford name will not be allowed.
After this report was heard, a com
mittee was appointed to prepare a set of
by-laws. Abe Lewis, I). L. Arnold,
and L. J. Hinsdill are the members of
this commitee, and will confer with the
faculty member of the board over the
drafting of the by-laws.
A motion was also passed requiring

all candidates for either football or
baseball teams to pass a medical exam
ination under Dr. Wood.
The financial report of the football
manager was also received, and is sub
joined.
