Attention is called to the rul
ing of the Fa ulty Committee on
Athletics, which forbids any more
t i.rs by Vaisity teams It may be
stated that the investigation of
which this ruling is the outcome,
has bv en in baud for two months.
It is mote than probable that this
ruling has been meditated fora
considerable time. While this de
cision has been maturing with the
Faculty Athletic Committee, many
engagements base been made
aud agreements entered into
by the managers of our teams
aud clubs. Tlksj engagements
are in the nature of tours.
Because the committee desire to
show disapproval of the a"tion of a
few men, it is absurd to make man
agers break their bonds, eaucel their
agreements, and show up the stu
dent body in the light of a set of
shiftless shutllers. If ever it was the
intention to make the ruling retro
active, and make the teams cancel
tlu-ir engagements, the mle should
have been passed months ago.
