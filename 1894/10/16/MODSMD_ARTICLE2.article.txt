# From the Side Lines

### 
The play last night was much better
than that Friday. The men have ap
parently realized the intensity of the
impending struggle, and put more vim
and spirit into the plays. A good deal
of fumbling is still noticeable. The
men, also, try to pick up the ball in
stead of falling on it. It. is far better
to be sure of the ball than to run the
risk of losing it for the sake of gaining a
yard or two.
Field, at ccnter, has been playing a
good game. He passes the ball well,
and gets through in good style, but
fails to get into the interference. He
lacks the faculty of always being with
the ball, which has characterized Down
-0
ing's play, and made him so valuable to
the team. Burnett, at right guard,
plays a good defensive game. In
offensive work he is weak. Thomas, at
left guard, put up a good game last
night. He broke through well, and
followed the interference, Thomas has
improved over his last year's play.
On the second eleven, Harrelson dis
tinguished himself. He followed the
ball, and tackled well. Hazzard, '95>
put up a good game.
The punting was very good. Soper
drives the ball for good gains, but in
bucking the lino he runs too high and
is iuclined to drop the ball. He has a
very pretty knack of punting on the
run for good gains. McCray, fullback
on the second eleven, id inclined to
kick a little hastily. lie runs well
however, and strikes the line hard.
Painter on the end tackles hard and
with experience will put up a good
game.
