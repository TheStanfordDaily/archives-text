Editor Daily Palo Alto:
It has often been asked by thought
ful students who dine at Eocina
whether the dozen or more " tardies "
ever consider the fact that they arc
waited on by their fellow-students and
that these waiters have study and lccture
hours the same as others.
Some of the " tardies " say, "We
pay for our board," Who doubts that
the student waiters pay, and more than
pay, for the cold hash the " tardies " so
generously leave him for his own meal?
Instances occur daily where the
" tardies " detain the waiters until a
few moments before lectures begin,
when the waiter must so exert himself
to readjust his table and hasten to the
lecture room that, when he scats him
self, he is freely perspiring, and in
danger of catching cold. The student
waiters think it is not unfair to ask that
boarders be more thoughtful.
Student Waiter.
