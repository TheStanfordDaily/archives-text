Casper W. Hodgson has returned

Tomorrow afternoon in the lobby of
Enoina all students who desire may
register for the coming county and
state elections.
A rumor is about to the effect that
Prof. Willoughby, our non-resident
lecturer on politics, may be induced to
stay and take a chair in the economics
department.
At a meeting of the Tennis Club this
afternoon, Arnold, '95, was elected a
member of the executive committee,
vice Kessinger resigned. A number
of amendments to the old constitution
were also adopted.
Last evening, on account of the
burning out of a fuse, the library was
left in darkness for an hour and a half.
A faulty fuse in Kncina necessitated
the electrician's presence there, or the
lights in the library would have been
repaired in a shorter time.

lican Club will be held tomorrow, Oct.

All students interested are requested
to be present, as business of importance
