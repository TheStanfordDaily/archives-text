The J uesday evening lecture was
given by Professor C. D. Walcott>
United States geologist upon the Gov
crninent Geological Survey.
The survey is comparatively new.
In 1849, the year of the gold discovery
in California, a wave of progress set to
ward the west. In 1852 a government
expedition took along a geologist, and
year after year other expeditions passed
from the Mississippi westward, each tak
ing with it a naturalist and a geologist.
Thus California was the cause of the
first, geological survey west of the Miss
issippi.
In 1879 the scattered groups were
combined, and the U. S. Geological
Survey organized. Extensive topo
graphical surveys were commenced in
1882, and now 500,000 square miles
have been thoroughly mapped, ready
for the geologist.
Last year Congress appropriated a
large sum for guaging the water supply
of the United States, both the running
surface water and the underground How.
This hydrographie work, it is hoped,
will he actively going on throughout
(lie West bj' next year.
The survey has also a group of men
<unplojed in studying paleontology;
gathering, comparing, and classifying
the fossils found in the various forma
tions. Another phase is the publica
tion of an annual volume, in which is
brought together all knowledge in rela
tion to the mineral products of the
United States.
In concluding, Professor Walcott
alluded to the immense impetus the
Survey has given to the study of geol
ogy scientifically in the American uni
versities, and the great practical bene
fit the people at large have received
from the economic portion of its work.
