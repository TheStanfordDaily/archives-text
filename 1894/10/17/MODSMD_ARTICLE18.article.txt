The action of the students of
Princeton in abolishing hazing is
most commendable, ami marks a
new era in the history of that Uni

tbo action, therefore, is more note
worthy than it "would be if it came
from a younger and less prominent
institution. It is generally agreed
that the principle of hazing is alto
gether wrong, and in recognition of
this 112 and by general consent as :t
were, tha practice has never gained
a foothold at Stanford* Indeed it is
altogether unknown here, the senti
ment of both faculty and students
being decidedly adverse to what has
been termed a "relic of barbarism."
