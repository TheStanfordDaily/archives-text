### 
The members of the freshman foot
ball team are riot turning out for prac
tice with the regularity, and in such
numbers, as it was hoped they would.
Hut a little over a month remains before
their contest with Herkelcy, and unless
they show much more enthusiasm in
their work, they will be in no shape what
ever to battle on T) e. S with the Herk
eley freshmen, who it is reported are
practicing 1 •-1 ;md regularly. Here
after, if 01 mi h men turn out, the
Tit ' l in will line un against the

Varsity for three afternoons in the
week. This is a splendid opportunity
for practice and should be taken ad
vantage of.
Manager Frazier has been corres
ponding with the members of the Oak
land High School team, and also with
the management of the Hoys' High
School of S. F., and the High School
Athletic Association of Stockton.
Games with these clubs can certainly
be arranged, provided the men turn out
for practice with enough energy and
in sufficient numbers to warrant the
undertaking. Otherwise, no arrange
ments for games will be made.
