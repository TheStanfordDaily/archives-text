# On the Oval.

### 
As on the preceding day, a small
army appeared on the field last eveu
ing. There seems to be no lack of men,
but very little improvement is evident
in the playing. The greatest faults
seem to be those which coucern the
men individually. High tackling and
high running are much too common,
while the scramble after a fumbled
bail approaches the ludicrous.
