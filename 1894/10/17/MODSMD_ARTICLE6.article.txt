# The 						Student Guild Fund.

### 
The fund has been increased in a!
substantial way since the last state- j
meut was made. At present the J
amount subscribed is as follows :
Brought forward from Mon
day's issue $128 "6
Prof. Sanford 5 00 |
Subscribed in Palo Alto 9 00
Enciua Hall 2 00
Other sources and not finally
reported 12 00
Total $155 25
Amount paid in up to Monday 887 25
Paid in up to 3 o'clock this af
ternoon 11 001
Total $98 25 j
This has not by any means reached
the amount required. Several collec
tros have not yet reported and it is
likely they will represent another twen- j
ty dollars. It is not likely the amount
subscribed can be entirely collected.
Every one wishing to subscribe should
do so at once as it is desired to close
the list this week. One hundred and i
fifty dollars is wanted and there should
be no dffieulty in raising this amount.
