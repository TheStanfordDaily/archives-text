# RESULTED IN A TIE.
## Neither Seniors nor Juniors Succeed in Winning the Championship Game. 
### 
The long-looked-lor '95-'96 game
took place yesterday afternoon. Fully
six hundred people witnessed the most
exciting game ever played on the
campus. The air was in coustant vi
bration with the jells of the sympathiz
ers of the teams. The interest was in
tense up to the very last, when the
crowd surged upon the field to witness
the final struggle.
The teams lined up at 4:15 as follows:
'96. '95.
Stoddard r end 1 Lung ford
Mcintosh r tackle 1 Oreutt
McDonnell... r guaid 1 Hazzard
Field center Downing
Campbell I guard r Hurnett
Hunker 1 tackle r Watson
Spalding I end r liussell
Bernhard quarter Code
Hardly right half back ..iiurre'soti
Keynolds . . . .left half back Lewis
<'ochrati lull back Kennedy
K. K. Zion. gr., acted as referee,
Cotton. '98, as umpire, and Frszier,
: 98, as linesman. The teams were
very evenly matched. The '95 team
was strong and much heavier than that
of '96 The backs, however, were
much lighter. Kennedy, fullback for
'95, who his not becu in training this
)ear, showed a great lack of practice}
the scoring of '96 can be attributed to
a certain extent to this. '96 was ex
ceptionally strong in her ends and
backs. It was in the use of these
men that the juniors made their gains.
'95 leads off with a kick to '96, who
by a long scries of short pains drives
the ball to '95's ten-yard line; '95 re
ceives the ball on a fumble and carries
it to the center of the field where '9G
regains the ball on a fumble. The rest
of this half is played in '95's territory.
Time is called with the ball on '95's
thirty-yard line. Score, 0-0.
In the second half '96 kicks off to
Kennedy. '95 after short gains loses
the ball on a fumble. '96 drives the
ball slowly down to '95's ten-yard line,
loses the ball and regains it. '96 kicks
the ball to '95's three-yard lino. Ken
nedy tries to pick it up, but lets it roll
through his hands. Spalding carries
it over the line for a touchdown. Coch
ran misses the goal. Score, 4-0.
'95 now receives the balland by
steady work drives it down to '96's line
just as the time is called. Kennedy
misses the goal. Score, 4-4.
This last five minutes of the game
was most thrilling* '95 realized that
only a supreme effort could win or tie
the game, and gathered all her strength
for the struggle. '96 equally desperate
strove to get the ball. Yard by yard
'95 drove the '96 men back till at last
Kennedy was forced over the line.
The struggle at the south goal was one
not to be easily forgotten.
Mr. Zion, when asked regarding his
decisions, said : "The ball started two
yards inside '96's ton yard line. Four

yards were gained on the first down,
and one yard on the next two downs.
The first down then started on the
three yard lino, and in the next
two downs the ball was carried
to the line. TMs made a total
of five downs and only four yards
gained, but two of these downs were
carried over from the the three previ
ous downs. In the last play, Kennedy
carried the ball over the goal line, was
pushed backwards and fell. 1 blew
the whistle and just then obtained a
glimpse of the ball in line with the
goal posts. Men from both sides piled
on and the hall was lost from sight.
When they had untangled themselves,
Kennedy was found lying partly on the
line with one foot over and the ball not
over. I mention the position of his
foot because, according to the rules,
that, alone would have been ground for
a touchdown, the rules presuming that
when he was standing he held the hall
on the li*je. The carrying the ball
over the line before falling would have
gained a touchdown. The final resting
place of the ball is of no consequence.
These are the facts as they appeared
to me, but, Mr. Frazier said it was no
touchdown. Thinkirig I might be mis
taken, I then appealed to Mr.
who affirmed my decision."
The punting throughout the game
was fair, neither side gaining any
marked advantage in this way. Roth
sides seemed inclined to tackle high.
' r, . c '95 ends allowed themselves to be
drawn in, which might have cost them
dear. The '93 center men did not get
low enough, thereby allowing them
selves to he pushed aside, and bucked
for good gains by the '95 backs.
The '96 backs put up the star game
of their team. Cockran. Hardly, and
Reynolds made a trio hard to down,
l'ield put np a fine game at center.
He held Downing in a manner hardly
expected. In the '95 team, Ilarrelson,
Lewis, and lla/.zard did the best work.
Lewis made a number of very pretty
runs around the end. He has improved
much during the last week. Hazzard,
at guard, put up a star game. He
held his man well, and broke through a
number of times
The playing off of the tie will be
awaited with great interest.
