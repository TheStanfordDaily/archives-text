						Student Political Candidate.

### 
Gilbert W. Wiglc, '05, a student in
the law department, is a candidate for
justice of the pcaeo in town
ship. Several prominent residents of

Palo Alto, including a few professors,
requested Mr. Wigle to contest the
place. Tliis is a good move aud should
receive the support of all student voters.
It is customary fora student in law to
hold this position in almost every col
lege town and no exception should le
made here, when a man who knows the
law, and has the will and personality to
enforce it, can be found in the depart
ment. Every student having a vote
should register even though the only
object should be the support of G. W.
VVigle, '95.
