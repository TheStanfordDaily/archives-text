# The 						'96 Farce.
## 
### 
The farce, "Travestis Trajarm,"
which is to be given next mouth I>V 'lie
Class of '90, was written for class-day
exercises at the University ol Wooster.
As the name implies, it is a burlesque
on the Iliad of Ilomer, and the drama
tis personae includes all the familiar
heroes whose deeds of valor we study
in English J3. The plot of the Iliad
has been preserved in its main features,
but all the accessories are extremely
jin de Steele—especially the slang. Up
on discovering the flight of his better
half, Menelaus immediately "rings up"
the chief of-police to stop the runaway
couple; and likewise telephones to
Nestor to "go up and down the coast
and roust out the gang." These steps
lead to the storming and taking of Troy,
aftd a terrific combat between I'aris and
Menelaus, in which Paris is saved from
defeat by the gods causing a mist, into
which he miraculously disappears (the
greatest scenic effect of the age), leaving
Menelaus pounding at an imaginary
head.
The whole play will be replete
with local hits, and by no means the
least interesting feature of the "show''
will be the "living pictures." All the
characters have not yet been assigned,
but Mr. Ifobert Campbell will probably
act as Cupid, and the rest of the char
acters will he assigned in much the
same proportions. If the play turns
out to be as great a success financially
as if. is from a humorous standpoint, it
will more than accomplish its object.
