The seventh regular meeting of (he
University Science Association was
hchl Wednesday evening in (lie physics
lecture room.
Dr. Jordan gave an account of (he
so called fossil man which has been
found at Paso Nobles. The fossil,
which is imbedded in rocks of the Mi
ocene a»e, consists of casts of (he back
bone and ribs and a part of the pelvis
of some higher vertebrate. Although
it has somewhat the uppearcuce of a
man, it probably is not a man. The
cast is to be cut out and sent to the
University. Perhaps a specialist in
comparative osteology may be able to
decide to what animal the bones
belonged. If they should be found to
be the bones of a man, the discovery
would have a great significance as proof
that, man is a vastly older inhabitant of
ibe eiinli (ban we now believe him to
bo from evidence thus 112 ir discovered
Prof. Karl Haines gave a very inttr
es'ing outline of the work and object
of those who are engaged in the cin
piratively new lield <1 child study
This work it is hoped will uive a more
rational foundation upon which to base
a system oi education.
Prof. .1. P. Smith showed (hat the
wide difference of opinion which has
existed among geologists as to (he age
of the auriferous states of California lias
a reasonable justificalii n. Prof. Smith
has found, by a careful examination ol
fossils from the different localities, that
these slates are not all of the same age,
but that they vary widely in the peri
ods of (hiir foundation.
Prof. Sanl'ord described mag
netic phenomiiion which he had re
cently observed. When a (aut, iron
wire is magnetized there is a twisting
of the wire. This observation appears
to contradict conclusions reached by
the elder Wiedcrinan and Lord Kelvin.
The phenomenon, however, may be
due to the untwisting of a twist given
the wire in its manufacture.
