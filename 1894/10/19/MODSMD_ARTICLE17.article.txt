Student 3 as a rule are not blessed
with strong eyes, and should there
fore be especially careful of them.
Probably no other class of people
are more dependent upon their eye
bight. Anything that tends to
weaken or tiro tho eyes should be
avoided by the student as ho would
avoid disease. Not only this, but
everything possible should be done
by the authoiities to make tho arti
tie id illumination healthful. It is
us bad sanitation to have a half hour
of twilight before the lights are turn
ed on in the evenii g as it would be
to neglect proper drainage. Tho
only d fference is that in tho one case
an iireparable injury is done to an
important organ, with no danger to
life, while in the other tho suflerer
recovers completely his health or
lopes it completely.
Not one student in ten will think

to stop reading at dusk until his
become painfully tired. Neither can
many tulents spare a lialf-hour of
their time t Inn. Arrangements;
ought to bo made by which the
lighes can be started us soon as,
they are needed. The grtat dis
parity between hygiene as it is taught
in our classes and hygieno as it is:
piaeticed in the engine room would
not seem to great, perhaps if some
such revolutionary rei'oim were J
made.
