# The 						Freshen Score Against the Varsity.
## 
### 
The freshuieu succeeded in making
a touch-down against the Varsity last,
night, and later, reinforced l>v several
new men, managed to bring their score
tip to three fouch-downs. The Vnt>ify
tomi cannot bo blamed Cor tins, as they
had hardly recovered from the fatigue
and the bruises received in the hard

fought battlo of the afternoon previous,
in which the majority of (he Varsity
men were participants. Above all,
the first team's center was weak. Dole!
and Soper assaulted it time after time,
with uniform success. It is to be hoped
that with a day's rest our men will be
in perfect condition to meet the Ite
rance team tomorrow.
Lewis and .McCray made by far the j
best, shotting on the first eleven. Dole
.
did finely at bucking the center for the
freshmen. Rernhard, who played in j
lb3 second half, put up a better game
than at any time sinee he been out,. !
