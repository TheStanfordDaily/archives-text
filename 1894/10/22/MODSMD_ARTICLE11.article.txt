Owing to the small amount taken
in at the game last Saturday, it is
necessary for all thope who have not
paid their student body assessment
to do so at once. The postmaster
has loudly consented to receive the
assessments of those who wish to
pay without solicitation. It is to be
hoped that inasmuch as the team
is without funds to take it to Smta
Cruz Saturday, there will be no
delay ou the part of the students.
