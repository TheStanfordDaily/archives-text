At a meeting of the Glee and
Mandolin Clubs held last, Friday,
the amalgamation of the two clubs
was finally consumated. Hence,
forth the clubs will play together in
all conceits. This will not only re
sult in a mutual advantage to both
dubs, but it will also give a more
representative concert to the stud
ents, and will represent the Univer
sity in a better light before the pub
lic. The first concert by the combin
ation will be given on the grounds
in a few weeks, and it should receive
the hearty support of the student
body. The clubs will be in excel
lent condition, and an enjoyable pro
gram is assured.
