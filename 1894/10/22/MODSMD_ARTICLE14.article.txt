# The 						Sunday Sermon.
## 
### 
Episcopal services were held in the
chapel last Sunday morning, the Itev.
Mr. Wakefield presiding. The text
was taken from the 17th chapter ol St.
Luke: "Render to all, tribute to
whom tribute is due, custom to whom
custom is due, Tear to whom fear is
due, and honor to whom honor is due "
The sermon was short and somewhat
disconnected; a good deal of attention
was given to the time honored theme
of the moral obligation of duty. A
differentiation was then made between
duty and religion. Master Turner
sang a solo after the sermon.
