# AN INTERVIEW WITH CAMP.
## The 						Team in Far Worse Shape Than He Expected. 
### 
Mr. Camp was interviewed fur a few
minutes last evening at Escondite.
He said that he was very much dis
appointed in the condition of the team;
lie had expected to find a strong and
ready line to base his work upon, and
had hoped to spend the time between
now and Thanksgiving in working up
backs, but he will now have to use a
good share of the time in strengthening
the line. It would take three or lour
days to get the men in their riglit. posi
tions.
He was surprised to see Reliance so
easily carry away our line in Saturday's
game, and more than surprised to see
even the scrub team break through so
frequently as they did in last night's
practice. The Varsity did not play as
hard a game as either Reliance or the
scrub team.
He was pleased with the work of
Lewis and Spalding on the ends Satur
day, but had, as yet, no opinion to ex
press as to the positions back of the
line. Until the forwards were strong
enough to hold their men well, he
could not tell much of what the backs
could do, as they were tackled and
downed before they were fairly started.
As to full-backs, though he bad not yet
seen any good kickers, he thought that
there was a good chance for finding one
yet, as a full-back was usually late in
developing, but that men should have
been practicing for that position long
before this.
Altogether Mr. Camp wa-t not at all
enthusiastic on the work he has seen
thus far, but he hopes to say some
thing more hopeful after the team has
had some coaching.
It. is yoitig to take some hard and
honest practice to get the boys even in
as good shape as he had expected to find
them.
