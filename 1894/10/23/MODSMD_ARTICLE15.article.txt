Stanford's interest in track ath
letics has been in pnst years wofully
slight. The scheme for putting the
running track in condition will un
doubtedly fcerve to develop this in
terest and to bring out men who
have wanted to train, but have
bicked a good opportunity. The
offer of the Baud to step into the
breach and to give a concert in aid
of track athletics is highly commend
able.
