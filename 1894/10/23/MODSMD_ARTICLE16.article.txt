Aitek the damper put on Stanford's
football aspirations by the defeat at
ihe hands of lieliauco, the thoughts
of all turned towards Mr. Camp as
the only savior from a similar drub
bing by the Berkoley boys. Yester
day afternoon when he appeared for
the first time on the oval, a great
numb of the students turned cut
to witness the practice and to get if
possible some food for their heart
felt hope of Stanford's victory. We
think no one was disappointed. The
very presence of the coach seemed
to infuse new vim into the players.

Evry spectator went away even more
certain than before that if any man
can coach the team to triumph, that
man is Walter Camp.
