# Football Practice.
## 
### 
The practice last night was fair. The
men had hardly recovered from Satur
day's game, and showed the fact in
their play. The men ran high and
put little or no team work in their play.
The line men did not get low enough
and allowed their opponents to break
through and stop their kicks. The
tackling, with few exceptions, was high
and erratic. It is time that this fault,
to which so many of our best and oldest
players are addicted, should be stopped.
Those who saw Saturday's game, can
not but lay part of our defeat to high
tackling, which allowed the 'Heliance
men to stagger on fora gain of five and
ten yards.
About forty candidates were on the
field. At 5 o'clock the men lined up
and for forty minutes engaged in hard
practice with but two rests.
Mr. Camp's first effort will be to
build up our center, and to that ho de
voted his whole attention last night.
Hazzard, '95, was tried for center,
and, fora new man, put up a good
game against Field. Hazzard is a very
heavy man, and also exceedingly active
for his weight. It is greatly to be re
•iretted that he did not come out earlier
in the season. Thomas and Picket t
played guards for the Varsity. Both
men are very active. Thomas makes a
great number of tackles, but is inclined
to be weak in defensive play and let his
man through. lie would improve his
play by getting lower.
Captain Downing coached the second
eleven during the first part of the prac
tice. Later he played tackle, and made
a number of long runs. If a center
could be found, Captain Downing would
greatly strengthen the team by playintr
farther out on the line—tackle, or even
end.
