Tue proposed plan of holding the
coming intersociety debate in a
nenji private mauner has been ob
jected to by sume students. The
objections are based on the grounds
that since tlie intercollegiate debat
ers will, in all probality, come from
the societies, the debates should be
open so that the University may see
just what material is available in the
noei3ties. To this it may be replied,
that the coming debates are merely
competitive contests between tho
societies in themselves. The open
and pubi c debates, whereat the
talent competing for representation
in the inter-collegiate contest will be
displayed, will occur later in the
vear.
