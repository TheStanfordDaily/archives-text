Aoain attention is called to the
condition of tho lire apparatus upon
which we have to depend in case of
lire. Tho hose cart stationed at tho
camp would hardly run a rod with
out collapsing, and the hoso is sel
dom or never inspected. There are
three small hose carts stationed at
different places on the campus.
Their combined service would be
hardly more than sufficient to reach
some of the dwellings at a distance
from the hydrants, and it would
only bo a happy chance if they all
arrived in time for use Then there

ought to be some kind of a ladder
service available, together with axes,
buckets, and ropes, even of the most
primitive kind. AVhen ladders are
needed they are needed badly; noth
ing will take their place.
Should a fire break out on 4he
campus, ns we are situated, not
more than one line of hose could be
depended upon, unless the lire
were very near a hydrant. There
would be hundreds of willing hands
and no implements. Second or
third stores would be entirely inac
cessible, either for rescues or lire
tighting purposes, and serious acci
dents might ensue. We would
then reproach ourselves for our care
lessness.
