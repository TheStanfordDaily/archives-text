# Last Night's Practice.
## 
### 
The football field last night was a
muss of mud after the recent hard
riins, and the players were handicapped
thereby. It, was amusing, at least for
those who were seated upon a dry
bench, to see little llarrelson sink (juite
out of sight under nearly ha!l' a-ton of
weight when such men as Burnett,
Cunpbell, and Fickert tackled him at
the same instant,. All the men wore
adobe masks on their faces and sabots
of mud on their feet iri addition to the
ordinary football shoe. No doubt
"Annie Laurie" of' the Examiner will
have some amusing things to say on
ibis subject, for she was an interested
witness of the practice.
The favorite word in speaking o*'our
teams' play at present is "erratic." Last
night's practice was no exception to the
rule. It was erratic. At times the scrub
team would break through the line at will.
At other times the Varsity would brace
up and hold them down finely, llaz
zard did the best of any of the Varsity
center men, but he had a comparatively
weak man against him. Burnett, as
right guard on the scrub team, played
ast ir game, breaking through repeat
edly, and tackling behind the line.
Cotton proved himself one of our best
tackles. Spalding and Lewis, on the
ends, played their usually brilliant
game. Dole, on each succeeding night,
demonstrates the fact, more and more
that lie is one of our best line buckers.
Bernard is another man who has shown
himself to be a splendid ground gainer
in a scattered fi :1 d. He se:ms to lose

somewhat when starting close to the :
line, Reynolds made some good gains, j
A number of the players object to j
playing so long at practice. These
should remember that this is the one
way the team can be put into shape.!
The coach knows just how much work j
the team should and can stand.
