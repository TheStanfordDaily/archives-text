Editor of the Palo Alto:
I believe it was Benjamin Franklin
who remarked, in a certain connection,
that he "rather approved his giviug
good sermons composed by others, than
bad ones of his own manufacture,
though the latter was the practice of
teachers."
I do not wish to discourage auy of
the clergymen who have kindly given
their time to come and address us. I
think they are very good ministers for
their communities, and that they
preach very good sermons. But
L sincerely believe the hour in chapel
Sunday can be more advantageously
expended. If it is impossible to find
ministers upon this coast who can in
terest university students, why should
we not enjoy, even at second hand, the
truly great thoughts that are coming
from the pulpits today?
1 remember sermons read by l)r,
.Jordan and others on Sundays during
vacation, which were listened to by the
audieuce with far more interest and
profit than many original ones we have
heard this autumn. 0. D.
