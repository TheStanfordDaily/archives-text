# Mrs. Stetson's Lecture.
## 
### 
A fair sized audience greeted the!
lady journalist who spoke in the chapel
last evening. She dwelt chiefly on
journalism as a social function, which
she claimed to he the real position o'
journalism in the body politic. After
a len»thy discussion of the rise and
progress of speech and literature she
gave her views of what a modern news
paper should be. She did not think
fiction had a legitimate place in j turu
alism, nor that all the horrib'e descrip
tions and details of murder, constitute
news. She thought murders should be
briefly treated under the "murder news \
of the day."
As a department of journalism,
newspapers have no phice fur lit* rature
in them. If they choose to print liter
nture and present it as such, all well;
and good, but they should not allow
reporters' fancy to work up a piece of
news to be interesting regardless of
truth. It is a most, important and hon
orable thing for reporters to he able to
give the news exactly.
