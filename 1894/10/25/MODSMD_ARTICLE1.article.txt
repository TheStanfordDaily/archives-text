# Football Practice.

### 
The practice last night was played on
the old field and was by far the best of
the week. The three days coaching is
beginning to show. The men did not
display the looseness and lack of spirit
that has been so general this season.
The players seem to be doing their best
to take advantage of the coaching. In
dividual brilliancy is losing itself in in
terference and teamwork. Mr. Camp
is trying in turn all candidates for the
center positions, striving to obtain
anchor men from which to build up
the eleven.
Hazzard is rapidly improving lie
makes a good stone wall for the second
eleven to run up against. lie is weak in
offensive plays —does not take advantage
of chances for tackling. Fickert played
center for the second eleven. lie is
strong in offensive work; gets through
well and makes good tackles. lie til
lows the ball well. His fault lies in a
tendency to individual play and weak
ness in making holes for the backs.
Field has trim! for guard the last two
days. is a very strong player,
breaking through and tackling hard,
lie is apt to be drawn into the oppon
ent's play through his tendency toward
individual work.
liurnett, and Thomas are playing
good ball. The former is weak in team
work and following the ball, and the
latter in defensive play. The play of
Harrington, guard on the second
eleven, is worthy of note. He has im
proved much during the pist week.
He follows the ball well and makes
many good tackles. Cochran, who has
been laid off fora few days, appeared
fora short while and put, up his usual
good game. Code played last night
but was too much handicapped by his
knee to make any good plajs.
The game of Cotton, tackle on the
eecond eleven, is woithy of special
mention. lie gets into every play and
is rapidly forging ahead of the other
men on the second eleven, lie tackles
hard and low and runs well with the ball,
lie, however, fails to follow the ball.
He breaks through well but is inclined
to stop if the runner does not come into
his arms.
Bern ha rd is playing very well as half
on the Varsity. He is quick, has great
speed, and tai<es advantage of openings.
He is weak in interference. Reynolds
is rapidly overcoming his fault of run
ning back with the ball. He plunges
into the line with force, and is rapidly
gaining the prestige of being the hard
est man on the field to tackle.
