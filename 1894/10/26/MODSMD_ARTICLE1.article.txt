### 
Mr. Ilasßrouek of the San Francisco
bar, addressed the law students last
evening. His subject was "Chancellor
Kent." As written lives of the great
chancellor are few and incomplete, Mr.
Hasßrouck's careful account was ap
preciated.
James Kent, the founder of equity
jurisprudence in this country, the
Hlackstone of America, was born in the
highlands of the Hudson river, iu 1703.
in 1777 he entered Yale. When the
college was dispersed by British troops
in 1779, Kent returned to a country
village, and, finding Blackstone's com
mentaries, read the four volumes.
He desired to study law (Grad
uating at Yale in 1791, he re
moved to I'oughkcepsie, N. V., there
entering a law office. He was indus
trious, reading and abridging many
volumes of law and history. At the
age of twenty-one )ears lie married,
' without one cent of properly, and
four hundred dollars in debt," and for
nine years practiced law quietly, his in
come being barely sufficient to pay his
debts and biij books as fast as he could
read them.
In 1798, at the age of thirty-five,
he commenced his judicial career, and
us associate justice of the Supreme
Court rode the circdit till 1801. Kent
sui passed all his associates iu energy
and endurance, iu breadth of reading
and study, and mo.-t. of all iu s)steu.atic
noting of everything lie had ever
known. Kent was Chief Justice of
New Yoik from ISO 4 till 1811, and the
i.exi nine years was Chancellor, Down
io Kent's appointment the Court of
Chancery was unpopular and rarely re
sorted to. What it. became iu Kent's
hands the world kuuws.
It was after Kent's retirement from
public life, and while professor of law
at Columbia College, that he wrote his
"Commentaries." Compared with
Blackstone's '• Commcnturhs," Kent
was his equal in clearness o*' style and
correctness of statement, and excels him
iu research, and fulness of illustration.
Kent indulged in no dissipations,
iiis life-long fascinations were his wife,
his library, and the natural scenery of
his native state. Perhaps his life work
is best remembered in a toast in Kent's
honor by Judge Story, " The State of
New York, where the law of the land
has been so ably administered that, it
lias become the land of the law."
