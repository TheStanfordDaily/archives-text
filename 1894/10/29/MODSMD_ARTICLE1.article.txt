The game between Berkeley aud
Reliance Saturday last was an eye
opener for everybody who saw it, A
more evenly played game could hardly
be imagined, as most the play was in*
the center of the field. 'J he ground
was dry and the field in a fine condition
for an open game. There were nearly
."000 people present.
During the first half neither side
was able to do much line bucking,
though the Berkeley line was the
stronger of the two. Both sides played
a kicking game; Reliance because slie
had to, and Berkeley because she had
been taught to do so. Benson fre
quently kicked at the second down,
which was, of course, untiece-ss i^, un
less it was done for practice.
Mr. Camp, at the close of the fiiM
half, said that the II. C. line was very
n rung—that Reliance 'could not push
it at all," and that "a line that will
liend and not break i.s all lijiht; that is
the test.' lie said nothing about the
b i c k s.
During the second li.ilf the Rdiancc
line sfiffeied Ujj c » isi lerably, and
neither side was able to make any
Latins in that wiy. The ball was almost
invariably kicked; only a few times did
either side make the five yards in four
downs.
Berkeley's line, s»> far as offensive
wnrk uoes, is very strong everywhere.
I lie guards, however, are not so strong
i>n defensive play, as Smith and Mc-
Millan broke through frequently.
Only two runs were made—one by
Walton for Reliance, and one by Hupp
for Berkeley, with the aid of good in
terference. Berkeley protected her
fullback better than Reliance and no
kick was stopped. The Reliance full
back was stopped twice.
Our teaai needs a good deal of stiffen
ing in the line to do anything with
either Reliance or Berkeley as they are
now.
