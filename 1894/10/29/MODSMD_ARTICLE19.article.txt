A notice was publist ed in Frid*) 's
issue of a meeting for the orguni
zation Â«112 a Woman's Bicycle Club.
Oiganiz ition among the lady stu
dents here for any purpose whit
ivtr has never been very forcible.
This has been due to a lack of some
one who could and would take the
initiative. This want seems to have
been supplied this year. Thisis indi
cated by the smooth running of the
Woman's Athletic Association aud
the formation of clubs among the
ladies for various athletic purposes.
