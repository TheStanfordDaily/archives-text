of Dixon 1 1 is reading of the story of
the crucifiction was unusually impress
ive. The text was taken from John
xix, 38.
When Christ came to the carlh
Joseph accepted Ilim as his savior>
but did not confess him. In this re

1 spect lie represented a great number of
people living today — those who believe
' a great deal more than they confess.
: Deep down in their hearts they believe
jin Christ and depend upon Him, but
■j have never had the courage to confess
T •
Him. Joseph tried to bo a secret
christian, but religion cannot be hidden.
Joseph remained silent on account of
i the .lews; and here again he was like
many people of today—ruled by public
opinion. In the church, in politics, in
almost every department of activity
you find those people whose minds are
1 completely controlled by what other
people think. They have not the moral
courage to utter their convictions in the
face of public opinion,
i Man, in his moral and religious as
pects, resembles tins needle of a com
pass: in the storms of dissenting opiu
! ions ho fluctuates and varies from point
| to point, but in the calm hours that fol
| low he is constant, with mind balanced
in its normal direction.
