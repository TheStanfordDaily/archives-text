# The
						Concert Next Friday.

### 
Tickets for the coming concert of the
Glee and Mandolin Club were placed
on sale this morning at the post-office.
General admission has been placed at
the low price of twenty-five cents, and
it is hoped, as a result, that the student
body will give the concert its hearty
support. Both the Glee and Mandolin
Clubs have undergone considerable ex- j
peuse, and the proceeds of this concert ■
are relied upon to defray such expense
The clubs are in better shape than ever!
I before, constant practice being carried i
• i • *> • ,i
!on since the opening of the college
year. More than usual interest is at
tached to this concert, as it is the first
one given by the combination. Un
doubtedly a large house will L'rect the
I clubs, two of our most prominent col-1
lege institutions.
