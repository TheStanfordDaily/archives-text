# Financial Statement of the Treasurer of the Student Body.
## 
### 
Below is given the statement of the
Student Body linances up to date. It
shows a debt of over twelve hundred
dollars. By what means it has hap
pened that the general student body
have known nothing about the way in
which debts were being piled up against
them year after year, cannot be dis
covered. It still remains evident, bow
ever, that a debt, of $550 has accumu
lated from the three preceding years,
until our credit is bad and the student
b >dy have an unenviable reputation for
careless financiering.
