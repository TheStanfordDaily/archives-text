Fbom the treasurer's statement
published today it will be seen that
the associated students havo grad
ually run farther and farther in debt
with cach succeeding year, until the
credit of that body is severely jeop
ardized. It must be evident to every
one that whatever reflects discredit
on the students as a body, must in
a measure, do so on each member
individually. How the debt was in
curred and why it was not discharged
does not in any way affect our stand
ing with outside firms.
It has been earnestly hoped that
the annual assessment would pro
vide a means to discharge our liabil
ities, and it was made low enough
HD that it would be a burden to no
one. There may be some who can
not alFord to pay even so small a
sum as one dollar, but it is unreason
able to supposo that sixty per ceut

of the student body cannot do t-o. \
