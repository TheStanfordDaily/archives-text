The practice lust night was good
The men limd up (juickly ntid played
with spirit. The line men broke
through and tackled hard. Field made
tackles all over the field} he held his
man well and made good holes for his
backs. Ilazzard put up a good game
at. center, breaking through and stop
ping the pass a number of times.
C!apt. Downing played a star game at
tackle. A number of fine runs were
made by him; the ease with which
he threw off would-be tacklers is indic
ative of the work lie has done this year.
If'Capt. Downing and Hunt meet on
Thanksgiving day, it will be a battle
royal.
The interference on (lie part of the
first eleven was the best of this season
A number of times Reynolds cleared
the ends for ten and fifteen yards. If
he could overcome his fault of running
back, he would put tip a star game.
Ilarrelson made a number of good gains
in scattered fields. lie is weak in
interference and often slow in passing
the ball. Lewis and Hardly put up
good games on the ends. The work of
Cochran is a surprise to everybody.
He bucks the line and holds bis feet.
He throws himself into the interference

with spirit. lie is hardly fast enough
for end work. His kicking is fair, but,
somewhat erratic. The line-up was as
follows :
