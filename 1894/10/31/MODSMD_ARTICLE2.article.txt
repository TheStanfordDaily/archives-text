### 
Preparations for the Sacramento trip
to be taken by the football team and
the Glee aud Mandolin Club next week
are being diligently carried on, and it
is safe to say that Sacramento will wit
ness the best aggregation of talent ever
sent out from the University.
The Glee Club, upon which we have
prided ourselves so much in the past,
is in better shape this year than ever
before, and will undoubtedly make a
hit
If constant and conscientious practice
count for much the Mandolin Club will
acquit itself with credit. Ihe club is
in an excellent condition, and we are
confident, that it will add to the enviable
reputation created by the Glee Club.
Arrangements are being made in
Sacramento to receive the football team
and the clubs in fine style. The team
and tliÂ£ clubs leave here November 10.
The football team will play a gome in
the afternoon, and the musical clubs
will give a concert at the opera house
in the evening.
