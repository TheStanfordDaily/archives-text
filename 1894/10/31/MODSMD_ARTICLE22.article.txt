# The 						'96 Annual Competition.
## 
### 
In view of the fact that a great many
who desire to compete lor one or more ,
of the Junior Annual ehampetition prizes
have spoken to me concerning the ex
tension of the time-limit, I have decided
to set Nov. 21, 1894:, as a final date, |
before which all competitive work must
he handed to the editor-in-chief. As
there also has been some discussion as;
to the manner in which the work should i
he handed in, I take this occasion to
state that each competitor shall send in
his work unsigned, hut accompanied by ;
a sealed envelope containing his name j
and address. This precaution is taken
in order that there may be no opportun- j
ity for accusations of prejudice on the
part of the judges. W. D. IJItIGGB,
Editor-in-Chief.
