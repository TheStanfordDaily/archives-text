# Dr. Goebel's Lecture.
## 
### 
The Tuesday evening lecture was
j given by Dr. Goebel upon the " Geo
graphic and Scieutlie Conceptions in
Goethe's Faust."
The position that Goethe holds in j
science is well known, but his geo
graphic views have as yet received little
attention. Dr. Goebel read a passage
from "Faust," wherein some angels, the j
devil, and the Lord have a conversation
in heaven, arid then illustrated Goethe's
admirable selection of a location of
heaven. In describing the view ob
tained of the stais, the sun, and the
whole planetary system, from this po
sition, the author did not say anything
contrary to the later discoveries of
science.
At the beginning of this century,
J Shelley said that from Geothc's "Faust"
anew life emanated and spread over
Germany. In that wonderful story,!
I much that Goethe had dreamed has j
| been tealized in the development of j
modern science. A remark of Goethe's !
on the geography of America and the j
future of the Pacific Coast, shows the!
interest which he took in every part of j
the world, and his almost prophetic
foresight. It was in 1527 when the!
Panama Canal was an idea; Goethe ob
served that the connection between tliej
two oceans would certainly be made,
but more probably through some of tho i
great rivers flowing into ti e Gulf of
Mexico. He predicted that this youth !
ful nation (the United Slates) will take
possession and people the vast territory 1
beyond the Kocky Mountains, and that,
all along the Pacific Coast theie will
spring up important commercial cities,
with lively intercourse with China, and
in such a case it would not only be de-I
sirable but necessary to maintain a navy I
and provide more direct and speedy j
passage from one coast to the other "
He also predicted that the English j
would be in possession of the Suez Canal;
and that in time the Germans would j
connect the Rhine and Dmube. Goe
the concluded this remarkable fore-j
cast: " These three things I should
like to live to see completed. It would
undoubtedly be worth the while, from
interest in them, to prolong one's life!
fifty years "
