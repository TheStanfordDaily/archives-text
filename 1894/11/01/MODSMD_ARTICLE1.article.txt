The practice last night was poor, so
poor as to create much dissatisfaction
on the side lines. There are remaining
barely twenty practices in which to
bring our team into form, and yet there
is no candidate playing in true Varsity
i'nm, Individual play may win against
a weak team, but Ciin never be of any
service against good team work.
The line still remains very weak, the
second eleven in many instances out
plaving the Varsity, if our line can
not bold the second eleven, our chances
against Berkeley will inde ed be small,
Unhss the lino n.< n bold their oppo
nents the backs uill be totally unable
to form an interference. The center
meii of the second get through fully as
often as the V.tr-ify.
The play last night was characterized
by much fumbling, poor kicking, bad
intei l'en rice, and even worse'.individual
play. Field, Williams, and Harrington,
the second eleven center, repeatedly
broke through and downed the runners
behind the line. The second eleven
bucked the Varsity for five straight
dfiwns and then recovered the ball on
the third down from three center plays
by the Varsity. Code, on the second
eleven, made a number of'brilliant tack
les. lie is placing a most dashing
lie
tint he Varsity, Ke\nolds still clings
tenaciously to his deplorable fault of
i uuiiing hack with the ball; at times
recognizing his fault, he almost stops in
his tracks. lie also fails to get up bis
speed quick enough. Instead of knock
ing or butting his tackier, he tries to
outrun him. Hern hard is a strong
runner, but he too has the fault of try
ing to outrun his opponent. His tack
ling is poor. Cochran hits the line
hard and keeps his feet, but lie is not
quick enough in running. No chance
lias been given to judge of his tackling
in an open field. Downing plays a
conscientious game, but. shows his in
experience in his new position of
tackle. He plays a dashing game, but,
many times Inst night Cotton was his
match and able to break through the
line. Lewis played a s'ar game at end
last night, making two touch-downs
around the end by skillful running and
dodging.
