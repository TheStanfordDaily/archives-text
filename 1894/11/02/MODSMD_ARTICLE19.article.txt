The above paragraph, clipped
from the J Ilia i, of the University of
Illinois, is a fair example of the inac
curacies so prevalent in the college
press. The estimates given will be

have dune work in the colleges named.
As to some of the figures, no sane
man with any knowledge whatever of
the different institutions would pretend

matter of fact, a student can live :is
cheaply at our University as anywhere
if he chooses to do so
