At half-past seven the chemical lec
ture room was crowded with about one
hundred and thirty engineers. Mr. C.
\Y. Dickic, a gentleman prominent
anions prominent mechanical engineers,
had accepted the invitation of l'rof. A.
W. Smith to address the engineering
students here, l'rof. Smith introduced
the speaker in a charming way, and
among the few happy thoughts iti his
introduction lie stated in quitted words,
the aim of Stanford's engineering
course: " Our aim is not to produce
engineers, hut to produce men with
1 irgc capacities for becoming engineers."
Mr. Dickie, who is a man of wide
experience and sound practical sense,
and who has also risen from the ranks to
his present high professional position,
spoke forcibly on the true position in
the engineering world of the rcecnt
college graduate lie made it dis

tinetly understood that it is only the
man of large comprehension, the man
with a talent for grasping opportunities
and seizing the main features of a prob
lem, who can ever hope to succeed.
The man of narrow views, of
methods, is hound to be a dreg in the en
gineering labor market. The speaker
said that is was for this reason that
many youn<» college men were often
discouraged when they found their
scholarly exactness and refined methods
unavailing against the experience and
judgment of an ordinary mechanic,
often untrained and sometimes illiterate.
"With no little force did be enlighten
his audience that the work in a university,
which will win fora man an enviable
reputation as a student and designer, is
often the work and training that de
stroys his practical utility in the draft
ing room. Trie lecturer readily ad
mitted that the college man is usually
superior in every qualification taken
separately, but that his training tends
to make him a man of detail rather
than a man of large conceptions. This
faculty of comprehensive view cannot
be won at u university—it must be pur
chased by each individual separately;
it cannot even he transferred, but must
become instinctive alter many weari
some and costly failures. The lecturer
concluded by concisely stating that he
did not wish to be understood as depre
cating the value of college work in en
gineering, for he himself bad spent
many years in getting an iinpeifeet
knowledge of the subjects in which
every Stanford engineer will he pro
ficient,.
At the close of the lecture
Mr. Dickie was heartily applauded,
every one feeling that the address was
all too short and their knowledge of
Mr. Dickie all too limited.
