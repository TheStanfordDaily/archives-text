Although many feel discouraged as
to the ultimate success of our team,
still there is no reason why we should
not win tomorrow's game. In our first
game with Reliance the teim had un
dergone no systematic training, while
Reliance had received a greal deul ol'
coaching. As a rule, an athletic team
never acquires so high a degree of pro
ficiency in team work as a college one.
In all probability the Iteliancc team
had reached its maximum improvement
when it met Berkeley last Saturday
Our team has improved a great deal iri
the last two weeks, and there is no rea
son why we should not have the heavy
end of the score in our favor after to
morrow's game.
There was a big crowd on the side
lines last night. They did a great deal
of applauding. The east side carried
oil the honors in yelling, as the fellows
on the other side seemed to leave the
cheering to the ladies, who did tl.cir
best to encourage the men.
Hazzurd played well last night, but
at lirst snapped the ball hack poorly.
The second eleven guards se<:iued to
have it their own way last nightj it
seems tc be an unfailing rule that no
matter which of the four men play on
I he second eleven, those two are sure to
get through. 1'owning and Cotton
made the best showing as tackles.
Hardly played left end lie is always
expected to do a great, deal and he sel
dom disappoints anyone. Spalding is
distinguishing himself in a new role,
that of running with the ball. Code i*
playing the most brilliant, -rame on the
field. Ilarrelson played his usual good
game at quarter. Reynolds and Hem
hard made good gains. Cochran has
.»hown that he has in him the making
of a fullback.
