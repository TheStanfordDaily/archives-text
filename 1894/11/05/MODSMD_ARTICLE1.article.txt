# RELIANCE-STANFORD GAME.
## Score, G-12—A Critic's Impression—Some General Remarks—Walter Camp Talks. 
### 
Owing to the fact that a detailed ac
count of the game on Saturday has
been anticipated by Sunday's press,
only a few general lemarks will be
made at this time.
The score of G to 12 is about in
harmony with the general esti
mate of the issue of the game, aud
quite correct as illustrating the compar
ative merits o( the team-work of the
two opposing elevens. Perhaps this is
too severe a comparison, but it is not
far from from bein_r a just one. Kven
to the untaught spectator it was clear
that the Reliance team always worked
behind a mass of interference which
made eaoh play an excellent example of
concerted effort Stanford was pain
fully weak in interference. Two beau
tiful runs were made by our men, but
not by virtue of any interference. The
hacks seemed woe'ul strangers to each
other.
During the entire game there was
very little co-operation between them
in the execution of end plays. More
over, the slowness which characterized
their movements was accentuated in the
eyes of the older students, since it, has
been the speed and quiet action of the
backs which his heretofore character
ized the work of those who have played
for the cardinal's glory. There is one
thing always to bear in mind, and that
is that the backs must net is every play
as one man. The individual playing,
which wai so conspicuous in a greater
part of the game, it must be remembered
belongs to days of old. Individual work
must be merged into the united effort
of combined action.
Mr. Camp talked about the team for
a little while this morning. He says
we are improving—that lie wis pleased
with the work of the team Saturday,
and that if it had not been for the last
ten minutes of play, when the hoys
seemed to lose spirit, he would think
we were coming on fast. The ends
Saturday, ho said, were too slow in
getting down the field under kicks.
The tackling of our men was not low
enough, and our defensive play, though
(•tronger than it was in the first game,
is yet very weak. The center held
well, and the new men at tackle did
good work.
Mr. Camp emphasized very strongly
that the fcionl e'even was the life of
the first, and that it is on thetn that
the first team depend for all their prac
ticc, so lie wants the second team to
play hard all the time. He also thinks
that practice should begin earlier, and
that the men should do more kicking
outside the regular practice.
If Mr. Camp is encouriged everyone
in the University should be, and the
t3am will show up well two weeks
hence, if the boys seize their oppoi tuni
ties.
