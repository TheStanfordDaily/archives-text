# Friday's Concert.
## 
### 
The Grst appearance of the musicul
clubs in combination drew a crowd that
comfortably filled the chapel. IJotli
clubs were given a cordial reception
The Glee Club lias some goad new
material, and sings well together for
this time of the year. The criticism is
to be made that their selections on Fri
day evening were a little too heavy to
be wise. u Mrs. Window's toothing
Syrup" was their best number. In
the other pieces lack of cultivation was
apparent.
The Mandolin Club is strong in num
bers, and played excellently, especially
the " Polish Dance." Their playing
lacks spirit, however, which may come
when more practice together has given
greater freedom.
Abbot made his first appearancc and
d,d very well, particularly with his en
core.
Very few in the good sized audience
seemed to realize that a new song,
written, words and music, by two Stan
ford men, was presented to them.
Perhaps appreciation of the beauty of
the song was too much to expect, but
the Stanford spirit was strangely lack
in::. Mr Harris has accomplished
something higher than paining a few
yards on the gridiron, but his fellow
students were ruber slow in recogniz
ing the luet. Many, however, were
impressed with the song, and predict
its success.
The combined clubs give a concert
next Saturday in Sacramento. There
will be additions to the program, and a
good house is expected.
