# The 						Sophomore-Freshman Reception.
## 
### 
The reception tendered to 08 by '97
la"t Saturday evening was.in every
way, a decided success. Kverybody—
whether she was a eenior or a freshman,
and whether he belonged to '97 or '98,
or slipped in without invitation — every
body had a yood time.
The Kncina gym. was.tastily deco
rated with college and class colors, and
set i If to advantage by masses of flowers
and paluis—to say nothing of the nu
merous pretty girls. The college or
chestra discoursed sweet music through
out, the evening, ai d though it was not
the intention to indulge in any danc
ing, the music and the girls were too
strong a temptation to resist. Souvenirs
were given to the freshmen, little dolls,
tin horns, and jumping j icks, which
they evidently appreciated highly, and
played with in childish glee whenever
they were lift alone. The fophs cariied
candy canes, most of which they left on
the lloor of the gymnasium; the juniors
and seniors carried only their dignity.
Refreshments were served over a
counter by t wo smiling sophs, and the
freshic was beguiled into cheerful in
cohcrency and good humor over the big
bumpers of lemonade, by the more ex
perienced sophomore.
Great credit is due to Misses Wheeler
and linker for the tas'c they displayed
in the decoration of the ball, and for
their great efficiency in getting every
body acquaint! d. '90 set the examp e
last ycarj '97 has shown what can he
made of the idea; it remains for '98 to
firmly establish the custom. Happy
'99!
