### 
Tha Searsville Water Supply to ho Fil
teredâ€”Firo Hydrant Provided For.
Arrangements have been concluded
wherchy the University will have an
abundance of pure water for diinking
purposes. Mr. Hodges, the architect,
has been at woik for some time on plans
for filtering the Searsville water, and
the system will be introduced immedi
ately.
Ibe fy-leni briefly is this: In the
Geld west of Dr. Jordan's residence two
tanks will bo erected, each of 0 >
gallons capacity. One will be used as
a settling reservoir, the other will con
tain a largo charcoal filter, through
which the water must pass on entering.
Arrangements will be mado whereby
the clarifying tanks can be entirely dis
connected in case of fire, and direct
pressure obtained from Searsville. Mr.
Hodges has already placed the system
in operation at the stock farm, with the
most satisfactory results. It is thought
that the plant can bo completed within
a lew weeks, as work will bo begun on
it immediately.
