### 
fleneral Lew Wallace lectured hist
in the chapel on Turkey and
the Turks." There were not more
than two hundred present.
'Jeiieial Wallace has an impressive
personality bur not so commanding as
had been expected from so famous a
soldier and so successful a diplomat
The form id' his lecture was artistieand
Mich as might be expected from an
author of' such repute as General Wal
lace
Ilis bits of description were fascinat
ing, especially so where he described
ihe appi aram-c of Constantinople with
its minarets near and its minarets in the
distance. 'I lie lecturer's intimacy
with Turkish life enabled him to let in
a fl iod of lijilit upon mist of his head
ers on the national character id'the em
pire. His description of the harems and
of the mode of life in thetn was particu
larly interesting. All through the lec
ture the comments of a man of the
world were seen; and his eulogy of the
character and power of the present Sul
tan was the product of a personal inti
macy and a personal regard.
