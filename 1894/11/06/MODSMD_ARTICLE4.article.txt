At a meeting of 1 lie freshman foot
ball team, Dolt*, who plays riylit half
back, was elected captain. Manager
Kmzier lias arranged a series of four
games, two of which will ho piayed
iliis week; one with the l>"ys' High
School of San Francisco, and one wiili
the I>e 1111<• 111 School. 'J hofc with the
Stockton 11h School Athletic Asso
ciation and the Oikland 11i«• li School
will probably be deferred until later, in
order to allow the boys to <:et in >io id
physical trim. Tins prospect of playing
in these g.ttnes should awaken much ol
the enthusiasm that bus been 1 a'• klri
lor the past lew weeks, and should
furnish a needed incentive for the men
to get out and do good hard work.
Without practice there cannot, bo any
prospect of winning fiorn licikcley,
and it is to be hoped that this new ar
rangement will bring added enthusiasm
to ll.e mind-' of ih*• men.
