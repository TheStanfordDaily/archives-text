### 
Prof. Brown delivered the regular
Tuesday night lccturc in the chapel last
evening to a fair sized audience. His
(•object wad "Art in Dress," and the
lecture was above the average on such
topics, as it was not dogmatic lie set
forth no ideas of art or dress that would
not appeal to common sense The
lecturer thought that fully two thirds
of the present ideas and customs of
dress were mere inherited convention
alities, and nor. founded upon reason at
all. The figure should take preced
ence to the dres«, but modern styles
have a tendency to make dress (ir>t,
nnd the figure a mere secondary con
sideration.
"A tiling is eithrf beautiful or it is
not. Its beauty i- determined by the
feelings of those who are most sensitive
to beauty As an animal, man is the
noblest and the most beautiful Dross
may sin against life and beauty by dis
regarding ail visual lines of beauty and
all the laws of beauty. As good dress
ing depends upon the thing dressed
and the dress it-elf, so we must know
the nature and the qualities of the
thing adapted to it 'I he human form
divine may be said to lepresenta wedge.
Perpendicularly it is divided into five
different masses: the head, the neck,
the bust, the thighs, and the ankles.
Toe perfect dress should recognize cach
of these. It should also be as elastic
as possible. Garments should be either
vety loose and light, or draped nhout.
the body it) such a fashion its to give a
clear coueeption of the outline of the
figure beneath.
' One of the commonest errors in
dress is the denial of the unity of the
(Lure, the failure to sec that it is one
thing. Very often the head is thought
of as something entirely different from
the rest of the body, and dressed ac
cordingly. The same may be said of
the upper and lower half of the body.
Clothes should utiiTk an increase in our
visual and vital beauty. The beauty
of the human form is one of the most
beautiful things wo know; but owing to
our vulgarization it is continually being
be-littled."
