0110 of patriotism, which < veiyone
who enters at nil into the life of iho
University bhares, and vhicli is
peculiar to this institution. Com
parisons made in another c ilumu as

to the space devoted to football in j
various c ollege publications, the bar
ometer of college life, show that
conditions here no not abnormal,
and that students really want toot
ball news in football stasou.
