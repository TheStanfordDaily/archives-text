That Siturday's defeat did our rncn
considerable good has been evidenced in \
the practice of the last two evenings. J
Nearly all the men who did not appear j
Monday were out last night and played j
with a great deal of snap and push.
Ilazzard did very well at center, al
though he seemed a little over anxious
when snapping the ball back and often
puts it too high for llarrelson 'J homas
as left guard on the second eleven put I
up a strong game, both agrcssivc and 1
defensive. Campbell, who played left
tackle on the Varsity, made several ex- !
cellent runs. He is so large and stur
dy that he can hold his feet and make I
good headway when tackled by (tic or
two smaller men. lie failed to get
through the line as he should, though. :
Bcruhard was placed at left end last. i
night, and did very well. Pauley, as
right end on the Varsity, put up a
strong game. Jack Reynolds showed
an immense improvement in his run- I
ning. lie used his mm to good effect, !
thus making good gains. Franken
heititer replaced Bernhard at left half.
Kennedy bucks the line splendidly, j
His punting is not so good. Cochran'
alternated with Kennedy, and played)
his usual game. Code, as second eleven
quarter, passed and interfered well, but
si ill tackles too high to be sure. J1 us- j
sell made some good gains. Sopcr i
punted well.
