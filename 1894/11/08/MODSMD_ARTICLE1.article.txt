# THEIR FIRST VICTORY.
## The 						Freshmen Defeat Belmont by a Score of 44 to 6. 
### 
The work done by the Freshman
team yesterday was a surprise to many.
They have had but little practice as a
team previous to the game, and almost
none at all lor the past month. Never
theless , their team work was gcod and
i hey played with vim and spirit. The
Belmont team was quite light. The
players, however, put plenty of life into
the game. During the lust half the
Belmont boys rallied and fora lew min
utes held the Freshmen in good sliaje,
bucking their center lor twenty yards.
The Belmont backs were strong in in
terference but very weak in tackling
Bender, their full back, kickcd exceed
ingly well, at times out-punting Soper.
Belmont scored on a lluke. The
Freshman team had brought the ball
down to Belmont's two yard line, when
they iutnbled, Kcid of Belmont caught
the ball and by a pretty run of the
whole field scored for Belmont, line
work was done for the Bclmonts by
Kcid, (.'arson, Carr, and Bender.
The Fnshman team completely out
classed their opponents in ith players
and weight. Cotton, Dole, Nicewonger,
and I'auly put up a brilliant game.
The low .tackling of our ends showed up
in strong contrast to the high and
erratic work of the Belmont boys.
In the latter part of the second half
Carter was substituted for Nicewonger.
Carter made two touch-downs by very
pretty runs. The victory and general
good work of the Freshman team must
be ascribed largely to their captain,
Dole, lie played a most brilliant game,
three times scoring from the center of
the field, lie kickcd six out of seven
tries for goals
The line-up of the teams was as fol
lows :
