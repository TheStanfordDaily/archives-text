Ir tho TJuiver&ity ran a street
lighting system, tlie limo tho lights
are turned on in tlio evening would
be unexceptionable. Tlie Univer
sity lights are the only ones avail
able for studying purposes, unl'ortu
nately, in the dormitories and li
brary, and they begin late and shut
down early. Students should be
very careful to stop reading when
darkness conies on, until some
change is made, or their eye-ight
will suffer t!ie penalty of abuse.
