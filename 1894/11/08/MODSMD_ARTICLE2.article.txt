# Football Practice.
## 
### 
The football practice last night was
somewhat late and short owing to the
Krcfhuian game. The second eleven
was also weakened by the absence of
several of its best members.
Cochran occupied his old position at
left tackle, Kennedy playing full,
('apt,. Downing played left half, Camp
boll tackle, and 13ernhard left end.
Kennedy put up bis usual game, elicit,
ing much applause. Downing played a
fair game at half-back. lie is some
what slow, but plays with lots of spit it.
He is somewhat liable to drop bis in

lerfercnce, trusting to liis individual
brilliancy.
The influence of such men as Ken
nedy and Downing was seen in the
playing of Reynolds. Under their in
terference Reynolds circled the end for j
several long gains. Me put more speed j
into his play, and f-ccnis to have j
dropped his habit of running back, j
He still trys to outrun his man instead
of butting hi in over or knocking him j
off. Spalding made a number of good
runs; he is rapi lly acquiring a reputa- j
tion as an end t unncr.
On the second eleven Bunker, Rur- !
nett, and Jost showed good form. i
Bunker is still somewhat unfamiliar
with the game, but shows good prom
ise. Burnett completely out-played i
Fickcrt last night, breaking through
easily, and ofrcn getting the runner.
Fickcrt often drops out too soon in try
ing to throw himself into the inter
ference.
