# Last Night's Practice.
## 
### 
That our team can play football when
it wants to was evidenced at several
stages of last night's practice. Again
and again it would allow the second
eleven to work the ball well down the
field and then taking a sudden turn
would run it back again. If the team
as a whole would play a game as quick
and steady as it did in the last ten min
utes, our chances of ultimate victory
would be much increased. The second
eleven played nearly as well as the Var
sity.
Ilazzard and Burnett were the op
posing centers. Burnett put more life
into his playing than he has evinced
this year. He kept Ilazzard "guess
ing," and broke through repeatedly.
Later Williams took Ilazzard's place
and played a strong game. Thomas
worked very hard and was strong on
the defensive. Field is too apt to use
his hands in blocking rather than his
shoulder. Ilazzard replaced Field and
did very well. On the other side of
center Fickert and Harrington strug
gled Fiekcrt played, perhaps, the
strongest game at guard on the field.
Harrington at times played a brilliant
game, but as a rule is inclined to take
his time. lie is strong on the defens
ive but does not break up the plays as
lie shou'd. Cochran and Cotton were
the Varsity tackles Cochran is more
familiar with his position at tackle than
with lullback. Cotton played a strong
in every respect. His running,
tackling and interf» n nee were all good.
Rice and Campbell are the regular
cect'tid eleven tackles. Rice made gains
of three and four \ards whenever given
i lie ball. Campbell's strongest play was
in defensive work. Dole was tried at
riuht end on the Varsity, tie ran well
with the ball but showed great lack of
experience in the other duties of end.
lie should make a good end in time.
Bernhard can outrun anyone on the
field when well started, and lust night
used his arm to good advantage, but
tackles poorly. Allyn and Stoddard
played fairly on the second eleven ends.
Code's tackling was fine although high.
He hardly missed a chance, and made
the majority of tackles for his tide.
Reynolds shows continued improve
ment, hut dies too easily. Franken
heitner played a good game at left half,
and Diwning, who alternated with him,
made repeated long gains. Kennedy
bucked the line and tan through scat
ter! d fields in his old-time form. His
punting was fair. He and Code carried
off the principal honors.
