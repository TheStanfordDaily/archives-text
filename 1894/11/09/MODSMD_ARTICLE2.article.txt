# The 						Week's Practice.
## 
### 
This week's practice has to a groat,
degree changed the character of the
football team's play. The line is hold
ing belter and the men ore learning
how to play a defensive game; the in
fluence of signal practice is shown, too,
in the snappy game that lias been
played the lust two or three nights.
Last night, particularly, thisfjuick play
v as noticeable—tie first team f're

qucntly putting the ball in play before
the second team could line up.
With the improvement in the rush
line, the backs are having a better
show to develop, and they are coming
on rapidly. Kennedy as fullback
greatly strengthens the back positions,
and under his interference Reynolds
has been able to make very long gains.
The interference, however, is yet weak,
and needs no end of hard work to get it
in shape.
Putting Cochran back in his old po
sition has decidedly strengthened the
line—ho is our best tackle, without
doubt. The quick work of Lewis, at
end, is noticeably missed, and there has
been less improvement in the p'ay of
that position than in any of the others.
Our center bids fair to be very strong,
11 sizzard being a hard man to handle;
and the guards are doing trood work.
Mr. Camp's coaching is beginning to
tell now, and it is expected that the
boy s will improve every day from now
on. The next game will be with Re
liance next. Wednesday.
Altogether, our prospects for victory
Thanksgiving day are riot so black as
thry seemed, and after a week's prac
tice with the Reliance team, we think
that Stanford will at least give Berke
ley a football game the 'J9th.
