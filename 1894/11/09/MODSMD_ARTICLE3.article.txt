# Politicians Celebrate.
## 
### 
Gilbert \Y. Wigle, Justice of the
Peace, entertained his political friends
last night. The chapter of Sigma Nil
had cordially allowed the reception to
be 1 eld at their house. A very large
number crowded the four large rooms
of the lower floor. The substantial
part of the entertainment was postponed
until after Prof. Abbott's law lecture,
since most of the guests were lawyers.
About nine o'clock the visitors, num
bering about seventy-five, went into
the dining-room and ate and drank from
two tables lavishly ladeu with all that
politicians relish. Speeches were made
by the leaders of the political parties
here, Messrs. Gilliam and Smith.
Wigle spoke fora few minutes in reply,
'fhe house was then thrown open to the
guests, a few songs were sung and
finally the music started and dancing
enjoyed. The evening was a happy
one and passed pleasantly for all.
Many thanks arc due to the Sigma Nus
for their public spiritedness in giving
the u-e of their receptiou rooms.
