### 
Professor Abbott addressed the law
students last evening upon " Charles
Dickens and the Inns of Court." Not
withstanding the shortness of the uotice
and Mr. \Yigle's celebration, a large
number were attracted.
Dickens, when a lad of ten, was
taken by his father to Loudon. The
father was shortly placed in the debt
ors' prison, and ycung Charles lived
much of his time either iu prison or in
its immediate neighborhood. This is
told us in the history of Wilkins Mi
cawber. When fifteen years old Dickens
entered a lawyer's office in Gray's Inn,
and for the eusuing four years lived in
the lawyers' quarters. The tremend
ous struggle with shorthand, as toid by
David Coppeifield, really took place iu
Chancellor's Court, Lincoln's Tnn.
AVhen Dickens begun his writing, he
naturally related what had been his ex
perience. With one exception (Nicho
las Nickleby) there is not one of his
books that does not deal to a greater or
less extent with law. No less than
forty-six lawyers and lawyers' clerks
are described in his works. Richard
Grant White said of one of them, Sid
ney Dillion, " Next to Jesus Christ, he
is the most perfect character in liter
ature." No one but a lawyer can
thoroughly appreciate the merits of
Dickens.
Prof. Abbott briiliy sketched the
location and history of the Inns of
Court, and then read the picture of the
chancellor in "Bleak House"; of the of
fice hoy in " Mutual Friend "; the solic
itor in " Pickwick the clerk in "Mar
tin Chuzzlewit"; and ended with the
happy meeting of Coppei field and Trad
dies and the relations in the upstairs
law office.
