# The 						Sacramento Trip.
## 
### 
Forty men were hustled out of bed
ut tliTee o'clock Saturday morning to go
to Sacramento. The elubs urrivtd
there at 11:50. A car, decorated with
the colors of the two elubs, was char
tered, and the route of the line was
made hideous by the clanging of cow
bells and Stanford yells.
The football game was calltd at about
8:50. Stanford took the ball, and
made a good kiek-tft". The Sacramento
team then rushed the ball down the
(iold in u manner surprising to all.
They repeatedly went through our cen
ter and around the ends. Our men
took a brace when they saw what kind
of a team they had to deal wiih, and by
a series of good plays rushed the ball
down to the Sicrauicnto's five-yard line.
Then, through a blunder, we scored.
The goal was kicked by Dole. The
rest of the first half was rather excit
ing, the ball going from one end of the
fund to the other several times.

In the sccorid half the teams played
very evenly, and neither side scored.
The Sacramento men prevented oil
men from scoring again by their quick
playing. 'J'liey played a very snappy
game. It is also probable that tin-
Stanford team was too much fatigued
to play its usual game. At tlie end of
the game the score stood: Stanford 0,
Sacramento 0.
in the evening a well filled liou'e
greeted the Glee and Mandolin Club.
The hit of the evening was Field's im
personation, Mr. Abbott sang to an
appreciative audience and appeared to
have lost all traces of dillidence.
Shirley Biker, as usual, evoked a storm
of applause, and was lecalled about live
times. The selections by the (Jlee and
Mandolin Club were well rendered, es
pecially tlie ."Serenade 'by the Glee
Club, and the "German Patrol" by the
Mandolin Club.
Financially, the trip was not a
marked success, but was as much so as
could be expected The football team
lust about $2(1, and the musical
letween $10 and Slo. The football
team had eighteen men, and the Glee
and Mandolin Club twenty-one.
