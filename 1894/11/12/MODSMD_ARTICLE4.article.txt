# Football Practice Friday.
## 
### 
The football practice was oi-c of the
best of the week. More team work
and less fumbling were the noticeable
features of the play. Kennedy was
not out, hut Cochran put up a good
game at full. The surprise of the da\
was the football of Pole 08 who played
right-half in Reynolds' absence. lie
made two fine runs, snoring a touch
down. Dole is a strong runuer, dash
ing straight fora hole and knocking
the tackles over. Rurnett, right guard
of the second eleven, put up the best
center game, breaking through and
downing the man back of the line a
number of times. If Rurnctt could
put more aggressiveness into bis
play, be would undoubtedly be one, il
not the best, of the guards on our team.
Russell has taken quite u brace, and
is playing a fine game, getting into
every play, and tackling his man low.
Webster, 'JJG, was out for the first time
Friday, and played fora few minutes on
the second eleven, lie is a bard and
low tackier, getting into every play.
It is to be regretted that be was laid up
during the early part of the season.
There has been a good deal of criticism
regarding the fumbling on the Varsity.
The fault is threefold: Hazzird is not
certain in his passing, often throwing
the ball over the quarter's head. This
fault renders the quarter unccrta'n as
to where to receive the ball. Hand
son is somewhat slow in getting the ball
into tlic runners' bands, forcing him
at times to fall far behind his inter
fcrenec. The backs, on the oilier hand,
do not seem to be thoroughly sure of
their catches, thus making them pay
more attention to the ball instead of
looking ta the openings fora dasli.
