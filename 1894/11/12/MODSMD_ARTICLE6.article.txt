### 
It is a genuine pleasure to listen to i
such a sermon as was delivered Sunday !
morning by the l!ev. :dr. IJayes oil
Napa. JIo said lie would adopt the I
advice of a friend in tlie University and
preach a "simple" sermon, lie spoke
eloquently and without once referring
t'j notes. The text was taken from
Isaiah, 1, 7: " For the Lord will help |
me; therefore I shall not he con
founded : therefore have I set my face !
like a Hint, and 1 know tliat I shall not
be ashainid."
'J'lie mail who talks in this fashion is !
a man of intense cultivation, of fireat '
purpose and strength of mind, and who !
will sacrifice for right all that he has. j
All ihe heroes of the church had faces
set like flint. The man of unbending
buck-bone is a rare specimen. Five >
such men in your faculty are worth all
the rest. Have you ever seen a man !
absolutely uiiinfiiu need by public opin
ion? They are rare, too.
The man who sets bis face like a
flint will find himself alone in the
world. 1 have known men in mv time
who never had any independent opinions
of ihcir own. Tlicy were men who
walked by faith mid not by They
are like a certirn kind of spider, blown
about by evtry wind; you may see
iheir flimsy webs hanging from firsÂ»t
one tree and then another.
'I he douuh-faced man is a harmless
creature. l>nt the man of God's own
heart will be a man of intense convic
tion. lie will set bis face like a
flint against every wrong and will never 1
consider a compromise. Perhajs no i
man can be referred to as a better ex- j
ample of this class than Martin Luther, j
