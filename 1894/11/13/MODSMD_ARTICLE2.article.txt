The practice hint night was some
what ciratic. ] lie Varsity at limes
showed form but often pla\ed
loosely.
litizzaid was eomewliar weak in his
fUHr-injr, throwing the ball far out <>l
llarrelson's reach. 'I he guatds still
continue to stand too high, thus pie
venting the men from using their bndiis
to the best advantage. Coehrau pla)ed
a line game, breaking through and
laekling the runnets all over the field
'I he I all-backs on the second eleven
j>hi3<d a strong game. Doth ].e«vitt
and Dole mt.de brilliant runs. Capt.
Downing showid the iflVet of giving so
much ef his time to coaching. The
8< ootid eleven were able to make gains
l hrou«>h his position a number of times,
liernhaid at left end is weak, lie has
had veiy little t xpericnee at the posi
tion, Mid is not jet a sure tackier.
S| aiding continues to play l.is game in
go« d si\ ie. Fraiiketiheitner made a
number of good gains, doirg most of
his woik, it must be said, by individual
pla} it l / lather than by strong inter
ference.
On the whole the men arc playing a
good game and show the icsult of Mr.
C;i li p's c< tubing. 'I he center men
have plenty of life and use tl.eir
strength lo advantage. The backs are
rapidly developing inteifcrence and
show more confidencc in the linemen.
Although the feeling of the I'niver
sity is every day growing more hopeful
with repaid to the prospects of the
team, it must not be sii| poml that
such a sentiment exists leeaute the

luen arc playing something like champ
ionship I'uiui. They are not jet play
ing in championship form by a long
way. Yet tlto contrast between the
game that they now are ahlc to put, up
and tlie wofully weak work at the first
of the reason is very marked and very
encouraging. It shows that the men
have lo'h of ioothall in them and iliat it
only needs hard and conscientious work,
such as is now being done, to bring it
out.
