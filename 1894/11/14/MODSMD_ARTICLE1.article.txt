# VICTORY AT LAST!
## The 						Varsity Wins Its First Game. 
### 
The Coast Champions Downed by a
Score of 20 to 0.
This afternoon, when the llelianco
team lined up against the Varsity, there
wore nearly 1000 persons on the side
lines to enthuse the players with the
true Stanford life. To say that we
hoped to win would be to put it too
strongly, but there was not a Stanford
man on the field but expected jthe boys
to give the coast champions a tflose rub.
The outcome of the game was a de
cided surprise to all, perhaps to Reli
ance most of all.
The Reliance appeared on the field
first, greeted by the Reliancc
Who are wc!

A few minutes later the harsh
Rah! Rah! Rah!

Varsity favorites.
Stanford won the toss, and took the
west goal and the ball. Kennedy led
off by a thirty-yard kick to Racine. The
Heliance advanced the ball three yards,
Whilehouse kicked thirty yards, the
ball was fumbled, but regained b}'

advanced by short gains to the Reliance

pushed over for the first touch-down.
Downing kicked the goal. Score 0-0.

thirty yards by short gains, and lost
the ball on the fourth down. Reliance
tried to gain the necessary five yards in
