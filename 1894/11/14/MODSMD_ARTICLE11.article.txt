The game this afternoon will have
a tendency to make us hopeful over
the Thanksgiving game. One rea
son for our victory is in the fact that
the Reliance team went out of train
ing last Saturday and has degener
ated very much since then.
Our team played much better than
its wont, and surpassed all its former
work. One thing must be remem
bered, however, that the strength of
the team is measured by its weakest
point, and all future work should
aim to make its strength uniform.
