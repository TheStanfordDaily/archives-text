It seems that the plans for our
proposed elect!ic road to I'alo Alto
were used only as thesis work for
the electrical department, and then
laid aside If the road were built as
i>i igimtllv planned, by the University,
and operated by the electrical de
partment, not only would it bo of
immense practical advantage to en
gineering students here, but it would
I) i paying investment. May tho
plans be resurrected.
