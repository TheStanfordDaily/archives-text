Tue present Chinese war bidB fair
to be the greatest civilizer in tho
history of the east. China will un-i
doubtedly be forced in self-defense
to embrace the arts and sciences of
the west, and her advancement will
have an enormous inlluence not only
upon Oriental industrial life, but
upon that of the world. A great
readjustment of industrial conditions
consequent upon the civilization of
the largest population in the world
will be one o' the problems with
which our economists must contend J
in the near future.
