The rousing cheers which greeted
Mr. Camp when he began his lecture
last evening prove beyond a doubt
that, in spite of charges to the con
trary, there is a latent football en
thusiasm at Stanford which, when
the proper occasions have arrived, is
irresistible. When our professors
and students join in welcoming the
coach with such heartiness, the team
may be sure that its efforts will call
forth a demonstration which, com
pared with that of last evening, will
be as the opening salvo of a hundred
guns is to the accidental discharge of
a toy pistol.
