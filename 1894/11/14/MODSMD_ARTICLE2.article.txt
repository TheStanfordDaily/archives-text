# The
						Game as Seen by an Expert.

### 
The playing of the men was, in all
respects, excellent. There was but one
fumble, which, against five of the prac
tice the night before, speaks for itself.
Kennedy was the life of the team. His
line-bucking was excellent, and punt
ing good. He kept his feet in a way
that reminded us of two years ago.
The three center men played an ideal
game. Hazzard broke through and
tackled his man a number of times.
Field and Fickert both made two tack
les back of the line. The Stanford cen
ter seemed well nigh impregnable.
The Reliance made but one gain
through this point. The Reliance cen
ter on the other hind seemed unusually
weak; Kennedy made long gains
through it.
The Reliance gained through the
Stanford tackles and between the
tackles and ends. Downing and Coch
ran both seem to be inclined to be
drawn in toward the center. Roth,
however, made good gains. The Stan
ford ends out-played the Rcliance men.
Time after time the Reliance euds
failed to get down the field
on a punt. The Stauford ends downed
the Rcliance backs before they could
start. Cotton, fora new man, put
up a most excellent game. Ilarrelson
used good generalship throughout the
game, sending men through unexpected
points and pushing every advantage.
Frankenheimer and Reynolds put up
strong games. Frankenheimer showed
wonderful grit in his fight for gains.
He made good gains through the center
Reynolds put up a brilliant game, sev
eral times completely clearing the ends.
