Those who weut to the lecture
shortly after 6:iiO last evening to .•>void
the rush, did not find themselves too
early, for the chapel was well filled even
at that hour, and by 7 o'clock standing
room was scarce. As is usual on such
occasions, the time of waiting was
passed in local witticisms A commend
able attempt on the part of one of the
" choruses " to start a college song was
wofully successful. Football enthusi
asm, however, was by no means lacking;
a veritable storm of applause and cheers
welcomed the speaker of the evening.
The address was short and entertain
ing, being full of humor. It was so
clear and concise that everybody,
whether he knew anything about the
national college sport or not, understood
the allusions to the various plays, lie
gave us to understand that modern col
lege athletics have no use for the man
who is all brains and no muscle, nor the
the man who is all brawn and no brain.
The aim is toward a satisfactory medium
between these two extremes. The foot
ball captain has no more use for the
shirk than the faculty, and often deals
with him with less leniency than do the
latter. Football tends to strengthen
the element of enthusiasm and tenacity
of purpose in a man.
He gave some amusing statistics in
regard to the fatalities caused by the
game. The following, he said, were
taken from an eastern journal: One
man killed —death caused by a blow re
ceived in a chop-house over result of
the game. One man killed while run
ning to catch a bus to go to a game.
To show that football is not alone in
causing the alarming mortality of the
country, he quoted the following figures:
47 persons killed by falling down stairs
in 1802, 77 in 1891—in Now York
only. Since 1870, with one exception,
not a year has passed without death
being caused by persons falling out of
bed. Over 4,000 people have been
drowned, and nearly 1,200 accidcntly
burned during the last quarter of a
century, the age of college football in
America.
The lecturer theu proceeded to give
a short history of the game from its
English and Canadian origin down to
the present time. ''Of the future of
the game it is hard to speak. Should
I try to say anything upon that point,
I should be like the man who made a
wager that he could ride the fly-wheel
of a mill. His wife, in ordering his
coffin, said, 'John never knew any too
much about fly-wheels, anyway.'"
