It was the genera! opinion union*;
all wlio saw last night's practice that
the team played better ball than at any
other time this season. The first eleven
kept the ball in the second team's ter
ritory from beginning to end, except
when it was kept back. The men
played witli a great deal of snap and
vim, and showed strong team work.
There was less fumbling than usual.
The chief faults were that tlie men
lined up too slowly and seemed apt iO
get mixed up in their signals.
Cotton was placed on left end.
Kennedy, Frankenheimer, Reynolds.
Spalding, and Downing played in real
Varsity form. Kennedy and Franken
heimer especially distinguished them
selves in bucking the line. Dole,
Leavitt, Watson, Hurnett, and Thomas
did the best playing for the scrubs.
Burnett is playing probably the best
game tf the center men. Thomas
tackled well last night, although from
his stature lie finds it difficult to get
down low enough.
