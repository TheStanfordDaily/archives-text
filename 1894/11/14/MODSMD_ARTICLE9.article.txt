# The 						Football Trophy.
## 
### 
Two years ago the University Club
of San Francisco offered a trophy for
the victors in inter-collegiate football
on this coast. The University Club is
made up of college nieu from all over
the country, who, it is needless to say,
are enthusiastic footballers. After our
first victory over thcU. C.,the Univer
sity Club offered a silver football for
the victor in three inter-collegiate
games between Stanford and U. C.
The trophy is a work of considerable
beauty and skill. It was made by
Shrevc & Co. from a model football
obtained from Clabrough, Goleher iV
Co. especially for that purpose. It is
mounted on an elaborate stand, and
will pass into the temporary possession
of the winnerof the first inter-collegiate
game. The last two games having
been ties, no claim can be made by
either side; it may be many years before
either college can be victorious three
times.
The result and date of each game
played is engraved on the trophy each
year. It is a handsome thing and one
worth many a struggle. To the victors
belong the spoils, and he that goes
down into the battle has no greater in
terest in it than the mass of students
who anxiously wait and hope for vic
tory.
