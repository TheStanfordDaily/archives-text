# STUDENT BODY AFFAIRS.
## A 						Statement that Will Help to Clear Up Matters. 
### 
Owing to numerous inquiries in re
gard to the organization of the student
body, the following short explanation is
offered.
The object of the Associated Stu
dents is the general supervision and
control of matters of interest to the stu
dents as a whole. All students are
members in equal standing.
Its officers are a president, secretary,
treasurer, executive committee, athletic
committe, the board of control of the
Daily Palo Alto, and the various of
ficers of these various departments, as
team managers aud captains, managers
and editors of college papers, etc.
Tne president is ex officio member of
executive and athletic committees, and
performs the other offices usually de
volving ou such a position, as does also
the secretary. The treasurer is respon
sible to the executive committee for all
t he finances of the organization. lie
receives all incomes from games, annual
dues, etc., directly, and with the advice
of the president advances such sums to
managers as ex geucies may require.
All sums amounting to $l(jO or more
must be deposited in the bank at the
j tint credit of the president and treas
urer; and their consent must be obtained
by any manager in order t > contract
liabili'ies exceeding $500
The Executive Committee lias gen
eral supervision of everything. It
brings measures before the Student
I tody to be acted upon, aud audits the
accounts of the Treasurer.
The Athletic Committee consists of
representatives from each class, the
president, and managers of the various
trains —fourteen in all. It is divided
into sub committees who act in conjunc
tion with managers in charge of various
departments. It also has a committee
to audit the accounts of athletic man
agers. In conducting actual financial
operations, vouchers are obtained for
expenditures and form the basis of aud
iting hy the various committees. To
each voucher is appended the following
statement:
I ORRTiFY that the above account is
correct; that the articles herein enum
erated have been received, or services
performed; that they were necessary
for, and have been or will be applied to
the purposes of the Associated Stud
ents ; and that, to the best of my
knowledge and belief, the prices paid
were reasonable and just. |»Signcd.|
It is inteuded to conduct affairs on a
strictly economical plan, yet not to a
degree of penuriousness; for some sug
gestions received, if acted upon, would
drive athletics from our teams and our
chances of victory with them.
Some objection has been received
about the Reliance Athletic Club re
ceiving the major share of the gate re
ceipts and the following explanation
may be of service. j he coast athletic
clubs, having no great Thanksgiving
game, invariably conduct their football

| at a great loss. The Olympic Club was
forced to withdraw from the association
on this account. And in order to in
duce the Reliance Club to put a team
in the field and thus afford the two uni
versity teams the valuable practice of
such coutests, it was jointly agreed by
the managers for both universities that
Reliance should have extra induce
ments.
The following incomplete list of old
liabilities is published. These claims
have occurred largely on account of un
successful seasons in athletics. Under
the old constitution the irresponsibility
of any one person for the finances as a
whole made the accumulation of debts
possible. When profits were made on
I any season the manager considered him
j self irresponsible for the debts of his
predecessor and invested the proceeds
in a way best calculated to bring him
self the most renown. These claims
have been contracted for by persons
legally representing the student body,
and it devolves on us to make them
good.
