About a week ago, when it whÂ« j
announced that Berkeley intended
to play lier second eleven against
Reliance, a statement appeared in
the city papers that Reliance was
very much dissatisfied with its treat
ment by the universities. It was j
sniil that the latter were not willing j
to acknowledge Reliance's superi
ority, but instead made .excuses,
which detracted from its well-won
glory. Whatever cause Reliance |
had to resent Berkeley's attitude, it j
is difficult to see why Btanfotd should '
have been included in the condemna
tion. Our very best team was sont
ng-iiust Reliance each time, and the;
ouly comment we made was that our

team was weak; no one said it was j
uot our best. Stanford men united
in praise of the perfect team work of
Reliance. The charge of unjust
treatment was baseless as far as
Stanford was concerned.
