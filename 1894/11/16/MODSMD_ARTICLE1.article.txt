The Varsity team failed to do as well
last night as in Wednesday's game or
Tuesday's practice. This was due un
doubtedly to the fatigue and bruises re
sulting to the Varsity men from the
hard work of the preceding day. On
the other hand, the second eleven was
fresh from a day's rest and in the
early part of the game made repeated
gains, which finally resulted in a touch
down. Frankenheimer, llarrelson, and
Spaldmg were not on the field. This
in itself weakened the Varsity consider
ably. The men braced up as the play
progressed and did much better work.
The weakest point and the one
through which most of the second
eleven gains were made was between the
Varsity right tackle and guard. The
cause of this probably was that Down
ing, who has bad a bad knee for some
time, could not get, around as quickly
as usual.
llazzard at center failed to jilay as
fine a game as he did against Reliance
on Wednesday. Harnhisel, '93, who
did graduate work and played center at.
Cornell ast year, opposed him and did
wink. Rurnett took Hazzard's
place during pall of the time and did
very well.
The guards did about as usual. They
seemed to find it about as much work
k» stop the serub guards as to hold the
lieliatice men. Fickert was in every
play hut tack led so high as not to be
