Eveiiy seat in the theater hired by
IJ. C. is engaged for Thanksgiving
night, while many of our seats are
>et unreserved. Is there not induce
ment enough in the thought of see
ing our foot ball heroes in the pros
cenium box, in dress suits and
chrysanthemums, to sell a theater
section? 'l hen Ihire is the ever-fas
ciuating soubrette in cardinal, for
those whose fancy soars abovo tbe
more stable attractions of the strong
minded co-ed. Besides all this,
ihinlc of the mines of intellect to be
found in such a classic production
hs "Dud's Boy." The theater by
all means!
