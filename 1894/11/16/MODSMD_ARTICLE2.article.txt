# The 						Law Lecture.

Mr. Charles Page of San Francisco
addressed the law students last evening
upon " ftxtradition, and the Kzeta
Ca«e." The talk was unusually inter
esting from the fact that Mr. Page was
one of the counsel who were able to
secure the freedom of General Kzeta.
The trend of his remarks was as fid
lows:
Anciently, oppressed slaves, defeated
soldiers, and criminals sought and
found u safe asylum within the en
closure of temples; now they find it in
u foreign land. The reason is, that but

one sovereign can exist in any one land,
and to surrender fugitives on demand
would be acknowledging the sover
eignty of the demanding government.
Usually, however, nations have ar
ranged in friendly neighborliness and
as good policy in diminishing crimes, to
deliver up to each other, upon request,
manifest criminals. Political offenders
they do not surrender, because it it im
possible for an alien nation to judge
whether the so-ealled offender was
really wrong, and because receiving
him is not the same as adding another
to its criminal population. Such men
do not flock to our centers of vice or
plot against our government.
The Ezeta case is one of the most
noteworthy and valuable that has oc
curred in many years. General Ezeta,
commander-in-chief' of the army of
Sati Salvador, endeavored to suppress a
revolt against the established govern
ment. The uprising was successful,
and therefore that which was a rebel
lion became a revolution. General
Ezeta sought safety on the U S.S. J3en
nington, which steamed north. At
Acapulco, Mexico, the General wished
to be landed, but the captain refused to
doso, in this obeying dispatches he there
received from Washington. At San
Francisco he was arrested by the U. S.
niarshall, the new government of Sin
Salvador (which in the meantime had
been recognized by ours) desiring to ex
tradite him on a charge of murder.
When the case was heard by .Judge
Morrow, Mr. Page claimed that, as
General Ezeta was detained against his
will from the time the Hennington
reached Acapulco, he was really a pris
oner, and so could not be esteemed as
one who had fled to our land in the
sense the treaty contemplated. There
fore he was not >ul ject to extradition.
Judge Morrow, however, ruled we
could not g'» behind the marshall's re
turn, which stated that the General
had been found according to the treaty's
sense within the jurisdiction of the
United States,
Rut as it was moved that General
Ezsta's offence was of a purely political
nature, upon the merits of which out
side nations have no jurisdiction, the
request of San Salvador was refused.
