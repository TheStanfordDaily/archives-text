It might not be a bad idea for
some of the professors particularly
interested in ichthyology to avail
themselves of Lagunita's quiet
depths for experimental fish culture
purposes. Such a departure might
be made to serve a number of use
ful ends. For instance, the disciples
of Isaac Walton among us would im
mediately raise Boat Club stock
above par. Then, again, in the ab
sence of private cooking facilities,
most of the catch would undoubt
edly find its way into some profes
sorial kitchen or other, to the great
sweetening of the professorial class
room temper. If the finny popula
tion ever became too large, the sur
plus could be led off through irrigat
ing ditches to the University farms,
where it would form a valuable fer
tilizer The suggestion at leant
might be considered.
