# Tickets for the Theatre Party.
## 
### 
Every Stanford man should be in the
California after the big game. The
only way to do so as to secure a seat at
once from the agent on the campus. II
the team is defeated the fellows should
rally up at the theatre and support,
theuij if the game should chance to be
ours, there is no more fitting place to
shower honors ou the team than at the
theatre party.
