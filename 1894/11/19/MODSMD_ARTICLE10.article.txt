# Sunday Sermon.
## 
### 
On account of the athletic celebrity
of the reverend gentleman who was to
have preached the Sunday sermon, an
unusually large congregation was pres
ent. J)r. Jordan explained, however,
that on account of sickness Mr. Gill
would not be present, and that, he had
late that morning asked Mr Michener,
secretary of the Inter-collegiate Y. M .
C. A., to give a talk instead.
Mr. Michener said that the Inter
collegiate Christian Association was the
greatest student movement known.
Previous to the student movement the
leaders and organizers had been busi
ness men. Now over oUO colleges have
Y. M C. As in them, more thau
three times the number of any other
one organization, and the movement has
spread all over tlie world. It stands
today for the best there is in the life of
the student. It stands for something
more than this; it stands for Bible study.
The student who graduates from a
great institution without a fair knowl
edge ol the Bible has half an educa
tion.
Nearly every part ol the business
world is over crowded. Business men
are failing on every hand, and few men
pursue the calling for which they pre
pare. Yet one-fourth of the pulpits
of this country are vacant for want of
earnest, religious men to (ill them. The
missionary lield also offers a great op
portunity toyouug men.
