# The 						Concert Friday.
## 
### 
11 err August Aaruold played before
a very meagre audience on Friday even
ing. There had been some misunder
standing in the arrangements; he ex
pected to be assisted in the program by
some of the college organizations. This,
together with the coldness of the audi
ence, tended to mar Ilerr Aamold's
execution. Many artists have remarked
that they have been chilled by the re
ception given them by a Stanford audi
ence.
In many respects the conccrt was a
charming one; some of the selections
were executed admirably. The quality
of several of the numbers detracted
from the beauty of the program to some
slight extent, but not enough to mar in
any way the general impression of the
evening's entertainment.,
