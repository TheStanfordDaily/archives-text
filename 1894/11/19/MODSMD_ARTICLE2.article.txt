# The 						Practice on Saturday.
## 
### 
The teams lined up earlier than
usual on Saturday. Walter Camp was
away, as were Walton and Whitehouse,
so that there was no systematic coach,
ing. The men seemed to take advant
age of this by "taking tilings easy,"
especially the second eleven men. The
Vfirsify had everything its own way ?
carrying the other team down the tield
>it will. McMillan and Raruhhel
played with the second eleven, and did
good work. Thomas played tackle for
the scrubs. He is not familiar with
the position, but did very well. Burnett
did more tackling than any other cen
ter man. The first team's backs all
made good gains, as did Spalding on the
end llarrelsou showed great im
provement iri his interference. Watson
made a great many tackles but he
tackles so high he is nor. at all sure
One noticeable fault in the placing of
ilie teams as a whole was that in a play
in which everyone should take a hand
there would be five or six men who
were not in it at all.
