# Special Rates for Stanford.
## 
### 
Arrangements have been completed
fur the Hand concert in the court of
the Palace Hotel on the evening of the
Thanksgiving football game.
At the same time arrangements were
made fora special rate to Stanford pro
fessors and students for that day. This
rate has since been made permanent
and is now in effect and will continue
during the year. The rate, in consid
eration of the high rank of the Palace,
is extremely low and makes it possible
for every one to take advantage of the
pleasant accommodations.
Heretofore Stanford has never bad
any definite headquarters, as is custom
ary with U. C. and other universities,
and this seems to be a good opportunity
to introduce such a plan, especially
since the football management desires
that general and team headquarters be
separate.
Recently the assistant manager of the
hotel said, " 1 want Stanford people to
feel that this is their headquarters in
San Francisco." This attitude, coupled
with the fact that the rates apply only
to the rooms, leaving one free to secure
meals either at the hotel or in San
Francisco's many excellent restaurants,
seems very reasonable.
Terms may be learned by inquiring
of Miss Thompson at lloble, Air. Entler
at Eneina, or at the registiar's office.
