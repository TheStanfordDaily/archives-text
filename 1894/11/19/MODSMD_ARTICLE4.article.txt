# Bench and Bar.

### 
The Bench and Bar met Friday
evening. The argument was made on
the following facts: " John Brown
deeded to his wife a piece of real estate
and had tho deed recorded. Six months
later ho embarked in a mining enter
prise, as a result of which be became

financially embarrassed. Ilis creditors
bring a bill in equity to have the deed
to the wife set aside on the grounds
that the deed was made to defraud
creditors. 1c is admitted that, at the
time of making the transfer of the land,
John Brown did not contemplate enter
ing into this particular mining scheme,
but lie did expect to engage in some
other hazardous business, but for some
reason failed to do so." Ilinsdill and
Frost argued for the plaintiff, and
Gilliam and Ilerrick for the defendant.
The Bench was composed of Folsom,
chief justice; Charier, Crothers, Rey
nolds, and llose, associate justices.
Before the regular session the de
cision in the patent-medicine case was
rendered. The majority of the Court
decided that the plaintiff could not re
cover. The leading opinion was written
by Ilinsdill, and concurred in by Frost
and Hcynolds. Herrifk and Folsom
read dissenting opinions. As the Court
was so even y divided in this case, an
appeal will probably be taken to Prof-
Abbott.
