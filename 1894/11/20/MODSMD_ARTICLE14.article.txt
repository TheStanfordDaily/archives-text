Only six practices remain for the
football men before the big game.
What can be done by n team in six
days remains for our men to deter
mine. At present our chances are
questionable; considering the stake
to bo fought for all interests should |
be merged in one determined week i
of training and conscientious effort.
The athletic prestige, present and
future, is at stake. Three years of
the teams labor is to be won or lost;
the hopes and the desires of a score
of a thousand sympathizers are to be
realized or disappointed. All the
patriotism in the University is cen
tered 011 the outcome of the game,
and any misfortune to the team is a
misfortune to all. Our heroes are
the football heroes, and their success
is ours as is their defeat. Captain
Downing ! the University suprem
acy is in your keeping.
