Why the Sophomores should deem j
it wise to give their hop in the 1

j second semester is a mystery. Dur
ing tho first term there is no great
eveut outside the football game;
| social opportunities are very few.
In the second ha'f-year.ou the other
hand, there are junior and senior
farces, Memorial D.iy celebration,
1 Commencement, and other social
affairs It seems that a change of
the elate of tho hop from February
! to some time this semester would
| meet with general approval. .lust
before Christmas vacation would be
an opportune time.
