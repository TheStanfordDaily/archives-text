The realization of the nearness of
the game was apparent in the play of
the team last night,. All the men devoted
themselves to perfecting their deficien
cies. More team work arid interference
were used than usual. The men lined
up (juickly and played with more spirit
and vigor. During the early part of
the practice the Varsity lined up
against a mixed Freshman eleven, and
in about fifteen minutes scored two
touchdowns. After a short rest the
Freshman team was replaced by the
regular second eleven,
llazzard put up a brilliant game at
center, breaking through a number of
times and bringing the second eleven's
center plays to a dead halt. Field and

Fickert pat up good games. Burnett
at times seemed to out-play Fickert in
the defensive work of the Varsity.
Cochran and Capt. Downing were in
every play, tackling the runners all
over the field Downing made two
long runs. Spalding and Cotton were
in good form, although Cotton is liable
at times to be drawn in.
The interference of Ilarrelson was
the feature of the practice. lie inter
fered for Kennedy in line style, knock
ing a would-be tackier off his feet.
His tackling was also good. Reynolds
and Frankenheimer played strong
games. I'he endurance and pluck
shown by Frankenheimer is wonderful
He plays his hardest game at. all times,
doing much more than his share of
tackling. Kennedy is rapidly getting
into form, lie bucks the line and runs
in magnificent style. His tackling is
low, but somewhat weak. A week's
practice will improve him wonderfully.
Code was out last night, and put up
a strong game. Leavitt and Watson
made two long runs for the second
eleven. J3oth of these men have made
great improvement during the past
week.
