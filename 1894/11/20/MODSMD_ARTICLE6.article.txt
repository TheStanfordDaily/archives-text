Class of '95 Gets Bills for Goods Never
Received.
The Class of'95 has receive ! at dif
ferent times from Sanborn, Vail & Co.,
San Francisco, three bills, each stating
that the class owes that tirm &2.'28.
The first bill received is as follows:
San Francisco, May 10, 189 â€” i
Stanford University, Class of '95.
Bought of Sanborn, Vail & Co.,
741, 743, 745 Market Street.
12 Sheets What. I). E. Draw, paper .$1 88
1 Pt. Arnald's Fluid 40
*2 28
Duplicate Bill.
By Request
Just what is meant by "D. E. Draw
paper " is a bit hard to tell. The class
officers have no knowledge of any such j
purchases from Sanborn, Vail & Co., i
and the account was evidently opened
by some irresponsible and dishonest
student who undertook to shift the
burden of paying fur his drawing
materials from himself to the .of
'95.
The second bill is simply a state
ment of account. The third, dated
Nov. 1, 1894, has written at the bot
tom, "We do not think this should
be kept standing so long. We shall be
compelled to forward it to the faculty
unless settled."
This is a matter which '95 should
thoroughly investigate. This is not
the first occasion in college history that
class credit has beeu used by scamps to
their individual advantage; it is high
time that a strong sentiment be aroused
against any further commission of such
an offence.
