## 
### 
Next Monday evening in the chapel
Blind Tom will give a concert under
the auspices of the Orchestra. Blind
Tom has not been on the Pacific Coast
lor eighteen years. lie is as great a
marvel as he was when lie took Cali
fornia by storm in 187(3. lie is now
forty-five years of ago, and though his
performance on the piano is marked by
great skill, accuracy, and expression, be
is in everything but music as simple as
a child of five.
Blind Tom has been aptly termed a
human phonograph. Whatever sounds
he bears, he can reproduce on the piano,
and once having played a thing, he
never forgets it. In San Francisco
musicians played difficult selections of
their own composition such as a student
of music would have to study weeks to
master. Tom would stand at theirsidc
listening and at the finish of the piece
would sit down and repeat it note for
note.
'ihe Glee Club will get some of
our best known local musicians to play
at Tom's concert so that an opportunity
will be given to test the negro's powers
of mimicry.
Prices of admission fifty cents, re
served seats seventy-five cents.
