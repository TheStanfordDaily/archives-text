## Factions at Workâ€”Political Spirit Prevalent. 
### 
A large crowd attended the Student
Hdy meeting this afternoon. Wires
had been red hot all the morning. This
early beginning of political life here
augurs well for the year's business.
The principal business of the day
was the election of two fieshmen to serve
on the Daily Palo Alto Hoard of
Control. Frazier was nominated by
Saudwick; Monihan by Fleming;
W. 11. Irwin by K. II Johnson; Dole
by Grunn. The vote was as follows:
Frazier 94, Dole 84, Irwin 79, Monihan
25. Frazier and Dole were declared
elected.
The next business was the considera.
tion of the advisability of making the
Hand a further allowance for expenses.
Gregory, '96, moved that the sum of
$'S5 be allowed the Hand over and above
the ain >unt vo'ed them some time ago
by the Athletic Hoard
Frazer, '9.0, rose to enquire the
amount already voted the Hand, S.W.
Collins stated that the sum already
voted amounted to over 8100, and that
eonsidering the present state of our in
debtedness it would be unwise to incur
further liabilities, until some means
was at hand to pay off debts of three
years standing.
At this point CiSilliatu, '9(5, rose and
said that the members of the Athletic
Hoard were quite competent to take
charge of the present business, and had
already passed upon it, and therefore he
thought that their allowance should be
considered final.
Ilosendale, '9.'), pointed out, that if
this amount be not allowed the Band,
the individual musicians would have to
pay for such things as a special street
car, decoration of instruments and car,
and also for cleaning instruments.
A. H. Rice considered that the Hand
should pay its own way as did each of
the students not members of the Hand.
Calhoun, '95, said that every stu
dent does not go up to the city expect
ing to be a shining light in honor of the
University, but that it was expected
that the Band would redound to Stan
ford's glory, and therefore considered
that the amount should be allowed.
The motion was put, and lost by a
vote of 104 to 74.
