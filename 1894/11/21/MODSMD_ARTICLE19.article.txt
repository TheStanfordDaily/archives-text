Thobe who expect to secure busses
and cirriages for tho game in San
Francisco Thanksgiving day should
make immediate arrangements. Em
missaries from U. C. have deen do
ing missionary work among the liv
ery stables and hotels there fora
week. The fraternities here have
also completed their arrangements
as to conveyances in the city. By
Monday there will not be a bus or
carriage in San Francisco unen
gaged. If Stanford would not be
outdone in this respect, she should
act at once.
