# The
						Last Public Practice.
## 
### 
The crowd which collected on the
oval last niÂ«rht to give the team a send
< flf before leaving for its new training
quarters, rivaled the crowd which wit
nessed the Reliance game, both in size
and enthusiasm. The Band was out
and did much to add to the general
noise and inspire the players. Its
playing was excellent. Surely no team
ever received more of an ovation at a
practice game than did ours yesterday.
They will go to their new quarters now,
feeling that they have the best wishes
and sympathy of every member <>112 the

University, and will do their best to re
tain this.
The practice itself was rather disap
pointing in some respects. The Var
sity team did not play with us much
spirit and evenness as it should. It was
evidently an "off day"for them. The
second eleven kept the ball well in the
Varsity's territory and would have
scored if it had not been for the fumb
ling between the center and quarter
back. This was very costly at times.
The second team's advantage rested
chiefly in the fact that fresh men were
added very often and that Camp and
Whitehouse devoted most of their time
to coaching them.
Downing made the best pains for his
side, making at least five yards nearly
every time he was given the ball. Ken
nedy and Reynolds also made fine gains.
Harrelson showed remarkable improve
ment, in tackling and running interfer
ence. The rest of the men played
about, as usual. Field seemed unable
to hold his man as he should. Code
was tried at end. He is not at all
familiar with the position and it is
rather doubtful if he can play any other
position as well as quarter. Thomas
played center on the second team.
There was entirely too much fumbling
between Allyn and him. It is difficult
to place the blame in a case like this,
but it was probably due to Thomas' lack
of practice Towards the end of the
game McMillan, Walton, and "White
house played with the scrubs.
As a whole the most noticeable faults
were the slowness in lining up, and the
failure of the men to be in the plays.
