# The 						Steam Power Behind the University.
## 
### 
The power-houses behind the quad
rangle are fitted up with three engines,
the largest being of 250 h. p., the next
of 130 h. p., and the third of 100 h. p.
The largest engine runs the four electric
dynamos. This engine was built for
the University last year by VV. T. Gar
ratt & Co. of San Francisco, and is of
the Pittsford-Corliss type. The positive
slide motion of the valve mechanism is
new and most satisfactory.
The 130 h. p. engine is of the Syra
cuse Straight Line type, and is an emer
gency engine. It has proven itself
capable of handing the entire light
plant unassisted.
The smaller engine is of 100 h. p.,
and is used mostly for shop work. It
is connected with the main driving
shaft, as,'are the other engines, so that
a total of nearly 500 h. p. can be
thrown into that shaft on occasion.
The machinery in the shops is not
run directly by steam power, but
through the medium of a dynamo and
elcctric motor. The day engine, which
runs this dynamo, is started about 2
p.m. and continues its work till 5. It
also runs the printing machinery of the
Daii.y Palo Alto press room.
The average coal consumption this
year will be about six tons daily. Prob
ably 1200 tons will be used during
the entire year, which will be a saving
of 300 or 400 tons over last year. This
saving is owing to the new economizers
lately placed on the boilers.
The dormitories and quadrangle are
heated by steam from the power house,
conveyed in asbestos-covered pipes
through tunnels, which contain also the
electric and telephone wires. Much of
the cooking in the hall kitchens is done
by this steam heat.
