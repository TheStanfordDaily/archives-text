# "The War in Corea"—Lecture by a Diplomat.
## 
### 
The lecture in t'ie chapel last even
in'; was well attended, and wjs an ex
cellent exposition of the trouble now ex
isting between China, Japan, aud Corea.
Most of the students present were
worked up over football business, and
showed some uneasiness at the length
of the lecture, which was admirable in
every other way. Mr. Sheppard's
knowledge of these Oriental people was
acquired after a residence among them
of nearly twenty years.
Since the opening of the war, the site
of the conflict has moved from Corea
into Manchuria. The naval conflicts
are still confined, as they must be until
the closc of the war, to the Yellow Sea.
'I he natural conditions of the country
are most excellent for the carrying on
of war.
There is a vaster difference between
the people of China, Japan, and Corea
than is generally supposed. Ethno
logies lly, the Coreans are much more
nearly related to the Japanese than to
the Chinese; but both Corea and Japan
are children of China in civilization.
To render the situation still more
complcx, the past history of Japan is so
intimately associated with that of Corea
that the fate of one involves the des
tiny of the other. The dower that can
control them both will eventually rule

China with its 400,1)00,000 inhabitants.
It has been said of these nations that
ordinarily they sleep through time,
from one generation to another; but
that when one of them turns over
great changes are liable to take place
in human affairs. After three hun
dred years of isolation and slumber it
is the Japanese that are restlessly turn
ing over iu their beds—a turning over
that threatens to undo the established
institutions of centuries.
Until quite recently the Corean
army has been a striking instance of a
name that has survived the thing. But
the Coreans have never been a war-like
people, while on the other hand, the
Japanese have a great love of battle.
Moreover, the position of Corea is like
that of the corn between the two mill
stones. It was primarily the Japanese
love of conquest that started the pres
ent war. She occupies a position simi
lar to that of Great Britain, and she is
anxious to gain unlimited control over
the Orient. To this end her statesmen
have been bending all their energies for
the past twenty five years. The first
movement in this direction took place in
1873 when the Island of Formosa was
seized.
It is due to the futile indecision of
the Pekin government that China has
lost so many of her valuable dependen
cies during this time. Japan has
always had the upper hand over China.
Japan has also kept a fatherly outlook
over Corea, and in the western school
of diplomacy has been that country's
Cicero.
The weakness of China consists in
want of unity no less than in a want of
discipline, not only of the civil, but, of
its military systems. Were her latest
force and power well managed, she
could defy the world. Li Hung Chang,
the great Chinese general, was called
by Grant the Hismarck of Asia. It is
the policy of China to proloug the war,
and so gain time diplomatically. 4
