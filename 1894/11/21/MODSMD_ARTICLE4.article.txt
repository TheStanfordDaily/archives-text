# Last Opportunity for Theatre Tickets.
## 
### 
Arrangements have been made where
by those who have not purchased tickets
for the play Thanksgiving night can do
so by applying to Mr. Pinkham, room
91 Encina. Everyone who has any
intention of going to the California
theatre should purchase his ticket here
on the campus. The price has been
reduced to one dollar, and tickets pur
chased on the campus will be a source
of revenue to the Glee and Mandolin
Club. The tickets are sold for the
same price in the city. For some
reason the student body has been ex
tremely backward in this matter, onty
200 tickets having been sold. Every
student in the University should be at
the California Thanksgiving night.
