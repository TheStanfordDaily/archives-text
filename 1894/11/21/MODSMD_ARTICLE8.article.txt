# Cornell Crew Will Compete in the Henly Regatta.
## 
### 
At a recont meeting of the Cornell
Athletic Council it was decided to scinl
a crew to England. It will compete
with the famous Leander Club which is
made up of Oxford and Cambridge men.
The race is a mile-and-a-half oue m>
that the crew can be a light one. So
many of tlie younger oarsmen at
Cornell have a better chance for the
trip abroad than do the upper classmen .
