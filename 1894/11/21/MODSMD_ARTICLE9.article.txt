# Student Body Assessments.
## 
### 
In 1892 the student body assessment,
was one dollar. Twenty-one per cent
of the students paid it. In 1893, on a
fifty cent assessment, thirty-one per
cent, paid. This year forty-five per
cent, of the student body paid one dollar
apiece. This constant increase in the
number who pay theii assessments is
significant and gratifying, It is to be
hoped that there will be no retrogres
sion next year, but that, on the con
trary, every man will do his duty.
