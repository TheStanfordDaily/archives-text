# THE
						CAMP IN THE HILLS.
## 
### 
The Team Is At a Health Resort.
Everything: Very Satisfactory.
Woodside is a hamlet in the foothills
«if the Coast Range. It has about
three houses and some suburbs. In
one of these suburbs our men are work
ing. It is on the stage route from
Redwood to the summit. The first and
second teams have different quarters.
The first team occupies the hotel of the
place, which is a building of about
twelve rooms. The whole company eat
at this place. The second team sleep
in a four-roomed cottage about, a hun
dred yards from the hotel. This cot
tape is fitted up with cots supplied by
the football management, while blankets
are supplied by each man. AH around
the place the hand of the gardener is
visible. A park surrounds the hotel,
and flowers and conservatories are in
abundance, and one might almost say
that there are "fountains springing out
of beds of roses " There is plenty of
shade about the hotel, so that the fel
lows can lounge and rest in the ham
mocks when not training.
The football tiehi is about half a mile
from the hotel; this distance affords a
chance fora sprint to and from the
field. There is no turf on the field,
lnit it gives the appearance of having
been recently plowed and harrowed, so
I hat ii is quite soft. Camp sa\s that
ir. is a very desirable field ; none of the
fallows can get bruises by falling theie.
Many of the farmers in the neighbor
hood attended the first practice and
were curious to know what it was all
about. These are the only visitors
that can be allowed; any suspicious
looking person is invited to move on.
The men are very happy and are
greatly pleased with their quarters.
Everything is decidedly rustic. The
buxom country lasses wait upon the
table. " There's something we don't
have at Kneina," said one the men, re
ferring to the waitresses. The second
eleven gets lots of amusement out of
its crowded quarters. A doughty
guard wis heard to remark that he did
not " like washing in a sardine can."
The air, the water, and the milk are
the principal delights of the men.
THE DAILY ROUTINE.
The men breakfast at seven fifteen.
About an hour after breakfast they go
to work practicing signals and plays,
punting, falling on and catching the
ball, until about eleven-thirty. They
then rest an hour. Their favorite
1 Hinging place is a clump of old red
woods. There i-ome of them play cauls
about a rustic table while others lounge
in hammocks or sit on benches reading
the morning papers. At twelve-thirty
the luncheon Le 11 sounds—then there is
si wild race for the house. After lunch
the men putin the time studying or
reading, while some hunt or geologize
until two-thirty At two thirty the after
noon practice begins and continues
until dark. Six thiry is the dinner hour.
The then s!i >w wh.i' hea'thful ex

ercise will do towards building up an
appetite. After dinner the men lounge
about the house and put in their time
playing, singing, and reading. Most of
them are in bed loug before 10:30, for
their work is not the easiest in the
world. Thus ends a day'B work at our
football camp. Already the fellows
have lost all signs of logginess, and are
in the finest of spirits and condition.
yesterday's practice.
The teams lined up about three
o'clock. Kennedy and Frankenheimer
did not play with the Varsity. Soper
and Dole took their places. The work
of the second team, strengthened by
Walton, Whitehouse, and McMillan,
was full of life. They managed to make
five touch-downs to the Varsity's one.
Bernhard made a long run. Code made
a fine run on a catch from the kick-off.
McMillan, who played full back, made
good gains every time be took the ball.
After playing for awhile they practiced
signals until dark. This morning they
devoted to signal practice and puuting
