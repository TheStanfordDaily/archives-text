Though practice in singing foot
o ill songs is not to bo decried,
there is one great objection to the
expenditure of all our efforts and in
genuity in that manner. Football
songs are little used till after a vic
tory is won; they do not help to win
it. They add to the enjoynitnt if
tliu score stands right at, iheendof
t-Â») stootid half. If the other side
wins, all the ro'lick in 4 song<aie for
ten.
We should turn our attention
more to ingenious ways to add to
the enthusiasm and to incite our
team to herculean tfforts. List
year Berkeley far excelled us in this
tesptct. In the jells, for example,
t he contrast was maiked. <>ur man
ner of giving the yell was, and is
\et, ineffective in two ways: shiill
tones are used instead of deep chest
tones, and only small groups veil

iu unison. How great an improve
ment it would be for one mighty,
roaring volume of sound to swell out, j
instead of the explosion ot sharp;
yells here and there like Chinese
fire-crackers! The tone of the yell
can bo improved by individual ef
fort.
Unison can be secuied by the]
selection of a leader. Some one
should be chosen to wield the baton,
so that the whole Stanford contin
gent may jell at once aud continu
ously. The great success attending
the efforts of Messrs. JI ice and
Sheehan the first jear are not for
gotten by the old timers. Why not
again turn the matter over to these
gentlemen?
