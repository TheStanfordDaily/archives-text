# THE 						ATHLETIC TRACK.
## 
### 
Plans and Specifications Being Drawn up.
Work upon the new track will be be
gun the first of next week, and con
struction pushed as rapidly as possible.
As is generally known, the Southern
Pacific has donated the cinders. It
is thought that perhaps the
teams can be secured to do the hauling
of cinders and rock, but the question is
yet under consideration by Mr. Lathrop,
the business manager of the estate.
Mr. Mclntyre, track manager of the
Olympic Club of San Francisco, has
volunteered his services on the specifi
cations. Following his advice, the
foundation will consist of a four-inch
bed of rock and cement, upon which
will be packed two inches of coarse cin
ders and one fourth inch of binding
clay. This combination has been found
by the Olympic Club to make the best
possible track. The surveying was
done last year, and the wood curbing
constructed, under Maynard's manage
ment.
It is the intention to have an inter
class field day upon the completion of
the track, to which an admission will
be charged. Prizes or medals of some
kind will he offered for .all events. The
inter-class field-day will be followed by
a University field day, in which repre
sentatives will be chosen for the inter
collegiate contest with Berkeley in the
spring.
