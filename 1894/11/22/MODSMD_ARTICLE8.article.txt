# Blind Tom.

### 
131 inti Tom, the phenomenal colored
musician, who is to give a recital in the
chapel next Monday night, was horn
in slavery in 1849. lie has been blind
from birth. Aside from his wonderful
musical powers he is simple to the
ver>re of idiocy, the one faculty ot hi*
mind seeming to be developed at the
expense of all others, lie plays the
most difficult classical music with ease
upon hearing it once, and performs such
feats as playing three airs simultane
ously. lie also imitates all sorts of
musical instruments with his wonderful
powers of mimicry. Blind Tom has
long been a puzzle to psychologists, and
is a great curiosity.
