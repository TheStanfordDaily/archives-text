### 
On December Bth Pr. and Mrs.
Jordan will leave for Mazatlan, Mexico
wliere they will remain five or six
weeks. This will be in one sense a
vacation for Dr. Jordan; but under his
supervision a collection of animal life,
both marine and land, will be made.
The collection is under the auspices of
the Hopkins Laboratory, and its ex
penses will be paid by Mr. Hopkins.
A. duplicate of the one for the Univer.--
ity Zoological Museum will be collected
for the U. S. National Museum. Some
exchanges also of rarer specimens with
different natural history museums of
Europe will probably be effected.
G. H. Culver, '97, will accompany
the party as Dr. Jordan's assistant.
