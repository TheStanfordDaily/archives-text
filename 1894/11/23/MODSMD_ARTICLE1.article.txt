Judge W. W. Morrow, of the U. S.
I>i«triot Court, addressed the law stu
dents last evening upon '• Admiralty
and Maritime Jurisdiction." President
Jordan, introducing the speaker, said
we ought to feel highly honored by the
presence of Judge Morrow, since he
had adjourned his court to come down
to speak to us; an 1 he (President Jor
dan) himself had abjured a first-class
banquet in San Francisco to be here to
introduce him.
The Constitution of the United States
provides in one clause that the judicial
power of the United States shall extend
to all cases of admiralty Under that
simple sentence all the ureat maritime
commerce of this country, over ten
thousand millions oi dollars yearly, is
governed,
(\ingn sa once pas-ed a bill that ad
miralty juibdietion should be extended
t<> the Great Lakes, in England it had
obtained only where the tide ebbed and
flowed, since in that, country there
are no large inland lakes and rivers,
liut in the case ol the Genessee Chief
the supreme court held, that not by
reason ot any grant from Congress (that
was unnecessary), but by virtue of its
own inherent power, the court's juris,
diction was not confined to waters
where the tide ebbed and flowed, but to
all the navigable waters of the United
States.
I he maritime codes to which the
comts look when passing upon any state
ot facts, are few 'I he earliest mari
time law ot which wo have any record
was i hat of the island of llhodes, eleven
hundred years before the Christian era,
under the Kuiperor Augustus. I he
list codification was that of Louis XIV
of France in 1(181. It contains the
gi.»t of the admiralty law of all the pre
vious codes. All of these codes are
received with great tespect in admiralty
courts, not as conferring authority, but
as shedding light on perplexing points.
\Ve are not bound by precedents in
courts of admiralty. The <|uestion is,
What is right and what is just? and
according to that the case is decided.
One small volume is all that is neces
sary for a court of admiralty to have be
fore it in determining any question.
Admiralty law rules nearly alike the
world round. A decision of the ad
miralty court in San Francisco is ac
cepted in a like state of facts in Kng
land. Judge Morrow tried last sum
mer a case that arose in Chilian wafers
between a Scotchman and an English
man in ships of their native countries.
No American or American money was
involved. They were willing to try the
case in San Francisco because they
would get the same law and decision
there as in Liverpool. A delay is the
greatest danger to commerce. So ad
miralty courts arc open all the time,
and their action is summaiy.
Judge Morrow believes a knowledge
of the admiralty law of great importance
to us, fut ure business and professional

men of the Pacific coast. We are now
only upon the shore of the greatest com
merce that the world has ever seen.
In the Pacific are eleven hundred
islands, excluding Australia. These are
to be populated, and betweeu these is to
be the commerce of the future.
The carrying of the products of one
country to another has been the wealth
of the world from the beginning.
Rhodes was rich and flourishing when
Home was a quiet country town, Kng
land dominates the world today by
reason of her commerce, 15ut the
abode of commerce will shortly be the
Pacific Ocean. " You, young men,
must meet the greatest responsibilities
that have been known in the world. It
is my earnest hope that you will make
yourselves familiar wirh the constitu
tional law that regulates the commerce
of this country and the world."
