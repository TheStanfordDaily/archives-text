Til to tickets for the Stan ford-Berk
eley game are selling very slowly,
only 120 thus far, while over nine
hundred students lined up the first
d:iy at IF. C. All their seats are
sold and a committee appointed to
buy up all of ours still unsold on
Monday.
Tomorrow is the last day for get
ting seats to the game; all those
who do not purchase their reserved
seats' by that time will lose ail
chance. No time is to he lost by
those who intend to make one of the
Stanford crowd who will cheer our
m*Â»n to victory,
