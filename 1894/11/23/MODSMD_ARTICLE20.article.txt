### 
It is proposed to amend clause 2, sec
tion 2, article VI, of the constitution of
the Inter-Society Debating League by
striking out the words, " it beiug pro
vided that said selections shall be made
before the close of the lirst semester
(if each academic year." The cffect of
this amendment, if adopted, would be
to do away with the necessity of select
ing the inter-collegiate debaters this
semester.
