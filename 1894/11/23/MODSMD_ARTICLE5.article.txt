The football editor hied himself to
j the haunts of the team yesterday after
j noon on a bicycle, reaching there by
dint of much exertion in time to witness
I the afternoon practice.
The men spent about half an hour in
| practicing signals before lining up lor
j scrimmage. The grounds are not all
that could be desired, being somewhat
i uneven and very dusty.
The teams lined up as follows:
VARSITY SECOND ELEVEN.
I Spalding r end 1 Leavitt
Downing r tackle 1 ltice
Field r guard 1 Thomas
Ilazzard center Campbell
Fiekert I guard r .. .Burnett
Cochran ... I (uckln r j Whi.cbouse

Cotton. 1 end r Pauley
Harrelson ) . ( Code

Reynolds r half I Hern hard
hole 1 half r Walton
I Kenned)' full back Soper
The center men are improving in
j breaking through. Field puts up a
line game, making a number of good
tackles. The tackles made good gains
i and tackled low and hard. Capt.
Downing was sure of five yards nearly
every time he was given the ball. The
; ends were given very little tackling to
' do. Cotton, however, seems inclined
to be drawn in. He is also lax in get
ting into plays. Reynolds is improv.
itig in his tackling and appears to run
harder and lower. Dole played a good
game but once or twice seemed inclined
jto run back. Kennedy is improving
[steadily. He made three out o!
J four trials at lair catches. Har
relson did well at i|uarter. He made
one good run on a scattered field. liaz
| zard continues to pass the ball too high,
causing tumbles. He was forced to re
tire before the end of the practice, as
was also Hall. Jule Frankenheimer is
uot yet able to play. He practices
catching a good deal. Hurnett showed
up so well on the second eleven that
! towards the end of the practice he ex
changed places with Fickeit
There is no doubt but the seclusion
j will benefit the team. The environ
i merits are very well adapted to their
; purpose. They experienced some diffi
j culty with the cold the first night, but
1 that was remedied yesterday.
