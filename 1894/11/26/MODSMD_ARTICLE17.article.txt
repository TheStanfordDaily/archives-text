Tiie Southern Pacific has granted
a round-trip rate of SI .25 to San
Francisco for the ensuing year. The
company will undoubtedly be the
gainer for the rate, as many will avail
themselves of the opportunity to
visit the theatres and do business in
San Francisco who would not go if
the expense were great. The rate is
good from Saturday to Monday only.
