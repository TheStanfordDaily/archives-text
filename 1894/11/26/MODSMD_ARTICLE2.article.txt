# Saturday at the Quarters.

### 
MORN I NO.
I Ie teams got out about ten o'clock.
They practiced the rudiments and then
the signals for about an hour. The
plh\ing lacked the necessary vim. This
was due chit fly to the heat and the ex
ceedingly dusty condition of the ground
This dust, although doing away with
any great iik 1 ihood of injury to the
players, is very detrimental to quick
work. The practice lasted lor about
an hour. Kennedy made a couple of
good runs. Field put up a good game
at guard. Spalding- was laid off after
playing a few minutes, and Leavitt took
his place. The second team was unable
to score. I>cwning gave the signals,
making great improvement in the
quickness of the line-up.
AFTERNOON.
The men appeared upon the field at
three o'clock. No one, outside of the
team and coaches, was permitted to
witness the signal practice. The after
noon game was characterized by a great
deal of snappy playing. Kennedy ran
very well with the ball. Franken
heimer was unable to play, and Dole
took his place. The tackling of
lleynolds has improved immensely in
the past week. Spalding made good
gains. He follows his interference
well, but is rather slow in getting down
the field. Cotton was laid off, and
I'auley played his end until he had his
arm strained, when he was relieved by
Clemans. Cochran and Downing played
their usual game. Downing will give
the signals regularly now. Field kept
up his good work of the morning.
Fickert is probably a fixture at left
guard, although he was changed to the
second team on Friday morningr, Hurnett
to center on the Varsity, and Hazzard
to a similar position on the scrubs.
The scrubs, principally by McMillan's
work at full, were enabled to make a
touchdown.
PUNT OUTS.
It is rumored that beans arc selling
at (en cents per pound at Woodsidc.
The men are hardening themselves
by scrapping over the single daily paper.
The team leaves for the city on the,
flyer on Thursday. They will do heavy J

work today, light work tomorrow, and
rest Wednesday.
There are twenty-nine men, all told,
at the football camp.
Campbell and Leavitt have returned
from the football camp.
Kosendale has gone out to Camp
Stanford, and will remain thereon duty
There was a steady stream of vibitors
to the football camp in the mountains
yesterday, atid the boys were kept busy
showing them their new quarters. The
composition of the visitors was not con
fined to the male students alone.
