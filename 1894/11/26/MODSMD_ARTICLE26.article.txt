# Freshman Football.
## 
### 
Arrangements have been nearly com
pleted for the Stanford-Berkeley fresh -
mau football game, to be played in Sau
Francisco on Dec. 8. The Stauford
freshmen will not resume regular
practice until after the return of six of
their players from the mountains.
The Boys High School of Sau Fran
cisco, with which arrangements had
been made fora contest with the fresh
tnau eleven, are now trying to back out of
the agreement, but Manager Frazier
says that he will hold them to it. The
game, if it occurs at all, will take place
on the Saturday after the big game.
