# Sunday Sermon.
## 
### 
The sermon Sunday morning; wus
preached by I)r. Jordan. It is seldom
we ever hear a sermon so purely alle
gorical throughout as was the "Story of
the Innumerable Company." In many
respects it was not unlike the Pilgrims'
Progress, and was a clear revelation of
the preacher's own views regarding
Christianity.
Humanity was represented on the
way of life beset on all sides by dangers
and difficulties, but lured ever onward
by the fleeting vision of a distant land
beyond the river and the mists.
One who bad traveled the great way
in safety left as a priceless heritage a
chart showing the way with every rock
and obstruction. But as time went on
the chart was mutilated and altered by
those who strove to follow and to im
prove it. This led to strife among the
numberless throng—and at last it was
decided that it was best to allow each
to take bis own way, and to refer to
the great chart, and accept the
counsel of the Guide as his own heart
prompted him.
The sermon carried admirable lessons
to every hearer.
