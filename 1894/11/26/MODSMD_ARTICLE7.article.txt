Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The enthusiasm over football and the
new track has been so great as to ut
terly eclipse the efforts of the women in
their line of athletics. Since the Var
sity men have gone into retirement,
and the track is an assured success, the
University world may be interested to
learn that the Woman's Athletic As
sociation has not been idle.
Basket-ball is attracting the most
enthusiastic attention. The teams have
begun regular practice under the di
rection of a coach, in preparation for
the expected match games with Castil
leja and the Normal.
A week ago twelve players drove
down from San Jose to watch a Stan
ford game. The temptation to play led
them to engage in two or three rounds
with the Stanford girls, who promptly
defeated them.
To be fair we must state that the
Stanford team is composed largely of
old players, while the game was <|uit.e
recently introduced at San Jose. The
Stanford game is stronger, having been
influenced by football methods, and
centers about the goals, while the visi
tors spread their men over the field,
with the strength at the center, to keep
the ball from the opponents' goal.
