# REPORT FROM THE HILLS.
## Individual Condition of the Men Men In Fine Shape. The 						Team Will Practice Only Signals Tomorrow. 
### 
The field in the hills is covered with
a coating of sand thick enough to ab
sorb all the rain, so that the team will
not practice in mud at all The Var
sity did not line up against the second
eleven today, but practiced signals in
the rain. The final practice will occur
tomorrow; nothing however will be done
but signal practicing. Most of the men
are in good shape.
llazzard hue a somewhat trouble
some cold, .foe Field is the same burly
in in as ever; nothing seems to hurt Joe
at all. Fickert has wrenched his wrist,
but it will not materially affect his
ability to play. ('apt. Downing has a
slight cold and Cochran has a lame leg.
It. is expected, however, that he will be
alright after Wednesday's rest. Spald
ing, llarrelson, Kennedy, and lieynolds
are all in fine form. Frankenheitner's
knee is troublesome, and it is possible
i hat he will not be able to play the
game through. Jule will tight like a
Trojan, h iwever. and will not give in
unless absolutely compelled to Stan
lord relics on Jule and is justified in
doing so. Cotton has a sore shoulder
but it is not of much importance; '98
must feel gratified at having so fine a
representative on the Varsity.
It is a matter of congratulation that
our best men have gone through the
season without serious injury and that
no it's are possible.
The following men will be on hand
as substitutes: Burnett, Hall, Dole,
Pauley, Soper, Code. Thomas, Bombard,
and Rice.
