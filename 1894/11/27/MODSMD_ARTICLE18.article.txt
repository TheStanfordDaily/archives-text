While our men are getting the
benefit of exhilarating mountain
breezes and rustic scenery, the Berk
eley footballers are filling their lungs
with that smoky slop which in San
Francisco they call "the air," and
are gazing at the not over-pleasant
prospect of the board fences which
surround the Haight St. grounds,
While we do not know the reasons
which decided Mr. Gill in the choice
of Haight street, we feel that the
choice by our coach lias been the
wiser and most productive of good
results.
