Thursday will be a crucial test of
Stanford men in more ways than
one. Should victory be ours, one
can remember the intensity of the
feeling of our opponents and respect
it, and not add to their chagrin by
public gibes. Should defeat be our
lot, we can solace ourselves with the
thought that our teum did nobly, for
mo question can ever be raised on
such a point, 15ut whatever the out
come of the game, every Stanford
man must remember that, whether
in victory or defeat, lie the
prestige of the University in his
keeping. Little that ho may do
cm redound to its glory, but every
trilling act which does not bear the
maik of manliness and magnanimity
will sully and demean the fair name
of the whole student body
