# U.C. football Song.
## 
### 
Tune of Huckleberry Do.
The Stanford boys they think their team
Ik good enough to win ; [too,
They've soaked their hats, suspenders
And put up all their tin. I line,
We'll run their ends, we'll buck their
And kick the ball on high:
And when our team scores all its points,
We'll give them this and cry:
Oh, do, do my Stanford do,
lie careful what you do,
You'll need to have a mascot [do.
That is stronger than a Jioo doo, you
Do, do my Stanford do,
He careful what you do —
Don't try to beat the U. boys
They surely will do you.
—112 (lecident.
[ t he above song shows a spirit far
different from the one inspiring rle
public statements made <juitc recently
as 'o 11. O.'s hopes ]
