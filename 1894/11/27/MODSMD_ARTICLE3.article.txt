# Blind Tom.
## 
### 
The performance of Blind Tom last
night was attended by a fair-sized
audience. The program was pleas
ing throughout. The audience hardly
knew what to think, when after the
iirst number, Tom vociferously

applauded himself*. To hear him in
troduce and comment upon himself is
alone worth the price of admission. |
Tom understands very little of what he
says while making his long speeches.
He uses the third person entirely in re
ferring to himself. This peculiar style
comes from his power to imitate. All
the speeches that the audience heard
last night used to be given by his old
master Major Bethune, but now Tom
gives them himself verbatim.
His power of reproducing sounds and
melody is truly wonderful. The
music box might be mentioned as espec
ially fine.
Tom plays the most classical music
after hearing it, and his power of repro
duction is so strong that if the person
playing for Tom makes a mistake the
sime mistake will be present in Tom's
playing.
"In Tom's own peculiar way" he is a
poet, but not in any other way. We
are also sorry for "The Man Who
Sprained His Knee."
The descriptive piece, "The Battle of
Manassas " is the pride of Tom's heart,
and it is said that he will never give a
program which does not include this
piece.
Blind Tom is the property of the
United States. When Major Bethune,
his former owner, died, the heirs had
an altercation as to the one who should
own the negro, as he was a veritable
mint. The court decided that he was
a ward of the United States, being an
idiot, He makes an average of sixty
thousand dollars every year for the
United States
