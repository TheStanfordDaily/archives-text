Henry h b — —
This is the latest list obtainable. It
is understood that Hunt cannot play
and that Wittermeyer, although badly
hurt, is sufficiently recovered to have a
place. Henry has been placed on the
team as a half-back at almost the last
moment, so that his age, weight, and
height arc not at hand.
The total weight of the Berkeley
team is approximately 1850
this allows 160 pounds for Henry. The
average weight is then about 1G9
pounds ; this is about three pounds less
average than our own .
