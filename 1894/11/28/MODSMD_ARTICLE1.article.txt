# SOME THINGS ABOUT THE MEN.
## Where They Come From—Previous Football Experience. 
### 
Although most of what is given be
lt.w litis been detailed over and over
again, the demand to have it retold is
too vigorous to deny.
This is the fourth year that Capt.
Downing has played in college. The
litst year he played half-back and did
some heavy work in that position. In
'1)2 he played guard and in '93 took
the center position vacated by J>urn
hisol. Vigor and vim are the elements
which make his'play successful. lie
was bo' n in California twenty years ago.
Our huge center, Hazzard, is an un
tried man in an inter-collegiate game.
No fears are entertained as to his abil
ity to make his 210 pounds tell to the
gieatest advantage. This is his first
year of play although a member of '95.
lie has played at various times on class
tian.s, and has always been considered
a potential football man. Twenty-four
years ago he was born and waxed large
and strong in Indiana.
Cotton, of '1)8, a man in size and in
years a boy, for he is only seventeen,
has done some remarkable work on the
Varsity. Although he has played end
only fora few weeks, he is a trust
worthy man for the position. He comes
from the Belmont School where he
played guard on the team. Although
his home is in California, he was born
in lowa.
Cochran, 'DO, comes from Southern
California and was bom in Illinois. He
played left tackle at Lawrenceville
Academy and has played in the same
position here for two years. Conscien
tious playing has marked his play all
through, lie is one of the best men
for team work.
.Jack Reynolds, '00, plays for the
first time this year as right half. Ilis
birthplace is Illinois but his parents
live in Oakland. He is a low runner
and can make good time. He has held
down his position this year with re
markable success, considering that it is
his first year of play.
.1 ule Frankenhcimcr has played for
three years. He made the team in his
freshman year and played end. Last
year lie played left half, and none won
his laurels so clearly at the last inter
collegiate as he. His home is in Stock
ton, his native place. His 155 pounds
is near the ground, as he is 5 ft. 7 in.
in height.
llarrelson, a senior, plays in the in
tercollegiate as a Varsity man for the
first time. He had never seen a team
line up until entering college. He did
not play in his freshman year, but
acted as sub-half in his sophomore
year. Last year he acted as sub-half
and quarter, aud played a brilliant
game as quarter after Code was ruled
off. A level head and good generalship
eminently qualify him for his placc on
the team. His homo is in Stockton
where also he was born.
Kennedy, '1)5, born in Indiana and

at present hailing from Colorado, has
been a footballer all through his course,
lie played half-back at the University
of Colorado during his freshman year. |
He has played in both inter-collegiate
contests with U. C. as full-back. He
has the fortune to say that he has never
played with a losing team. Let us pray
that he may be able to say the same
after tomorrow. From most indica
tions it would seem that he would make
a better half-back than full-back. He
does not lose his head, and possibly for
this feature he is better known than for
any other.
Fickert of I>akei>field, California,
was a freshman last year and played on
the second eleven then. He is captain
of the '07 team and is a hard player.
He forms the .third of the trio which
Stanford men have come to consider
impregnable.
Field, alias the hirsute Joe, hails
from Dallas, Texas, This is his first
experience in inter-collegiate work. He
acted as substitute guard iu his fresh
man year and has done some good work
for his class team, doe personally has
been a little doubtful as to his ability to
hold down his job, and outsiders have
fed his fear, so that in order to attain
the object of his life he has worked in
tensely and merits his success. Dash
ing and hardy define his style.
Spalding of the junior class, though
named last, is an end who is hard to
beat — rapid and sure. He had never
played until his sophomore year when
he was a candidate for right end and
gave Capt. Wilson an interesting race
for the position. Some dashing work
is expected from this representative of
Kansas.
Of the substitutes it may be said
that few teams have lined up with so
many linemen ready to step into their
places. Several of them are old Var
sity men and have made the present
holders of their positions on the team
earn them by the hardest kind of work.
Some idea of the estimate in which the
substitutes are held by the coaches may
be gathered from the advice of one of
them to some of the line men, not to
save themselves in the game but to play
their hardest, as there arc plenty of
fine men to take their places.
