Pnooitiss and improvement in
football management necessarily
come out of ixperience. Ihe past
managements were undoubtedly con
ducted in the best manner known
then. New ideas have come to the
front this year; and for the execution
of these ideas and fora general desire
to do the best possible for team and
college, the students must thank the
business management. For the evo
lution of a creditable team out of the
unpromising materials of the early
part of the season, our gratitude aud
our thanks must be f>iven to Walter
Camp, and also, though not sec
ondly, to Paul Downing, whose in
spiring example has made the team,
as made up of individuals, surprise
and surpass itself.
