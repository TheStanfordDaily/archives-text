It has been repeated from time to
time that western football can never
come up to that in the east. This
may be so if the statement is limited
to the coming few years. It is ab
surd to suppose that a team as heavy
and strong and intelligent as those
in the east, and trained by the best
coaches who have ever guided Yale
to victory, must be inferior simply
because it is found in the discredited
west. The preparator\ r schools are
already sending men up to college
with a penchant for the game. This
is evidenced by the success this year
of the representative from a neigh
boring academy. Let the progress
continue which has characterized the
past three years, and the west may
be a creditable child of the " Father
of Football "
