# LECTURE BY PROF. ALEY.
## Daniel Kirkwoodâ€”America's Astronomer 
### 
An audience of forty-three indicated
conclusively that other things were
abroad to take the time and attention of
Stanford people. No matter wliat in
ducements should be offered it would
be impossible to get a large lecture
healing audience when so many foot
ball hopes had to be discussed.
Prof. Aley spoke of Daniel Kirk
wood as a personal friend and as one
who had gained inspiration from the
piofessor's personality. The lecturer
told in a concise and pleasing way the
short story of Prof. Kirkwood's busy
life. How he had not been born to for
tune but with only capacities for be
boming the greatest theoretical astron
omer of this generation. Didiana re
gards him as one of the noblest of her
adopted children. His name is a syn
onym for kiudncss, gentleuess, and
courtesy all through the State. Not
only, however, has he a local reputation,
lie ia best known in Europe where his
power of mathematical induction, his
great aptitude for propounding theories,
is most recognized. Proctor has called
him the Kepler of America. Ilis
modesty has been the charm of his life;
few men with such renown care so
little for public recognition. Ilis
whole attitude toward his life work is
that it will be recognized and live if it
is worth preserving, if not, it is better
that no mention be made of it.
