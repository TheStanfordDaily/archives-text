# THE 						BERKELEY FLATS
## How Our Friends the Enemy Are Living. 
### 
The new training quarters, in which
the U. C. football team has been located
fora week, is situated at 507 Frederick
street, San Francisco, within two
blocks of the Haight street grounds.
The (juarters comprise six Hats, there
being two three-story buildings adjoin
ing each other. In all there are twenty
nine rooms, aud there are just twenty
nine men to occupy them, by a curious
coincidence.
The lower flats are used for dining
and sitting-rooms. The bedrooms are
all on the second and third floors. As
the weather is quite cool, grate fires
are kept burning in the sitting and din
ing-room. Hesides these rooms there
is the drying room, where the San
Francisco fog is mechanically extracted
from the football togs; the store-room,
where a supply of the latest llarvey
ized nose protectors are kept in stock;
and five shower baths. The rooms are
said to have the latest hospital appli
ances, with a supply of trained nurses.
Mr. Lang, the football manager, says it
is his sole ambition to make the men
happy.
Besides the coach six servants and
two professional "rubbers" are em
ployed, and the establishment receives
two visits daily from both Dr. Morse
and I)r. Fitsgibbon.
