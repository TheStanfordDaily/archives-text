## 
### 
The attention of students is drawn to
a Stanford production which appeared
| in today's Examiner, and which there
is no space to reproduce. It is written
I after the manner of our rival. It seems
as though the writer had been trained
i with the U. C- corps of reporters. Un-
I doubtedly our opponents [of tomorrow
| will feel gratified and give up training
I since our team is all but out of sight.
