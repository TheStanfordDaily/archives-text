# CARDINAL vs BLUE AND GOLD
## Stanford Still on Top—'Three Years of Labor Won. STANFORD STILL UNDEFEATED. A 						Close Game—Only One Touchdown- Score 6-0. 
### 
At 10:45 on Thursday morning a
large crowd awaited the opening of the
ticket office at the llaight St. grounds,
lie tare noon the choice portions of the
grandstands were occupied. The im
mense crowd, impatient and nervous,
that congregated outside the grounds
about two o'clock in the afternoon,
could not be accommodated fast enough,
although one hundred each minute
were being -J passed through the turn
stiles fora little while. The great
crush could not be resisted aud a thous
and or more had to pass through the
turnstiles without tickets, which they
purchased when once inside. The
management has been charged with
selling more tickets than they had seats
for s;Ue. This is not exact; the amount
of space, eighteen inches, allowed for
each person at such a public place,
proved inadequate for many of the
I -idles, aud consequently it appeared as
it more space had been sold than was
on hand. Again, many men holding
unreserved tickets, ciimbt-d over the
fence aud thus aided in overcrowding.
The beautiful day made the covers
for the grandstands unnecessary, al
though arrangements had been made
to supply them on Thursday morning
if it seemed needful. This ability to
dispense with this outlay saved some
where about four hundred dollars.
Close on 10,000 people passed through
the turnstiles —the exact number lias
not yet been ascertained. About 2:25
the Hand marched on to the grounds to
the applause of the multitude; its happy
performance at the b Palace Hotel iu the
morning had won for it an enviable
reputation. Alter marchingj-ound the
grounds it took its place in the Stan
ford grandstand.
Exactly at 2:'30, the time called for
tMe game, an enormous squad of Ber
keley players came on the field, twenty
one in all. They all looked in line
trim, and made many a Stanford sup
porter fee! dubious. A few minutes
later the Stanford tally-ho brought our
players on the grounds amid a deafen
ing applause. Hy 2:35 the teams were
lined up; Berkeley had won the toss
aud chose the western end of the field.
This was very much to their advantage,
for the sun was bright and low, and
made it necessary for our men, Harrel*
son and Kennedy, to shade their eyes
when on the lookout fora punt. Not
withstanding this fact almost the whole
playing, lirst and second half, was on
the western half of the field.

Many times since Thursday has the
game been discussed and debated, and
questionable points referred to com
petent football men. The ball was fol
lowed by an authority with the result
that
THE (JAM B
can be reproduced as follows:
Kennedy kicked off for forty yards.
The ball was run in for thirteen yards
by Porter who was downed by ( Cotton.
U. C. then sent Henry round the right
end who was tackled by Cotton. The
left end was then played twice, gaining
first ten and secondly five yards;another
gain of seven yards rouud right end
made Stanford supporters feel a little
shaky. The rapid way the ball was be
ing carried down the field nettled our
men and brought'them down to earnest
work. Sherman next went through
the center for three yards, followed by
a left end play by Henry who was
tackled by Downing without gain.
Stanford then lost ten yards for off side
play by one <if the center men. Two
plays around right end were tried by
Henry, gaining three yards and one
yard.
Stanford got the ball on three downs,
fifteen yards from center on its own ter
ritory. Now was the crittical moment.
U. O.'s play had startled the spectators,
and they needed some reassurance from
Stanford. A more open game followed.
The first two plays were wedge plays by
which three yards were gained. The
third one was a fake wedge, for Ken
nedy kicked thirty yards. Ransome
caught the ball and Dowuing missed the
tackle. Ransome was a hard man to
hold as was shown on several occasions,
llansouie returned the punt for forty
yards and llarrelson caught it. At the
next line-up Kennedy punted for
twenty yards aud Hanson.e got the
ball on touch line. Henry then made
a fatal play; he ran back and was
tackled by Cotton, losing ten yards.
Ransome next gained five yards by cen
ter play.
Stanford's ball on downs. By a
series of center plays by Cochran and
Kennedy, the ball was forced forward
twelve yards five more were made by a
Herkcley foul, seveu more by Jule
through right tackle, then four by
Cochran round end and ten by Spald
ing round left end. The next play
was a kick by llarrelson. Everyone
fumbled, and the quarter was able to
regain the ball. Wedge play by Ken
nedy made five yards, and four yards
was gained by a Berkeley off side play.
This was half the distance to Berkeley's
goal line. Two more plays by Kennedy
through center only gained two yards,
and on the third no pain was made, the
U. C. line resisting like a stone wall.
Berkeley got the ball two yards from
the goal. Ransome tried to kick, but
Stanford men got through and Ran
some made a dash for end and gained
twelve yards. Five yards through
tackle and a kick of thirty yards by
Ransome gave the ball to Kennedy who
ran five yards before being downed.

By a long series of short gains through
center and tackles and ends, the ball
was forced forty-one 3 ards down the field,
when Berkeley got the ball on downs.
Ransome on first down punted for
thirty yards, which was regained by
Wilson, Kennedy having dropped the
ball; Sherman and Porter by center
plays gained six yards. U. C. fumbled
the next play, and Field was on them
like a Hash, The next play was the
one that made every spectator feverish,
llansome dropped back for kick upon
the forty-yard line: our men, Fickcrt
and Cochran, burst through the line
aud Fickert got the ball iull in his
lace. It was a forty-yard punt for cer
tain fur it bounced from Fickert's face
and fell rolling along about fifteen
yards ahead. The smash dazed Fick
ert, but Cochran was after it with llan
some close behind him. Every Stan
ford man wanted to shout suggestions,
Camp said to himself, " fall 011 it, fall
on it"; but Cochran involuntarily
punted it forward with his knee for
another ten yards, and at his second at
tept to pick it up kicked it over the
goal line, and by a clever piece of work,
fell on it, and secured the first and
ouly touchdown.
Kennedy punted out and Harrelson
caught. Kennedy kicked the goal.
Score, 0 to 0.
To call this piece of work a fluke is
to use the lauguage of those wishing to
find an excuse for defeat. The line
men have been trained for three mouths
to break through the line; they were
successful many times Thursday, and
downed the runners behiud the line; it
was simply good football. It was good
football for Fickert and Cochran to
break through the line, aud bad work on
U. C.'s part to leave her fudbuck un
protected.
llansome punted off for forty-five
yards, the longest kick of the day.
Kennedy caught the hall and ran for
ward fifteen yards, and theu punted,
Fickert tackling the catcher ten yards
past center, thus giving a gain of ten
yards on the kick-off. Ransome punted
again for thirty-five yards, and Ilarrel
son, who showed himself a sure catch
all through the game, caught it.
Kennedy then went through cen
ter for five yards. Jule made three
yards through tackle, and Reynolds
made the run of the day, fifteen yards
round left end. Ilarrelson made eight
yards on a criss-cross from Reynolds.
Downing went through center for one
yard, and Frankenheimer went round
end for three yards, and an attempt
was made to choke him by Benson who
was forced to desist by Field. Ken
nedy kicked for thirty yards, and was
caught by llansome who ran in fifteen
yards, when time was called, with the
ball about fifteen yards on TJ. C. ter
ritory.
THE SECOND HALF,
was the one that tested the nerves of
Stanford supporters. At every play it
seemed doubtful what would be the out
come. The last twenty minutes of this

half was an intense time for all. It was
impossible to keep one's seat; even the
request of ladies behind could not make
the men in the front rows sit down.
Pierce kicked off and Kennedy
missed the ball on the fly but gained
it on first bounce and made ten yards.
Frankenheitner then went through
tackle tor five yards. Kennedy and
Cochran then gained two and three
yards through the line. Tackles fell
back for next play which resulted in no
gain. Kennedy punted for thirty yards
and Spalding made a clean tackle of
Kansome who caught and tried to run.
Porter went through the line for
three yards, and Ransome punted on
the second down, and was caught by
Kennedy who made ten yards. Down
ing crashed through for three yards.
Six yards were next gained by three
men back, but ball went to U. C. fur
off-side. Kansome kicked and Ilarrel
son caught the ball; this play provoked
the unnecessary roughness for which
IMunkett was ruled off". During the
scrimmage the ball was forced from
Harrelson, and U. C. lined up with the
ball in their possession. In two plays,
three yards were gained, and in the
third Heuson, the quarter-back, kicked
out to Sherman on left end, who was on
side all right and snatched the ball and
dashed over Stanford goal line, only to
be tackled so hard and low by Spalding
that he let go the ball and Harrelson
fell on it, thus making a touch-back.
This cannot be called a fluke. It is
football to hold on to the ball through
thick and thin, and to drop the ball is a
fumble, synonymous with poor football.
Kennedy then kicked off the ball from
the 25-yard line, which was returned
by llunsome. After this play began
the anxious part of the game; it seemed
often that U. C. would force our men
over the line, but invariably at the crit
ical moment our line became a stone
wall, and no generalship or onslaught
could avail.
Cochran went through for eight
yards. Kennedy on two wedge plays
for six yards and one yard. Franken
hcimer then went through center for
six yards and lost the ball. Ilenry went
round right end for ten yards, lie was
to go around end again but Field broke
through and downed him behind the
line. Kansome made a punt which
was returned by Kennedy, and again
sent skyward into his arms, ten yards
being lost on the returns. About this
time a heavy fog rolled in and almost
enveloped the players.
For the remainder of the game it was
a series of fierce aggressive plays on
the part of Berkeley and strong de
termined defensive plays by Stanford.
Time and time again, three of U. C.'s
men lined up behind each other, ten
yards back of the line and charged it
without a gain. It was admirable work
that stopped a charge, and only trained
men could stand the exertion. Feel
ing among the spectators was intense
at this point; the game ended with the
ball in Stanford's hands. Score G-0.

missed the ball on the fly but gained
it on first bounce and made ten yards.
Frankenheitner then went through
tackle tor five yards. Kennedy and
Cochran then gained two and three
yards through the line. Tackles fell
back for next play which resulted in no
gain. Kennedy punted for thirty yards
and Spalding made a clean tackle of
Kansome who caught and tried to run.
Porter went through the line for
three yards, and Ransome punted on
the second down, and was caught by
Kennedy who made ten yards. Down
ing crashed through for three yards.
Six yards were next gained by three
men back, but ball went to U. C. fur
off-side. Kansome kicked and Ilarrel
son caught the ball; this play provoked
the unnecessary roughness for which
IMunkett was ruled off". During the
scrimmage the ball was forced from
Harrelson, and U. C. lined up with the
ball in their possession. In two plays,
three yards were gained, and in the
third Heuson, the quarter-back, kicked
out to Sherman on left end, who was on
side all right and snatched the ball and
dashed over Stanford goal line, only to
be tackled so hard and low by Spalding
that he let go the ball and Harrelson
fell on it, thus making a touch-back.
This cannot be called a fluke. It is
football to hold on to the ball through
thick and thin, and to drop the ball is a
fumble, synonymous with poor football.
Kennedy then kicked off the ball from
the 25-yard line, which was returned
by llunsome. After this play began
the anxious part of the game; it seemed
often that U. C. would force our men
over the line, but invariably at the crit
ical moment our line became a stone
wall, and no generalship or onslaught
could avail.
Cochran went through for eight
yards. Kennedy on two wedge plays
for six yards and one yard. Franken
hcimer then went through center for
six yards and lost the ball. Ilenry went
round right end for ten yards, lie was
to go around end again but Field broke
through and downed him behind the
line. Kansome made a punt which
was returned by Kennedy, and again
sent skyward into his arms, ten yards
being lost on the returns. About this
time a heavy fog rolled in and almost
enveloped the players.
For the remainder of the game it was
a series of fierce aggressive plays on
the part of Berkeley and strong de
termined defensive plays by Stanford.
Time and time again, three of U. C.'s
men lined up behind each other, ten
yards back of the line and charged it
without a gain. It was admirable work
that stopped a charge, and only trained
men could stand the exertion. Feel
ing among the spectators was intense
at this point; the game ended with the
ball in Stanford's hands. Score G-0.
