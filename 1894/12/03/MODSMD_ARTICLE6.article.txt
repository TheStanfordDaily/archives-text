It seems absurd that the reporters
of the large dailies should be unable
1o distinguish a San Francisco sp>rt
from a Stanford man. It is ridicul
ous that the University should be
credited with the type of men that
can be bred only by San Francisco's
looseness and ribaldry. There were
ten thousand at the game; about one
tenth of these were Stanford people
proper. Many of the others were
Thanksgiving holiday makers out for
a high time, and finding security
under the colors ofjthe Universities,
went to excess. Universities nre
not (raining schools for ruffians; but
ruffians often sail under (he colors
of a college, for they find a security
afforded them by its fair name. Aud
to this typo of men must be credited
the doing* of Thanksgiving night.
