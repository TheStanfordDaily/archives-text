It is very gratifying to noto that
the game was a success financially
us well as in oilier respects. The
total amount taken in was some
thing over eleven thousand dollars,
and after the common expenses are
deducted there will be over nine
thousand dollars to be divided be-
Iwecn the two colleges. This will
enable us to pay otTall indebtedness,

including the accounts that have
been accumulating for the last few
years. The amount remaining after
all bills are paid is estimated at
about one thousand dollars. This is
the first year that we have been able
to meet all indebtedness, and our
victory together with the bright pros
pects in view, gives us cause for con
gratulation all round. A full state
ment of finances will appear in to
morrow's issue.
