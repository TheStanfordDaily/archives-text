### 
Invitations have been sent out. by the
I'niversity Club to the Stanford and
Berkeley football teams to be present at
a banquet to be given iri San Francisco
on next Saturday week, December 15th.
The Stanford team has accepted the
invitation; Berkeley has not yet made
known her wishes. Such a testimonial
as this banquet is eminently fitting and
desirable. The men who have worked
like Trojans during many weary woeks,
in order to uphold the name of their
college, are certainly deserving of ban
quets and other good things. The
University Club has done a most grace
ful act in tendering the dinner.
On the day of the banquet the trophy
football, made of silver, will be jriven
to Stanford, in whose possession it will
remain till Berkeley can wrest it away
by superior football. The result and
date of the recent game have been en
graved on the trophy. Those who are
anxious to see it will soon have an op
portunity to gratify their curiosity, for
it will be placed on exhibition.
