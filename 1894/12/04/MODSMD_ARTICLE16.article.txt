A moment's reflection by those who
smoke in the Law Library, ought to
convince them that their action
hardly shows a due regard for others
who are compelled to use the library
at the same lime. At best the air of
the room, when cix or eight men are
working there together, is far from
healthful; but with the addition of a
cloud of smoke from pipes and ci
gars of more or less dubious excel
lence, the atmosphere approaches the
intolerable. The simple mention of
this matter ought to put an end to
all complaints on the subject.
