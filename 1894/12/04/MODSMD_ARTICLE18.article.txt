If the first football game between
Stanford and Berkeley freshmen
shall prove remarkably successful in
drawing a large number of students
and the outside public to theHa'ght
St.grounds.it may be well, as a finan
cial measure to hold "future Fresh
men contests in San Francisco. We
are inclined to believe, however, that
from many points of view it would
seem more desirable for the Fresh
men to play on college grounds, one
year on the Stanford campus and
the next year on Berkeley's. Such
a course would certainly insure a
larger student attendance than can
otherwise be hoped for. It will not
be fair to expect Stanford men who
wish to see all the games to spend
the money, time and, trouble which
a trip to San Francisco from Palo
Alto entails, while the supporters of
Berkeley can accomplish the same
end at almost no expense.
