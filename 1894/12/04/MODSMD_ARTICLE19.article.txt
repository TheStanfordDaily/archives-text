The invitation to play a game
with the University of Chicago is one
that our football management ought
not to refuse without very careful
consideration. There is an almost
univeisal desire on the campus to
see the game played and there are
many facts which justify tho desire.
Such a contest would go far toward
putting the University in touch in
more wnys than one with the East,
and would .be the entering wedge
for future games with Eastern insti
tutions It would give us an ex
cellent opportunity to compare our
team with some of the more famous
football aggregations on tho other
coast. If the comparison were
found favorable to us, wbo can say
but that in a few years we may be
playing Pennsylvania or Piinceton
or Hurvard or Yale ? A game with
Chicngo during the comingjholidays
would undoubtedly draw a vast
crowd and would prove a great finan
cial success. In brief, tho coutest
would afford us the opportunity to
gain much and we should risk noth
ing.
