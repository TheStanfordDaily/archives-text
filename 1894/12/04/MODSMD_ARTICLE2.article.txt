# The 						Freshman Team.
## 
### 
The freshman teams lined up last
night fur their first real practice game
in preparation for their contest with
the Berkeley freshmen on Saturday
next. There were two full elevens out,
and they played like veterans. The
men seem to realize that there is a very
short time in which to get into condi
tion for an event that ranks second only
to the great game between the Varsity
teams. The Berkeley men are un
doubtedly working like Trojans in an
endeavor to win this game, which is
their only opportunity of regaining
some of their lost laurels in the football
line. It behooves every good college
man to be on hand at the daily practice
and urge on the men to their best work.
The game put up last night was fully
as interesting as the majority of the
Varsity practice games, and well worth
seeing.
The work showed that there is some
excellent material in the class of ninety
eight. The material is raw, however,
and needs considerable training to de
velop it.
THE PRACTICE.
The men appeared on the oval about
four o'clock and practiced signals fora
half-hour. Clcmans had charge of the
coaching of the first team and was as
sisted by Reynolds, Ilazzard, and
Spalding. Downing urged the pccotid

team to its best work. The men lined
up quickly and played with a snap that
would do credit to a varsity team in its
best condition.
Few of the spectators last night were
aware they were witnessing one of the
most graceful deeds ever enacted on a
football field. Before the game had
proceeded far, one of the players on the
first eleven who has a line record and
is supposed to be one of the best play
ers in his class, conceived the idea that
the man opposite him, who is compara
tively unknown, was playing better
football than he himself, and stepping
up to the captain informed him of the
fact, and asked to change places with
the second team man.
The most brilliant plajs of the day
were the long runs of Soper, Carter,
Durham, and Nieewonger.
Jii I lard, a new man, heavily and
stockily built, did good work at left
guard on the first team; lie is quick for
his size, and breaks through well
Frost, as left guard on the second team,
out-played his opponent at nearly every
point, and did more tackling than any
other man on the field. Hughes also
put up a splendid game. The other
men played a very fair game. Frazier's
arm is in no condition to play, and
handicaps him in his work.
