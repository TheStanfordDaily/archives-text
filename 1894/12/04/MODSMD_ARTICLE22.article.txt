There were over two thousand paid
admissions to the California on Thurs
day night. This is too many for the
quality of the play.
A petition was presented yesterday
to the Supervisors of Santa Clara
County asking that a new township be
formed from a part of Mayfield town
whip and that it be called Stanford.
Prof, lloss will speak this evening
not on " Darwin and Darwinism" as
erroneously announced last evening,
but on "Dollars and Darwinism." The
lecture will be economic, not biological.
Owing to connections having to be
made for the new water system, the
water will be shut off all day tomorrow,
ou the University campus.
