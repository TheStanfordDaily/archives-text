## 
### 
A host of names have been sent down
of possible players in Saturday's game.
The most likely players are given below,
Avery Hockheimer
Jhiker Julicn
Blasingamc Laubersheimer
Chickering Laws
Creed Oliver
Crosby Sperry
Dozier, M. Jr. Pierce
Ebright Wedemeyer
Frick Wignon
Wilbur
Berkeley has finally concluded not to
play Porter, a graduate of several year's
standing. If appearances are correct,
and all indications tend to prove that
they are, Berkeley has not been acting
the part of an honorable and worthy
opponent in the matter of selecting her
players. It is reported that Wilbur,
who is at present a member of the Oak
land High School, will play on the team.
Although a member of another school,
lie has yet registered at the Hopkins
Art School in San Francisco in order
to become a member of the Freshman
team and has already joined the Ath
letic team for his well known abilities
in weight throwing. It is a known fact
that lie took the entrance examinations
for Berkeley this fall and failed in them,
and Berkeley, rather than lose his

valuable services, has induced him to
register at the Art Institute in order
that he may seem to qualify for the
team.
It is further reported that a student
named Nahl, who is at present attend
ing a preparatory school at Alameda, was
offered the same inducements, but re
fused them. If these reports be true,
it shows a condition of affairs that the
Berkeley managers may well be ashamed
j of. Manager Hicks goes to the city
| tomorrow, and will find out all that he
| can concerning the men and their eli
| gibility.
