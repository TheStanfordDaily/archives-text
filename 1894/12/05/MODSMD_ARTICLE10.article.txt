Tub law lecture tomorrow evening
will be of great interest. Mr. Free
r.ian, the lecturer, is a noted lawyer,
both for liis powers at the bar and
for Liis authoritative law text books.
He is not a college man, and further
more the occasion of his visit here
will be the first time ho has ever set
foot in any college or university
whatever; and this in spite of the
fact that fora quarter of a century
he has lived almost under the shadow
of what was, until the founding of
Stanford, the greatest university in
the West.
