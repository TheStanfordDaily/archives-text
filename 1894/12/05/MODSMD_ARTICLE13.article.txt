The original draft of the Constitu
tion of the Associated Students pro
vided fora remuneration to be given
t<> tlie football manager. The clause
reiul follows:

The football manager shall receive
the following percentage of net prof
its derived during the season from
the football team: Forty per cent of
the first $500, twenty-five per cent
of the second $500, and fifteen per
cent of all above .$lOOO.
This clause was not present in the
constitution as finally adopted. It is
better that such was the case, since the
football manager's reward would
have been three hundred and twenty
five dollars, a sum much larger than
can be afforded this year. But the
fact that a clause providing for the
remuneration of the manager should
have been presented to the student
body for acceptance, shows*that the
idea that some return should be
made to the football manager for
successful work is of old standing,
and has heen favorably considered
by many.
In view of these facts and of the
successful outcome of this year's
management, it would be establish
ing a graceful precedent, if the Ath
letic Committee would vote a respect
able sum for the purchase of some
suitable token of their appreciation
of the manager's fidelity and success.
