# Societies at Harvard and Yale.
## 
### 
At Harvard there are two societies
ut Â»reat note and prominence; the Hasty
Pudding Club, composed of eighty-five
men from the junior and senior classes,
and The Institute of 1770, a sophomore
society of one hundred men.
Vale has her Phi Beta Kappa into
which men who attain only a certain
tirade in their studies are admitted; and
three senior societies called Skull and
Hones, Scroll and Key, and The Wolf's
Head.
Each one takes in fifteen men, so
that there are only forty-five in all.
The election is carried on in a curious
manner. Near the last night of the
junior year all the members of that, class
congregate in a large space. In a short
time, forty-five members of these three
societies emerge from different direct
ions. Each man peeps about until he
sees the man whom he wants to t,;ike
his place, to whom he indicates the
societies' intention in a prescribed way.
Membership in these societies is held a
great honor and is eagerly sought for.
