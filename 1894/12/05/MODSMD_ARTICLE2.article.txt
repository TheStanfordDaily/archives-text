# On the Gridiron.

Yesterday again the crowd that came
out to watch the practice game was
small. Those who were present, never
theless, seemed to appreciate the play
( rs' efforts and heartily applauded the
good plays. About four o'clock, after
having practiced signals fora short
time, the teams lined up for the regu
lar practice. The coaches were out in
force and managed to keep the men
on the "jump" all the time.
Fickert played guard on the second
team and caused considerable amuse
ment by the ease with which he made
a touchdown after procuring the ball on
a fumble.
Piatt at center on the regular team
played a comparatively hard game, lie
is very strong but rather light in weight.
Harrington, at guard, played a fair
game. Frost played tackle on the sec
ond team and does not seem as well fit
ted for that position as for guard; his
tackling though was good. J^iHard
played a strong game, getting into the
plays very well. Pauley played the
best end on the field. Allan's passing
is apt, to be too slow and he is also slow
in getting into the interference; theso

faults can be easily overcome, however.
Carter played a brilliant game at half. 1
Dole and Nicewonger also ran well.
The team's greatest need is fora good
j kicker. Soper, it is claimed, will not
jbe allowed to play. This is a great
i blow, os no one else is prepared to take
1 his place. Allan was tried at full last
l 1 .... i
night, but his kicking is at present in
adequate. Dole made one or two good
punts but is not sure. Allan made
some good runs in a scattered field.
