# LECTURE BY DR. ROSS.
## "Dollars and Darwinism." 
### 
The popularity of Pr. Ross a.s a lec
turer was evidenced last night in spite
of the fact that very little notice had 1
been given of the lecture. The subject
treated of the struggle for financial
I supremacy. The substance of the lec- 1
ture is given in the following para- i
| graphs:
The results of an examination byj
.... I
1 statisticians in charge ola mortgage in
i vestigation, show that nine per cent. |
I of the families in the United States own !
| seventy-one per cent, of the wealth.:
i Investigations by tlie New York Tri
bune show that nearly four thousand live
| hundred millionaires are c3ch possessed
j of an average of $3,000,000. Now is j
| this inequality of possession increasing!
| or diminishing? We believe that it is j
increasing. Bryce in his " American
j Commonwealth," predicts that at the j
j present rate of increase there will be in
j fifty years more wealthy men in America
than in all the rest of the civilized world
J combined. In 18f>5, there were not j
j more than two hundred millionaires in
the whole country, and these were con
sidered very wonderful.
Of about four thousand millionaires,'
! over eight, hundred derived tiioir in
comes from land speculation. Men who
j are able to anticipate an influx of pop-j
j ulation into a certain district are able
1 to make vast, sums of money by taking
! up government land or buying it for
! little or nothing. Monopoly is another
j fruitful source of these vast fortunes. !
i Great trusts can combine and squeeze
miles out of the people the total ol '
J which runs into the millions. Most
j American fortunes, however, have been
made out of railroads, lands, monopolies,
mines, and the like.
Finally, competition itself is a fright
ful source of inequality in a nation.
| The worst aspect of this is, that com-1
I petition is all the time getting more
J and more severe, and for that reason
success and failure are coming to de
peud more on slight things. The differ
ences between men are constantly being
emphasized in the increasing difference
| in economic reward.
Some of the effects of this inequality
in wealth show themselves in the lux
urious life of the wealthy, in the class
I of the idle rich, and the idle pauper.
I Then the concentration of wealth
1 tramples upon the health and family
J development of ordinary people; it tends
' to lower them relatively to the richer
j classes, and tends to form a caste based
' on differences in wealth, and these in
their turn give rise to envy, malice, jeal
ousy, and strife. This results in the end
in social instability and disorder. Look
ing at (his aspect of affairs from an eth
ical point of view, our instincts do not
approve of such extreme inequality of
possession. We believe that "he who
works not, neither shall he eat." Hut
still we believe that to him who earns
should belong that which he earns,
! whether it be '$10,000 or $10,000,000.

Then, too, comes in the protest from
biology, which has been exemplified by
Kidd in his "Social Evolution." In
equality of possession is necessary i:i
order to secure human advancement.
Clear down the whole range of life we
find the advance of new species com
ing about by natural selection. With
man those best endowed live, while
those with poor qualities are killed off.
This process of shoving the weak or
worthless ones asido is nothing more
than the process of industrial competi
tion. Industrial competition is the
strugglo for superior incomes. Men
are not struggling so much for bread os
for jam on the bread. Natural select
ion, therefore, exists in society and is
important, but it is not absolutely nec
essary. The cure for the evils that lie
in an extreme concentration of wealth
is to be sought for in an alteration of
individual characters and in an im
provement of their social environment.
