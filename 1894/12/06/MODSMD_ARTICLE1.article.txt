# THE 						NEW BASEBALL GROUNDS.
## Site Chosen to the Northeast of Gymnasiumâ€”Will Be Ready by January. 
### 
When Baseball Manager Zion was in
terviewed this afternoon several inter
esting items were disclosed. For some
time past it has been felt that the field
inside the oval was too small, since it
was necessary for the out-fielders to
cross the track repeatedly tor llys and
fouls. It was also difficult to drain it
properly, and on the whole the team
and spectators were hampered by the
field being in such close quarters.
The site on which work is to begin
at once lies between Encina gymnasium
and llice's store. The field is at present
plowed up and prepared for grain, but
the authorities have granted the neces
sary permission, so 110 difficulty will
arise on that score. The field will run
diagonally from the road to the gym
nasium; the line from plate to box wid
be on a line from the gjtn. to the Co-op.
Arrangements have been made to
drain it by live lines of tiles running in
a convergent direction to and into the
excavation east, of the quadrangle. The
diamond will have a coating of loam
from four to twelve inches thick in
order to secure the proper grade. The
outfield will be harrowed and rolled
and coated with sand one or two inches
deep. A large backstop will be erected
and space enough left fora grandstand
behind it.
The field has been suiveyed by stud
ets in the engineering department
under the supervision of " Sosh," who
h'is bad some experience in surveying.
While it appears that the site is all
that can be desired for baseball, it seems
to have some drawback from a specta
tor's point of view. It is removed from
the other athletic grounds, and has no
desirable place to build a creditable
grandstand, an indispensable accom
paniment of a trood baseball field.
It is expected that the field will be
completed by January first; up to the
present no contracts have been let, but
estimates have been submitted from
different persons desiring the work.
