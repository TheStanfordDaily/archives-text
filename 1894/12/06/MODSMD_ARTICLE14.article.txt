Whetheb the freshman team wins
or loses in the game next Saturday,
ti e inauguration of the annual fresh
man game is to be commended. Qui'e
a number of good men who other
wise might have never played foot
ball have been brought out by its
means. To see so many sturdy
players and such dashing play as
the two freshman elevens put up
certainly augurs well for the future
of football at Stanford.
