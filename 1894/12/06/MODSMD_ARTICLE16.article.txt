The desire to see our team play
the I'niversity of Chicago teum seems
general among both the students
and the faculty. The good to be
derived from such a game is easily
seen. The comparative strength of
the teams of the Coast and those of!
the East can only be conjectured at j
present. We consider our teams!
quite strong; but a partisan of any
little college in the middle Wesi
thinks its team is but little weaker
Stage's team is Jin excellent one this
}e*r. In the Thanksgiving game;
with Michigan it scored 4 to its op
ponents' (5. Michigan had pre-j
viously defeated Cornell, and Corin-ll

bad scored in games r.gainst both
Harvard and Princeton. The bigb
standing of tho University of Chicago
team is proved. A creditable show
ing against it would give the Stan
ford team an Eastern reputation.
