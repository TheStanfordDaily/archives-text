The effect of starting on enter ;
prises which are bound to grow,!
without first having a definite plan j
which provides for this growth and
expansion, is shown by the present
state of our athletic grounds, The
large tield at the rear of Encina can
only allow of tennis courts and run
niug tracks. There is plenty ol
space there, but the woy in which it
has been laid out allows too man}'
useless corners The eiraight-away
and the oval run diagonally from
the road, wasting a large corner ne r
the road and spoiling the space be
tween the tennis courts and tho
track. It would be well to give
care'v.l reconsideration of the site
for the baseball grounds before any
expense is incurred. Up to the pres
ent time our tracks and lields have
been changed several times, necessi
tating heavy expense each time. No
more frittering of this description
cau be tolerated; and the only way to
avoid it, is to be reasonably certain
that when a change is made it is a
beneficial one and a comparatively
liual one.
