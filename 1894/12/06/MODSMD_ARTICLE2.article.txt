# COMMITTEE ON STUDENTS' GUILD.
## Plans for a Permanent Organization. They Will Be Submitted to the Student Body Next Week. 
### 
The committee appointed to prepare
plans for a permanent organization of
the Students' Guild met this afternoon
nt 8:30 o'clock. The necessity of find
ing something more stable than t lie
present system was discussed. The
present way of assisting sick students
impressed the committee as nothing
more than an unsatisfactory and in
adequate expedient.
The committee proposed this after
noon to prepare a scheme and lay it
1 efore the student body for acceptance,
by which a number of trustees may be
fleeted by the students and who shall
be duly incorporated according to the

laws of California. This would em
power them to hold money and property
in a legal way. This body of trustees
would also be required to find a means
for raising funds for the provision of
a hospital if such is found necessary.
The whole scheme is yet in embryo,
but it will be matured with the greatest
possible diligence. A full statement of
the detailed plan as proposed by the
committee will be published after its
next meeting, which will be held on
Monday afternoon.
