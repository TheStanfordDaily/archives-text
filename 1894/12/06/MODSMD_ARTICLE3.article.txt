The freshman practice last light was
rather loose. The men seemed to lack
all spirit, and seemed to depend on one
or two to do all the work. Today's
practice is tlieir last, arid should be
marked by good, hard, conscientious
work if we intend to win.
The men lined up in the gym. about
7 o'clock last night as usual, and went
through the signal practice. They seem
to have developed fair interference in
the practice, but ir. remains to be seen
whether or not this will hold together
against the rushes of the Berkeley team.
It, is a difficult matter to make a pre
diction as to the result of Saturday's
game.
There is no means of judging of the
strength of the U. C, team, arid the
capability of our own is still an un
known quantity. Several of the enndi
dates are splendid players, but the
majority of the men- are new at the
game and cannot be expected to play
like veterans.
Carle played center on the first team.
His work was quite good when we con
sider the fact that he had the giant
Uazzard as ari opponent. Pauley, as
end, played a fine game. Cotton and
Lilian! were the other line men who
carried off the honors. Frost and
Wagner did very well but failed to get
into the interference. Allan and Fmzier
were able, with Hazzard's aid, to make
good gains through the center. JN'ice
wonger, Dole and Carter made some
good runs.
