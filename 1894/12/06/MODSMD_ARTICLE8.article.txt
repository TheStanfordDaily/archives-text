## The 						Glee Club. 
### 
Although it. has been generally under
stood that the Glee Club goes south
with the football team, it transpires
that it is yet possible that no trip will
be made. Several members of the
Club do not wish to go, and come
(juently their positions must be filled by
others. No definite engagements have
been made in Los Angeles for concerts,
although fora concert in Sau Francisco
the California Theatre has been en
gaged. It is possible that concerts may
be given on two succeeding nights iri
the city. It is expected that the Club's
instructor will travel with them and
take the place of Mr. Haker.
