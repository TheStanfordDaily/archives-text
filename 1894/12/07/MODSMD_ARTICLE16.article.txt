It seems an impossibility to in
duce students to speak in class with
any degree of clearness and loud
ness. The college papers coir
stautly exhort, or employ inuendoes,
hut iu vain; each student reads the
exhortation with a smilo of lofty
superiority, and considers the sar
casm a great "josh" upon his
neighbor.
It is impossible to exaggerate the
c\il of mumbling tones, badly aitic
ulatfd words, and falling inflections.
Such work never has the desired ef
ftctof suggesting gentle femininity
in the girls or indifference resulting
from omniscience in the men.
