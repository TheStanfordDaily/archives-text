Something may be said about the
stipulations made by the University
of Chicago team. To demand
seventy-five per cent, of the gross
receipts is somewhat exorbitant
This would leave absolutely nothing
for tho home team, since a great
public game cannot be conducted
for twenty-five per cent, of the gate
receipts, This does not take into ac
count the expense of training and
tho other multitudinous host of
minor expenses. For Thanksgiving
Day tho expense of the game itself
was over two thousand dollars, a lit
tle more than twenty per cent, of
gross receipts.
Seventy-five per cent, of net pro
ceeds would not be exorbitant al
though it would bo a high allowance.
A guarantee of a thousand dollars is
a fair one, considering the expense
incurred by the visiting team, and
could be readily given without run
ning any unnecessary risk.
