# The
						Game Tomorrow.
## 
### 
Everything is in readiness for the
Stanford-Berkeley freshman football
game tomorrow. The men will prub
abiy go up tomorrow morning on the
llyer, and will be (juartered together at
the Pleasantoo. Berkeley is makiug
preparation for the game audit is
reported will put in the field a team
that will require the best efforts of our
freshmen to defeat. All indications
point to a very close and exciting game.
Berkeley is particularly strong in team
work, while Stanford excels perhaps in
individual playing. Back of the line
we are very strong with the possible ex
ception of full back, as Dole, who is to
play this position, has had very little
experience in that line and cannot, he
thoroughly relied upon for punts. The
probable line-up of the teams will be as
follows:
STANFORD. HKKKKLEY.
Carle confer Wilbrr

Lillard 1 guard r Avery
