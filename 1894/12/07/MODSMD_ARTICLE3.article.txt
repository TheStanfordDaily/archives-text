The playing was decidedly erratic
last night. The men seemed inclined
to take matters easy. The field was
very slippery and prevented quick start

ing, and entirely <1 id away with sure
tackling. The tackling was especially
poor. Time after time a man would
run half the length of the territory
through a scattered field, every man [
who tried to tackle him slipping off and
others refusing to even try to stop him. j
They also showed ignorance of the sig
nals. The spectators enjoyed the game!
immensely, particularly when a doughty
freshman would fall upon the ball in a ■
puddle of mud. That which caused
the most amusement, though, was when I
one of the ends became so rattled that I
he neglected to change sides when his '
team did, and continued tackling his
own men for several downs.
To judge from last night's playing,
the game Saturday will be a great sue- I
cess in a comic sense, if not from the I
standpoint of good playing. The poor
showing is due undoubtedly to the I
short preparation. Some of the men of
course did excel hut vvoi k—in fact
