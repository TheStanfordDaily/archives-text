" Oase Law and Jurisprudence."
I thought, when I was requested by
one of your professors to speak here this
evening, that what I would chiefly like
to do wuuld be to give you some idea of
the relation which case law, or reports,
bears to jurisprudence as it is under
stood in the United States and in Eng
land. In theory, and according to the
disputation of powers to be found in all
our written constitutions, you will find
that legislative and judicial powers are
reckoned separate. In fact we have
taken pains to distribute the three
powers of government —executive,
legislative, and judicial—into separate
channels.
There are large domains of our jur
isprudence which are almost judge-made
in the sense that you will hardly find
them expressed in any code. You may
take the branch of our law of which J
think we have most reason to be
proud — equity law—and you will find
it almost a usurpation of the judges.
For in nearly everything of that great
branch of the law, both as to jurisprud
ence and the substance of the law
itself, you will scarcely find auything
which has not been reduced to form in
the works of equity jurisprudence.
There you will find the at the very
beginningof things, constituting a sort of
rude outline to which you must add the
opinions of the judges.
If you were to examine the civil code
of this state, which expresses the prop
erty rights of citizens, and which a
practicing lawyer studies as a subject
for investigation, you will find a very
small volume indeed. When you come
to apply it to anything which is doubt
ful, you will find it inadequate unless
supplemented by judicial proceedings.
You must go back to the sources from
whence jour authorities are drawn, to
the decisions of the judges 112 rom whence
they emanated. lie knows not the
law who knows not the reason of the
law. In other countrks the system of
preserving the applications and the
decisions of the judges is not carried so
far as in England and the United
States.
An English statesman has said that
law is built upon the accumulative
answers of successive great lawyers. The
main part of the law is not legislative:
it is judge-made and lawyer-made.
It is therefore clear that we must look
to the decisions of the judges for in
struction in the law, and both as stu
dents and as practitioners must give
unremitting attention. There are
thousands of law books in use today,
yet when we come face to facc with
doubtful and perplexing cases we shall
find that our constant companion and
guide must be the learning and con
troversy which has been deduced from
the counsels of the courts.
