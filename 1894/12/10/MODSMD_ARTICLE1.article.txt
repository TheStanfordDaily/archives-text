# PLANS FOR ATHLETIC TRACK.
## Six Hundred and Fifty-Three Dollars Available—The Oval Will Be Completed First. 
### 
The original plan for completing the
track was as follows: A bed of crushed
rock four inches thick was to be laid
down first to give a solid foundation and
drain the track On top of this the
coarser sif'tings of cinders to Jthe depth
of two inches; then two inches of fine
°inders rolled down hard. The surface
to be finished by rolling in one quarter
of an inch of clay. This latter gives a
tough elastic surface, the cinders alone
being too loose.
Back oft.be two hundred and twenty
yard straight-away a nil stantial grand
stand was to be erected. Ihe whole
oval to be drained with two inch tile
pipes run one foot under the surface.
Estimated cost lor all, SI 170. Owing
to the scarcity of funds the completion
of plans will not be realized this year.
Everything that is done will be done
in first-class shape and along the lines
of the original plan, so that another
year the work can be taken up where it
is left off this year. No temporary or
unsubstantial work will be done, as has
been done in the past, and which
simply forms an obstacle to be removed
when permanent, improvements are put
in. $100 have been guaranteed by the
Athletic Committee. Si!sB have been
raised from other sources. This sum,
<?058, together with the ten carloads of
cinders given by the Southern Pacific,
will complete the 440-yards track en
closing the oval in first class shape, and
provide hammers, hurdles, shot, vault
ing poles, etc. If more money can be
raised work will be begun on the 220-
yards straight-away.
