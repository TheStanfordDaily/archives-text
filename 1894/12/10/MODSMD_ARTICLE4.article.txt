# Work in the Library.

### 
The library officials have just com
piled the following statistics in regard
to the number of hooks used over the
desk during ilie past three months and
their relation to the number used dur
ing the same months of last year:
HRPT. NOV. DKO.
1890 4610.. 6507 .. G460
1894 7599. .7225. .0692
This result shows that the hooks in
the library are being used much more
heavily this year than last, although
there has been a great falling off in the
number used during the past month.
These statistics, however, do not take
into account the immense use made of
the books by persons holding permits to
the alcoves, and probably do not repre.
sent more than one-third of the actual
work done in the library.
