# BERKELEY ON TOP.
## Freshmen Defeated by a Score of 4-0. Both Teams Did Good Work. 
### 
Lack of practice, team work, and j
weight combined to give tlie University
of California her iirst football victory j
over any Stanford team by a score of'j
4-0. The gamo brought out few spec
tators outside the college sympathizers.
The air was cold and damp with an ever
threatening rain. The grounds were
soggy and covered with pools of mud
and water iu which the freshmen wal
lowed in supreme ck'lijzht. During the
early part of the game, the yelling of
the sympathizers awakened some en
thusiasm, buttowards the end it dwindled
down to listlessness.
The teams were late in appearing.
They lined up as follows:
STAN FORI). U. O.
Carle c Wilbur
Harrington r g Winkler
Lilian! I g Avery
Cotton r t Kbright
Leavitt It Ferguson
l'auly re Hopper
Hughes le. ....... Julien
Nicewouger rh.. ...... Baker
Carter lb Dozier
Dole 112 b II ochei mer
Allyn (| b. . . . Blasingame
The game was uninteresting. Kit tie
team-work was apparent arid that was
by the If. (J. freshmen. Their line
men outweighed the Stanford men on
the average fully ten pounds. Neither
line held well and the result was poor
kicking. Dozier and Ilochcimer of the
Berkeley freshaien played the winning
game, Dozier bucked our left side
with impunity.
Cotton, Carter, and Dole made good
guins around the ends and at one time
carried the ball within a few yards of
the Berkeley goal. Our ends out
played the Berkeley ends, getting down
well on a kiek, but in all other points
the advantage seemed to bo the other
way.
The result of this game should teach
us a lesson. The freshman team had
been woefully neglected, having lined
up only once before against any other
team. On the other hand the U. C.
freshmen have had continued practice
against outside teams. The result of
their poliey was their victory of Satur
day.
