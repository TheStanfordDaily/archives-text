If Stanford beats Chicago on
Christmas Day, prestige secured from
a triumph over Berkeley will not be
a factor in gaining that victory.
( nly the hardest kind of work from
now up till the time of the contest
can possibly save the gume to us.
Chicago will send out a strong and
tx| erienced team, every man in the
pink of condition. There are only
two weeks before Chiistmas and it is
imperative for our men 1o go iuto
training immediately, if they seri
ously propose to play football against
A. A. Stagg and his men.
