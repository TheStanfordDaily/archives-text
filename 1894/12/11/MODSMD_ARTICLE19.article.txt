Attention is called to the prelimi
nary report, prepared by the com

mittee on Students' Guild. It de
serves a careful perusal, and every
one who means to attend the stu
dent body meeting called for its
consideration will do well to be
prepared to oiler suggestions us to
its adoption.
Fome such organization as is pro
vided for by the committee is abso
lutely essential. Students come here,
and those without means are taken
sick more frequently than others;
the reasons for this are obvious; it
is impossible for this community to
leave them without assistance; it
would involve too much suppression
of conscience, too much heartless
ness to be tolerated here.
Not onl}' for the indigent, how
ever, is this organization proposed.
All are expected to become its mem
bers, and all are eligible to its bene
fits. The idea is not embryonic, it
is full Hedged and fitted to meet all
that can be required of it. The pro
vision it makes for the erection of a
hospital is a good one, and is en
dorsed by the University authorities,
who are pleased to see any indica
tions of self help among the students.
There seem*? to be absolutely no
reason why a properly chosen Board
of Directors should not be quit«
competent to raise money enough in
a legitimate way to erect and equip
an hospital o f ' necessary size. We
trust that the spirit of enterprise
characterizing the student body will
endorse the scheme, and thus for
ever make unnecessary the constant
duus for subscriptions to pay the
doctor's bills of embarassed students.
