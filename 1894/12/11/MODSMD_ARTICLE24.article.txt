Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
Before any more money is speut on
baseball fields and track improvements
ihere ou»ht to be an investigation into
tbe subject as to whether the site J
selected can be used permanently lor the
purposes intended. Should we make |
an outlay of $1000 for the completion |
ot the track, and §200 fora new base
ball field when we are not sure but that
in u few years to come the site will have i
to be changed ? The proposed site for
•lie baseball field is on ground which
will eventually be covered 6y Univer-1
sity buildings. The athletic track is in ■
a cramped position, with little or net
suitable room fora grandstand such as '
the needs of coming years will demand, j
With comparatively little expense j
now the track could be removed to the
field east of its present iocation. Good
baseball and football fields could also be
situated there, and the site would be a
permanent one. It seems to me that
our men are not looking with an eye to
the future when they spend more money
on the present location of the athletic
grounds. Athlete.
