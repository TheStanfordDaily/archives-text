The following passages occurred in
the regularly reported account of
tliH Yale-Princeton game which Ap

the 2d inst. In speaking of Yule's
winning tactics in this game, the
Tribune says:

the centre on these special occa

through straight, and the other men

through and sending them toward

taught similar tactics, with similarly
successful results, wo hear nothing
but one unending refrain of "fluke,"
"fluke," "fluke," from those emi
nently impartial and discriminating
journals, the Chronicle and Examiner

journalistic intelligence, enterprise,
and fairness in New York and San
