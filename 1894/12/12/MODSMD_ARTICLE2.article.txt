# The 						'96 Annual.
## 
### 
The Hoard of Editors of the Junior
Annual met last evening and decided,
alter a thorough discussion, to allow the
fraternities to be represented by pic
tures instead of plates, as was the case
last year.
All the competitive wotk for the
Annual has been handed in. Eleven
poems, eight stories, and one farce con
stitute the literary productions which
will be judged by the committee —Pro-
lessors Anderson, Woodruff, and New
comer. Three designs fora cover were
submitted to Professors Brown and
Clark, and that of R. D. K'y, '9G, the
designer of 'Do's cover, has been se
lected as the best. It is superior to his
dcsi»n of last year in many respects,
and will form one of the most promi
nent features of the book.
