# CHICAGO GOES DOWN HARD.
## 
### 
Stanford Breaks Even, and Reliance Wins Handily.

THE EASTERNERS PLAY SCIENTIFIC BALL, BUT STANFORD WAS
NOT SLOW IN LEARNING, AND OUT-CLASSED THEIR
OPPONENTS IN THE SECOND GAME.

Manager Hicks was not slow in ne
gotiating a game with the University of
Chicago team when be found they were
contemplating a western trip, lie did
so with many misgivings as to the fi
nancial result, however, as Rerkeley re
fused to co-operate in the largo guar
antee. Rut the Stanford management
is $f)00 ahead on the deal, and our
eleven has placed itself in the second
class, while Rerkeley will nurse her
oblivion for another year.
The Christmas Day game, won by
•Chicago, 21 to 4, was a severe lesson to
the laggards who were responsible for
•this Stanford Waterloo, and we need
only point with pride to the 12 to 0
score of the following Saturday to as
sure ourselves that the players did not
need a second lesson. We offer no ex
cuse for our overwhelming defeat, but
can give causes for the subsequent vic
tory. The Varsity players were eon
j mrcd and implored daily to keep in con"
dition for the Christmas Day struggle,
bur. the Thanksgiving victory was too
much for them, and Capt Downing ap
peared on the oval day after day with
only his faithful moleskin to keep him
Three days before the game
•the men lined-up in the gym
nasium practice signals fora contest in
which the public knew they were to
meet certain defeat. The Chicago team
was flushed with success, and looked
forward to three straight victories on
this Coast. They went into every game
of the series to play ball and they did
so.
Three men ou the Stanford team,
Captain Downing, Franketiheimer, and
llarrelson may be given credit for hard,
-conscientious work throughout the
Christmas game. The rest of the men
seemed to play as if they were in a mere
practice game instead of defending the
championship of the Coast which they
won only a mor..h before so dearly from
Rerkeley.
The Los Angeles game with Chicago
tells an entirely different story. The
men felt the disgrace of such an over
whelming defeat after their even stand
in the first half, and went in to win the
game or be carried away in the morgue
wagon. Everyman on the team worked
like a demon, and each one left the field
with a halo of glory rather than the ig
nominy with which they trailed f r om
the Ilaight Street grounds on the 25th.
The grounds were in the best pos.
Bible condition and it was an ideal foot
ball day. The men were somewhat

sore from the preceding game, but that
did not last long after ihe play started.
Tlie plays which proved so disastrous
to Stanford in the first game were eas
ily checked, and it was Stanford's game
from start to finish.
While on the train returning from
Los Angeles, Manager Stagg of the
Chicago team told a prominent attor
ney of San Francisco that if he had the
material under his training of which the
Stanfoid team is composed, he would
not hesitate to contest with the colleges
forming the big four. lie admitted
the superiority of the Stanford team,
but was then quite confident of a New
Year's victory over the Reliance team.
In responding to a toast at the Reli
ance Club's banquet to the visitors,
(!apt. Allen said that he had been
fairly beaten and hoped to afford us
another opportunity to do so again in
the future.
