# A
						New Year's Victory for Reliance.
## 
### 
The score of the Chicago-Reliance
game could not have been made more
to Stanford's liking than it was. In
the first place it was a victory for the
Coast; on the other hand, though Chi
cago was still sore from Saturday's
game, Reliance was not able to make
as great a score as Stanford did.
Reliance played a great game. The
team was in perfect form and bore down
upon Chicago with magnificent inter
ference, which gave Reliance its fame
early in the season. Clem-its and Wal
ton did the star playing, making runs
that recalled sweet memories of Stan
ford's first years. Indeed these two
old Stanford heroes practically won the
game for Reliance. In that sense, the
game could almost be considered a
second Stanford victory.
The only toueh-dowti was made in
eleven minutes. In the second half
Chicago played a better game, her con
tinuous training beginning to tell some
what. Clemans, in particular, had been
exhausted by his brilliant playing in
the first half, otherwise another touch
down would have doubtless been scored
for Reliance. As it was, the game he
played with practically no training, was
nothing short of phenomenal.
The charges of brutality were,as usual,
largely groundless. A Reliance end
should have been ruled oft'once. With
this exception the game, although bit
terly contested, was characterized by
clean playing.
