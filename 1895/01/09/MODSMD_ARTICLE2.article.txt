# The 						Christmas Game.
## 
### 
The long-watched-for opportunity to
compare our football team with an East
ern one was afforded us on Ch list mas
day.
Stanford was beaten by a score of 24
to 4; but by the showing made in the
first half, it is sale to presume that her
defeat was due to a lack ot training.
The day was an ideal one for the play
ers, but not for the spectators, as there
was a cold wind blowing. As early as one
o'clock people began to throng through
the gates at the llaight Sf. park, and
by half-past two fully 2.500 spectators
were ready to witness the game. Be
fore the teams appeared, the spectatcrs
kept warm by beating time with their
feet, and amused themselves by watch
ing people step into a hole filled with
water, but which some practical joker
had covered with a newspaper. The
cardinal of Stanford predominated over
the maroon of Chicago, and in the be
ginning the jelling was in Stanford's
favoi; but after Chicago had made a
touchdown she received a large share
of the enthusiasm, the hickety-hi, hick
ety-ho, C-h-i-c-a g-o being frequently
heard.
At 2:30 the Chicago team trotted
out on the field and were greeted with a
round of cheers. They limbered up In
forming in a circle and passing the ball
to each other as they ran. Tliis novel
practice amused the spectators greatly.
A moment later the Stanford team ap
peared, and alter a little practice, dur
ing which time the captains arranged
the preliminaries, the teams lincd-up as
follows :

chosen as umpire and linesman
When time was called Stanford took
the ball and Kennedy Ilirsh

before he could make a gain. Chicago
tries wedge and gains five) ards. After
two more attempts to forward the ball,
Chicago fumbled and Spalding got the

side play. No gains in next three
downs, and on fourth Kennedy punted.
Ilirshberger returned the punt, Ken
nedy dropping on the ball on Stanfoid's
thirty-five yard line. Frankenheimer

plays and Harrelson punted, but by a

At about this stage of the game, the
first sensatioual play of the day took
place. On a fumble by Stanford,

and was out of the scrimmage before
the Stanford players realized what had
happened. Lewis and Spalding started
after him, and he was downed by
Spalding, after a run of about seventy
five yards, on Stanford's five yard line.
The Stanford line stood like a stone
wall in the next four downs, and the
ball went to Stauford within a half-foot
of her goal line. Kennedy kicked out
of this dangerous territory, and the ball
was in Chicago's possession when time
was called at the end of the first half.
SECOND HALF.
The second half showed the cflfects
of Stanford's poor condition. The
Stanford players appeared tired, while
the Chicago team was remarkably fresh
and active. They rushed the Stanford
line for five and ten yards at a time, and
had no trouble in making six touch
downs before the half was over. The
only points obtained by Stanford were
made by Frankenheimer. The ball
was near Chicago's goal lino when
Hirschberger tried to kick, but the
attempt was blocked by Stanford, and

Frankenheimer fell on the ball back
of the line. Kennedy failed to kick
the goal, and the game finished with
the ball in Chicago's possession on
Stanford's thirty-five-yard lino. Score
24-4.
