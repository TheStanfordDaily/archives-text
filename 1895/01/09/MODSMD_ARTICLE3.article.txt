# Stanford Defeats Chicago at Los Angeles.
## 
### 
Chicago's star rose and set with the
Christinas game. The Los Angeles
game on Dec. 29 gave the punters from
the windy city such a set-back that they
will puzzle over it for some years to
come. The assertions made by the
Chicago manager, Stagg, that it was
merely an exhibition game, do not find
support in the players who compose his
organization. They manfully admit
that it was a match game, Stanford won,
and won fairly. It was Stanib r d's day,
and right proudly did she use it. There
is one significant fact about the game:
twice only did Chicago get the ball to
Stanford's fifteen-yard line, and on each
occasion when Chicago tried to kick
our guards got through and summarily
put a stop to it. These facts show that.
Stanford played superior football, and
Chicago should acknowledge it as such.
The line-up was as follows:
STANFORD. CHICAGO.
Lewis Ie r Lamay
Cochran 1 t r ltoby
Fickert I g r.... Allen, Capt,
I lazzard c Wyant
Field r g 1 llullkette
Downing, Capt....rt 1 Knapp
Spalding re 1 Gale
Ilarrclson q ilering
Frunkenhcimer.. .1 hr Nichols
Reynolds r h 1 Kwing
Kennedy 112 b .... Ilirshberger
Shortly after 3 p.m. the teams lined
up, Stanford's ball. Kennedy made a
good kick-oft'. Kick returned. Ball
alternated between the two teams for
a while. Then Stanford's interference
made itself felt in steady gains. The
ball was rushed down the ('eld, and
before Chicago was aware of it, Ken
nedy was pushed over fora touch-down
lie kicked the goal. Stanford 6, Chi
cago 0.
Allen punted from center for Chi
cago. Kennedy and Frankenhcimer
distinguished themselves by brilliant
work, taking the ball to the center,
where Kennedy kicked to Chi
cago's twenty-yard liue, and there
a Stanford man fell on the ball. Chi
cago took a brace and gained repeat
e-lly. The ball went five yards into
Stanford's territory, and there Stan
ford awoke and Cochran, Reynolds,
and Lewis made some brilliant plays.
Time called with the ball iu Chicago
territory.
SECOND HALF.
Chicago kicked off to Stanford's five
yard line. Kick returned. Chicago
gained steadily, the ball reaching Stan
ford's twenty-fivc-yard line before the
onward rush was stopped. Here Stan
ford took the ball and placed it on Chi
cago's thirty-yard line without much
objection. Hurrclson made a splendid
play. Kennedy went through the ccn-
ter and Chicago stared longingly when
he, with the ball over his head, went
over the line for another touchdown.
"And Kennedy kicked the goal."
Stanford, 12; Chicago, 0.
The second touch-down was too
much for the Chicago men, and during
the rest of the half they played with
little spirit.
