The process of reasoning used by
S'agg in arriving at the belief that
the Christmas game was the champ
ionship game, and the others merely
exhibitions, is extremely puzzling to
us raw westerners. The truth of it
is that it was not a championship
gfimo at all. Chicago, with com
mendable enterprise, arranged a
Pacific Coast trip with three sched
uled games They won the first
against a team that had not practiced
since Thanksgiving Day. The next
two games were lost. Then Stagg
tried to retain some of his team's
fleeting prestige by the assertion
that only one of this series of three
counted. All that was only for
newspaper cffect. The (act remains
that in two out of three the Coast
teams proved superior to the Chicago
men. But it is to bo hoped that
their reception was so pleasant that
future years may see similar con
tests.
