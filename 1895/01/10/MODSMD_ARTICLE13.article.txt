ThÂ« baseball teams of the larger
universities will begin active training
about Jan. 15.
Candidates for the Yale and Har
vard crews are hard at work, and compo
tition among them is very spirited.
Since the new intercollegiate cup has
been competed for in field-days, Har
vard has won three victories and Yalo
two.
Although nothing definite is known,
it is rumored that lirewer of the Har
vard football eleven tendered his resig
nation as captain of next year's team.
Action has been taken by the Har
vard alumni to raise a fund for the erec
tion of a memorial to Dr. A. P. Pcabody,
whose services to the university were
of such rare worth. Circulars have
been sent to about 13,000 Harvard grad
uates, and it is expected that about
$5000 will bo. raised.
