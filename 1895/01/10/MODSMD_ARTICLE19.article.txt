The recent games with Chicago
hive strongly emphasize*! the fact
that, our one college yell, though ex
cellent, is not sufficient for all pur
poses intended. One yell uttered
repeatedly throughout a game be
comes monotonous. It tires the
throat, and lacks life and vigor. A
diversity of yells would supplant
this drawback, and a committee
should be selected by the Student
Body or appointed by its president
to submit a number of new yells for
approval.
