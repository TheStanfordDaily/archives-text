# Registration.
## 
### 
Two important regulations have been
adopted by the Committee on Registra
tion. Heretofore, petitions for dropping
studies or taking up new ones,approved
by the major professor and the instruct
ors whose subjects are to he taken or
dropped, have been granted without
further action, up to the very last day
of the semester. The new regulation
provides that after the first month of
each semester all such changes must be
specially authorized by the Committee
on Registration. The intention is to
discourage changes in subjects regis
tered after the work of the semester is
well under way,Â» xcept for extraordinary
reasons.
The second regulation is that with
drawal from a class without permission,
regularly filed and approved, will be
counted as a failuro.
