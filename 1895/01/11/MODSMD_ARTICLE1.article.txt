# Last Evening's Law Lecture.
## 
### 
The Law students who were fortunate
enough to hear Mr. Olney's lecture last
evening on Chief Justice John Marshall,
were agreed that it was one of the most
interesting and instructive papers yet
delivered here before the Law students.
The audience was smaller than usual,
probably on account of the fact that the
lecture had not been announced to all
those taking Law.
Prof. Abbott, before introducing Mr.
Warren Olncy, announced the receipt
from Bancroft, Whitney &. Co., of a
"pony" edition of thirty volumes on
leading law subjects. I his was a yift
•of the publishing firm to the lawl ibrary.
In a neat and dignified manner Prof.
Abbott introduced the speaker of the
evening, who was greeted with hearty
applause.
Mr. Olney is one of the best known
practicing attorneys of San Francisco,
and is a very able num. His delivery
is excellent, his enunciation emphatic
and distinct. The statements of the
speaker were listened to with marked
attention, and when he concluded the
outburst of applause testified his listen
ers' appreciation of his effort.
The following is a summary of the
evening's lecture:
Before entering upon an analysis of
the work of John Marshall in reference
•to the Constitution of the United
Mates, it is necessary to make a cursory
examination of the development or nat
ural growth of constitutions generally.
Most students have prefaced their legal
studies by the study of constitutional
law; in doing this the attention is at
tracted to the changes in the character
of governments. In olden dajs consti
tutional history as now understood was
unknown. Scholars at the present date
apply theories aualagous to evolution
in the study of political science.
Political institutions are slow growths
< 112 time and development of' man.
Institutions are made to fit man's
needs. Laws must be adapted to
man's condition and necessities el«e
they become dead letters. In proof
if this it is hut necessary to
point, to the changes in laws made since
the Elizabethan age. The whole fabric
of law changes, not ono portion alone;
and this change is noticeable in all
countries, but particularly in England.
Institutions are a growth, not a creation.
Unfortunately in some countries these
natural changes have been repressed
and an explosion caused.
Elizabeth of England ruled by di
vine right, as the people believed,
hence her great power over all depart
ments of the government. Elizabeth
controlled the meetings of Parliament;
she originated or approved its laws or
measures; she allowed or denied it free
dom of speech, and did not hesitate to
imprison members of Parliament to
gain her ends.
Under the good and wise Queen Vic
toria, bills of Parliament arc not vetoed.
She still styles herself, in accord with
custom, "<|iieen by grace of God," but.

the legislative and judicial departments
are completely separated from and are
independent of the ruler. This change
has occurred within the last three hun
dred years.
Our written constitutions are largely
modeled after the British constitution as
it existed at the time of the Revolution.
After the Declaration of Independence,
the various colonies adopted consitu
tions likewise modeled after the Eng
lish, which was the best extant fora
free people. Because it was written, it
is unnecessary to suppo-e that change
was arrested. The advantage of hav
ing written down the fundamental, or
ganic law will commeud itself to most
men. The wr'tten constitution must,
be flexible and able to be adapted to
any emergency, it must be framed in
general terms and contain only general
principles. It is a fault of modern
times that there is too much of a tend
ency to particularize. Under the great
men who have dominated the Supreme
Tribunal of this country, there has
been a flexibility given to law.
It is commonly heard said that "our
fathers l.uilded better than they knew
in forming the Constitute n," yet that
Constitution, was but a frame work
which we were left to clothe. The
constitution which is contained in fii'„
teen pages, has been interpreted by de
cisions in thousands of cases in the Su
preme Court of the United States. The
written constitution grows by judge
made law. Reducing the constitution
to writing does not change its evolu
tionary glow th.
Happily for us, during a critical pe.
riod of our history, fora period of
thirty-five years we had a supreme jus
tice who overtopped all his brethren—
a man whom we have come to regard
as a special gift of Providence to us.
liy Washington's death, Federalism
lost much of its vantage ground: fierce
partisanship ran rampant. There were
two parties: those favoring an English
alliance, and those favoring one with
France. In a heated debate in Con
gress over the Robin's case, there arose
from the Virginia delegation, in defense
of the stand of the Administration, a
tall, awkward, angular man, with a
large head and small, brilliant, black
eyes, lie was slovenly dressed, and
began his remarks in a hesitating man
ner; his speech became free and smooth
as he proceeded, and by his clear
logic the great John Marshall won a
famous victory.
On Jan. 81, 1801, Marshall wis ap
pointed to the supreme bench by
Adams.
He was born in 1775, the
eldest of a family of fifteen children.
School education he had but little. At
nineteen he joined the Continental army
under Washington, and reached the
grade of captain. He was with the
army at Valley Forge, Monmouth, and
Brandy wine. lie was of a temperate
disposition, cheerful, and a lover of
stories. At the closc of the Revolution
he was admitted to the bar, where his

phenomenal abilities soon gave him
great renown throughout the nation.
In his own state he was loved and re
spected by all. At twenty-eight he
married and made a most affectionate
husband: he revered woman to a re
markable degree. Everywhere his hon
esty, integrity, and candor, made him
popular.
Marshall was elected delegate to the
Virginia Constitutional Convention
though opposed to the apparently pre.
dominant popular will. By the force
of his arguments with those of Madi
son and his other colleagues, the Fed
eral Constitution was sustained. lie
was afterwards envoy to France, Secre
tary of State, and finally, Chief Justice.
.As Chief Justice he had a most diffi
cult task to perform. A written con
stitution was an innovation; the states
were jealous of each other and all were
suspicious of the general government.
There was little interstate communica
tion, and state pride was at its zenith.
These facts must be kept in mind to
understand the work of Marshall as a
chief justice. Marshall's opinions were
invariably regarded as just, and dissent
ing opinions were rare. Marshall was
loved and venerated throughout the
thirty five years he was on the supreme
bench, during which time he developed
our Constitution. Instead of the Con
stitution being a rope of sand, as some
at first supposed, Marshall showed it to
be a ligament binding us together as a
common whole, yet preserving the
state's individual freedom in all local
and personal afFaiis. In other words,
Marshall found the Constitution a
skeleton, he left it clothed in flesh and
blood.
