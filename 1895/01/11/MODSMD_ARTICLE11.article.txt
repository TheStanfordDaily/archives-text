# The
						Establishment of a Telegraph Office Uncertain.
## 
### 
J. M. Stowell of tho Co-op. states
that the idea of having a Western
Union branch oflicc in his store is still
in an uncertain.state. Tho Co-op. of
fered eighteen square feet of its floor
space for desk room and gave permis
sion that the wires should he run into
the building. The great amount of red
tape, however, that has to be gone
through with to establish a Western
Union branch oflice has thus far pre
vented the change. Undoubtedly the
Western Union would be a gainer by
establishing an office on the campus and
ceitainly the students would be bene
fitted.
