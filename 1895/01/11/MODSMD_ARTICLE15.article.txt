George Keunan, the celebrated lec
turer and writer on Siberia, will be at
Stanford Feb. 71h. His popularity,
swift-coming and long-lasting, makes
comment upon liim almost supefiuous.
Since bis articles appeared in the Cen
tun/ and created such violent antagon
ism in llussia, bis notoriety has been
wide-spread.
Mr. Kennnn struck a new and un
explored field of literature. 11c was
able to write ami speak on those burn
ing topics of tyranny, the Siberian
mines, and the Nihilists —topics which
at once interested warm-hearted and
adventuresome Americans,
However, apart from the dramatic
interest wc take in everything pertain
ing to llussia, and, broadly, to oppres
sion and restraint, there is an ethical
instinct within us —only the common
place emotions of sympathy, perhaps—
which responds to suffering humanity
iu a land and conditions utterly dif
ferent from our own.

Mr. Kennan is a kindly, warm
hearted man, as well as a graceful and
intense!)' interesting speaker. So we
anticipate with great pleasure his lec
ure in our chapel.
