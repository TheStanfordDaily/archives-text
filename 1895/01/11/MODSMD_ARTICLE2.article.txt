# Senator Stanford's Room.

### 
It is perhaps a fact but little known
to most of the students of the Univer
sity tliat Mrs. Stanford has lately
added to the already well-developed re
sources of the Museum a valuable col
lection of Senator Stan fold's personal
treasures, and of costly and expensive
gilts presented to him during the
period of his life-time.
The room was furnished by Mrs.
Stanford about four weeks ago. It is
situated just at the head of the broad
flight of stairs that ascend to the second
floor, and except when open to visitors
is kept constantly under lock and key,
the entrance being barred by a strong
and powerful safe door, so as to pre
clude the possibility of any thing' s
being stolen.
With the exception of three
which contain some of Mrs. Stanford's
personal possessions all of the fif
teen cases are (i 1 led with treas
ures and mementos of the late
Senator Stanford. On the walls arc
hung various records and souvenirs ol
(lie Senator's benignant and philanthro
pic acts, and countless resolutions
adopted by many bodies upon tlie ocas
ion of his death.
There arc also many certificates
showing the honors and positions held

by different members of the Stanford
family, among them being a certificate,
issued to Mrs. Stanford, of duly quali
fied membership in the Society of
Daughters of the American Revolution.
In the case to the left us one enters
the room, are contained many valuable
and interesting souvenirs of (Jen. U. S.
Grant, presented to Senator and Mrs.
Stanford by Mrs. Grant shortly alter
his death. Probably the choicest among
them are the coat, vest, aud shoulder
straps worn by Gen. Grant during the
late war.
The ca?es next to this are with
memorials of the ancestors of the Stan
ford family, anu with costly gifts pre
sented to Mrs. Stanford by various per
sons of note. Farther on the right is a
ease containing thirty-five scrap-books
filled with press-notices concerning her
husband, collected by Mrs. Stanford
from 1851 to 1894.
11ut, perhapsjthe most interesting cu
rios of all are the silver shovel and ham
mer with which Senator Stanford loos
ened the first bit of earth and drove the
last spike in the construction of the
Central J'acific It. It. Directly bu
neath them arc two solid gold and sil
ver spikes presented to the Senator
upon the completion of .the same road,
and lying near, tho silver trowel with
which he laid the corner stone of this
University, May 14, 1887. The case
â€¢lid contain numerous gold aud silver
vases and cups and many gold
medals presents to him upon
various occasions for the excellence and
superiority of the products of his stock
farm.
In the middle of the room is placed
the chair, heavily draped, which Sena
tor Stanford occupied during the nine
years of his service in the U. S. Senate,
and presented by that body to Mrs.
Stanford at his death. Near this is
the case containing the sword, coat, cha
pcau, and epaulets worn by him wliilo
Governor of the State of California,
18G1-G2, and also various rccords of
his (fficial acts while occupying the
chair of state. The remaining cases hold
a varied assortment of relics, coins,
autographs, pictures, cards, and letters,
which have come into the possession of
Mis. Stanford and which arc an im
portant adjunct to this fine eollcction of
treasures.
Of all the rooms in the Museum,
this is perhaps the most interesting, and
it will well repay one to spend the time
in examining it. It has been christened
"Senator Stanford's lioom."
