Native eons and daughters are
Ktill feebly protesting thiit this L
"the land of 6tinshine." Natives of
tho Stormy East do not question

title, hut, judging from the past
months, it would teem that it do
rives its name in much the samp way
that a street is named Elm avenue,
because it was never known to have
an elm upon it!
Let us be resigned in the comfort
ing thought that there will bo less
talk of irrigation and of a poor fruit
crop next spiing.
