# REV. HAWEIS' SERMON.
## An Able Discourse by a Distinguished Preacher.

*'o thou that. hearest prayer, unto thee
shall all flesh come."
W hat? Can this be true? All Flesh?
Look at David; he was a man of large
and varied experience; he knew all the
ways that could be known by human
nature; he lived in a very rouyh time—
he was a very rough man. Yet shall
we read "all flesh"? You may well
question this. We see about us young
men and young women who have sunk
very low; we arc ourselves all one sided
—and we are many-sided ton; wo put
on faces to appear this and that, and we
are this, that, and the other; our nature
is one of many sides. Yet shall all flesh
come to God?
Yes,* we truly must Times come
when we ftiust be alone with ourselves.
You lie on your sleepless bed and listen
to the clock tick; and there you see all
your failures, all that you would have
been and done,your shattered and totter
ing ambitions,and you count over toyour
selfall the hopes and aspirations—that
will never be realized. You realize
now the bitterness of your mistakes;
your soul is dejected—() thou that
hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh
come.
Aunin, our money bothers us so
much. You might think that the
question is very remote lrom religion,
nnd is very remote from humanity too.
It is not our money that is to blame,
you know; the Apostle never said that
money is a curse or an evil; it is " the
love of money " There is a story in the
bible about a Pharisee and a publican.
Who was the publican? He was a man
who scraped up money from every
source. Hut what did he do? lie
stood afar off, smiting his breast and
saying, "What shall I do to inherit the
kingdom of heaven?" All flesh? Yes,
all flesh.
We sometimes think that the man of
science, materialistic science, is not very
likely to come to God. lie believes
that all the universe is made up without
n God. The wise man has made many
an attempt to prove that, and although
he cannot, he still says there is no God.
lie says this aloud; the fool says it to
himself; this is the difference. We are
living in an interesting age; scicntistß
urc stumbling over a curious and un
explained thing which they have no
laws to regulate. We arc coming to a
curious border land where a strange force
is beginning dimly to show itself which
they do not understand; and a great
many scientific people simply deuy any
thing they cannot understand. They
say that the facts arc against us; this
of course is the fault of the facts.
Professor Tyndall once met with a
serious accident, and after recounting
the occurcnce somewhat in detail tc a
friend, the friend said to him: "Well,
Tindall, what did you do? how did you
feel? did you think? what did you do?"
The profess-or said, "Well, I prayed."
"What, no! how could you pray, you

who do not believe; to whom did you
pray?" Said the professor: "I do not
know to whom 1 prayed, or why I
prayed, but 1 simply prayed." O,
thou, that {hearest prayer, unto thee
shall all flesh come!
Well, now, you must pray. I want
to restore to you the sense of what
prayer means, the secret in the power
of prayer, Beforo you pray, you must
pray to some one. Do not be put off
with any subterfuges, with any apolo
gies. iMeditation is one thing, for
yourself. Do not be deceived in this
matter of meditation; do not be " taken
in." If a man is on the water and
wants to auchor his ship, it is no use
for him to cast anchor down into the
hold of the ship; he must cast the anchor
outside; he must go to the bottom of
the sea, and then he holds. It is no use
for you to plead for meditation; this has
but a small part to do with prayer.
You must anchor your soul upon God.
Prayer is the soul's sincere desire to
express the emotion of a hidden fire in
your breast. God is the postulate of
prayer; you must assume God Almighty
before you can pray at all. Yea there
is a God who hears prayer. You can
not prove it be science. Why do I be
lieve in God ? First and foremost, be
cause there is a kind of generic instinct
in the race that there is a God; you can
not get rid of God. There are all kinds
of isms, but in one form or another the
consciousness of God seems to be an in
extinguishable thing in the race. This
is very suitable evidenco of its own
kind; but why do I believe in God ?
Uccause when I assume a living wi 11,the
world at once evinces perfect harmony.
When wo assume the supremacy of a
living will, then all of the other facts
of the world fall into harmony more
marked than with any other hypothesis.
You students know that you must have
a hypothesis. This, however, is not
the ground of my belief; this is not the
reason why 1 believe in God; it is be
cause I am constituted that way. When
I look at this world with all its beauty
and harmony, I am hound to believe
that there is a God. God is a necessity.
You cannot live without air; you suf
focate, you die. So with God; he is the
atmosphere of the soul, without which
the soul dies. This is involved in the
very constitution of nature, (if course
it is not every side of your nature that
calls for it (although it ought to be); it
is the spirit, it is the mind, it is the
heart, it is the nobler side of your
nature that pleads with God. God is
spirit himself, and he must be spirit
ually discerned.
All things cannot be proven from the
materialistic standpoint. Philosophers
tell us that there is no proof of the ex
istence of an outside world; you may be
dreaming all this; how do you know
you see me? how do I know I am here?
Hut it is perfectly absurd for mo think
I am dreaming now. You may be
dreaming for all I know, but you be
lieve you arc not dreaming. Put ij
would be hard to prove all this scien

tifically. Because the sun rises one
day is no evidence that it will rise the
next, except as you believe in the per
sistence of force; but you canuot prove
it. We all believe in such a thing as
a moral scale, but not upon the scien
tific proof. Certainly one thing is
more important than auother. We be
lieve that the flavor of a good cigar is
not as good as a beautiful poem of Ten
nyson, or a great work of philosophy, or
a magnificent work of art. But, my
friend, how arc you going to prove that
the flavor of a good cigar is not a great
deal more valuable than the Transfig
uration by llafael? All these things
that go to make up the moral scalc arc
spiritually and affectionately discerned.
So you must believe in the existence of
the same as you believe in all
these oilier things which escape and de
ny the analysis of science.
Now, my dear friends, 1 will talk to
you about four things: the ground of
prayer, the manner of prayer, the
mechanism of prayer, and the subject
matter of prayer.
First, the ground of all prayer is con
densed into one word, homojenr.it/.
Hy this I mean that the need, desire for
prayer exists in you, in rue, and iu every
man. Is it not written that God
breathed into the nostrils of man the
breath of life, aud that man became im
mortal? The one thing common be
tween God and man is mind; mind is
conscious everywhere in the universe
and it must, therefore, be homogeneous.
The mind of God presses down upon the
mind of man, and there is a point of
contact, and all |flesh comes to God.
Man is mind, and hence we see the an
swer to the question, "What am I, O
God, that thou ahouldst be mindful of
me?"
Secondly, as to the mechanism, llow
does prayer act; by what means? You
cannot tell the arcana of this matter.
Some will tell you that it is a kind of
spiritual consciousness, but you cannot
analyze it. As the ground of prayer is
wrapped up in the one word homo
geneity, so its mechanism is wrapped
up in these two words: intermediate
agency. Do you not suppose that God
works through appropriate agency only?
Look around you,and you will see every
where the woikings of intermediate
agencies; in the growth of the trees, the
grass, the flowers, the fruit, everything.
So it is with prayer. 1 cannot unfold
to you, however, the great mysteries of
God, but I know there is an appropriate
agency in prayer for communion with
God; I know it by analogy; I know that
all God's dealings arc intermediate.
Thirdly, as to the manner of prayer.
In the first placc all prayer must be in
profound earnest; the affectionate, fer
vent prayer availeth much. Suppose
you want something from a friend. Do
you go to him and mumble in half-nud
ible tones, ' I want a hundred dollars,"
or do you make the appeal clear, earnest
and fervcut? Just so a great many
people pray.
Again, prayer should be constant

Christ said that man should always be
praying. What did he mean ? Did he
mean that he should be always saying
his prayers ? No; rather, that man
should always be in an attitude in
which he could turn on a momenta
notice, and lift his face to his Heavenly
Father, and offer up the burden of his
heart. When Confucius was sick, his
disciples came to him and said, ''Master,
shall we offer up prayer to the gods of
the ancients that you may recover? "
Confucius in his usual abrupt manner
turned and said, "Is that the proper
thing to do?" They replied that if
was so written down in the records.
Confucius turned away and muttered
to himself "The prayer of Confucius
is constant." Yes, men ought always
to pray.
Lastly, What is the subject matter
of prayer? What one man wants, an
other man wants not; and neither may
get what he asks for, although prayers
are often answered directly. Ido be
lieve, however, that there are external
answers to prayer. Do you believe
countless millions would bo praying all
these centuries for nothing? Prayer
continues because the experience of
people shows that they actually do find
in prayer a marvelous mechanism
which surrounds them with ministra
tions of peace and power. It does nut
matter so much what you pray for; God
will answer your prayer in his own way,
the best way, whatever be the particular
form or wording of the prayer. There
should be in every prayer the great
proviso, "Not my will, 0 l.ord, but
thine be done."
*'o thou that. hearest prayer, unto thee
shall all flesh come."
W hat? Can this be true? All Flesh?
Look at David; he was a man of large
and varied experience; he knew all the
ways that could be known by human
nature; he lived in a very rouyh time—
he was a very rough man. Yet shall

notice, and lift his face to his Heavenly
Father, and offer up the burden of his
heart. When Confucius was sick, his
disciples came to him and said, ''Master,
shall we offer up prayer to the gods of
the ancients that you may recover? "
Confucius in his usual abrupt manner
turned and said, "Is that the proper
thing to do?" They replied that if
was so written down in the records.
Confucius turned away and muttered
to himself "The prayer of Confucius
is constant." Yes, men ought always
to pray.
Lastly, What is the subject matter
of prayer? What one man wants, an
other man wants not; and neither may
get what he asks for, although prayers
are often answered directly. Ido be
lieve, however, that there are external
answers to prayer. Do you believe
countless millions would bo praying all
these centuries for nothing? Prayer
continues because the experience of
people shows that they actually do find
in prayer a marvelous mechanism
which surrounds them with ministra
tions of peace and power. It does nut
matter so much what you pray for; God
will answer your prayer in his own way,
the best way, whatever be the particular
form or wording of the prayer. There
should be in every prayer the great
proviso, "Not my will, 0 l.ord, but
thine be done."
*'o thou that. hearest prayer, unto thee
shall all flesh come."
W hat? Can this be true? All Flesh?
Look at David; he was a man of large
and varied experience; he knew all the
ways that could be known by human
nature; he lived in a very rouyh time—
he was a very rough man. Yet shall
we read "all flesh"? You may well
question this. We see about us young
men and young women who have sunk
very low; we arc ourselves all one sided
—and we are many-sided ton; wo put
on faces to appear this and that, and we
are this, that, and the other; our nature
is one of many sides. Yet shall all flesh
come to God?
Yes,* we truly must Times come
when we ftiust be alone with ourselves.
You lie on your sleepless bed and listen
to the clock tick; and there you see all
your failures, all that you would have
been and done,your shattered and totter
ing ambitions,and you count over toyour
selfall the hopes and aspirations—that
will never be realized. You realize
now the bitterness of your mistakes;
your soul is dejected—() thou that
hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh
come.
Aunin, our money bothers us so
much. You might think that the
question is very remote lrom religion,
nnd is very remote from humanity too.
It is not our money that is to blame,
you know; the Apostle never said that
money is a curse or an evil; it is " the
love of money " There is a story in the
bible about a Pharisee and a publican.
Who was the publican? He was a man
who scraped up money from every
source. Hut what did he do? lie
stood afar off, smiting his breast and
saying, "What shall I do to inherit the
kingdom of heaven?" All flesh? Yes,
all flesh.
We sometimes think that the man of
science, materialistic science, is not very
likely to come to God. lie believes
that all the universe is made up without
n God. The wise man has made many
an attempt to prove that, and although
he cannot, he still says there is no God.
lie says this aloud; the fool says it to
himself; this is the difference. We are
living in an interesting age; scicntistß
urc stumbling over a curious and un
explained thing which they have no
laws to regulate. We arc coming to a
curious border land where a strange force
is beginning dimly to show itself which
they do not understand; and a great
many scientific people simply deuy any
thing they cannot understand. They
say that the facts arc against us; this
of course is the fault of the facts.
Professor Tyndall once met with a
serious accident, and after recounting
the occurcnce somewhat in detail tc a
friend, the friend said to him: "Well,
Tindall, what did you do? how did you
feel? did you think? what did you do?"
The profess-or said, "Well, I prayed."
"What, no! how could you pray, you

who do not believe; to whom did you
pray?" Said the professor: "I do not
know to whom 1 prayed, or why I
prayed, but 1 simply prayed." O,
thou, that {hearest prayer, unto thee
shall all flesh come!
Well, now, you must pray. I want
to restore to you the sense of what
prayer means, the secret in the power
of prayer, Beforo you pray, you must
pray to some one. Do not be put off
with any subterfuges, with any apolo
gies. iMeditation is one thing, for
yourself. Do not be deceived in this
matter of meditation; do not be " taken
in." If a man is on the water and
wants to auchor his ship, it is no use
for him to cast anchor down into the
hold of the ship; he must cast the anchor
outside; he must go to the bottom of
the sea, and then he holds. It is no use
for you to plead for meditation; this has
but a small part to do with prayer.
You must anchor your soul upon God.
Prayer is the soul's sincere desire to
express the emotion of a hidden fire in
your breast. God is the postulate of
prayer; you must assume God Almighty
before you can pray at all. Yea there
is a God who hears prayer. You can
not prove it be science. Why do I be
lieve in God ? First and foremost, be
cause there is a kind of generic instinct
in the race that there is a God; you can
not get rid of God. There are all kinds
of isms, but in one form or another the
consciousness of God seems to be an in
extinguishable thing in the race. This
is very suitable evidenco of its own
kind; but why do I believe in God ?
Uccause when I assume a living wi 11,the
world at once evinces perfect harmony.
When wo assume the supremacy of a
living will, then all of the other facts
of the world fall into harmony more
marked than with any other hypothesis.
You students know that you must have
a hypothesis. This, however, is not
the ground of my belief; this is not the
reason why 1 believe in God; it is be
cause I am constituted that way. When
I look at this world with all its beauty
and harmony, I am hound to believe
that there is a God. God is a necessity.
You cannot live without air; you suf
focate, you die. So with God; he is the
atmosphere of the soul, without which
the soul dies. This is involved in the
very constitution of nature, (if course
it is not every side of your nature that
calls for it (although it ought to be); it
is the spirit, it is the mind, it is the
heart, it is the nobler side of your
nature that pleads with God. God is
spirit himself, and he must be spirit
ually discerned.
All things cannot be proven from the
materialistic standpoint. Philosophers
tell us that there is no proof of the ex
istence of an outside world; you may be
dreaming all this; how do you know
you see me? how do I know I am here?
Hut it is perfectly absurd for mo think
I am dreaming now. You may be
dreaming for all I know, but you be
lieve you arc not dreaming. Put ij
would be hard to prove all this scien

tifically. Because the sun rises one
day is no evidence that it will rise the
next, except as you believe in the per
sistence of force; but you canuot prove
it. We all believe in such a thing as
a moral scale, but not upon the scien
tific proof. Certainly one thing is
more important than auother. We be
lieve that the flavor of a good cigar is
not as good as a beautiful poem of Ten
nyson, or a great work of philosophy, or
a magnificent work of art. But, my
friend, how arc you going to prove that
the flavor of a good cigar is not a great
deal more valuable than the Transfig
uration by llafael? All these things
that go to make up the moral scalc arc
spiritually and affectionately discerned.
So you must believe in the existence of
the same as you believe in all
these oilier things which escape and de
ny the analysis of science.
Now, my dear friends, 1 will talk to
you about four things: the ground of
prayer, the manner of prayer, the
mechanism of prayer, and the subject
matter of prayer.
First, the ground of all prayer is con
densed into one word, homojenr.it/.
Hy this I mean that the need, desire for
prayer exists in you, in rue, and iu every
man. Is it not written that God
breathed into the nostrils of man the
breath of life, aud that man became im
mortal? The one thing common be
tween God and man is mind; mind is
conscious everywhere in the universe
and it must, therefore, be homogeneous.
The mind of God presses down upon the
mind of man, and there is a point of
contact, and all |flesh comes to God.
Man is mind, and hence we see the an
swer to the question, "What am I, O
God, that thou ahouldst be mindful of
me?"
Secondly, as to the mechanism, llow
does prayer act; by what means? You
cannot tell the arcana of this matter.
Some will tell you that it is a kind of
spiritual consciousness, but you cannot
analyze it. As the ground of prayer is
wrapped up in the one word homo
geneity, so its mechanism is wrapped
up in these two words: intermediate
agency. Do you not suppose that God
works through appropriate agency only?
Look around you,and you will see every
where the woikings of intermediate
agencies; in the growth of the trees, the
grass, the flowers, the fruit, everything.
So it is with prayer. 1 cannot unfold
to you, however, the great mysteries of
God, but I know there is an appropriate
agency in prayer for communion with
God; I know it by analogy; I know that
all God's dealings arc intermediate.
Thirdly, as to the manner of prayer.
In the first placc all prayer must be in
profound earnest; the affectionate, fer
vent prayer availeth much. Suppose
you want something from a friend. Do
you go to him and mumble in half-nud
ible tones, ' I want a hundred dollars,"
or do you make the appeal clear, earnest
and fervcut? Just so a great many
people pray.
Again, prayer should be constant

Christ said that man should always be
praying. What did he mean ? Did he
mean that he should be always saying
his prayers ? No; rather, that man
should always be in an attitude in
which he could turn on a momenta
notice, and lift his face to his Heavenly
Father, and offer up the burden of his
heart. When Confucius was sick, his
disciples came to him and said, ''Master,
shall we offer up prayer to the gods of
the ancients that you may recover? "
Confucius in his usual abrupt manner
turned and said, "Is that the proper
thing to do?" They replied that if
was so written down in the records.
Confucius turned away and muttered
to himself "The prayer of Confucius
is constant." Yes, men ought always
to pray.
Lastly, What is the subject matter
of prayer? What one man wants, an
other man wants not; and neither may
get what he asks for, although prayers
are often answered directly. Ido be
lieve, however, that there are external
answers to prayer. Do you believe
countless millions would bo praying all
these centuries for nothing? Prayer
continues because the experience of
people shows that they actually do find
in prayer a marvelous mechanism
which surrounds them with ministra
tions of peace and power. It does nut
matter so much what you pray for; God
will answer your prayer in his own way,
the best way, whatever be the particular
form or wording of the prayer. There
should be in every prayer the great
proviso, "Not my will, 0 l.ord, but
thine be done."
