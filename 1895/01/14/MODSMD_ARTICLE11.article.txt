It must not be supposed that the
debates to be held next Saturday
and Tuesday nights are in any sense
inter-society debates. Their sole
object is to furnish data from which
the judges may choose the best men
to represent the University in the
inter-collegiate debate.

bound to present the best of which
they are capable. Weak, scattering
speeches in these preliminaries will
tend to decrease general interest in
the inter-collegiate event; s'rong,
creditable debates will go far
towards preventing the compara'ive
apathy of last year in the matter of
the inter-collegiate debate from pre
vailing again this year.
