Tiie figures given on another page
of this issue, which are meant to rep
resent the expenses of students at
ihe University, are necessarily far
from being authentic. They are
published becauso they are supposed
to be a result of scientific work in
the Economics department. The
average obtained by tlie report is un
doubtedly a fair one, but the maxi
mum and minimum figures could
not be ascertained with any degree
of correctness without scanning the
expense account of nearly every
student in the University.
