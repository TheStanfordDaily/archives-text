Yale is to have a pavilion for stud
ents inflicted with contagious diseases.
Already subscriptions amounting to
85500 have been collcctcd and it is
probable that much more will be ob
tained. The plan is to have, if possible,

separate cottages fur the reception of
different patients; each cottage to cost
about 82000,
There is a great deal of controversy
going on at present a-; to whether Penn
sylvania will send a crew to tho lien
ley Ilegatta. Heretofore Pennsyl
vania has always been beaten by Cor
nell, arid if she decides to send her
crew to England, she will probably
have to do a great deal of work to get
together a first,-class team. The out
come of the controversy is awaited with
interest.
There seems to be a well defined and
positive sentiment in England in favor
of one or more international athletic [
meetings during the coming summer.
Most of the larger American colleges
seem to be in favor of the scheme, and i
it is very probable that such a meeting
will be arranged. The best plan as
yet has been proposed by Harvard;
which is that representatives of Yale,
Harvard, Princeton, and Pennsylvania
hold an intercollegiate field-day and
that the winners in this meet be sent to
Europe to compete with the best team of
England, chosen in the same way from
Oxford and Cambridge.
An Intercollegiate Daily Press As
sociation has b<jeu formed among the col
leges of the cast that support daily
papers. A meeting of tho representa
tives of the different dailies was held in
New York, Dec. 31, and a temporary
organization was effected with L. W
Mott of the Harvard Daily A'rica as
temporary chairnr.n. Tho constitution
is drafted set I'urth that tho principal
benefits of tho association will be " f l he
exchange of short weekly letters and
leading editorials, as well as the estab
lishment of a closer relation between
the papers in the association." The
principal power of tho association is
vested in an exchange committee con
sisting of one representative from each
paper and this committee elects a pres
ident and secretary of the association.
