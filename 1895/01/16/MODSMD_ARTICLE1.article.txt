# TREASURER HOOVER'S REPORT
## Of the Football Season From a Financial Standpoint. The Season Not so Successful as Many Supposed. 
### 
With this issue we begin the publi
cation of the report of Treasurer
Hoover to the Executive Committee.
This report contains the reports of the
treasurer, football, baseball, and track
managers up to date. A general sum
mary will be given later, in which the
expenditures and receipts of the present
season are compared in detail with
those of last year.
This is the fiist year that the finan
cial affairs have been thrown open to

the Student Body; and with this year a
precedent is established that must be
followed in the future.
In giving expenditures it is impos
sible to publish minute detail?, as such
would fill a volume, but items are seg
regated so as to give as clear an idea
as possible. Treasurer Hoover's voucher
books and detailed statements are open
to all those who care to take the trouble
to look over them.
