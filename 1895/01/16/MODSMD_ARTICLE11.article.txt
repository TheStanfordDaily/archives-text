The action taken by the college pres
idents of Indiana in regard to playing
football is uot regarded by university
men of the Middle States as a direct slap
against the game. It i« taken to mean
that the officers of the colleges do not
wish to sanction the playing of football
under the present rules. The clause
in their resolution which says that col
leges cannot play " match " games of
football, but that they may play "ex
hibition" games,is certainly easy enough
to get around, and will not prove to be
much of a stumbling block in the way
of future contests.
