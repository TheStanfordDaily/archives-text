# Dr. Boas' Lecture.
## 
### 
The chapel was comfortably filled
this afternoon to hear Dr. Boas lecture
on "Anthropology." The speaker
shewed a thorough knowledge of his
subject, holding the attention of the
audience from beginning to end, and all
who attended were uuiply repaid for
doing so. The substance of the lecture
follows:
The color of his hair and the color
of his skin give the American Indian
his most striking characteristic. There
are no other natural distinctions closely
defined, and it would be difficult to rec
ognize to what race the Indian belongs
if we leave out these characteristics
lie could very easily be mistaken for
an individual belonging to another race.
In a skeleton the breadth of face and
form of the nose would not enable us to
determine the race. We are satisfied,
however, if we describe a face as broad
or narrow. We must be more accurate
Measurements should be used instead of
descriptions.
The Indians of North America vary
much in stature. In the lower parts of
the Mississippi valley the tribes are
rcry tall, whereas in the other parta of
the country and in some parts not very
far from the Mississippi tribes, the In
diana arc short in stature. The same
rule that obtains in other races will ap
ply to the Indians: just as there are
short and tall people in other races, so
there are among the Indian tribes. We
must consider a great many individuals
in a race before we can fiud the natural
trait.
From measurement# of Indians we
find that there are certain curves rep
resenting the height of the individuals.
These curves are almost always ar
ranged symmetrically. From these
curves we find that the typical Sioux
has a stature of 170 centimeters, and
the breadth of the face is 148 millimet
ers. The breadth of the face in white
tribes is 138 millimeters.
In the mixture of human races the
tendency is not to produce the average
of human stock, but either one race or
the other. No forms representing the
average between the two arc found.
Theso facts are most important. The
average type is not really the character
istic type. Intermixture does not pro
duce new forms but preserves old forms.
The effect of intermixture and the ef.
feet of adaptation are the first consider
ations in anthropological investigation.
When we compare the American
racc with other races of the world, we
find that the Americana are more simi
lar to the races of Kastern Asia than to
any other. The long eye, the drooping
forehead, and the nose are common.
The Mongol hair, however, is coarser.
The peculiar malformation of the eye
lid varies greatly between the Chinaman,
the Indian, and the White. The fold
in the eye lid is moat marked in the
Chinaman, and least marked in the
"White.
We might fay in a very general way
that, the races of western America are

very much more like those of Asia than
the races of eastern America, If we
follow the geographical distribution of
races we will find that the types merge
by intermediate steps into each other.
The Americans are by no means a
homogeneous race.l
The Esquimaux are the shortest of
American tribes. On the Rio Grande
wc find short and tall races living iri
the same environments, the tallest av
eraging about 158 centimeters. The
Pueblos average from 160 to 161 centi
meters. The tallest tribes in the coun
try living in the lower Mississippi,
reach as high as 175 to 177 centimeters.
The Chcrokees, who once inhabited
North Carolina, moved to the plains of
the Mississippi, gaining thereby three
centimeters in height; so we may say in
a general way that the tallest people in
the United States are in the plains, and
the shortest in the mountainous regions.
In North America there are five dis
tinct Indian types. First, and the
most widely distributed type, those
found in the upper Mississippi b«sin.
The proportion of diameters through
the head of these is usually constant.
Second, those in the South Atlantic
States. These have very small, round
heads, but the same capacity as the
first type. Third, those in the interior
of Alaska, lJroad, short heads as seen
from the top. Fourth, those in Cali
fornia. Found in isolated spots, very
few full bloods. Narrow, long head,
and very low. Fifth, those in the Arc
tic recion have high heads aud greater
capacity.
The intermediate typea are alwaya
more variable than the regular types
The races generally merge into one
another, and the intermediate types
must be considered as mixed. Ex
treinc types are pure.
