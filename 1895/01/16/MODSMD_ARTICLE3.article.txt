# "The Birth of a Mystery."

### 
Owing to the inclemency of tho
weather, the lecture delivered by Prof
Matzke laÂ»t evening was not so well
attended a8 its merits deserved.
The lecture was a scholarly and in
teresting outline of the origin and de
velopment of the Mystery play in the
Human Catholic church. In its earliest
form the mystery was a reproduction,
in the pulpit, of St. Augustine's sermon
to the Jews and unbelievers, in which
he attempts to prove to them the ex
istence of Christ. This sermon, which
soon had many additions, was assigned
to different monks, who recited their
parts to the congregation assembled in
the churches on Christmas day.
The Mystery grew with time to in
clude a representation of tho fall of
Adam and Eve, the crime of Cain, and
various other of the Old Testament in
cidents. As the stage settings bccamo
more elaborate the play was pushed
down toward the doors of the church,
and finally out to the court in front.
In its final completion the play often
lasted for weekn, and even included all
of the 70.00U verses of the Old Testa
ment.
