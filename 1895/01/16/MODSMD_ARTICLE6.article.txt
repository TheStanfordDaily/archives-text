The idea of starting special
student libraries by class con
tributions as is now being done in
some of the History aud Economics
courses is douotloss an excellent
scheme Thtrj has been consider
able complaint, however, that those
who did not contribute were enjoy
ing the advantages of these libraries
equally with those who-e money had
purchased the books; that frequently
those entitled to the u>,e of the books
were unable to obtain them because
some outsider happened to have them
out.
Some simple plan could easily be
devised by which this trouble might
be remedied; then the benefits of the
special libraries would bo enjoyed
by the proper individuals.
