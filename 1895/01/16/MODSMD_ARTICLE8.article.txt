Last yer.r Ihc name of every stu
dent who had received a degree was
piiiiled in the Kegister ui:der the
head of graduate istudenlH. Whether
the degree was from Harvard or

from the Oregon State Agricultural
College, from Vassal 1 or from the
State University of Nevada, made no
difference in the treatment as far as
tbo llegistir was concerned. All
appeared as graduate students.
This can give educators in otber
institutions no other idea but that
graduates of those low-grade col
leges are accepted here as candidates
lor advanced degiees. Of course
every one here knows that such is
not the case. There are students
here now working for the bachelor's
degree whose names were printed
last 3 ear in the graduate lint. But
elsewhtre this Hide of it will not be
known, and Stanford will sulfer
from the unjust evidence of her own
Register.
Early in the present semester the
copy for the new Register must be
sent to the printers. Those in
charge of its compilation should see
that nothing so misleading is sent
out to the public.
