# BASEBALL OUTLOOK.
## Nearly Every Position Must be Filled by New Material. 
### 
The steady rains for the past month
have prevented the completion of the
new diamond, but as soon Us the good
weather commences work will be re
sumed, and the field speedily com
pleted. The end of the field near
Rice's store is to be graded a foot
higher, and a complete system of drains
will be laid. The field is to be covered
with loam which will be thoroughly
rolled, thus making a hard, durable
suiface. Manager Zion has sufficient
funds on hand to carry out the above
plans.
As for the strength of this year's
team, it wiil depend much upon the
material in '98. There are a number ol
important positions to fill owing to the
withdrawal of some of last year's play
ers from the University, and to the
impossibility of others who are here to
play this year. Walton, D.ivey, and
Bumiller, tliree of our best men, have
not returned. Harrelson, Sheehan.
mid Calhoun, will probably not play,
owing to the pressure of studies, as this
is their graduating year. The team
will in all probability lose the services
ot Weldon and McLuine. This makes
things look exceedingly dark. Only
by these men coming to the front can
we hope to place a strong team in the
lield during the coming season.
At Berkeley prospects were never
better. Instead of classing baseball as
croquet or other games of a kindred
character, as has been their custom
heretofore, they have made a change,
and baseball has taken a decided boom.
They will undoubtedly send out a
stronger team than ever before.
