An articlo on 'โข Expenses of Stud
ents at the Univeisity," which ap
peared during last week, has the fol
lowing:
Among the men the greatest
amount expended was $590, and the
smallest ยง24:"). At ltoble the cor
responding figures were $670 and
$268. The average for the men was
$392.40, and for the women $370.50,
making the general average $381.45.
These represent the expenses for the
college year of nine months only.
These facts are significant. They
show that the average expenses of
students at Stanford are considerably
lower than at any other of the
large universities. Itiseasy to ac
count for this. There is no tuition, fees
are nominal, and living expenses at
Stanford are reduced to the lowest
figure consonant with good board.
Euciua Hull is conducted on the co
operative plan, and board and rooms
in houses on the campus or in ad
joining towns is extremely low when
compared with what students at
Princeton who live outi-ido tho cam
pus pay for rooms alone. Stanford,
too, is a community in itself. The
nearest town is a mile from the Uni
versity, while the nearest city is fif
teen miles distant. Temptation of
all kinds is removed. These things,
of course, have a great influence on
the student's pocket. The wisdom
of the founders of the institution in
placing the University where it is,
is being demonstrated every day.
