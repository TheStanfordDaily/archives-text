A large and enthusiastic meeting ol

nine. Guy 11. Cochran was called to
the chair, and after some discussion it
was decided to elect officers. 11. S.
Dart of Rock Island, was elected cap
tain, and M. S. Porter of Chicago,
manager.
There is a rumor afloat that a cup
will be offered as a trophy to the win
ning state if a 112 cries of games can be
arranged.
It is hoped that other states will fol
low the example of the Illinois students,
and contest the place for championship
with them. Illinois will undoubtedly
place a strong team in the field. A
challenge will soon be issued. The
proceeds of all games will be given to
the Students' Guild.
