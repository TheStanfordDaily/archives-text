# That Government Suit.
## 
### 
It is believed that Attorney-General
Gluey will not bring suit against the
Stanford estate in the matter of the
Central Pacific bonds, but that he will
wait for action by the Congressional
committee on the Pacific railroads. An
article on this subject in this morning's
Call ended with the following:
So Mr. Knight does not know
whether an action will bo brought
against the Stanford estate or not.
From other sources it was learned
that the claim will be made that no
liabi ity at present can hold against the
Stanford estate until all assets of the
Central Pacific have been foreclosed
and applied to the satisfaction of the
delt. It is held that the laws of Cal
ifornia so apply to stockholders' lia
bility.
Such is the status of the case. In
the meantime the executrix, iMis. Stan
ford, has paid every other claim but
two others amounting to $lOO,OUO
against the estate, which now awaits
distribution. The distribution would
take place were it not for the uncer
tainty and confusion produced by this
hanging over the estate of the possibil
ity of these suits by the Government.
It can be seen how anxious Mrs.
Stuiford is to have the matter settled.
She has planned many large operations
at Palo Alto, and were Ihe estate dist
ributed sl>e would begin improvements
at once ( n the University. Iter idea is
to erect four important buildings cost
ing about SIbOOOO each, and an ex
pensive chemical laboratory, to be fol
lowed by a chapel and a library build
ing
IJesides these other extensive im
provements are contemplated fur the
University. The idea is to yive ac
commodations soon to about. 2500 stud
ents. There arc only facilities at pres
ent for about 1200 Then there comes
the purchase of the latest apparatus.
Fifty thousand volumes are to be pur
chased for the library. The employ
ment of many more professors for n»-w
departments will largely increase the
expenses. At. present the University
is maintained by revenues from proper
ties deeded to it by Senator Stanford
before his death. The present cost is
about $200,001) a year.
Mrs. Stanford has stated that all of
her property and all of the estate willed
to her by Senator Stanford will go to
the University, and that when the es
tate comes into her private possession
the revenues will be used for the Uni
versity during her life as they will be
after her death. This will s»ive that
institution a property of Sl7 000,000
which will net it over $1 000,000 a
year, making its revenue three times as
large as H-irvard, the richest of Ameri
can universities, and «rreater than that
of the University of lierlin.
