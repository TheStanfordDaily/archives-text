### 
No college yell is big enough for the
students of Stanford University, and
they have subrcsibed $500 fora "noisr
making machine" to u-»e :it athletic
meets. It is a steam horn-blower and
would scare a saw-horse. — Harvard
New*.
This report is the latest echo of one
started last year, which went the rounds

of the college press. In its final form
it stated that the horn was sixty feet
in diameter at one end, and was blown
by a fourtcen-horse-power engine. It
may be well to state for the benefit of
eastern college paper*, that all of these
reports are falsi.
