# A 						Meeting between Berkeley and Stanford in Regard to Athletics.
## 
### 
There lias been u feeling for some
time among tlic students and the faculty
of the University that there should be
some agreement made between Berkeley
and Stanford in regard to the eligibility
of students taking part in the inter
collegiato football games, and in the
other athletic contests between the two
institutions. Accordingly, Dr. Angel
and representatives of Uerkeley have
lately been paving the way for such a
meeting, which will in all probability
occur within a month.
Resides the many minor points to be
settled which have heretofore given
rise to dispute, is the time limit that i.«
to be set upon the period of any stu
dent's active participation in athletics.
This period will probably be limited t«>
h,ur years. As jet, matters in regard
to the meeting are rather undecided,
ami it is likely that many other poin's
concerning the contests between the
two institutions will be biought up and
acted upon during the proposed con
ference.
