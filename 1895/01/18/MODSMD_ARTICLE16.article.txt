It 1 ifts been inteiesting to observe
the result of the various nominations
of the pa&t IwÂ«ek. In our college
microcosm, we aro rot en'irely de
void ol wire-pulling and the art of
mighty Tammany and the noble
United States Senate, in a diluted
form. It is not always the popular
students, nor indeed the most com
petent, that are elected. Yet, as a
rule, a good-natured spirit is shown,
and we cannot but feel that in the
University, unlike in the "great
woild," our men are all picked men,
and all candidates aro worthy ones,
A noticeable fact in tho recent
class nominations is the naming of
girls for several positions in every
class but that of '90. Surely this
must, be an oversight by the Juniors,
for they bonst of gills of talent
and good scholarship, who have
won Ifiurtls for their class, and cer
tainly '90 men ate no ler-s just and
galiant than the Seniors, Sophomores,
or Freshmen.
