W'k wish to warn tho students
against a petition which is being c r
culated on the campus presumably
having some relation to tho elivMon
of Maylield township. It stems
evident that the movement arose at
th'j instance of a few disappointed
politicians iu l'alo Alto, just after
the election. The only purpose evi
deuced ut the time wa■; lo throw the
successful township officers in l'alo
A. 1 to out of office. \Ye are strength
entd in this view by the fact that the
three representatives who appeared
last Monday in tho supervisors of
fice announcing that their plans
were not ready and asking that the
question of division be continued
fora month or so, were tho three
men most active in tho election
against the pre ent .Justice of the
Peace in l'alo Alto. It is tho same
crowd that published tho infumou>
anti University "boomerang" on the
eve of the last election.
The only eff ct of that present di
vision of Maylield township can
have is to throw the township offi
c rs living in Palo Alio fiom their
offices. As far as cau be seen ihe
division would have no further effect
than tho throwing of a Stanford law
stud.nt out of < ffice. If there are
merits in the case, they should have
been brought out at some public
meeting held for an open discussion
of the movement. No such meeting
has taken place, and the petitions are
being circulated in a semi-secret
manner. In fact, t,Ve whole affair
looks liko a political log-rolling
scheme, and before signing such a
paper wo would certainly advise the
students and professors to demand
a inoro public attitude on the part
of thoso who have the matter in
hand.
