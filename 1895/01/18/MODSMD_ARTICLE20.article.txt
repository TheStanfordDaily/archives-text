Prof. Kuiory JO. Smith, who will res
urrect the defunct Horticultural de
partment here next fall, delivered a
vary able address in Sacramento yester
day before the Ametican Pomologieal
Society convention. lie Raid iti part:
What docs it profit the nation to
teach in the tehiols foreign languages,
political economy, etc., giving its chil
dren a professional education, when
throu/h such a system the cities are
consisted with impractical youthful
energy and the country is infested with,
and taxed to support, hull" witted pro
fessionals, while useful trades are de
serted and broid acres lie untitled?
The first aim of Government education
shmld he to mrtkc intelligent, self-sup
portinir citizens, and every county in
ihe United States should have its in
dustrial school. It is practical and de
sirable to establish by law one public
school in each county where elementary
agriculture and horticulture can be
taught. The Government should es
tablish botanical gardens with ample
support —one in the Northeast, one in j
the South, one in the Central States,
and one in the Pacific States. These
gardens, supplementd by the experi
meiral stations, would form an adtnir
ablc system. If the appropri itions for |
a few war-hips were transferred to bo-j
tunical gardens the money would do
civilizi'ion infinitely more good.
I'rdessor Smith dwelt at great length
on the necessity of establishing a Ireej
postal delivery sy-tem in rutal districts, i
lie thought the Government should do
this e u en if the co-t of the mail service
was increased. He severely criticised
Postmaster General Hissell for not re
«• ituiietiding the adoption of the system
in Lis annual report, lie also strongly
urged the pomolouists to work for the
ndoptiori of laws for the presetvation of
ihff 112 rests, and denounced the present
htws tlia*. permit the unchecked influx
of pun pi r nt.d criminal foreigners. The
tux which is now imposed on fruit trres
un depl ired by Prof, ssor Smith on the
ground (hat it is imposing a tax on an
increas* d value of the land, which in
creased va'ue diC' not exist until the
Iruit is on the trees. He suggested
ihat the state could save several hun
dred thousand dollars a year by abolish
log all the useless state commissions,
combining those of a scientific character
with ill.' established institutions of
Icarninir, thus taking them entirely out
of polities and political patronage.
It is to he sincerely hoped that, a law
will be shortly formulated and passed,
ab-olutelv prohibition speculation in
food products This is one of the
worst, evils with which the farmer has
»<> con end. If. is ganib ing in the
m >st h irmfiil form, and should not be
tolerated by the people
The consular system of the United
States is a politic.il humbug, and is a
fore burden to the commerce of the
ct u itry and often a source of mortifica
tion to travelers. Civil Service tules
should be applied to this branch of
G •vernment S"rvice. so that consu'ar
officers may be eonvcrsant wi h the lan
guages, customs, and ttade cr.ndition#
of the countries to which they are ac
credited. We cannot hope fur reliable
crop reports o* accurate iulurtnafio i re
tarding foreign industries until this
vicious system is abolished or improved.
'I I c professor commended tlie ex
isting insect laws; thought a pure-food
law should be passed; recommended
tlio protection of fatmcrs from swind
ling fertilizer makers; urged fruit men
to pack the product of their orchards
hmestly; and favored the bill now be
fore the Legislature which, if it be
comes a law, will compel each land
owner to keep the road in front of his
property in good condition.
