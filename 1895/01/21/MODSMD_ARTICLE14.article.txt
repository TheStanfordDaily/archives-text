Editor Daily Palo Alto:
There evidently seems to be some
misunderstanding among many of the
students in regard to the petition which
has been recently circulated praying
fora division of Ma}ficld township.
The facts of the case are, that the pe
tition lias been signed by every mem
ber of the faculty who is a citizen of
the township. The list is headed by
the name of President Jordan. To be
sure, he placed his signature there with
the express understanding that it was
not to further a job to throw a
Stanford Law student out of office, but
all fears in that direction have been al
byed by a leg:il announcement that the
tenure of Mr. Wigle's office will not be
effected should the division be accom
plished.
The persons who are most strongly
advocating the division scheme may
have been zealously electioneering for
some one else than the student candi
date on election day, but that does n<Â»t
indicate that they are not for the good
of Palo Alto, first, last, and all the time.
Their actions have not* been below
board in any particular, and if the
township is eventually divided it will
be because a largo majority of the free
holders and other residents in thn dis
trict concerned favor such action.
