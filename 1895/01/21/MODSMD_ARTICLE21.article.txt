The changed appearance of the
tank is a forecast of the beginning
of a new "rush" season. A word
to 'i) 7 and!) 8. Stanford's record
in the matter of inter-class contests
has always been clean and ab >vo re
proach. There has never been a
single case of hazing or brutality on
this campus. So long as tho under
classmen limit their contests to
harmless stiuggles of strategy and
tuuse'e, thero will bo no intcrfert nee
from the faculty. As soon, however,
as any elements of brutality or
malice enter into tho spirit of our
rushes, they will have to go the way
of tho Piinceton "haze"or tho Har
vard cane rush. The future of their
cherished sport is in tho hands of
the under-cla^smen.
