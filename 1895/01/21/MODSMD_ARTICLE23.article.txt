One of tlie most pleasing results
of Stanford enterpriso and competi
tion is brought before us this week in
the arrival of the Berkeleynn t which
has changed, with the now year,from
a weekly to a quasi-daily, presenting
an appearance in form and natter
which is highly creditable to its
edit jrs as well as the university it
lepresents. It is indeed surpiising
that such a step has not been taken
• efore. With the natural advantages
for the establishment of such a paper
tho co-operation of ilie Ueikeley
student body was all tlat was lack
ing. Jiut with North and Hirst at
the wheel the venture is in reliable
hands, and we feel safe in predicting
a full fledged daily before many
weeks have pas-ed.
The significance of this move does
not end with the heiuii:s that will
accrue to the school in the hills.
Of course it will four times a week
remind blue and gold supporteis
ihat they are alive. It will al?o bear
evidence to the rest of the country
that this Coast is blessed with two
cosmoi olitan institutions instead of
ono. This information may reach
no further than the college world at
present, but in tho near future a
gander re.-ult is inevitabe. May
the Jicrlit J' I/an deviate far from the
path of the late lamented University
of Chicng > Acws.
