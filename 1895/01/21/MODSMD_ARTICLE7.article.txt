a total attendance of about 20 0U0, and

In comparing the expenditures of the
two seasons the figures arc often neces
sarily not accurate in detail, for in Mr.
Maynard's report scarcely any attempt
was made to seggregate different heat's,
and a person unacrpainted with the ex
penditure may make sonic mistakes in
their separation.
