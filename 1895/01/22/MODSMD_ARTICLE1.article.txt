To the Executive Committee:
{Continued from Monday.)
The iuerease iu expenditures, it will
be seen, are in incidentals, medical
attendance, liand and decorating,
assistance at the grounds, athletic
goods and personal expense. The
increase in incidentals lies in
the increase of livery bills and
carriage hire consequent on the team's
stay at Woodside, the entertainment of
the Chicago team, and the increase in
telegraph bill forced by making all ar
rangements for the Christmas games
in that manner. Per a resolution of
the Athletic Hoard, the management
ibis year assumed the expeioe for med
ical attendance, Mr. DeWolf's share of
which amounted to nearly $100 03,
The Executive Committee decided to
allow the Hand expenses to the city
Thanksgiving at a cost directly of $53,
but indiree'ly 8Mi. more, for it was
necessary to purchase tickets to the
game for them, making in reality §09.
Items for decorating were §50.05.
This year an attempt was made to pro
vide in a measure reserved seats at the
Thanksgiving causing an in
crease of nearly $100.00 over the
method used last year.
The increase in the expenditures for
athletic goods has been caused by the
management providing for all who wish
ed to play ball, over fifty men being fit
ted out, or nearly twice the number of
last year. At the beginning of the
season but three suits were on hand.
We have now secured about fifty-five
suits, thus doing away with the neces
sity of purchasing any considerable
number of athletic goods next season.
The personal expenses have been heav
ier this season because the number of
men in the management has been
doubled.
To sum up,—The cost of last
year's season was $505100. The re
ceipts were 85564.00, a loss of 880 10.
On the present season there was a cost
of $0121.74 ; a total receipt of 80020.-
41, and a net gain of 8105.08. In ad
•i»tion to the cash gain the recovered !
property should he added making a to
tal gain of $730 00 for the season i
against a loss of $21.00 tor last season, j
There was an increase of 81037.10 in
receipts and an increase of 8773.83 in !
expenditures
II. Old Debts.—Old debts tol
the amount of $733.51 have been ac
knowledged and $408 01 paid. A num- ;
her of claims have come in atid have
been refused because of their injustice, j
Those paid have been carefully inquired j
into and audited, and the remainder |
will lit? satisfied at an early date.
III. Athletic Grounds.— During the
S' a>on 8001 20 has 1 e« n ►petit or set I
aside lor improvement of the athletic |
groundc; 8400 25 of this lists been for !
the track. $150 CO I'm the diamond.
Assets and Liabilities —The assets of
the Associ it ion ure largely in football
paraphernalia and improvements on the

athletic grounds. Of the former 8535
value of this year's athletic and other
<;oods have been recovered against
$04.00 last season. Of 8IOCO.OO iu
athletic goods purchased, £010.00 are
returnable goods, showing a loss of
$375.(0 either in goods used up or ap
propriated.
Improvements on the athletic
grounds have been made from year to
year now aggregating about $1390.00.
The total assets of the Association
are about $2000.00.
Liabilities—There remain outstand
ing items aggregating $000.00 against
the present, season and 82G5.00 of old
debts. 'I lie latter will be discharged
with the cash now on hand.
In addition to the regular work, th e
accounts of Managers Cox and May
card have been audited and the results
are now before the committee. This
alone has involved not only the going
over of 81800.00 of accounts, but a
large amount of correspondence with
out.-ide parties.
The volume of money hand'ed is rep
resented closely by twice — the receipts
and expenditures—the gross receipts
from games plus the outside income of
the student body—aggregating about
$40,000 00, which, in addition to the
outside business in connection with the
football would make a total of nearly
850,000 00 handled, Together with
the accounts of the past seasons nearly
$00,0( 0 00 of accounts attended to.
It is the unauiuit us opinion of all
who have been connected with the
management that, no considerable profit
can be made on football until some
other ground than 11 ui <j li t street is pro
vided upon wbich to conduct games.
Aside from the extreme inconvenience
and consequent diminishing of gate re
ceipts, the fact ihat the owners will
not provide :-uitablu arrangements and
will charge two prices for rent, robs us
of our profit from year to year. During
the past seasf.n we have paid $1,182 00
for the erection of stands and repair
of grounds and $011.80 lor rent. L ist
year the expense was almost as great.
Central Park might be secured if the two
Universities would enter into a time
agreement with the owner.
In conclusion I would call the at
tention of the committee to the lack of
provision in the constitution iu regard
to the custody or recovery of association
property, and would recommend that
something be done iu regard to the
matter at once. Meantime I have as
sumed the offiec on recommendation of
the A'hletic Hoard.
