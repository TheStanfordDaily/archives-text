The completion of the running
track is a matter which needs some
vigorous act : on 011 the part of those
who are in clurge. There are plenty
of men in the University who,
though they have never yet t-et foot
011 a cinder path, need but the op
portunity to show their mettle as
runners and jumpers. It is a most
essential part of a successful athletic
policy to eucouragi the develop
ment of raw material. Until Stan
ford University has a good runuing
track, bhe must expect a continu incc
of tho present apathetic feeling
towards track athleiics, which really
112 jrm a most healthful and desirable
branch of college sport.
