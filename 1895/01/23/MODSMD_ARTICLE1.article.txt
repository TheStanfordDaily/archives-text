# INTER-COLLEGIATE DEBATE.
## A 						Large Crowd and Good Speeches at the Chapel Last Night. Magee, Bledsoe, and Palmer to Uphold the Cardinal. 
### 
The elements seemed determined
during yesterday afternoon and evening
to prevent any audience from assemb
ling at tbe chapel to listen to one of the
most interesting debates ever heard at
Stanford. Notwithstanding the in
clemency of the weather, however, a
large crowd gathered at 7:30 pin. and
were well repaid for their pains. It
was noticeable that the ladies turned
out in greater numbers than the gentle
man.
Tbe subject of the deha-to wa*, "lie
solved, That the official referendum
should be adopted in California." The
affirmative side of the question was
i.bly presented by Magee, '95, Sheldon,
'00, and Brown, '00. The negative
xrgnments were skillfully put forth by
Piatt, '07, Burnell, '95, and Bledsoe, '9ft.
The attention of the auditors was
closely held, and frequent applause
greeted tbe remaiks of the debaters. In
every way the debate was a success, and
the assembly felt, when tbe event was
over, that we would be able to give
Berkeley a decided test when our
representatives are pitted against the
siippo ter* of blue and gold.

winners in the preliminary debate held
