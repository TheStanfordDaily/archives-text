Some students seem to have for
gotten the go id resolutions made in
regard to their work for this semes
ter after having scanned their re
cords lor that part of the year just
completed. The way in which stu
dents in many of the departments
commenced tho semester by perfect
recitations, even changing their
places of living in order to study
with greater success, mystified the

iiiso of the year concerning college
work were strictly adhered to, there
would be less waUe of midnight, oil
wLen preparing for tho next set, of
examinations. It would bo well to
remember the proverb, "A task well
begun is half done."
