Today the three successful c'e
biters are heing congratulated on all
sides. To be chosen us one ot' Stan
ford's representatives in the Inter
collegiate is no small honor, anil
Stanford men arj always quick and
generous in their recognition of such
success. This generosity and the
intensity of interest that animates
Stanford in intercollegiate contests
have had much to do with her vic
tories in the past. The indications
are strong that this year's debate
will excite more interest than either
of the preceding ones—that more
and more importance is being at
tach! d to this form of contest. This
augurs well for Stanford's fate in
the contest with the State Univer
sity.
As the importance of the debate
becomes better appreciated, the
honor of participating in it increases
in like proportion; but at the same
lime the responsibility becomes
equally greater Ou tho trio chosen
last, night devolves tho duly of up
holding the standard of their Uni
versity. In the two forms of inter
collegiate contest in which interest

centers it has never been trailed in
the dust If alter the next debate it
is not lowered in defeat, but, in
stead, jiguin proudly waves, the
tinee winners will have won tuoh
honor as slml! make that of today in
significant indeed.
