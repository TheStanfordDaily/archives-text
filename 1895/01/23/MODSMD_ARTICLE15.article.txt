'I he debate last evening was one
of the finest in till respects that has
occurred tit this Univeisityand testi
fies ui.denif.bly that we have some
excellent thinkers and speakers uitli
whom to match our opponent!. The
debate was carried 011 in a most
courteous spirit by the participants;
it was marked by logical reasoning,
and the merits of the question were
discussed | hiusibly, honestly, and in
a business like manner. There was
little attempt at stilted oratory, but
the dt livery of the speakers and their
self-control were admirable. A great
variety of widely divergent opinions
was held by those present as to what
debaters merited the judges' choice;
even body sÂ«emed to have a dif
ferent view from everybody else.
This tends to show that all contest
ants did equally well and there was
110 one who overtopped all others.
The judges were not long in
making their stlection, and it is to
be trusted that their selection will,
iu Ihe end, evidence their wisdom.
The clashes of '95, 'i)G, and *i? 7
each have a representative on the
debating trio which is to appear
against Berkeley. It might bo well
to re nark the advantage and im
portance of our debating and literary
societies. We have reached a time
when every man in practical life, no
matter what his occupation or pro
fession, is expected to be able to
talk extemporaneously at almost any
moment. Men of the world, es*
lucidly college men, will nowadays
find themse.ves curiously regarded
by their fellows if tiny cannot speak
011 the spur of the moment when
need arista. Therefore we should
encourage and foster our literary so
cieties, and every student who pos
sibly can should join one of the or
ganizitions for the benefit he woul 1
deiive from it.
