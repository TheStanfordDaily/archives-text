Kditor Daily I'at.o Ai/ro :
Several classrooms are used so con
stantly during the forenoons that jjreat
care must he taken to prevent tho at
mosphere becoming eiosc and unwhole
some. Air, unlike wines, does not im
prove with aire, and each class should
see before leaving a room that doors
and windows are opened. A little
thought I ulnes.i in this regard would
prevent many a headache and would be
a courtesy to all students, both ladies
and gunt It men. O. 11, 0.
