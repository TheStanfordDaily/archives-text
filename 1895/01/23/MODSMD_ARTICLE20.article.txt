# FOOTBALL CHANGES.
## Walter Camp Suggests Some New Rules. 
### 
Walter Camp, ihe inuu who litis year
led us to victory, has written lor the
New York Herald a long article in
which he ttates his views on the sub
ject of noeded changes in football rules.
After making incut ion of the unsatis
factory fair-catch rule, he discusses the
rule governing momentum plays, which
rends as follows;
â€¢No momentum mass plays shall he
allowtd. A momentum muss play is
one where more than three men start
he fore the hall is put in play. Nor
shall more than three men uroup for
that purpose more than five yards hack
of the point where the hall is put in
play."
The working of this rule during the
past season seems to indicate that it is
lacking in strength. Hut it is to be re
membered that Mr. Moffat, the chair
man of the rules committee, distinctly
stated in his report a 3 ear ago that he
did not expect the rule would entirely
do away with momentum plays, but it
would lead to a better rule. Mr. Camp
believes that since a return to the
simpler methods of interference is now
demanded, it will only be necessary to
enact that no man shall leave his po
sition until the ball is actually in play.
This seems to bo the only satisfactory
solution of the vexed question of mo
mentum plays, as it will, in a great
measure, do away with that collision cf
masses of men in rapid motion, which
bus been a great source of danger to
players during the last two seasons.
The phase of the game which has
caused the most unfavorable criticism
is the increasing amount, of slugging or
brutality. The press of the country
has rightly denounced it in the strong
est terms, and the faculties of some of
the smaller colleges have even gone so
far as to prohibit the game until slug
ging is legislated out of it. A year
ago when such an outcry was rawed
against football as plajed by American
colleges the rules committee spent
much time arid thought in an endeavor
to make rules so stringent that slugging
would not enter into the game. By
the addition of officials they hoped to
make the sport satisfactory iu this re
spect, but, as Mr. Camp says, "Their
intentions, though of the best, were not
sufficiently carried out, or were not
sufficiently explicit." Although the
new rule provided that the referee and
linesmen should assist the umpire in
watching for rough play, it did not
the officials the power to disqualify
men for slugging, Mr. Camp thinks
that an extension of the rule so as to
give this power to all the officials, in-'
stead of to the umpire alone, would
make it. satisfactory. Whether Mr.
Camp is right iu this matter remains to
be seen. The change is certainly a
yood one if the officials can be depended
upon to enforec it. Without conscien
tious officials the most stringent rules
against brutality will bo practically a
dead letter.
Mr. ('amp sums up his suggestions as
follows: ''If the game is to be made
satisfactory to the coach, spectator, par
ent, and faculty, the easiest and simplest
way of harmonizing all these elements
would be to place unlimited power in
the hands of all four officials regarding
roufrhnrss, to forbid any player starting
before the ball is actually put in play,
and to give the man making a fair
catch proper privilege as a result of the
fair catch.''
