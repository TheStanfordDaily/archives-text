# Delays in Registration.
## 
### 
So far this semester there have been
one hundred and fifty-eight students
who have registered late, nearly six
teen per cent of the total registration of
last semester. The reason, given in
each instance may be roughly classed
under five heads, as follows: Ist, de
layed trains; 2d, business or financial
reasons; 3d, personal illness, and illness
and death in family; 4th, social, inten
tional delay, neglect, etc.; sth, arrange
ment of work, difficulty in finding pro
fessors, etc.
The dates of registering and numbers
in each class are given in tbe following
table:
l»-t 2<l 3<l 4th sth Tot
January 8 9 8 :i 5 2 27
January 9 20 9 4 ]1 3 47
January 10 4 5 (i 5 — 20
January II 1 2 2 G 1 12

January 17 — 3 3 — — 0

But few of those in class Ist were de
layed nu>re than two days. Many of
those in class 2d have been here all tbe
time but have delayed registering until
prepared to pay the necessary fees. It
is to be regretted that over twenty five
per cent, of the total number registered
late had no good and sufficient reason
lor doing so.
