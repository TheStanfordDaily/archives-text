Tiie large number of s udents
dropped ftom the I"nivarsity for
poor work lust semester has effect
ively demonstrated that Stanford
is no pi,ico for idlers. Indeed, the
wail that has gone up fioni the
''Fifteen Hours Club,' iow aug
mented to astonishing numbers,
would indicate that the University is
t-> h< come the haven of grinds The
situation at present, with our
crowded cla-s rooms and luck of
chairs, makes it possible for tho fac
ulty to b<- indifferent in its own pe
etiliir way as to whether a student
leaves or remains at tho I'liiversitv.
Tho undoubted result of this will
be a higln-r standard of scholarship
at Stanford, and those who escape
tho facu ty's innovation may congrat
ulate the.nselves.
