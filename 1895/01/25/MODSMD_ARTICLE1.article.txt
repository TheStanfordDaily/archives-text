Below i* jLiiven a letter ftom Geo. C.
Carter, who was umpire at the Thanks
giving frame. It is in answer to a letter
Bent Mr. Carter by Manager Hicks,
enclosing Si clipping from the San Fran
cisco Chronicle, in which Captain
Benson of Berkeley is reported to have
made the statement that Carter had
acknowledged to him by letter that the
touchback given Berkeley was really a
touchdown, and that if lie had appealed
to the decision of the referee at, the
time ic would have been so decided.
This letter plainly shows that there was
no foundation lor such a statement, and
hereafter it will appear exceedingly
strange if the players across the bay
continue tr\ing to cover up defeat by
deluding the public with such ludicrous
reports.
Mr U.S. I licks, Stan I Iniv . Cal.
Dear Sir:—Yours of Dee. 4 li with
enclosed clipping from the Chiuiiui- ol
that date, is at hand.
It is indeed unfortunate that rumors
of this kind should he circulated by the
press, as it. needlessly raises discontent
and dissatisfaction. I here is, of course,
no foundation whatsoever for anv Mich
statement, and 1 have not a doubt, that
Cap'ain Hen son was probably as or
aut of any such rumor as myself up to
the time of its appearance.
If I remember correctly, in the
Chronicle's description of the game < n
N' v. oUtu, it sfa'ed that such eminent
autlioii y as Walter Camp disauieed
wi li the rulings upon this point, and I
have fiis au lioiity also to deny that
statement flitly, as, on our trip North.
Mr Camp ami L spoke of ilie harm
done to toutball by such misleading
statements. I know positively that
both Mr. Camp and Mr. (Jill cneiu
fully in the decision which gave Boik
cley only u touch back. Ail of you
who understand anything about foot,
ball will, I think, agree with the
couches of tin? teams that the proper in
terpretation was given of the rules, and
it is a question only of fact; as Mr.
Ilurd ami myself were in the best po
sition to see what occurred, there can
hardly be a qirstioti of any kind raised.
Any 112 outbid man also knows that
there is no appeal to the referee from
the umpire's deei-ion. Mr Ilurd gave
his decision that, tlie IJerkeley man was
on side when In; took the bill acros*
t e iine; ami 1 decided that it, was onlv
a touch-hick because lot failed to bold
the ball, which Was secured by a Stan
ford man.
It is useless to protract this discus
sion ilh'oul'li i lie press, as the public, as
a u-u il tiling, is entirely ignorant ot
the gaiiM'j loir, if any football mail has
any doubts upon tin? question I will
always be teady and uhnl to t xplain any
of the i ulings that, I have made.
Cto It. Cauteu.
