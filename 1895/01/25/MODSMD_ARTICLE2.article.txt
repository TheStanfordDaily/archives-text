Any undergraduate student, in the
I'nivcr»ity in.iy he a competitor in the

preliminary con'est, and from among
tlio t-p« »k« rs on that occasion throe

the final debute with Berkeley on
April 5.
Neither in the preliminary nor in
« lie iinal debate will it lie necessary for
the speakers to adopt either the nfiirtn
ative or negative side of tlio quesMou,
and there will be no team work, that is,
each debater will speak without any
reference to his colleagues or to those
who oppo*'* him, nor will lie be ex
pected to refute or substantiate argu
ments already made. Individual ex
celonce, ability, and grasp in pre
senting the subject will be the points
passed upon by the judges. The mer
its of the speakers and not the merits
ol the question will be decided.
The persons who are to speak in the
final contest on April f> will, on th e
day previous, draw lots to determine
utiiin which side o!' the question they
are to speak. Thus it will be seen
that put of the Staiif.nd men might be
t>n one side and part on the other, the
siime eondition also applying to the
Metkelev tepreseniatives. lint as each
mi in will have to depend entirely upon
his own speech, and will gain no belie
fs,from bis e die tliis arr ment

winning. Kaeh speaker will probably
be allotted fifteen minutes. The lead
ing of notes will be prohibited, and it
is not intended that the speeches shall
be committed to memory.
All persons desiring to enter the con
test ate r< quested to hand their names
to Dr. Ko.-s or Prof. Laihrop at once.
