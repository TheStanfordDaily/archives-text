# THE
						COIF CLUB.
## 
### 
A New Society Formed by Law Students.
The new law club, which has adopted
the name of the Coif Club, had its first
meeting on Friday evening. As at)
organization it resembles the Bench and
Bar Law Club, being like it limited to
nine members, and formed to p ead
cases involving some of the perplexing
problems of law which are constantly
confronting lawyers in actual practice.
At each meeting a case will be argued
by four members, two for the plain tiff
and two for the defendant, the other
members acting as judges. The name
originated in the organization effected
by the sergeants-at-law in early London.
They wore coifs as a mark of di tinc
tiou, and were noted for their legal
acumen.
In the case pleaded on Friday even
ing the plaintiff was represented by
Messrs. Clayton, '05, and Huff, '96;
the defer dant by G. B. V\ ilson, '96
