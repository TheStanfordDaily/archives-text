A visitjr to the University must
be struck by the appearance of sev
eral signs which decorate the arbor
etum. A madrone bush, fiom
which the berries have fallen weeks
a<>o, bears this inscription: "Stu
dents xnust not pick these berries."
Flower bods without a suspicion
of bud or blossom are labelled
" Students are requested not to pick
these flowers," etc., etc. There may
be students who cannot be trusted
to spare the University property, but
this fact need not be advertised to
the public.
