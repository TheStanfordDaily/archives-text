The attention of students is called
to the fact that certain persons,
mostly outsiders, are shooting small
game iu the arboretum and near the
lake. It is the duty of every stu
dent to do all in his power to pre
vent such misdemeanors. The
founders of the University intended
that the estate should be a place of
refuge for game of all sorts. All
students owe it to their own best
interests to report all slaughter of
game.
