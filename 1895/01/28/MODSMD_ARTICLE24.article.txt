Most of the athletes in the Uni-!
versity have shown by the enthusi- j
asm of Saturday'B meeting that they
intend to give the University the
benelit of their services this year if
they, in turn, rre accorded proper
encouragement. That encourage
ment is the raising of a fund neces
sary to the securing of a coach who
is competent to make tbe men work
and at the same time bring them to
a degree of proficiency which will
count many points for Stanford when '
they enlist in the many field-days to
be held in San Francisco this spring.
The amount required is not large, |
but the success or failure in secur
ing it may decide Stanford's pres
tige for tbe season. By a unani- j
mous vote at the meeting held Satur
day morning, the athletes declared i
themselves in favor of a coach, even
if he had to be secured at the f=acii-1
fice of medals. This commendable
spirit on the part of the contestant*
should receive the heavy financial
support from the student body!
which it deserves.
