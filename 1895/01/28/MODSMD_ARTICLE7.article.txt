# Dr. Haweis' Lecture.
## 
### 
The announcement that Dr. Ilaweis,
the celebrated English clergyman, was
to lecture Friday evening, drew out the
largest crowd of the season. When
the quaint old gentleman appeared on
the platform, the chapel was crowded
to the doors. The audicnce was not
slow in appreciating the many witti
cisms with which his introductory re*
marks abounded. The lecture itself,
"iMusic, the Art of the Age," was per
haps the most unique performance ever
given here. Although essentially a
lecture, the speaker entertained in
eueh a pleasing manner and at such op
portune moments, that his hearers were
unconscions of the two hours consumed
by Pr. Haweis. This is probably the
last time that he will appear at the
University, and his talks will live long
in the memories of those who have
availed themselves of the opportunity
to listen to him.
