### 
The sermon Sunday was delivered by
Mrs. Sarah U. Cooper of San Francisco.
The subject of the discourse was "Prac
tical Christianity," based on the parable
of the talents — Matt, xxv." The
subject-matter was as follows:
I believe in a practical Christianity,
t believe in a religion that takes hold of
daily life in all its daily aspects and
daily needs. A religion that has all
fora future world and nothing for this,
has nothing for either. True Christi
anity cannot be defined or compressed
into a creed. God in the soul is Chris
tianity. lie who would teach that
God is a father must prove himself a
brother. Christianity is the science of
right living. It cannot be learned
from books. It is the living epistle
that is read by all men The Bible
is a light to our path, but we must do
our walking. Christianity as a theory
of life is not enough; it should be a vi
tal force underlying all action. What
we need today is a more practical de
monstration. It is Christ within cry
ing out against the evil in ourselves
and in the world about us. There is
just as much true gospel as there is of
this power within us.
For the last nine hundred years doc
trine has not been neglected; but
man has. It is society in all its wants
and woes that has been neglected, until
the wail goes up, "Who can show us
any good? " "What is to be done?" I
would, if I could, have a chair of So
ciology in every theological seminary.
I would have the theological student
spend less time on pulpit preparation
and more on man in the streets of secu
lar life. A religious teacher should be
in touch with human life. Practical
aims, if not uuited with religion, de
prive society of its life. Years of theo
logical study must be accompanied by
wise dealing with the poor, infirm, and
aged. Otherwise there will come the
disinclination and finally the inability to
labor. There is no such thing as a self
centered religion; for aelfishnsss is the
origiu of all sin. True religion is not
Eelf-centered but diffusive. We need
a religion that by its works will lift up
society and stimulate the common people
of our land. Love to God and love to
man will bring out this practical Christ
ianity.
A practical Christianity means so
much. It embraces the whole of hu
manity. It does not say, "Send the
multitude away." The church should
hold the key for what is honest and
best in human experience. "Where are
the aged and infirm? Where arc the
children? Have we sent them away?
If so, have we the true religion? Over
every church door should be written,
"Ye need not depart." I am glad God
does not despise the poor and weak. It
is man who does that.
There should be less argument and
more love. Coldness is the greatest
enemy to religion. The enthusiastic
unbeliever is better than the cold dead
theologian. A loving, living Christ

ianity is always working, always achiev
ing. Its foundation is in eternity but
it exists in the open fields; around it,
as a moving force, are thousands of de
pendencies which work with it. Ilence
every religious teacher should study
political and social problems and know
the conditions which make such de
pendencies a necessity. lie should be
a clear thinker He should be inter
ested in everything which coucerns the
welfare of mankind. We may condemn
socialism, yet there should be more uu
ion between the people. It will be a
sorry day for our nation when Christian
citizenship takes no part in municipal
affairs. A Christian man is not an
imbecile in any line. St. Paul, who
was second to none as a teacher ot
religious knowledge, had tact, foresight,
and common sense. lie is the true
man who shows himself to be true at a
point where all others fail.
God can bless our gifts however
small. He is rich who lays out and
not he who lays up; for we only keep
what we give. He who does most with
what he has is the faithful servant. All
we have to answer for is—trying
Christ will not tolerate slothfuluess,
Kvery day the power we do not use is
lost. Fidelity to little things is the
best for the future world. Men applaud
great deeds; but God applauds great,
love and will not forget the secret fidel
ities. All the riches of the temples
of old are forgotten. We only know
of one poor woman. lier offering of
two mites has made the world richer
than all the riches of that treasury.
In proportion as God has made us
strong, we must impart to our lellows;
we must bear with the infirmities of the
weak; we must kindle hope in the
wretched. Sorrow should pass into
sympathy, embracing all that is purest
and best, for love is the great force <112
the Christian man.
