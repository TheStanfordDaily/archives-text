The and others who
deliver the Tuesday evening lectures
seem to have developed a fad of
couching the titles of their lectures
in terms that are enigmatic. Such
a practice has the advantage of ex
c.ting a great deal of curiosity and
eliciting many guesses as to what
the subject matter will be. Then
there is a chance fora pleasant sur
prise—as when the lecture that from
its title might have dealt with some
new freak in the museum proves to
be on early dramatic art.
But, after all, this custom is
one that, arouses general dissatisfac
tion. Many a student does not care
to gamble on the chances of such a
lecture's interest to him and does
not attend. This fact should bring
about a reform in a fault so glaring
that a student in English 8 guilty of
such mistakes would be unceremoni
ously flunked.
