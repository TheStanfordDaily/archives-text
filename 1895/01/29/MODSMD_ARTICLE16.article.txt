Notice lias been posted in Encina
at Mrs. Stanford's txpre&sed desire,
that students not boarding in the
hall can engage rooms at the same
rate and be accorded the same priv
ileges as boarders. This rule will
give much satisfaction to all, as there
are many students who are auxious
to obtaiu rooms at Encina but pre
fer to boatd elsewhere, and tome of
i he present occupants detire a change
of diet once in a while. A change
similar to this with the exception
that a higher room rent was charged
10 non-boarders, was instituted last
semester by parties not so author
ized. ]>ut why should one be
charged a higher room rent because
t e prefers to board outside of En
cina when the two departments are

entirely separate? It is pleasing to
note that the injustice of the former
rule was seen and that such a highly
satisfactory one has been substituted.
It shows that even the trifles which
affect the students' interests are all
observed by the thoughtful spirit of
one of the living founders of this
institution.
