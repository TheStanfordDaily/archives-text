As the time for the first examina
tions of the semester draws near, it
may bo allowable to make a sugges- j
tion in regard to them. Examina
tions have at all times a mysterious
terror for the student, and are, quite I
naturally, a source of worry and !
strain to them. Many members
of the faculty have frequently ex
pressed a desire that examinations
could be done away with entirely at
this University as has been done of
late at Cornell and other large east
ern institutions. Even certain Berk- j
eley professors have advocated the
plan of exempting students from!
final examinations and giving only .
such tests and quizzes throughout
the semester as the opinion of the
professor may deem best.
It is to be admitted that several
Stanford professors do not give fi-;
nals, but simply require the last
written test of the semester to be
over such ground as has been cov-!
ered since the previous written in
quisition; yet, when such writ-j
ten txercises are demanded in the
last week of the term along with
other finals they partake of the gen
eral toue.
It'such severe culminating tests can
not, in the wisdom of the professors,
be deleted from the student's course
here, is it not possible for the fac
ulty members so to arrange their
examinations that all finals will not
fall due on the last days of the col
lege yen? How can students be
expected to do justice to themselves
and satisfy their tutors when, ex
hausted by nearly twenty weeks of
constant work and study, they are
required to take possibly twelve or
fifteen last tests to show what they
know, and take them all within the
closing five days of the term? It is
safe to say that the last days of the
college semester are made unneces
sary severe and wearing Surely
the faculty membeis who can easily
do so, will so arrange their work this
semester that no such complaint
can again be made.
