# Prof. Comstock's Lecture.

### 
The chapel was only partially filled
last night to hear the lecture on the
"Habits of Spiders," by Prof. J. H.
Comstock, but those who were present
were rewarded by a most interesting
and instructive lecture delivered in
Prof. Oomstock's peculiarly happy vein.
From the very nature of the lecture—
one containing a vast number of simple,
interesting facts bound together in a
harmonious whole —any abstract of it
is very unsatisfactory.
The lecturer began by a short ex
planation of the structure of spiders,
and then took up their habits. Fre
quent use was made of the blackboard
in illustration of the forms of webs, etc.
The following is an abstract contain
ing a few of the many facts mentioned:
The world is filled with myriad forms
of life each battling for its existence
It, is interesting to see the habits which
d ffcrent animals form in order to pre
set ve their lives. The study of insects
i,i in'eresting to students for its own
sake.
The body of a spider is divided into
two parts, the thorax and the abdomen.
There are four legs on each side, each
leg having at the end a pair of claws
and underneath a cushion. At the end
of the claw is a hole from which a duct
leads to a poison glaud. The opening
of the duct is on the back side of the
claw to prevent the flesh of the victim
from closing it when the spider bites.
At the hinder end of the body are
the spinnerets or silk-spinning organs.
These are usu illy six in number, each
of which is made up of the opening of
many little ducts leading from the silk
secreting glands within. Out of these
ducts the silk is forced, th-»se thousands
of fine stiands cohering into a single
thread. The silk changes from a fluid
to a solid materia! as it comes out.
It is the habit of spiders to prey on
each other. Their webs are regular and
irregular. The regular webs are those
made by the common house spiders.
The cob-web spiders spin a thread with
out any regularity. Guy lines are
stretched above the webs to knock vic
tims down on the webs, where they can
be easily killed.
The funnel webs are made in the
grass. The funnel is occupied by the
spider, and the hole at the bottom is
open to allow the spider to escape when
foes pursue him.
When webs are built in corners the
spider walks around and carries the i
first thread. When a web is to be
woven between separate objects, the
spider allows the wind to carry the first
thread to the adjacent object. This I
thread drawn taut serves as a bridge ;
The framework of webs is made of j
inelastic thread, but the intermediate!
threads are elastic and thus tend to en
tangle the victim. A spiral is woven
in the middle of the elastic thread and |
this allows the victim to be twisted up 1
and caught in other threads.
A spider called the triangle spider!
makes its webs on the dead branches of

evergreens. It makes triangle webs
having only four radii, never more or
less.
Silk is used for other purposes than
making snares. Spiders drop by
it from place to place. The aero
nautic spiders spin long webs which
float through the air carrying them
along. These spiders sometimes float
thus for hundreds of miles, as is shown
by their presence in mid-ocean. The
spiders use silk in the construction of
their egg sacks. The mining spiders
live in nests which consist simply of
little holes dug in the ground and lined
with silk. The tarantula is an example
of this group.
The trap-door spiders make silk lined
nests having trap-doors with bevelled
edges. Little is kuown of their habits,
as most of the species are nocturnal.
One kind pops out after its prey; an
other kiud makes a web at, night and
waits for beetles, and retires into its
nest during the day.
No creatures are abhorred much
more than spiders. Only a few, however,
are poisonous, and most varieties can be
handled and examined without trouble.
