Some very urgent reasons ought
to be brought to the notice of the
Athletic Board before they decide
to deny the petition of the track ath
letes fora seventy-five dollar appro
priation towards hiring a trainer. On
the principle of the greatest good
for the greatest number, track ath
letics should, perhaps, occupy a
higher place than any other branch
of college sport. It cannot be too
strongly insisted that it oilers to the
average man, who is really of the
first importance, all the advantages
of physical training and develop
ment that football affords, entails
not nearly as much bodily risk, and
places no premium on unusual size
and weight. The presence of a
trainer who knows his business will
not only serve to increase the num
ber of men who will come out, but
will go far towards putting into our
hands the twenty-five or thirty points
which we need to stand on a par
with Berkeley. The Athletic Board
will make a serious mistake if it does
not grant the desired appropriation.
