One of the most enjoyable features
of college life is being sadly neg
lected by Stanford students. At
most large universities, college songs
are a recognized part of college
pleasures. In English universities
as well as in those of this country,
college tongs have a strong hold in
the minds of the students. Here,
however, many of the scholars do
not know the most common of the
many old time melodies so popular
among collegians.
This is not so at Berkeley, and the
fict caused considerable comment at
a college reception which occurred
in one of the large cities of this
state during the holidays. Both
Stanford aud Berkeley students were
in attendance and in the college
songs which were sung Berkeley
carried off the honorß. This is not
as it should be, and might be
changed for the better were some of
the good old college tunes substi
tuted fora part of the dance music
discoursed so many evenings during
the week at Eucina. We shouldn't
expect to make a good showing with
our songs at a football game when
we neglect the words and the music
so persistently throughout the col
lege year.
