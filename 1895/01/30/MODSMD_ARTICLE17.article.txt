The Harvard Deutscher Verein will
suou present a Germau play based on
student life in Germany, and contain
ing many student songs.
There is a lively breeze over inter
collegiate athletics at Cornell. Prof.
Wilder of that university has begun a
crusade against iutercollegiate contests,
and the students arc up in arms,
Yale students are indignant at the
treatment they received at the hands of
New Haven patrolmen duriug the prog
ress of a large fire in that city a few
nights ago. Several claim that they
were handled with unnecessary rough
ness, and one shows a badly battered
bead which he alleges was received at
the hands of a policeman. The crush
at the fire was very great, and the
police maintain that the Yale athletes
started crowding just for fun.
