# First Baseball Practice.
## 
### 
The first regular baseball practice of
| the season was held on the old field
yesterday afternoon. Some promising
material appeared, and despite the fact
that only five of the old players were
out, the prospects fora good team are
not as bad as was at first supposed.
The fact, however, that we have lost
the entire battery of last jear cannot be
overlooked in considering our prospects.
The nine is thus weak in those positions
where excellence counts for most. Al
though no candidates for pitehers and
catchers have yet appeared, it is hoped
that the spirit of loyalty which lives in
every Stanford athlete, and which has
mauy a time before this come to the
front in an emergency, will induce a
number of men to do their best towards
filling these positions.
The following is a list of the players
and tho positions they held : Sheehan,
3rd base; Calhoun, 2nd; J. Thompson,
Ist; C.Ray, 3rd; N.Johnson, field;
Hush, field ; Wight, field ; Shirley
Baker, field. The playing was under
the supervision of Pyer, captain for the
ensuing year.
