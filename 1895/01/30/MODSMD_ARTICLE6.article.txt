Kditor Daily Palo Alto:
In reply to many questions which
have been asked about track athletics,
I wish to say a few words in regard to
what has been done and what it is
planned to du iu this branch of athletics
this year.
After over three years of waiting the
track has at last become an assured re
ality. liut for the rain the quarter
mile oval would have been finished on
the 10th of January according to con
tract. If good weather continues we
may expect its completion by the 10th
of February.
The track will cost in all about $600.
This is a rough estimate necessarily, as
much remains to be done after the cin
ders are on. The money was raised in
the following manner: With ])r. Jor
dan's conseut aud recommendation I
called personally upon all the trustees
within a radius of fifty miles and asked
their aid in the enterprise, with the
following result: Mr. Charles Goodall
subscribed $100; Mr. Leon Sloss $50;
Mr. Horace Davis $10; Mr. J. D.
Grant $.'JO; Dr. E. tt. Taylor $10.
The rest 1 have written to but have re
ceived no replies as yet.
I then called on the merchants ot
Palo Alto with the following result:
Mr. A. C. Pillsbury subscribed $5 00,
B. F. Hall 85.00, G. C.Thaxter $5.00,
J. C. Black $5.00, H. Daley $5.00,
Bank of Palo Alto 82.50, T. N. Sher
man $2.50, A. Schubert $1.00. Dr.
Jordaj>ls lecture, "The Accent of the
Matterhorn," brought in $74.25, mak
ing in all $305.24 from outside sources.
The Athletic Committee gave $800 to
the track. Total assets, $G05.25. The
rock used in the track is taken from
the quarry back of the stock farm. It
will probably be a gift from Mrs. Stan,
ford, although the agreement made
with Mr, Lathrop in Mrs. Stanford's
absence was to pay 70c a cubic yard tor
it. Mrs. Stanford has given us the
use of the broad-tired wagons to haul
the rock. Without these the work
would have been suspended until the
roads got hard. Part of the cinders
were given by the Southern Pacific.
This gift was secured through Mr.
Eaton. Part were obtained last year
and were on the ground. I have just
learned that five more car-loads have

been ordered without my knowledge or
consent. These are unnecessary, but as
the parties ordering them did so with
good intentions, they will be paid for
if they are used. So much for what
has been done.
Capt. Brown plans to have three field
days this spring, and to give new men
all the encouragement possible. This
last, as was so ably presented in a late
editorial, I consider of great importance,
for our chief work this year must be to
develop new material.
There has been some talk of hiring a
coach. In fact, I understand that at
the meeting on Saturday, it was voted
to have one. lam confident the finan
cial condition of the track fund was not
known, or no such action would have
been taken. Of course it would be a
splendid thing to have a coach; but un
less additional funds can be raised ii
will be impossible. A subscription is
being circulated for this purpose now.
The experience of the football man
agement in regard to the sweaters of
fered for the champion class team, has
shown that a prize will arouse more en
thusiasm in a sport than any other in
fluence that can be brought to bear.
For this reason I shall make a special
effort to save money enough to offer
some medals that will be worth the
competing.
Hammersmith & Field have promised
a handsome cup as a special prize in
some event to be niuied later, probably
one of the sprints. It will probably be
a condition that the cup shall be held
for three years before becoming the
property of the holder. Fuller par
ticulars will be published later
A relay team will be sent up to the
Olympic Club fiefd-day on Feb 22.
An effort will be made to have Stanford
represented in every open field-day in
the vicinity this spring.
