The dogs owned by the Zoological
department and quartered in kennels
near the camp Lave become au un
mitigated nuisance. For the last
few nights their howling has made
sL ep almost impossible in that part
<>t tlie campus. If this department
must maintain a dog-pound they
might at least remove it from the
le-idence district.
The comiug of good weather is
accompanied by the usual influx of
tourists. But theieby hangs a tale.
In consequence of the many visitors
the livery patronage Ihs attained
gigantic proportions, but it cannot
be compared with the buaiutss of
Judge AVigle's couit. Three dis
horned countenances and as many
wieclted vehicles are tlie result of ef
forts to get "even" on the part of
disappointed drivers â€” raised and
fostered uuder the eaves of this
home of culture.
