The Class of '95 inaugurated the
junior promenade last year and made
it an occasion long to be remem
bered. '97 now comes forward and
proposes to 112 ollow '95's example by
giving a sophomore cotillion on
February 22. We wish the class all
success. There is very little society
iu the University, though our facil
ities for such, on account of our co
education, are unexceptional. This
movement on the part of '97 should,
theiefore, receive the hearty support
of the whole University.
