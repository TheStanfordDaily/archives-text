The changes recommended by Dr.
Augell to the Athletic Board—(1)
providing fo t - an assistant football
manager; (2) debarring any student
delinquent in his college work from
playing on auy of the teams in inter
collegiate contests until the delin
quency be removed; and (3) provid
ing for, letting out all contracts for
athletic goods to the lowest bidder
—ought to meet with the approval
of the iu»jority of the student body.
The lust season has made it clrar
that the amount of woik which falls
upon the shoulders of the football
manager is too much to ask one man
to do. Placing the burden upon
two men would lighten up the work,
and divide the responsibility for
whatever is done. £uch an arrange
tut nt ought to be far inoro satisfac-

Tory than our present plan. The
second recommendation ia the one
that will doubtless cause the most
argument, and if passed, it would
probably prevent some from partici
pating in the intercollegiate contests.
But athletic interests should be
made subservient to University work.
As much as we desire Stanford to
take a high place in athletics, we
must desire more that the high char
acter of the University be rnaiu
tained. The third recommendation
strikes at an evil which has become
more prominent each year: the in
discriminate letting of contracts.
Some of the dealers in athletic goods
who have advertised in the Univer
sity papers have felt themselves
slighted because they have received
no patronage from the student body.
Others have received more than
their share. The recommendation
aims to make it so that all will have
an equal chance. Of course there
are certain arguments that can be
raised agcinst the recommendations,
but if the best interests of the Uni
versity are followed the recommend
ations will be adopted.
