# Debate at Yale.

An editorial in the last Yale Alumni
lleeklt/'F ays:
Tlie monotony ot defeat in Yale's
forensic contests with her great rival is
even less pleasant to her friends than
is the monotony of athletic debute to
the friends of Harvard. Yale men may
not talk so much on this subject as do
the disappointed and defeated men of
Cambridge when some brand new sys
tem ot invincible football has run up
against the genuine old-time article
manufactured at New Haven. Hut
that shows, if it shows anything, that
the defeats and what they indicate, are
held to be too serious a matter to Yale
to have her friends talking very loud
about it.
Ihe result ol the series of intercol
legiate debates shows that in a very im
portant respect the training of Yale for
the life duties that devolve upon the
educated man, is deficient. Men who
have been here in recent years feel it in
their own cases. They are pained to
see from the showing ot the undergrad
uates in these public meetings, which
are the only ones outside of athletics
bringing together the students of the
two universities, that things are not
geiring better here.
T<Â»o much credit cannot be given
to those who have kept debate alive at
Vale during these lutter years of indif
ference. They have worked well. The
defeats at the hands of Harvard, and
the most unfortunate impression which
those defeats have left in the public
mind, are not to he laid at their doors.
A larye part of the undergraduate
world, including most of the men of
brains and influence, are not interested
in debate. They do not see its import
ance. It is not an established insti
tution. It is rather made fun of.
Those who do work at it are looked
upon as harmless, perhaps, but few
care about what they do, until an inter
collegiate debate comes along, and when
this is over, they are advised to <;o out
of the business. Under these con
ditions those who keep up the debating
institutions and furnish material to
make even an interesting game for Har
vard, are to be highly commended.
