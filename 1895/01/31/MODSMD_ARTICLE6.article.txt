# Clark University.

Mr. Yoder, uow principal of the
San Fraucisco Normal School, addressed
the class iu Child Studies yesterday
afternoon on the methods and instruc
tion in Clark University, Like Stan
ford, this university was founded by a
wealthy Californian. It is situated at
Worcester, about as far from Boston as
Stanford is from San Francisco. Hut
iustead of a thousand students, Clark
has but forty-two—faculty and students
all told. It is a university for post
graduates alone. It has five depart
ments: mathematics, physics, chem
istry, biology, and psychology. The
department of psychology is probably
the strongest, being under the direct
supervision of Dr. G. Stanley Hull.
The work is entirely individual, and no
recitations. Professors are met only
when questions are to be asked. The
great virtue of the Clark University is
its activity. Students are too often
passive. They do not do for them
selves; but at Clark one ends his passive
education aud takes up an aggressive
attitude toward the unknown. He
takes up a special line of work and
studies all the literature on the subject.
He gets to the very frontier of his
work. Then he pushes out boldly for
himself, keeping well posted on what is
being done in his Hue elsewhere. All
original work of any value appears
either in the Pedagogical Seminary
or the Psychological Review, both ot
which are published by the university.
A student may devote his whole three
years to one piece of work, or he may
complete two or three special studies
before he takes his doctor's degree.
Mr. Yoder, who entered as a graduate
of Indiana University, has many inter
esting facts to tell about the students
and the original men who compose the
faculty. Dr. Hall is a very enthusias
tic man, and the student who consults
him about his paper always leaves him
with the feeling that his is the most
important piece ot work being doue in
the university. Then he goes to work
immediately, but the work soon begins
to lag. He goes to Dr. Hall again.
He finds him just as enthusiastic as
before, but upon an entirely different
point. When the student is com
pletely " ruftled up," he turns to Dr.
13umham, probably the best-read man
in pedagogy in the United States. He
is always calm, helpful, and encourag
ing. No less interesting are Dr. Hall
and block-headed Dr. Chamberlin who
is absolutely soaked in myth. Dr.
Sinford is kind, pleasant, and earnest —
an indefatigable worker. All the pro
fessors stimulate the student by their
own hard work. Indeed, the studeut
often finds himself overworked before
he is aware.
In and about Worcester, this univer
sity is known as the College of Cranks.
The people of Worcester term the stu
dents "jiggers," and so bitterly do they
hate them that on occasion their lives
have been threatened. Among the stu
dents are found long-haired "freaks" in

mathematics, pedagogical geniuses who
guard their doors by police least their
points escape, and students so psycho
logical that they live all over Worcester
without paying a cent of board. But,
with all this there is not to be seen a
single woman's face. Dr. Hall says
some women are good, and some are
bad; if he lets in one he must let in all;
so he will have none. However, his
summer schools are open to them,
which gives promise for the university
to do likewise.
The university has one lecture hall,
a very plain, large room. Long tables
form three sides to a quadrangle in this
room. At the fouth side is the desk of
the instructor. The students have sep
arate rooms for tlieir own work. There
is a room in the town library set apart
for the students, in which they may
have as many as three hundred volumes
at once, "to tumble,'' as Dr. Hall says
Connected with the university is the
Pedagogical Museum, in which are to
be found all the best sorts of devices
for illustrative methods. The profes
sors often go abroad, and as a great part
of the work of the students is made up
of visiting other institutions of learn
ing, both have ample opportunity to
collect material fora museum of this
kind.
