# DOWN TO CASES.
## A
						Stanford Man Will Coach the Berkeley Baseball Team. 
### 
Berkeley has at last fully realized
her heretofore utter helplessness in
baseball, and now that only a remnant
of Stanford's star team has returned to
college , has worked up an enthusiasm
that knows no bounds. Myriads of
candidates appear on the diamond each
night, frisky as colts iu a pasture. In
fact their levity is beyond description
at the thought of a victory against Stan
ford on the festive green.
One man is serious, however. He
is Manager Sinsheimer. Ere he was
aware, flattering reports of a priceless
treasure, eager to coach his infantile
sand lot aggregation (no hirelings this
year ), tempted him to secure his
services without mature deliberation.
The San Francisco dailies herald the
arrival of their eastern star, when, alas
â€” Mr. Sinsheimer discovers that his
great And is an ex-Stanford student.
W. H. Irwin, ex-'96, has been en
gaged to coach Berkeley's baseball team.
Irwin began his baseball career in '88
when he played ou the famous Vermont
Academy team which was captained by
".Jack" Highlands, Harvard's great
twirier. At first Irwin played third
but later lie caught Highlands,
who was even at that time a'-phenom."
He caught the three remaining years of
his academic course and captained the
team during his senior year. During
the seasou of' 93 he stood behind the
plate for the pitcher of the Brooklyn
Athletic team, who is to fill the box for
Brown University this year. Freely,
of the New Kt gland league, Stewart,
<M|itain of the University of Vermont
team, and Brown of the Boston Blues,
have at different times coached him and
lie has also had some experience as a
coach in preparatory schools himself.
His ability as a player at Man ford has
never been veiy fully demonstrated.
Toward the end of last semester he
placed right field on the '96 class team.
