# SAN FRANCISCO KINDERGARTENS.
## Results of the Work of Mrs. Stanford and Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper. 
### 
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, whose sermon
was so much enjoyed last Sunday, is at
the head of the kindergartens of Pan
Francisco. In addition to supervising
the many kindergartens of that city,
she conducts a training school for teach
ers, and supplies kindergartens through
out the West. The scope and value of
her work can scarcely be estimated.
The annual enrollment is nearly 4000
children under five years of age. The
total receipts are £40,000 per annum.
San Francisco kindergartens have ex
isted fifteeu years, during which time
over 18,000 children have been trained
and sent into the school-world. About
10,000 Keports ot the Golden Gate
work were scattered at the World's
Fair, as a direct result of which kinder
gartens have been established in Can
ada, Bombay, New Zealand, Hawaii,
Japan, Australia, and South America.
Nine thousand "graduates" of these
little schools have been carefully
brought up, and only one child, a
feeble-minded boy, was found to have
been under arrest.
The Leland Stanford Junior Kinder
garten is the first memorial one in the
world. Mrs. Stanford gave §5,000,
and this gift inspired other bereaved
parents, so that now there are memorial
kinderg-irtens all over the world. Mrs.
Stanford has given §180,000 to the
kindergartens of San Francisco.
The working committees and also the
press of that city have acted most gen
erously in such matters.
It is becoming a recognized fact in
educational circles that careful training
and refining influences for the very
young are invaluable, fhe most beau
tiful home life lacks something, espec
ially in the case of only children. The
social element as well as the industrial
is fostered, and the character of chil
dren used to the genial advantages of
kindergarten life is perceptibly better
than that of children used to the in
fluences of home alone.
