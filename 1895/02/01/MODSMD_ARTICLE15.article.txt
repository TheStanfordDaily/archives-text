Mk. Kennan's lecture here next
Thursday evening on "Vagabond. Life
in Russia" is one of his finest. The
stereopticon illustrations are very
beautiful, and the song which he
sings in soft melodious Russian
draws his audience with him to a
r ver scene in the land of snow where
a fisherman siugs his native tunes.
Mr. Ivennan's lecture is an unusual
attraction for Stanford, and it i«
hoped that the chapel will be filled
by an appreciative audience.
