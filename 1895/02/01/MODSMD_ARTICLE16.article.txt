It is against the rules of the men's
gymnasium to appear on the floor
with heeled shoes. This rule is not
only often broken but students even
come iu on the floor after classes
with their shoes covered with mud.
It is bad enough to find the ladders
and hars scratched and cut up, but
when the mats and various pieces of
apparatus are smeared with mud, the
enjoyment of physical culture ceases.
The spirit of utter disregard for
other people's comfort seems char
acteiistic of a certain class of college
students.
