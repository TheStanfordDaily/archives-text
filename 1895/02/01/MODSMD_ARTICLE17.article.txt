One of the few disadvantages of
our elective system, by which class
distinctions are so little recognized,
is a lack of loyalty and enthusiasm.
Unless the units of a class hold to
gether firmly and cooperate heartily,
little creditable work, social, literary,
or athletic, will result. The sopho
more, junior, and senior hops, the
junior farce and class day furnish
excellent opportunities for the vast
silent majority to donate services and
enthusiasm for their class honor
Hut, a few make the speeches, lead
the dance, and write the play, yet
these few are inexpressibly aided or
deforred by the warm or chilling
spirit which pervades their class.
