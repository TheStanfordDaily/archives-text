A great deal ot embarrassment is
c xperienced by girls who are obligtd
to come late into a crowded class
room, and are left to drag in a heavy
clnir in addition to the books,
wraps, and other paraphernalia
with which they are burdened. The
gentlemen who neglect courtesies in
s'lch times, frequjntly excuse the
omission by citing instances of in
gratitude, and other lack of appreci
ation on the part of the girl for
whom they have sicritiecd a seat-

It is certainly discouraging under;
these circumstances to receive
neither expressed thanks or the
slightest token of recognition. Such
slight matters are due to careless
ness, and need only a word of sug
gestion to eradicate them.
