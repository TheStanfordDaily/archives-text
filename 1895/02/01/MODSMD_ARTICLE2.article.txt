# Archery Club Formed.

### 
I'rof. Abbott, who is an expert
archer, kindly a very profitable
talk on aichery Wednesday afternoon
to the young ladies interested After
explaining a number of the practical
and technical points connected with
archery—the use of the bow and other
details —he said: "There is a popular
idea in America among men that arch
ery is effeminate, does not furnish ex
ercise, and is uninteresting. Nothing
is more absurd than these suppositions.
The sustained use of the bow provides
more exerei.-e than tennis and nearly
as much as football. It is the most
beautiful and graceful sport possible for
a loly, and is a fascinating sport fora
man."
I'rof Abbott suggested competition,
and contests fora cup, to awaken en
thusiasm, and liter, matches with other
clubs. He complimented Stanford
girls for initiating so fascinating a pas

time, one which is sure to come into
prominence in American society. As
a last appeal to interest, he suggested
that young men either be admitted to
work with the girls, or incited to work
against them in tournaments.
After Prof. Abbott's talk the young
ladies met and decided to lorm us flex
ible an organization as possible, bound
by very little red tape. Two officers
were elected: Miss Winnifred Harper,
president; and Miss Alma Patterson,
manager.
