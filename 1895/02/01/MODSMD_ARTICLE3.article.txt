# The 						Work Has Begun.
## 
### 
Work was begun on the new baseball
ground today. The drainage system
will first be put in. It will consist of
three drains, one running through
each of the three bases to the home
base, where they will empty into one
larger drain, running off under the
back stop The ground will then be
graded to a level, and a layer of cinders
put on and rolled. '1 here is plenty of
room to erect a grandstand on either
side of the diamond, and the new
grouud willjnot lack this advantage, as
some have believed it would.
