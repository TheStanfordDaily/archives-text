# Yesterday's Sermon.
## 
### 
The congregation Sunday was ad
dressed by llev. J. K. McLean of the
Pacific Theological Seminary. The
general subject of his sermon was "Bread
of Life", taken i'roin St. John, vi., 35:
but the whole chapter is necessary for
the understanding of it.
After the miracle of the loaves and
fishes, Christ was followed to Caperneum
by all the fleshly hearers ot his word.
Knowing why they came, he reproved
them by pointing out to them that they
should not labor for meat which perished,
but for the true bread of heaven. Con
sidering Christ as a man and as a
teacher, this chapter furnishes u good
example of what we might call hi* man
ner of thinking Instead of seeing one
aspect of a question, he was accustomed
on many occasions, by a few sentences,
to draw conclusions that would include
all aspects and every manner of appli
cation. So in this instance he starts
in with the vulgar matter —bodily hun
ger, bringing the minds of the milti
tilde then face to face with the greater
question of human want and longing
Christ wis, therefore, often misunder
stood fhe mass of the people could
not go so easily from a single aspect to
a comprehensive one His speeches
were not only perp!ixins: to the multi
tude, but sometimes even his own dis
ciples whispered with blank faces,
••This is a hard saying; who can hear
it?"
He furnished a key to his conversa
tion, however," when lie said, ''The
flesh profireth nothing. It is the spirit
that quickeneth." It is in the spirit
that there is life. "The words that 1
speak unto you, they are spirit and
they are life." He went from that
lowest form of hunger to the universal
hunger. That man by no means has
his hunger appeased who has his body
filled with bread. His main hunger is
yet unsatisfied. The physical man is
only the shell under which the real
man lives. This shell furnishes him
with a few appliances through whose
agency he can perform work; but it is
not the man. The b< dy needs to be
built up and renewed continually. If
it deteriorates sufficiently, the man
comes to naught or migrates. The
wants of the body must not be neg
lected. Hut the bread which we
chiefly call bread or the life which we
chifly call life ary not real bread or real
life at all.
There are five forms of hunger, all
equally imperative. The lowest form
appeals to the senses. The child comes
into the world as a bit of hunger
wrapped in a wisp of flesh. It has no
power of recognition, but it knows
what hunger is and for days it is noth
ing but the increment of hunger. It
is the incarnation of hunger. Hut the
half-grown boy is the carnation of
hunger. He sits down to the table
hungry and he leaves the table hungry.
His hunger never forsakes him while
he lives. None of us are exempt from
it. I' i< one of (> » ! * W id-. \ > t,

"Man shall not live by bread alone,
but by every word that proceedeth out
of the mouth of God,"
The hunger of the head is as insa
tiable aH the hunger of the tooth, Bye
and bye the mother sees a flickering
consciousness. She thinks the baby
knows her. Bye and bye she is sure
baby knows, and bye and bye every
body is sure baby knows. No student
in four years absorbs as much as a
child in its first four years. It has to
learn a language and remember the
names of everything. The boy asks
questions. He sometimes gets
through at noon, it may be, leaving his
parents a half holiday. But few fath
ers and mothers cin remember about
that day. Hunger grows continually
and our universities are turning out
bread for the head. As one goes from
Oakland to San Francisco, he may see
a car-load of men, each with his head
behind a newspaper. What does that
signify? They have had a breakfast for
the body and now want something for
the mind. It is a discouraging quest.
If they fared as poorly at home for
breakfast, somebody would probably
have heard about it. Many newspap
ers might be appropriately named,
"The Daily Garbage Bucket." Every
day men and women wade through
them trying to pick up a scrap now
and then that they can digest. All
humanity demands nourishment for the
mind. Otherwise, why would men
wish to investigate the movements of
the planets? It is that which leads
them to ask, What is written in the
inter-stellar places? What is written
above the stars?
Hunger of the hand is superior to
hunger of the head. The child begins
to eat, to know, and then to do. It
wants to do anything and everything.
There is not a conceivable thing that it
will not do, granted a fair opportunity.
If a parent leaves a child telling it
merely what it is not to do, the child
will have a gymnastic feast doing those
very things; because it is human nature.
The proper course would be to supply
something to fill the place of the for
bidden amusements. Where were the
men in the car going? To earn their
daily bread they would say. Hut it is
not so. They are going to satisfy a
hunger. If their wants were supplied
they would work on. It is the hunger
of the hand that makes a man a king
above others. All athletic sports have
this at bottom. To do inspires us. To
know a thousand things and not do any
of them is to be a miser. Without
much knowledge, to do is nobler than
with much knowledge, not to do.
That life is very incomplete which
does not lead to the hunger of the heart.
It is not a natural soul which eats aud
docs, and does not love. It is nobler to
love than to be loved, though you seek
none in return. That hoy doesn't know
much about loving. He is the incar
nation of ingratitude as well as hunger.
Hut the time cimrs. Heretofore his

looked all right but now he peers into
the glass very often. lie is trying to
realize what kind ot a creature he is.
It is the awakeuing of a higher love
than he ever knew and it approximates
him more to God. A little stone thrown
into a pond of water makes a circle
which widens until it reaches the farth
est shore. So it is with a normal
love. It takes in the parents and
humanity; then dares to lift itself up
and takes in God and then it is eternal.
W hen the hunger has been satisfied
in all these ways, there is a deep, deso
late want abiding still. It has con
ceived an idea of spiritual excellence.
It has fed and learned and wrought;
but these are only functions. St. .John,
summing up the excellence of human
existence, said: "Behold! what honor,
what dignity, God has bestowed upon
us in calling us children of God." His
soul stood on the mount of exaltation,
on the mount of vision, and he saw that
being was the height of all existence.
Some can conceive of nothing but to
do. By going farther, the Illimitable
opens to us, for it is impossible to reach
the end of right-being. When this
gospel is applied to society, as well as to
the individual soul, a redeemed human
society will fill this earth. There is
no more enduring achievement than in
the lines in which Christ sets men
working. It is to build a new Jerusa
lem, and those who work with him are
the builders. If you would see the
complete man, find one who has been
standing face to face, not with the image
of Christ, but with Christ himself. 'The
things of this world pass away. We
cau know only in part. It is yourself
that is being built up, and these work
men of the city, these workmeu of the
new Jerusalem, are trying to make you
men and women in Christ Jesus,
