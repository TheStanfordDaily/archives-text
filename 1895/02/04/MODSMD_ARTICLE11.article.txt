One of the most persistent van
dals that afllict a suffering public is
the pencil tiend. His tracks on
walls and doors may be erased, the
chairs on which he has left marks of
misdirected class enthusiasm may be
varnished over, but when he takes
to annotating the margins of books
in the library, the injury becomes
irreparable. Not only does Ins un
h scrawl mar the appearance of
the page, but his comments on the
opinions of our greatest leaders of
thought are crude and trivial. It is
intensely exasperating for one to
find the pages of his favoiite authors
1 ringed with bigoted misconceptions
<>t some conceited underclassman.
The late corner in classes, the person
who discusses his own affairs during
lectures, and the pencil fiend belong
to one and the same category.
