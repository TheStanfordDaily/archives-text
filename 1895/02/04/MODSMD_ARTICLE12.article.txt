The bill against football, intro
duced into the State Legislature by
a young and enthusiastic assembly
man, is so trivial that it is even be
neath contempt. Even if football
were, as it is claimed to be, injurious
and brutal, it would be unwise and
useless to try to check it by law.
College men, whom such a bill would
altVct alone, are unanimously against
this ridiculous attempt to prohibit
the greatest of outdoor sports.
It does not matter that a few
presidents at theological seminaries
have forbidden football in their col
leges The same piotest was, years
j'go, made against baseball, without
injuring, in the least, the national
gjme.
'I he man who presented the bill in
question is a joung and compara
tively unknown aspirant for public
favor, who is trying to gain the pub
lic attention by sensational means.
In spite, however, of bis feeble chirp,
intercollegiate football will be
played long after Mr. North is dead
and forgotten.

This is the day of the track ath-1
lete. This form of sport is gaining
every year in popularity. The recent
arrangements made for international
contests and the contemplated re
establishment of the Olympic games,
all point to a near and rapid devel
opment of the lighter forms of ath
letics. It would not be surprising
if, in the next few years, the football
player would have to yield his su
premacy in college sports to the
track athlete. Present indications
certainly point in that direction.
It is time for Stanford to realize
.
her position in this matter, aud to
tutu her attention to fostering track
athletics. The new track is a long
step in the right direction, but it is
not everything. What we noed is
interest in the Student Body, and
enthusiasm among our athletes, The
undeveloped man—the man who
thinks that he can run or jump, but
is too modest to come out boldly
and try for the team—must be in
duced to train. Harvard's long su
premacy in track athletics can be
largely credited to the big squad
of candidates which has turned out
annually for spring practice. Jlar-|
vard men could always feel that not
only first place, but second and third
were iu competent hands, and that
the glory of the university was not
dependent on one or two individuals.
This state of things is what is needed 1
at Stanford, and it can only be!
brought about by an enthusiastic
and self-sacrificing .spirit on the
part of individuals.
