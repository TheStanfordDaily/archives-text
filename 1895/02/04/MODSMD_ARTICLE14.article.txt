Mrs. Emma P. Ewing, who is to
lecture next Tuesday evening on "The
Missing Link in the Food Question," is
a noted specialist in her line of work.
Fora number of years she was dean ot
the department of domestic economy in
the lowa Agricultural College, and re
signed this position to accept a similar
one in Purdue University, Indiana.
The demand was so great, however, lor
her lessons and lectures that she felt
obliged to devote all her time to gen
eral outside work. For the past eleven
years Mrs. Ewing has conducted the
summer School ol Cooking at Chautau
qua, M. V., having in her classes
women from every state in the Union.
She has lectured aud given lessons iu
all of the principal cities iu the United
States. Her lectures and lessons were
a conspicuous feature during the four
months of the Columbian Exposition at
Chicago.
This is Mrs. Ewing's first visit to the
Pacific coast, aud she will remain in
the west till April, when she begins a
lecture tour through the Southern States.
She is at present giving a course of
lessons in San Jose. Mrs. Ewing has
just completed a valuable book entitled
"The Art of Cookery". She is the
author of "Cooking and Castle Build
ing," a cook-book written iu the form of
a story, and also has written a number
of manuals of cookery. She is a clear,
forcible, and log'cal speaker, her lectures
are lull ol sensible and practical sug
gestions, aud she never fails to receive
the hearty endorsement ol' her hearers.
She reaches the hearts of the men in
the way that is said to be most effective,
and she instructs the women in her
audience how to make use of the same
methods.
