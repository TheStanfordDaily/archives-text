The Class of '9G seems at last fairly
launched into preparation for the social
events which this semester always
brings to the juniors. At the meeting
today, reports from the various com
mittees on junior day, on the business
and literary parts of the annual, and on
the farce, were given. ,Junior day will
come on the twelfth of April. The pro
gram will consist, in a general way, of
the farce in the morning, track athletics
in the afternoon, and the hop in the
evening.
An assessment of two dollars per
capita was levied to defray part of the
expenses of the annual, and the presi
dent was instructed to appoint seven
members of the class who are to act
with him in taking charge of the hop.
