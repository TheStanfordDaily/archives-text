# First Baseball Practice.
## 
### 
Last Saturday the first opportunity
was given to judge of our baseball pros
pects lor the coining season. Captain
Dyer recruited about twenty njen, old
and new material, on the oval, and an
interesting contest between two picked
teams was the result. Dyer, Sheehan,
Ilea, and Calhoun were the only Varsity
men out.
The game proved to the on-lookers
(hat a mighty effort must be made to till
the vacancies at catcher and pitcher
Heretofore we have been exceptionally
strong in those points, having Weldon
and Davey, and McLaine and Bumiller,
perhaps the two strongest batteries on
the Coast. A very fair infield nr-iy be
formed wiih Dyer on third, Piticus at
short, bheehan on second, and Cal
houn covering the initial bag. Good
mt n can undoubtedly be picked from
among the new candidates to fill out the
field. Piucus, Thompson, Fleming,
aod Co| e have been tr)ing their hand
at pitching, wbiie Ilea, Farmer, and
Hughes are essaying to till the back
stop position.
Ihe batting ot the game, as shown
below, was encouragingly free for so
early in the year The heavy batting
was done by the four Varsity men play
ing. Naturally, the fielding was not
iu> t<> the standard. The score follows
the game as accurately as possible in
view of the many pla\ers.
