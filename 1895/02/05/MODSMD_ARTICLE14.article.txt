All scholars are merciful with the
searcher for facts, but when it re
solves itself into a monopolizing of
the class' and professor's time by
needless or fruitless interrogatories,
patience is exhausted. It would ap
pear that some students imagine
they are entitled to receive more at
tention individually than the whole
elass in the aggregate. They take
advantage of the courtesy and pa
tience of the tutor aud unnecessarily
trespass 011 precious moments that
belong to all aud not to one alone.
IJjua tide inquiries, if not too num
erous, are excusable, but attempts
at cornering class time by one or two
members should be discouraged.
