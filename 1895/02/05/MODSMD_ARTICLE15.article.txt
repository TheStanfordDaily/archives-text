Tiie idea of inviting neighboring
preparatory academies to meet on
our track, which, by the way, oiigi
nated in the Daily Palo Alto col
umns, is iu a fair way to be tested.
Such b plan will be one of the best

possible means for increasing our
' uthletic timber. The scheme has
met with favorable reception at sev
eral of the schools in this vicinity
and is sure to become more popular
after tbe lirst few field-days have
been held. Every eil'ort should be
made to influence the " preps" to
enter at each meet. If this is done
there is'no doubt that the courtesies
extended them will leave in their
minds a favorable impression of thi-<
institution and its athletics.
