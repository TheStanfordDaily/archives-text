One of the first lessons which
most children learn, and one which
they would do well to remember
through their lives, is to refrain from
needlessly interrupting a conversa
tion. Several students in each class
seem to have forgotten or to have
become neglectful of this wholesome
rule, and as a result a whole class is
frequently annoyed and has its at
tention distracted during lectures or
recitations by an undertone dialogue.
Such conduct is indeed reprehens
ible, being, as it is, a disregard of
the rights of others, a disrespect to
the professor, and a discourtesy to
the class. The offense cannot be
too severely criticised; the sooner it
is put an end to, the sooner may a
student receive a more ample return
for the time he spends in the class
room.
