# George Kennan.
## 
### 
Mr. George Kennan was born just
fifty years ago in Norwalk, Ohio.
Canny Scotch and impetuous Irish
bloods mingle with the sturdy English
currents in his veins. His father,
.John Kennan, a young lawyer from
Western New York, had found home
and wife in what was then a small town
of Ohio. His mother was Mary Ann
Morse, daughter of a Connecticut cler
gyman, and was of the same family as
the great inventor of telegrarby, 8. F.
1» Morse.
Having scarcely reached bis majority

he secured a position in Russia as a
telegraph operator on the air line St.
Petersburg-Moscow railroad. Several
years experience iu this position gave
him an excellent opportunity to observe
the manners and customs of the Rus
sian people and to become master of
their language. lie returned to Wash
ington, D C , aud only a lew months
after his return to this country he had
the privilege of hearing a lecture on the
cruelties of the exile system. The
speaker was vebemeut iu his denuncia
tion of the method used by the Russian
government, so much so in fact, that
Kennan rose in the audieuce to t-ike is
sue with him on many points. Think
ing that he uiiaht learn more about the
true state of affairs, Kennan resolved to
return to Russia aud make a study of
everj phase of life. On his return he
was secured by the Century to take
another trip, and the result of his ex
poses as they appeared in that magazine
needs no leteration here
Mr. Kiuuan presents the striking
and interesting spectacle, not common
iu this practical modern world, of a
man consumed with fiery zeal for the
rescue of an oppressed people not his
own, of a life consecrated to a work cf
national deliverance inspired neither by
patriotism nor religion. Uue searches
history vainly for an »xact parallel to
the impulse which has made him voice
and hand fur a dumb and bound people,
remote from his own and alien to his
blood, having no historic or esthetic
charm, and with whose futile struggle?
his government has no political sym
pathy. The romantic seutiment that
sent Lord Ryron to Greece, and the
political sympathy that brought Lafay
e te to the Americau colonies are ab
sent, the despair of domestic liberty
that scut Polish aud Irish youth of
spirit and daring iuto foreign armies is
lacking. The environment is destitute
of all the temptations and incitements
that ordinarily inspire men with devo
tion to an alien cause.
(Jeorge Kennan has been the most
effective Russian revolutionist of a gen
eration; full of fiery energy, heroic
self sacrifice, reckless daring, and patient,
hopeless effort on the part of the Rus
sian people themselves. He was a
flame of revolt in Russia from the time
his own nature kindled, passing from
Siberian prison to Russian capital, com
municating now with exiles, now with
secret plotters, again with thinkers and
writers of the sort that nurse the revo
lutions of the next generation. Re
turned from Russia, he has been an
evangelist of her woes to the civilized
world. Proscribed from the empire he
remains in constant communication with
his fellow patriots in it, and is the chan
nel of the most accurate and ample in
formation of the interior conditiou of
that bound and stifled, shut-in and
thwarted people, that the world le
ceives. He has told America and
Kurope more of the real truth about
Russia in two or three years than it had
learned in as many ccnturies before.

Kossuth could have done no more for
Hungary in the United States. Maz
zini did less for Italy in England than
George Kennan has done for the Rus
sian people in the whole civilized world.
What manner of tyranny must it be,
the momentary sight of which, unveiled,
transforms a plain American citizen into
this sort of a fiery revolutionist? And
what is going to be the effect upon the
destinies of Europe of the story ho is
telling with the penetrating force of his
own deep earnestness, and writing with
the genuine inspiration of knowledge
and belief?
