# The 						Roble Masquerade.
## 
### 
The masquerade given at ltoble Sat
urday night to the young ladies of the
University, was the most successful one
ever held there. The costumes were
exceedingly unique aud each masquer
uder acted her part well. A short pro
gram, consisting of tableaux, dialogues,
aud fancy dances, was rendered. The
event of the evening occurred when
two young ladies, representing the Ex
aminer bears, made their appearance on
the landing. The audience room was
immediately deserted and the bears
were persuaded to lead the grand
march. Refreshments and dancing
consumed the remainder of the even
ing aud all adjourned feeling tired but
much gratified by the success of the
affair.
