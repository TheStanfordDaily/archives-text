Before tlie lecture last evening
I'le.-ident Jordan spoke briefly of
the failure of the Keilly Funding
bill and of the general condition and
prospects of the University. In his
judgment the claim of tlie Govern
ment against the Stanford estate
cannot possibly succeed in the
courts, and the only consequences to
be feared from litigation are the in
conveniences of delay. The passage
of the Reilly Funding bill was
hoped for, as any speedy settlement
of the present case would be. Ho
characterized the lately resurrected
report, that the University would
soon close its doors, as absurdly
false, and stated that " you will get
your money's worth here during this
year, next year, and years to come."
