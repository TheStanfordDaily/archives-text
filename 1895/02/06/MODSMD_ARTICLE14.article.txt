In* their over-straiaed attempts to
accommodate the U. C. representa
tives, the Stanford committee has
again revived a wan and almost for
gotten spectre —one which haunted
Stanford enthusiasts for two long
years, and which they would fain
have had pass away forever. With
out one single chance for the train
ing of a crew, an intercollegiate
boat-race has been arranged between
Stanford and Berkeley. Struggling
along as we have been in our vain
endeavors to complete a running
track, we have made our field-day
agreements from year to year with a
hope of having some sort of a track to
train on.
We have been doing this half-way
business long enough. After the
Athletic Board has provided a bo:t
and also some means of transporting
candidates for the crew five
miles down to the bay, which
is our only possible training
course, then and then only,
have they a light to perfect arrange
ments for an intercollegiate contest
With $1200 at our disposal two
years ago the formation of a crew
was proved impracticable. Let the
Athletic Board ignore the action of
the committee until twice that sum
is at their disposal. A contest with
Berkeley would then be possible,
and welcomed by many students
