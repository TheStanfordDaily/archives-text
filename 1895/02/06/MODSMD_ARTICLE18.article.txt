# President Eliot on Athletics.

### 
In the report of the condition of
Harvard College for the past year, under
the head of athletics, President Eliot
takes advantage of the opportunity to J
severely score athletics and especially
football. In substance he says:
The year 1893-4 wrought only one
unfavorable change in the conduct of;
athletic sports. It was at last made j
evident that most of the men who took
part in the competitive sports had been
year after year brought to the events in '
a state bordering on exhaustion, with ;
ibe single exception of the team for:
track athletics. The current academic j
year is witnessing a thorough change in
ibis respect for all sports.
The evils of the iutercollegiate sports ;
coutinue without real diminution. In
particular the game of football grows :
worse as regards foul and violent play,
and the number and gravity of the in
juries which the players suffer. It has
become perfectly clear that the game as
now played has become unfit for college
use. The rules are such as to cause
inevitably a large number of brokeu
l»ones, sprains, aud wreuches, eveu dur
ing legitimately played practice frames.
What is called the development of the
game has steadily increased its risks
until they have become unjustifiable.
It should be understood, however,
that the players are not entirely
responsible for these evils. They'
are swayed by a tyrannical pub- j
lie opinion — partly ignorant and
partly barbarous—to the formation of
which graduates and undergraduates,■
fathers, mothers, and sisters, leaders of
society, and the various gamblers and
rowdies, all contribute. A game which ,
needs an increasing number of men to
watch the players and to punish infrac- j
tions of the rules is not fit for genuine j
sportsmen. Extravagant expenditures
for the teams throughout the season
and by spectators at the principal
panics, coutinue to disgust the advo»
rates of simple and manly sports,
