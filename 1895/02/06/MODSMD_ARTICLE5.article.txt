# The 						Missing Link in the Food Question.

### 
Last night in the chapel, Mrs. E, P.
Ewing delivered an interesting lecture
to a good-sized audience on "The Miss
ing Liukjiri the Food Question." The
following is an abstract of the speaker's
remarks:
The food question which so perplexes
us today, did not disturb the equanimity
of our ancestors a hundred years ago.
Having comparatively little acquaint
ance with either science or cookery,
they thankfully ate what they could
get aud went through life unconscious
of the fact that the health and happi
ness of the average citizen depend
largely upon the character of his vict
uals.
In regard to the importance of scien
tific research upon food questions, I am
in hearty sympathy with the most ad
vanced thinkers of the time, hut as far
as investigations upon this subject have
gone, I am not willing to accept the
results of the investigators as conclus
ive. We all have friends who cannot
eat certain articles without disarrang
mcnt of their systems. May there not
be a vital truth in the old adage, "what
is one person's meat is another's poison"?
Scientists tell us that a loaf of wheat
broad weighing a pound, and made of

a certain brand of flour, contains about
two-thirds of a pound of nutrients, and
a pound of sirloin steak contains a
little over a third of a pound.
Now these may be truths, or they may
be half truths. The nutrition of a
loaf of bread, or of a beef-steak, de
peuds largely on the manner in which
the bread is made, and the beef-steak
cooked. A loaf of bread properly made |
contains as much nutriment, pound per
pound, as any other article of diet, and I
a beef-steak properly cooked contaius I
twice as much nutrition as a beefsteak
cooked in the conventional boarding
house style. And so it is with every ;
article of food.
Tea and coffee, I believe, when prop
erly made, possess considerable nutri
tive value. Also I have no doubt both
of them improperly made —as they
usually are —have no nutritive value
whatever, and are positively hurtful.
So with much of the bread and meat
and vegetables served and eaten at
American tables. lam confident that
a large proportion of our daily food is
robbed of its nutiition and rendered in
digestible and harmful by the barbar- |
ous manner in which it is cooked. The
physiologist tells us that raw cabbage i
with vinegar will digest in a human :
stomach in about two hours, while boiled
cabbage with vinegar will not digest iu
less than four and one half hours. He
cannot demonstrate why one article will
I accelerate and another retard the flow
of gastric juice; neither can he measure
the effect of flavor upon the digestion
and assimilation. Right here is the
missing link in the food question, and
the link will remain missing until the]
cook becomes as intelligent as the
chemist, or until the chemist becomes a
practical cook.
Chemistry ami cookery should go
hand in hand. An article of food may
be rich in various materials when sub
jected to a chemical analysis, but. de
ficient in nearly all of them when it
passes from the hands of the cook.
Flavor and nutrition arc intimately con
nected, and an incompetent cook, by
destroying the flavor of food, destroys
its digestibility and nutrition.
Scicnfic cooking is receiving much
attention at present,, but the cookery
taught under that title does not meet
the rcquirments of the masses. It
gives more information about the con
stituents of foods than about their pre
paration for the table. It fails to com
bine the practical with the theoretical
to a sufficient extent.
Asyetweknow comparatively little
of cither the art of cooking, or the
science of nutrition. And until the
cook has skill enough to develop the
subtlest flavor of every article of food,
the chemist has learned bow to meas
ure and classify, and the physiologist
possesses sufficient knowledge to assign
to them their respective functions in
the human economy, we will lack the
information necessary to enable us to
j supply the missing link in the food
question.
