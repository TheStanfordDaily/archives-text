# The 						Game This Afternoon.

### 
The Illinois baseballists met defeat at
the hands of the Washington team this
afternoon, aud again the vigorous West
has proven superior to the effete East.
It was not exactly a Chicago defeat, for
the Illinois men solved Moßride's
curves in one inning sufficiently to pile
up a respectable minority, llicks was
in the box for the Illinois contingent,
but after giving six or seven men free
passes to the initial bag, he retired ia
favor of the versatile Mr. Starbird of
Paulsen fame. The Washington men
had on their batting clothes, however,
and two-baggers and three-badgers
fairly rained over the adjacent fiilds.
The game ended at the end of the
seventh inning, the score being 19 to
11 in favor of Washington.
