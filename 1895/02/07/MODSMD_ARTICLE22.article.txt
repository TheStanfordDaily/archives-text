In view of the fact that Stanford
men have on their hands two very
important debates against Berkeley,
it will be interesting to know what
kind of tactics successful debaters in
eastern colleges have pursued. Yale,
in all her football glory, has in every
oratorical contest with Harvard been
clearly outclassed. Five successive
times the Eli's have met the Canta
brigians and have been theirs. All
through these debates Harvard has
clung to a policy of an earnest and
serious style of speaking, and has
avoided every approach to bombast.
Her manner of argument has been
characterized as quiet, logical—if
sometimes Platonic in its methods —
and convincing. There was no rant
ing, no sawing of the air, in short,
none of the rhetorical clap-trap which
characterizes the methods of the
stump-speaker aud the campaign
orator.
Stauford Nestors may be able to
find in these facts some food for re
flection .
