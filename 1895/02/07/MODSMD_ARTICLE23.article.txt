In certain respects many Stanford
students are grossly lacking in loy
alty to the institution. They poss
ess it to an unlimited degree in some
of its phases, but not in all. A foot
ball victory drives them frantic with
joy, a defeat, even in a minor game,
plunges them into deepest gloom.
I'hey proudly boast of our record,un
marred by defeat, in football, base
ball.[and intercollegiate debate. The
glory of our buildings, the beauty of
their location, the ability of the
faculty, the spirit of freedom of the
University, the greatness of its pres
ent and the vastness of its future
all these things move them to elo
quence.
But let some silly, baseless rumor
be launched and their loyalty suc
cumbs. Without considering the
foolishness of the rumor or the harm
its circulation will do the institu
tion, they listen to it eagerly and
diligently help to spread it. Ines
timable harm has been done the Uni
versity in the past by those most
deeply concerned in its welfare, the
students themselves. Groundless
reports have been started, students
have repeated them on the campus,
in San Jose, and in San Francisco,
and have written them home. At
once they have been spread in all
directions as coming from good
authority, from "one who is there
and knows." Loyalty would demand
that every student should deny the
truth of any rumor of impending
trouble, no matter how plausible it
may seem—that he should close his
ears to it, refuse either to give it
credence or to repeat it.
