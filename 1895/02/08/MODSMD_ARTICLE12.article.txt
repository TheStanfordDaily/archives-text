Thkee years ago a regulation was
passed designating what should be
considered as "Varsity sweaters,"
and who should be entitled to wear
them. This action was taken in
order to give a mark of athletic dis
tinction to those who proved them
selves capable of winning a place on
an intercollegiate team. The consum
mate tgotism and self-assurance of
the two or three pretenders who are
persistently wearing Varsity sweaters
to which they are not entitled, is ap
palling. To each we would say:
your laurels that you may be
proud of them. Don't let some one
else do it for you."
