The Students' Guild is now sys
tematically organized, and in the
hands of a competent committee.
It is a most creditable association,
about which too much cannot be
said in commendation. It will work
in a truly modern spirit, actuated
by ethical instincts, and transform
ing charity into reciprocal helpful
ness. No student assisted will feel
that he is the recipient of carelessly
bestowed gifts, but will simply be
as one of a large co-operative organ
ization, who has paid his share, and
is temporarily the one benefited.
Apart from the immense practical
value of the Guild, we expect from
it a new atmosphere of genial fellow
ship and great-heartedness.
