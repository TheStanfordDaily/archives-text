The flaring posters of the coming
" Extravaganzi," to be given by
Stanford talent, appeal to our sense
of humor, as few things in the mo
notony of college life have power to
do. They are suggestive and witty,
giving promise of fun and brilliancy
in store for us We congratulate
the enterprise and secrocy portrayed
by the mystic dancers and celebri
ties in our midst. We long to see
the gruesome corpse <h bcllei, and the
collection of beauties promised us.
We judge, by the foreign names on
the bills, that a number of outside
attractions are imported for the oc
casion. This reminds us of a per
nicious custom in some colleges
(eastern, of course) of importing
partners for Junior Hops.
This entertainment should be
largely attended, not only to en
courage home talent, but to assist
the Junior Annual that it may be a
financial success.
