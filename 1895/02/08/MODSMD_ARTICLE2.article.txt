# Collectivism.

### 
liuuronce (ironlund, author of the
"Co-operative Commonwealth," ad
dressed the class in Economics U in the
chapel this morning at 8:o0 on the
"Tendency Towards Collectivism."
Mr. Gronlund said he preferred to

call himself a collectivism which is
really synonymous with socialist; but
the latter term has come to be too wide
in its application. The collective state
will guarantee to the individual both
work aud suitable remuneration.
Nationalism proposes to treat all alike,
and communism to supply each indi
vidual according to his needs.
Remedies for social evils are to be
discovered, not inveuted, for society is
an organism, not a machine. I inquire
what the goal of the next generation is,
and not the goal of a thousand years
hence.
As a first step, the state should
furnish work to the unemployed.
Pennsylvania for oue hundred and ten
years has had a statute that every un
employed man who applies to the over
seer of the poor must be furnished tools
and raw materials on which to work.
I hope California will lead in adopting
such a statute, aud that she will not
only adopt it but euforce it as well.
Collectivism is inevitable. I hold
that this is a point that can bo proved.
It is manifestly God's will, aud I may
be pardoned for saying I believe I am
an instiuuieut in iiis hands.
Two things prove the nearness of
collectivism —democracy and the trusts.
\\'e have democracy iu politics. Col
lectivism is only democracy iu industry.
We have advanced in politics, but re
trograded in industrial freedom. In
iudustry we have aristocrats. Spring
Valley in Illinois is a terrible object
lesson in results. There the single iu
dustry is owned by the invisible, im
personal, conscienceless corporation.
All the miners are oppressed with the
dread of being thrown out of work as
i hey were a few )cars ago when the
whole country heard the groans of their
starving families.
The trouble is we are not, free. We
have liberty — absence of restraint; but
not positive freedom. Ihe liberty we
have is often license. It makes possi
ble the millionaire. It is the cause of
the recklessness of our youth — the
most undiscipliued in the world.
The power behind evolution will
force us to take the second step, the
step from political democracy to indus
trial democracy. Herbert Spencer is
wrong in calling evolution a slow pro
cess. It is slow, very slow, at first, but
it works faster and faster till at last it
is accomplished in the twinkling of an
eye. Collectivism may couie in ten
years. If ignorance predominates it
may require two generations and then
be established in bloodshed. Hut if
intelligent leaders arise it can be ac
complished in ten years.
The existence of the trusts not only
proves the early triumph of collectivism
but it proves that it is already here in
action. The trusts are collectivism in
operation, but for private benefit. As
soon as a trust has been formed, that
industry is ready for state control, and
the revolution, the decisive point in the
evolution, can be accomplished in the
twinkling of an eye.

It is as foolish to legislate against
trusts as against gravitation. They
are to be welcomed as a stage in evolu
tion.
Capitalists in the formation of trusts
have abdicated the right of private
management. They have become rudi
mentary organs — useless, therefore
harmful. In collectivism private prop
erty is not to be negated. That would
be communism. The individual still
owns it, spends it at will, saves it, and
bequeaths it; but there is a single re
striction—he cannot invest it.
