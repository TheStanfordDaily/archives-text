# The
						Mazatlan Expedition.

### 
The recent zoological trip to Mazat
lan, Mexico, was a great success scien
tifically. It was plauned and its ex
penses partly borne by Mr. Timothy
Hopkins. The party, consisting of Dr.
and Mrs. Jordan, and Culver, '97.
Williams, '97, Scofield, '95, Lamb, '98,
Stalks, sp , llichardson, sp., aud
Seward, '98, left here on Dec. 24. The
severe storms at sea marred the pleasure
of the trip down. With that exception,
the expedition afforded an agreeable
outiug aud vacation to both President
Jordan and the students.
The trip was a great success,
over three thousand specimens
of fish being collected, consisting of
one hundred and eighty species aud
among these twenty-five new ones, be
sides numerous birds and reptiles. The
party spent nearly all of the time in
the vicinity of Mazatlan, securiug most
of the fish by seining in an estuary and
along the beaches and around the
islands not far from there. In some
places among the rocks dynamite was
used. This collection of three thousand
specimens is the largest that has ever
been made on the Pacific coast. Over
three barrels of alcohol were required
to pack and ship the assortment. Most
of the specime will be kept here in
the zoological museum, but some will
be sent to the British Museum, to the
Smithsonian Institution, and to various
universities in this country and Ger
many.
The effects of the expedition can
hardly be overestimated, lor it has re
sulted in the discovery of twenty-five
species of fish hitherto unknown to
science. T. H. Lamb, '98, who was
with the party, has remained in Mexico
to collect a few more fish and will not
return until the middle of this month.
