Dr. Dille on "Perfect Manhood."
The sermon Sunday was delivered
by Rev. E. K. Dille of Oakland. Ilis
subject was "The Building of a Man,"
taken from the fourth chapter of Paul's
Epistle to the 13th verse:
"Till we all come unto a perfect man."
This phrase might have been rendered
a four-sided, complete, rounded man.
hood, or a lull, well-proportioned, sym
metrically poised manhood and woman
hood. What the philosopher desired
was a manhood that confronts life in
every direction. Sometimes I think
Mt. Shasta is a good type of the evenly
poised man. One must spend weeks in
its neighborhood, making a circuit
about it in order to get a just idea of
its magnitude. Looking from one di
rection, it is a huge double dome; from
another, a precipice; on oue side it is an
even slope, while from still another
point one begins to start in awe before
the lava crags and steel-grey granite
walls. It seems like a great high priest
of the universe. We know the topog
raphy of the country radiates from and
culminates iti tlii* height. Hut the
knolls and crags we saw are not Shasta
The dome we took to be Shasta is only
an accident.
So it is with man. The bulk, the
height, the forces that the man has, do
not make the man. The pursuits men
follow are mere incidents in their lives.
Men are not, great btcause they do
great things, but they do great things
because they are great. The height of
existence is not to do but to be. The
thing that is essential is the formation
i»l' an upright character. Geologists
tell us that it took the Almighty a
million years to build Shasta. It is
time to lay the foundations and set the
pillars ot your manhood or womanhood.
It, is a mistake to say man is the result
of surroundings, of climatic or social in
fluences. 'The true man makes his
circumstances. If there is greatness in
him, it must come out. Raphael would
have been an artist without canvas;
Galileo an astronomer without a tele
scope.
One side ot this complete manhood
is the physical. That meaus the per
fect play of every function. It is one
of God's best gifts. The main thing
about a vessel is whether or not it is
sea-worthy. Will it hold together?
Will this craft of ours hold together
until the port of three score years and
ten is reached? The mind can work
only through this organism Nature
does not usually put strong engines into
weak vessels. If a man has weak vi
tality, he must bear it; but if he has
brought it upon himself through di.'-
sipmiou and indulgence, he has com
mitted a crime against the highest law
of his being. When I see young men
carry the abomination of impure lives
into the holy place, when 1 see them
carry lust into the house of the Lord, I
cry within me, "Spaie the temple of
.Jehov.ih, Spare the temple of God."

While the true physical side of man
hood is important, it is not the most
important. I am glad that physical
culture is carried so far today. I am
proud of our boys who excel on the foot
ball field. lam glad that when the
Greeks put the human form on marble,
they had well-developed, well-propor
tioned models. Yet it takes far more
than the physical element to make a
man. Lord Nelson, who was only a
shadow of a man, was worth twelve
thousand Sullivans at Trafalgar. What
have mere athletes done to enlarge civ
ilization ? A standard that measures
men by their physical strength entirely
is barbarous.
Life's duties and emergencies require
preparation. They cannot be met with
out diciplined powers. Lightning
does not dart some other way because
you neglected to put up a lightening
rod. Emergencies come arid there
must be resources with which to meet
them. The lawyer must make an
extemporaneous speech, the editor must
write editorials hurriedly. There must
be previous preparation. No victory
comes by accident. Men must be ready
for the "tide which taken at its flood
leads on to fortune." Webster, when
asked how long it took him to prepare a
reply to one of Ilayne's said
forty years. There are a great, many
who plunge into active life too early.
They think they cannot be spared from
the world's arena so long. The world's
arena will wait. He who whets his
scythe will gain the victory over him
who commenced earlier. The world de
mands experts.
