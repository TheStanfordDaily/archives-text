Now is the time for displaying
true loyalty to the University. In
the days to come, when our alma
mater shall have taken the high
place to which she is destined, our
loyalty will not be needed. But
now, today, when Stanford's enemies
have a pretext for their injurious ru
mors, is the opportunity for display
ing our faith and courage. Half the
battle would be won if the students
and alumni should unite in placing
Stanford in the true light before the
public.
