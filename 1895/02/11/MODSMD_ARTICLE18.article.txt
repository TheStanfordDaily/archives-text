There is a growing disposition
from both insido and outside the Uni-1
versity to characterize Staniord as a
strictly California institution. A
tendency has arisen—not, indeed, a
marked one, but existant nevertke- i
less—to look upon any one not regis
tered from the Pacific Slope as a
sort of an interlopex-. The existence
in the least degree of such a feeling
is contrary to the spirit of the Uni
versity. The great gift was not
made to California, but to the world.!
It is true that the Staniord millions
were accumulated on the Pacific
Slope, and that our history has
been linked with the political hist
ory of the State. All these things
bind Stanford's traditions to Cali-1
fornia soil; but the University's use-:
fulness can be limited only to the
world at large. True philanthropy is
above and beyond race and section.
The generous design of the founders
was lor an institution whereby the j
means of truth and culture might be j
thrown open not only to the chil-'
dren of California, but to the chil
dren of men.
