# The 						Juniors Victorious.
## 
### 
The first of the series of inter-class
games was played off Saturday, '96 beat
ing '97 in an interesting game by the
score of 13 to 10. The Juniors owe
their victory principally to superior
work in the box. Though hit freely,
Itay way steady, and virtually'saved the
game in the ninth inning by striking
out Capt. Dyer with two men on bases.
Thompson's work in the box for '97
was erratic. Dyer did the pitching after
the third inning and succeeded some
what better. Neither side found much
difficulty in stealing bases, some of the
Sophomores proving quite expert.
Dyer led the batting with a double and
four singles, hitting safely every time
he came to the bat except the last time
in the ninth inning. Following is the
score in detail:
