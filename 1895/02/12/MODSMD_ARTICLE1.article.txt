# PINAFORE.
## To Be Given During the First Week in March. Sixty Persons Will Participate—Details and Cost. 
### 
Arrangements are rapidly being com
pleted for the presentation of the opera
Pinafore sometime during the first week
in March. Judging from the indefati
gable efforts of Director Connick, the
affair bids well to be a success in every
sense of the word, and a mere glance at
the list of those who will participate in
the affair shows that it. will include
the greater part of the musical talent
extant in the University. The cost of
the production will far exceed that of
any other student entertainment ever
given on the campus. The gymnasium
will be seated to accommodate about 800
persons. A large stage and dressing
rooms are being built, and a large pros
cenium arch will extend entirely across
the rear end of the gymnasium. The
stage settings have been arranged for in
the city, and an extensive system of
pulleys and slides will have to be placed
for the mere shifting of them. Several
hundred dollars will be spent in the
stage fixtures and costuming alone.
Kvery town between San Francisco
and San .Jose will be filtad with
circulars, and this alone should in
sure a big crowd, if printer's ink
eao do it. As one audience in
Eucina gymnasium could not possibly
pay the expenses incurred, the opera
will be put on for two consecutive
nights. The Baldwin calcium lights
will add greatly to the artistic effect of
the performance.

a rigid system of rehearsal under Di
