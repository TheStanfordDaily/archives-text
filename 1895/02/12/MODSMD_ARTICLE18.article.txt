rni ihe co npletion of the cinder
patb, which is to be the finest on the
' 'oast, track athletics at Stiuford
hbould receive a marked impetus. It
takes more tban a nood track, how
ever, to make good field men. We
must awake fiom our long athletic
lethargy if we desire to give Berke
ley a rub in that branch of sport on
which she prides herself Enthus
iasm does much to help along a good
cause; anil the vim of some of our
older athletes coupled with the
energy displayed by several mem
bers of '98. give promise of future
victory for us. It cannot be too
strongly impressed on the minds of
our trackmen and those who think of

entering for any event, that two
seconds are better in tlie end than
one first. Therefore we should send
up as large a number of second and
third rate men as can be induced to
develop tbeir ability.
The coach we had here fora few
days last week stated emphatically
that a large representative team is
desirable, for if you wish your best
men to win you can't enter them in
many races. If a man knows that
he has several contests ahead of him,
he involuntarily reserves a part of
his forces that might give him first
place; as a result he is beaten in all
his matches. But let him know that
all he has to look out for is one race,
and he will exert every endeavor to
win. Therefore we should have men
who can take second or third places
in every match, and reserve our best
men fora few of the most important
events; and this cannot be done un
less we have a big team.
