Stanford has notified Berkeley that
the subject for the intercollegiate debate
is: "Resolved, That in California any
legislative euactment, not deemed
urgent, shall be submitted to a vote of
the citizens upon petition of five per
cent, of the qualified voters, provided
such petition be made within sixty
days; and furthermore, that any meas
ure proposed by a petition of ten per
cent of the voters, shall be submitted to
the people by the legislature."
Berkeley is to be given one week in
which to make up her mind whether
she will take the affirmative or negative
side of the question.
