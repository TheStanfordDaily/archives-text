It is amusing to read the accounts of
football games published in foreign pa
pers. A member of the German faculty
at Yale furnishes a translation of the
Magdeburger Gazette's account of the
Yale-Harvard match. The article is
headed "Brutal Sport."
"The football tournament between
the teams of Yale and Harvard in
Springfield had terrible results. It
turned into an awful butchery. Of
twenty-two participants, seven were
so se\erely injured that they had to be
carried from the field in a senseless
condition. The vertebral column of
one was put out of joint, a second's
nose was broken, a third lost an eye,
and a fourth broke his leg. The rest
suffered severe internal injuries. The
inteution to injure each other in all
their attacks was evident and there
could be no question of accident. The
appearauce with the teams of a host of
doctors, ambulances, and attendants had
a gruesome effect from the start upon the
spectators." Ladies fainted at the awful
cries of the injured players. The in
dignation felt toward the brutality of
the students was powerful, but terror
so dominated the spectators that no
body dared to interfere," etc, ad nau
seam.
