# TRACK MATTERS.
## No Relay Team to Enter the Olympic Field-day Events. 
### 
It was expected that the work on the
track would be completed by the first
of this week, but unfavorable conditions
have caused delays, and enough work
still remains unfinished to require
several days' labor. Owing to the lack
of training facilities, therefore, no relay
team from Stanford will be in the field
on Olympic day, though Culver, '97,
Bernard, '90, Johnson, '90, Knowles,
'96, Fry, '95, and Copeland, '95, will
enter for various events.
Arrangements are being made to
hold a field-day on the campus ou
March 2, and another later in the
month. The contests will include the
regular intercollegiate events, with the
possible addition of a few special fea
tures. It is expected that there will
be a large number of competitors, The
annual class field contests will occur on
Junior day, April 12.
Tho rules governing the winning
and holding the Hammersmith &
Field trophy, offered for the 220-yard
run, have been decided upon. A per
son winning the medal once is entitled
to have his name engraved upon it and
to hold it, provided he remains in the
University, until it is won by some one
else. Alter being won three times in
succession by the same person, it be
comes the property of the winner.
It will be interesting to note that at
a meeting of the athletic clubs of San
Francisco, held Saturday evening, it
was dccidcd if the Berkeley field team
takes the proposed eastern trip, that
the proceeds of the Coast championship
games to be held April 27 should be
given them to help defray their expen
ses.
