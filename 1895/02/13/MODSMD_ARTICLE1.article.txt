# "THE FRIENDSHIP OF BOOKS."
## An Interesting and Instructive Lecture by Prof. Hudson. 
### 
I shall try to set down some simple
reasons why it will he well worth while
for every one to cultivate a taste for
that magnificent literature which is en
shrined in our common English tongue.
There are many occupations and callings
in which the material furnished by a
generous acquaintance with the great
masterpieces of English verse and prose
films part of one's regular equipment;
many others in which systematic literary
»tudy offers a necessary discipline which
cm be obtained in no other way. It
will he quite evident to all of you that
a man who seeks a career in any field
of literary activity cannot begin too
early to make himself familiar with the
great writers of the English-speaking
world; and equally evident that in all
the learned professions there is need
lor the special training which only lit
erary culture can afford. But the
question which I want, you to consider
has no connection with matters such as
these. I want to {help you to under
stand the relation of literature to gen
eral life. Are we to value it simply for
its practical worth as part of the cur
riculum which is to help earn our daily
bread? Or has it not rather a larger
and wider, a deeper and richer signifi
cance, which should appeal to us all?
When the time comes for you to leave
your charming homes, some of you per
haps will enter on an academic or pro
fessional career, and many will pass
into practical affairs dealing with the
every-day lacts of life. I want to try
to convince you that no matter what de
mands may bejmade'upon your attention
or time, the treasures of our English
literature you will not see fit to neglect.
I want to make you understand that any
lite that holds itself'aloof from the cul
ture which literature yields, must, for
all its material ' success, fall short of
human completeness. And I want to
help you to realize that now is your op
portunity to cultivate for youtselves a
love for the good and true and noble
books; and thus to lay up in early life
interests and resources which will prove
things of beauty and possessions for
ever.
I have often heard it said by practi.
cal people that literature can never be
anything more than a mental luxury.
They ask of what service English poets
and essayists and dramatists can be to
them, why should they bother them
selves to cultivate a taste for Shakspere
and Milton and Tennyson, Carlyle, ltus
kin, and Emerson ? This is a familiar
question which arises out of the busy
life of high-pressure activity, and it is
just such I want to take up. Litera
ture is not the dilittonti, milk and
water thing, the frivolous pastime, the
intellectual dissipation, that some people
make it out to be. It is something
which belongs to us all, that should
enter into the inmost composition of
every life; and he who refuses to have

anything to do with it must face the
fact that existence for him will be all
the narrower and poorer in conse
quence.
There is one thing which ought to
lead us to feel that a love of literature
brings with it its own peculiar satisfac
tions, and that is what those who are
best qualified to judge give utterance
on the matter with no uncertain sound.
The testimony'iof such men is of infi
nite value because it is not the narrow
testimony of the mere scholar, but the
opinion of persons who tried lile in
many ways.
And now let us point out some of the
ways in which the love of literature will
help to enlarge our lives. We often
hear it said that literature will not help
us to earn our daily bread. Such a re
mark is natural. Only a few years
ago a gentleman's education was a very
narrow thing. It consisted chiefly in a
drill of the classics, some acquaintance
with the modern tongues, and various
accomplishments connected with such
pursuits. Now we have altered all
that, we have striven to make educa
tion a practical thing. It is quite right
to lay stress on the practical side of
knowledge, but is there not another
side of the matter of equal importance?
Is life to have a margin? You should
remember that life will have its leis
ure as well as its business, its pleasure
as well as its toil ; and if you are
wise, you will soou come to realize the
immense possibility for good or evil
which this margin of existence is going
to throw upon your hands. Nothing
distinguishes the truly educated man
from the man who not educated so
much as the extent, variety, and qual
ity of his marginal interests and activi
ties. How does a young man spend
his spare houis ? The answer to that
question will give you all the standard
you need to judge the reality of his cul
tivation. A man who is educated will
soon find time hanging heavy on his
hands. lie will have his own resour
ces, and amongst these,will be a love of
great and good books, and an appreci
ation of all the wit and wisdom, the
knowledge, and inspiration with which
their pages are fraught.
You will never find a man who has
learned to love books driven to despair
because he lias nothing to do. He has
created for himself a souroe of pleasure,
a fund of interest that only grows with
the drafts that are made upon it; be
cause he has discovered a source of
happiness which will never leave be
hind a sense of uneasiness and disgust.
"Ye are not made," says Dante, "to
live like the beast, but to seek virtue."
Now, let us deal'with the taste of
reading by inquiring into the value of
great books as a direct means towards
a higher culture of our lives'.
The essence of any true book is the
personality of which it is the outgrowth.
There is no disguising the fact that in
the most of us the power of personality
is but very slightly developed. Now,
I believe that a large part of the cul

ture-value of literature lies in the fact
that through the study of great books
we are enabled to get into close and
immediate contact with some of the
largest, freshest, and most magnetic
| personalities that the world has ever
! seen. It has been well said that every
J great and original writer "brings into
the world one absolutely new thing—
his own personality, with its unique
1 mode of envisaging life and nature";
and his book is'of fundamental interest
in so far as we can enter into touch
with that personality, and realize in our
own nature something of its bracing
and life-giving potentialities.
Dooks are for men and not men for
books. They are not to dictate to us.
but to help us. Literature is the in
terpretation of life, actual and possible,
and wo read them that we may have
life and have it more abundantly
A word should be said regarding the
value of poetry. Many men in this
practical age look upon poetry as a de
partment of ethics altogether divorced
from life. We should go occasionally,
at least, to the great poets to look at
the world from their point of view.
Poetry is more than an ingenious
way of talking nonsense. It is a criter
ion of life from the point of view of
the feelings, and is therefore a neces
sary part of a complete philosophy of
existence.
And now it remains to add that if
literature is to yield all that it may and
will yield to those who study it aright,
you can not too soon begin to cultivate
that love for the great and good books
of the world.
I shall try to set down some simple
