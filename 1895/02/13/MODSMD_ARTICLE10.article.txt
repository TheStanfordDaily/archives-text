It is unfortunate that the Library
department is handicapped at pres
ent in its purchases by the lack of
available funds. Were it not for
this, the invaluable libra-y of the
jate I'rof. Hildebrand of Leijzig, of
fered to the University through Dr.
(lOebel, doubtless would be pur
chased without delay. The rare

value of the library and the richness
in the very fields in which Dr. Goe
bel and Dr. Flugel are already
justly celebrated, as well as the fact
of the great utility it would have for
all the language departments, make
it urgent that some means be devised
for securing the necessary funds. No
time should be lost, for other uni
versities will only bo too eager to
grasp the opportunity.
