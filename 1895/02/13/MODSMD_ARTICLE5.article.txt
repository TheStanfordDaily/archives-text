# A
						Philological Treasure.

### 
A few days ago Professor Goebel re
ceived a cable-despatch from Leipzig of
fering to the University the excellent and
large library of the late Professor Hilde
brand. During recent years the libraries
of a number of German scholars were
bought by American colleges, but prob
ably none of these libraries can be com
pared in richness and completeness
with that of Professor llildebrand. It
will be remembered that Hildebrand
was one of the continuators of Grimm's
" Dictionary," and the whole working
material of llildebrand, comprising the
entire lield of lexicography and German
literature, is of course contained in this
library. Goethe and the Folksong hav
ing been one of the specialties of llilde
brand, it can easily be imagined what
treasures his collections in this branch
must contain. Pesides he was a dis
tinguished classical fcholar, well versed
in English, French, and Italian philology
and literature, and there is no doubt
that all the language departments of
our University world would be im
mensely benefitted by the purchase of
this rare library.
