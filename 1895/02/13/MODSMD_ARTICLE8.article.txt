As far as it is possible to do so,
the managers of oar various athletic !
teams should arrange the events be-1
tw\en Stanford and Berkeley so that
they will fall ou holidays. The i
manager of the University of Cali-1
fornia team is desirous of having!
the iirst intercollegiate baseball con
tent come off on the Berkeley campus
on .March 2i5, as that date is Charter
Day for the State University. Tore
lu-e to play them on that date be-j
cause of lack of time to practice, is
uo excuse for Stanford. It is as fair
for one team as for the other, and !
our deplorable financial condition ;
makes it imperative that the date for
games throughout the teasou be
lixcd to suit the crowds.
