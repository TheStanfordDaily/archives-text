Dijkixg the last three months the
chapel lms been used almost contin
uously by vaiious organizationsâ€”
t e Pinafore choruses, the (ilee and
Mandolin Clubs, and others. It is
natural that some wear and tear of
furniture should result from this use,
but the real damage done has been
excessive. The carpet has been
lipped through the moving of the
j-iitno; the furniture has been
scratched and marred; the books
mistreated; and the windows have
been used, to a greater or less decree,
us means of entrance and exit. It
is asserted by a reliable party, thut
unless better care is taken of the
chapel and its fixtures, restrictions
will be placed on its use.
