Dr. Haweis evidently misjudged
the intellectual worth of the audi
ence which gathered in the chapel
last evening to hear his discourse on
"Tennyson and Tennysoniana." To
those who went merely to be enter
tained by the grotesque utterances
and odd gesticulations of a quaint
individual, the lecture was a decided
success. The speaker proved him
self a king of storytellers, and few '
could have bettered his dramatic re
cital of "The Northern Farmer."
lint it must be remembered that L)r.
I Haweis has appeared on the chapel
rostrum several times before. Each
appearance resulted in gathering to
! hear him larger audiences than have
; turned out to listen to any other per
son who has consecutively addressed
the students except the president of
the University himself. This hold
which Dr. Haweis had obtained on
Stanford audiences was the natural
tribute due a man of such colossal
intellect and versatile imagination—
a scholar of the nge.
With such an opinion of the
speaker, it was natural that the
chapel should be tilled last evening 1
to hear what was to be said about the
greatest poet of the nineteenth cen
tury; to hear the utterances of a man
who had been thrown in contact
with, and perhaps imbibed much of
the personality and charm of the
dead poet-laureate. It is safe to say I
that most of the audience went away
disappointed. The lecture was an
entertairnnent'from beginning to end
The speaker digressed to such an
exttnt that he supcifieially covered
the field of poets and the poetical
from ilotner to Oliver Wendell
Holmes, with an amusing story of
his first introduction to Tennyson
I thrown in between acts. In order
to give sway to his dramatic powers
the lecturer gave to bis audience far
from what would be considered Ten
nyson's most powerful fragments.
Many of those that were rendered
underwent the prostitution of
changed diction and rhythm to such
an extent that few students ot the
great poet failed to notice thtm.
That Dr. Haweis could have told
his audience far more about Tenny
son than he did in his lecture last
evening, we have do doubt. lie
under-rated his audience, however,
and instead of telling them what he j
! knew about one of the grandest
; and noblest figures of this or any
other age, grasped the opportunity

I making himself the chief clown in a
two-bit show.
