# "American Charities" Reviewed.

### 
The following is a clipping taken from
the February Review of Reviews per
taining to Dr. Warner's recent book,
" American Charities."
While this is the first comprehensive
treatment of American charitable agen
cies, it is also almost unique among
works of its class as an example of the
descriptive, expository method applied
to topics which are usually interpreted
through the medium of more formal
statistical tabulation. The book
abounds in statistics, it is true, but the
tables of figures, dry and compara
tively meaningless by themselves, are
illuminated by the context, and the dis
cussion of tacts and theories which the
figures serve to reinforce is interesting
and stimulating in the highest degree.
The various channels ot American
philanthropic effort are tersely de
scribed, and the underlying principles
are set forth with a clearness that
would have been impossible but for the
author's expert knowledge and practical
acquaintance with the problems which
to lay confront organized charity
throughout our land.
The book is to be especially com
mended to legislators and meml>ers of
boards having control of public phil
anthropic institutions of every class, in
the third part,devoted to "Philanthropic
Financiering," ]Jr. Warner handles the
((uestions connected with the adminis
tration of public charities and subsidies
to private charities in a peculiarly ef
fective wiiy. His remarks on charity
organizations are also helpful.
The worker, whether official or vol
untary, in any department of philan
thropic activity, will receive inspiration,
as well as profit, from Dr. Warner's
book; for the tone is a decidedly hopeful
one, although difficulties are candidly
seated. Its bibliographical notes are
numerous and useful.
