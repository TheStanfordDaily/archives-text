## Kant Hardleigh's Great Specialty Troupe Reaches Palo Alto. What the Celebrities Have to Say of Themselves and Their Impressions. 
### 
Kaut Ilardleigh's Vaudeville Com
bination arrived at Palo Alto this after
noon, and are quartered at a down-town
hotel. A representative of the Daily
Palo Alto called immediately and
was cordially received by Manager
Hardleigh. Interviews were readily
•.'ranted by the different members of
the company, the account of which is
published exclmire]y in the Daily
I'alo Alto, a journalistic ieat which
has set the whole University agog, and
compared to which the Hawaiian ex
ploit of the Chronicle pales into insig
nificance. Manager Hardleigh is con
fident of a highly successful engage
ment at the gymnasium. The whole
seating capacity of the spacious audi
torium has been already sold, and the
significant motto "S. K. O." will doubt
less be seen tomorrow night.
VVherever that company has ap
peared it has been greeted with ova
'lons. ( Lat. oaituH, from ovum, an egg )
In all the principal cities of Europe
and the United S'ates the populace
have gone mad and farm produce of va
rious kinds has been at a premium.
No such unique combination is recorded
in the annals of the civilized stage. It
is >afe to say that those who are so for
tunate as to gain admittance to the
gymnasium tomorrow night will witness
a spectacle approached only by a Fac
ulty night for bicycle instruction. The
gymnasium has been completely reno
vated for the event, several more elec
tric globes giving it a fairy-like effect.
Owing to the necessity for enlarged
space the stationary bar, vertical rope,
and tumbling mat have been removed,
making one of the most commodious
and elegantly appointed theatres west
of Dornberger's Hall.
Manager Hardleigh courteously pre
sented the reporter to the different
artists,all of whom expressed themselves
a* delighted with the University. The
" Quadrangle Troubadours," intelligent
looking colored persons dressed in the
height of Redwood City fashion, were
lounging on the broad porch of the
hotel smoking expensive cigarettes of
the Piscano brand, with which Man
ager Hardleigh keeps them constantly
supplied. These singers have traveled
extensively. Shortly before the hor
rible double murder in Sacramento, the
Troubadours gave a concert in that city,
which was so frightfully stirred up
about it and other outrages, that the
citizens went armed for fomo time.
These artists produce a sensation where
ever they appear. Los Angeles and
other cities are clamoring fir them, but

the trip is not favored by the club as
there is u very little money in it at
present."
Signor Rossignol is a bird, to use a
current phrase. The reporter found
him singing in the'parlor, but he kindly
stopped for several moments. He
comes from an old line of ecclesiastical
ancestors, many of whom have beeu
abbots, but in early youth he elected
the exciting life of the stage, preferring
it to a life with the organ and the monk.
M.de Lai, the silver-voiced tenor of
the company, had not yet arrived but
was expected sooner or later. He has
no equal in that class of music where
humor is blerided so delicately with
pathos that it produces in the hearer,
as Signor llossignol said in his imagi
native way, ''Thoughts that do lie too
deep for tears."
The King of Clubs is a drawing card 1
in the organization. He has spent!
much of his life in the laboratory, and 1
his wonderful creation, the ' Dance of l
the fireflies," is said to have made j
Mine. Herrmann turn all colors of the
rainbow with envy. This talented man
is an adept with all kinds of clubs,
managing them with incredible dexter
ity. He confessed, however, that he i
thought the Kncina Boarding Club 1
would weaken him.
M me. Calliope Cardinale, the es-j
teemed siren, sent the reporter word I
that she wou'd see hiui in her boudoir,
where she received him graciously.
She is a tall, handsome wouiau of the
disez blonde type, with massive vocal
cords and an imposing figure. She ex-'
pressed much pleasure at appearing be
fore a Stanford audience, and regretted
that her first appe.iranee would probably '
be the last .she would be permitted to 1
make. Her voice is a rich soprauo, full
of tender dove like notes and sympa-j
thetic vibrations, brilliant in execution
aud absolutely true. Mine. Cardinale
has a borrow of singing flat or sharp,
and will not «xcuse it in anyone else. I
The diva ha* had a triumphant concert
career, and should be given a reception i
here second only to that accorded cer- '
tain engineers.
Herr Sandow was seen with difficulty, I
for he was in a bad temper. ' What,"
thundered he at the dismayed reporter,
"do 1 hear that some one calls himself |
Hercules here? 1 defy him, and desire |
a meeting. Sandow shrinks from i
nothing, however hazzardous." The
great wrestler was in no mood to be in
terviewed, so the reporter hunted up
Banjo Surely, the sweet warbler of Te
hatna St. He found him with his crony,
Dancing Tom the champion clog
dancer, and spent a pleasant few mo
ments chatting with these two gifted
beings who arc by nature intended for
a warmer climate. Banjo Surely is suf
fering from a severe cold, and his banjo
has but one string; this latter trouble
he hopes to remedy at the Physiological
lab. His friend, the nimble-footed'
Tom, was in high spirits in spite of
.Justice Wigle and public opinion.
The newspaper man found Mile.

Maccaroni, the petite Parisienne dans
euse, reclining gracefully upon a sofa
and igniting a cigarette with luxurious
Trilbyness. She was altogether charm
ing. Smiling archly at the admiring
reporter, she said in beautiful French:
"Ciel, e'est outosite, cette place, n'est
ce pas? Parlez vous du ding dong,
m'sieur? " The reporter replied timidly
that he spoke "un petit peu de Sym
ingtonaise." The danseuse laughed
merrily, and cried: "0, goodnees, let's
talk English, then. Do you know, I
just love this place. Everybody at the
train was so cordial; why, there were
several who wanted to take me to drive
at once. Everyone is so kind to us.
Nearly everyone I have seen seems to
have a wheel " She smiled wickedly
at the reporter. •' But really I have
to rest before my dance, it is so fatiguing.
There are twelve yards of silk in my
skirt, aud you know that's a dreadful
responsibility for any woman. No,
most emphatically, I do not believe in
dress reform on the stage or off." Here
the dancer sprang to her feet with an
impulsive gesture. "Oh, don't be
alarmed; there's no kick coming," she
said in her pretty foreign way, "but it
does make me so ennvye to see woman
neglect the blessed gift of long trailing
skirts when they can make the whole
world cleaner by tbeir presence. But
to change the subject, I do wish I could
be here for the Sophomore Cotillion.
I am sure there will be some wonder
fully unique daucing at that party,
and I might get points, you see.
No, I don't know Eleanor Calhoun.
Everybody asks me that. 1 am
quite sure, however, that she has never
appeared at the Folies Bergiers, my
theatre, you kuow," and Mille. Mac
caroni gave the reporter a dainty ciga
rette which he will treasure forever.
The reporteralso talked with several of
the original Mandolinatas, whose music
is known and appreciated even by the
untutored denizens of Berkeley. Un
fortunately he was unable to see any
thing of the famous corpse de ballet
over whom society and the Faculty are
on the qui vice. Manager ilardleigh
said that they had gone up to the
cinder path for an hour's practice and
would not be back until dinner. The
dancers are in hard training and are in
the pink of condition. They are the
crowning feature of tomorrow evening's
entertainment aud must be seen to be
appreciated.
The gymnasium doors will open at
7:80. Light refreshments will be
served, and altogether the performance
will be an event in Stanford's dramatic
history. The unparalleled generosity
of Manager Hardleigh in tendering this
elaborate benefit should draw to the
gymnasium tomorrow night not only
all lovers of the beautiful, but every
true friend of that greatest of all books,
the Stanford Quad.
