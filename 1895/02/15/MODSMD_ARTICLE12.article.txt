In order to induce all the students
ut Harvard to take systematic exer
cise, the proposition is being consid
ered to make athletic training count
towards an A. B. degree. It has
been found that unless some incent
ive is given to induce students to ex
ercise regularly, their physical train
ing is neglected almost entirely. Of
course those interested in athletics
exercise some, but even they are
somewhat remiss in respect to syste
matic development. The vast ma
jority of college students go year
after year without proper training,
though they realize its necessity and
importance. It will be interesting
to note the details of the method
that Ilarvaid adopts to overcome
this attitude on the part of the stu
dents.
