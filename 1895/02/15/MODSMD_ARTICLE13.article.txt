A gieat deal of complaint is heard
Hgainst the lengthy lessouß given by
various professors, particularly those
in the English department. Stan
ford students justly have the reputa
tion of being thorough and consci
entious workers, and if they in large
numbers complain that they are
overworked there must be some
truth in the assertion. Nearly
every one carries as much as be pos
sibly can, and feels it an imposition
when certain professors impose upon
his good will and ambition by task

ing his powers too fur. The students
appreciate the hearty interest and
co-operation of the professors in
their work; and, as a rule, try to re
spond to the appeal for more and
better work, but they object to an
uneven distribution ot'their time and
energy.
