The football enthusiasts at Berke
ley have already gone into training
for the coming season, presumably
in the belief that victory can be ob
tained only through a long course
of training. The plan ia certainly a
wise one, and excellent results are
sure to follow. It shows that Berke
ley is terribly in earnest, and will
leave nothing undone that will tend
to give them victory next year.
There is a good suggestion in all this
for our men. If we allow our
selves to be handicapped as we were
last year, it ia highly improbable
that we can overcome the advant
ages that Berkeley is sure to obtain
through her present plan. We all
kuow with what discouragement we
were confronted last Septem
ber, and how fortunately they were
met, but it is foolish to hope that
such good fortune will always fol
low us. Some such plan as that
adopted at Berkeley should be fol
lowed here.
