Tuerk seems to be a feeling cur
rent that this 3 ear Stanford will
make a much better showing in the
°
intercollegiate field-day than she has
done in the past. Some enthusiasts
even go to the extent of claiming the
meet will be a hotly contested one. I
These persons have left certain ele
ments out of their calculations, i
Berkeley's past supremacy in rack
and field athletics doubtless has at
tracted better material to her in her
freshman class than ours contains.
Besides, this supremacy has created
an enthusiasm there, for this branch
of athletics,which does not exist here.
And, most potent factor all, this
year the rivalry at U. C. will be in
tense. A place on the team that will
go East, possibly to take part in the
Mott Haven meet, at any rate to be
pitted against various teams on the
other coast, will be the greatest ath
letic honor ever won by a U. C, man.
This fact alone will ruise Berkeley's
team high above that of any former
year.
To be sure, we will have our new
track, great enthusiasm, and our
proverbial pluck. But nothing
should be neglected that will in
crease our chances of winning ad
ditional points.
A trainer is a very essential factor
in this branch of athletics. Not
only must the men be coached— j
they need some one to keep them
trainiug. Otherwise, the average
man neglects it under pressure of j
other matters, and then shortly be-1
fore a meet rushes in and overtrains.
It is generally conceded we should
have a trainer, and there should be
no delay in subscribing the amount
necessary to secure one.
