# "The Loftiest Ascent of Man."

### 
llev. 11. F. Maclaren of San Jose de
livered the Sunday sermon. His sub
ject was"The Loftiest Ascent of Man."
He took for his text Revelations, chap,
iii, 20th verse: "Behold, I stand at
the door and knock; if any man hear
my voice and open the door, I will come
in to him and will sup with him and he
with me."
I wish to speak of that which apper
tains to the highest in man, without
which he cannot attain to his God-given
destiny; God's call to the highest
life possible to humanity. It is often
irksome to be called to live a different
life. Men would perhaps rather have
old ideals of success, of what life ought
to be, and of how it should be lived.
It is with society as with the individ
uil. When the call comes, there are
those who shrink from it. Before the
llevolution, a great many people would
have been loath to give up the quiet
ness ami peace that surrounded them
and to see the old customs pass away.
But God had something better for this
p< op'e The shout of the lit volution
spread around the world. He was call
ing a nation into being. In connection
with that call was one of the greatest
epochs in the world's history.
This call always comes from within.
It is from the unseen world. The
grandest possibilities of lil'e ate made
impossible if we shut ourselves out of
thi- communion with God. It is the
gc.ni lis of man's nature to wish to seek
the unknown, to i»eizH the intangible,
to hear the inaudible, to see the in
visible. Associated with this com
munion is what we call prayer. Some
say God will not interfere with natural
(Muxes to answer prayer. We can hear
prayer and save men from natural
causes ourselves. Nature, if unmolested,
will work out a certain condition of
things; but intellectual power can dis
cipline the forces of nature. tVe can
make the lightning jjo down a light
ning-rod; we can go against wind and
w.ives; we can save men from the nat
ural course of their own livts if we ex
ercise our God-given power. Shall we
deny to God power that we have our
selves ?
'•I stand at, the door and knock."
There is no sound that can affect you
like knocking. You sometimes awake
in the ni»ht. You hear footsteps on
the street, hear things creak and rustle
in the room, without thinking much
about it. Hut. when you hear a knock
ing you are alarmed. It, is the sound
of a hand. There is a heait behind it.
vVhen Macbeth hears the knocking at
the gate, the strong man of many bat
tics is afraid. (Jod knocks at doors
where he has been rijected; he knocks
at strangers' doors and Christiais' too.
■There are too many young men and
women who are keeping Christ out of
their thoughts today. He who rejects
Christ condemns himself to an existence
which is low indeed There are those
who feel that religion shuts men out
from the most delightful of the world's

experiences. It is not bo. There are
those who enter the Christian life with
a great deal of mournfulness. Christ
does not come to taunt you with your
faults. He conies to sup with you.
Christ has need of you. The college
graduates have always been men of
powerful influence. Wesley and Whit
field of Oxford, are men whose names
have gone around ihe globe. Giants
are born into the world when men give
their whole heart to Christ. He whose
life is hid in God, goes out a mighty
one to mould the destinies of men.
There is freedom of man's knowledge.
Destiny brings us so far and then we
must choose our own way. May every
heart be opened wide. May each of
us have a loftier ideal and live the life
that is hid with Christ in God.
