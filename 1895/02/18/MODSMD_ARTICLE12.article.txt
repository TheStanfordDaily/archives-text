The managers of Saturday night's
entertainment deserve great credit
for its financial success. Few people
realize the difficulties that have to be
surmounted before an afi'air of this
kind can be brought about. In the
present instance the obstacles were
many and discouraging. The very
novelty of the thing was in itself a
difficulty. The fact the venture was
a financial success reflects credit not
only on the manager and his assist
ants, but on the whole Class of '96.
