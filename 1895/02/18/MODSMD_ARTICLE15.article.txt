The increasing disposition of pro
fessors aud instructors (o put stuÂ«l

ents upon their lionor in examina
tioDS is a long step in advance. It is
a matter of personal observation
that those professors who leave the
room entirely daring an examination
are the ones who have least to com
plain of in the way of cheating. One
of the largest and best of the New
England universities attributes its
freedom from dishonest papers to
this very method, tbis placing trust
in the honor of students. The pol.
ice professor can never prove a check.
There are so many ways of evading
the closest scrutiny, that one who is
determined to cheat can almost
always do so with impunity. Even
setting aside utility in preventing
cheating, the spirit of the honor
method should be its argument.
