A shout time ago the under
classes were warned in these col
umns against excesses in the matter
of inter-class contests. It is to be
regretted that a necessity has arisen
for repeating that warning. When
any class refuses to rush it gener
ally does so for good and sufficient
reasons, not because of cowardice or
inability. In the case in question,
the Sophomores refrained upon di
rect solicitation of the upper-class
men, who were unwilling to injure
the attendance at the vaudeville.
Their refusal should have been re
spected. The conduct of the Fresh
men in this affair is not likely to add
to their prestige, either as individ
uals or as a class It is true, indeed,
that they went into the affair
thoughtlessly, and that the state of
things is to blame iu the matter.
They have only followed the example
set by preceding classes of engaging
in inter-class squabbles anywhere
and everywhere.
For the sake of peace and order,
let us inaugurate with the opening
of next semester a new method of
conducting rushes. Let the upper
classmen get together at the begin
ning of the year and arrange fora
big, noisy rush, such as will fill with
joy the souls of the under-classmen.
Then let the outcome of that strug
gle be final and decisive. The pres
ent bickerings and taunts come
dangerously near hazing.
