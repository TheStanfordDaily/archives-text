# Sophomore Cotillion.
## 
### 
Tickets and invitations to the Soph
omore Cotillion are being sold with en
couraging rapidity. To remove some
misunderstanding in regard to the
tickets it seems necessary to state that
there are no restrictions which prevent
anyone connected with the University
from buying tickets or invitations. No
list has been made aud no committee
passes upon names. The invitations
are sold for fifteen cents each, the ap
proximate cost of engraving, and make
an elegant souvenir of the first Sopho
more Cotillion for any student and espec
ially sophomores to keep or send to their
friends. Desiring to keep on the safe
side, the committee ordered a limited
number and the supply is rapidly di
minishing, so persons wishing them
should apply early to some member of
the committee: Miss Alice Colt,
Messrs. W.M. Mcintosh, F. W. Lake,
J. M, ltoss, and C. A. Thomas. In
vitations and tickets are also on sale at
room 78 Encina.
