# The 						'96 Vaudeville.
## 
### 
The gymnasium was packed to the
door Saturday night by the admirers of
Kant Hardleigh's troupe of refined (?)
vaudeville artists. The program was
enthusiastically received in spite of the
scantiness of stage accommodations and
the rather long waits.
The Quadraugle Troubadours in
gorgeous costumes, led by a dusky in
dividual on crutches, opened the pro
gram, and were enthusiastically encored.
Mr. Hetherington, thinly disguiped in
burnt cork, followed in an exhibition
of scientific club-swinging. The in
terval between this and the next num
ber was filled by the gallery gods in local
repartee.
Mr. De Lai followed with a sympa
thetic rendering of Newman's "Planta
tion Lullaby." It was impossible to
guess at the identity concealed under
the Fretch soubriquet, but it was noted
that De Lai appeared on the program
in his right place, having arrived on
time.
Abbot, '98, the other soloist, dis
played a rich, sweet baritone
carrying power.
Mcintosh, '97, took off the honors of
the evening in dancing. Arrayed in a
blond wig aud a bewildering costume of
cardinal, he performed a "serpentine"
that set the gallery gods wild with de
light. lie received a rousing encore.
It was then announced that Mr.
Sandow could not appear, owing to an
unsuccessful struggle with an Encina
meal, but his place was taken by Code,
'95, and Painter, '98. This number,
though hardly popular with the co-eds,
was loudly applauded by the gallery.
The contest was declared a draw, each
having obtained one throw. The wres
tling was hard and scientific.
Mile. Calliope Cardinale made the
hit of the evening. Dressed in the
college colors she rendered a soprano
solo in the true heavy-opera style. At
the end of her first appearance several
of the uninitiated in the audience were
positive that the singer was really a
woman, and their mystification was in
creased when, at her third encore, the
lady made use of a deep bass voice and
ended in a regular operatic shriek.
Her nom tie plume is said to be
Carolus Ager.
Fleming, '98, did some clever clog
dancing.
Shirley Baker sang several plantation
melodies in his own inimitable style.
Interest was centered on the last
number, the "Parisian corps de ballet,"
composed of Field, McGrew, Mcintosh,
Frankenheimer, and Campbell. Ar
rayed in blond ,wigs and # the gauziest
of costumes, they went through the
mazy evolutions ola trained ballet.
McGrew, as the "Hawaiian premiere,"
was particularly graceful. They might
have pinned a few shawls to their skirts
with advantage, but this is neither here
nor there. It is needless to say that
the affair was a financial success.
