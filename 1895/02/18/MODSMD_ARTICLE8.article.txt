# '97 Wins Saturday's Game.
## 
### 
Saturday's contest between the Soph
omore and Freshman nines was won by
'97 by the score of 13 to 6. The re
sult was, in a great part, due to the
wilduess of the Freshman pitchers.
The contest was a pretty one for six
inniugs. The Freshmen started out like
winners and held the lead until the
fourth inning when Cope went to pieces
and '97 got six runs on three hits, a
wild throw, and four bases on balls.
The Freshmen evened up matters a little
by scoring three runs in the next inn
ing, but Mcßride, who replaced Cope in
the box, gave the game away in the
sixth; in this inning three bases on
balls and three men hit by the pitcher,
together with a couple of siugles, gave
the Sophomores five more runs. This
settled the game and neither team
played with much spirit after the sixth
inning.
Dyer's batting was again the leading
feature of the game. Dyer, Young, and
Thompson did all the batting for '97
while Su)der, Pincus, and Jeff' did
the best work with the stick for '98.
Jeff'and Thompson both caught well,but
the latter was a little offin his throw
ing. Young, Hazzard, and Klauber did
some clever fielding. Dyer pitched a
good game and fielded his position well.
Pincus pitched the last inuing for '98.
