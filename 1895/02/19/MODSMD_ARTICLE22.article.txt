JiiNctNA residents and their visitors
are complaining that there is no at
tention paid by the hall authorities
towards keeping a directory of stud
ents' names and rooms where it shall
he available at anytime. Ihe great
est annoyance is experienced in
locating a student unless the office
happens to bo open. There is no
special pleasure nor gain in inquir
ing where a fellow student is
located, and then following up the
too often elusive incorrect clues
given. A little pains by the com
mittee would obviate this trouble
and confer a benefit on the Encina
ites.
