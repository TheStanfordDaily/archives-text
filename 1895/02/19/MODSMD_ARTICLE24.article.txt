The Pioneer class, as became its
opportunities, lias made a name for
its enterprise in the inauguration of
class and University events. Yet in
one important case it has left the
lield open for those stanch admirers
and disciples of '5)5, the present
sophomores, to win the gratitude of
iunumerable classes to come. The
Sophomore Cotillion next Friday
night will doubtless usher in this
particular class event with due eclat.
The interest being manifested in it is
second only to that aroused by last
year's Junior llop. The committee,
in spite of the numerous obstacles
unreasonably placed in its way, has
so perfected arrangements that the
Cotillion is assured.
