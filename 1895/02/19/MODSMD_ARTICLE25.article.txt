It is about time that our baseball
stars should begin hard practice for
the intercollegiate matches which are
billed to occur at no distant date.
This year, if any, Stanford is in good
condition for defeat. Tho only way
that it can be warded oil' is by per
fect team work, and that can't be
obtained in a few days—it requires
weeks of practice. Thus far, not a
single Varsity practice game has
beon played that is in the least way
encouraging. Such scores as have
been made show a lamentable need
of better fielding and a mediocre
style of pitching. If all our Pioneer
"fans" would go to their old places,
a great gap would be filled, en
thusiasm would be created, and '05
might say with pride on graduating
that old cardinal was never lowered
on the diamond while the Pionter
class was in the University.
