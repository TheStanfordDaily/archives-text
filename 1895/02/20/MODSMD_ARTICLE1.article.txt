# The 						Common Schools of England
## 
### 
Prof. Barnes spent some time study
ing the English schools last summer
and a large part of last niglit'a lecture
was drawn from his personal observa
tion.
English schools, like all other Eng
lish institutions, have developed under
the stress of actual conditions; to under
stand it one must kuow the lines of its
development. Down to this present
century England had no system of
schools lor the common people. Un
der the influence of tl e movement for
monitorial instruction, started by Bell
and Lancaster, two societies were
formed to care for elementary educa
tion. The National Society was sup
ported by the Established Church, and
the British and Foreign School So
ce»y was supported by the Dissenters.
These two foeities founded schools all
over England, and after 1832 they re
ceived some government grants to aid
the'ii. In 1870 the English govern
ment established the first state elemen
tary schools in England, and in 1892
education in all the elementary schools
was made tree. Thus the present sys
tem is really three systems in one.
Kaoh of the great school societies sup
ports schools and the government or
board schools fill the gaps.
With the freeing of education three
y«*arn ago several burning questions
came to the front. First of these is
the social question. Middle-class Eng
lighmen have never believed iu edu
cating the masses, and everywhere
there is a feeling th.it popular education
will overturn class distinctions, as it
probably will. The tellers are at
present looked upon as servants, and no
physician or moderately well-to-do
tradesman can send his children to
the board schools without losing caste.
The second question —religion. The
schools have always existed for purpose
of religious propagandist!). And now
that they have become state institutions
the question becomes, What shall be
done about religious instruction? Moat
of the late fall elections were fought
over this issue and the Liberals gen
erally won. The secularization of
English education seems inevitable.
The financial question also presses
for solution. The school tax has risen
in twenty years in London from half a
penny on the pound to eleven pence on
the pound, and the new educational
plant required by free education is only
begun.
The general educational problem is
being met by several new lines of
schools. The laundry and cooking
schools and the special schools for de
fective children were especially de
scribed. There are no free secondary
schools in England and no free higher
education. Both of these are, however,
being agitated. England is entering
on a new field of public education, and
from her experience we shall learn much-
