This is the title of the first of a series
of publications planned by the eutei
prising publishers, Smith & Eaton of
San Jose. They are making an effort
to include in"The California Literary
Series" a collection of work done by
California writers which will in time
serve as a nucleus fora distinctive Pacific
Slope literature. "Pages From a Young
Man's Diary" is a book of one hundred
and twenty poems by Edward D. Cast
erline. The work as a whole is worthy
of an author of greater fame, though
many of his narratives lack in original
ity. Price, 50 cents.
