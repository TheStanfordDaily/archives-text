Judging from recent copies of the
Berkeleyan which have come to our
table, that sheet is making a desper
ate struggle for existence. Of
course it was to be expected that
any new journalistic venture would
have many obstacles to surmount on
the start, but it is contrary to the
laws of nature that any individuals
with " prep " school ideals should be
able to carry on successfully a full
fledged college daily. Last Mon
day's issue was gotten out by the
combined eflbrts of nineteen individ
uals. As different editors are
worked on the four issues per week,
this would indicate that seventy-six
editors and business managers push
their pencils each week in their vain
endeavors to keep the ship afloat,
not to mention the many contribu
tions and communications which oc
cupy no small space in its pages.
Despite this innumerable company
and the fact that Berkeley has direct
telegraphic and railway communica
tion with Temescal, Milpitas,and the
Oakland mole, every second issue
comes to our desk late. The other
issues, however, have an unlimited
news supply. Column after column
is filled with childishly writ
ten matter vilifying the Daily
Palo Alto and every other institu
tion or idea which has a tinge of
Stanfordese.
The two-column exhaust of last
week charges this paper with inten
sifying intercollegiate rivalry, and
only winds up its little speech with
other accusations so untrue, un
gentlemanly, and indelicate that they
will pass unheeded. The former
charge, however, needs a few words
<»t' explanation. It has been the
policy of this paper from its estab
lishment to do its part towards
keeping down an iutensity of feeling
v\hich Berkeley leaders kindled at a
theater party held three years ago
utter that great football game in
which the Stanford "kidlets" made
"doormats" out of the well-trained
but over-contident U. C. aggrega
tion. Ever since that beautiful and
entirely legitimate "let-down," the i
Berkeley papers have had a bone to
pick with what they were forced to
consider a worthy rival.
The Berkeley an, in particular, has
tuken a stand spiteful in its policy,
vulgar in its tone, and beneath the
dignity of the college it is supposed
to represent. A long article recently
appeared entitled, "Physical Train

iug for Girls at Stanford University"
which contained statements from be
ginning to end which were utterly
false, yet which teemed with delir
ious siliness which eminently be
came its co-ed composer. A lon#
editorial advocating that Berkeley
and Stanford discontinue the hiring
of eastern football coaches, ends with
the harmonious remark that if Stan
ford cannot see that their reasoning
should be followed "then they are
numskulls indeed."
Hecause the Stanford committee
objected to men being played on the
Berkeley teams wheu they had only
five hours work in the art school,
the lierlceleyan, champion of purity
of speech and the soul of magnanim
ity, comments: "It is hard to im
agine how men who are supposed to
have as little sense as the law allows
anyway, can dream of asking for such
ridiculous provisions." We might
go on quoting like examples which
would till many columns.
No, Stanford has not taken the
initiative in rivalry, but has dis
couraged it at every turn. Did you
ever hear of a Stanford professor
haranguing a crowd of students to
pass sore-head resolutions denounc
ing the judges of an intercollegiate
debate because these judges did not
think that there was quite [as much
logic in speakers' remarks
as did their infantile supporters?
Did you ever hear of a certain Berk
eley professor, who, on hearing of the
government suit filed against the
Stanford estate, appeared at a stu
dents' mass meeting, and with the
most exultant enthusiasm pro
claimed: "Yes, boys, we'll down
Stanford now; the glimmer of her
glamor is no more." ? Oh, the mag
nanimity of Rome! Wilh such
noble, manly enthusiasm rankling in
the breast of every U. C. supporter,
is it any wonder that Stanford stood
triumphant in the great Thanksgiv
ing Diy battle? The wonder is that
Berkeley did so well. Her iras
cible policy of the past does
not augur well for the future
But let every Stanford man laugh
aside any such attempts at hard feel
ing; take rather the position that
becomes you—a magnanimous vic
tor towards a fallen foe.
