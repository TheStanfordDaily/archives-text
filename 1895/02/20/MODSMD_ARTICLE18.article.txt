The following appeared in a lute
(lumber of the Wave of San Fraucisco:
The readers of the Wave whose ed
ucation embraces a knowledge of the
German language will feel gratified to
know that Stanford University harbors
one ot the foremost German poets of
today, Professor ,Julius Goebel, Ph. I).
in his essay on "The German Poetry
of America,"he has demonstrated his
tremendous reach in grasping this pe
culiar branch ot a literature that,
though without the prestige of the soil
and national as well as natural environ
ments, has grown to huge proportions.
This essay will be a classic; breathing
as it does an intense love for America,
it is, nevertheless, Germanic instrength,
poetic in touch, and exquisitely delicate
in finish. Hut the swan-song of the
youug poet is his lately published
"Gedichte" (poems), Dresden and Leip
zig, E. Pierson, publishers. One does
not need to have labored at the poet's
bench to recognize the wondrous charm
of these "poems." There is a magnet
ism, a divine attraction about them
that none can withstand.
His hymns on the occasion of the ceu
teuuial ot Washington's inauguration is
what the Germans call "flauimen sprue
hend." His "llaphsndie," which in
troduces bis poems, has the ring of the
German classical period. Permit tne
to quote one stanza. 1 would not dare
10 attempt a translation.
"Mein Griechenvolk, der Erde Zier,
Jch athme deine Seele.
Ich theile Lieli' und Grail mit dir,
Dein Lob und deine Fehle.
Und was der Gott in Innern schafft,
Die sing' ich's selig wieder,
Kin Ilauch von deiner Heldenkraft
Durchbrauset meine Lieder."
Forsooth, the poet uttered the word
by which his poems ought to be judged.
"A breath of heroic Greece sweeps
through iuy songs." Longfellow un
dertook the task of gathering the best
products of European poetry in a vol
ume which he callcd "Poets and l'oetry
ot Europe." Lt were well if some one
with the divine afflatus would translate
the German poetry of Germans in
America, and when this is done, fore
most among the best will stand the
German classic poet at Stanford, Pro
fessor Julius Goebel.
