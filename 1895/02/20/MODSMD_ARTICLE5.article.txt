# Stanford Cycle Club.
## 
### 
An enthusiastic meeting of Stanford
wheelmen was held this afternoon, and
the bicycle club is now assured. The
committee appointed some time ago to
draw up a constitution made its report,
which was adopted. After considerable
discussion "Stanford Cycle Club"was
adopted as the name of the organization.
The question of membership was a
debated point, owing to the tact that
the club organized by the women ex
cludes men from membership. It was
thought advisable at first,to follow theex
ample of the co-eds, but better counc.l
prevailed and it was decided that any
student or member of the faculty of this
University may become a member of
the club.
An attempt is to be made to arrange

with Berkeley fora hundred-mile relay
racearound the bay. It is important,there
fore, that our beat material be repre
sented in the club. The track at the
stock farm is being rolled down and our
men expect to begin training immed
iately.
The next meeting of the club is an
important one. The adopted constitu
tion will be presented, and all persons
who desire to join the club should be
present to sign the constitution, and
thus become charter members. The
officers—including a president, vice
president, secretary and treasurer, and
captain—will be elected at the same
meetiug, which will be held next Tues
day (Feb. 2G), 1:30 p.m., iu the
Physics lecture room.
