# Berkeley's Proposed Trip East.
## 
### 
The Olympic has the following to say
about Berkeley's proposed eastern trip:
"Berkeley has finally decided to go east
and compete with Pennsylvania and
possibly in the intercollegiate champ
ionships. Berkeley has some athletes
that are as good as any in the eastern
colleges. Were they to compete in
the intercollegiate championships,
though, think of the teams they would
meet! Take these colleges collectively,
Berkeley would find arrayed against
her such talent as would com
pletely snow her under. In meet
ing Pennsylvania, though, that is
different, hut they will make a big
mistake if they compete in the inter
collegiate?. In reference to their com

petiug in these championships, where
all the big colleges strive for honors,
Berkeley would not have more than ten
or twelve men men against something
like two or three hundred. It is not
the point of this article to detract any
thing from Berkeley in regard to their
having tirst class athletes, as they cer
tainly have; but where they have one
pood man tor an event, a dozen will be
pitted against him. We think Berke
ley had better think twice before she
decides to compete in the intercollegiate
championships.
