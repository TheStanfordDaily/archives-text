# Football at Harvard.
## 
### 
The vote id' the faculty of Harvard
recommending tlie abolition of football
has caused considerable excirement
among the students of that institution.
Though it is not believed that the game
will he positively prohibited, it is
thought that games outside of the cam
pus will not be allowed
I'lof. S'agg, of Chicago University,
is reported as giving the following
opinion on the matter
Harvard s faculty has always or
nearly always, taken a position hostile
to intercollegiate sports, 1 presume
this fact is due largely to President
Eliot. When I was at New Haven
Harvard men were discouraged by the
same spirit. In the fall of 1880 foot
hall was positively forbidden, and Har
vard was not represented on the grid
iron. Ahout the same time baseball
also fell under the ban. But anybody
who knows anything about the history
of Harvard's athletics knows that these
frequent prohibitions have had little
effect. Harvard men have also from
time to time beeu enjoined from play
ing in New York City. These restric
tions have been the laughing-stock of
the country, especially of Yale.
