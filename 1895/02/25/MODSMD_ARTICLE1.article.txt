### 
Rev. K. J. Duprey of San Francisco
delivered the sermon Sunday. His
subject was "Shame-faced Christians,"
and his text, "For whosoever shall be
ashamed of me and my words, oi him
shall the Son of man be ashamed, wheu
he shall come in his own glory, and in
his Father's, and of the holy angels."—
Luke ix , 20.
Actually as we look around us, as we
study society, it seems that the progress
which we may find in material lines has
not been followed in moral lines. It
seems strange that comforts in moral
lines are greater than they were in the
past, and yet man has not attained the
highest standard. If we turn to the past,
when our ancestors were more ignorant,
we find that they had more wide awake
ciiiiscienccs. Today pe< pie know a
great deal about a great many things;
but they are ashamed of the Son of
man and of his words. It is strange
that m this country, which is looked
upon as the most (. hristiau country,
there is a strong majority of people
who aie ashamed of the Master. They
are willing to undergo certain troubles
and tests fir the sake of the Lord.
I hey will be good Christians in the
church. They will be eloquent in
prater meeting. Put when it conies to
everyday life, they are merely citizens.
They winh to be no more. The Ameri
cans have a double nature —the church
man and the business-man. And they
are too alraid of carrying religion into
everyday life. We dispose too much
of our life according to method. We
think there is a time for everything,
t hat we must be good at a certain hour,
and attend to business at another hour.
Among the rising generations there
is a tendency to belong to church. It
i* a good thing to have our names in
the book. It i.« a good thing to have
our names on the church pew. But it
is better to bea true Christian in all the
walks of life. We think not enough
of Christ. We think too much of our
selves. Why is it thus? Because we
do not bring the personality of Christ to
the world} if we do, we are only willing
to do if in an indirect manner. Why
are there so many of our Christians
ashamed of the Lord ? Because wo
have lost sight of the real principle of
life. If we struggle to make life bet.
ter, we havo an aim. And we must
have an aim. We must go upward as
well us onward if we would attain any
truly great achievement. When I
hear people speak of the brevity of life
and the importance of our getting out
into the world early and building up a
strong material kingdom; then I fear we
will be ashamed of the man who was a
God, who had scarcely a friend on
earth and yet loved the world to the
hitter end, who gave himself up for
others that he found struggling for the
very things he had disdained. If you
go through the houses of Paris, wher
ever you find Christian people living
you find at the same time the most in
tellectual classes. Those who have the

strongest creative powers are those who
are not ashamed of the Master. The
progress of moral life is injured by set
ting Christ aside. It is like the set
ting of the sun behind the clouds. The
whole world is darkened.
The weak point in our religiou is this
double life. I visited a very fashion
able church in New York City one day.
The minister was reading from the
prayer-book that ancient but still beau
tiful Litany. Between the responses I
could hear a couple in front of me con
versing. "Are you going to that sup.
per tomorrow night!'"' "The Lord have
mercy upon us." "You are? So am
1." "The Lord have mercy upon us"
And it pained me to see that instead of
their taking their religion into the
world, they took their worldliness into
their religion. In America man has
only a Sunday conscience. If he had
a conscience every day, he would be
ruined in business, because society to
day is based upon false principles.
There are business men who make fine
prayers, it does a person good to hear
them. Hut these same men make their
living by grinding down the poor. Sa
loons and gambling dens exist because
Christians are afraid to sweep away all
that corruption. Oh! the indignation
of Christ was right and good when He
censured the Pharisees and Publicans.
And if we were consecrated Christians
we would not hide ourselves, we would
not pray to the church ou the one
hand and to the prison ou the
other.
We may not be rich if we arc Chris
tians, but we will gain riches of a bet
ter kind. How can we hope for any
betterment of a community wheu
people are wavering and afraid to speak
their minds? We have morality and
immorality, religion and heathenism,
honesty and dishonesty at the same
time. The world has been going on
for centuries, shaken with fever. We
do nothing and then complain of mis
ery. We are the builders of the
country. ll' we build it wrong, it is
our own fault. If we are ashamed of
conditions that will better society, the
world will not improve. We must
have strong convictions, strong hearts,
and pure minds. If we are not
ashamed of Christ, if we have enthusi
asm, where people are cold or luke
warm, we can hope to accomplish some
thing. But we need perseverance
and assurance that the victory is at
hand We can have th<! victory if we
will
Be not ashamed of the Lord. He
will work for you if you are not
ashamed of his will and command.
