The fact that a majority of the
events iu the Olympic field-day Sat
urday were won by Stanford men
does not prove Stanford's superior
ity on the track by any means.
Many of tho best U. C. men were
not entered in these races; most of
those who woro the blue and gold
wero second-rate men. Nevertheless,
the showing made by Stanford is
encouraging, especially when the
state of the track is taken into ac
count. All of our winners did as
well or better than tho scratch men.
This shows the result of the renewed
interest in track athletics, and Mr.
Hunter's careful training.
A victory over Berkeley may not
come this year or next year, but the

present policy is the very thing i
which will make it come in time. A
few years ago, when Yale became
interested in track athletics, Harvard !
was winning everything in that line,
but a steady following of the very
policy which we have adopted led to
1 Yale's brilliant victory in 1894. The
tirst steps in the right direction have
: been taken, but energy and deter
mination alone will insure tinal suc
cess.
