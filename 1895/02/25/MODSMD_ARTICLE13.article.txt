Now that the spring festivities are
ujjon us, our lack of proper stuge
accommodations becomes apparent.
At the recent vaudeville semi-trans
parent strips of muslin served as
dressing rooms, the bare walls of
the gymnasium were in evidence at
the sides of the one piece of scenery,
and the impromptu sliding curtain
had a way of refusing to budge at
critical moments. Besides, the ar
rangement of even these primitive
attempts at scenery called for an al
most incredible amount of trouble.
Why could uot some of our musi
; cal organizations give an entertain
| mont to equip the gymnasium with
portable stage, scenery, aud cur
tains? Such appliances could be set
up aud taken down with very little
trouble, and would prove adequate
to our present needs.
