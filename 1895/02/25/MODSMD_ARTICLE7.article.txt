# Friday and Saturday Baseball.
## 
### 
Two games of baseball were played
on Friday. In the morning the two
fraternity teams representing Zeta Psi
and Delta Tau Delta crossed bats, the
former winning by an easy scoie.
Kennedy and H. 11. Brown filled the
points for the losing team, while Lewis
and Baker formed the battery for the
winners.
The third game of the inter-class
series was played in the afternoon be
tween '95 and '98. Owing to the
superior fielding and base-running of
the Seniors they won with ease by a
score of 20 to 7. Rea did most of the
pitching for '95, Lewis going into the
box for the last three inninps, while
Russell caught. Cope, Hill, and
Farmer did the hatter)* work for the
Freshmen in creditable style
The Varsity practice game on Satur
day afternoon was by far the best ex
hibition of baseball seen this season on
the campus. By placing McLaine and
Russell as the battrry on the second
team very even batting resulted.
Pincus, '98, played a good fjauie at
shortstop, while Lewis led at the
bat. Following is the detailed score:
