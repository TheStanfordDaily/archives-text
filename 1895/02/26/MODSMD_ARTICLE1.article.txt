## Stanford's Fine Showing in the Olympic Events. 
### 
Stanford has a right to feel encour
aged and elated over the excellent show
ing made by her track men in the
Olympic Club's field-day. Out of six
entries, to win five firsts and a second
besides second in other heats is a
record to boast of. Each of the men
who took part made a creditable show
ing against all contestants and in three
cases the work of the men was magnifi
cent. There is little wonder that many
Stanford students can be found who are
ready to assert a close score when the
rival college men meet.
Despite a wet and slow track Cope
land, '95, one of Stanford's mile men,
made the 1000-yard run within a second
of the coast record. Copeland was a
scratch man yet he eat-ily passed all
contestants, showing up specially strong
in the final dash. The time made was
2:25 flit. It is safe to say that in the
best of condition, on a fast track, Cope
l.nid can lower the coast record two
seconds at least.
It is to he noted also that Toombs
did not need his handicap to win the
hi;:h jump, and from his work down
here it is sufe to assert that he could
have cleared two inches more if neces
sary.
Our bicycle reputation is in sale
hands with Charles Frazier at the
pedals. We may miss Alexander, but
Frazier's exhibition gives rise to the
idea mat lie can just about take Alex
ander's place. The Cull <rives the fol
lowing account of Frazier's performance
in the final:
The final was as pretty and well eon
tested a race as could he imagined,
though the three men who opposed
Frazier did everything short ot commit
ting deliberate fouls to prevent the lat
ter from winning. Molt, wiih his 150-
yards handicap, set a warm pace, and it
took fast pedaling to catch him—a feat
which was only accomplished after nine
laps had been ruu. Then the jockeying
between Cowell and Sohlueter began.
They tried to pocket Frazier, aud not
succeeding in that, ran him so high on
the turns that they were themselves in
da*>ger of going over the banking.
Riding easily, and with the precision
of a machine, Frazier slipped through
everv tight place, and shot his bolt as
the hell rang for the last lap, and just
after gaining the lead on the lower
turn. lie went away as easily as though
his opponents were back-pedaling, and
kept up his terrific gait through the
•entire last lap in spite of all the effotts
io head him off.
Schlueter made a last desperate ef
fort to catch him as they swung into
the stretch, but Frazier gained at ev
ery turn of the wheels and crossed the
tape, smiling back over his shoulder at
his crestfallen opponents. Schlueter
was second and Cowell third. The
time, 9:02 was fast, considering the na
ture of the track and the weather.
Frazier rides like a veteran, and it is
said that he is a Canadian, who has re
cently arrived on the coast. He is cer
tainly able to make the cracks ride to
the extent, of their ability, for in heat
ing Schlueter he defeated one of the
Acme's best men.

The following were the events in
which Stanford men contested with the
time made:
The third heat in the hundred yard
sprint was wou by Gill, 0. 0., from the
scratch. W. Knowles of Stanford
made a good showing. Time, 10 4-0
seconds.
The 1000-yard handicap brought out
a large field of starters and was won by
Copcland, scratch, ot Stanford, after a
magnificent spurt through the bunch
on the last lap. Time, 2:25.
Toombs, Stanford, wou the high
jump, clearing 5 ft. 5 inches.
Dole won the pole vault with 9 ft.
10 inches, lie had an 8-inch handi
cap.
The running broad jump went to
Stanford, Culver getting first and John
son hpcoud place. Distance cleared,
20 ft. 7 inches.
Chas. Frazier won the first heat in
the three mile bicycle race in 9 min.
15 sec., and the final heat in 9 min.
2 sec.
Stanford can say with Berkeley that
she lias several good uien who did not
compete, and yet she managed to pull
more points out. of the events than any
other team entered.
