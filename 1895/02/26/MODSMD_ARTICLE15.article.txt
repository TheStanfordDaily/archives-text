"What is miue and what is not
mine" seems to be a meaningless
phrase to many patrons of the En
cina reading-room. Their disregard
of this phrase is manifested in many
ways, the most leprehensible being
the removing of magazines and
papers to their own rooms; and
the clipping of articles or pictures
from the different periodicals. The
first offense is not so bad as the latter,
for those who remove the files
usually return them to the tables,
simply depriving their fellow board
ers of their joint rights; but where
papers and magazines are mutilated
by cutting, there is no way of mak
ing the disfigured and incomplete
journal good again. Such acts of
vandalism deserve the severest con
demnation.
