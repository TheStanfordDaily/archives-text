Quite often a professor iusists on
bringing the subject he is discussing
to a satisfactory close. Some of his
Htudeuts. in their unwillingness to
be late for the next lecture, cause
ii ore or less confusion in their prep
aration for departure. The profes
sor glares at them and puts them
down as rude and inconsiderate. At
last they are dismissed and hurry
off belated, maybe to a distant build
ing. Coming in late here to the dis
turbance of the beginning of a lec
ture or recitation, the poor unfor
tuuate student falls a little iu the
good opinion of another professor.
In neither case is he lacking, iu
courtesy, if the matter is viewed
from his standpoint. But unless
the professors keep in mind the
shortness of time between bells,
they surely must be constrained to
think that the manners of the days
of '49 are yet prevalent on the coast.
