The history of the Stanford Press
Cub is anything but a creditable
one to the organization itself, or to
the individuals who compose it.
With one live meeting, at which
three interesting addresses were
made by members ot the faculty who
were more or less interested in jour
nalistic work, the Stanford Press
Club may be said to have outlived
its usefulness. The drones who now
manage its affairs do not show
enough spirit to even attempt the
development of a field in college life
which is by far the most fertile for
the work in hand and far reaching
in its results. Hut they alone are
not to blame. The members them
selves, by remaining inactive when
they have prescribed a seclusive
membership regulation, are not only
depriving themselves of the bene
fits which should be derived from
such an association, but usurp the
rights of others to form a similar or
ganization.
For two months officers have been

nominated for the enduing semester, |
but it lias been found impossible to
secure a quorum for an election. In
such u case stagnancy has become
an incurable disease, and the sooner
the present useless aggregation of
embryo journalists scatters to the
four winds of our California heavens |
the better it will be for those who
are earnestly seeking admittance
into the journalistic world as a pro
fession. Although we are situated
near a large city which is the high
way by which noted journalists fre
quently pai-s to and from the Orient,
none of these ever appear before
Stanford audiences. Julian llalph,
Villiers, and Creelman, all noted
war correspondents, visited San
Francisco last month, and a mere
invitation from the Press Club to
ppeak here would have availed j
where otherwise a heavy money con
sideration would have been neces-,
aary.
