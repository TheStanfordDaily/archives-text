In many ways track and field ath
letics are receiving their proper at
tention at Stanford. We have much
to encourage us, much to hope for
in the future. We have several star
men, much good material, an un
equalled track almost completed,
and a trainer. Earnest, systematic
trainiug methods are bting pursued
and the effect produced is marked
even now.
There is one way, however, in
which too little effort is being made
to advance our interests iu this field
of athletics. Not enough pressure
is brought to bear upon the men
who are capable and >et are not
training. Four times as many men
should be out There are dozens of
men in this University who should
be receiving the benefit of the pres
ent intelligent coaching. Every
mau of known ability in athletics
should be induced to go into train
ing, and some means bhould be de
vised to discover those who have
ability and do not know it or do net
care to let others know it.
