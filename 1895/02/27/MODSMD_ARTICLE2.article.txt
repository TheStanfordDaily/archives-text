# An Expert's View of Berkeley's Chances in the East.
## 
### 
We quote below the larger part of an
interview with .John Elliott, ex-handi
eapper of the Olympic Club, which ap
peared in yesterday's Cull. Mr. El
liott in thoroughly posted on athletics,
and is well known among the amateurs
of the coast. His opinion on the
rhances of Berkeley's team in the East
carries the weight of authority.
1 fear the university boys, who are
n.iw in training on the Berkeley cam
pus, will stand a very poor chance of
achieving any great honor in the East
should the team participate in the inter
collegiate championships. 1 am satis
fied that Yale, Harvard, and Princeton
athletes cau easily vanquish the Caliibr
nians in Geld and track events, and so
far as the Pennsylvania college athletes
arc concerned the Berkeley l>o)s will
certainly meet with a setback unless
their captain has had an understanding
with the captain of the I'ennsylvanians

that only ten or twelve men on each
side shall compete for whatever honor
and glory is at stake.
I would like to see some of the Stan
ford University men among the team
that will go East to represent Califor
nia in the intercollegiate contests, but
as the University of California is de
termined to go it alone this time, 1 very
much doubt if it will return with the
praises that follow successful com
petition.
The Berkeley athletes are certainly
deserving of unstinted praise for what
they have accomplished with a view of
stirring up an athletic rivalry between
the universities of the East and West.
Excellent as an idea of this kind cer
tainly is, I am of the opiuion that a
team of amateur athletes representing
this State should be pretty near first
class, as California will certainly be
judged—that is athletically speaking—
by the good or poor performances of its
athletes on their first, appearance in au
intercollegiate contest on the other side
of the mountains.
If, as 1 said before, an agreement
had been made between the captains of
the teams representing the universities
of Pennsylvania and California as to
the number of men who will compete in
athletic rivalry, then we could confi
dently look forward to a good race be
tween the East and West. If such an
understanding has not resulted, I can
not imagine how the Berkeley boys can
hope to win against a college team that
nay outnumber its opponents two to
one.
Now that it is an assured fact that a
team from the University of California
will journey eastward in a few months I
would suggest that a good trainer heap
pointed to look after the athletes and
have theui in first-class condition when
they will leave for the East. Captain
Koch is undoubtedly a good man in
some particulars, hut there are many
little things in the way of athletic train
ing he has yet to learn.
Athletes require as much attention
as racehorses, and unless each man has
had careful handling in bis preparatory
training the team will certainly go to
pieces at a time when it is expected to
do good service.
In the games held last, Friday I find
that, Stanford had more wins to her
credit than Berkeley although the lat
ter had more of its representatives iu
the competitions. I am very anxious
io see Scroggins in good condition,
lie has been credited with doing even
time for the hundred yards on the
Berkeley campus. I will be glad to
see him repeat this performance at the
intercollegiate field-day, which will he
the event of the season iu amateur ath
letics on this coast.
