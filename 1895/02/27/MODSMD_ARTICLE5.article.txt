# Freshman Meeting.
## 
### 
The Class of'9B held an enthusiastic
but very slightly atteuded meetiug in
the chapel this afternoon. A motion
that the class supply baseball suits for
the Freshman team was lost, but an as
sessment ot twenty-five cents was
ordered to help defray the other ex
penses connected with baseball. A
committee consisting of W. C. McNeil,
chairman; L. 11. Steinhart, F. A.
Schneider, Miss Wehner, and Miss
liobertson was appointed to consider the
advisability of giving a Freshman en
tertainment this semester.
