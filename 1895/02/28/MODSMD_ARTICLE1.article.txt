# The 						Freshmen Win Easily.
## 
### 
Yesterday's game between '9G and
'98 ended in a howling tarce. The
Freshmen put up a splendid game of
which Cope's all-round playing was
one of the principal features. *96
played a lifeless game, and could do
nothing with the stick. The contest
was not begun till nearly 5 o'clock, and
in the fourth inning the Juniors began
trying to delay the game hoping to
force the umpire to call it on account of
darkness. The umpire could not see
it. that way, however, and declared the
game forfeited to '98 by the score of
9to 0. Here are the details:
