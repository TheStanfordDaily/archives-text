The combination of a mandolin
club of one university with the glee
club of another is certainly a novel
idea. It is doubtful if such an ar
rangement would be possible among
the institutions of the East, where a
certain feeling ot'conservatism would
probably prevent the entertaining of
such a proposition. Stanford and
Berkeley, however, have not fol
lowed closely the liues laid down by
older institutions, aud what would
be possible and desirable with us
might not at all be considered the
proper thing in the effete East.
The combination which has recently
beeu effected between our Mandolin
Club and Berkeley's Glee Club, will
doubtless prove a good thing for
both universities. While it will
bring them into friendly aud har
monious relations, there will be a
pleasant spirit of rivalry between the
clubs which will give zest to the con
certs. Both clubs are to be congrat
ulated upon the combination.
