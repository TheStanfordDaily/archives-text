When the University opened last
September our football propects
were anything but encouraging.
There was a scarcity of new material,
ami many of the old players whom
we had come to regard as indispens
able, announced that the pressure of
I 'niversity work would not allow them
to play. In t>pite of these discourage
ments, there was more interest man
ifested in the game than has been
exhibited during any previous year
of the University's existence The
result of this interest and enthusi
asm, together with the hard work of
the captain, coach, and the players
themselves, gained for us a victory
that will always be an iucentive to
future effort. The striking lesson
glined from this experience is par

ticularly applicable now. We are
faced with the same conditions in
baseball, and. as far as interest goes,
witli the same conditions in track
athletics, as those which confronted
us in football. The class games have
brought interest in baseball to a
high | itch, aud interest in track ath
letics was never greater. But inter
est alone did not bring us victory in
football, and it will not bring us vic
tory in baseball and track athletics.
It took the hardest kind of work to
put our team in the splendid form
that gave such a satisfying result on
Thanksgiving day. The lesson must
be applied to baseball and track ath
letics. The football men who have
been holding back, and men who
feel that they have any ability in
athletics, should feel duty-bound to
present themselves for training each
day. Let the men do their part,
and interest and encouragement bj
the student body will do the rest.
