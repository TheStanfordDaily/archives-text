### 
The lecture on the Kltuira (N. Y.)
Reformatory given this morning by
Prof. Mary Roberts Smith before the
class in Kihics 12 was a rare treat.
The lecturer showed a thorough knowl
edge of her subject, having visited the
place for the purpose of making a study
of the institution. The substance of
I he lecture is as follows:
Heretofore there have been two ideas
in regard to the management of the crim
inal class; first, the retribution or Mosaic
idea, and second, the protection idea,
which maintains that society has a right
to protect itself against t hose members
who will not conform to its code. This
principle is applied to the insane, lepers,
paupers, etc
There has been no study of the crim
inal nature until very Tecent times.
Many attempts have been made to save
the criminal's soul by appealing to his
emotional nature, and to mitigate his
lot by sentimental attentions. There
was no recognition, however, that any
remedy must go as deep and be as
severe as the disease it is to cure. Our
treatment of criminals has been of the
mediaeval school of medicine—the ho
meopathic principle that " like cures
like." Retribution is still at the basis
of our prison management, and protec
tion is its excuse.
The philosophy of the Klmira sys
'< m if that the olject of society i* not

retribution, but simply protection. This
is to be brought about either by reform
ing the man, or, providing that he can
not be reformed, justifying for his re
moval from society. It says to the
criminal, "Work out your own salva
tion," and helps (a) by providing mo
tives for right doing, as for instance, in
shortening the sentence; in promotion
for good work and conduct, in develop
ment of self respect by becoming the
equal of the-officers aud attaining privi
leges; (b) by establishing right habits
of mind and body, so that right doing
becomes easier; (c) by teaching that
honesty, industry, aud knowledge
vs. "The way of the transgressor is
hard"; (d) by teaching that satisfaction,
contentment, relf respect, is the normal
condition n life.
This institution was organized by a
special law of New York State in 1876,
under the government of a board of
managers chosen by the Covernor.
£2,000,000 has been spent, on it since
its foundation. "The distinctive aim
of the Reformatory is to discharge its
inmates at the earliest date at which
they will be likely to obey the laws
ami honorably earn their own subsist
ence" ; "to transfer them from the
predatory to the productive class " Mr.
Brockway, the manager of the institu
tion, believes that'it is only justice to
reform the criminal, and that society is
partly responsible for the evil against
which it legislates to guard itself. So
ciety lias prenatal duties toward all its
future members. The criminal off
spring is not rarely a victim of the na
tion's neglect of the criminal parent.
"Much is said of social defense, as if
society alone could be attacked, while
not infrequently it is society which at
tacks and the individual who is obliged
to defend himself."
The methods used aim to make the
life of the criminal approach that of the
free citizen as nearly as possible; to
cultivate the same habits, appeal to the
same motives, awaken in him the same
ambitions. A man's behavior deter
mines his senteuce or parole. His oc
cupation is a means of livlihood and a
source of revenue at the same time.
The education of the inmates is cared
for in trades-schools, and in the school
of letters. There are classes in prac
tical morality, music, and religion.
His physical renovation is cared for in
the gymnasium and by military train
ing.
The class of men sent there are
between sixteen and thirty years of aire,
atid the majority are from New York
City, sentenced from the Court of Gen
eral sessions for state prison offenses.
The men are put to work at product
ive industries, and work six hours a day.
I The simplest industries in which they
| are engaged arc umbrella and cabinet
making, foundry work, tailoring, and
cane seating. The men receive ten
per cent, of the gross earnings, the rate
of wages being 55, 45, and 85 cents
per day. The cost of living varies
from 4" to 25 cents per day. The

most that a man can hope to save up
during his sentence is not over 820.00.
The theory under which the trades
schools are conducted is that "Most
men who lie or cheat or steal do eo be
cause they are in some way too weak to
do better. What others gain by hon
est, intelligent industry, they seek by
dishonest schemes because they are too
weak and witless to follow truth and
honesty. Men cannot, in these days,
especially in this country, be indus- j
trially strong or even industrially free
without education. Knowledge, which
used to be a power, is now a common
necessity. For every man extricated
by training from the mass of uuskilled, j
unemployed labor, diminishes the com
petition there, and helps to supply the I
demand that still exists for skilled labor
in the higher field."
The school of letters is composed of
a kindergarten, grammar grade, and
academic grade, special emphasis being
laid on moral philosophy, ethics, aud
economics in the academic grade.
There is a library as a supplement to
the educational methods, and it is a
curious fact the following books are the
most popular with the inmates: Les
Miserables, Looking Backward, Oliver
Twist, Auam Bede, Scarlet Letter
Ivanhoe, Torn Brown's School Days,
Robert Klsmere, Arabian Nights, and
The Last Days of Pompeii. The in
mates issue a journal which gives practice
in stenography, reporting, and printing.
The object of the physical training
department is the improvement of the
mental and moral capacity by means of
physical cxercise, baths, improved food
and sleep, and even a change of clothes.
The theory is that abnormal mental
conditions are the result of an abnormal
physical condition. The system accord
ingly attempts (a) 'to counteract, the
enervatisin of enforced idleness (jails);
(7>) to build up the body for future
activities; (*•) to 'quicken arrested de
velopment by exercise and grooming;
(d) to supplement the hospital in re
storing patients to health.
The objects of military training are
the same as those of the gymnasium
The results are a good physical bear
ing, alertness, mental quickming, co
ordination of powers, attention, concen
tration, moral order, obedience, and
duty. Promotion and distinction are
the incentives.
The result of the whole system is
that it concentrates all the experiences
of a lifetime into a few years, and teaches
the inmates laws and their conse
quences. To give these degenerate of
the race a task, to teach them to re
spect it and themselves, to develop the
body and quicken the mind, is the aim
of the best modern penology. It may
| be that the "time will come when ev
| cry punitive institution in the civilized
world will be destroyed, and all places
for the treatment of crime will be hos
pitals, schools, work-shops, and reform
' atories."
