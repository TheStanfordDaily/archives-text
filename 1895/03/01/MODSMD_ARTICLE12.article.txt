To Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
An editorial appeared in today's <S>
quoia which stauds in need of consider
able correction.
The statement is made that the only
expense connected with these inter-class
contests is the purchase of balls by the
class treasuries. In order to indue*
men to come out the management of
fered ten sweaters to the winning team
at a cost of $35.00, and furnishes bats
and other paraphernalia besides, at a
total cost of $50.00. Scasou tickets for
eight games are fifty cents, and a single
admission of twenty-five cents is charged
to force the sale of season tickets, no
charge being made to ladies, with the
hope that this additional expense could
be covered. Up to date —and the re
ceipts are practically ended—not enough
has been received to cover this expense.
In addition the article states that the
receipts from outside games have al
ways been sufficient to meet the obliga
tions of the baseball managements. In
'92 the management lost $200; in *93
$234 of unpaid bills were left; in '94
the Student Body was plunged into
debt $212 further.
The amount taken from class treas
uries for balls does not exceed $5, so
that not a great number of men have
been ever burdened with assessments.
The statement is also made that no
charge has been made before for inter
class contests; but football seems to
have been overlooked. Even if no
charge had been made, it does not es
tablish the precedent that the preseut
management should not try to conduct
the season without throwing the associ
ation further in debt. In the end the
Student Body pays for the games, and
it is surely more just that those who
enjoy them should pay the greater
share.
Among the benefits from the arrange
ment it might be mentioned that by offer
ing a prize, a series of eight games has
been made possible, whereas heretofore
only three games were played.
Respectfully, 11. 0. Hoovkr.
