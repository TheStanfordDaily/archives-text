Stanford University is supposed
to be an objective point ot't'ie Wells,
Fargo Express Coinp iny. Packages
ate addressed to and sent out from
Stanford University, and money
orders are made payable at this
point. All this would tend to show

Hint we are not a mere adjunct of the
iMeulo Park office, but that the man
agers of the express company believe
that we should have the same piiv
ileges as are a Horded that office or
Palo Alto.
Hut we do not receive the priv
ileges of a fully established office.
Every University package is dropped
off at Menlo Park and an additional
charge of from ten cents to half a
dollar is made for its transfer to the
campus, whether the regular charges
are prepaid or not.
Such discrimination has been
practiced for three years, the same
fault remaining after the establish
ment of a campus office. It may be
the fault of the company itself or its
local representatives. The only way
to avoid the difficulty is to refuse to
pay this unjust account; such a
stand has been taken by customers
here and has been allowed. If
more object to the extra tax it will
soon be a thing of the past.
