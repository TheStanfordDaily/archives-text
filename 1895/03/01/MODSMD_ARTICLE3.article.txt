# New Baseball Suits.
## 
### 
At the request of Manager Z ; on,
President llinsdill received the follow
ing bids for baseball suits (shirts and
pants): ft. T. A lien, 54.85; Clabrough,
Golcher A: Co ,$4 25; Nolan, $8 25.
Overman Co., 50; .J. J. I 'lister,
$4. The la>t named tirin was awarded
the contract, their cloth being superior
to Nolan's and equal to any of the
others. It is hoped that this method ol
awarding contracts will set a precedent
which in the future will dispel any
rumors of managers dividing commis
sions with dealers.
The suits selected are light gray,with
the name on the chest in cardinal, the
lettering being very similar to that on
the old suits. The caps will be of the
same color as the shirts, with four-inch
visors attached. Black stockings and
leather belts will be the further changes
from last year's uniform.
