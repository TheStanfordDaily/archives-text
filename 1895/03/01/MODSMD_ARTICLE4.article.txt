# Varsity Baseball Practice.
## 
### 
Last evening the following candidates
for the Varsity baseball team came out
for practice: Sheehan, Baker, Cal
houn, Pincus, Young, Joyce, Harrel
son, White, Johnston, Thompson, Rus
sell, and Klauber. Captain J)yer is
quick to find the weak points of his
men, and is energetically striving to rem
edy their defects. The greatest weak
ness at present seems to he in the bat
ting, and in this there is much room
for improvement. It is true we have a
few meu who may hold their own as far
as batting is concerned with any of
the players on the coast, but on the
whole the batting is very poor, and too
much practice at the bat is impossible.
The fielders are generally strong and

arc doing excellent work. The candi
dates are so nearly on au equal that the
captain will probably find difficulty in
making selections. The bases are not
so strong, still the men trying for these
positions are doing well and a slight
improvement is being manifested.
There are but two more regular prac
tices before the Varsity will contest
with the Olympics, and the men should
avail themselves of etery opportunity
for improvement. We must not lose the
first game.
