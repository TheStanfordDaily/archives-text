### 
The Woman's Athletic Association
met at the Kobe gymnasium this after
hood. It is a very creditable organiza
tion, and is as well systematized as any
association in the University. The
men have nothing exactly correspond
ing to it, although, in the nature of
things, their athletics are brought he
tore the public to a greater extent.
The Association is divided into four
branches: Basket-Hall, Archery, Bi
cycling, and Tenuis. Kach of three,
has its own club, which is under direct
supervision of the Athletic Hoard, but
has its own officers.
The young ladies have done very
work in basket-ball, have had one
excellent tennis tournament, have taken
several tifteeo-mile rides by moonlight
and otherwise on their weeels, and are
acquiring a high degree of proficiency
in archery.
