# "The Healing of the Nations."

llov. A. 11. Smith delivered the ser
mon in the chapel Sunday. His sub
ject was ''The Healing of the Nations;"
his text, Bev. xxii , 2.
This book called the Bible is a li
brary written by many men during
many aires and yet there is an unexplic
abie unity in it. It, begins with the
creation and ends with a creation—the
new creation. The tilings that ap
peared in the beginning appear again
in the end. There is the garden, the
tree of life, and the river of life. They
are lost by the genesis of sin and we do
not meet them again until we couie to
the end and then we see the beautiful
unity. The serpent reappears at the
close but is thrown into a pit. And
the curse that was once pronounced, is
withdrawn. It is a story of paradise
l »stand paradise regained.
In the garden there was a tree of life
' and the leaves of the tree were for the
healing of the nations." The inquiry
must present itself to every man, iJo the
nations need any healing? Go into any
part of the world and you will find that
they have their crises They have in
ternal disorders of some kind, about
party, labor and capital, or some other
thing. Fiance has been a monarchy;
it is today a republic. What will it be
tomorrow? In Austria the oldest house
is uncertain of succession. In Runs a
is there nothing that needs healing?
Is anything the matter with .Japan and
China today? What is the matter with
the world? Unquestionably it needs
moral healing.
Moral healing is not accomplished by
civilization. K iviiiz.ition is overcoming
nature and making her serve your pur
ples. I'eople are in the habit of wor
shipping civilization. They think if
they have that, all the rest will follow.
But this is not so. Egypt, China,
(J recce, and Babylonia were civilized
and they all fell. The trouble is we
take causes for effects. There is nothing
morally elevating iti the fact that we
have overcome nature —that we are civ
ilized.
We live in an age of world-wide com
munication . Some people say that com
merce is a remedy for the ills of society.
It, is a good thing and a neccssarv
thing, but it will not cure the disorder
of society. The Phoenicians were the
greatest commercial nation of the earth.
The Jews got their ideas of trading lrom
the Phoenicians. They were not trad
( rs originally. But they could see God
at the same time and the Phoenicians
could not. These nations fell. What
was the matter ? There was no moral
quality in commerce, and there was
even an immoral (juality. Goto Africa
where the slave trade was introduced by
the Mohammedans and is still kept up.
It prevents all law and order in the
c untry. Consider the East India mo
nopoly. England had no firm hold on
India till that was abolished. It op
posed missionaries because their doc
trines would be detriments' to its course.
And this was all tolerated and even

carried on by Christians.
Some men say we need the gospel of
culture. Culture is power. When we
all know everything and have all our
talents in lull operation, we will be cul
tured, I suppose. The most cultured
people that ever existed or probably
ever will exist were the Greeks. It
has been said that the Greeks were as
far above the Auglo-Saxons as the
Anglo-Saxons are above the South Sea
Islanders in capacity. It was an age
of culture. Vet the women were not
educated. The model of culture is, "I
rather than you." It a man of culture
knows ten languages, will ho give you
five? Culture begins with and termi
nates on self. Sci 11 this culture—all
literature, sculpture, drawing, and art,
originated in religion. It was the
work of the gods. They began with
morality. But there is nothing directly
moral in culture itself.
Another remedy is to teach people
morality and thus raise them up. But
standards differ. What is right at one
time is wrong at another. Morals by
themselves mean nothing. In China
they have a ''supetior man" who is sup
posed to live up to the religion of Con
fucius. But if you go there and ask
about him, they will tell you he is ex
tinct. That is the trouble with the
superior man. Do you remember the
dny you learned the ten commandments?
Was it the happiest day of your life?
You got more morality and in a bigger
dose than ever before, probably. That
was morality as a system.
The only remedy is the Gospel. This
Gospel is for everybody; and we have
more of a duty to perform now than
ever; for our obligations are in propor
tion to our advantages. It does not
matter how small or how expansive
your abilities are, there is always work
to do. There is evangelistic, educa
tional, or medical work. And no one
need be idle while the world needs
healing. If a man would be noble, let
him full on his knees as Paul did and
say, ' Lord, what wilt Thou have me to
do ?"
