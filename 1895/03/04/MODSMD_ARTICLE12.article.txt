One of the obstacles with which
the management of the '96 Annual
has had to contend has been the dif
ticulty of getting information. Cer
tain persons who have been ap
pointed to gather important statistics
are greatly hindering the work by
their delay. This has been a source
of annoyance to the editors, and is
likely to delay the appearance of the
Annual.
A creditable showing in this re
spect does not concern the Class of
'96 alone; a good annual is a matter
of pride to the whole University, and
as such demands the co-operation of
all classes.
