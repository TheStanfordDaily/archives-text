Friday night's contest gave ad
ditional proof of Stanford's excel
lence in debate. All the speakers
did well; any one of them might
have stood to represent the Univer
sity with credit The three who will
champion the cardinal were chosen
with some difficulty, and tue deci
sion, clone as it was, was accepted as
coriect by the audience.
It is of the greatest importance
for us to make a good showing
against Berkeley next month. In
time the international character of
the contest, its relation to similar
attains in other colleges, and the fact
that there is a permanent trophy
connected with it, are destintd to
make the (Jarnut Medal debate; a \ery
important intercollegiate event.
There is something also beyond
all this to give the contest import
ance â€”its object. We Americans
know too little of that grand and
powerful nation of the old world
which is working out the problems
of government on the same lines as
ourselves. The primary object of
M. Coubertin in establishing these
prizes was to create in the intel
lectual classes of America a sym
pathy for the institutions of France.
Our representatives then have a
two fold responsibility; lirst, to
champion alma mater, and second,
to assist in the great work of bring
ing closer in knowledge the two
great republics of America and
Europe.
