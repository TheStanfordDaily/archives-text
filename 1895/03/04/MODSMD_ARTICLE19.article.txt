### 
In an extract from the bulletin of!
the U. S. Fish Commission is an article
entitled "Notes on the Fresh-Water
Species of San Luis Obispo County,
California," by David Starr Jordan.
According to this report there are only
seven species found there, and in no
other streams of the United States in
which an equal amount ot water flows
has so short a list been recorded. This
is due to the fact that fresh-water fishes
cannot reach San Luis Obispo from
other streams except by descent to the'
sea, because the streams of San Luis
Obispo form no part of any of the great
valley systems, but are short, and empty
directly into the sea.
