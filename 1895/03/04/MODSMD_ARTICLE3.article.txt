The members of the Phi Kappa Psi
fraternity received a telegram yesterday
morning from Bloomington, Indiana,
announcing the death of W. I'. Chaui
berlin on Thursday. They received a
letter dated February 25th, saying that
Mr. Chamberlin was very ill, having
contracted a cold four weeks ago which
settled on his lungs and later developed
into the grippe, which has been preva
lent at Bloomington. lie did not call
in a physician, however, thinking he
would get better, but pneumonia set in,
and that, aggravated by peritonitis,
proved fatal.
Mr. Chamberlin was an instructor in
English at the University of Indiana.
He received his A. B. last Christmas,
and along with his classes was doing
post-graduate work.
While a student here he whs re
garded as a man of clear judgment and
recognized ability. Fora term he was
editor-in-chief of the Sequoia, and was
first elected editor-in-chief of the '95
Annual, which position he resigned soon
after his election. While here he be
gan to do review work for the Critic
and this ho kept up until recently.
He was connected with the Outiny
magazine at one time.
Although not many knew him in
timately, those who did are full of re
gret at his death. His prospects were
very bright; he was well liked at
Bloomington, and his death is untimely
in every sense of the word.
