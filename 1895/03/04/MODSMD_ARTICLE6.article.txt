'96 Out Tor the Sweaters —The Pioneers
Win Another Game-
Saturday's game between '1)5 and '90
was the first to be played on the new
grounds. For six innings it looked
like a sure tiling for '95, but '96 took
u brace and for the last three innings
the game was the most exciting of the
series yet played. Ilea was knocked
out of the box in the seventh. White
then started in to pitch but lasted only
half an inning and llarrelson pitched
out the game. The Juniors had the
game tied in the eighth but threw it
away again by ragged outtielding in the
ninth. In their half of the ninth the
Juniors got a man to third base but lie
failed to score.
Kuddell pitched a good game and
would have won the game if he had
been properly supported. The fielding
of '9G was very poor and the team owes
its thirteen runs t more to good "root
ing" by the crowd on the bleachers
than to good playing. The new grounds
seem favorable to long hits and the
spectators will probably see a good deal
of this kind of batting in the coming
games. The score:
