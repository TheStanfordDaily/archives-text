# The 						Hazing Fraternity at Berkeley.
## 
### 
The Call in an article this morning
says that certain men in Berkeley have
received a charter froui the Thetu Nu
Kpsilon hazing fraternity, and had
given notice that the first initiation of
seventeen new members will he made
Friday night. Soue twelve years aj.o
the same "Irat" was orgauized at the
U. C. hut its practices brought it into
collision with the faculty and the ''Irat''
was literally wiped out of existence by
the severity of the faculty. Interest is
rife uow as to what the faculty will do
with the revived organization.
