The baseball game last Saturday
showed that our new diamond, with
a given amount of labor expended
upon it, should make a hue ground.
No time, however, should be lost in
having every hollow filled up, and
the whole field should be thoroughly
rolled immediately. Several costly
errors can be credited to the rough
ness of the outfield, and no man can
be expected to do his best work ou a
field where the slightest iuattention
might result in a sprained ankle.
