The knowledge that the renowned
xctor, Frederick Warde, is to give a
recital before the students of this in*
stitution to assist the fund for secur.
ind a skilled track coach, is one more
proof uf the generosity of this man.
Time and again has Warde con
sented to do little acts of liberality
and courtesy throughout the country
that have done much to add to his
great popularity.
The famous tragedian's lecitals
are as fascinating as his representa
tions on the stage that have won his

laurels The marvellous pitch of
intensity to which a spectator can be
wrought up by witnessing a scene pre
sented by Warde, even though un
assisted by any of the necessary ac
coutrements that emphas'ze the ef
fect of the same scene on the stage,
is inexpressible. No one should
miss attending this treat of the sea
son, for lie thus deprives himself of
an invaluable pleasure and with
holds needed assistance from the
track management in their efforts to
wards tecuring a trainer for the field
men.
