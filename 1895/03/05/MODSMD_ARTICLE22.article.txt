# Valuable Addition to the Library.

### 
Among the recent additions to the
library is a curious volume entitled
'â€¢Science Notes," which was presented
to the University by its author, Dr.
J. K. Fraser of Edinburgh University,
through Dr. Jordan during the latter's
absence in Mexico. The volume con
sists of newspaper clippings, original
documents and letters, and other data
relating to various scientific questions.
This token of respect from a veteran
university ot the old world is peculiarly
valuable on account of the prominence
of the learned professor who compiled
it and presented it to the University.
