### 
Last evening the following athletes
came out: Sprints —Copeland, Kash,
Carter, Bernhard, Geo. Hazzard,
Knowles, 1). Brown, Toombs, and
Woodward. Hurdles—Simpson High
jump—Toombs. Hammer — \Y atsou.
There has been a deeided improve
ment over the past two weeks among
the men who are working earnestly and
following the instructions of Trainer
Hunter. Most of the men seem to
realize the responsibility that rests upon
them of giving the University more
glory in track events than has yet ever
fallen to it. Our standing with Berke
ley in track events is decidedly lower
than it should be, but since real inter
est and earnest work has at last mani
fested itself, there is hope of a far
better showing henceforth. Such over
whelming victories for Berkeley arc
events of the past.
