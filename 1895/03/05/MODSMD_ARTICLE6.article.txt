Editor Daily 1\alo Alto:
It is frequently remarked by casual
visitors to the campus that one dis
agreeable feature of our location is the
dust. Just now this criticism cannot
be denied, and residents ou the campus
are beginning to wonder what has be
come of the spriukling cart.
With such weather as we had during
December and January artificial sprink
liug was undoubtedly at a discount, but
since the danger now is rather suffoca
tion from dust than drowning, our ills
might be alleviated by working the
sprinkler with a reasonable degree of
diligence. It will seem like reckless
prodigality to waste filtered water on
our streets, and as the filter will soon be
in operation, we may a* well give the
roads a good wettiug down with some
of the liquid now in the pipes.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The number of residents now in En
cina is at an unusually low mark and
furnishes material for some hard think
ing. Why is it that with such finely
lighted, heated, and ventilated rooms,
so conveniently situated, there are so
few boarders and lodgers:? The main
reason is that the room rent is too
high. Some arrangement should be
made so that the total charge for board
and lodging would be but $20. At this
rate the hall could be easily filled and a
much larger income obtained at an ex
pense proportionately less than at pres
ent. Unless some such rate is adopted
and with the new system of allowing
lodgers to board where they see fir, the
hall is likely to become an aching void
and that at no distant day. F. M.
