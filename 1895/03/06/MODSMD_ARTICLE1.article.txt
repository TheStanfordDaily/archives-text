Prof. Woodruffs Lecture Last Night in
the Chapel.
Prof. Woodruff delivered a very in
teresting lecture last night in thechapel,
the room being tilled to the doors to
hear him. He had spent three months
in Egypt in 1891, when he had access
to manuscripts and official documents
from which he gathered the material
for his lecture. The lecture was pre
faced by a spicy description of the voy
age which he made on the Mediter
ranean Sea. In substance the speaker
said:
In the valley of the Nile today, there
are three Eg) pts 'I here are the sub
stratum dominions of the Egypt Ex
ploration Fund —an ancient land of
sphinx, pyramid, mummy, and scarab,
niled over in this century by a dynasty
of archaeologists—by Mariette, Maspero,
Brugsch, and now under the sw;iy of
I'etrie. Superimposed, is the Egypt of
Mohammed — of taperiug minarets,
swelling domes, and dusk) bazaars, of
all the torpifyiug influences focalized at
Cairo in the teachings of the great. uni
versity-mosque of Al-Ahzar with its
nineteen thousand students swaying and
muttering over the Koran. Above this,in
turn, is the Egypt of English occupa
tion, a field of diplomatic disputes for
European powers. From this last
Egypt proceed the cable dispatches that
revive intermittently what is called the
' Egyptian question."
England of course is known to be the
L'teitest <'l colonizers and the most suc
cessful governor of orientals, but the re
forms she has wrought in Egypt dur
ing the past nine years are little lessthau
phenomenal A looted treasury, a dis
organized and almost hopelessly corrupt
administration, a rebellious and cow
;irdly army, and a people crushed under
u bearable taxation, have in this short
space of time and in the face of oriental
apathy and French obstruction been
metamorphosed into order, plenty, aud
content. This work of the English in
Egypt is an achievement of which
Anglo Saxons must be proud.
The history of Egypt since 1862 has
been the history ot the Egytian debt,
of its usurious growth to gigantic pro
portions, and of the recent marvellous
re-establish ment, of the country's finan
cial credit. The complications of con
temporary Egyptian history may be
said to begin with the loans of 1802,
contracted by Said, Istnd.'s predeces
sor, to meet engagements with the Suez
('anal Company.
The nominal amount of these two
loans was C3,293,000 issued at 87 1-2
and 01 1-2 respectively. Of this loan
only £2,640,000 reached the treasury.
Ismail, upon his succcssion in 1863,
began a career of criminal prodigality
which ceased only on his forced abdica
tion in 1879. One can scarcely de
scribe the pitiful condition of the fella
hcen upon whom the crushing burden
was 1st ill
At lasr, in March, 1878, the British

government formally committed itself
to the cause of the bondholders and
forced Ismail to appoint a commission
ot six Europeans (including the four
Commissioners of the Public Debt) j
with lull power to enquire into "the
whole financial situation of Egypt." As!
a result the Khedive was compelled to
surrender all his personal estates to the
State and appoint a respousible min
istry, practically European, to advise
him.
This new European ministry excited
the antagonism of the native.-, and Is
mail is suspected ol having encouraged
the popular resentment. At an) rate,
upon the strength of this feeling he
dismissed the cabinet and the Dual
Control was abolished. England then
compromised with him but insisted
that the two European ministers should
have an absolute power of veto. Ap
plication was made to Turkey for the
removal of Ismail, and after being given
an opportunity to abdicate, he was dis
placed and the late Khedive Tuwtik
was nauiel his successor .June 20,1879
The Dual Control was re established.
A committee of foreign delegates was
appointed to formulate a law of liqui
dation and to so provide for the security
of debts that the financial engagements
of the country could not be broken with
out direct responsibility to the powers.
This readjustment of the debt and de
crease of the interest weut into effect in
July, 1880.
Meanwhile the natives were growing
more and more restless at the sight of
the foreigners Jasteued upon the public
offices, and murmured against the con
tinual extension of European influence.
Out of this discontent grew the revolt
of the army officers led by Arabi, who
was really patriotic but probably a tool
in the hands of conniving native poli
ticians who were longing fora return
of former days of recklessness. His
will was law fora few months, the re
volt finally culminating in the massacre
of Europeans at Alexandria in June,
1882. Hostile movements were then
made agaiust the Fiench and English
squadrons in the harbor, and the
French at this important juncture hav
ing, for some inscrutable reason, refused
to take action, the English alone bom.
barded the city, and this act with the
battle of Tel-el-Kebir which followed,
effected the present occupation of
Egypt by the English. The last sign
of any other foreign authority was
wiped out by the abolition of the re
stoied Dual ot Control, the English
member being made financial adviser to
the government. It is not (possible to
determine just how much Arabi was
quietly abetted by Turkey or France;
each of whom in return for inactiou
might have expected her own sole
supremacy in Egyptian affairs, but the
refusal of France to join in the supres
sion of Arabi is significant. What
ever the motive of France may have
been, the blunder of I)c Freycinet in
not directing the French squadron to
unite with the Engli.-h ships in the

bombardment of Alexandria resulted in
England's entering Egypt alone and
slamming the door in the face of her \
partner in the Dual Control.
lu former days a poor man was com
pletely at the mercy of his rich neigh-
of the corrupt native inspector,
who unless bribed would not open a
sluice at a critical time for the crops.
Now the poor uo longer have to bribe
for water; they have confidence in the I
English inspectors and have learned j
that petitions will be listened to and
wrongs redressed.
The greatest social reform carried i
out by the English is one connected
with the aunual clearing of these ca
nals from silt. From immemorial
times public works had depended fir
their execution upon forced, uupaid la
bor, aud this system was the core if
most of the official corruption.
In the civil service too reforms were
immediately set on foot.
In 1890 there was a reduction of fifty
per cent, in ttie rates ot internal letter
postage. The railway service has been
improved, trains now run oil time, and
the number of passengers carried in
1889 was over a milliou more than in
1880.
'J he police, at present numbering
about 70U0 men, were formerly undisci
plined and subject to the provincial
governors; but the body has beeu put
uuder English officers, completely re
organized, aud is subject to proper dis
cipline.
in 1887 there were ouly twelve
schools under the ministry of public in
struction, with an attendance of 1919, of
whom ouly fifty per cent, were paying
pupils, Three years later the number
of scht cb »ud pupils had quadrupled.
This is more noteworthy because edu
cation is ( not compulsory.
The most recent reforms have been
concerned with the judiciary, Justice
Scott, a judge with experience in India,
having last year been appointed judicial
adviser to the government, with the
usual accompanimcut of au ineffectual
French protest. This appointment
meaus English inspection of the native
courts; the facilitation of justice to liti
gants; a reduction of the opportunities
for influencing the decisions of the nat
ive judges; and the prevention of inter
ference on the part of higher native of
ficials connected with the executive de
partment of the government, an inter
ference that has beeu recognized as
existing. Last year soou after the es
tablishment of the new courts of sum
mary jurisdiction as a part of this re
form in upper Egypt, the business dis
posed of was five times that transacted
! uuder the old system.
This is in brief the story of how the
English came to occupy Egypt and what
they have doue there.
