Fon the I enetit <>112 the readers of
lie Daily I'alo Alto, it might be
well to stale why u detailed «eport
of the recent actiou of the Berkeley-
Stanford athletic committees husnot
been published. S< me time ago
fiese two committees met, in San
Francisco, each committee selecliug
it« own secretary. These secretaries
worked independently of each other
and, hs a result, the sections adopted

ta tlie conferetce were numbered in
aa irregular fashion. This is shown
by a comparison of tho accounts
published in the Berlc*Vycin and tbe
Daily Palo Alto. Wishing to take
further action on tbe rules thus
adopted, the two committees nut
again last Saturdiy. The Berkeley
secretary was on hand with his well
kept minutes, and as the Stanford
secretary bad left his minutes "down
at the hotel," the chaugeswere made
by referring to tbe tabulation of tie
Berkeley records. The Stanford
secretary took no regular minutes cf
this last important meeting, and
made his report orally to the Stan
ford Athletic Board last Monday
night. AVith no written minutes to
guide them, the board adopted tbe
regulations, which existed only in the
memory of the secretary of the
acting committee.
Such unbusinesslike methods of
making intercollegiate agreements
which shall bind us for years to come
are to be heartily condemned. The
Stanford Athletic Board has only a
transient recollection of what it has
done.and,consequently,it was impos
sible to secure the publication of an of
ficial agreement entered into by Stan
ford and tbe University of California.
