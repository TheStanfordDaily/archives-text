# Varsity Practice.
## 
### 
A large crowd turned out to witness
the Varsity practice on the new dia
mond last night. An unusually large
number of candidates for the team [ap
peared on the field, but the play was
characterized by a looseness which does
not bode any good for next Saturday's
game against the Olympic Club's crack
nine.
The work of the out field was very
good, the men playing well together on
long hits and ground "balls. The in
field played without any judgment
whatever, and fumbling with one or two
exceptions was the order of the day.
In the batting practice, the men
showed up very well for the first of the
season. Most of them hit the ball in
the eye, and kept up close to the plate.
The following were among the list of
candidates: Sheehan, Thompson, Ray,
Calhoun, Pincus, McLaine, Klauber,
Jeff, Campbell, Downing, Kennedy, and
Russell.
