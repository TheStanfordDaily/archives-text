Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
I wish to make known to the resi
dents on the campus that our present
water supply is derived irom the Felt
Lake reservoir, and owing to the box
flume supplying the reservoir from the
Los Traticos creek being replaced by
12-inch iron pipe, it becomes necessary
to carefully use the water in the lake at
present, as the source necessarily has to
be stopped until the above work is com
pleted; which, the elements permitting,
will occupy about two weeks. No
supply can be drawn from the Searsville
dam at present. E. C. Hodges.
