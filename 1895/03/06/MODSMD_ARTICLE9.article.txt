The proposition brought forward
by the athletes of the University of
Pennsylvania to the eft'ect that the
winners of the Mott Haven games
be sent to England to compete with
athletos from Oxfoid and Cambridge,
instead of any special college team
beius; sent, is by far the most satis
factory plan to the country at large.
Though we feel proud of the record
that Yale and Amherst made in Eng
land, we must rememoer that the
athletes and the musicians who went
to England were not broadly repre
sentative. On the other hand, if the
winners of the Mott Ilaven games
were sent to compete with the win
ners of the Oxford-Cambridge games,
the best American athletes would be
pitted against the best English, and
interest in both countries would be
much greater than if the athletes of
one college were sent. Eor these
reasons it is to be hoped that the
proposition will be adopted.
