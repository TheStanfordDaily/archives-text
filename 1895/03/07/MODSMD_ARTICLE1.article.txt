### 
The March number of the Annala i
of the American Academy of Politi-j
■cat and Social Science contains an ex
cellent article on the " Pacific Railway
Debts," by It. T. Golburn of Elisabeth,
New Jersey. It shows a clcar grasp of j
the whole situation, is admirable in I
tone and impartial in judgment; and '
anyone who wishes to get an intelligent j
understanding of the general problem
will do well to read the entire article.
The extracts given below indicate the
tenor of the article.

"The legal status of this debt is that
of a book account, the security for
which is. or rather was, a statutory
hen, on the aided portions of the road
mid the corresponding equipment.
Even if recourse to foreclosure could
fairly be claimed, or were sustained by
the higher courts it can readily be
shown to be a barren remedy. As a
punishment aimed at transgressors it
would miss the mark and injure only
innocent third parties who are already
sufficiently victims Kxcept for the
decorum and its terror to underlying
claims, the second mortgage theory
might as well be abandoned and all
thought of proceeding on that line "
•' The practical situation is rather
complicated than cleared bv the asser
tion of tins right of foreclosure. To
begin with, the prior liens, equal-in
;<mount to the face of the subsidy, must
be assumed, and either paid off or ex
tt-nded. Suppose they were to make
common cause with the stockholders,
and claim the road i'self, or demand
their money, they could, with the same
cash turn round and parallel every es
,-ential portion of aided road, and ally
themselves with branches and terminal
11tics on which the United States have
no lien. No one knows this advantage
better than the directors of these com
panies. Quite recently a new Pacific
line (the "ireat, Northern, the fifth on
United States territory) has been com
pleted to I'uget, Sound at a cost of one
third that of the original Union-Central
line. Furthermore, who are to be the
bidders at a sale, outside of the first
mortgage holders and the government?
Much as the managers of railways quar
rel among themselves tor a division of
freight money, there is too much esprit
<ht corps among them for any respons
ible company to appear as a competi
tive bidder. it would, moreover, be in
danger of speedy and condign punish
ment from the owners of these irrdis
pensible branches, feeders, terminal
f*a"ilities, and tributary ocean steam
lines. No one can afford to own the
piece of railroad across these dry deserts
and high mountains, and which does
not also have its own entrance to either
Council Bluffs, Kansas City, Denver, or
San Francisco. The nation is bound by
honor and contract to respect the claim
of outsiders to the extent of $'25,000
per mile for the eastern portion of the
main line, and about $35,000 per mile
for the western portion."
"Foreclosure is not only no legal so
lution, it is no practical solution. If
is the forerunner of mischief only. One
may have much sympathy with the
people of California, a hundred thous
and of whom petition to have the de
cision take this course. The evils they
so eloquently portray, however, are
those which other parts of the country
share with them to a greater or less ex
tent. They see other communities
enjoying the benefits of a sharp compe
tition in rail-carriage, in through

freights carried at bare train expenses,
while the burden of fixed charges and
admistration is left to be sustained by
local traffic; that is to say, a portion of
the traffic of railroads (like the business
of the postoffices, which tolerates no
competitor) is doue at less than the
service costs. It is deemed better to
have it and keep the larger force of
men and rolling-stock employed than to
lose it. The people of California would
like the government to provide them
With this cheap carriage for their in
terior freights on the same basis as the
overland business which they now en
joy to the full, since private capital is
unwilling to do so. The fares and
freights in California itself are not high
nor unreasonable, tried by any stand
ard. This is the same grievance
cropping up in a hundred other places,
which the interstate Commerce Com
mission was organized to grapple with,
but which it can do but little to allevi
ate.
The suggestion emanating from the
same Matt: that the Attoriiey-Ceneral
should bring suit against the original
directors of the railway companies, to
recover large sums wrongfully obtained,
is not a fortunate one As a means of
reimbursing these maturing claims, it is
inadequate. This course was, in lac',
tried years ago, as a sequel to the
Credit Mohi.ier scandal, before the
Circuit Court of llarttord, when the
court ruled that it was for the Union
Pacific stockholders, not the govern
ment, to move, as they were the part
ies wronged, if any. In like manner it
is the stockholders of the Central Pa
cific (now for the most part in Europe)
who are at liberty to bring suit, if any
body, for restitution of plunder, under
this exceptional California statute,
made to curb the dishonesty of miuing
company officials, but easily evaded as
to all. Will the stockholders do so?
No; for the reason that it would be
throwing away good money for bad; and
besides, they have to fear the possible
hostility of the same men, or their suc
cessors, intrenched in power, and able
to injure if dislodged. It is easy for
the essayist, the lawyer, or the legis
lator, unfamiliar with the mysteries of
Wall Street and railroad finance and
management, to make charges, frame
bills and indictments, but not so the
practical work of negotiation and re
dress."
"There would indeed be poetic justice
and also justice of the law and consti
tution, if some of these extorted gains
could somehow be recovered for the
unfortunate small stockholders who are
the patties really defrauded. The
government, as we shall presently see,
may recover its entire claim without
allowance for equitable set-off, but how
and whence are the confiding share
holders to get hack their money when a
whole century's earnings are to be
pledged to others in advance of them''
l rue, the attorney-general has mow
against the Stanford estate ostensil
on behalf of this maturing claim of ti.„
government, but it is likely that this
was intended and understood by counsel
more to "stay waste" of the assets than
irj the hope of securing any part to the
treasury, and in this way the prosecu
ti< u is a real service to the Stanford
University rather than an injury as is
sometimes alleged . Had all the great
fortunes made out of this government
subsidy experiment been disposed of
for objects as worthy, and placed in as
enlightened and competent hands as
this one, Congress and the public
might indeed overlook or condone the
irregularity of their acquisition."
"Compulsory or pursuing legislation

is at best futile; the sovereign authority
cannot be resorted to except as an ex
traordinary or war power; assignment
of the stockholders' rights is hardly
practicable, because it is but a first step
in an untried policy looking far beyond
the recovery of the debts. There re- j
mains the alternative of mutual accom
modation. Valuable as are these lines I
of railway with their affiliated connec-1
tions, in the hands of their owners, the 1
co-operation of stockholders is necessary
to meet these onerous claims. The
margin between solvency and insol
vency is too narrow to tolerate clashing
or forcible measures. The nation be
ing a larger customer of the roads is
enabled to get some current return
upon its outlay, the equivalent of a low
rate of interest. By simply withhold
ing the compensation lor transport, it
gets, taking a series of years together,
a rate of one and a half per cent, on
the new debt (or three per cent, on the
old); or, taking the corporations separ
ately, about two per cent, from the east
ern and one per ceut.. from the western, j
the disparity being caused by the j
double volume of public service accru- i
ing to the Union company. An insu'-j
rection or foreign war might carry the
yield much higher. In view of the
equitable considerations above named,
and the fact whatever the amounts de- j
manded, and time granted, the pay
ments must be a tax upon the local
traffic, is not this enough and a fair
basis for commutation of interest?
How about the repayment of the
principal ? Some inducement should
be provided for its early liquidation, j
The maturity of a fraction of the sub
sidy bonds does not alter the moral, nor
seriously the legal, status oft tie parties.
It is the duty of the nation to help the
credit of its debtor where its own claims
are not prejudiced thereby. It can j
grant an extension of time, a long time,
without sacrifice, and as it can do
nothing practicable but that, that should
be doue willingly and helpfully. This
extension need not be as great as some
of the bills before Congress provide,
viz , a fixed period of fifty or a hundrid
years, all of which is to be consumed in
the process, but ought to be a max
imum period of a hundred years, with
au inducement to shorten the period.''
"The conduct of the negotiation has
passed from the president of the com
pany to a tripartite combination of the
government directors and a reorganiza
tion committee of bondholders or the
stockholding directors on the one side,
with the two committees of Congress
and the executive on the side of the
government. No final settlement is
likely to be reached before the new
Congress convenes, both because of
want of time to thresh out so compli
cated a question, and because a major
ity of each house lacks confidence in
the recommendations of its committee.
It- will take such a body a long time to
discover for itself the controlling ele
ments of this settlement, since it, will
jot give credence to its own organs nor
to the advocates of the railroad com
panies."
