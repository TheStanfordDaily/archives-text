Those of us who have followed the
course of the lieilly bill in Congress
may have found it difficult to square
our desires in the matter with the
prevalent hostility to that measure.
The article in the Amuth, quoted on
another page, will serve to put the
matter in a cleaier light. The Cal
ifornia position is fully examined,
and the futility of foreclosure abund
antly demonstrated. The action of
the Attorney General in filing a claim
against the Stanford estate is re
garded merely as a hit of diplomacy,
and not seiiously meaut. The writor
contends that a funding accommoda
lion is both wise and just, and the
only practical thing to do, and he
hopeful that the next Congress
will take hold of the matter in an
effective way.
