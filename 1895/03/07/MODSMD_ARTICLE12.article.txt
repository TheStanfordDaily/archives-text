In spite of all that has been said
by the professors against the indis
criminate use of books in the Uni
versity library and in the private
libraries of the professors, and in
spite of the continual harping upon
the subject in these columns, the
fact still remains that a certain class
of students are taking a shameful
advantage ot the professors who
place special books at the students'
disposal. There are some individuals
who treat this matter of monopoliz
ing a book fora week or so as a
huge joke, when in reality it is
nothing short of contemptible. Dur
ing the past week several books were
removed as soon as they were priced
at the disposal of a class which is
making a special study, and though,
in order to carry on its work, it is
necessary for the class to have the
books, some few students are mon
opolizing them. It is evident that
such persons do not realize what
they are doing, or, if they do, they
are not fit to be University students.
Such methods should be brought to
an end at once.
