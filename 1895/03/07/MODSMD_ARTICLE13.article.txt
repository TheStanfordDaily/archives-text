At present it looks as if the ef
forts to form an Athletic Association
will not amount to anything, The
student body has refused to adopt
the constitution for the proposed as
sociation, and the general attitude
of the University is indifferent to the
whole subject. In the face of the
dissatisfaction that has been so often
expressed during the past year in re
gard to the control of athletics this
is surprising, to say the least, and

cau be accounted for only on the
ground that the student body has al
lowed itself to become iudillerent to
the sulij ;ct now that the reason has
passed when the defects in our pres
ent system aie most apparent. Noth
ing was accomplished when the in
terest in athletics was at its highest
poiut, and now the proposed con
stitution has been rejected. At
such a rate we will never
have a satisfactory management ot
athletics. The thing to. do, there
fore, is for some immediate action to
be taken looking toward a speedy
settlement of the matter. It is evi
dent to all that if we are to have a
new system to control athletics, it
should be adopted this semester, so
that it can be put into working order
at the beginning of the football
season.
