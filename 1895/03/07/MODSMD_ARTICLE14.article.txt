# Original Poem for Founders' Day Exercises
## 
### 
The following hymn, written by Prof.
A.. W. Smith, and arrauged to the air,
"Austria," will be sung on Saturday
night at the Founders'Day exercises:
Stanford University.
u Die Luft der Freiheit Weht."
Through thy arches, ever blowing,
"Wind of freedom" sweeps along;
Clearing mists from truth, foreshowing
Right triumphant over wrong;
Human hearts forever growing
Tender, loving, deep, and strong.
Wind of freedom, wind of freedom,
Sing we glorious freedom's song.
From the sun of freedom streaming,
Light upon the darkness shines;
'Neath a bow of promise gleaming,
Tliy fair courts and walls enshrines.
For humanity's redeeming
Here the sun of freedom shines.
Sun of freedom, sun of freedom,
Here the sun of freedom shines.
Here another prophet kneeling
Saw the bush aflame, and rose;
Heard humanity's appealing;
Smote the rock with mighty blows.
Gushing forth the stream all-liealing
Ever for the nation Hows.
For the nation, for the nation,
Healing for the nation flows.
