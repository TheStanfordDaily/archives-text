Mrs. Stanford i.s on a pleasure trip
j south, and has been spending the last
i few days in and around Los Angeles
In Saturday's edition of the Herald of
that city appears an interview with her,
i from which the following in extracted:
It is my highest aim to carry out the
Senator's plans for the University. I
have every conlidence in Dr. Jordan,
and I know that everything will be well
done under his management. We have
1,100 students now, and 1 am gratified
! and touched by the great interest they
take in the University. 1 have not
I made any improvements yet. 1 cannot
do so until this U'gal matter with the
government is arranged. 1 cannot tell
you what I think the outcome of the
suit will be. I am not competent to
judge. 1 leave that to the wise advice
of my lawyers, and know that if a
decision is given by a number of wise,
just, and upright men, all will be well.
It seems to me it canuot be otherwise;
then I shall make Stanford Uni
versity one which will attract the youth
of the whole nation. One thing I will
say, the Democratic party has always
treated the matter in an equitable and
just manner, and I know I have the
sympathy of many.
