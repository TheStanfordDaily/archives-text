It is a matter of surprise and re
gret to each new comer here that the
drinking facilities in and about the j
fjuad are so poor. Students who'
come from neighboring towns, or
from any distance, are subjected to
much discomfort on account of the
lack of drinking water. Even those
who live near the quadrangle are in- i
convenience d by having to walk home i
fora glass of water. Provision was
made vshen the University was
erected, but the hydrant water is un
endurable. It is an imposition to
ask eleven hundred students and
professors to remain four hours and
longer without any possible chance
to qualF the " pure, unadulterated
ale of Father Adam." Yet with the
beginning of our new system of fil
tering tanks we hope fora speedy
remedy for the task of chewing
water; otherwise earthen jars of pure
cold water should be placed at each
corner of the quadrangle.
