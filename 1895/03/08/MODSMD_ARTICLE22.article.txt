In attempting to choose the best
possible from the baseball tal
ent of the University and to place
the men in such a manner as to form
the best team out of the material
available, Capt. Dyer has found it
necessary to make some changes.
There should be no dissatisfaction
aroused by this action. Capt. Uver
is the one most deeply concerned in
the success of the team. There is
no other way but for him to use his
own judgment in these matters; and
others who may have different opin
ions can rest assured that he has the
interests of the Varsity at heart.;
Tomoirow's game is our first in
the schedule of the Amateur League.
Stanford must win this first gnnie.
A victory tomorrow will restore con-■
tidence, and arouse the enthusiasm ,
essential fora creditable baseball
season. Any sulking or lack of loy
alty to the captain is not to be tol
erated. One who should so far for-;
get his duty to the University would
certainly have cause in the future to 1
regret his mistake.
