# The
						New Episcopalian Chapel.
## 
### 
The new Episcopalian chapel just
completed in Palo Alto was built pri
marily for the accomodation of the Uni
versity students. Its location in Palo
Alto is due simply to the impossibility
of building it on the campus. The
funds by which the expense of its con
struction have been met in full con
sisted almost entirely of donations from
wealthy Episcopalians in the ea&t. Cor
nelius Vanderbilt made the largest of
these gifts. These donors had in mind
only the interests of the University
students. â€¢
To the Rev. It. B. Peet is due most
of the credit for the successful manage
ment of the erection of the new church
The first services in it will be held next
Sunday at 11 a.m.
