# Benefit Concert.
## 
### 
There has been a constant cry for
'â€¢ Stanford music" ever since the open
ing of the University and, although
there have been songs, solos, cct. com
posed by our musicians, no suitable op
portunity has offered itself for present
ing these compositions to the student
body. The Orchestra numbers amongst
its members some who have consider
able talent in the line of music composi
tion, and has decided to make the com
ing benefit concert, March 15, as much
a Stanford affair musically as possible.
It is the intention of the management to
give the audience a chance to hear for
the first time several compositions by
tur well-known musicians, and it is
rumored that the audience will be
given an opportunity to judge as to the
merits of a catchy 00 Junior march
dedicated to the Cla r s of '00 by Mr.
Kaufman. Miss Kudolph will assist

and give a varied program of interest
and merit.
Miss lludolph r was born in Sacra
mento, California, twenty-two years
ago, and, for her age, is a most versatile
and clever young lady. To the natural
charm of her manuer she adds the ut
most self-possession, and has that viva
cious manner so pleasing in public
readers or singers. Iler clear, musical,
and trained voice, her capital and true
to-life impersonations are striking and
impressive. Miss lludolph was a pupil
of Prof. Curry of Harvard University
for three years, and throughout her
brief career on the stage has met with
flattering success everywhere.
The seats will be on sale at the post
office Monday morning.
