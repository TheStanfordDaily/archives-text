# SHAKSPERE AND HIS PLAYS.
## A 						Scholarly Lecture by America's Greatest Tragedian. 
### 
Mr. Warde's subject, "Shakspere
and his Plays," was a very broad one,
and much (if the material at hand had
to be treated in a cursory manner, lie
spoke of the dramatic instinct in us all,
the lofty mission of the actor, the an
tiquity of the drama, and Shakspere's
immortal position in dramatic history
After a brief outline of the few known
facts in Shakspere's life, with some
short discussion of the Baconian theory,
which Mr. Warde heartily condemned,
he proceeded to the second division of
his subjectâ€”the plays themselves. He
pointed out the incentive to education
that the production of these plays pro
vides; even the "super" who brings out
the Roman banners from the property
room is led to ask if the true meaning
of the letters S. P. Q. 11. is what
stage tradition ascribes to thetu.
Mr. Warde's first recited selection
was the advice of Polonius, followed by
Cassio's apostrophe to drink, from
Othello. He emphasized the religious
spirit that permeates the plays of Shaks*
peie. As examples of this, he recited
Wolsey's soliloquy, the prayers of
Henry the Fifth, and of Richmond, and
the soliloquy of the king in Hamlet.
Mr. Warde said that to his mind the
best commentators of Shakspere are
the Germans, although later he ex
pressed disapproval of those who dig
down under the play for their mean
ing, which is the habit of those same
German commentators more or less.
The lecturer next outlined the play
of Hamlet, discussiug at some length
the character of the melancholy Dane
and his alleged insanity. Mr. Warde's
idea of the eharcter is that the antic
disposition was assumed. He pointed
out that the keynote to the interpreta
tion of nearly every Shaksperean char
acter is to be found in the first soliloquy
given that character in the play. This
is so in the Merchant of Venice, which
Mr. Warde outlined; he recited different
jtarts of the Trial Scene, and followed
with some bits from As You Like It
The actor incidentally remarked with
reference to Orlando that the poetry of
all young men is invariably poor.
Surely Mr. Warde does not read the
Sequoia.
Mr. Warde recited delightfully sev
eral humorous selections from As You
Like It, Hamlet, and Midsummer
Night's Dream, the "Seven Ages of
Man" being particularly fine. The
actor ended with an earnest plea fora
general acquaintance with the plays of
Shakspere.
There is one criticism to be made
upon Mr. Warde's lecture. Entertain
ing as he made it, it would have been
doubly so if instead of the general re
marks upon the drama and Shakspere's
life lie had made his 1< cture more per
sonal and yiven more of his own rela
tion to the different Shaksperean char
acters he has played, The second part

of his lecture was much more pleasant
than the first because his discussion of
Hamlet was an epitome of his own im
pressions from playing the part, and
what the characters meant to the man
himself was something that books could
not have given us Altogether the
lecture was delightful and the chance
to hear the Queen's English so beauti
fully enunciated is an unusual treat.
