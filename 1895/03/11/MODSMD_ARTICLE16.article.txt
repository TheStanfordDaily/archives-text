# A
						Course of Law Lectures.
## 
### 
Beginning about the first of May,
Joseph Hutchinson of San Francisco
bar will deliver a course of eight lec
tures before the Stanford law students
on "General outlines of practice under
the California Code of Procedure."
The lectures will be technical in
their nature and, while intended prim
arily for law students, any one inter
ested may attend. It is probable that
two lectures will be given each week.
