# Yesterday's Sermon.

### 
Rev. Robert MiSekeuzie preached the
Sunday sermon. His text was taken
from Matthew—chapter xiii., verse 3:
"Behold a sower went forth to sow,"
What your specific religious need
may be, I cannot know; yet my words
may not be without profit, for there are
two things always the same—the human
heart and the word of God. I am here
to read the scriptures. The Bible is an
out-of-door book, and herein differs from
other religious books. It is a rustic,
red-cheeked book, setting its truth in a
framing of green hills, blue waters
checkered fields, or in the star-lit night
sky. Christ's teachings follow the same
line. Our text is in the springtime of
his teaching, and in the springtime of
the year. It was altogether natural
that there should be some affinity be
tween him and his surroundings. As
he sits in the stern of the boat, looking
on the increasing multitude, wondering
how he shall speak the word, his at
tention is called to a sower. It is an
imposing sight—the black field trodden
by the peasant with his slow, steady,
wide-swinging gait. Most of Christ's
teachings are in the form of parables.
He gives us thirty-one in all, and they
all have to do with the kingdom ot God
and righteousness that shall fit man to
look in the face of God and not be
ashamed. They may be divided into
three groups, however: 1. The nature
of the kingdom; 2. The members of the
kingdom; 3. The destiny of the king
dom and of its members.
Our parable is the first parable of the
first group. The kingdom of Christ
begins in the human heart by the im
parting of something to it that is not
there originally. Whether a person is
learned or ignorant, broad or narrow,
he cannot produce the kingdom of God
by natural development any more than
he can reap a harvest of grain where
no seed was sown. Education and cul
ture will develop a man for all that is
in him—originally, potentially in him.
But Christ tells us that the kingdom of
God is not originally in any man. In
order to get it, the seed must be sown.
That is God's method everywhere and
always has been. First the blade,
then the car, and then the corn in car
—could it be better stated? What do
you wish to prow? If weeds, the seeds
arc there already; but if wheat, you
must plough and harrow and sow seeds.
The uecessary seed is the word of
God, revealed through Christ and re
corded in the gospels. The germ of
his kingdon is the word that is heard
in the ear and received into the heart.

"This is life eternal," said Christ the
last day he fell on his knees and looked
into the face of God, "that they may
know Thee, the only true God, and
Jesus Ohiist whom Thou hast sent."
It is the one thing lasting, forever old,
forever new. The scedman may fail
you, the seed never.
The fate of the seed, when sown, is
determined by the condition of the
ground into which it falls. Christ saw
four classes of hearers as he looked
upon that gathering multitude, led by
popular excitement rather than relig
ion. There were indifferent people
who came to hear him because they
thought it was the proper thing to do.
Some were earnest and eager; others
with preoccupied faces thinking of the
anxiety of yesterday or the cares of to
morrow. But there were those who, sin
cere, listened without rapture tothe voice
of the Master running on like a stream of
joy. lie says there are little foot
paths beaten by generations of men and
beasts. Some seed falls by the side of
these little paths but has no opportun
ity to grow. The possibilities of the
soil were good but the two did not
couie in contact properly. This is
typical of those who hear and only
hear, those who listen to a sermon as if
it were a lecture on chemistry. There
are stony-ground hearers. The rock is
near the surface of the earth aud seed,
falling on the shallow soil, has not room
for its roots; and then the drought
comes and when the north wind conies
it is parched or torn from the earth.
This is typical of those who heard in a
revival meeting and did not get much
below the feelings. These are work
ing in the endeavor societies and are
constantly saying that the church does
not do enough. Then the drouth
comes and the north wind comes and
they say, "It is different now. I have
learned so much about bugs in the
University that I cannot believe in
Christianity." Lay not the blame
upon the bug. Lay not the blame
upon the professor or the college, but
upon the scanty soil into which the
seed fell. lam here to stand for lib
eral education. When the word of
God goes into a human heart, no
teacher ever tried or ever wished to
remove it. ;
I see no incompatibility between a
Christian life and pleasure and wealth.
Christianity does not ask you to be a
recluse and walk these corridors like
Thomas a Kempis, but to go into the
world and make a fortune if you wish;
and if out of these struggles with the
world you can come in the evening un
interrupted by the follies and vices sur
rounding you, no one can complain of
your freedom.
