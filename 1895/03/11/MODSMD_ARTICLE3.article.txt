# OLYMPICS 9, STANFORD 4.
## The
						Varsity Loses the First Game of the Season. 
### 
The Varsity played its first game
this season Saturday with the Olympics,
and was taken into camp by the score
of 0 to 4. The Olympics scored all

their runs in three innings by bundling
their hits and taking advantage of
Stanford's errors. Weldon's delivery
was very puzzling, and lie was fairly
supported by his team. This makes his
fourth successive victory this season in
which but lour hits have been made off
his delivery each time. McLaine was
not hit so hard as the score would in
dicate. His support was not good, and
several of the hits made off him came
after chances had been given to retire
the side. lie struck out ten men.
The Olympics started out by making
three runs in the first inning and two
more in the third. For Stanford, Ray
scored in the second, getting first on an
error and being forced in by Weldon,
who hit ltusteil with the ball and gave
Calhoun and Pincus bases on balls. In
the third Lewis got first on an error,
stole second and went to third on an
overthrow by the catcher, aud came
home on a wild pitch. In the fourth
Ilussell scored on a safe hit, an error, a
pass ball, and a sacrifice by Pincus. In
the sixth singles by White aud llm-sel',
a steal and a sacrifice hit, brought in
another run for Stanford. At ibis
stage of the game it looked as if Stan
ford might win, but the Olympics
clinched the game by making four runs
in the eighth inning.
Catcher O'Kane missed his train and
did not arrive till the game was half
over. Cordes caught until O'Kane
put in an appearance. Sheehan w:*s
knocked sensless by a collision with the
Olympic first baseman in the first in
ning but recovered enough to play out
the game. The score:
