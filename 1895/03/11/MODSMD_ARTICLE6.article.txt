Mu. Warde's lecture Friday even
ing was ft treat. The eminent act
or's entertainment was almost above
criticism. No one of the large audi
ence will soon forget the charming
personality and artistic merit dis
played by the great tragedian. Mr.
Warde takes with him to his Eastern
home the best wishes of us all, not
only on account of the pleasure af
forded by his recital, but because of
his free and open generosity.
