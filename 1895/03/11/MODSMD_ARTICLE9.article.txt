An attempt was umile in the spring
of 18!)2 to Lave au excursion to some
well-known point in California a
feature of University Memorial Day.
Kvery means was employed to mako

these excsursi>x)B a success. Fome
members of the faculty went so far
as to pledge themselves for the pay
ment of the necessary expenses. In
that and the following year the ex
cursions were largely attended and
greatly enjoyed. Studeuts from the
East, in particular, took advantiige
of the opportunily for visiting the
historic towns of Santa Ctuz and
Monterey.
Last year, through an utter lack of
interest, the excursion was not run.
The students appointed to sell tick
ets went at their woik without suf
ficient energy or interest, and the
faculty had become tired of taking
the whole responsibility. As a result
the idea was abandoned. It is to be
hoped that the Student Body will
take hold of the affair this year and
make it a success. There could be
no more pleasant and instructive
way of spending a holiday.
