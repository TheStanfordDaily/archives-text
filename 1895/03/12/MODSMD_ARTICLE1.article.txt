### 
A good sized audience listened to the
regular Founders' Day exercises in the
chapel Saturday evening. Prof. Parties
read an interesting paper on "The Suc
cessor of the Established Church." lie
began with an outline of the relations
formerly existing between the Church
and education, and a tribute to the
work of Christianity in advancing
knowledge. Continuing, be said in sub
stance: Today most of the functions of
civilization are passing into the hands of
public education. This is only of
recent growth—in institution of the
present century. The central idea
around which it gathers is that no soci
ety is stronger than the sum of its in
dividuals, and that individuals can be
improved through the public care. Al
ready its propoilions are startling The
new public education extends to all
ages, classes, and sexes. It is today the
favored child of the state, and is linked
inseparably to the state. It is the pa
tron and preserver of the new learning.
It is becoming today the conservor of
public mora sand, in a sense, the dis
penser of public charities. On the
other hand, the church is being reuiod
eled. A modern city ehurch, Cath
olic or Unitarian, is an educational in
stitution. 'i'lie comparison between
church and state comes home to us
with especial force here at Stanford;
our life is half scholastic, half monastic.
The speaker then touched on the
founding of this University,and the con
ditions of the new university life. lie
spoke of the new ideas in education
which Stanford is trying to foster, and
the new ideals she is holding up to the
world. In conclusion he told a story
to illustrate Senator Stanford's char
acter and his ideas concerning the Uni
veieity.
Mrs. Smith followed with a paper on
4 Some Tendencies in Women's Educa
tion."
She began by a description of the
conditions of early female education and
tlie foundation of Western co-educa
tional institutions. Eastern scholars
and tcachers were shockcd at the crud
ity which they met in these colleges. In
their eyes all improprieties, crudities,
uncouventionalitics, were the result of
that vicious principle, co-education. In
New England, consequently, social
conservatism compelled a less radical
volution of the problem of Women's
Education. Following the type of Vas
sar, Wellesley and Smith were founded;
still with a curriculum founded on the
old classical model of Yale.
The tendency to provide the same
kind of education for women as lor men,
produced some unexpected results.
Women who were co-educated special
ized, fell in love in a hopelessly fem
inine manner; sweet, docile creatures
from women's colleges went into law and
medicine and lived happy, unrcgretful
lives. The same contradictions were to
be found among men. The orthodox
become heterodox, and behold every
thing was topsy-turvy. Given a boy, a

girl, and a curriculum—Results: the
boy a poet, the girl a lawyer, and the
curriculum something which had missed
fire. Into the midst of this uncertainty
the elective system was projected; the
idea spread like wildfire, but not to the
women's colleges. If the girl followed
her bent, who knew what might hap
pen ?
A liberal allowance of the classics, a
little harmless inorganic science, some
music or art, constituted the regimen of
the typical woman's college. No op
portunities were offered for young
women to enter any profession except
literature and teaching. Meanwhile
the great tide of scientific education
had arisen; evolution had been accepted
by the great scientists. Women, more
conservative, continued to choose classi
cal courses long after science had be
come the most prominent feature of the
youuger institutions. Slowly women's
colleges were compelled to add the
more modern scientific courses.
The speaker then closed with a sum
mary of present conditions in the
women's colleges, and a prophecy of
their future as regards course and cur
riculum.
" Wind of Freedom," a stirring
hymn by Professor A. W. Smith, was
then sung by the audience.
