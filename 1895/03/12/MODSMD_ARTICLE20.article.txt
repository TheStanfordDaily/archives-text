It has been noticed of late that
there is more and more of a tend
ency on the part of chapel goers to
take aisle seats, no matter how early
the party may arrive. It is the
same at lectures as at all other meet
ings; the seats nearest tho passage
are taken while a great number of
inaccessible, vacant seats remain in
the middle of tho room to be gazed
at by those who are standing or
who are sitting in some out of the
way corner when they might be sit
ting in desirable seats but for the
inconsiderato few. No lady or
gentleman likes to disturb three or
four persons in attempting to reach
the unoccupied places. In order to
make use of our exceedingly limited
chapel space, those who arrive there
earliost should take seats in the
middle of the hall so that later comers

can also obtain seats without caus
ing m-odless commotion.
