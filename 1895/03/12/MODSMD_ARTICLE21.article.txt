'I he preliminary field day is an
uouuctd to take place next Friday.
This will be the first opportunity af
foided the students here to accu
rately judge of what, material we are
possessed and to estimate the prob
able outcome of our next contest
with U. C. Everyone expects to ste
some good work done lÂ»y the men,
and unless each contestant does his
best, the benefits of our new path
and skillful training given the ath
letes will be underrated. A large
number of entries would be a most
encouraging sign and every student
of any promise at all should get out
next Friday and help athletics along
by entering some event. A good
showing this year against Berkeley
in the intercollegiate field-day means
much for next season.
