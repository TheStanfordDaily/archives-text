# The 						Cycle Club Will Give a Road-Race.
## 
### 
It is learned through some of the en
terprising members of the Cycle Club
that there is a scheme on foot to give a
road race in the near future. From
what can be learned, the road-race will
be a handicap and there will be four or
five prizes. Under such conditions it
is hoped that all the students who ride
will take an active part, as in a handi
cap there is a chance for everyone, and
no better chance to gain a few sweaters
will present itself.
Those who are training at the stock
farm each evening are acquiring consid
erable speed and even the weakest aro
becoming quite proficient and will sur
prise strong riders in competition.
The object of this handicap race is to
encourage regular training. The win
ners will probably be entered in the inter
club races to be given by the Garden
City Club in Aprilâ€”a road-race in
which the successful team will win a
$200 cup.
