# Prof. Aley on "Education at Stanford University."

### 
Robert J. Aley, in an article, "Ftudy
of Education at Stanford University,"
which appeared in the March number
of The Inter-State, School Itevieio, gives
high praise to our Educational depart
ment as conducted by Prof. Barnes.
Speaking of the University generally,
he says, "When Stanford University
was founded, the traditions of the past
were very generally ignored. A cur
riculum more liberal that of any Amer
ican college was prepared. Specialists,
selected not only for their scholastic
attainments but also for their ability to
teach, were placed in charge of the va
rious departments."
He then refers to Prof. Barues as a
particular example of this mode of selec
tion. "Professor Earle Barnes is a
skillful teacher. He is wedded to no
philosophy of the past. He worships
at neither the shrine of Ilerbart nor
Hegel. His long study of philosophy
under Shurman and his study of peda
gogics at Zurich convinced him that the
philosophies of the past are not suited
to the needs of today; he studies them
for the purpose of sifting out the truths
that are applicable to the present."
Respecting the position held by the
University in California, and particu
larly the Educational Department, Mr.
Aley says, further: "The department is
in close contact with, the schools of the
State, and is doing good work through
the co-operation of the ablest teachers.
The teachers of Oakland, Stocktou
Santa Rosa, and a number of other
cities are doing systematic work under
the personal direction of Prof. Barnes.
That the teachers of the State are in
sympathy with Prof. Barnes is shown
by his almost unanimous election to the
presidency of the State Teachers' As
sociation. The department is certainly
destined to influence for the better all
the schools of the Coast."
