# Professor Hussey's Lecture on Comets.
## 
### 
Pespite the rain the chapel room was
well filled last night to hear Prof, Hus
sey, arid see the stereopticon exhibition
of photographic slides of recently studied
comets. Prof. Hussey has made some
valuable astronomical discoveries by
means of the art of photography, not
ably a calculation of the speed of the
comet's tail particles. With the slides
taken from negatives taken by himself
at Lick Observatory, he gave an expo
sition of the theory in the lecture. lu
substance he spoke an follows:
To photograph a comet is not among
the newest acomplishtuents of astron
omy. The lirst satisfactory results in
this line of work were obtained nearly
fourteen years ago by Drs. Draper and
•lanssen.
In the following year the last great
comet made its appearance. Observers
in various parts of the world discovered
it independently eatly in September,
1882. Astronomers continued to ob
serve it until it became invisible iutheir
telescopes in the following June. It
was unquestionably the most magnifi
cent object of its kind that has been
presented to us during the last third of
a century Its brightness enabled the
astronomers at the Cape of Good Hope
to make a unique observation. On the
afternoon of September 17 they watched
it as it. approached the sun, and were
able to see it up to the time of its dis
appearance at the sun's edge.
The only place where this comet ap
pears to have been photographed was at
the I'oyal Observatory at the Cape of
(ioid Hope. 'J he astronomers there
strapped a camera having a large por
trait lens to one of their telescopes and
secured a number of photographs.
This was, 1 believe, the first time such
a lens was used for this purpose. The
results sufficiently demonstrated the ef
ficiency of portrait lenses for this kind
of astronomical work. Their short focal
length and great light power render them
especial 1}' suitable for photographing
objects having large angular dimensions,
mch as cornets, nebulae, and the milky
way.
From 1883 to 1S92 very few photo
graphs of comets were taken
During the past three years several
comets have appeared, but none of them
of sufficient size to be classed among
the great comets.
Further on, 1 shall call attention to
some of the phenomena exhibited by the
photographs of these cornets, and in
particular to those which have been
suggested by a study of my scries of
photographs of Kordamc's comet.
Visual observations have shown that
comets often undergo rapid and very
complete changes of form. Such
changes have been observed more fre
quently in the large comets than in the
small ones.
A comet is generally doing some- j
thing unexpected. The changes may j
occur in any of its parts. The nucleus
may be sharply defined and star-like, (r
ill defined, or even indistinguishable j

from the coma; or it may divide into
several nuclei. The coma may change
in size and density. Envelopes may be
thrown off, singly or in complex sys
tems. The tail may consist of a single
streamer, at least apparently so, or of
an indefinite number of them. The
streamers composing the tail may leave
the couia in a single compressed bundle,
or they may spring from it in widely
divergent and loosely connected groups;
they may be smooth and straight and
distinct, or they may be lumpy,
interlacing, and spirally twisted; or
again, they may be broken into frag
ments aud scattered as though they
were as smoke and driven by the wind.
All these changes may take place in one
aud the same comet, and in a short in
terval of only a few days. The forces
producing these changes undoubtedly
act according to fixed laws. The theory
is that matter iu a gaseous state is
driven from the nucleus by a repulsive
force and also subjected to the action of
a repulsive force from the sun which
drives it backward to form the tail.
The assumption usually made is that
the force is a case of electrical repul
sion, and that it has a surface action;
the force being the same for general
surfaces of any kind of matter.
Rredichin, from a study of the forms
of comets' tails, has classed them into
three types, as follows:
I. Those which ate very straight
and directed very exactly away from
the sun.
11. Those which are considerably
curved, being curved towards the di
rection of motion.
I LI. Those which are short and very
strougly curved, lying almost along the
direction of motion.
Dut the number of unknown quanti
ties remains greater than the number
of equations of condition. The solu
tions are, therefore, indeterminate.
Something more must be added by
observation before this tangle of com
plex relations can be unravelled. Any
independent data connecting the un
known quantities will be useful. The
velocities with which the particles com
posing the tail recede from the nucleus,
if they can be obtained observationally
with sufficient accuracy, will enable a
long step in the right direction to be
taken. It appears probable, from some
results already obtained, that photo
graphy may enable this to be done.
Among the conspicuous features
shown in some of the photographs of
recent comets, are the bright spots
which sometimes constitute a part of
the tail. For want of a better name
they arc 'called condensations. They
have occasionally been seen visually in
the great comets, but such observations
have been rare. They were beauti
fully photographed by Professor Rarn
ard in Swift's comct in April, 1892, and
in Hrooks' comet in November, 1893.
They were very conspicuous in some of
my photographs of ltordame's comet,
and they are to be found in others.
Condensations were unusually con

spicuous in Rordame's comet on July
13, 1893. On that evening I obtained
three photographs of the comet. The
first was obtained with the Crocker te'-
escope with an exposure of six minutes.
It shows the condensations clearly, and
the streamers to the edge of the plate.
From measurements made on one of
the most determinate condensations it
appears that it was receding from the
nucleus at a rate of sornewh?t more
that four hundred thousand miles an
hour, or about ten million miles a day
The rate was not less than this amount,
it may have been more. Such veloc
ities as these are highly significant
They must be taken into account in
considering the remarkable changes
which take place in the forms of the
tails of comets as exhibited by their
photographs. On account of them the
photographs are to a certain extent in
accurate and misleading.
In all cases it is necessary to regard
the tail as an object seen in projection,
and when we do this and recall that
the most conspicuous streamers are in
the ceutral part of the tail, we are
forced to believe that they have their
origin in the central part of the nucleus.
If this were not the case wc should
expect at times at least to see the most
conspicuous parts of the tail sometimes
along one or the other edges of the tail.
So far as I know this has not been the
case.
