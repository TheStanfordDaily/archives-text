No woman with a shrinking na
ture should undertake the study of
French unless she can bring herself
to translate it, as it is written. Every
â€¢ lay in the French classes some un
fortunate member of the softer sex
iuus afoul of that wicked but fre
queut expression "Mon Dieu" and
ufter great hesitation compromises
by translating it "Heavens!" This
elastic word has also been pressed
into service for "diable." "Oh my"
is a favorite alternative. But worse
than these is the dreailful word' en
fer," from which there is no possible
escape unless one has the rare pres

euce of mind to render the object
ionable phrase into "the place of de
parted spirits." Now all this beat
ing about the bush is very trying to
the masculine ear (bardeued to the
use of plain English) when it hap
pens to be near enough to hear the
still small voice that is translating.
It would be belter for all concerned
if the French text were lel't to the
mercy of the men and the new wo
men who believe in their methods.
