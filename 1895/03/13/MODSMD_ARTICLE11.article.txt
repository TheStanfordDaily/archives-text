The elect l ie bells have called forth
frequent criticism in these columns
and we are not through with them
yet. One of the suddest things in
our student life may be brought
about by irregularity in the quad
rangle bells. Often a student fits
watch in hand waiting for either the
professor or the bells to speak; when
finally, some five minutes alter the
bells should have sounded, he is
called upon to recite the unprepared
lesson, while the bells seem only
war'nc until he has flunked com
pletely to lingo last in ghoul
ish gee at his disaster, that particu
lar student is inclined to echo the
sentiments of this paper. On a dif
ferent occasion when some invited
guest comes forward to speak to us
and prefaces his lecture by saying,
"Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot
tell you how pleased and honored 1
am to speak to the students of this
Uniâ€”" whr-r-r, go the bells, which
is apt to make him uncomfortable.
Again, the lecturer, while not nat
urally humorous, has been trying to
enliven his talk with some stray bits
of humor, but just as he begins, "and
that reminds me of a little story,"
the bells rattle warningly. This is
generally embarassing, particularly
if the speaker's conscience be a little
tender as to the prospective story's
youth. Or perhaps it is the fair elo
cutionist doing Lady Macbeth, who
whispers, "Hark! Jiear ye not
a noise?" The bells give a spectac
ular effect entirely unexpected. All
this may be fun for the bells but it's
death to us and our friends. Until
we get the chimes that are to mark
the houre, we must growl away at
the bells until they are put in order
and made to ring at the proper time
and only then. When the chimes
are in place we believe there is to be
a student ringer. Then when we
are kept too long in an uncomfort
able class or some entertainer is
startled by a night alarm, the injured
person may know where to kill.
