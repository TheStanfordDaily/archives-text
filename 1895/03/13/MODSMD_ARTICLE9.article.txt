The Seminary iu Shakspere meets
in J'rcf. Anderson's office every
Tuesday afternoon. The English
students are supposed to know of
this, but the elasH is frequently in
terrupted by the sudden entrance of
some person who flings the door
open, enters breezily, and stands for
some time in a general survey of the
class until finally the true state of
affairs dawns upon the intruder and
the door is closed behind him with
as much noise as it was opened.
This habit of entering a class room
like a whirlwind is moreover a gen
eral one. When the professor in
charge of the class happens to be
standing at the board near the door
au accident is likely to occur—in
fact, has occurred on 6everal occas
ions. If people would take the
trouble to observe whether a room is
occupied and then, if they have busi
ness there, would enter with some
degrte of consideration, the rest of
the world would be gratified.
