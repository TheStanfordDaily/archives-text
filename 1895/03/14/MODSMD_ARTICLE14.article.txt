Until within the last few years the
lines which maiked the four classes
in a university were closely drawn.
Pride and precedence kept up the
custom uutil it was proven to be
detrimental to the best interests of
college life. Hazing in all of its
forms was the outcome of it, and
many disagreeable features in col
leges where class lines are still drawn
can be attributed to it. The result
has been that recently-founded in
stitutions have done away en
tirely with class distinctions, and
many of the older universities are
following ihe same line of advance
ment. The credit system of grad
uation in use here precludes the
possibility of any maiked differen
tiation in the University classes.
The advantages of such a system
have been apparent to all. There
have been no shocking cases of haz
ing, and there never will be. Haz
ing, even in the slightest degree, is a
tabooed institution at Stanford. The
system has prevented other object
ionable features from getting a foot
hold here, and we heartily commend
it; yet one cannot but regret that in
the general sweeping away of old
notions and precedents, it has also

takeu with it some of the brighter
and rtfined customs which have
hitherto been looked upon as attract
ive symbols of college life. One of
the most important and most pleas
ing of these is the wearing of the
cap and gown by the seniors. There
is a great deal that can be said in
favor of the custom, and very little
against it. Especially is this so
here. It would be hard to find a
place better suited lor the establish
ment of such a custom. The climate
permits the wearing of the cap and
gown throughout ihe college year.
The interior of the quadrangle and
all our surroundings would be per
fectly in harmony with this classic
custom.
The endorsement of the cap and
gown by the Pioneers would insure
their adoption by the classes which
are to follow.
