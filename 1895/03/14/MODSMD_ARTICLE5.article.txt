Yesterday's Game Won by Heavy Bat
ting.
'95 foreclosed its mortgage on the
sweaters yesterday by beating '1)7 by
the jug-handled score of 18 to 4. The
game was won by heavy batting; '97
tried three different men in the box
without making any perceptible differ
ence in the canonading. Outside of the
heavy batting of the Seniors the game
was comparatively featureless. The day
was chilly and the grounds wet from
Tuesday uight's rain, which tended to
discourage base running and last field
ing. The sc.»re:
'95.
