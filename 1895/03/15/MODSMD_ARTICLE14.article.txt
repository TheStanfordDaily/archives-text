The Graduate Society which is
forming, should have the hearty co
operation of all eligible members.
Such a club is as important as an
ulumni association, and has elements
that are even more beneficial to tbe
members. There cannot but accrue
u vast benefit to young men and
women who have come as graduates
from divers universities to pursue a
more advanced culture within the
hospitable arcades of Stanford.
Such a gathering represents the sur
vival of the fittest, the highest type
of ambitious young people, who, if
brought together, will not only be
mutually helpful, but will extend a
broadeuing influence over the whole
college area.
