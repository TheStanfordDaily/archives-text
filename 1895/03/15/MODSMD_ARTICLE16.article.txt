In a few months the Freshman
will be a thing of the dead past. As
tin individual he will disappear, will

and 11 swift blush diffuses bis soft
cheek as he catches the eye of the
senior girl whom be took walking
the previous evening. lie still
asks when introduced, if this is your
first year here, and what your major
is, and evinces great auxiety as to
whether or not' "evolution upsets
one's religious beliefs."
