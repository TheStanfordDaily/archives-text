Prof Howard's "at home"andthe
Ruble reception are anticipated
with pleasure. Too much cunnot
be said upon the happiness that a
1i t tie social life affords students
whose existence is one of intellectual
monotony. A faculty reception is al
ways fraught with pleasure, and is of
value in bringing professors and
students into agreeable social rela
tions.
There is no "fun" in the Univer
sity superior to that indulged in by the
llobleites and their lister students
at their fancy dress parties. The
arrogant Encinan who fondly im
agines that the girls are sea ed with
fancy work pining for bis society
while be is attending a stag-party at
a Mayfield palace, would be some
what chagrined could be behold the
demure damsels in festive atlire,
holding flitting carnivals with each
other at ltoble, behind closed doors.
There are iudeed pleasures on the
campus that will in time win Stan
ford tirst place as a| social as well
as intellectual factor in modern ed
ucation.
