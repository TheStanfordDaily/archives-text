The evolution lectures possess
unusual interest nowadays as tbev
are dealing with that mysterious,
capricious, elusive topic, woman.
Et is comfortable to feel how much
farther advanced our generation is
than the recent one which produced
that "Prince of mean old things,"
Herr Schopenhauer. His ideas are
so extreme and so ridiculous that
the feminine half of an audience
does not even become aDgry when it
hears the kitchen, the nursery, and
the plow allotted to woman.
Thrice blessed does the enlight
ened co-ed feel to have so liberal
and noble a champion as Dr. Jor
dan. The young men, however
narrow and conservative, could not
listen to the just and modern ideas
of our President without raising
their staudards of womankind, and
increasing their self-respect in pro
portion.
Nor is "woman" the only subject
treated with absolute fairness and in
the twentieth century spirit. Morality
appeals to one almost more forcibly
from an evolutionary standpoint
than from an ethical or sentimental
side. It is not only good to be good
but it is expedient and normal to be
so. There are many students that
enter evolution with a view to a snap
who 112 like Goldsmith's wanderer,
"came to scoff but remain to pray."
