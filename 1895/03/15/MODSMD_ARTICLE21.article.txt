# Pinafore.
## 
### 
It has been definitely decided to give
Pinafore in the gyni. immediately after
the Easter vacation, and as the expenses
of the opera will be very heavy, it will
be run two nights, April 5 and G.
The scenic work will be very elaborate,
the contract having been let to the
scenic artist of the California Theater,
and the costumes will be "up to date."
It has been found necessary to deepen
the stage on account of the size of the
choruses and in order to give ample
room for the scenic effects.
Arrangements have been made to
supply each member of the Orchestra
with a shaded light so arranged as not
to interfere with the moonlight effect in
the second act.
Novelties will be introduced each
night, so that those who attend both
performances will hear something dif
ferent each night.
Seats will be placed on Rale at the
Registrar's office next Weducsday at
1:30 p.m., and from here the box sheet
will go to lielmont, San Mateo, Red
wood, and other adjacent towns. There
have been numerous inquiries for seats
from San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose,
and towns across the bay; so it behooves
Stanford people to come early aud avoid
the rush.
The price of ticket.* is seventy-five
cents for reserved seats, aud fifty cents
general admission.
