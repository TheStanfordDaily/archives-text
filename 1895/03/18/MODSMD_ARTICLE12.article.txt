Jenkin Lloyd Jones, who will de
liver two lectures here tomorrow, is
a man of recognized ability. For
many years Lie was a Unitarian min
ister in Chicago, but more recently
his church has organized as an in
dependent congregation, lie was a
prominent figure in the World's
Parliament of Religions, of which
he was secretary. As a speaker he
is forcible and convincing. On the
subjects of his two lectures tomor
row, "The Relation of Evolution to
lleligion" and " Emerson," few men
are better prepared to speak than he.
Crowded audiences will doubtless
greet the noted divine.
