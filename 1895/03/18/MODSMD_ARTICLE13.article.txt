The faculty has at last taken a
definite stand in the matter of cheat
ing in examinations, and certain
students have been dropped after
their dishonesty has been detected.
General sentiment will certainly ap
prove this method of punishment.
So much has been written and said
about student honor, so many dif
ferent w tys have been tried to remedy
the evil, that the student who per
sists iii cheating is phiinly unworthy
of tho University h favor. These
severe measures entail upon the fac
nliy un added duty, however. All
temptation should be removed so far
as it is possible. This does notnuan
that, students should be requested to
discard their cult's or shut bosoms
at the class-room door, or submit
their dainty, embroideied handker
chiefs to official inspection. But
there can be at least a class room
rule ns to the seats during an ex
amination. A number of the pro
fessors enforce such a rule: it is con
sidered no reflection upon the honor

of the class. Many of tlie class
rooms ure too crowded for the pur
pose, and a division of the class
means trouble and loss of time; hut
it is a question whether the time and
trouble are wasted. Then, too, the
professor should not absent himself
for any marked length of time from
the class-room. It may be putting
the class upon its honor; it is also
putting- strong temptation in its way.
The penalty is a severe one; it is the
duty of all to lessen the dunger of
incurring it.
