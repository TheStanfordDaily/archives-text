Perhaps nothing is so susceptible
to distraction as the attention of a
class. No matter how interesting or
important the lecture may be, the
eves of the class will deflect in an iu
stant if there is anything near the
windows of the class-room. Conse
quently, when the students for the
next hour gather and hold heated
caucuses on various absorbing
topics, the class inside is apt to suf
fer. The law students are the prin
cipal offenders, and even their argu
ments, however interesting, are out
of season. While there is probably
no antidote for the loving couple who
stroll slowly by the windows and
turn every head in the class room, or
for the pleasant but rather intrusive
gossip of Jehu and his tribe, still the
law students might easily defer their
debates until the meeting of the law
clubs, or at least until their hour
has come. If the library at Encinu
is at all like the main reading-room
in adaptability to general conversi
tion, it would be a very good place
for their discussions.
