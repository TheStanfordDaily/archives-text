Some time during' the litsfc year of
the University Mrs. Stanford re
quested that there bo no smoking
about the college buildings. This
would seem to apply particularly to
the quadrangle, where smoking
would be as ill-bred as the wearing
of one's hat in the class room?.
Such a request was not a great one,
and those who do not respect it
deserve severe criticism. There has
been considerable smoking outside
certain class-rooms lately, the smoke
passing iu through the windows
This is discourteous to the professor
in charge, to say nothing of the class,
even though the professor himself be
an inveterate smoker at tho proper
times; it is doubly discourteous when
the instructor is a lady. Several of
the professors have complained of
this thoughtlessness, and a suggest
ion should remedy it at once. It is
no more than just, however, that the
student who throws away his half
finished cigar on lenching tho quad
should not scent a familiar fragrance
when he passes the door of tho in
structor's office. It is apt to dis
courage his courtesy.
