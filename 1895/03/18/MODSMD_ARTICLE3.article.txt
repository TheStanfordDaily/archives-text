# The
						Orchestra Benefit.
## 
### 
About two huudrcd people attended
the Orchestra benefit on Friday eveu
ingâ€”a small number considering the
merit of the cause. The entertain
ment began promptly at eight, and was,
for the most part, satisfactory. The
Orchestra, under the direction of 11.
Connick, reudered its various numbers
very well, notably the " Pilgrims'
Chorus" from "Taunhauser," which is
especially difficult for the violins. The
chief interest, however, attached to the
three pieces by local composers.
V. V. Clark did himself credit with a
pleasing clarinet solo, "Moonlight Rev
eries." P. 11. Abbott sang a "Sere
nade" by Henry Harris, the words
being by Edward liulme. The song is
a very pretty one, and Mr. Abbott's fine
singing did it full justice, 'i he "Junior
Hop March" by A. G. Kaufman was
warmly received, and should be heard
again.
The Orchestra was assisted by Miss
Carrie Rudolph, who has appeared here
before. Her impersonations are enter
taining, though some of them have the
flavor of antiquity.
The Orchestra's next appearance will
be in the big production of "Pinafore"
on April 5 and 0.
