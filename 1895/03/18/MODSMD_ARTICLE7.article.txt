# AN EASY VICTORY.
## Reliance Beaten 22 to 4. 
### 
The Varsity was treated to an agree
able surprise Saturday afternoon when
they batted the uiuch-talked-of Oliver
out of the box and won from the Reli
ance by a score of 22 to 4 McLaine
did supeib work in the box and was
well supported by Russell. He struck
out twelve men and but six scattering
hits were made oIF his delivery. Rus
sell is putting up better ball each game.
He had no passed balls Saturday aud
his throwing was usually sure. A man
with such an erratic arm as his, how
ever, should get over the habit of try
ing to catch a man napping off third
base when two men are out. This
over anxiety to finish the inning costa
run in the seventh, McLaine hit safely
four times, while White led on the
bases. The team played well together
throughout the game until the eighth,
when short and third weakened. Cal
houn left the game during the seventh
inning on account of illness and was re
placed by .Jeff. The score follows:
