Some of the embryo civil engineers
lay themselves open to needless
criticism and frequent though una
voidable malediction by the reckless
manner in which they run their rail
road curves and Bpirala around all
ftequented paths, instead of choos
ing some unoccupied ground for the
work. Their stakes, driven with
wot'ul prodigality, are left sticking
out of the ground just high enough
to menace life and limb of pedes
trians Stakes and bench marks
should be taken care of when they
ure of no further use.
