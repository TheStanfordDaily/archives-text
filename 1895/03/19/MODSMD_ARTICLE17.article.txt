Youth is proverbially selfish.
Young men and women, lacking the
experience and the judgment which
enables one to see things from other
people's point of view, are likely to
become absorbed in their own aims
and ambitions. Particularly is this
the case with students. The pres-
Hure and straining of University life,
the constant putting forward of in
dividual ambition tend to force one
into narrow ruts and to encourage
â–º elf-love. Doubtless much of the
inertia of Stanford social life is duo
to this individual selfishness. Peo
ple form iui'row circles, and have
(.either the regard for others nor the
self-sacrifice to interest themselves
in persons outside their own partic
ular sets. No amount of railing at
the "chilly social atmosphere" will
be effective until individuals over
come this spirit of narrow exclusive
lIOSS.

Draughting students are com
plaining that there are no curtains in
their working depantrnent. The nun
shining down on the white sheets of
paper causes a blinding glare hurt
ful to the eyes. The gymnasium,
too, is lacking in this respect, and as
the weather gets warmer curtains
will have to b; provided or else the
gymnasium will be as hot as an
oven.
