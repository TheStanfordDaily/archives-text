						Sunday Sermon.

Rev. J. W. Dinsmore prtaehed the
Sunday sermon. His subject was
"God's Thoughts and Man's Thoughts,"
his ti xt, Isaiah, lv, 8.
"My thoughts arc not your thoughts,
neither are my ways jour ways, saith
the Lord. Far as the heavens are
higher than the earth, so are my ways
higher than your ways, and my
thoughts than your thoughts." To is
in the cardinal, iar-reaching utterance
of the Holy Scripture which should
govern all our ideas concerning the truths
of God. There is what is known as
the rational movement started by Kant.
It plucks up the church doctrine of the
inspired scriptures. The Holy Scrip
tures are then treated as the works of
IJacon or Shakspere. This is equiva
lent to saying that God has never given
his divine word. What would happen
if we treated the laws of nature in that
way? The truths of religion are not
contrary to nature, but often above it
and beyond it, and wo should not ex
pect that God's ways can be brought
within man's ranpc ol knowledge.
Certainly this is not, such a world as
commends itself to the best human
judgment. If a man were to make an

earth, would lie make one like this?
Would he make useless swamps and
deserts, extremes of drought and cold,
tracts of land covered with stoned
Would he have ores hidden in the
depths of the earlh? Would he allow
poisonous plants and venomous reptiles
te exist?
As God did not make the world ac
cording to our ideas, he does not govern
it according to our ideas. Destructive
forces are constantly at work. Drought
withers the crops. Floods and earth
quakes are launched upon the earth.
Pestilence steals into the city by night
and visits theinnccent and guilty alike.
How can we justify his ways to men?
He sees ihe end from the beginning and
has a light to do what men have not.
Iteasoa has an all-important place in
religion, and the more thorough and
honest the inquiry, the better it is for
us. Hut we are like children opening
our eyes upon a world of which we
know nothing. The thought of the In
finite cannot lie put into the mind ol
finite man. "Mow we see through a
glass darkly "
Here }ou are today, thus far upou
the wayâ€”tlie way begun in myMery
and ending in mystery. You have
thought about your past, present, and
future. There are thoughts of you in
Heaven. And his thoughts may not
tie your thoughts. But if you learn
that God's ways are not your ways, you
must learn that they are higher than
your wa)s as the heavens are higher
than the earth.
