The interest exhibited in the
events of the first field-day held by
the University, and the excellent
showing made by the participants in
the events, augur well for the future
of track athletics. Our lack of train
ing facilities has been the one thing
that has prevented the University
from taking a place in track athletics
equal to the places gained for foot
ball and baseball. Now, however,
that we have probably the best track
on the Coast, the outlook has be
come exceedingly promising. The
result of hist Friday's exhibition is
very gratifying and encouraging.
The track management and the ath
letes themselves are to be congratu
lated.
