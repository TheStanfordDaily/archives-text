# HILDEDRAND AND HIS LIBRARY.
## An Interview with Dr. Goeble. 
### 
Dr. Goebel was seen this afternoon
l»y a representative of the Daily I'ai.o
Alto in regard to Prof. Ilildebrand
and his library. Some general infor
mation was secured on this subject of
prime importance just n<>w to Stanford
partisans.
Rudolph Ilildebrand was born in
1824 and when quite young was asked
by the Grimm brothers to assist, in the
preparation of their famous dictionary.
He taught in the gymnasium at
Leipsic and afterwards filled the chair
of German languige and literatim; in
tbe University of Leipsio, working
meanwhile on the dictionary, writing
articles which far surpassed those of
the Grimm brothers themselves and
which arc recognized as (lie best in the
the work.
The anniversary of his seventieth
birthday was celebrated here last March
by the University Philological Associa
tion
I'rof. Ij ildcbrand spent fifty years in
collecting the library, which is con
sidered one of the finest collections in
Germany. Its value is so great that
its purchase was fora time considered
by the German government; but in ac
cording to tbe wishes of the family, it
will be allowed to come to America,
The library contains about fifteen
thousand volumes, and while its chief
value is in German literature and phil
ology, it covers a wide range of sub
jects, and its purchase will benefit, not
only alone the German department, but
will be valuable for other study as well
It. is very rich in the older Germanic
literature of the sixteenth, seventeenth,
and eighteenth centuries, Folksongs,
and the writings of Goethe and Schiller.
Three and thirty dictionaries of all
languages aro included, and a library
in itself is devoted to French, English,
Italian, and Spanish literature. There
are alto a number of volumes of Greek
and Latin classics.
To the History department the li
brary will make available a number of
exceedingly valuable works, which it is
now impossible to obtain except in a
collection like the Ilildebrand Library.
The Law department will have the
benefit of the volumes which contain
all the sources of the old Germanic
law.
Full sets of most of the important
periodicals in the line of Germanic
studies and many philosophical works
are also to be found among its treasures.
In *Ihe collection are many books
which are not now available to students
in this country arid which can seldom
be found on the continent.
Nearly all the volumes have been ie
peatedly worked over and annotated by
Ilildebrand himself. These full notes
add greatly to the value of the collec
tion.
The price paid for the library wis
24,000 marks, or about $5500. About

half of tliis sum Dr. Goebel lias secured
by subscriptions in Sun Francisco and
elsewhere, and the remainder is to be
raised by the faculty and students by
voluntary subscriptions.
A committee will probably be ap
pointed to receive subscriptions. If
subscriptions come in rapidly enough,
the library will be here available for use
at the beginning of next semester.
