Many do not yet unci erst and the
details of the attempt being made to
secure the Hildebrand Library. The
main facta are these: Stanford was
given an option on the library by
ilie family of the late Prof. Jlilde
brand of Leipzig, of whom l)r.
(ioebel was once a pupil. The funds
at the command of the University
Library did not permit of its pur
chase by that means. .But, mainly
through the efforts of Dr. Goebel,
the greater part of the necessary
amount has been subscribed by
friends of tlie University, mostly
nuu with a deep love for the Father
land and its literature. Members of
the faculty, especially of the depart
ments most directly interested, have
subscribed liberally, and still more
will doubtless come from tlii-i source.
The Graduate Club has taken it up
and may be trusted to do its part.
And, finally, students whose major
is one of the subjects in which the
library is rich will be asked to circu
late subscription papera among all
the students. Quite a large amount
must be raised by this method if the
library is to be secured, and it is
hoped tlie response will bo liberal.
Never yet in Stanford's history
have the students had such an op
portunity to show that a roul love
for the University actuates them,
that their loyalty to the Cardinal is
more than skin-deep. Those who
love the institution and who have
its present and future prosperity
near to their hearts, will not hesitate
to subscribe in this emergency what
their circumstances will permit.
The opportunity is 0110 of a thous
and. The possession of the llilde
brand Library would at once mako
Stanford known and respected
wherever philology and the Ger
manic and ivotnauce literatures are
studied. It would do more for
Stanford's prestige in this country
than any one thing has yet done
This would become a Mecca, as Dr.
Jordan said last evening, to Amer
ican students of philology.
On this subscription list hangs an
inliuitely more important matter than
a football victory or the completion of
a cinder-track. If the love and loy
alty which is our boast is something
more than a transient efi'ect of ex
citement and enthusiasm, now is the
time to show it.
