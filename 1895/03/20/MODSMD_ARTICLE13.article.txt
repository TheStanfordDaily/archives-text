The union of the Stanford and
Berkeley glee fora seiies of
joint concerts is an omen of good
will between the two great univer
sities of the Paeific slope. Moderate
rivalry between colleges is a good
thing, but it should be a friendly ri
valry. Petty jealousies and bicker
ings are entirely out of place. It i?
to be hoped that the junction of the
cardinal with the blue and gold
marks the beginning of the time
when Stanford and Berkeley will lay
aside their differences and fulfil in
harmony their work of culture and
enlightenment.
