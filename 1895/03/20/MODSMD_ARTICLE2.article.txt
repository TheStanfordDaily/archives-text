# Observations in Sinaloa.
## 
### 
By request Pres. Jordan entertained
a largo audience in the chapel last
night by a description of his experiences
in Mexico during the late holidays. It
will be remembered that he, in com
pany with Mrs. Jordan and several stu
dents from the University, spent some
days in the South studying (isli in their
native, unexplored haunts. The lecture
embraced some of the observations
which he made in the land which he
visited. In substance he spoke as fol
lows :
Sinaloa if) the second state in Mexico
south of Arizona. It is about two
thirds the size of California. Its chief
town, Muzatlan, meaning in Indian
"of the deer," is the largest seaport on
the west coast. It is an attractive place
from the approaches, but within is like
all other Mexican towns. The city is
built on Astillero, an <stuaty, which
furnishes a narrow but deep harbor.
The climate in Mazatlan is the two ex
tremes. The winters are delightful*
no rain, and pleasant sea breezes. In
summer rain falls constantly. It, is said
that California cannot compare with the
winter climate. Our party arrived cn
Christmas, the night of the Natividad,
on which day one of our party found a
new species of fish in the market. It
is now kuown in science as Truchinotus
Culvcri.
In the country about Mazatlan every
road has a custom house where tolls are
paid on all loads going into the cities.
The houses arc made of poles. No fires
are necessary except for cooking. The
two articles of food ure tortillas and
frijoles. The latter are eaten every
uica I.
The people are mixed Indians and
Spanish. They are contented and de
void of fear. They have no poverty,
lor in their want and ignorance they
sleep peacefully. They spend much of
their time in gambling. The greatest
hero is the drawer of the lucky number
in the lottery. There are, however,
some people of culture and education.
In Sinaloa there is but one tax, tax
on industry"! A fruit-stand owned by
a woman on the street corncr pays a tax
of $70 a month. There is no tax on
land if it is not improved. This dis
courages industry and farming. Ten
per cent, of the gross receipts go for
taxes. To balance this drain, a pro
tective tariff is levied. They import
cotton and other articles from the U. S.
Bankruptcy is the ultimate end of such
countries.
In Mazatlan there is no confidence
among tlie people. It ia so among all

Spanish people. The government is
interesting, licnito Juarez, the or
ganizer, was a great man, and built his
government on harsh lines. The elec
tions arc always in favor of the party in
power, and will so remain as long as
the people remain ignorant. The citi
zens take no interest in government af
fairs.
Farming is not prosperous. Sugar
cane is raised. iMuscal is also a pro
duct. The schools in Mazatlan are
compulsory, such as they have. The
church is not conspicuous. The peo
ple were priest ridden, and now the
church is held down by the strong
arm of the state.
The social life of Mexico, such as it
is, is interesting. Dull fighting is in
dulged in, but we witnessed none
while there.
