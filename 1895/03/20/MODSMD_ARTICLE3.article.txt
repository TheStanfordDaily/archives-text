# Dr. Jordan's Latest Lecture to be Repeated in Palo Alto.
## 
### 
Certain residents of Palo Alto liave
formed a club for the puiposc of beau
tifying University avenue. A scries
of entertainments will be given for the
purpose of raising funds. The co-op
eration of all students is asked by the
committee on arrangement, Mrs. J. W
Dayan aud Mrs. Dr. Decker. The
entertainment will occur at Nortree
Hall, April 4, when Dr, Jordan will
speak on "The Woman of Pessimism
and the Woman of Evolution." Con
cerning this lecture, a recent number
of the San Francisco Chronicle has the
following:
The Century Club recognizes David
Starr Jordan as one of its deities.
The best talks ever given before the
club have been emanations from the
Jordan brain and tongue, and the one
on Wednesday was no exception.
The three audience rooms of the
Century Club were thronged with
members and visitors, and so eager
were they to hear that the plumed and
bejewcled hosts actually encroached on
the raised dias where the lecturer
stood.
Even those who had to stand did
not regret it, so interesting were the
charmed and winged words that fell
from the lips of the authority on fishes.
For though it is not generally known,
Dr. Jordan is as much of an authority
on women as he is on fi-hes and bugs,
and, in common with most men, he con
siders women the most interesting of
the trio.
Wednesday's talk had to do with a
man who would not acknowledge his in
terest in women. Schopenhauer, the
woman-hater, was the subject of the
Iccturc, and when Dr. Jordan had fin
ished with the sour old philosopher the
pessimist had not a leg left to stand on.
The subject of the lecture was"The
Women of Schopenhauer and the Wo
men of Evolution." Naturally such a
subject gave an opportunity fora start
ling antithesis of which Dr. Jordan was
not slow to avail himself. lie disap
proves of Schopenhauer entirely, and
painted the women of evolution in glow

ing colorsâ€”the noble ideal toward
which the world is tending.
J>r. Jordan believes in the new
woman, as might] be expected of the
progressive head of a progressive uni
versify, and he sees a bright promise
in the present bubbling unrest. All
the Century Club women do not believe
in the new woman, but they were fain
to look upon her with favor when she
was sketched for them with such en
thusiasm and backed by such high au
thority.
For over an hour the lecturer held
them spell-bound, and no one so much
as whispered.
