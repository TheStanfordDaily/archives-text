						Combination an Assured Success. 
### 
Great interest is being manifested iu
San Francisco in the coucert to be given
there on Friday evening, March 29, by
the Mandolin Club and the Berkeley
Glee Club. A number of society peo
ple have become interested in the mat
ter. and this together with the extensive
advertising that is being done has made
the success of the concert assured. Mr.
hove, the manager of Scheel's Auditor
ium, where the concert is to be given,
is working up the affair in a thorough
manner. lie has sent out 5000 printed
letters, besides billing the city with
large posters, and placing window-cards
and photographs of the two clubs iu
the most prominent stores.
The sale of seats and the interest
manifested on all sides in the coucert
liave demonstrated that the combination
is a desirable one. The faculties of
the two universities have given it their
unqualified endorsement. Dr. Jordan
has expressed himself as pleased with
the idea, and thinks that it will foster a
desirable spirit between the universi
ties.
The Mandolin -Club will appear at
the concert with a complete set of new
instruments of the best manufacture.
A number of the mandolins are from
the famous Italian maker, Salsedo, and
ihe other mandolins and the guitars are
from the house of Henry L. Mason of
Boston. The instruments are valued at
nearly $000 This acquisition will
make the club one of the best fitted out
mandolin clubs in America.
The clubs are working hard in prep
aration for the concert, and it is safe to
siy that both will appear in better con
dition than ever before. The IJ. C.
Glee Club has prepared some especially
attractive pieces, and Mr. Chas. Parcells
of Berkeley will play one of his violin
milos for which he is becoming so favor
ably known. The Mandolin Club will
render a mazurka, "Kstudiautina Ital
•ana," wbich has become a favorite of
mandolin clubs in Italy, and which will
be given for the first time in this coun
try. An innovation in the way of a
mandolin quartet is to be made. The
piece to be given is Alfred I'ester's
"Im Fruhling" (Op. 12, no. 1). C. K.
