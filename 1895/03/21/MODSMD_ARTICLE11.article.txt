The Association of Collegiate Alum
nae is sending out circulars to its mem
bers reviewing the work done by
American women in German univer
sities since those institutions have been
open to women. The account as given
is most interesting and encouraging.
There are in Germany five institutions
which have admitted American women.
Berlin, Heidelberg, Leipsic, Strassburg,
and Gottingen; and Zurich, which is
practically German; though all except
Zurich restrict them more or less.
During the winter semester of 1894
there were fifteen women hearing lec
tures at Gottingen, most of them in math
ematics, astronomy, and physics.
Eleveu of these women are American,
three English, and ouly one German.
None of the universities grant degrees
to women except Heidelberg, which
has promised to give Miss Ida Ilyde of
Cornell, the Ph. D. degree when the
regular conditions are fulfilled; and
Zurich, which last year granted the
same decree to Miss Julia Snow, of
Cornell, — harvard Daily News.
