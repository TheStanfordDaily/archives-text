The news that football has been
finally abolished at Harvard comes
to the college world with a shock.
When the announcement was made
a few weeks ago that the Har
vard faculty was considering the ad
visability of such action, it was never
dreamed that such radical measures
would he taken. At the most it was
thought that the game would be so
modified as to admit of its being
played at Harvard during the com
ing season. The action taken, how
ever, sounds the death knell of the
game at Harvard. It will be hard
to estimate the final effect of such ac
tion upou football throughout the
country, but that it will diminish
the popularity of the game there can
be no question. Harvard is known
as pre-eminently a progressive insti
tution, and its action will therefore
have considerable influence. Yale
has played one of her most promi
nent games each year with Harvard,
and no game next season with Har
vard will materially diminish the in
terest in the game r at Yale. Penn
sylvania has looked upon her game
with Hurvard as the climax of the
season, and the unauimous opinion
there is that the action means death
to football at Pennsylvania.
Undoubtedly the action will
throw a damper cn football through
out the entire country. Coming
from Harvard, one of the first col
leges in the country to introduce the
game, and where it has been care
fully fostered and improved each
year, it will carry great weight with
it. The effect upon the Pacific Coast
will probably not be as immediate as
the effect in the East, but the influ
ence of the action will be felt in no
small degree.
When one comes to consider the
arguments for and against football,
it is hard to understand why the
Harvard faculty was led to such
radical action. It is possible that
the rules of the game cau be so
changed as to do away entirely with
the objectionable features. Still the
action of Harvard must not be
thoughtlessly condemned. The prob
lem has been a serious one, and a
large and intelligent body of men
has decreed that football is not a
proper college sport.
