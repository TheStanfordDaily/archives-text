It seems to be settled that Berke
ley's athletic team will take the pro
posed trip Eist. While we may not
approve of such a step on account of
the heavy expenses involved, and the
disadvantages with which Berkeley
must cope, the efforts put forward
by the Olympic Club to make the
trip a success are in the right direc
tion. The interests of the Pacific
Coast will be in Berkeley's hands,
and aid and encouragement should
be given by all the athletic clubs and
colleges on the Coast.
