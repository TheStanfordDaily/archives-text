From the list published on the first
page of this issue, some more defin
ite idea of great value of the Hilde
brand Library to the various depart
ments of the University cau be gained.
From the circumstances attending
the attempt to secure it, the idea has
become prevalent that but little
benefit from it would accrue to any
but the German department. How
far from the truth this is cau be seen
by reference to this list. Of course
the German department will get the
lion's share of its riches. Yet the
departments of English, History,
Ethics, Education, Law, Latin,
Greek, and possibly others will de
rive inestimable benefit from it.
Students especially whose majors
are in these departments should not
hesitate to help in its purchase. For
example, the History student whose
ideal is higher than merely getting
the necessary thirty hours' credit
can appreciate how immediately he is
interested when he learns that in the
Hildebrand Library are many vol
umes of great value to the historian,
and which can scarcely be purchased
elsewhere at any price. The same
applies to other departments.
Self-interest, aside from college
loyalty, should lead many to come
to the help of those who are woik
ing so earnestly and so comiueud
ably in this matter.
