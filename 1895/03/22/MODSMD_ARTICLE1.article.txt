# Amendments to the By-Laws of the Athletic Committee.
## 
### 
At the next meeting of the Athletic
Committee the following rules, which
were lately adopted by the committee,
will be proposed as amendments to the
by-laws.
(1) All managers' reports shall be
iimde on thesis paper.
(2) The president and the treasurer
of the student body and the manager of
the team concerned shall constitute a
committee to receive bids and to let
contracts for the supplying of athletic
goods for each team.
(3) No manager shall expend any
money, or incur any liabilities without
first receiving the consent of the Ath
letic Committee.
The object of (1) is that tlie reports
may be bound and filed for future use.
The object of (2) is to prevent the
managers from purchasing their goods
where their personal feeling, and pos
sible, opportunity for profit, may dictate.
The object of Qi) is that the committee
may know approximately how much
money is being spent, and where it is
going before it goes. I his rule of
course does not mean that the com
mittee must dircct the expenditure of
each nickel. It means that when a
manager wants (according to his own
estimate) twenty-five dollars for per
sonal expenses or ยง100 for hotel bills
or $200 for suits, etc., he must let the
committee know it.
