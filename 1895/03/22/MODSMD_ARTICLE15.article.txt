rings merrily in the ears of us all—
even in those of the chronic "dig,"
to whom vacation means nothing
but a little more time lor intellectual
"stuffing." It is a sign of deteri
oration in people that the older they
get, tho fewer vacations they use in
real recreation. To be busy is un
doubtedly the only way to be happy,
yet it is well to know how to rest and
how to play. Economics, if nothing
else, would suggest that we use va
cation as a time to rest and read and
enjoy ourselves, so that we may take
up our work anew, not with las iitude,
but with buoyancy and interest.
It is worth while, too, to spend a
little time on our friends. In nine
short weeks our friends will scatter,
and the old relations can never be
quite the same. Let us, then, devote
some little time to pure friendship
and affection, that we may look back
on our college days as the sweetest
and simplest of our life
