# No Freshman Baseball at Yale.
## 
### 
At a meeting of the freshman division
of the Yale faculty it was voted to pro
hibit the members of the freshman
class from taking any part in baseball
during the coming season. This shuts
dfl' the two aunual Yale-Harvard games,
and prohibits freshmen from training
lor the varsity team. The faculty has
had the obnoxious action of the fresh
men at the Junior Glee Club concert
under consideration for Forae time.
The cause for the punishment is that
nearly the whole freshman class
gathered in the top gallery of the
Hyperion Theatre on the evening of
the Junior Glee Club coucort. They
not only suspended a banner bearing
the class numerals, but showered cards
upon the audience below and drowned
out the voiccs of the singers with their
chcers. The punishment would prob
ably not have been so severe had not
a member of the faculty visited the
gallery and been guyed by the students.
The class of '96 were punished simi
larly for si disturbance created in a
theatre during the freshman year.â€”Ex.
