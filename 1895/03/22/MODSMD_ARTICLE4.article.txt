# In Memory of Balfour Anderson.
## 
### 
At the sanitarium in San Francisco,
Wednesday, March 20th, Balfour Von
Vleck Anderson, oldest son of J'rot.
Melville Anderson, ceased to suffer.
Stanford friends knew Balfour as a
quiet, gentle, intellectual boy whose
delicate health prevented him from en
joying many of the pleasures of youth.
Previous to his coming to California,
however, he was a strong, vigorous lad,
noted as much for his physical as for
his mental ability. A few days after
their arrival, two years ago, Balfour and
his sister were attacked with rheuma*
tism, which caused the death of the
latter and a permanent heart trouble in
the former. Deprived of the exercise
which had formed so large a part of his
life in Germany, Balfour resignedly
took up gentler pleasures. His talent
in painting and music was cultivated to
his utmost strength. His intellect was
strangely clear and strong for so young
a boy. With insatiable yearning, he
read all of the English classics.
In Germany, when very young, he
mastered the German language and
studied mathematics, literature, and
philosophy, keeping pace with the nat
ive boys.
In the death of Balfour Anderson,
we see perish the sweetest hope and
ambition of his parents' life. It is vain
to offer trite expressions of condolence.
The many firm friends of Prof, and
Mrs. Anderson can only offer, as a
poor substitute for that which is lost to
them, the deep and friendly sympathy
which makes the whole world kin.
The funeral services were conducted
this afternoon by Dr. Thoburn, and
Balfour was laid to rest by his sister's
side in the beautiful Stanford cemetery.
