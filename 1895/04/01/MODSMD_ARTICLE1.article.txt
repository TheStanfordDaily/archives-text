# U. C.-STANFORD CONCERT.
## The 						First United Effort a Great Success. 
### 
No greater compliment could have
been paid to the two universities than
ilie appearance of such an audience at
their concert in San Francisco last Fri
day Scheel's Auditorium never
had so large or so select an audience
before It was composed of San Fran
cisco's representative people.
The concert was also a success musi
cally Our hoys might he criticized
for t v ieir lack of unity, however. In
all club playing individuality should he
entirely eliminated.
The quartette "Iin Fruhling" was a
little gem. It was very unfortunate
tint Sewall'd string should break just
then. However, he was so cool about
it that very few people noticed it.
The selection of the Mandolin Club
which was most heartily received was
perhaps the ''Polish Dance," which was
rendered very well indeed.
The U. 0. Glee Club did well. Al
though their individual voices arc not
remarkable, they have found the true
j«rt in chorus work; they sing together,
and modulate well The parts are very
nicely balanced, too, the weakest point
io the Club being in the first has*. In
une of their selections the first bass was
woe'ully off ihe key. "My Old Ken
tucky Home" made everybody forget
any previous mistakes. It was beauti
fully sung.
Mr. (Mias. E. l'arcells wa* not up to
his usual form. It is possible he tried
something a little too difficult in Musin's
''Capiice de Conceit.'' Although he
did very well, we have heard him do
better.
Dr. Graham, U. 0. soloist for the
evening, has a beautiful tenor voice of
a sweet, clear <]uality—not a very heavy
voice, lie was "enthusiastically en
cured. He seems to be rather new at
the business; his presence could
be improved a good deal.
That which carried the house by
storm was Field's soprano solos. He
earricd off the honors of the evening by
a large majority. His trills and semi
demi quavers were very amusing, and at
the same time musically very good
Many a professional impersonator would
have been green with envy on hearing
him.
Taking every thing together, honors
were equally divided between the two
universities. At the end of the last
number, the boys turned in and gave
the college yells with a hearty good
will Shirley Pakeii.
