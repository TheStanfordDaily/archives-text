# The 						Remenyi Concert.
## 
### 
It is unfortunate that the llemenyi j
Company chose an evening in vacation
for their appearance here. The chapel
was not more than half filled on JMon-1
Jay evening, but those who were at the j
University and attended the concert I
enjoyed a very pleasant evening's enter- j
tainment.
In llemenyi may be f'ouud a good ;
deal that smacks of charlatanry and a j
defiance of much that is right in
method. Hut mingled with all this
there is a touch of that indefinable
something that is possible only to the j
musician pure and simple. Ilis first j
number was a fantasia on the "Ilugue-j
nots." Spectacular, vulgar, and blatant j
as Myerbeer's music is, these qualities
were emphasized by llemenyi. Many :
of them were interrupted merely for the j
purpose of making a display of virtu-j
osity in its baser phase —that of tech
nique. The graceful pizzicati from
"Sylvia" was also marred in a similar
manner. The "Hungarian Pastorale"
is one of the least satisfactory of those
compositions of llemenyi in which he
is so successful as an interpreter of the;
conspicuous national element. lle
menyi's best work was done in Gounod's
"Ave Marie," arranged as an ensemble
fur the voice, piano, and violin. In
this he gave the noble and majestic S
theme with a rhythmical accentuation
of the crescendo, and a lyric intensity j
of expression that was admirable.
Amoug other numbers Mr. Henry
Kumes played a mazurka by Goddard
and a minuet by Bizet, both of which
depend for their interest upon workman
ship and delicate values in the adjust
ment of shading. Mr. Eames possesses j
facility, and the musical sense in con j
-iderable measure, and he delivers what j
. .
will in time ripen into a broad, open !
tone. His technique, sufficiently dis- ■
linctive, is of the modern school and '
aims well His performance gave evi
dence of Jin esse and individual concep- i
112 ion.
Miss Pauline Stein possesses a light :
mezzo-soprano of a uot particularly dis- i
agreeable timber, and sings with a
method that is variable.
