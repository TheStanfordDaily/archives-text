# Yesterday's Sermon
## 
### 
Mrs. Lila Frost Sprague, pastor of
the Second Unitarian church of Sun
Francisco, preached the sermon Sun
day, taking as her subject 'The King
dom Within."
The air is now full of theories for
the regeneration of society. ()»e would
think that all this energy and enthusi
asm would bring about radical changes,
but the world seems to move with its

; same old pace. It behooves us to ask
if we are not retarding growth by going
in the wrong direction. The fault is
1 that there is too much materialism. It
is a material kingdom lor which we are
striving. We lind few who stop by the
; wayside to breathe and pray. It is bet
ter far to be able to appreciate the little
patch of blue sky through the garrret
window, or to enjoy the-songs of the
birds in the field, thau to live well but
| with deadened senses. Better the sen
i sitivc heart than the empty hand
The same unhealthy inner light may
exist in different circumstances. Our
philanthropists say, ''See how we have
purified the slums." Far be it from
' me to object to this, but are the drunken
| sober, the profane reverent? No, these
; poor souls have only bidden themselves.
Not until we have recognized God's
; laws shall our efforts be attended with
anything but failure. The kingdom ol
God is not bought and sold. Yet if we
I find one miserable we begin to dole out
; coin, but his life is no less wretched
than before. There is something, not
easily put into words, that he needs.
Will a turbulent crowd be (juieted when
you throw them bread? Better repeat
the words of Aurora Leigh, "The Christ
comfort you," though you leave their
hands empty. There are sad child
faces in the alleys. To arou-e them to
affection would be better than supply
ing raiment.
It is strange that we have such a mis
apprehension of what happiness is.
Ownership does not bring joy. This
dependence on external things for our
happiness is useless. It nourishes dis
contented thoughts and undisciplined
j feelings. It is found amid wealth as
i well as poverty. Think that the wo
man attired in all her finery is con
tented? Are her ears open to uo evil
voice? To watch the blossoms open, to
see the sun set and rejoice, and to re
joice in the nearness of God in all
things—is this to be bought? Build
first in the heart of man. Will it take
any louger than the way we have tried?
Carlylc says we have been tryiug to
drag God down to us when it is his law
that we should rise to him.
Am I forgetting that to bear one
another's burdens is the law of love?
j No, but a load cannot be lifted by a
hand of flesh. There is a prayer on
| the pages of fiction: "For the weak and
sinful, oh Lord, we pray; lor the
weary and heavy-laden, oh Lord, we
j pray; for those who have no one to share
j their grief, oh Lord, we pray; teach
them to tell thee when the night is
■ long." There are some who] believe in
|no God. You cannot choose but be
lieve something. We are trying to
build a kingdom of love out of bricks
j and mortar. Hut some day God will
call to us and that which is material
will no longer have power over us.
There we will be content to raise men's
1 souls as God has done.
