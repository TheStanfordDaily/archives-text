The Briggs/Jrub Club gave a dance j
and card party at Mariposa Hall a week I
ago Friday. Some refreshments were j
served and an enjoyable time was had
by all who attended.
Such music lovers as were on the
campus attended the ltemenyi concert
last Monday evening. Some improve
ment was noticed in the number of
young women who did not wear their
hats, but this admirable custom is not
yet sufficiently in vogue. Those who I
eschew drees-reform in other ways
might at least give this a judicious j
trial.
On Tuesday night the Roble gym
nasium was made attractive fora va
cation dance. Encina gymnasium is
resting before the great excitemeut of
Pinafore. This pleasant aflair was
successfully arranged by Misses Jones,
Vineyard, and McLaughlin, and an
enjoyable event of last smminer was
repeated.
Another informal dance given in the
Roble parlor on Thursday evening was
enjoyed by about seventeen couples.
The music was good but the lemouade
was deploiably weak.
Mrs. J. M. Stillman entertained
Misses Jones, Hays, Crow, Ilerrick,
Kate Herrick, and Steffens at dinner
on Friday evening.
On Saturday evening an impromptu
dance was given at the Zeta Psi house.
