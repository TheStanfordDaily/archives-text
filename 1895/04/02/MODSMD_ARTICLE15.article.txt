This month promises to be one of
the most interesting in the history
of the University from a social and
atlileiic standpoint. Two hops, l'in
afore, tenuis and baseball, Junior
diy, a piano recital, two intercolleg
iate debates, our first field day, the
intercollegiate field-day, and a com
bination concert have all been
crowded into April. From the
standpoint of study this is unf'ortun
ate. A great part of the events
could easily have been arranged for
some other month, or what is better,
they could have been sprinkled
throughout the semester. The tend
ency is to put off all important
events until April, aud consequently
University work is made to suffer.
During the first months of both se
mesters there is a dearth of social
life, though there is no necessity for
this being the case.
Those who have charge of arrang
ing the dates for college events
should profit by the experience of
this year, aud make a more satisfac
tory program for the coming year
