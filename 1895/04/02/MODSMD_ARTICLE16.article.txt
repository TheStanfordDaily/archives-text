The Junior Farce will be pre
sented on the afternoon of April 26
The furco writer is Surah Comstoek,
'9(5. Her farce is characteristic of
college life, full of amusing compli
cations and harmless satire â€”just the
kind of a sketch to make the after
noon of Junior Day one of the year's
pleasant events. The parts have
been carefully cast, and rehearsal
work will commence at once. The
task of getting up the senior and
junior farces becomes more and more
difficult with the succeeding pre
cedent of each year, and careful re
hearsing is necessary to equal the
cuceoss of the previous productions.

It would be well for ilie managers of
tbis year's farces to pay some atten
tion to stage fittings. The sjjectac
ular effects of the vaudeville produc
tion could only be tolerated at an
affair of that kind, and peihaps
never again. The coming produc
tion of Pinafore will spoil all of us
for hhakuperean stage-settings.
But after all, the local element in
these 01 plays is the main
feature, aud good local hits will
carry a farce bravely. Let the jun
iors keep on the watch for good
material, tfet up a local song or two,
and with features added to the
merit of Miss Comstock's farce, the
affair will go down to ,( .)7 as a bard
precedent to beat.
