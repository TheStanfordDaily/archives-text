It was thought and earnestly
hoped thiit the completion of a first
class cinder track would be induce
ment enough to draw a large number
of athletes out to train for the inter
collegiate games. Although this
important event is only ten days in
the future, not a dozen men could
have been counted upon the track at
any one time eince its completion.
The captain, manager, and trainer
have repeatedly exerted themselves
to get out new material, but there is
no spirit aud the flesh is weak —yes,
worse than weak —it has reached
that unwholesome aud shameful
stage of stagnancy where it will sit
idly by, and, calloused to all the
finer feeliugi of patriotism, witness
a repetition of the inglorious, hu
miliating, and degrading defeats
which have been our lot in track
athletics for the past two years. If
half the available athletic material
in this institution would do its duty
there would be no fear for the out
come, But, blind to the pressing
need for their services and recreant
to their alma mater, a few laggards
have elected to draw down upon us
stinging defeat where thfiy might
have heralded a crowning victory.
Yet we will not give up without a
struggle, aud even at this date
there is a chance for more thau one
man to gain a place on the athletic
team which is to be sent against
Berkeley next week. The standard
of proficiency which may be seen in
another column is unusually low,
and it is made so intentionally in
order to induce second and third
place men to try for the team. A re
cent field-day in San Francisco dem
onstrated the fact that Stanford has
a good hold on her share of first
medal placej, but without a large
number of men entered for the
other places it will be impossible
to make even a good showing against
the large list of athletes which will
represent the blue and gold. If
you have no spikes, borrow a pair
aud try hard this week to come up
to the fixed standard in some event;
at leapt try.
