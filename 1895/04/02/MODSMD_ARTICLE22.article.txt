Concerning the question of the future
of iootball at Harvard, the following
letter from Harvard's captain is full of
interest. Its manly tone must have
made the faculty almost doubt the wis
dom of their action. Captain Brewer
is a shining proof of the essential man
liness of the sport.
To the Editors of the Crimson:
Whether last evening's vote of the
faculty is wise or uot is to be seen in
future years; whether they have really
acted towards the prosperity of our be
loved college remaiLS yet to be proved.
For the present at least the deed is
done, and as we think, perhaps, one of
our most manly spcrts has been torn
from us. But are we actually in a
position to question the wisdom of this
action? Stop a moment and think.
Do we, as undergraduates only iu this
college, consider that we can judge
with that judgment that comes from
experience? Is it not better to trust
to the foresight of our elders in experi
ence at least? Surely they realize the
importance of the step they have
taken, and are willing to accept the
rasult, which they must sincerely be
lieve will be only to our advantage,
is it not most discourteous to the fac
ulty, our intended benefactors, it we
tear to pieces their opinions, and criti
cize them piecemeal—we, only under
graduates who have scarcely reached
our tweuties ? Surely we are not so
vain as to believe that they carry
enormous weight with them. Let it
be for others to criticize; let it be for
those who justly believe themselves
capable; but let us at least prove our
selves gentlemen, courteous and manly,
A. 11. Brewer.
