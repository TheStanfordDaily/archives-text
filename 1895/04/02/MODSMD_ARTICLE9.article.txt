# Dual Football League.
## 
### 
The critical condition which football
matters have been in recently, on ac
count, of the action of the Harvard
I'aculty, has been most discouraging to
the college world in general and to
Pennsylvania in particular. There can
be no doubt that it Harvard or any oi'
the other lour large colleges gives up
the game it robs the intercollegiate
championship of its interest, and asso
ciation football is practically dead. Yet
no one can decry this late actiou which
has brought about the trouble. Foot
ball between certain colleges has de
veloped into something which does
not deserve the name of athletic sporr,
and all true athletes are ready to see
the crisis past and a change fioni bitter
antagonistic contests to fiieudly tests of
merit and ability.
There is no doubt that every faculty
in the college world realizes that it is
time tor it to take a hand in the matter,
and Harvard was the first to formulate
its plans and do what had become its
inevitable duty. At any rate the Penn
sylvania committee was preparing to
submit resolutions practically the same
as Harvard's to its faculty at the same
time that college announced its pio-
Inhibition of the game. Pennsylvania,
however, is loth to see so noble a sport
die because some col cues cannot refrain
from abusing it, and seeing that she
holds the .same position toward the game
as Harvard, has conceived the idea of a
dual leauue with that college upon these
new lines and under the same rules
which both colleges have adopted as
their attitutc toward the sport. No
intention, however, existed of taking
advantage of the unusually favorable
conditions for such a league caused by
the strained relations of the two col
leges, but only a desire to continue the
game upon the legitimate lines of col
lege sport.
The Pennsylvania faculty committee
intend to push the matter. The com
munication which I hey will send to
Harvard cannot fail to bear great
weight with her faculty, and every one
hopes it may receive a most favorable
reply.
The feeling of the undergraduates at
Cambridge is strongly in favor of t'ie
arrangement, Hrewer and other foot
ball men there received it with en
thusiasm and spoke confidently of its
acceptance. Alumni in Philadelphia
all favor it, but of course the sentiment
of the faculty cannot be definitely
stated. It is the only means of saving
the g : ime, however, and in all probability
a dual league will be formed, and the
game will become a better and nobler
spoitbythe dangerous crisis it has
passed through.— Pennsylvania!).
