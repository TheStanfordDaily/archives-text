Frof. Fairclough gave the regular
Tuesday evening lecture this week io a
fairly large audience. His subject
was"The Ancient and Modern Stage."
After a short review of the condition of
modern drama, he t-poke in substance as
follows:
Divorced from the ephemeial sur
rouudings of the stage most modern
plays arc imbecile to a degree. Trag
edy is no longer popular unless, like
Sardou's "La Tosca," it teems with
visible tortures and bloody horrors.
Burlesque and broad farce have largely
taken the place of lefined comedy.
But the realistic playwright of the day
is not without his champions. Mr.
Beerbohni Tree has made a faint appeal
in his behalf, while 11. I). Traill comes
to his rescue with the most audacious
pleas. Mr. Traill makes the astound
ing statement that literature and the
drama are mutually exclusive forms ol
art. In the Greek drama, in Shakg
pere, and the other great literary
dramatists these are, it is true, com
bined, but they are not fused.
As a poet Shakspere, it seems,
was a success; as a playwright
lie was a failure. His poetry
" intrudes itself," and Macbeth, if
submitted today for the (irst time to
an intelligent and competent staiie man
ager, would have its finest and most re
markable passages scored. All imagin
ative passages, which make visible the
struggling soul within, the manager's
pencil would have erased. How thank
ful we ought to be that Shakspere
was not born in this enlightened age!
Yet the stage of today is not in such a
lamentable condition as many would
have us believe. In the large centers
it, is evident that even the public ate
beginning to grow weary of the imbe
cilities ot the stage and are turning
with renewed delight to that perennial
fount ot intellectual pleasure, the plays
of Shakspere. Today we look to
Henry Irving and his revival of the
haksperean drama for the salvation
of the stage. David Christie Murray
bus been led to prophesy that we are
about to witness a grand renaissance
of the stage.
In view of the dramatic crisis we
have reached today, I have thought it
well to dirt ct your attention to the de
velopment. of the drama in Greece,
and to show how, in its culminating
glories, it was under influences simi
lar to those which made possible the
drama of Shakspere. Less than two
years ago I witnessed a beautiful pro
duction if the "Aiifigone" of Sophocles
at Byrn Mawr College. The enthusi
asm which this play aroused showed
how profoundly a play that was pro
duced twenty.three centuries ago could
affect a critical audience of today. 'I his
was partly because Sophocles was a
poet of genius, writing under inspira
tion, but partly because tin* funda
mental principles of the drama Bre the
same for all ages.
The speaker then described the de

velopment of the Greek drama Item
the early songs and dances t>Â» the
finished productions of yEschylus and
Sophocles, and traced its connection with
t he modern drama. lie showed how
ancient methods both of composition
and production are affecting the drama
of today.
In closing he said: ''The highest
kind of poetry is that in which
the poet's self vanishes and the divinity
seizes his soul. That sphere of poetry
is the dramatic. From this point of
view the world's greatest poets, these
who possess a pure, absolute dramatic
imagination, an imagination which
would seem to exist apart from the in
dividual, are iKschylu*, Sophocles, and
Shakspere, hut the greatest ot these
is Shakspere."
