Owino to the unfortunate illness
of Miss Burke, who was lo sing the
part of Josephine in the Pinafore
production, the management has
l>een obliged to fill the vacancy at
tho last moment with outside talent.
Such an alternative is disappointing
to the so interested in tlie uff-iir, as
their aim was from the beginning to
give an entirely s udent production,
but they are compelled to take this
way of saving the opera from indefi

nite postponement. Under the <-ir
cumstances, any objection from
those less interested is annoying and
uncalled for. No one will be linked
to sing the part who couhl cause un
favorable comment of any kind, and
any objection raised to the intro
duction of a professional singer
must come from those who besides
being thoughtless are displaying a
Puritanism that the world outgrew
some time ago.
