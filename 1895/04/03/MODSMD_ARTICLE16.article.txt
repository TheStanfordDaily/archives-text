The action of the Hifrvard faculty j
in recommending the prohibition of
intercollegiate football was both j
wise and foolish. It wan wise iu that j
Eastern football as exemplified by
this year's Yale-Harvard game, is in
sad need of some reform; foolish in
... i
that the prohibition of the game is J
an extreme measure. There is no
need to recall here the beneficial in
fluence which football ban exerted
over modern college life, or, the
mental, moral, and physical im
provement which has followed its
widespread adoption. The benefits
are apparent, and are recognized
almost universally by progressive
educators, but the Eastern universi
ties have carried the game to an ex
treme. The employment of methods
of training which overtax the
physique of the men, the growth of
an atmosphere which savors strongly ■
of professionalism, and above ail, a I
feeling of excessive arid bitter riv
alry, prove that eastern interest in
the game has reached an unhealthy
point.

greatest of outdoor games, should be
kept from degenerating into a species
of mimic warfare carried on with all
the trickery and bitterness of actual
battle.
