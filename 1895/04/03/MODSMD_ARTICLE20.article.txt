# Princeton and the U. of P.
## 
### 
There now seems to be some possibil
ity that Pennsylvania and Princeton will
meet upon the football field in Novem
ber next, notwithstanding the recent de
cision of the Priueeton faculty's ath
letic committee to prohibit for the time
being all contests between the students
of the two institutions. A number of
Princeton men have been in Philadelphia
this week", and from this source it was
learned that the members of the last sea
son's football team have been united in
petitioning the faculty to consent to a
game with Pennsylvania next fall. This
iictiou was taken at the instanco of
Oapt. Lea, who h anxious to have an
opportunity of ofF->etting the defeat of
Princeton by Pennsylvania at Trenton
last fall.
It is believed that if the influential
graduates of Princeton should join
with the football team in asking fur a
reconsideration of the faculty's decision,
the faculty would allow the game to be
played.â€” Crimson.
