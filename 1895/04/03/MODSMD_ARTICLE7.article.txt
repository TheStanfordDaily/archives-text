# Walter Camp on the Football Situation.

### 
In an interview Walter Camp re
cently expressed his views on the foot
ball situation as follows:
I was both surprised and disap
pointed on hearing that the Harvard
faculty had again reported adversely
about the sport, 1 know that there
has been a feeling that perhaps some
action ought to have been taken in
December or January regarding the
rules, but I did not return from the
West until the middle of December,
and the illness of both my father and
mother prevented my taking any active
part or even any interest in football or
college matters. lam quite sure, from
the letters I have received from gradu
ates of all the colleges, that there is
plenty of confidence among them that
the spoit is a worthy one.
I was not present at the big Eastern
matches this last year, but the matches
throughout the country, with the ex
ception ot the Springfield game, seemed
to go off admirably, with plenty of good
feeling and lessening of the number of
accidents, lu fact, the coaches told ine
on my return, that the number of acci
dents for the bcason on the Yale team
was considerably less than usual. 'The
coaches on both teams in tlvs disastrous
game evidently made the mistake, on
the one hand of sending men into the
game who had been already crippled in
practice, and on the other hand of al
lowing themselves tote persuaded by
the pluck of an injured player to allow
him to continue after he should have
been sent to the side lines.
A year ago last winter I became
thoroughly convinced that the amount
of time devoted to this sport was be
coming too great, and I so stated at a
smoke.talk which I gave before the
Sf. Botolph Club in Boston, where the
Harvard team and coaches were present
As soon as I had finished t went ovei
to Capt Emmons and proposed, on be
half of Yale, that he should agree with
Capt Hinkey to do away with summer
practice, but I was unable to persuade
him to do this I know that he is now
reported to be in favor of this, and am
sorry it was not done then.
As our method of management at
Yale is HiflVrent front that, at Harvard,
it is difficult, to say just how such a situ
ation as theirs may eventually result.
I he entire management here lies in the
hands of the captain and manager of
the team, though the faculty could at
any time forbid the sport. lam simply
an adviser, with no official connection,
save that of delegate to the Advisory
Committee of the Intercollegiate Foot
ball Association. As a member of that
committee, I am anxious to assist, as
much as I can, the further improve
ment of the rules, and I hope most, sirir
cerely that the University Athletic
Club will take up the matter, and that
the conference they may call will re
sult, with the help of Harvard, Penn
sylvania, and Princeton, in the modifi
cation of the objectionable features
which, according to all accounts, must
have cropped out, at Sprinufield.
