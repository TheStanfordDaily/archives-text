# In Port.

11. M. S. Pinafore, with Sir 11.
Connick at the helm, arrived in port
safely this afternoon amid the waving
of flags and the tiring of cannon, making
quite an unwonted stir, although the
laculiy has been doing considerable
firing of late. The Daily Palo Alto
immediately dispatched a reporter to
the sea wall to gain what information
he could of the distinguished visitors.
liy the water's edge he found the
fair Ann Finger, who offered him a
seat in her boat and rowed him out to
the great ship. The officers and crew
received him kindly and showed him
around the splendidly appointed vessel.
No more completely equipped craft ever
failed into Gymnasium Harbor: every
thing is up to date, from the electric
lighting to the suits of the crew, which
are only paralleled by the liew '95
sweaters.
The crew, though somewhat weary
alter their long and troublesome voy- I
»ge of two months, are in fine trim for.
their «rand exhibition drill on Friday
»nd Saturday. The reporter heard
them singing together as they woiked
around the deck and iu the ringing.
>■ time of the crew pulled the different
ropes witn that skillful motion notice
able in class elections. In the midst of
this pleasant chorus a sensation was
created by the bouncing entrance of j
Little Buttercup, a plump and pleasing'
person who circulated among the crowd I
ol sailors with the same financial suc
cess that makes the class assessment
collector's life so full of joy. This pop
ular dame is not the only "mystic lady"
connected with maritime life, for the
captain's daughter hts been keeping
the crew in a state of subdued excite
ment by her unexplained absence. All
were somewhat relieved when they
heard that the detective had discovered j
the fair Josephine in the city being i
measured fora voice, which will prob
ably be smoothed and polished up bril
liantly in time for the festival on board.
Sir Joseph is already in port, atix- |
ious and impatient as his careful drawl
will permit, to inspect the bark and !
with swelling pride proclaim himself
monarch of all he surveys. The mon
ocle through which lie performs this
operation he finds difficulty in retaining I
in its place while teaching Captain i
Corcoran to dance the hornpipe on the I
dinner-table, a feat which the reporter
was permitted to witness. Still, that, I
Sir Joseph considers a trifle compared
to keeping military order and discipline!
amongst flitting sisters, delighted cons-1
ios, and excited aunts. When our re-J
porter fiisr, saw him he was ordering the |
marines to teach them the sileut in »n- j
ual, with startling results. These'
marines, by the way, are the famous I
clues of six trained by that distin
guished officer Lieutenant Clam, and
they are now residing in his palatial
i esidence.
The captain was found frying to sat
isfy his crew after his recent engage
ment., and singing to the moon with a

wealth of feeling and aplouib only to bo
produced by years of moonlight, sere
nades to the Roble stars. While our
reporter was watchiug one high official
scale the rafters and escape through
the gallery window he was startled by
being addressed by a serious-laced
sailor who tried to make him believe
that he was not a villian but a hero, and
who took a pessimistic view of life. lie
said that he was accustomed to shuffling
the deck and to acting the top gallant
and that he felt that this trip bordered
close on a tragedy, "l do my best to
get these impressed seamen to stick to
their key, but I fear Sir Joseph's song
has excited them to a frenzy of exag
gerated self-respect that will not close
till they arc fronted by the spectre of a
dungeon cell. It is a strange world!'
Just then in walked the boatswain
and his mate and encouraged Ralph to
action, begging him to mop his brow,
scour the e-'s, holyston the Sophomoro
Cotillion pigeons iu the hatchway, and
be careful about leavfng tacks in the
wake of the vessel lest the admiral be
aroused, llalph arose to perform his
numerous tasks with one hand clutch
ing his aching heart and with the other,
iu spite of his base upholders, keeping
the even tenor of his way on the high
C's.
In Gymnasium llaibor itself there is
considerable dock athletic furniture ly
ing to, but official personages are pad
ding about with skulls, and as soon as
the captain ships a salvage, those timb
ers will be shivered and the bark will
successfully cross the bar, 'I he deck
is now cleaned for action, the libraries
have donated Volumes of sound, the
electric bolls have started ringing ap
plause, the captain's gig will he pro
pelled by Alvarado ltow, and Pinafore
will he to the iront at each stage ol the
pi oeeedings.
The visitors are to be seen all about
the quad , and tlicy are ready for to
morrow night to welcome ladies, yes,
and gentlemen too, most politely. To
misquote a favorite term of Sir Joseph,
the reporter begs to say to the public,
"Pray patronize them; pray patronize
them."
