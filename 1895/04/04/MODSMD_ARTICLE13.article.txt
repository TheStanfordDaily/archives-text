The Cycle Club has decided to
give a road luce next Saturday, and
as the time of handing iu the names
of those who will participate in the
iace has been ixtended only until
tomorrow noon, it is important that
those who intend to enter tlie race
handjin their names at once. For many
reasons it is especially desirable that
this first race by tlie club be made a
(success, and the only way that this
can bo done is fora large number of
men to enter the race. Hand in
your name by all means.
