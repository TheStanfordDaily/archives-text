Those appointed to solicit sub
scriptions for the Hildebrand li
brary are proceeding with the gieat
est difficulty. Individuals are deplor
ably slow in making contributions.
So far only a very small per cent, of
tho sum expected from the students
lias been promised.
This tendency shows a spirit
which is both short-sighted and self
ish. These rtudents whose line of
woik lies in subjects covered by the
library will be amply repaid for the
expenditure of a lew dollars to se
cure it for Stanford. It is not
enough for them to argue that the
library will be procured whether or
not they contribute to the fund; it
is their duty to tho Universiiy and
to themselves to do all in their
power toward tho pmohaeo of this
valuable collection

The charity ball management
made a t?reat mistake in fixing ihe
date cf that event. The intercol
legiate debate occur.-* on the tight
of April 20tli and nothing should be
allowed to detract from ihe interest
in it. The debate is certainly one
of the most important inttrcol!egiate
contents of the yeur. Stanford's
past record in this field has been
glorious Another victory on the
20ih will, in the eyes of many, be
equal at least in importance to the
football vicioiyof lust Thanksgiving,
and will do much to offset probable
defeats in other lines.
But the effect of numbers and en
thusiasm is as great in forensic con
tests as in athletics. If our repre
sentatives are to appear at their best,
they must receive our hearty sup.
port. A bull -the same night, if
enough interest in it is aroused to
make it at all successful, will prevent
many from hearing the debate. By
all means let ihe date of tlie chaiity
ball be changed, that no one may be
compelled to choose between
pleasure and charity on the one hand
and loyalty to the University ou the
other.
