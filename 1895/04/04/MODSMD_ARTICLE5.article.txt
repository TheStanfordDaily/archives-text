# Change in Berkeley's Tennis Champions.
## 
### 
MoChesney, Berkeley '90, who won
first place in the U. C. tournament
last, Saturday, will not be able, on ac
count of the pressure of his studies, to
play in the intercollegiate tournament,
next Saturday. Gage, ' ( J7, who, it will
be remembered, played against Paul
Ellis in last year's intercollegiate meet,
will take his place. This leaves the
other place among the Berkeley retire
sentatives still open. Magee and
llendeisoii will play a match tomorrow
to decide who will meet Picher the
next morning.
