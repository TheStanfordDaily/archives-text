### 
The list of Stanford entries for tlie
intercollegiate Field-day, which Captain
Browu will hand in to the Berkeley
captain tomorrow, will be substantially
as given below. Some additions may
be made, but at most only two or three.
The men whose names appear in this
list have either equalled in private
trials the requiied records as published
in the Daily Palo Alto, or have well
substantiated records equal to those of
the schedule.

Woodward, '95, Carter, '98, Knovvles,
'96.
2-0-Yard Dash — Bernard, '9G,
Woodward, '95, Knowles, '96

<i II Buzzard,'9o.
880-Yard Hun—Copeland, '95,
Brown, 97.
Mile llun—Copeland, '95, Brown,
'97, Fry, '95.
120-Yard Hurdle Race—Culver, '96.
220-Yard Hurdle Race—ll Reynolds,
'90, Culver, '97
High .1 ump—Toombs, 90, II Bey
nolds, '90.
Broad Jump —Culver, '97, M .John
son, '98
Pole Vault —Culver, '97, Dole, '98.
Hammer Throw—Fickcrt, '07, Wat
son, '95, G It Buzzard, '90.
Shot Put—Watson, '95, Orcutt, '95,
Field, 90

Two-Mile Bicycle Race—Frazier,
'08, Roper, '95, third man to be chosen.
By this year's intercollegiate agree
ment a first place will count for five
points, a second for two, and a third
lor one. Before, sceoud place counted
three points; so the total of points in
tins year's meet will be one hundred
arid twelve as against one hundred aud
twenty-six for previous years.
Two years ago Stanford won thirty
live of them to Berkeley's ninety-one,
and last year gained a point, winniug
thirty-six to ninety for the opponents.
This year, if Stanford is to lose no
ground, she must win thirty-two points
to Berkeley's eighty. Any points in
excess of that will be clear gain and a
cause for self-congratulation.
Some of the men are in excellent
condition. The completion of the cin
der track and the excellent work of
Captain Brown and Coach Hunter have
been of inestimable value to local track
athletics. The establishment of a
training table at Encina is another of
this year's innovations, the advantage
of which can scarcely be overestimated.
On the other hand, there is much in
the condition of our team that is dis
couraging. Among the hundred yard
men, Bernhurd was iu fine form until
the Faster vacation, when the grip at
tacked him. With the loss of more
than a week's training and the linger
ing effects of the prip, it is rather un
certain what he will be able to do.
Woodward, who has excellent ability,
has only commenced training since
vacation, and whether he can get in

form by the 13th yet remains to be
seen.
Knowles is doing well in the sprints,
especially in the 220 dash. He can
also be counted on to do well in the
quarter. Copeland will laud fast time
in the half, and it will take better work
than has yet been done on the Berkeley
track this year to keep first place from
him. Brown may also run in this
event. The latter, however, is doing
fast time in the mile and may not be
able to enter both eveuts.
Fry was booked for the quarter, but
an injured leg resulted in his being
placed in the mile run, which he is do
ing iu fairly good form.
We are extremely unfortunate in not
having more entries in many of the
eveuts. Culver is the only Stanford
man to start in the high hurdles. The
slightest accident wou'd lose us several
points in this event, aud a hurdle race
is just where au accideut is likely to
occur.
Dole and Culver will probably take
both places in the pole vault, aud Stan
ford should squeeze several more points
out of the other field eveuts, though
none of our men are doing very high
grade work. Johnson was making good
distance in the broad jump, but a
strained leg may let him out iu the in
tercollegiate contest..
Taking the situation as a whole, our
chauces are about the same as they were
last year aud the year before. In de
creasing the value of second place men,
the advautage has been somewhat for
Stanford. The Berkeley swarm of ath
letes will have the crowd with them and
that will be a great incentive for them
to tiet the medals also.
