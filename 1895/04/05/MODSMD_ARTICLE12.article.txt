The project to construct u boule
vurd from San Francisco to Sau Jose
is one that eliiect'y concerns the Uni
veisily. The proposed route passes
along the foothills back of the quad
rangle, and should this route be
adopted and the road built, the
University would receive immensH
benefit. The importance of good
roads to a community is too well
known to need comment. The plun
of tho proposed boulevard, however,
is especially commendablo, and the
enthusiasm with which the idea has
been received must bo very gratify
ing to the projectors, and to all who
have the advancement of this valley
at heait. It is to be earnestly hoped
that the jn'oject will bo speedily ac
complished.
