Because we havo beaten Berkeley
«t baseball bix out of seven games
during the past iliree years is liable
to inspire an over-confidence in to
morrow's contest which may rtsult
in anything but a satisfactory way
Realizing the unsavory baseball rep
utation which in tlie past was at
tached to the school in the hills, no
paius are being spared this year to
put forth a winning team. Two pro
fessional coaches have been secured,
and those who have seen the team
play predict a losing game for Stan
ford on the morrow. The Berkeley
team has not won a game t'«is year,
hut this has beeu owing to hard luck
and an utter lack of support on the
part of the student body, more than
anything else. They have lost most,
of their games on close scores, and
when a team can put up a two to
three contest against the Olympic
nine at its best, it has established
itself as a very fotmidableantagonist
to our rather unstable aggregation
of ball-tosscrs.
