Tiie first publication of high stanel
iug to tspou e the moi-sback action
of the Haivurd faculty in abolishing
fuotball has been the Nation. But
it is not a supporter that will carry
much weight iu the one sided a gu
ment. A few fallacious arguments
are strongly put forth by a man who
evidently knows little about the
game and far less about college life
iu general. By proudly asserting
that every other institution of Lote
in the countiy will soon follow
Harvard's example, and giving no
proof whatever for the ussertiou,
the Nation will have little or no ef
fect. The p >wcrs be in the ed
ucational institutions throughout
the United States are not going to
be led about by the'nose into taking
any tuch elective actiou just because
the fuculiy at Harvard has done so,
and has done so without reason.
The majority of the faculty and
tvery student at Cambridge, depre
cate the actiern taken, and it is
hjptd that a change in the recent
decision will be made before the full
season opens.
