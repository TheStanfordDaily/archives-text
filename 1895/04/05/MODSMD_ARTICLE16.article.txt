The two dailits at Harvard are
still staunch supporters of the pig
skin. The Crimson says:
The faculty hive at last found a
champion. As was to be expected,
the Action has nothing but approval,
and no hulf hearted approval either,
for their late action. In athletic
mutters at least the Nation does
nothing by halves; so we learn now
that Harvard has saved the cause of
learning fur all the colleges, and will
in a few years earn their gratitude.
This is a clear inference from the in
terpretation which the Nation as
serts is the only one that can be put
upon the faculty 'a action. "It
means ihat Harvaid has abolished
the game, and that other colleges
will bo obliged to follow suit." As
usual, the Notion is ahead of all
others in hastening the overthrow
of football, but hero at least it will
be balked, 'lhe game of football
may bo hurt but it has not yet re
ceived its death-blow, nor can any
single college, even Harvard, inflict
it.
