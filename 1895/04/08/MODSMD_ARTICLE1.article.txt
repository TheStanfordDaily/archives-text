# STANFORD WINS, AS USUAL.
## A 						Hot Day, a Hot Crowd, and Hotter Baseball. Hard Playing on the Part the Cardi nat Wins the Contest by the Score of 14 to 8. 
### 
The loss of eight out of nine games
is the unenviable record which stares
the Berkeley baseball fans in the face,
and judging from the manipulati jus of
our men while on their little jaunt
across the bay Saturday, something
even more serious than that will go ou
the archives before the reason closes.
From start to finish every man on
the team played good baseba I, and if
they keep up their pace of base run
ning, hatting, and clean team work,
their last defeat, has been already ac
credited them for this season. The
crowd was an impartial one, the day
hot, and the playing last. McDotiald,
a national league umpire, officiated in
that capacity and gave the best of satis
faction to both teams.

For the Berkeley team, Blasingame
«nd Johnson played the best game.
The former made several bits wlieu
they were most needed, and Johnson's
clean fie'ding in the left garden kept
the Stanford sun spots out of the twen
ties. Harvey was handled roughly
from the start, and was displaced by
Bond in the latter part of the game.
The latter fated no better, his curves
were mutilated and warped by every
Stanford man who faced him, but the
ball went invariably at the fielders

Dyer put up a star game at
secoud, accepting twelve out of four
teen chances. IJis two errors were
giveu on wild throws which a little
uio v coolness would have averted. The
best work of the game was his handling
of swift drives over second base. White
also put up a good game at short. The
battery work of JMcLaine and llussell
was fairly good. McLaiue was not in
his best form and was hit freely, llus
sell threw well to bases but was not
sure in receiving the ball from McLaiue
at critical times.
The remainder of the team played
with lots of ginger, but hit the ball
hard enough to win any game. With
plenty of practice there is no reason
why three straight this year should not
be accompli hod.
