The success of the Pinafore pro
duction was far beyond what one
would have predicted at the outset.
That so complicated au undertaking
can be carried out with a success so
complete in every detail gives evi
dence of unusual resources in our
student body, which labors under
greater disadvantages in the way of
mechani"al materials than are found
as a rule elsewhere. While the Univer
sity may feel proud of so artistic a
performance on the part of singers
and orchestra,it was the stagingof the
opera that called for especial praise.
The majority of colleges have some
place lor lectures and theatricals,
where even though the necessary
scenery is not possessed it can easily
be adjusted without interfering with
the gymnasium classes fora week of
stage and scenery building, electric
lighting, and chair transportation.
Here, if we wish to have our farces
etc. properly staged, all this trouble
is necessary, and the work is done
only to be torn down again until
some other affair a few weekg ahead
shall require a repetition of the labor.
It. is doubtless not probable that we
shall have a building on the c impus
for such a purpose very soon; the
gymnasium being a " temporary
wooden structure" seemed once to
have such a future, but circumstances
have created a great many temporary
permanences here. Still the suggest
ion of this paper might be repeated
that some fund be secured by per
formance or otherwise to provide a
portable stage, scenery, etc. for
erection when needed in the gym
nasium, until we are better accomo
dated. Under the present system
each stage setting is practically built
for one usage only, and the labor
and expense are very great. After tl e
way Pinafore was mounted the
managers of the college farces
look rather dubiously toward the
success of their own affairs, for the
means of obtaining equal equipment
are not the same.
