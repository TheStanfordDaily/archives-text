# CROWNED WITH SUCCESS.
## Production of "Pinafore" by University Talent. Large and Enthusiastic Houses Greet Both Representations of the Opera. 
### 
On Friday, April 5, and Saturday,
April 6, the long-suffering and phleg
matic Encina gym.—the place of mem
orial exercises, concerts, hops, farces,
vaudevilles, and what not —was trans
formed into a full-fledged opera-house.
The stage and scenery might have been
looked upon with envious eyes by tbe
pretentious manager of a traveling stock
company, arid the houses that greeted
the opera would have filled his soul
with bliss. Fair co-eds were there;
professors and their wives; professors
who have no wives; strangers and
friends were there; and the gallery gods
—the one indispensable feature of a
theatrical performance—were on hand
in lame numbers, and did their part to
their own huge satisfaction and enjoy
ment, and to the amusement of the
audience.
It was long after eiijhfc before the
curtain went up, but at last the Orches
tra filed in, tlie director took his seat
amid prolonged "ahs," and the curtain
went up on tbe ".Merry, merry maidens
and the tars." It, was a very pretty
and striking scene and drew forth a
storm of applause.
The long training of the choruses
was apparent from the first. This was
especially true of the malo choruses,
though at the first performance there
was some lack of confidence among its
members. This fault, however, wad
not, no'iceable Saturday evening
Miss Willis, as Josephine, had a dif
ficult task to perform, inasmuch as
she took the part at a late date. Not
withstanding this, sl.e gave a very
creditable rendition of her solos, and
did exceptionally well in her duos and
trios. In the second performance she
overcame the feeling of dilhdence that
was apparent at, first, and sang in a
thoroughly charming manner.
Miss Main, as Hebe, was captivating.
llcr acting was graceful and her sing
ing very satisfactory indeed
Miss Cowen's voice is well adapted to
the part of Little Buttercup, and her
acting was made a prominent feature.
The duet with Capt. Corcoran in the
second act was very sweetly sung.
Kennedy was well suited to the part
of Capt. Corcoran. Perhaps he has
never been heard to better advantage
here than in his solo, ''Fair Moon,'' in
ii
the second act. lie acted well.
Stratton, as the Admiral, has been
congratulated on all hands for the ex
cellent manner in which he portrayed
the stiff and dignified Sir Joseph. His
solos were all well rendered.
Baker might have been given a part
better suited to his character as a
humorist. His singing, however, can

not be criticized. Ou the high notes
his voice was clear and ringing, and
a charming pathos was put into the
love ballads.
Abbott as boatswain, and Cochran
as Toin Rowling, were both excellent.
Abbott made a hit in his solo at th«
beginning of the second act on Satur
day night. Cochran did especially
well in the trio of the Boatswain, Ralph
Kuckstraw, and Torn Rowling, his
deep bass showing up to splendid art
vantage.
As well as those mentioned were
suited to their parts, Simmons, how
ever, carricd oft'the honors in that re
spect. Ilis Dick Dcadeye was worthy
of a professional of long experience.
Ilis part was neither underdone nor
overdone, and he was at his best in his
solos.
' Finally, the Orchestra had no small
share in making the opera a success.
Theirwork has greatly improved since the
vaudeville. The solos were in compe
tent hands, and the playing on the
whole was smooth and finished
Taken as a whole, only words of
praise can be given the opera. II any
criticism were made it would be of the
kind applicable to all amateur theatri
cal performances; ''Pinafore," however,
was less subject to such criticism than
amateur theatricals usually are. The
performance both nights was a finished
one, though on Saturday evening it
was much smoother than on the night
before. Financially the opera was as
pronounced a success as in other re
spects.
The entire performaee was under the
management of H. (J. Connick, '97.
