The distinct success scored by
Pinafore was a credit to the Univer
sity, as it would have been to many
a professional company. Not only
was the singing and acting of high
quality, but those hitches and pauses,
those misconceptions of stage "busi
ness," so common among amateurs,
were conspicuous by their absence.
True, the moon on the first evening
set at defiance theCopemican system,
but this was the only exception.
Above all the work of the chorus, by
far the hardest thing to bring to per
fection in any opera, was smooth,
and, at times, brilliant. All of
which is a tribute to the musical and
histrionic talent of the University
and to the ability of the musical
director.
