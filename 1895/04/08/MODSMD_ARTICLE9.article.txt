At each new failure of the three
preceding graduating classes to pro
vide a commencement week suf
ficiently attractive to stem the tide
of home departure, the student body
has looked upon Ninety-five as the
class to establish the needed prece
dent. So far as has been announced
no have been taken to fulfill

this University hope, The necessary
committees should be appointed be
fore very long if the enterprise is to
be carried through in proper style.
This will l)e Niuety-five's last chance
to indulge her favorite pastime of
precedent making, aud let us hope
it is a case of saving the best wine
until the last. It will not be an easy
thing to mauage. The greater por
tion of the students seems to care
only to get away for the vacation,
and when the summer's fun is com
mencing a Senior Hop is not the at
traction it would be in the middle
of the term. So many events of this
nature are crowded into the second
semester that novelty is a diflicult
element to impart to the celebra
tion of commencement week; but
Ninety-live is a class of resources;
she means a good deal to the Uni
versity; and if she offers a week of
entertaiument, the rest of the student
body might at least remain and eat
of her funeral meats.
