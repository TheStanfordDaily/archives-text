# Rabbi Voorsanger's Sermon.
## 
### 
The Sunday sermon was preached by
llabbi Voorsanger of San Francisco.
His subject was"The Basic Principles
of Common Faith," aud his text,
"What doth the Lord require of thee,
but to do justly, aud to love mercy, and
to walk humbly with thy God?"—
Mieah vi., 8.
The law of kindness knows no nation,
knows no religion. If we were to at
tempt to formulate the history of man's
endeavors to overcome human nature,
we would find that all nations had that
same inherent tendency. It would be
a beautiful thing if the law of kindness
prevailed, if harmony bet ween the dif
ferent sects could be established, and
il the pre-requisite of religious life for
Protestant and Catholic, Buddhist aud
Jew, could be to do justly, love mercy,
and walk humbly with his God. The
prophet Mieah was one of the few ideal
ists who was ten thousand years in
advance of his time. We are slaves of
environment; we arc slaves of early
education; slaves to our churches and
to thousands of pre-couceived ideas
which go with us like barnacles fas
tened to our souls until deposited with
us in our graves.
Though the world is old it will be
much older, and there must be a time
when the old ideals can be realized,
mid when there shall be one God for
all men. Today the dreamer may
dream on just as of old, but the day
must come when nation shall not war
against nation, and religion against re
ligion. That has been preached often,
and yet today the world is the same as
betore, aud we think the old cynic of
Eisclesiastes was right when ho said,
'•That which has been is that which
sha'l be, aud there is nothing new
under the sun " None tire so danger
ous as those who hug their own con
victions to their breasts; for none are
so intolerant. The history of religion
shows how bitterly churches can perse
cute one another, i'eople not only dif
fer in religion, but persecute each
other with the hope of making their be
liefs predominate. The history of the
ology is the enforcement,! not of
truth, but of its interpretation. I'eople
are not divided by principle, but by in
terpretation. We could find that all
people have the same ideas on certain
subjects. There are many by-paths
but they all lead to the same end. The
history of religion shows that people set
up their opinions as the only scheme of
salvation. When state and church
stand for the same expression of con
trol, then opinion over-reaches itself
and enforces slavery of the intellect.
Theology, as a department of human
metaphysics, has arrogated unto itself
such powers that who knows but in the
eternal years of God it will have to do
expiation? It, has conditioned truth by
formula; it has net up standards and
compelled men to bow before them.
Whereas everything has progressed,
teligion is behind in the race. Men
ure united in almost everything, but

thoy are divided in religion. The con
version of the Jew is prayed for on
Good Friday. Jews do not object to
being prayed for, but conversion is only
bringing one man to another's point of
view. This is the scheme of an ambit
ious church aud not of the eternal God.
Can you not show kindness, no matter
what your conception of God is? Can
you not be good whether entering by
one door of the church or another? Can
it not be possible to have the old groves
back with the stars of God as lamps,
and for worshippers, men who have for
gotten interpretations and wish to wor
ship their common God?
1 am a dreamer, and a Jewish dreamer
—there is it disadvantage in both; but the
dreamers are increasing. Jesus was
dreaming when he said the kingdom of
God would come like a thief iu the
night. What is the condition now? —
high Guelph, high Ghebeline. i'eople
swear by different names that stand lor
the same truths. There can be but one
truth and but one God. We have out
grown old things, lint the world can
not think of everything. The world is
hungry and athirst, and our continuous
elbowing prevents us from looking to
the higher ideals of life. It is only in
theology that men say, "1 alone have
the truth." It is all wrong. There is
not the faintest allusion to interpreta
tions of God in the Scriptures, aud why
do we need it? Do we need a definition
for electricity or for the law of gravita
tion? Aud why should we for that
which is the law of all laws aud the
cause of all causes? There should be
one house of worship to which all
nations would go, but we think others'
opinions are insufficient and the creeds
now stand at war, testifying that the
kingdom of God has not couie. I, who
am a Jew, claim that it is possible to
bring religion to such a point that all
people can worship together and live at
peace together. There is yet an ideal
hi the world that can be brought to
realization. Hut we must make the
aim of our lives not the creed but the
deed; not the sectarian interpretation,
but the priuciple.
From all the creeds the basis of a
universal faith could be taken, if inter
pretations are disregarded. Did Jesus
begiu with interpretations when he
gave the seruiou ou the mount? You
aud I believe in God. All men in
whom the moral sense is grafted be
lieve in God. Every interpretation caj
be welded into the word God, and why
must we say one or three or twenty?
Why not call him father? We can
have a religion that shall be the utter
ance of Buddhist, Jew, Mohammedan,
and Christian; for the essentials iu
which all men believe are the same.
We all believe in a God. But we will
never know his nature. We know him
i only by effects. We know him in the
world around us, in the constellations,
| and in the laws of evolution. We
know him in the conflicts between evil
and good in men; and knowing him,
why can we not unite in worship

and place ourselves in harmony with
him?
All people believe that there is but
one God. Trinity does not exclude
unity. There may be three forces.
There is but one God — Jehovah.
Allah is Allah, although Mohammed is
his prophet. I'eople believe, too, in
some kind of divine communication
with man. It is called by many names.
The great law of compensation is also
common to all beliefs. No nation or
creed ever called good evil, or evil
good. I dare not tell you that God
will reward or punish, but I can say
good rewards itself and evil punishes
itself — "Bread cast upon the
waters, will return after many days."
All men believe in the continuance
of life. Life is not circumscribed with
this globe or with this body, but is
eternal—in conditions that the human
intellect cannot understand. The spirit
goes to God who gave it. All agree
that the mission aud destiny of man is
to become better and purer. Some day
the second advent of Christ will come
—and the Jew believes in a similar
time when the Messiah shall be king of
all the world, not of a chosen people.
God will bring his people together be
neath the banner of peace. l)o you
need a better religion? If in future
years it is necessary to staud up for one
religion, know that all are like children
who stand in equality before God.
Love all men and all righteousness, no
matter wheuce it couies, and you have
endeavored to bring about the kingdom
of God. You may not accomplish it. "Not
unto thee is given to complete any work,
neither can )ou withdraw from it. Do
your duty."
If God permits us to grow as we have
done, differences shall be forgotten and
people shall worship the Father, bless
ing truth for what it is. In those days
we shall not hear the words Jew and
Christian. The cross and crescent will
be welded into one symbol of the omni
potence of God and the unity of man.
The passions of man shall havq» grown
cold, and the love of man more divine.
If you only go a little way, do it for the
sake of God, and men will take one
another by the hand and in the glory
of angels will see the new prophet
standing before the world surrounded by
his people. And once more we shall
say u Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah,
Lord of hosts." All the earth is filled
with his glory. Amen.

his prophet. I'eople believe, too, in
some kind of divine communication
with man. It is called by many names.
The great law of compensation is also
common to all beliefs. No nation or
creed ever called good evil, or evil
good. I dare not tell you that God
will reward or punish, but I can say
good rewards itself and evil punishes
itself — "Bread cast upon the
waters, will return after many days."
All men believe in the continuance
of life. Life is not circumscribed with
this globe or with this body, but is
eternal—in conditions that the human
intellect cannot understand. The spirit
goes to God who gave it. All agree
that the mission aud destiny of man is
to become better and purer. Some day
the second advent of Christ will come
—and the Jew believes in a similar
time when the Messiah shall be king of
all the world, not of a chosen people.
God will bring his people together be
neath the banner of peace. l)o you
need a better religion? If in future
years it is necessary to staud up for one
religion, know that all are like children
who stand in equality before God.
Love all men and all righteousness, no
matter wheuce it couies, and you have
endeavored to bring about the kingdom
of God. You may not accomplish it. "Not
unto thee is given to complete any work,
neither can )ou withdraw from it. Do
your duty."
If God permits us to grow as we have
done, differences shall be forgotten and
people shall worship the Father, bless
ing truth for what it is. In those days
we shall not hear the words Jew and
Christian. The cross and crescent will
be welded into one symbol of the omni
potence of God and the unity of man.
The passions of man shall havq» grown
cold, and the love of man more divine.
If you only go a little way, do it for the
sake of God, and men will take one
another by the hand and in the glory
of angels will see the new prophet
standing before the world surrounded by
his people. And once more we shall
say u Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah,
Lord of hosts." All the earth is filled
with his glory. Amen.
