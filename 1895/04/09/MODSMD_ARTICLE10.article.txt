A question which is receivinc
much careiul thought and general
attention among Eastern co'leges is
iho honor pystem, in which the stud
ent pledges himself neither to give
nor receive help during an examina
tion. There are two wajs by which
a student can be placed upon his
honor: he can be forced to sign the
pledge, or there can be a silent
understanding between the professor
and his class that the instructor will
forbear the stiict espionage sjstem,
making them feel individually thut
lie places colfi lence in their honor.
'Ihe methods which hold that the
students should be watched and sus
pected during an examination, as
little children who cannot distin
guish between tight and wrong,
tends to encouiage a cunning decep
tion on the student, derogatory to
the class and to the professor who
subjects the class to such a system.
V student should hold his word of
honor inviolable. If a man does
not hold liis word of honor in the
proper light, that deticieucy in his
moral make-up may cost him dear in
time to come. Wo not infrequently
hear of a popular leader being cast
down by his most ardent supporters
because a falsehood has been proven
against him.
Whatever system is used, be it tho
espionage or the honor, all tempta
tion to fraud should be removed,
and if the student is put upon his
honor his word must not bo doubted.
I here is no question as to tho bene

lit derived in improving the tone of
a-college by making the students self
governing.
