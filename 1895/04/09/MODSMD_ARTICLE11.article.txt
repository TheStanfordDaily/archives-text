The importance of the Carnot
Medal debate must not be forgotten.
This, notwithstanding the unique
rules governing it, is an intercollegi
ate contest, and must not. be lost
through the indifference of the stu
dent body. To be sure, the medal
will be awarded to a single man, but
the joy and glory and prestige of
victory will go to the university
furnUhing the fortunate debater. In
future years the Carnot Medal will
doubtless be one of tho most inter
esting and popular of the iutercol
legiate contests, but at present there
seems to be but little interest in it
here at Stanford. Next year it will
be held at Berkeley, and we can rest
assured that our opponents will not
be indifferent to their opportunity.
The advantage of the first contest is
with us, and it must not be thrown
away. A scattering audience and a
chilly atmosphere instead of enthusi
asm will put our men at really a
greater disadvantage than the Berk
eley representatives, who at best will
be addressing strangers and rivals,
while our speakers have the right to
expect loyal support.
It is to he regretted that cards
have been sent out fur social events
which will interfere very seriously
with the of the audience. So
cial pleasures should he put aside
for that one night and the chapel
tilled to oveiflowiug.
