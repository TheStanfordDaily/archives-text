There seems to be a special de
sire 011 the part of man} interested
students to have "Pinafore" pie
seuted iu San l' ranci>co some time
in the near lutuie, but for just what
reason, unless it be a financial one,
is a mystery. Would such au un
dertaking be either wise or politic?
Would the public look upon such
an enterprise favorably?
Grave reasons might be given
against such a move. In the first
place the students participating must
have their work broken into at a
very ciitical period of the semester.
Then, too, mauy parents who have
not the slightest objection to allow
ing their daughters to appear before
their own classmates might well be
expecte<Lto object to a debut before
outsiders.
Another seiijus consideration is
the danger that some one of the San
Francisco dailies might choose to
treat the presentation in a tensa
tional manner. Such au account
copied a few times would soon meta
morphose the prim skirts " ten
inches from the floor" into "whirling
saucers of gauze."
Every Stanford (student who saw
the opera presented may well feel
proud of the ability shown by those
taking part and of the artistic suc
cess of the entertainment, but there
is no reason to suppose that nucli an
amateur performance would meet au
equally favorable criticism before a
disinterested public.
