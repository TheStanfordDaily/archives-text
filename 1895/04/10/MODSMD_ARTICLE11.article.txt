Tiik Charity Bull iH a clever inven
tion of some Ward McAllister in
fashionable life, a device fur combin
ing the delights of dancing, flirting,
aud wearing one's most rakish toi
let, all forswr-et t haiity's sake. It is
doubtful if mauy of the gay pleasure
seekers see a flitting vision of little
orphans or the sick and miserable,
wi.o are the real heroe* of iiin ball.
While there is some incongruity in
this conscience-quieter, the Charity
Ball, there is really a great deal of
pure philanthropy and kindly leel
iug under it all.
It was a good institution to intro
duce here for its incentive toward
beneficence, and because it adds
another to our few social pleasures;
and after all, chanty begins at
home.
