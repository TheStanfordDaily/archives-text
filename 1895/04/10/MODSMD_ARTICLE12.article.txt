We owe it t<» outselvHs »nd to our
friends of Berkeley >o give our oj>-
pouents in next Saturday's debate
t lie most courteous treatment.
Whenever our representatives liave
mossed the bay, they have met only
kindness. At last Satuiday's gume
there was no ' joshing" from the
bleachers, aud while Stanford's g. od
plays were not applauded to any ex
teut, they were not met with hisses
or with ridicule. The Berkeley stu
dents exerted themselves in every
way to make the visit of our athletes
pleasant.
It behooves us to return the court
esy. If the debaters themselves
and the friends who accompany them
itre received in a spirit of good fel
lowship, if the speakers are heard
with appreciation and respectful at
tention, it will do much to confirm
and strengthen the friendly spirit,
which should exist between the two
universities
