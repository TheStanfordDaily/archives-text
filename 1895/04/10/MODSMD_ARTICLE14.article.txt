Tin re are two more days of prep
aration and anxiety till our men of
brawn uud o:n men of brain en
counter the representatives of U C.
It is to be hoped that our athletes
make a good showing, but it is al
most imperative that our debaters
should come out victorious. College
athletics hold an important place in
University life, but the production
of brain, not of muscle, should be
the chief concern <>112 a college. The
great athletic university of America
is not the one which has exerted the
widest influence; her oft-defeated
livul has exerted, and will long con
tinue to exert, by far the wider iu
lluence on American eulture and
American thought. Ttoe inflated
interest in college athletics is a craze
which will in time dieout. Educators
will continue to first place to
the cultivation of the mind, and
where then will be the athletic col
lege?
It cannot be too often repeated
that we are, in these first few jears,
forming the general character of
Stanford. We, the students, more
than iiny taeuliy committees ot
boards of regents, are to determine
what institutions, what characteris
tics, are to mark this University in
the years to come. If we choose to
have it grow into a college almost,
wholly athletic, at the expense of
literary, scientific, philosophical in
terests, it is m our power to do so.
The whole matter rests with us. If
we can win athletic victories while
maintaining our intellectual suprem
acy, well and good; but let us see
that we put the ''things of the spirit
above the things of the llesh."
The track athletic team gees to
the city baturday with the hearty
good wishes of the whole University,
but our most vital interests are cen
tered in the evening's contest on the
platform.
