Chauncey M. Depew delivered the
address to the auuual convocation of
Chicago University ou April 2d. In
the course of his remarks he said:
The best use to which wealth can be
applied is to assist these great univer
sities which are educating the youtti of
our land.
This institution, which owes its ex
istence to the beneficence of Rockefel
ler, is in itself a monument of the
proper use of wealth. So is Cornell, so
is Vanderbilt, and so are the older col
leges, as they have received benefac
tions of generous, appreciative, and pa
triotic wealth. But in view of the
dangers which arc about us and of the
difficulties which arj before us, we can
not rely upon what the rich may do, or
what philanthropy or generosity or wis
dom may suggest. The state has al
ready done well in the common schools;
it has done better in the high school,
and better still in the final opportunity
which it gives in many cases fora lib
eral education.
It would be a long step forward in
popularizing higher education if the
government should establish at Wash
ington a great national university. As
tit Oxford or Cambridge there are his
toric colleges with foundations running
back for hundreds of years, and each
having its own traditions, but all part
of the university; so in every state there
would be colleges, each having its own
merits and traditions, and all of them
belong to the grand university which
will represent the culture of the new
world, the University of the United
States.
