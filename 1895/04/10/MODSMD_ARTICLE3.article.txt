In aii article in the Easter number o!
I TaperB Weekly entitled "A Yale
View of the Football Situation," Mr.
Gamp says in substance:
'•In the first place, our system is
wholly different from that at Harvard.
Our laculty could at, any moment,
should it seem right, forbid any sport,
and there would be no appeal. The
only men outside the faculty possessing
actual power are the captains and
managers.
The faculty has in its own body
certain men like Prof. K. L. Hichards
who have always followed and made a
study of the sports of the students, and
it is upon the opinion of such of its
members that the faculty relies for
information regarding the quality and
general direction of the athletic sports
of the university.
"Nor are these gentlemen and other
members of the faculty even averse to
giving their advice to the actual
members of the association?; and it i*by
keeping thoroughly posted tha* they
have been able to give such excellent

advice in the past. Many of the
reforms and the steady growth in proper
channels of Yale athletics have been
due to the conscientiousness of these
members of the Yale faculty, and es
pecially to their intimate acquaint
ance with the athleticsports themselves.
Under these conditions a state of affairs
such as that ref< rred to by President
Eliot, of drugging athletes, and that
mentioned hy Dean Briggs, of "mon
strous methods of training" bringing
about "low academic standing," could
hardly exist and could not possibly
continue.
"At New Haven there is no drugging
of the men. Summer practice was
practically dispensed with last year, the
gates were thrown open during the
week of sectet practice, and moderation
was the rule. Athletes are required to
keep up to the standard in their studies
the same as the other members of the
university.
' One might grant, il it be affirmed by
the Harvard faculty and President
Eliot, that football last year at Harvard
was unsatisfactory, llow could it be
otherwise if the stories the president
hears are true, that the players are
drugged for nights before their games
to iuduce sleep? But one is not pre
pared to grant, as suggested, that other
colleges, and among them Yale, 'shirk
the responsibility' because they do not
conduct their athletic matter as Har
vard does or proposes to do.
• 1 A number of years ago the future
of intercollegiate sports was regaided by
Harvard as in jeopardy,aud a set ol res
olutions was prepared. Among these
regulations the most prominent was one
limiting any intercollegiate boat race to
three miles. Yale and the other col
leges did not concur, and, failing to se
eure five colleges, Harvard eventually
abandoned its regulations. Boating has
not materially suffered on this account.
Still more recently Harvard passed a
regulation confining athletic contests to
New England. I'll is also proved a fail
ure. These two examples seem to be a
practical confession that Harvard is not
infallible upon the athletic questions
even in her own borders.
"Every college may have its own
system, but it seems hardly lair to con
demn intercollegiate sports if one system
fails. Besides, as has been shown, the
makers of any system may change their
minds about the expediency of their
plans.
"There is exaggeration of many kinds,
but it does not seem that the entire sys
tem of intercollegiate athletics has be
come so exaggerated that it must be
abolished."
