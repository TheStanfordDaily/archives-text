# The
						So-Called "Missing Link."

### 
The February number of the Amer
ican Journal of Science contains an
article which should be of interest i«»
our students of Evolution. Professor
Marsh discusses the discovery of the
Pithecanthropus Erect u*, a i'omi inter
mediate between man and the higher
apes. The article contains severel
drawings of portions of the skeleton
iind a thorough description of its pecu
liarities.
The fossils weie discovered in 181)1-
02 in lava rock in the island of Java by
Dr. Dubois. The discoverer claim*
that the animal is the true "missing
link." While the skull has only two
thirds the capacity of that of a man.
other bones bear a remarkable resem
blance to parts of the human frame.
The thigh hone, in particular, is almost
indistinguishable from the human
femur, and shows that the animal
walked upright.
After refuting some of Dr. Dubois'
arguments, Prof. Marsh concludes sis
follows:
"It is only justice to Dr. Dubois and
his admirable memoir to say that he
has proved to science the existence of a
new anthropoid form, not human
indeed, hut in size, brain power, and
erect posture much nearer man than
any animal hitherto discovered, living
or extin'it. This brief review of the
main facts relating to the discovery
will afford the reader some idea of the
importance of this latest addition to the
known allies of primeval man, if not
to his direct, ancestry. Whatever light
future researches may throw upon the
affinities of this new form that left
its remains in the volcanic deposits
during the Tertiary time, there can be
no doubt that the discovery itself is an
event equal in interest to that of the
Neauderthal skull. . . . The ape
man of Java comes to light at a time
when zeal for exploration is so great
that the discovery of additional remains
may be expected at no distant day.
That still other intermediate forms will
eventually he found no one familiar
with the subject can doubt."
