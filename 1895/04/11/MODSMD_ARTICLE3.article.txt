# The
						Harvard Football Situation.

### 
Considerable interest has been mani
fested in the action of the Harvard
faculty in regard to football, and the
Examiner this morning gives the latest
phase of the situation. It is as follow.":
Boston, April 10. â€”Football at Har
vard has been saved. At 11 o'clock
this morning over twenty men, consti
tuting the overseers, met to discuss the
question. No one was in favor of giv
ing the its quietus, but there
were many who were strongly opposed
to its rough features, and they were
ready with statistics to show the harm
done. All, however, were agreed lhat
the boys were in need of a warning, but
not a man was in fuvor of doing away
with the game.
After a h>ng discussion it was voted
that in tile judgment of the board of
overseers the decision of the question
of the continuance or abolition of inter
collegiate football at the university is
within the powers of the athletic com
mittee, under the standing rules of the
president and fellows and the board of
overseers. As the athletic committee
is in favor of the continuance of foot
ball at Harvard this places full power
iu the hands of its members, and, of
course, there is no doubt as to what the
action of this committee will be.
The boys will be cautioned to confine
the games to college grounds and do
away as much as possible with pub
licity. Another season of hard knocks
would probably kill the game at liar
vaid. A lining the students there is
general j y and much enthusiastic ex
pression over the situation.
