The Evolutoin class received a de
lightful surprise this week, in find
ing that each member is to prepare a
thesis on one of twelve imposing
subjects. Perhaps this is consola
tion for those who dropped Evolu
tion last semester on account of
"over-work."' We have been silent
all the year, suppressing our
natural desire to air our theories of
cosmic order and as to whether or
not " acquired characteristics are in
herited"; now we shall have ample
scope i in which to express our views,
and no doubt the piofessors will re
ceive many valuable additions fo
science.
