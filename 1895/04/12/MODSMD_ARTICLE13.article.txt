It grows very weausome to con
tinually strain one's ears in class to
catch the faint tones of a die-away
translation. We are often tired, but
it does not tend to arouse enthusias
tic attention when a modest damsel
swallows her words, or buries them
in a yard of veiling. It is not only
inconvenient to miss a whole trans
lation, but it overcomes ono with
ennui and arouses nothing but ir
ritiition toward the reader. The day
of weak, KO-called effeminacy is past,
and the flat, weak voices should be
laid on the shelf along with the
sampler and knitting-needles of our
grandmothers.
