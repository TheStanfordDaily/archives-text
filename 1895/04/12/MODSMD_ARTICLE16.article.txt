Tiie meeting of the Board of Di
rectors of the Co-operative Associa
tion this afternoon brought to light
some startling facts, which, if true,
show too plainly the development of
u full-fledged "spoils system" in our
Student body politics. Respecting
the wishes of those interested, no re
port of the Board's action appears in
the Daily Palo Alto; suffice it to
say that vigorous steps were taken
to suppress the evils now existing,
which will tend toward more health
ful manipulations in the future.
This prompt action on the part of
the Board is both commendatory and
timely- The remunerative offices
controlled by the Student Body were
all, in a great part, created for tho
spcciul purpose of rewarding deserv
iug and needy students. To use
such an office to further tho incum
bent's political interests is a mal
feasance which should by no means
bo overlooked. As the number of
graduates from the University in
creases, the time will soon come
when the non-resident members of
the Co-operative Association will far
more than counterbalance those
pursuing courses of study at the
University. To control these votes
as has been attempted, would virtu
ally make the managing office a
hereditary one. Four years has pretty
firmly established tho precedent of
a single term, no person having held
office fora longer period in the his
tory of the institution. This initial
step, taken to thwart tho evident will
of the majority of tho students in
tho association, has received its
deathblow, and it is to be hoped that
the occasion will never arise upon
which we will be again compelled to
chroniclo such action.
