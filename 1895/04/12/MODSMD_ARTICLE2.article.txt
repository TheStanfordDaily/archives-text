•'Mazamas" is the name of a society
i.t' mountains climbers. It was organ
ized on tlie summit of Mount Hood,
Oregon, on t lie 19th day of July, 180 t,
at, which time aud place the constitution
and by-laws were adopted and lirst, of
ficers elected. Its organization was
unique and successful. The experience
of its members on that occasion inspires
i hem to further achievements.
This year their aspiration is to convey
i.y means of heliographs along the line
ui snow-cupped peaks a sunbeam mes
sage from Hritish Columbia to Mexico.
Washington, Oregon, and California
are invited to co operate and carry out
this plan.
The principal mountains in Oregon
and Washington u"»'.!abc for the pur
pose, beginning at the north, r.re:
Maker, Mainier, St. Helens, Adams,
Hood, Jitlerson, Three Sisters, Dia
mond l'enk, Thielscn, Scott, and I'itt;

and in California, Mounts Shasta, Tel
lac, liound Top, Dana, Lycll, Stillman,
Whitney, Lowe, Daldy, and such other
peaks as arc necessary to complete the
chuin.
Citizens residing in the vicinity of
the various mountains available for the
purpose above suggested are besought
to "take a hand" and aid the attempt.
Arrangements can be made so that
parties on sub-peaks, or iu the valleys
and towns along the lines, can communi
cate those on the main mountains,
and each group of mountaineers can,
from'tfceir several signal stations, "tele
graph" by Hashes to their neighbors
below the fact of their presence on the
peaks, and also that the "message''
from British Columbia is on its way,
and of the transmission of the answer
from Mexico.
The intention is to send a message
from British Columbia to Mexico and
transmit an answer from Mexico to
British Columbia; and as each message
passes a signal peak, such signal peak
is to report the fact to all sub-stations
aud groups in the valleys and towns in
their vicinity as are prepared to re
ceive it. Storms may obscure some
main peaks, so numerous side stations
or sub-peaks are desirable to secure
transmission of the through message.
The instrument to be used is the
modern heliograph, such as is in use in
the army, using the "Morse
code." Heliograph instruments can be
obtained or prepared at comparatively
small expense. The secretary of "Ma
zamas" will, on application, furnish ad
dresses of regular manufacturers, and
information for making suitable instru
ments sufficient for the purpose.
The date fixed for this event is the
10th day of July, 1895. The main
body of Mazumas as a society will as
semble at Mouut Adams in the state of
Washington. Correspondence is do
sired with all outing clubs, athletic,
mountain, military, university, aud
scientific organizations on the Coast.
Each party is requested to arrange
for procuring photographic views of
their several "camps" and principal
points of interest, particularly of the
group of climbers on the peaks attained.
Correspondence id solicited and in
formation will be supplied by the so
ciety. Address all communications to
T. Brook White, Secy.
