# An Anarchistic Minister.
## 
### 
Prof. George Herron of lowa College
is to lecture before the Congregational
Club of San Francisco next Monday.
Mr. Ilerron is a wonderfully modern
and original man, a pastor who is ac
cused of anarchy by many people. He
occupies the chair of "Applied Chris
tianity" at lowa College, and has ex
pounded numerous daring theories,
llis followers believe him to be inspired,
while his detractors consider liiui an
enemy of the government. His ideas
of political economy arc radical, and
have stirred up much hostility among
the clergy. Prof. Herron is a man of
breadth and sincerity, and will be an
acquisition to our corps of lecturers if
we can secure him for one day next
week.
