# WON BY STANFORD.
## The 						First Carnot Medal Debate a Success from Every Standpoint. Good Speeches from All, but Sandwick Carries off the Honors and the Medal. 
### 
One ol' the largest audiences that ever
pi the. red in the University chapel as
sembled there last Friday evening to
hear the first debate between the Uni
versity of California and Stanford for
the Carnot Medal. Long before tlie
tune set for the debate every seat was
taken, and a person was fortunate to get
«*ven standing room. Before tlie de
bate began every foot available for this
purpose was occupied, and many per
ilous were turned away.
President Kellogg of the University
of California, who was to have presided
at the debite, was unable to do so in
conseouence of illness, and Dr. Jordan
officiated instead. In his preliminary
remarks Dr. .Jordan stated that when
liarou de Ooubertin visited this coast,
last year lie became greatly interested
in the two California universities. De
siring to establish a system of debating
here similar to that used in one of the
eastern universities, and at the
same time to awaken an interest in
French politics, and to honor a great
Frenchman, he offend the Caruot
Medal to be competed for each year by
Stanford and Berkeley.
The question debated w;is, "Was
Casimir-Perier justified in resigning
the presidency of France?" Sandwick,
Stanford, was the lirst speaker for the
affirmative. He commenced his argu
ments by stating that Casimir-I'erier
must be judged by human standards;
that if he did what other men would
have done under similar circumstances
lie was justified . He depicted clearly
and logically the irresistible forces
which were brought to bear upon Cas
imir-Perier, and showed that the pres
ident. of France must retain the favor
of the Chamber of Deputies, which
Casimir-I'erier had lost. Sand wick's
manner of speaking was easy and
natural, and his arguments were forcible
and convincing. He created a very
favorable impression.
Friend, of Berkeley, followed for the
negative. His voice was not pitched
in a very agreeable key, and the first
impression that he created was not to
his advantage. He overcame this, how
ever, by the force of his arguments,
lie maintained that Casimir-Perier
went into office aware of the difficulties
that must be encountered; that a strong
man was needed, one who could success
fully oppose the socialists, and that
Casimir-Perier hail believed himself
to he such a man ; that he deliberately
and cowardly hlt his post when his
services were most needed. Friend's
delivery was much against him.

Judging by the hearty reception
which the Berkeley contingent accorded
Lyser, the second speaker en the affir
mative, it was evident that they ex
pected great things from him. This
expectation was lully realized. He
spoke in a calm, deliberate, and logical
manner, and successfully answered all
of the arguments advanced by the pre
vious speaker, lie presented other ar
guments that went unanswered during
the entire evening. Lyser was by far
Berkeley's best representative.
Sheldon (Stanford) came next with
a forcible speech lor the negative, lie
cleared up the ground in au amazing
manner, and then made some brilliant
points, every one of which hit the mark.
Sheldon undoubtedly carried off the
honors of the evening for the most log
ical speech. Every argument was clear
cut, and every point was grasped by
the audience. Sheldon's fault lies in
his delivery, and in his choice of lan
guage.
Clark of Berkeley spoke next for the
affirmative, though often he gave strong
arguments for the negative. He took
particular pains to show that if M. Kris
son, who, he insisted, was Casimir-Per
ier's worst enemy, would not form a
ministry, it was impossible to form one.
lie euded his argument as follows:
"Love of country was superseded by
ambition and another man has gone
out." Claik took occasion to remark
by way of parenthesis that "The Refer
endum is the greatest evil that can be
fall this or any other country, and es
pecially California." This little sally
caused considerable amusement. It is
needless to say that this decision of the
question for debate next Saturday
should induce the Stanford meu to
cease their labors and resign in Berke
ley's favor.
Harrington of Stanford closed the
negative, lie spoke in a slow and dig
nilied manner, and the arrangement of
his argument was logical, lie lacked
energy, however. The attention of the
audience was liable to be distracted.
With a little more life, Harrington
might have won the medal.
In the second speeches Sandwick
showed up the best, though Lyser gavo
him a close rub. Sheldon made a wise
stroke of policy by bowing to the pre
siding judge and sitting down. Clark
created a better impression than he did
at first.
After the judges retired the concen
sus of opinion among the audience
seemed to be that the medal would go
to Sheldon, Lyser, or Sandwick. The
judges, Rev. J. N. Heard, 1). D , pres
ident of the University of the Pacific,
Pelhani W. Ames, Esq., and John A.
Wright, of San Francisco, were out for
a long time. They finally filed in and
Dr. Jordan announced that the medal
had been awarded to Sandwick. This
announcement was the signal for an
outburst from Stanford, and cheer after
cheer was given.
The debate was entirely individual,
and in one respect, it might be said to

be almost unique. Members of dif
ferent universities were ou the same
side of the question, and although it
was an individual debate, there was
some team-work. Such a course is
very unusual iu the history of inter
collegiate debates. The best of feeling
prevailed throughout the entire even
ing.
