# 66 TO 46.
## Berkeley Wins the Field Day. Frazier Breaks a Record. 
### 
The annual Intercollegiate Field-day
was, as anticipated, a defeat for Stan
ford, but it had the moral effect of a
victory. The most enthusiastic partisans
of the cardinal hardly dared hope for
more than lorty points, and the score of
66 to 40 was an agreeable surprise.
The unexpected happened in several
events. Some races which were looked
on as moral victories for the cardinal
went to U. C., while others which the
Berkeleyans fully expected were taken
by Stanford.
l'he day was very unfavorable fjr
records. A cold drizzling rain had
fallen all the morning, and a chilly
wind swept the track. There was a
small crowd enthusiastically devoted to
Berkeley. Stanford applause was at a
discount until Harry Reynolds did the
unexpected by winning the 220 hurdle,
when the cardinal supporters applauded
iu regular football form.
There wassome delay at the start, but
at 2:30 the first heat of the 100-yard dash
was started with Bernhardand Seroggins
entered, the other entries for that heat
having been dropped. As both were
therefore sure of a place in the
they trotted over the course in 15j-£
seconds. The second heat brought out,
Barnes, Knowles, and Carter, who fin
ished in the order named. Iu the final
Barnes, who was the surprise of the
day, beat Seroggins by a narrow mar
gin, Berhnard, who seemed in poor con
dition, coming in third. Time 10 4-5.
Between heats of the 100-yard dash,
Culver, Hoffman, and Dyer contested
in the 120-yard hurdle. They got off
well together, and raced almost together
half the distance, when the Berkeley
men drew away from Culver, who be
came discouraged and let lloflman come
in an easy winner in 17 1-5 seconds.
Culver should have kept on, as a hurdle
race is never won until the last stick is
cleared.
In the mile run Capt. Brown held
back until near the end of the last lap
encouraging Copeland and Fry. Con
sequently, while Copeland came in an
easy winner, Brown found himself un
able to overtake his speedy brother,
who finished a rather poor second. All
the runners lagged until the last lap,
and the time was only 4:5.'l 1-5,
Farmer took the lead in the mile
walk, closely followed by Mervin, with
Timm third and Holton last. In this
order they continued until the last lap.
Some fifty yards from the tape Mervin
spurted. In trying to keep his lead

Farmer "broke" and was disqualified.
Holton took sccond place by a neck from
Tiuira, who had walked throughout in
fine clean form. Time 7:50 4-5.
The 410-yard dash was taken by
Koch in the good time, considering the
track, of 52 2-5. Knowles, the only
Stanford entry who came to the start,
was a close second, and Bradley third.
The pole-vault was taken by Dole,
who was in splendid form, at 9:11 1-4
Culver came second at 9:8, and Mumm#
third.
During the track events a half a
dozen big fellows had been throwing
the hammer. Kdgren, as was expected,
won the event by a clean throw of
121:1, Ilazzard lame second with 88
to his credit, and Watson third with
BG:G;£.
The 220 hurdle was the agreeable
surprise of the meet. Ouly Reynold*,
i Hoffman, and Bakewcll faced the
starter. They got ofi" well together,
j but Reynolds began to draw away at
the third hurdle and was never headed,
lie broke the tape while Ilofi'man was
clearing the last hurdle, and equalled
! the record of 27 3-5 seconds.
U. C. withdrew all entries in the
| bicycle race, and accordingly Roper ami
; Gregory paced Culver to break the
record: 'I bis he did by a margin ol
j over fifty seconds, reducing it from
i 6:18 to Roper was credited
I with second place, and Gregory third.
The 220 dash was a sacrifice for
j Stanford. Bernhard had the misfor
j tune to be cutcred in the preliminary
heat against both Scroggiusand Barnes.
The I). C. men took first and second
place, and the second heat was con
tested solely by Berkeleyans. Barnes,
the sturdy IJ. C. freshman, took the
final, with Scroggins and Magee secoini
and third. Time 23 45.
Stanford had another chance to jell
in the 880-yard run, which was the
most exciting contest of the day. Colt
took the lead at the start and was well
in front on the last lap. Coming on
the home stretch, Copeland drew up
j and romped in an easy winner. Mean
while Brown, in a magnificent spurt,
| passed Colt atid got second place. Time
I 2:4 3-5.
It was a poor day lor the running
high jump. Patterson, as was expected .
won easily with 5 feet 8 5-8 inches
to his credit, with Koch second and
Toombs third. Reynolds was withdrawn
from this event.
The broad jump was also a U. C.
victory, being won by Woolsey with
the rather poor distance of 21:4 3-4.
iM. Dozier was second and Johnson
third.
Koch put the 16-lb. shot 37 feet, 2
3-4 inches and won the event, with Or
cutt second and Edgren third.
The results throughout were, as has
been said before, very encouraging,
and a splendid endorsement of the
i good work of Mr. Hunter. There is
no reason why, with a moderate good
! fortune in the incoming freshmen, we
' should not win the games next year
