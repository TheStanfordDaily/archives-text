It seems to be the general opinion
that a Senior farce would follow tou
closely upon Junior Day to be en
tirely successful. The semester has
been full of theatrical events and
something more novel than nu oid
piiiry college farce should bo thought
ot to give the class day the interest
it needs. Any suggestion will be
welcomed by the c'ass. There are
nil sorts of things that could be
done, revivals of classic or early
Kuglish plays, open air theatricals,
a nautical farce on the lake, etc.
There is not much time to be spent
ou deciding what to do, and an ef
fort should be made at once to hit
upon some suitable idea for develop
ment.
