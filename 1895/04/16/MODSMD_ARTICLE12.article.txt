With Saturday's Held day mult
no Stanford mau let-la down-cast,
l>ut on the other hand the majority
of the students are highly elated.
In order to make relatively as good
ii showing as we did last year thirty
two points were necessary, i'et we
took forty-five and should hive had
seven more, 011 the walk and
the mile-run. This iu face of
the fact that Berkeley hits the
l>est team she ever had; a team in
which she so implicitly confides
that she is willing to spend time and
mouey to match them against the
Eastern athletes. Any one who
witnessed the events must have con
cluded that another year of such im
provement in our athletes will mean
Berkeley's Waterloo. What possible
encouragement our friends over the
bay can wring out of last Saturday
is a mystery. Beaten at baseball,
beaten at football, beaten at debate,
and so near a defeat in what she has
always regarded as her invincible
stronghold, it would seem that alarm
and disgust would settle over the
blue and gold.
It is a well understood fact that our
good showing was tho result of the
completion of a track and the bene
fit of a traiuer. The men though few
in number trainod conscientiously
and the track captain was tireless in
his efibrts to bring about success.
That so small an audience was pres
ent was disheartening; for had the
day been a good one, au immense
crowd would have been 011 hand
and there would have been a chanco
to break some re cords.

In today's issue appear certain
amend meats to tlie constitution of
the Student Body which should re
ceive the hearty support of every
student interested in the welfare of
athletics. The idea is briefly to se
cure it treasurer of mature and sound
business judgment, to have till
moneys handled by him, to relieve
managers of the necessity of hand
ling any cash whatever, and to hold
the treasurer responsible in au ef
fectual way and, at the same time,
give him some remuneration. It
centralizes power in three men ef
fectually cheeked by the Executive
and Athletic Committees. The
office of treasurer is by far the high
est tribute in the line of good, sound
business judgment and honesty that
can be conferred on any one of our
number, and, at the same time, it re
quires more lime aud energy and re
ceives less thanks and credit.
The faults of the present system
are many, vet it is a necessary step
in the evolution of a more satisfac
tory method. Duriug the past year
finances have been conducted on a
plane inestimably higher than here
tofore and the results have been im
mensely more satisfactory. The
present officers have, in fact, fol
lowed the plan suggested in the
amendment as far as it did not con
flict with the constitution, and the
amendment is offered to secure the
continuance of the present business
methods and at the same time to le
move certaiu features of the present
constitution which have made the
fullfilment of the plan impossible.
During the first semester nearly
850,000 was handled by the treas
urer, and it was evident to every one
that some security should be given,
but at the same time it was impossible
to ajk fora houdon an empty honor.
The largest defects in the present
constitution are the cumbersome re
quirements of consent from the Ex
ecutive Committee for expenditures
From experience tbis has been found
impossiole and at tho same time not
as secure as to centralize responsibil
ity and to place matters in the hands
of three men best in position to
judge.
The evils of the past have been
largely duo to the 100-e methods of
handling accounts by managers and
the impossibility of the treasurer to
determine the exact condition of fi
nances until the season ends and the
manager presents his accounts,
and it is impossible to check any
injudicious expenditures until it is
too late. Under tho amendment
the treasurer would pay all bills
and thus have the accounts
constantly on hand, and at the same
time relieve the manager of enough
work to do away with expensive
assistant managers.
The amendments are the result of
discussions between the Faculty
Athletic Committee and the present
officers and ure based on actual ex
perience and good judgment.
