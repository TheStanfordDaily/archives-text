In tiie New Unity for April 4 Jcnkin
1 Lloyd Jones tells something übout bis
trip through California. This is what
Mr. Joues says about Stanford:
'•The Leland 8 tun lord University,
; with its capacious campus, ton miles by
! four, its gracious cloisters designed by
Itichardson, the master American arch
itect, is a most prophctic institution,
I not on account of these facts or its mu
j uificent endowment, but on account of
j its large-minded president, I>r. Jordan,
and his associates. lie, also, through
his love of nature, is slowly finding out,
with his associates, how to solve prob
lems of human nature.
"President Jordan, Prof. Hudson,
whose recent introduction to the "Phil
osophy of Herbert Spencer" is a book
j that awaits the Neio Unity's grateful
comment, Professors Koss, Anderson,
and others, are doing more perhaps
than the workers in any university in
the country in the way of applying
i evolution to ethics and religion. Under
! their instruction the world is becoming
! to the young men and women who flock
i there an inspiration, a perpetual joy."
