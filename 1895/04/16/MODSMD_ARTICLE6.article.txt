# The 						Easter Sermon
## 
### 
The chapel Sunday was made more
attractive than usual by the Easter
decorations, l'rol. Thoburn conducted
the services. The subject-matter of his
talk wasas follows:
I am sometimes overcome by the fact
that our attainments are so small com
pared to our opportunities. I long to
see the day when our University shall
be as broad as its alumni, But growth
is also accompanicd by degeneration,
Nothing grows except another thing
gives its life at the same time. The
body of a tree is surrounded by a sphere
of green twigs, but there are dead twigs
inside its hollow trunk that are crowded
into darkness by the pushing life on the
outside. Tliis only produces a larger
growth.
But there is another phase which
produces one-sidedness. We are rich
in assets. May I stand them over
against our liabilities? Our assets con.
sist in our freedom from restraint and
from precedent, the location of our col
lege site. Our liabilities are all summed
up in the words, "For unto whom much
is given, much shall be required."
Here we choose our own ways. We
are removed from that humanity which
we study. We find that forms and rit
ual have lost their meaning for us. We
uo longer have any use fur creeds. Our
religious life is more thoughtful, not so
emotional.
Nothing pleases us so much as union.
We see farther and ought to overlook
differences. ]jut we shall not be stu
dents only. We must go into the
world. Fortunate if we can carry out
with us the understanding of relations.
Then our wisdom will be charity, and
our religion, toleration. We will not
pick people to pieces su much, but look
upon their failures as we would upon
the incomplete efforts of a child. We
will make our charity include the nar
row minded.
As our trunks are packed for home,
we begin to ask, " How can we recon
cile people with these new thoughts ? "
Always keep this background: our duty
to be true to the only standard—that
in our own hearts. More is required
of man than of the lower animals; this
is the penalty imposed upon him with
his powers. The functions we neglect
are lost to us. It is a curious thing too
that we can lose powers without know
ing it. We may live in the midst of
charity and not be charitable. In the
midst of this world a man may live a
parasite and none but his God know
it.
Nature does not allow anyone to live
long who does not serve the future.
The man who studies for love of study
is going contrary to the laws of Nature,
lie has no excuse for his acquirement
until it reaches the heart of the race.
We ought to have a super-major—
humanity's, and use our study for its
help. Our life is incomplete otherwise.
A more perfect life will be ours when
we have learned that it i« better to
give (ban to receive.
