# The 						New Witchcraft.
## 
### 
A large audience was iu the chapel
room last night to hear ])r. Angel
speak on "The New Witchcraft." The
room was tilled to the doors. Dr. An
gel has made the study of the phenom
ena ot' the mind las attention, and gave
evidence of it in his popular lecture
last night.
In substance he said : 1 will state
two principles. Every memory image
differs from the original only in that it is
less iuteuse. A thing may be present
in mind and not in consciousness.
Home people dream by sound, others
sight. One of the most distinguished
(scientists gave himself to the study of
this lie studied all the thoughts that
were associated with images. He was
surprised at the multitude of the images
hi his mind.
All the images of childhood flow
along just below notice; ordinarily no
attention is paid to them. A thing
may be present in mind which is not
present in consciousness. A clock is
only not iced when it stops. Among
these images are motor images; raising
an arm gives a motor image. These
take tip much of our attention.
Mut the question is asked, Why don't
those memory images rise up? They
do. By eating too little, taking alco
holic drinks, etc., they rise. They do
not rise in normal life because we have
our attention on other things more im
portant, Sometimes these mental
thoughts do lead us and possess the
attention.
This is the basis of the conjurer's
profession. The successful conjurer
works by illusions, Si the minds of
bis subjects are led.
I'lanchets weroexplained thus: Think
ing of the rigtit hand the machine obeys
ilie mind; so with the left, and so with
the body. We think of the moving
and we go iu that direction uncon
sciously. It is not a mesmeric phenom
enon. The mind reader finds things be
cause he is pushed in that direction.
You push in the way you think.
Some people think iu visual terms.
Mozart thought in auditory terms.
Many people think in motor terms.
There are classes who think by push
ing. Such are motor terms. This is
the explanation of table turning. The
people can move tables by motor terms,
because they can not put their hands
on the table without pushing it. The
person may not think it, but it is scien
tifically explained.
Anything which leaves the mind free
opens it to illusions. Hypnotism is
just such a state. A monotonous state
puts the will out of function. It is well
known psychologically. Trilby is pos
sible. She was a possible person. Hyp
notism is peculiar, in that the persons
have superhuman power. Cases have
been known where print, can be read
reflected from a visiting card, and where
the muscular power is increased. The
reducing power of the will is not under
control.
No person need be hypnotized unless

he wish. It is given to the unwilling
because it is catching. It is nut mys
terious psychologically.
Telepathy is the sympathetic affection
of one's mind by the thoughts, feelings,
or cuiotious of another at a distance,
without communicating through the
ordinary channels of sensation. This
phenomenon wants scientific evidence
to establish it. It is paid that in
America there has developed a myth
which has become an established
mythology.
