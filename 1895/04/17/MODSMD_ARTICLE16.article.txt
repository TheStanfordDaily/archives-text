The fact that the busebull team
took the first game t. 112 the intercol
legiate series is no reason why we
should be confident of winning next
Saturday. A good team frequently
goes down before inferior opponents;
the slightest error sometimes causes
an entire team to go to pieces. The
boys played good ball in the first
game of the series, but. tliev should
guard against any over-coofidence.
liesides, U. (J. has engaged a new
and efficient coach, and there is no
telling what improvement they may
have made iu these two weeks.
Faithful practice is as necessary now
as it has been at any time this
season.
