The proposition to give "Pinafore"
<luring Commencement week lias a
great deal to recommend it. The
Hildebrand Library fund lacks con
siderable of reaching the amount re

quired, and as the opera is to be
given for the benefit of the library
fund it is reasonably certain that
the amount needed will be made up.
The opera will ulso be an importaut
attraction during the week, and will
undoubtedly influence a large num
ber of students to remain until after
Commencement who otherwise would
not care to do so. The large num
ber of visitors who are here during
Commencement week will get a good
idea of our talent in the operatic
line, and ' Pinafore" will do much
to make their stay pleasaut.
