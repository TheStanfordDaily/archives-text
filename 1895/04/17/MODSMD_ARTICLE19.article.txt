On Satuiday evening our repre
sentatives will engage in a contest
that certainly concerns us as much
as any athletic struggle whatsoever.
Good debaiirg talent may not indi
cate the stauding of a university, but
it comes much nearer being a test of
the matter than good athletic material.
It is not until our professional men,
our literary men, our engineers,
have gone out and proven themselves,
that we can say how well or ill we
have built, in the meautime, de
bating is one test of comparative
merit. Excellence iu athletics is
good. It indicates energy, force, an
interest, iu practical things, a healthy
state of afi'tirs for any college, but,
after all, the University that wins a
debaie proves itself belter than the
one which wins a game.
We sent down a thousand wild
euthusiasts to cheer on our victori
ous athletes last Thanksgiving. We
need a little of that football spirit in
the matter of the debate. It is a di
rect duty to alma mater and to our
representatives to send a strong dele
gaiion. The sympathy of his audi
ence means more to a debater than
to an athlete. Few speakers can do
well in the face of an audience
which is cool or hostile. Every
Stanford man and woman slionld
make a special effort to be pieseut
at this most important contest
