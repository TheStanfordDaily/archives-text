manceof Ben Jonson's "Silent Woman."
The Hasty Pudding Club of Harvard
is about to present a new classical farce
"Proserpina." The plot of this unique
play turns on the question as to whether
it is a crime to steal a kiss, and whether
it is not disposing of stolen goods to re
turn the same. Four performances
will be given in New York, three in
Boston, and three at Cambridge. The
action takes place in Arcadia and in
