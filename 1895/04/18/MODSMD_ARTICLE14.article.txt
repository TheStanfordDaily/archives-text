Inasmuch as the baseball team has
done little or no practice for the
game with Berkeley next Saturday,
and as there is a disposition on the
part of some to consider the game
as good as won, it may be well to
emphasize the editorial in yesterd ty's
issue warning the team against over
contidence. A little more hard work
and less assurance of victory would
be more in harmony with the situ
ation.
