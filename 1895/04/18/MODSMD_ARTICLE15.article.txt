The high gr'ss around tlie tenuis
courts has become 11 source of com
plaint from many players. Through
negligence in this respect 11 large
number of balls are being lost daily,
and the courts present a very un
attractive appearance. There seems
to he a misunderstanding in regard
to the responsibility for the condi
tion of the courts, but inasmuch us
the Tennis Club was given the ex
elusive use of two courts on con
dition that the club keep all of the
courts in order, it ought to bo clear
upon whom the responsibility res's.
However this may be, the courts
should be put in order before the
tournament with Berkeley next Sat
urday.
