In the issue of the Berkrlryan con
taining an account of the intercol
legiate field-day an article signed
'•A. VV. N." (presumably the editor
in-chief of the paper) made state
ments so false that they require some
notice in these columns. Among
other things the author stated that
Dozier, the U. C. man who \vus en
tered for the bicycle race, did not
participate in the race owing to a
scheme on the part of the Stanford
men to "lay him out." The writer
makes this wild statement without
the slightest possible foundation for
it, except possibly his own fanciful
imagination. Such baseless and
pernicious statements as the one
quoted do more to keep up that ill

feeling which Stanford Ims done bo
much to suppress, and Berkeley has
done ho much to foster, than any
other one thiu«*. The attitude of the
litrlid'ijiin in allowing such ground
less statements to appear in its col
umns is unworthy of the institution
it represents. In so doing the
edilor stoops to the little, despicable,
high-school journalism that should
find no place in a university.
