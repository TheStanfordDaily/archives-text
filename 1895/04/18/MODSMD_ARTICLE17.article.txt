When the facts which led up to
the suspension of several members
of our Cycle (Tub from L. A. W.
contests are known, the injustice of
tljo action will become apparent to
all. It was generally recognized
that there was no bicycle contest at
the intercollegiate field-day, asßerke
ley forfeited the race, and two of our
men paced a third fjr an exhibition
race. Under such circumstauces it
was not deemed necessary to obtain
a permit from the L. A. YV. author
ities. The fact that one of the lead
ing newspapers in Sau Francisco did
not mention the rnce in any connec
tion ought to be sufficient to show
how the race was regarded by the
general public. The petition of the
Cycle Club is eminently just, and
the suspensions should be removed.
