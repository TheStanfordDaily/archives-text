Kditor Daily Pai.o At.to:
The committee on Junior Pay pro
gram lias decided upon the following
order of eveuts : farce in the morning,
field day in the afternoon, and hop in
the evening. With due regard for the
judgment, of the committee in charge,
there are many reasons why the farce
should not come in the morning.
The farce is a source of revenue, and
should be held in the afternoon, when
the largest audience can attend. The
expenses incurred in producing the
play will reach a large figure, including
the salary of a professional coach and
the cost of special scenery. The com
mittee and cast have made unusual
preparations to insure the success of
ihe production. Therefore the income
from the sale of seats should be a prime
consideration. II the farce is given in
the morning, visitors from the city (and
a great many are expected) cannot ar
rive in time.
The athletic part of the day's exer
cises is, on the contrary, not a source ol
tevenue, and should not be allowed to
umrp the afternoon at the probable ex
pense of the financial success of the
farce. Furthermore, the field-day, as a
Junior Pay event, is an innovation and
should be secondary to an established
feature.
If the field-day is in the afternoon
spectators will be obliged to stand
around for several hours and thoroughly

fatigue themselves tor the hop. If the
farce is in the afteruoou the two hours
rest in the theatre-gym. will he a de
lightful rest after the morning's sports.
The athletics will not be materially im
paired by coming in the morning; nor
will the farce in the afternoon necessar
ily interfere witll the decorations and
other preparations for the evening pro
gram. ,J. It.
