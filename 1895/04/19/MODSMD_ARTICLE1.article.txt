# REDEMPTION OF LAW.
## Today's Discourse by the Rev. Geo. D. Herron. 
### 
A large crowd assembled at the
chapel this afternoon to listen to an
able address by the Rev. (Jeo. I), ller
ron, Professor of Applied Christianity
at lowa College. II is words are given
in summary:
I shall not regard this subject from
the standpoint, of the economist nor the
social scientist., but, from the Christian
theory of law. Social reformers are
coming to agree more and more that
reform can only effect itself through
the state. If so, it must effect itself
through the changes of law. This
brings the conception of .Jesus as law
giver. I>i*tinciion between moral and
state law is a mistake, it there is a
principal of right anywhere, it. will be
universal. Christian law i.s the evolu
tion and I ill til Intent of the old Hebrew
law. The education of every Hebrew
child c insisted «»l the primary law of
the laud. The function of law was
education. Men were t-ducatad in
righteousness. The psalmist loved
God's will. I'pon the common study
of law the integrity of nations depends.
Hebrew law emphasized the value of
life.
Tho Christian doctrine of law finds
expression in Paul. According to hit
doctrine society is the end for which
law exists. Not individual protection
but mutual association and justice is
ihe end of law. The study of Christ's
law only can bring us out of this athe
ism. In popular thought, courts of law
are no longer courts of justice. They
do not educatc the people in justice.
Law and justice have become separate
entities, which may or may not be
united. No legal sophistry can conceal
the fact that justice lies in the hands
of the wit. To say an act is legal no
longer signifies that it is right In
Pennsylvania there is no way to punish
the railroad magnate who stole six mil
lion dollars from the state's treasury;
but the man who steals a pair of shoes
is found behind the prison bars. This
is the anarchy from which this country
neflds redemption. Note the legalized
plunder of railway corporations.
Through financial crimes the courts
have control of half the railroad lands
of this country. The managers of
these corporations compel high rates
of traffic and low wages, and get high
incomes from society for the individual
purse. Without redress, the Americans
urc paying interest on a capital stock
amounting to billions of dollars that
never had an existence.
The railway system is the greatest
menace to the political integrity and
perpetuity of this nation. There is al
most absolute irresponsibility on the
part of jthese properties to the nation.
We ought not to be obliged to main
tain what private corporations control.
We should reorganize the laws for the
fake of humanity. Tho present state
of affairs affords education in lawless

ness and corruption in politics. In dif
ferent parts ot' the country we have
contradicting decisions in the courts.
We have a diverted interpretation of
the law which may he more dangerous
t j the liberty of the people than des
poi in in.
I am not seeking to underestimate the
sense of property, it has been the ob
jjct of social worship. Hut the rule of
property has usurped the rule of the
people. Institutions of law have be
come the instruments of lawlessness.
In America in the past decade, the loss
of human life was considered as nothing
in comparison to the loss of property.
Railroads have caused the death of
thousands for personal gain, and we
have no way of punishment. In Chicago
the death-rate has averaged five a day.
Is it worse for the highwayman to kill
fora jooketbook?
In 1894 who decided how these
sixty-five millions of people should be
taxed '/ The sugar trusts. is that
rule by the people and for the people '(
The one supreme di.sa.-ter that can come
•"o us is to have people lose faith in leg
islation and justice. Lincoln declared
that it was dangerous to place capital
on even an equal basis with labor.
This is the utmost that we have ever
contended for. Capital being the fruit
of labor, he would place labor above it.
Much el' liberty has been lost siucc
Abraham Lincoln. Property despotisms
have been built up. Law has become
the instrument of the perversion of
liberty instead of its protection. We
have been training the people in
polical infidelity. We have become the
most lawless and socially destructive of
peoples, through individual interpreta
tions ot the law. While all nations are
in dread of discontent, our nation is
tending to disorganization. This is the
result of our love for the material. We
exalt property above hutniu life. We
have the theory that law exists for the
protection of property alone. Unjust
laws are responsible for the conflict of
labor and capital. Protection of
property is not the end of government,
but is incidental to the development of
manhood and society.
We need society, home, and justice.
Social justice is the defense of life.
The Anglo Saxon conception of law is
the accumulation and protection of
rights in contrast to the Christian
doctrine of justice in society. We shall
one day learn that competition is not
law but anarchy. Out of the insistence
upon individual rights instead of social
obligation, has grown the inordinate
regard for property. The larger the
amount of property, the more rights men
demand. Out of this question of rights
is evolving the greatest problem of our
country. Not the individual man but
the race should be the social unit. It
is time we should study man's subjective
moral nature, no longer study him ob
jectively as an animal. The Hebrew,
Anglo Saxon, and Roman conceptions of
law must bo united in the Christian
conception if ibis nation is to be saved.

The fundamental law of this universe,
of man's creation, is sacrifice, service.
Civilization can only advance as men
understand these. Justice is not the
protection of men from one another,
but adjustment of one to another.
When we get rid of our sentimental
conception of love and learn that love is
law, then law to protcct society must
become love.* Our courts of justice will
become courts of love. The state will
then be an institution of society, an
institutional manifestation of Christ
Law must at last be judged by its power
to adjust.
The redemption of this nation will
come through the saving of this nation
front legalized anarchy by the introduc
ion of Christian law. Pessimism be
lieves in leaving the existing state of
affairs alone. Optimism teaches us that
a better order of things is at hand. We
must look to Christ for reform. The
question for us is. At whose hands shall
the better order come'/
