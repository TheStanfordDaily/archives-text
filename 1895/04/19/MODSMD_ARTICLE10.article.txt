Tut mo\einent of the Co-Op. man
ngement iu selling all English books
at cost will meet with the hearty en
dorsement of tlie student body. It
has been the custom heretofore to
leave unsold books on the shelves
from year to year, no attempt being
made to dispose of them. This year,
however, it has been thought best lo
give the students the benefit of the
nbility of the Co-Op. to ptuchase
books at cost. Consequently those
who are making up private libraries
will have an unusual opportunity of
purchasing good books, and every
student who can afford to do so
should eagerly take advantage of the
oppoituuity.
