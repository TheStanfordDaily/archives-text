Tomorrow Stanford and Berkeley
meet in three iutercollegiate con
tests. Two of these take place on
our campus, and one in San Fran
cisco. A large representation is ex
pected to come from Berkeley to
witness the tennis and baseball that
will be played here in the morning

mid afternoon, and a few words
should be said to remind Stanford of
our courteous treatment at the hands
of Berkeley when the last contest
took place on the California campus.
The same kind and courteous treat
ment thty fco generously accorded us
should in a like measure be returned
at the contests tomorrow. The dis
agreeable hissing and jeering of un
fortunate mistakes should be con
spicuous by their absence. On the
other hand, let the applause be gen
erous whenever Berkeley makes a
good point, lhit in our desire to
show our apprecition of Berkeley's
points, let us not be slow in recog
nition of our own. Especially is our
presence and enthusiasm needed in
the tennis tournament. In the past
Stanford has always been remiss in
giving our tennis men the proper
encouragement. Tomorrow should
be a conspicuous exception to the
rule.
The debate in the evening is the
most important intellectual contest
of the year, and from pre.-eut pros
pects it promises to be the most
royally waged contest in which
the two universities have yet been
engaged. The importance of a large
representation from Stanford has
been fully emphasized, but we wish
again to urge every student to attend
the debate. Encouragement in the
way of applau e is more necessary to
the debater than to the athlete.
