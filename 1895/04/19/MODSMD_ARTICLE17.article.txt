Palo Alto, April 18, 1895. J
Kditor Daily Palo Alto :
At the last meeting of the Board of i
Directors of tho Co-operative Associa-j
tion no startling facts were brought to
light, as stated in an article published
in the Daily Palo Alto of April 12.
1 did not see the article until this
evening, hence the delay in sending in
a communication. At the meeting of'
the Hoard of Directors of the Co-oper
ative Association on the 12th insfc. a
complaint was lodged by Mr. Ilinsdill
that the manager of the Association
had transgressed his authority in send
ing out the following letter to non
resident shareholders :
'•Dear Friend: Enclosed please find
a proxy for your vote to be used in the
coining election of directors for next
\ear. You will confer a favor on the
Association by signiug and forwarding
tho eauie to J. S. Snyder, J. M. Stow
o 11, F. L. Entler, Flora Hartley, or
I'rof. U. H. Gilbert, or to any member
<»f the Association who has an active
interest, in its welfare.
Very respectfully,
J. M. StowelL, Manager."
This letter was accompanied by a
Malik proxy and an unaddressed stamped
envelope calling for its return to J. M
Stowell if not delivered in five days.
The claim was advanced that in seud
ing out this letter Mr.Stowell had trans
gressed his authority. In order that
those to whom this letter had been
addressed might not be under the im
pression that Mr. Stowell was acting in
an official capacity in sending out this
letter, Mr. Stowell was requested by
resolution of the Board of Directors to
send out a uotice to this effect. A
motion to have this notice printed iu
the Daily Palo Alto was opposed by
me at the time because there 6eemed no
call to give more publicity to the second
letter than had beeu given to the first.
The character of your editorial, how
ever, is such that in justice to Mr.
Stowell this statement should bo made.
Chas. 1>. Marx.
[ The above facts are essentially the
same as those which provoked the
editorial referred to. The mere fact
that the manager's letter stated "you
will confer a favor ou the Association,"
and also that the persons mentioned
were favorable to his candidacy for
his re-election, was considered sufficient
ground for the condemnatory article.
