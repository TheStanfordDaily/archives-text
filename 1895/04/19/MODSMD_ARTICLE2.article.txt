# Tomorrow's Contest.
## 
### 
The team which will play against
Berkeley on the new diamond tomorrow
afternoon at 2 o'clock will be essentially
the same as the winners of the first
game. The only change will be in the
right garden. Calhoun has banded in
his suit on account of pressure of Uni
versity work and will be replaced by
Jeff. The team has had very little
practice sin&e the last contest, while the
Rerkeley uine has been working con
stantly. From all accounts they are
fielding cleanly, and also doing heavy
work with the stick.
Capt. Dyer announced the following
positions: McLaine p, llu&sell c,
Young lb, Dyer 2b, White ss, Lewis
3b, llarrelson If, Sheehan cf, Jeff rf.
Substitutes, Pincus and Thompson.
