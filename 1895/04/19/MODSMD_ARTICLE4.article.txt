# English Books at the Co-Op.
## 
### 
Commencing with next week the Co-
Op. will sell all English books at exact,
cost. The stock comprises a large as
sortment of standard works used in the
various departments of the University.
This move was decided upon in order
to reduce stock, and to give the students
an opportunity to obtain a good library
at a low cost. The reduction is for the
benefit of all students, and not simply
for members of the association.
