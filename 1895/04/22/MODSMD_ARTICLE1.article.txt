### 
An enthusiastic audience of about
1200 people gathered in ibe Metropoli
tan Temple in ban Francisco last Sat
niday night to lij-tcn to tlie third an
nual Intercollegiate Debate between
Stanford and U. C. The debaters ap
peared on the rostrum about 8:15, and
tlie chairman, Prof. Heugstler of the
University of California, after a few in
troductory reuiaiks, read ilie question:
'Tlesolved, Tbat, in California any legis
lative enactment,, uot deemed urgent,
shall be submitted t'> a vole ot the citi
.....
Kens, upon petition of live per cent, of
the qualified voters, provided such pe
tition be made within sixty day*; ai d
furthermore, that nuy measure proposed
by a petition of ten per cent., ol the
v(itevs shall be submi'ted to the people
•by the legislature."
The affirmative tide wis supported
by our representatives, Messrs. IJ. F.
Bledsoe, '06, 15. ]\L l'almer, 97, and
K. De Los Magee, '9oj and the nega
tive by Messrs, James W. Clark,
Martin C Flaherty, and George F.
Noble The judges were Charles
Page of the California Har, Warren 01-
ney, Sr., and ex Justice M)rick.
Mr Hied soe led the affirmative. He
assumed as the foundation of the affirm
ative's argument the principle that gov
ernments obtain their powers from the
consent of the people, lie then argued
that the proposed measure would not in
volve a radical change in our govern
mental system, but would only be the
final development of a principle which
has been steadily growing ev<r since the
adoption of the federal constitution
In support of this position, he cited the
direct popular control of the New Eng
land towns which has exist*d from the
beginning, and showed that., notwith
standing the faith in the principle of
representation held by the early states
men of the Union, every state except
one (which is not California) today gives
an opportunity for popular ballot upon
proposed legal measures; that in Cali
fornia the right ot popular voice has
long been recognized in the location of
the capital and county scats, and that
a petition signed by twelve per cent, of
the people of a county duly presented to
the board of supervisors can compel a
popular vote upon the issue set forth.
The Republic of Switzerland was also
cited as an example of successful direct
legislation. In concluding this part of
his argument Mr. lilcdsoc said that
" the belief that the people should have
the right to control has been coincident
with our history," and that "the pro
posed system has clearly been promised
in our country and exemplified in other
countries."
He then disclosed the weakness and
inadequacy of our present representative
system, which makes the proposed sys
tem advisable. He represented that
iihout sixty per ccnt. of our legislators
were lawyers, u bile the per cents, re

spectively in our population of medic-,!
men, merchants, clerks, etc. were much
larger than that of lawyers. This is
very sigtiificieaL in view of present class
legislation. There is not only not uni
versal majority representation, hut there
is not even a majority party representa
tion, for the representative is hound hy
the party platform, although the real
political issues may have been practi
cally reversed long before the end of his
term of office. All this, es
pecially in view of the contempt which
our representatives have shown on var
ious occasions to wiitten and verbal
petitions, he characterized as misrepre
sentation, and as contrary to the basic
principle that the people should rule;
the general dissatisfaction resulting from
which having been shown in the change
from annual to biennial sessions of the
legislature, and other limitations that
have been imposed upon its jurisdiction
The negative was opened by Mr.
Clark, lie made the unqualified ad
mission that all the evils enumerated
exist, but took issue upon the remedy.
He claimed, moreover, that the refer
endum and initiative arc two different
things and cannot bo treated as synon
ymous, and that a failure to support
both these elements of the question
must give the decision to the negative.
The speaker defined representative
government, as one in which the people
posscsss the political sovereignty and
delegate the law-making power. This
was the obvious intention of the framers
of the Constitution, who knew from his
tory that it would be impossible to
govern a large area by direct legislation.
It has proved successful in small towus,
but never in the state, or even in large
cities; for the prevailing tendency in
municipal governments has been toward
strong centralized authority and rc
sponsibility in the person of a mayor.
Prof. A. B. Hart of Harvard was
quoted as having wi itten that the adop
tion of the referendum and initiative in
Switzerland hiul led to dangerous
apathy in governmental a flairs. Fur
thermore, the amendments proposed
under tne initiative in Switzerland have
savored very strongly of socialism,
i From these considerations the referen
dum and initiative could not be reckoned
a sucoer-s there; but conceding that they
were, owing to the great variety of con
flicting interests in California which do
not obtain in Switzerland, it does not
follow that the system would be success
ful here. There would be no means
for compromise, no common ground so
necessary iu the control of large in
terests.
Mr. Palmer followed with a rapid
though distinct clean-cut attack upon
the corruption of the present legislative
system, emphasizing in the strongest
terms that the will of the people is the
final court of appeal. He claimed that
; the same objections which his oppon
ents had presented were the first urged
against referendum and initiative in
Switcrland, but that now the Swiss
people are united in their approval. To

every session of'our legislature at least
one bill lias been passed under very
suspicious circumstances, and the cur
rent price of the California representa
tive is well known. All the evils oi
the pernicious bribe would be eradi
cated by the referendum, lor while one
or a dozon representatives can be, the
whole people cannot be bribed, and the
secoud veto power would reduce the
legislative bills to a legitimate uumbcr
and exclude all the dishonest ones.
The argument that the referendum and
initiative would minimize the duties of
the legislature was exploded centuries
ago; restricted legislation is obviously
what we The destructive influ
ence of monopoly, furthermore, owes its
existence to the present bribe facility,
and would ceasc under the referendum
and initiative.
In his summary Mr. Palmer repeated
his main arguments to prove that the
present evils of political machinery, of
corrupt legislation, and of monopoly,
would be sure to fall under direct leg
islation.
Mr. Flaherty, who next took the floor,
began by impugning our arguments for
their want of adduced instead of hearsay
or assumed evidence. He also maintained
the distinction between the referendum
and the initiative and urged the neces
sity of treating them separately. He
claimed that present wrongs are due not
to the political system but to the gen
oral disinterest of the people; that
under the proposed measure the same
disinterest would cause the same results
Great expense for conducting elections
would also follow, which would be used
as political capital by the out party.
Comparison was agaiu drawn with
Switzerland both as to the industrial
interests represented and as to the num
ber of laws passedj the enactment, ol
over a thousand laws in a year would
be impossible by direct legislation
Again, our government is the result ol
a steady growth which could not with
safety endure such a radical chaugo.
Moreover, it is necessarily conducted
by trained men, and the proposed
chauge would cousigu it to the care of
unskilled hands. As an example of
what dircct legislation would produce
he cited Kearny ism. He called
attention to the ambiguous use of the
words "people," "citizens," and
•'voters," and said that its confusion
would preclude debate in a legislative
assembly.
Mr. Magee of the affirmative insisted
that the affirmative were there to dis
cuss practical politics. The most ob
vious truth of world-wide government
is the tendency toward democracy, and
hence the pertiucncy of the proposed
measure. The government of Switzer
land was again brought up, and Mr.
Magee showed that the authority of
Prof. Hart, cited by the opposition,
| was incompetent in that it was taken
from a newspaper article written after a
short visit to Switzerland. Many of
' our laws are not supported by public
opinion, and hcnce aro dead letters,

which would not be so under direct
legislation. ]Jut legislation, again, is
feasible today because of our numerous
facilities for communication and trau.<
portation. In closing he said that the
people are competent to legislate; that
direct [legislation alone can serve the
interests of public opinion, and that it
is a right which the sovereign people
ought to excrcise.
Mr. McNoblc followed with a very
able address, lie argued from an al
most purely legal standpoint. After
reviewing the history of the develop
ment ol our syt-tem of law and juris
prudence, he also concluded that the
present governmental system is not at
fault, but rather the indifference of the
voters; and that there are plenty of lion
eft men for the positions if we will
elect them. The referendum is un-
American, and bus no advantage over
the present means of submitting con
stitutional amendments. lie dwelt at
length upon the necessity of skilled and
trained legislations.
The closing argument was made by
Mr. JJledsoe. lie maintained his firM
position: that the tendency has fora
long time been toward direct legislation,
that no danger would follow its adoption
now, and that it would be a remedy for
the present evils and equal to all prob
able future emergencies. In view ot
present political corruption be denied
that our government is now in the
hands of skilled legislators, or if skilled,
"skilled in what?" IJe claimed that
the large number of bills which have
been parsed by our legislature hereto
fore, and which the negative represented
could not be passed under the referen
dum and initiative, would by the latter
system be cut down to a reasonable and
just limit. As to the wording of the
question, quibbling over technicalities
was unneccessary; the affirmative, he
said, were advocating direct legislation,
which was very clearly indicated in the
question as stated.
After stating the unanimous saiis
laction of the judges with the masterly
and able discussion on both sides,
.Judge Myriek announced the decision
in favor of the negative.
