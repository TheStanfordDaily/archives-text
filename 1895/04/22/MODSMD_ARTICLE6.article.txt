Elaborate preparations are being
made for the Junior Farce, and the
event promises to be a notable one.
Special f-cenery has been painted,
the gym. will be wired much as for
•Pinafore," and rehearsals under
the direction of a professional coach
l.ave been in progress for several
weeks. To thosewhohavewatehedthe
evolution of our co'lege theatricals
ti e contrasts ure great. We look
back to a time when the farces in the
chapel were less otiginal than the
► ceuery, which consisted for the
most part of a couple of sheets hung
over a certain picture and having n
wild-looking window drawn upon
them in charcoal. The .Junior Farce
last year was written and produced
in little more than two weeks, but it
was iu the gym., which was
a great undertaking. The primitive
sheet hud giown into cheese-cloth
and wallpaper through which the
daylight shone brightly, for electric
lights were a di\am of the future.
The Senior Farce made a big depar
ture in scenery and lighting, and
now the old gym. iu the throes of
preparation for the farce doubtless
longs for the old days when farces
were thought successful without the
aid of fine scenery, electric lights,
and intelligent moons. But the rest
of us think differently, and the farce
on Friday is awaited with interest
by all.
