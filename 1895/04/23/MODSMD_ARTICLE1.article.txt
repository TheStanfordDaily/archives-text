### 
'Hie second game of the series with i
Berkeley was played on the Stanford |
campus Saturday and resulted in a:
second victory for the cardinal, this
time by the score of II to 4. Stanford
excelled at the bat and made only half
»s many errors as Berkeley, but our
errors were more costly and all but one
of them were productive of runs for
Berkeley. McLaine wa< invincible and j
the H. 0. would have been shut out il i
he had been a little better supported; j
not one of their runs was earned, j
Berkeley's err jrs also contributed ma
terially to the run-getting, but Stanford
batted Bond and Harvey hard enough
to win even against the best of support
Lewis led the batting with a three base
hit and four singles in live, times at bat.
The double umpire system was tried j
and did not prove a magnificent success.
W'eldou's decisions were satisfactory but
I'mpire Cohen, U. C's new coach, was
a little rufty on the rules, and Captain
Dyer was several times obliged to reg
ister a protest against his decisions.
Stanford took the lead in the first
inning. Berkeley was first at bat; a
base on balls to Johnson and Jeff's
muff of Blasingauie's fly gave them two
men on bases, but Proctor and Harvey
went out, leaving both men on bases.
Mieehan opened the ball with a corking
single to ceijtcr field, and Lewis fol
lowed with a three-base drive to left.
Dyer took first on balls, Harvey's error
gave Russell a life, Young hit safely
and three runs come in. 11 its by Lewis,
Dyer, and White brought in one in the
second, and Jeff's hit and a couple ol
errors added another in the third. Stan
ford failed to score in the fourth,
though Lewis made his usual hit.
For three innings Berkeley failed to
score. In the fourth C. Klston was
given a lile by Lewis' wild throw of his
grounder. Then Harvey put the ball
into right center for two bases and Kl-j
ston came home. Harvey went third j
on a pass ball and scored on White's
fumble of lloag's hard-hit grounder.
lu "the awful fifth" Stanford re
sumed the run-getting and added a I
' n |
couple more to the score on Young's
base on balls, Ilarrelson's two bagger,
and Johnson's error.
Shcchan aud Lewis opened the sixth
with a safe hit apiece, upon which
Captain Bond retired from the box iu
favor of Ilarvey. Dyer found the
change of pitchers quite to his liking'
and brought in Shcehan and Lewis with
a nicc two-base hit to center. He him
self scored a few moments later when
Bond at first base let Hussfll's grounder
go through him.
Jeff hit safely in the seventh, but a
double play by Berkeley prevented fur
ther scoring in this inning.
Singles by Lewis, Dyer, and White j
brought in another run in the eighth.
McLaine took things easy in the |
uinth, and I'. C. was allow* d to make!
