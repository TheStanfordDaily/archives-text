The Junior class i.s puttiug forth
strenuous efforts to make its celebra
lion to bo held next Friday an un
qualified success. Up to date all has
been scrtno with the exception of
a little tilt now and then between
the actors and the athletes over pri
oiity of right to monopolize the af
ternoon of the eventful day. It is
needless to state that the long-haired
actors were bested in the struggle;
but now all Las been settled, and
everybody is beaming with the plea
sure of anticipation over the great

tliiDga to be seen and lieard when
the band begins to play.
But the unexpected happens even
in the preparation fora Junior Day
potlach. It was the intention of
tho field-day committee to allow free
admission to the afternoon games, as
the receipts from the farce and hop
were calculated to defray the entire
expenses of the day's celebration,
and a large crowd would insure a
successful meet. But, us usual, the
Student Body steps in at tho last
moment, after all the work has been
done, to make a twenty-five cent fee,
every cent of which goes into its
own coffers. The Junior Committee
have entered their protest but to no
avail. They were unwise enough to
lend the impression that- Friday's
meet was to be the nnuual Univer
sity Field-day, and that started the
pot boiling. Our elastic constitu
tion states that all Student Body
affairs shall be wholly controlled by
the officers of the association.
By a skillful manipulation of the
imagination, backed by the powers
that be, the Junior c'ass must there
fore turn the affair over at this late
date to tho-e who are surely entitled
to the gl ry of making it a failute—
for failure it wi 1 be if the students
are fore, d to pay a quarter to wit
nets it..
