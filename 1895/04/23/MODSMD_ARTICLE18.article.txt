Dr. Jordan received last week a
handsomely bound volume of 700 pages,
entitled" A Manual for the Study of
Insects" by Prof. John Henry Corn
stock and Anna Batsford Comstock. Its
purpose and plan are thus stated in the
preface: u For many years the most
pressing demand of teachers and learners
in entomology in this country has been
fora handbook by means of which the
names and relative affiuities of insects
may be determined in some such way
as plants are classified by the aid of the
well-known manuals of botany. But,
as the science of entomology is still in
its infancy, the preparation of such a
handbook has been impossible. Excel
lent treatises on particular groups ol
insects have been published; but no
general work including analytical keys
to all the orders and families has ap
peared. It is to meet this need that
this work has been prepared."
The book abounds in wood-cuts en
graved from nature, the work of the
junior author. Mrs. Comstock's friends
Itcre, from their knowledge of her pro
ficiency in that art, will readily under
stand what a prominent and attractive
leature of the work her engravings are.
They will doubtless attract much atten
tion among both scientists and engrav
ers. In addition to these, many parts
of the text are from her pen.
Prof. Comstock's recognized rank as
an authority iu entomology is assurance
of the thoroughness and scholarly char
acter of this new volume.
