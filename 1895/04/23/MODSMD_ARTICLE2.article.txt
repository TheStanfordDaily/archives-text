						Sunday Sermon.

Rev. E. P. Dennett preached in the
chapel Sunday. The sulject of his
discouiso was,"The Ultimate Law oi
Character,'' ami his text was .Matt, xix
—20, 21: "The young man saith unto
itiin, 'All these tiling have I kept, from
my youth uj; what, lack 1 yeij" Jesus
stiid uuto hiai, 'Come and follow me.' "
The men oi the Bible were not freaks
They did not belong to that curious
order of individuals who are eccentric
and who therefore represent no one hut
themselves They were representative
men and stood fora class.
In the first three gospels the story
of this young man is told, isi eucli it
is told in a different way, but from all
of them we learn that he had good birth,
ability, good breeding, character, and
faith, lie stands as a model of what
culture could do fora man—culture
which touches every part of the soul.
But we find him coming to Jesus, say
ing, "What lack 1 yet " There was
a sense of want that led him to come
alone to the only teacher that was at all
likely to answer this question. Most
men would have said to him, " You are
honest in an avaricious age, pure in a
world of baseness, believing in an age
of atheism. You are complete." But
Christ said, "Follow me." What did
this mean ? It meant saoriGcc.
Christ was so simple that he took tlie
little children in His arms, so wise that
with a lew words lie could quiet the
questionings ol the Pharisees, Uis
soul was as open as the waters of a
mountain stream; yet so deep that there
wire depths that lay beyond the sound

ing line and so broad that philosophers
have discovered in his teachings wis
dom that will be remembered when all
else is forgotten. It is easy in a broad
character like this to examine only one
scctiou of it end imagine we are follow
ing Christ. The significant fact is not that
lie was a teacher, but that lie loved us
and gave Himself for us. We arc apt
to go to the cross and say, 11 There lie
gave himself." He turned away from
every worldly call and gave over the ex
periences of Ilis life to men that they
might be restored to the spirit of son
ship.
Self-culture is necessary to give sig
nificance t) self-sacrifice. Each is
robbed of its significance without the
other. The poorest gilt is equal to the
<;reatcst before God; but in feeding the
poor and helping the sick, the widow's
mite was a mite still. Of how much
avail is devotion when it is accompanied
by poor capacities? St. Paul, Luther,
and Wesley found that self culture was
necessary; but culture without self
sacrifice does not help the wot Id. A
poor life dues more than the richest life
spent in selfishness. Christ, in speak
ing the words of our text, has told us
the inadequacy of culture, in this
nineteenth century civilization, while
we behold the great inventions and the
great wealth, on all sides we hear the
cry, "What lack I yet?" Oar own
upbuilding fails to satisfy the highest
moral ideal.
Selfil'nes9 is both gross and refined.
Whatever claims self-sufficiency is im
moral. Otherness is recognized by
culture, hut it is too frequently the
otherness that, claims the other for its
own sake. The otherness that God de
mands is for the sake of another. Cul
ture fails to be an adequate law of social
harmony. There is social disharmony
and strife everywhere Whatever is to
be the law of individual character will
be the law of social harmony. What
ever puts me in my own proper place
will adjust me to others. There
is no law of social harmony that
is not based on self-sacrifice.
We think of sacrifice as a sort of asceti
cism and always associate it with pov
erty. It has to do with riches, not
with poverty. We should expend our
wealth so that the poor can be raised.
In the spirit of Christ we should go
forth to bear one another's burdens.
Self-sacrifice is not an addition to
culture only, but it is the supremest
law of culture. There is that which
being spent, tends toward poverty; but
there is also that which increases with
the spending. Drudgery is blessed, but
more than that is needed. Inspiration
is necessary. And what can inspire us
like the need of a fellow man? The
word with which the lJible describes
character is "glorification." When
Christ was transfigured and the bright
light shown froiu his eyes and his gar
ments gleamed with whiteness, it was
the glorification of a noble soul. (Jive
and with thy giving thou thyself shalt
be enriched and qlorified.
