# "The Present Status and the Future Chances of the Laborer."

### 
Prof. Uernard Moses of the University
of California. delivered the Tuesday lec
ture in the chapel last night. The lec
ture was the presentation of one phase
of the organization of society which
Pres. Jordan has been considering in
his class in Evolution under the sub
ject of Altruism. The chapel was filled,
and the address was enjoyed by all.
lie spoke as follows:
In the discussion of the social ques
tion there are two distinct methods.
In the first case, a person looks upon
the history of social changes and seeks
to formulate some general truths about
society which their history may per
chance reveal. In the other the per
son conceives an ideal of society which
he prefers to all others and works lor
its realization. The firr-t 1 will con
sider.
Unrest among (he laboring class
does not presuppose oppression, for in
the United States the condition of labor
is better than in any other place. Prof
Hr)ce says that the laborer in the
United States is the highest that labor
ers have ever attained. The truth of
the statement is seen when comparing
their status in other countries. In the
advanced couutries wc hear that the
laborers see a favorable outlook and
compluin. This complaint will con
tinue as long as they see an attainable
aim. The view of these aims makes
the world move to more pei feet activity
In early society the laborer was a
slave. The first step up was to a medi
aeval serf. After this came a stage of so
ciety where the laborers were indepen
dent and unorganized. Since then the
laborer has gone through two steps:
First he was subjected to an employer,
where he remained until the beginning
of the present century. The second
carries us over the industrial revolution
and the introduction of steam and
machinery. Larger capital was neces
sary. Competitive corporations were
the neccessary result. The personal
employer no longer exists except in
meuial labor. There is no personal
sympathy between the employer and
employee.
The employees arc united for the
conflict, There is no rule to properly
distribute the products, and distribution
is done without system. Politic illy in
the United States the conflict is settled
at the polls. In Spanish America it
generally results in a physical conflict
Socially the latest conflict is settled
amicably, not by vast armies, but peace
ably.
This indicates a new feature of social
organization. Laborers believe that the
employers will not give them their due
unless some superior power compels
thetn to do eo. Generally two forms of
conflict arc shown: Organization of
labor to withdraw Irom work, by which
the laborers do not use force. The
other ib to form exclusive associations
and rely on force by making all laborers
join (bom They do this because they

do not have faith in legal forcc. War
may strengthen patriotism, honor, and
independence, but the achievements of
laborers will in the future be, as in the
past, by bloodless conflicts. History
shows that all social questions have been
settled without force.
IStrong internal movement and deter
mined ambition, however, advance the
status of the classes.
So to the future chances of labor, it
is necessary to consider the laborer in a
society, which is the outcome of the
past and present. The progress of civ
ilization is marked by progress from
general to special trades and employ
ment. The most important cause of
this is a more complete unity of society.
After work is completed, it must be
united to be useful; so industrial society
is unified. Every step forward pro
duces harmonious unity. This is true
in all departments of human effort. In
the lower stages of civilization each man
may be independent and self-suflicing,
but iu modern society the members are
inter-related.
The popular mind considers the state
something to pluuder. The state is,
however, organized fora purpose.
Political society has divisions of labor,
as iudutrial societyâ€”divisions made for
economy's sake. Some consider theen
largmeut of co-opcration as scciilistic.
The influences which tend toward
eulightenmcut may produce new soci
ety, If there was presented to early
society a scheme of social order as
exists today, they would have turned
as<de and said that it demanded a
different society than that wl.ich ex
isted. But new relations arise from
age to age. From indications we can
see the new society of the immediate"
future. Every reform is the outlook of
some Utopian scheme. To build a new
social theory, an ideal condition is
unnecessary to be taken as an aim. We
cannot tell what the conditions of soci
ety in the distant future will be; for it
may be entirely transformed as in the
past. Immediate results, however, on
the basis of the present, can be pre
dicted. Most reforms for socialistic so
ciety argue from fancy without taking
into consideration the present and its
tendency. There are tendencies tow
ard making society socialistic, but it
does not appear reasonable that society
will be carried on to a socialistic status.
Under socialism each oue must keep
time with his neighbor. Under the
existing conditions, the individual can
work as he pleases.
Among all the instances of socialism
there has been no mark of social equal
ity. When men arc free to manage
private capital there are ways to achieve
position, but under socialism the same
desire exists; the whole population
would be competitors for office. On
the other hand exacting rigorous rules
would be necessary for preservation.
Socialism will not give freedom.
There are no tendencies in present
society to point toward equality of
society and socialism. The principle

of dependence and interdependence is
the tendency of the time. Private
enterprise is the organization of society,
not socialism. There is no indication
that the struggle for life will cease, and
so long as this is true i-ociulism cannot
exist.
