This mlÂ»-lit body of any college
owes a debt of loyalty to the institu
tion. It in nut merely a matter of
pajinu your money and taking your
draught from the Pierian spring.
Wl en a man identifies himself with
a university he tacitly gives his
pledge to support its interests and to
repay by his loyalty the things be
yond money and beyond price which
he has taken with him or should
have taken with him when he leaves
the institution. We of Stanford,
from the character and traditions of
the University, are bound in an es
pecial degree to suppoit her best in
terests
All this means something just now.
A8 tliu summer approaches the con
ditions become encouraging for the
growth ut that noxious weed, the sum
mer lie. There is no organized resis
tance during the summer season to any
report detrimen al to the University,
no authentic manner of refuting any
ruuior whatsoever, be it as sensa
tional and as absurd as some of the
stories that went the rounds last
year.
Now is the time to display our
loyalty. Let eveiy Stanford man or
woman who is on tliu Pacific Coast
this summer take especial pains to
refute any absurd or untiue lumor.
