Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
By request we furnish the following
statement in regaid to Junior Day Ath
leties.
During the past season we expended
nearly $1000 in placing the best track
team possible against U. C. Through
unfortunate circumstances the total re
ceipts from games has been less than
BHO. It has been the intention of the
management throughout the year, to
hold a varsity field-day where the
trophies would be given, University
records established, and at the same
time some funds secured with which to
discharge some very pressing obliga
tions.
By request of the Junior Day Com
mittee the captain placed the date on
Junior Day and the management began
arrangements for the trophies aud med
als. It seems that the Junior Commit
tee did not understand that the Student
Body might be in need of funds to con
duct athletics and that it conducts its
own affairs, and so ruled that no admis
sion should be charged.
Consequently, to avoid unpleasant re
sults, the Varsity Feld day will be given
May 11, and the trophy and medals se
cured will be given then. This leaves
the Junior Day Committee free to make
ucxt Friday a handicap field-day, thus
leaving more entertainment than the
scratch events of a Varsity trial.
Respectfully, G. T. Bancroft,
I). E Bhown,
L. J. 111MSD1LL,
11. C. Hoover.
