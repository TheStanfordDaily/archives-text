The need of the University in the
wuy of original sorgs with oiiginal
music has been recognized by several
students, and they have composed
some pieces which might become
popular were they given proper con
sideration. At present,however,there
is no way to determine whether a
song shall lÂ»e adopted by the Uni
versity or not. It has beuu sug
gested that a committee selected by
the Student Body upon all
songs submitted, and that their de
cision in the matter be final. This
seems a good way out of the diffi
culty, and should at least be consid
ered at a Student J3odv meeting.
