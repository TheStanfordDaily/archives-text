# Gymnasium Exhibition.
## 
### 
A gymnasium exhibition will be
in the Encina gymnasium on Fri
day evening, May 3. Fencing will be
one of the features of the evening, and
there will be the usual tumbling, trap
eze acts, and horizontal and parallel bar
performances. Those who intend to
take part, are practicing daily, and the
affair, being the first of the kind given
on the campus, will doubtless prove a
success.
