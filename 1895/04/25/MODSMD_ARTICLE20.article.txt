# Football Benefit.
## 
### 
Dr. Jordan will lecture in the chapel
Monday evening a' 7:30 for the benefit
of the Athletic Association. " The
Yellowstoue National Park" is one of
his best and most popular lectures, and
special interest will be added by the
exhibition of a remarkably fine set of
views. Dr. Jordan's work in the Park at
different times in the past in the inter
ests of the United States Fish Commis
sion has given him unusually good oppor
tunities to become familiar with it.
The receipts are to be devoted to
football.
