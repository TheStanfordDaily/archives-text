# Junior Day Festivities.
## 
### 
The Juniors have had their say and
have said it well. Despite the fact that
they have been bleeding the students at
every turn during the past few months,
enough bought tickets for the farce and
hop last Friday to insure the day's suc
cess financially, and if there was a tinge
of failure on the other side of the ques
tion, t he Class of' 96 may console itself I
in the thought that bad weather was!
i he cause of it all.
A lone visitor on the campus Fri
day would have been aware of some
coin mot ion, but his last thought would
have been that a Class of 96 celebra
tH>n was going on. One of the most
pleasing attractious at the production ot
i lie Farce in the morning was the ar
tistically arranged electric '95 which
overhung the beautiful stage-settings.
I lie '96 engineers pride themselves on
the unique design. Hearing that theie
whs to he no field-day in the afternoon on
account of a lack of entiies, several pat
riotic Pioneers bared tlieir pedal ex
iiciuities to the wind and rain and ear
ned on a field-day amongst themselves
until the crowd dwindled away to the
participants only.
The evening Hop was a cosmopolitan
affair, and can he looked upon as the
crowning social success ot the year.
The extremely inartistic ir)uinasium
was t'linsimmed into a huge bower
thiough the prolusion of its decorations.
Large Japanese lanterns, umbrellas, and
tropical palms added to the general
beauty, the tasty arrangements being
due » hii fly to the work of VV. L Mc-
G u ire.
The refreshments and music could
not have been better, and the floor was
perfect. A novelty in the way of
music was introduced by having band
music for the two-steps, the orchestra
pl.i\inir for the waltzes. The Class of
96 can congratulate themselves on the
unqualified success of their hop.
