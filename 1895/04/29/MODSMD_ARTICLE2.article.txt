# The
						Junior Farce.
## 
### 
The production of the Farce on
Junior l>iy put even "Pinafore" in the
shade so far as mechanism went. The
gymnasium was already garnished with
the tasteful decorations that made the
Hop in the evening so inviting. The
electric lighting was elaborate and the
scenery most effective. The reproduc
tion of Lagunita in the third scene was
the most elaborate scenic at
tempt we have had yet, not excepting
- 9i's quadrangle, and when the curtain
rose it was greeted with deserved ap
plause. But all these accessories merely
served to set off the merit of the Farce
and its production. Miss Coimtock
has certainly brought credit to tier side
of the student body by her clever writ
ing for Juuior Hay. Her farce was es
sentially college in its tone; it abounded
with bright lines, eutertaining situa
tions, arid last, but not least, that dar
ling of the groundlings, the local hit
In this last respect, by the way, all
previous efforts were outdone, with the
possible exception of the first year's
panoramic farce, and the audience was
not, slow to show its appreciation, al
though sometimes there waa an embar
rassment of riches, the okes following
too rapidly upon each other to be fully
grasped.
A general outline of the Farce is as
follows: Phil Farnsworth (Baldwin),
the type of the college fellow whose
ideals are not uncomfortably high, has
met a "queen," a Miss Carson, whose
presence at the Junior Hop is the one
thing that can make life endurable.
But fate stands in the way in the per
son of Miss Bancker of Frisco (Miss
Comstock) who has already been invited
sometime during a dim and unsophis
ticated past. Phil rises to the occa
sion with the intellectual assistance of
Ted Stunning (AlcGrew), the proverb
ial room-mate who is infinitely more
serviceable on the gymnasium stage
than be usuail) proves in renl life,
and a letter is sent to Miss Bancker,
containing a tale of woe with a broken
ankle as the motif. This is to be fol
lowed with a tc!im run to Mi>s Carson

to "come on the 6:30 " The sudden
approach of that prince of terrors, the
laundry-man, leaves tho unaddressed
telegram alone on the table, where Phil's
sister Cardie (Miss Steffens) finds it
and by thoughtfully sending it to the
wrong girl, Miss Banckcr proves the old
adage, "What is college without a sis
ter?"
The second scene opens with a "feast"
at Itoble in houor ot Miss Bancker, who
has come "on the 6:30." Upon this
hilarious(?) scene the lights go out with
characteristic suddenness (one of the
most natural touches in the play), and to
the horror of the girls the masculine
voice of Phil issues from the sudden
darkness. This scene sorely taxed the
dramatic probability of the action and
was only equalled by the final determina
tion of two such swell girls to i»o to the
hop with a fellow who danced like Busty.
Phil is desperate, for he has discovered
the loss of the precious telegram; so
judge of his feelings when the only re
sponse to his questioning is the sudden
oncoming of the lights and the reve a-

tion of Miss Bancker standing before
hiui. The situation is a trying one and
Phil does just what any man under the
circumstances would do—swears.
The third scene is laid on the banks
of Lagunita where Phil enters a boat
race and wins it in spite of his mental
anguish and a compromising ankle, li
is now that Miss Bancker, the unex
pected guest, leads by mistake a tele
frOni Miss Carson, the other factor in
Phil's perplexity, stating that she could
not accept the invitation already sent
before the miscarried telegram. But
this does not resolve the complications;
its only function is to explain to Miss
Bancker's entire satisfaction the broken
ankle of young Farnsworth. Both Phil
and his room mate are guilty souls;
their Nemesis stands to the right of
center practicing his steps. Through
the play Josiah Busty ( Brown ) has
moved unobstructively but convincingly.
He belongs to the genus "hobo" and is

victimized by both the young rascalts
who now stand near liiin. Under the
delusion (bat Cardie is smitteu with
liiin be invites ber to tbe Junior Ilop,
and takes a dancing lesson I'roui tbe two
villains tbat keeps him up until four
o'olock that morning applying the prin
ciples. In this third sCene be stands
unconsciously going through the
intricate steps of the waltz in his own
peculiar way, while Phil and Ted laujzh
at him openly. Then comes a check on
their mirth when Cardie overwhelms
them with the announcement that she
and Miss Bancker have been invited to
tbe Ilop by Rusty and will prefer bis
company to their own. The curtain goes
down in the good old way upon the
punishment of the evil doers and the
reward of simple virtue.
There is nothing but praise to fiive
to those who took the various parts out
lined above, and space doc.-! not permit
a detailed notice, 'li e effret of tbe
coach was hhov. u in many ways, and tbe
whole p< IfiiHiiHiico went oil Rnoothly.

Brown c arried off the honors as Josiah
Rusty, and although a character part i.s
easier than the typical, he deserves
special praise for his impersonation.
Miss Comstock and Geo. Baldwin were
both entirely satisfactory in their re
spective parts and gave to them all that
the parts called lor. Miss Stiffens and
J. T. McGrew were both good, although
inferior to the others in enunciation.
Cochran and Mies Williams furnished
entertainment with their singing of the
author's clever songs, Miss Williams
causing a certain impersonator to hide
his diminished head. The co-eds and
l'i Ufes could have given the "Pina
fore" chorus points on naturalness and
freedom from stiffness.
Altogether the Juniors are to be con
gratulated and the Sophomores ex
horted, and all who have colletje theat
ricals deeply at heart are in the best of
humor.
