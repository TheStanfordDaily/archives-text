# The 						Sunday Sermon.

### 
On Sunday last llev. Alfred Mom
erie of Loudon addressed the congrega
tion on the subject of bigots.
" If I be lifted up, 1 will draw all
men unto me." Is there any truth that
this prediction is liable to be fulfilled?
Who was Christ? What was his aim?
Let us go to church history for an
answer. We learn of the fierce war
that has been waged as to whether
Christ was the same as the father, or
similar to the Father. In the Greek
there is a difference of one letter be
tween the two words, and the difference
that it makes to humanity is about as
important as the size of the letter. It
is inconceivable that our conduct could
be made better if we knew. Century
utter century bishops and fathers of the
('atholic faith have kept on arguing
,t nd philosophizing about doctrines
which have no bearing on human life.
'I he Athanasian crced still disfigures
<he Kuglish prayer book. It is a state
ment of the doctrine of the divine in
carnation, distinguishing the three per
sons of the Cod head by asserting that
Cod was not created or begotten, that
Christ, was not created but begotten,
and that, the Holy Ghost was neither
created nor begotten. Who of us
knows what is meant by the procession
of the Holy Ghost? And yet this is
the Catholic faith, which unhss a man
believe, he cannot be saved.
Suppose we examine the conduct of
Christ s disciples. They aie baptised,
learn the catechism, receive commun
ion. In ten thousand eases, that is the
only perceptible dtfferenej between
those who call themselves Christians
ntid those who do not. Nothing could
induce them to use a needle on Sunday,
but they will spend the whole after
noon spoiling a neighbor's reputation.
They bow low at the name of Jesus,
yet he interests them less than Bis
iiiMtck. Men calling themselves t'hiis
tians have maintained that a whole life
of sinfulness could be washed away by
tlte mere act of conversion; that it was
only justice to burn at the stake those
who differed from them; and that Cod
created men for the ex pi ess purpose of
throwing the wicked into hell that he
might be glorified. H this is what
Christ intended, he was the meanest
mid worst of the sons of men. Were
men not bad enough? Lift him up in
his hideousness. He will be covered
with everlasting shame.
Now let us go to the only reliable
source —the New Testament. John
sums tip the whole of Christ's teach
ings in one word—Love. "A new com
mandment I give unto you—that you
love one another." He had nothing
else to command. "Come!'* Why? lie
cause you attended early services? No;
because *' I was ahungered and ye
gave me meat; I was athirst and ye
gave me drink," In the far off future
when he is understood do you not
think his kingdom will stand ?
Jesus is the Savior, not a savior.
"There is none other name under

Heaven whereby ye can be
saved." I would riot coudemu those
prophets who have preceded Christ.
Least of all would he wish it. Yet he
was greater than all on account of his
plan of salvation through love. But
his beauty lias been hidden from us
through the mists of ignorance, and he
has been caricatured by fanatics. Some
of us have heard, rising clear above the
discords, the harmony of love. Some
of us have not heard it. But discords
shall cease. Christ shall be lilted np,
shall be explained from every pulpit,
and extolled by every heart as the in
spirer of love.
