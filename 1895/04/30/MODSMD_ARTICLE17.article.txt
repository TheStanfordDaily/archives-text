The graduating class is making fin
eft'ort to make Corainencement week
a round of pleasures. Heretofore
there has been no other attraction
ihitu the Senior Farce and Hop,
which composed the observance of
» lass Day. Thin year the week will i
be made shorter by two day a and |
every remaining day will be filled
with something to do. The two
days before Sunday will be given to
events of minor importance to the
general public. The Seniors will
play the annual game with the Fac
ulty on Friday afternoon. It will
be an occasion «>f memories on both

Hides, thoughts of the first year when
both teams met frequently. In the
eveuiug the Faculty gives its annual
receplion to the graduating class,
and this promises to be an elaborate
affair. Saturday is to be given up'
to the under-class men who are ex->
pected to form a precedent in the way |
of a cane presentation and the bury
ing of the hatchet between the new
Juniors aud the new Sophomores
who on this day will blos
som out in all the glory of the)
sophomore canes. I'robably an
impromptu dance will be given i
by the young ladies at Roble. Sun- j
day will bring the baccaluureate j
sermon and a quiet afternoon. Then 1
011 Monday morning the week proper (
begins with the production of '-Pin
afore" for the Liildebrand Library
in the gymnasium in the morning,
the exercises at the class tree in the
afternoon when 'l>s will afiix its
plate and stamp the tree as its own;
and in the evening the Senior Hop.
Tuesday is Alumni Day, when the
Alumni Association will hold inter
esting exercites in the morning and
a reception to '95 in the afternoon.
Then in the evening vull come the
crowning event of the week. The
commitue has in t >et made this
public because arrangements are not
entiiely completed Init the idea is a
tine one and if cariied out will be
lung remembered. Tins will be
something to which every student
will be invited and which will also
be of especial interest to outsiders.
After this event the ('lass of '1)5 will
have a grand torchlight rally and in
a body bid larewell 10 the different
buildings on the campus. With the
Commencement, exercises Wednea
day morning ,( J5 will have merged
into the alumni and become a thing
of the past.
Such are the plans for Commence
ment week, the beginning, let us
hope, of annual festivity and reun
ion. 'I he success of the undertaking
will dei cnd entirely upon the spirit
ill which the plans ale met. If the
rest of the stu lent body evinces u
determination to leave the Univer
sity and let the graduating class take
care of its own week then of course
the enterprise must be given up un
til some other class shall find the at
titude different. So far the senti
ment of the students seems to be
that of stajiug for the four days
entertainment, and the eventful
week promises to be the success that
is hoped for it.
