Alreadv the freshmen so soon to
blossom into sophomores are talking
of the "good time coming" when
they will do their share toward wel
< oming '99 in true sophomore style.
The conversation in any group of
'!)8 men is sure sooner or later to
turn to reminiscer ees of the good
old times last fall, and shrill-voiced
freshmen are practicing the'-Freshie
in a high chair 'yell which sent such
thrills of terror down their own
backs that night when they crept
over to the chapel to organize.
It, would be a shame to deprive
either *08 or '99 of any of their pro
spective fun, but we feel bound to
repeat a warning which appeared in
these cjlumns after an unfortunate
squabble at an interclass game. l)o
not overdo this "rushing." A long
succession of interclass bickerings
continued throughout the whole
year is entirely too much. The two
present undergraduate classes have,
it is tiue, been generally more in
clined to treat the matter moderately
than any former freshmen and soph
omores, but there is still plenty of
room for improvement. One or two
big rushes arranged for beforehand
and fought out fairly would settle
the question as well as the contin
ual struggles which have been the
rule heretofore.
Let '90 and '97 arrange next year
for one big decisive contest; let the
underclassmen turn out in a body
and settle the question of muscular
supremacy, then let us drop the mat
ter for the year.
