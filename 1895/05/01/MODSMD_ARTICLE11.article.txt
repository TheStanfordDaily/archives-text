If the Letkeley papers can lind
something to rail at besides tlie al
lowed general inferiority of Stanford
we would like to have them make
use of it. For the last few weeks
the editorial columns of the Occi
ilmf and the BrrlcJ't/an have been

filled vvitli a sweeping and general
denunciation of Stanford and all
things which belong to Stanford.
For bitterness and general unfair
ness an article in a late Occident will
serve as an example. The article
begins:
No doubt the innocence of the
Stanford journalists was gravely
shocked by the direct charge of pro
fessionalism made by the Berlccleyun
against their truck captain and
c} clers.
Now this is news. If the editor
of the Occident will glunce over the
files of the Berkeley an he will find
that the article in question charged
our track captain and cj clers only
with employing professional tactics
—surely quite a different thing from
a direct charge of piofessionalism,
even were tlie Berkeleyon s ground
less statements true.
Our Berkeley friend, after re-as
seiting the statements
to the efft ct that Dpzier wus with
drawn from the bicycle race on ac
count of a plan to disable him, closes
the article as follows:
Whether the Mispieion was justi
fied or not, it cnu be a source of
little gratification to our intercolleg
iate rivals to know that the reputa
tion of certain of their number is so
noisome as to warrant su'-h proceed
ings on our part. Now, as to the facts
in the case, they are simply these:
sworn testimony is at hand to the
effect that the reason advanced for
keeping Dozier out of the race wan
the correct and only one.
The final sentence of this effusion
is such an excellent specimen ot
Berkeley English that we have not,
ap yet, been able to unravel its true
meaning. Does the editor of the
Occident mean simply that the afore
said " sworn testimony " proves that
the TJ. (J. track management gave
these charges of intendt d foul play
as the reasou for withdrawing Doz
ier? Or does he mean that this
*' sworn testimony " proves these
charges true? If the former is the
true interpretation, it does not con
cern us. If, however, the Occident
means to assert that this testimony
proves that our cyclers entered the
two mile cycle race with the inten
tion of crippling or injuring Dozier,
we directly challenge the track man
agement of the Iniveruitv of Cali
fornia to produce the affidavits of
such testimony.
