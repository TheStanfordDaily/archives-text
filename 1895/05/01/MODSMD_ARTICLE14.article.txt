Editor Daily Palo Alto.
Dear Sir:—l should like, through the
columns of your paper, to extend my
warmest thanks to the students of the
belaud Stanford Junior University for
I lie cordiality and kindliness of the wel
come accorded me as a representative of
the University of California in the
Caruot Medal Contest. Having beeu
unable to see my colleagues since, 1
cannot authoritatively speak for them,
although I am sure they would gladly
join me in expressing our appreciation
of the friendliness with which we were
received. Prior to the contest a friend
of mine informed me that I should
doubtless leave Stanford with many
more friends than 1 had upon my arrival;
and when 1 had come to the chapel
Friday evening, heard the familiar
" IJ. (J. Berkeley," and our efforts had
been received with such evident appre
ciation, 1 felt that I was indeed among
friends. I am sure that a stranger
could not have distinguished the repre
sentatives of Berkeley from those of
Stanford by the conduct of the au
dience.
1 can say no more except to express
my regret that this being my last year
at college, I shall not have the oppor
tunity of welcoming your representa
tives to Herkeley next year.
Again extending to you my warmest
thanks, I am, Very sincerely yours,
Albert Wares Lyseb.
