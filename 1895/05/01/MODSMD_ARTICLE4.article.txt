# Pessimism.
## 
### 
Dr. Alfred Monierie, the celebrated
divine from England, gave the weekly
lecture iu the chapel last night. An
unusually large audience was present,
many being unable to obtain seating
room. It was one of the best lectures
given this year. In substance he
said:
Pessimism is the doctrine of despair
which asserts that life at the best is not
worth the living. It is a state of mind
which can exist only in thoughtful and
sympathetic persons. The world pre
sents itself to many as one of pleasure
and happiness. It is interrupted by
shocks. Most men recover from these
shocks, but in some cases men become
morbid, evil becomes a fact of existence*
they dwell in it and brood on it until
they can think of nothing else.
Several systems of philosophy have
been produced on this basis, Schopen
hauer sought to prove that ihe world is
overbalanced by evil and pain, lie as
serts that suffering is the very essence
of our life. We are ever striving for
happiness. All life is full of cravings
and want. Kveiy momentary pleasure
is followed by pain Ilartman says the
world is the result of blind folly. Hut
these views are radically (alse.
I will present (our arguments against
pessimism.
The pessimists take an exaggerated
view of existence. They assert that
pleasure is preceded by pain. This is
contradictory. We all have proofs of
this in our own existence. Ilartman
says that men maguify the value of life.
The vast majority of men find so much
pleasure in life that they are glad to
| live. His theory is false.
Pessimists ignore many of the most
■ promineut pleasures in life, ilartmau
! takes no notice of' intellectual pleasure,
which the student derives from his
labors. Laughter is one of the best
things in all life. Of these the pessi
mists take no notice.
Pessimism overlooks the necessity for
| pain. When it is asked, When we
j were made, why were we not made sus
j ceptible to pleasure and insusceptible to
pain? that is reasoning like drawing a
line without ends. It is impossible. It
is one of the impossibilities of God by
which he becomes worthy of the name
God. Infinite gooduess means infinite
restraint. God may be helping us by
allowing us to suffer —it being necessary
for our development. Pain is necessary
for the possibility of the end.
Pessimism bus a false id«'a of life. It
does not approve of a rational idea of
development.
There are two ideas of life; one of
rest and one of progress. The pessi
mists seem to believe that the ideal life
is one of rest. Cau this be true? Is
not the highest life yet to be attained?
To know and live we must experience.
Ilest is pleasure but are not the pleas
ures of action prcater? Who would
sleep in preference to the pleasures of
| hunting? Satisfaction is the content
ment of a low notion. The possibility

of eudless progress is the highest en
dowment of the noblest life.
Pessimism implies during the courn
of evolution no progress has been made,
or only a progress in pain. With life
came waste in the evolution of the
world. Animal life came accompanied
by pain. Have the pessimists never
heard of love? It, can be traced
through all life, and yet the pessimists
say that the world was made only by
pain. Love is the payment of pain.
Ihe pain is fully compensated by the
love.
Pessimism as a belief is silly, for its
foundation principle is that life is not
worth living. Some men pride them
selves on their pessimism. There is no
delicacy in it. It is abnormal. It is
not tlie sign of culture. It is a disease
and it must be cured. How? Look
on the bright side of life. If you an
going to exaggerate, exaggerate the
bright side rather than the daik.
