A long-existing, urgent need of the
elementary student of insects and of the
teacher of entomology has at last been
relieved. Professor and Mrs. Com
stock's "Manual for the Study of In
sects," just published, makes easily ac
cessible a special field of systematic zo
ology which heretofore has been diffi
cult to enter. The appalling number
of ,-pecies of insects — half a million have
been described, far more than the
known living species in all other an
imals combined—and the common prac
tice of entomological systematic* of
limiting their studies to some one order
of in.-ects, have combined to defer fora
long time the preparation of a geneial
manual of systematic entomology,
hven now in this pioneer manual the
the family rather than the genus, to
M»y nothing of the species, must be the
unit in 'he synopses and analytical
tallies. But when a monograph of tho
three families of butterflies alone must
imike several very portly volumes, as a
well-known example attests, one is con
tent to accept fora while family units.
'I hat manual of the insect spjeies of
North America which shall be compar
able in exhaustion with (1 ray's manual
of the plant species or (Jones' key to
the bird species or Jordan's manual of
vertebrates would have to be wheeled
about the library or laboratory in an ex
press wagon, which is riot feasible.
There are 50 OUU described in.-eols in
North America and probably as many
more as yet unchrtstened. In this
statement of facts there may be some
excuse for the occasional hesitation tf
the insect- student when demanded to
furnish, out of hand, full name arid re
liable biographical detail of " the bu>i,
black and rather short, which we miw
in our garden."
The Manual of TOpages contains an
elementary account of insect morphol
ogy. physiology, and ontogeny, a brief
statement of the principles of zoological
classification, and an account of the
characteiistics of all the orders and
principal families of insects Synopses
and analytical tables, making practical
the determination to family of auy
North American insect,, are given, urid
are the conspicuously valuable part of
the hook in its relation to the laboratory.
In addition, a large number of the com
mon insect species are so simply but
adequately described and accurately il
lustrated as to make their determina
tion possible by the untrained but in
terested observer of insects. This fea
ture of t he hook will make it useful to
many who wish to learn to know the
common insects of field and garden, but
have no opportunity lor the special
training necessary to use the analytical
tables. In the selection of the common
forms for discussion, special attention
is given the more important injurious
species, and the accounts of their life

history and the means for combatting
them are sufficient to make an effective
resistance to them possible by the flower
and fruit- and graiu-grower.
To the entomologist the large amount
of original work displayed in the Man
ual will be conspicuous. One hardly
looks to a text-book for much else of
originality than that of arrangement or
treatment. Hut in the parts of the
Mauual devoted to the classification of
the butterflies and moths, of the flies,
and of the hymenoptera, the results of
Prof. Comstock's investigations of
homologies in wing venation are appar
ent,. The attempt made to introduce a
uniform nomenclature for the wing
veins, based on a study of their modifi
cations in the various orders, ought to
be heartily received by entomologists.
The illustrations, which help so
greatly in making comprehensible the
references to morphological characters,
and ia making the determination of
specific forms possible thus inestimably
enhancing the usefulness and value of
the book, are mostly the work of Mrs.
Com3tock. There are six full page
plates, one colored, and 797 numbered
figures of which a majority are wood
engravings. The beautiful figures of
the butterflies and moths recall those
pioneer American wood-engravings of
insects made by Henry Marsh for Har
ris's "Insects Injurious to Vegetation,''
the most attractive of early books about
insects The making of the engravings
for the Manual has busied Mrs. Cotii
btoek fur many years but for many more
years they will be the standard by
which insect illustrations will be judged.
The make-up of the book is pleasing.
It is printed from lar<je type on heavy
calendered paper with wide margins,
ajd is bound in lavender cloih with sil
ver lettering and vignettes. The dainty
vignette on the front cover is the partly
completed orb-web of a familiar garden
spider. The book is published by the
authors. The printing wasdone by the
Trow Directory Co. (New York), printers
ot Scribitfu H Miiynzine.
