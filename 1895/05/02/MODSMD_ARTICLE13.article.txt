I he outcome of some of the
pointed remarks in the Berkeley an
nual leads one to question seriously
whether material of such a character
should find any place in a college an
nual. In defense of the inseition of
such articles it may be urged that
they enliven the book, create an in
terest in it, and make it sell. These
aie the recognized arguments in favor
of it. On the other hand, it must
be admitted that these " grinds"
lower rather than raise the tone of
the annual. They often savor of

the t-illy and senseless remarks that
till the columns of many high school
papers, and instead of being a step
forward in dignity, such an should
characterize university students, they
are a step backward. Their fun is
not haimless, as the recent "Blue and
Gold " trouble testifies. If it were,
there would be less cause for objec
tion. But this seldom happens. In
the editors' desire to get something
that will amuse and create great
interest they often overstep the
bouuds of courtesy and dignity.
The temporary pleasure that some
who are treated in the " grinds " ex
perience from seeing tlnir names in
print does not olivet the wounded
feelings of others who feel that the
reflections upou them are uujust
and unmerited. There are many
other ways to euliven an annual
without resorting to '• grinds."
