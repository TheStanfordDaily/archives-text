# Election of Co-Op. Directors.
## 
### 
As the election for directors of the
Co-Operative Association is to be held
tomorrow it may be well to explain the
method of balloting used.
The by-laws of the Association read
(Art. VIII., Sec. 1): At all elections
of the directors of the Association each
shareholder shall be entitled to vote
either in person or by proxy in accord- i
auce with sections 307 and 312 of the;
Civil Code of California.
The sections referred to above are
as follows:
Sec. 307, Civil Code.—All elections j
must be by ballot, and every stockholder i
shall have the right to vote in person
or by proxy the number of shares stand
ing to his name, as provided in Sec.
312 of the Civil Code, for as many per
sons as there are directors to be elected,
or to cumulate said shares and give one
candidate as many votes as the number
of directors multiplied by the number
of his shares of stock shall equal, or to
distribute them on the same priuciple
among as many candidates as he shall
think fit. In corporations having uo
capital stock, each member of the cor
poration may cast as many votes for one
director as there are directors to be
elected or may distribute the same
among any or all of the candidates, in
either case the directors receiving the
highest number of votes shall be de
clared elected.
Sec. 312.—At all elections, or votes
had for any purpose, there must be a
majority of the subscribed capital stcck
or of the members, represented either in
person or by proxy in writing. Every
person actiug therein (in person, or b)
proxy or representative) must be a
member thereof, or a bona fide stock
holder, having stock in his own name
on the stock books of the corporation at
least ten days prior to the election.
Any vote or election had other than
in accordance with the provisions ol
this article is voidable at the instance
of absent (or any) stockholders or mem
bers, and may be set aside by petition
to the district court of the county where
the same is held. Any regular or called
meeting ol the stockholders or members
may adjourn from day to day, or from
time to time, if, for any reason, there is
not present a majority of the subscribed
stock or members, or no election had,
such adjournment and the reasons
therefor being recorded in the journal
of the proceedings of the board of di
rectors.
These sections may be summed up as
follows:
Each person can east as many votes
as there are directors to be elected, and
votes may be cast in any way the voter
desires; to illustrate: In the Co-Op
Association there are uine directors to
be elected; a voter may cast oue vote
for each of nine persons, or nine votes
for one person, or divide the nine votes
up in any way that he pleases.
