It is intended that the evening shall

for the evening, and it lias beeu ar

gymnasium. Mr. R. W. Campbell,
chairman of the committee, will have
charge of the conveyances, and be re

him, either verbally or by mail, with
the address of the lady whom be is to

Many tickets are being sold, and it is
requested that all those intending to
purchase tickets will do so at once so
that arrangements as to refreshments
can be concluded. There will be four
teen dances; the price of tickets one
dollar and a half. They can be ob
tained from Messrs. Campbell, Cochran ,
