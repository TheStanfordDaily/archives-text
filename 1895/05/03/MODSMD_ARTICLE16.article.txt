There has been a great deal ol
complaint about the tilling of dance
programs befoie the liops. It may
cetm a trilliug affair bur, i*, caused
inconvenience and some dis
appointment and It is
thoughtful in a man to provide
against his young lady's being a wall
flower, but when he goes so far as to
rush around the quad days before a
dance aud chase boys asking if they
"won't please take a waltz with my
i:itl t " the affair becomes embarassing
on all sides.
