# The 						Sunday Sermon.

### 
The sermon Sunday morning was
preached by Mrs. Eliza T. Wilkes of
the First Unitarian Church of Oakland.
The subject was"The Forgiveness of
Sins in the Light of Evolution."
Do not think I do not realize the aw
ful presumption of speaking to you on
such a subject. A short time ago a
minister asked me if I believed in evo
lution. I said most certainly I did so
far as I had gone, Sin has been con
sidered the choice of the imperfect for
the perfect. Today most of us regard
it as a crime against life. Your body,
complete in every function, is a mode!
body. Violating anything which re
tardes this, is sin; retarding life is im
morality and bin. Hying to live is lull
complete life. A criminal lias more to
hope for than the licentious person.
We see all around us the results of sin.
It is as much a sin to think wrong as it
is to do wrong.
Evolutiou. with its awful fact of her
edity, emphasizes the old law that the
father's sins descend upon the children.
Children suffer for sins not only of the
lather but of the third and fourth gen
erations. It emphasizes th#» curse
against wrong-doers. We are not liv
ing in a universe cf goodness. Hell
cannot be put off. "Whatever a man
snweth that he reapeth." Are we held
hand and foot in the inexorable grip of
vice? Cannot we get free? Must the
prodigal sen be striken from the gospel's
payes? True, there are no longer any
punishments left in our philosophy,
unly consequences Are there no evan
gelists for us to see? Are there none
to save the captive and to help the lost?
A few months ago I was preaching
in a room over a saloon. A friend who
always waited to see me home was
standing in the doorway. I preached
on the well known subject, "Salvation
Through Character." My sermon
sounded void and empty, but when I
reached the door my friend, who drinks,
gambles, and according to the old say
ing, "whose worst enemy is himself,'
said, "I like those sermons on charac
ter, but how about us poor devils who
haven't any?" We must ask that ques
tion or stop preaching. If the philoso
pher can not help those poor ones who
need help we had better stop and
tell again the old, old story.
Life has in it a recreating force.
Life brings to us sweetest results:
it takes the scar and destroys every
sign. Every great thought clearing
the brain gives new recreative force,
puts new life into the very scum of
things. Through intellect aud affec
tion, new life comes to fainting souls.
Every new burst of emotion arouses
the will, and it is through action alone
that character arises. We change our
lives by our wills. Our destinies are
in our own hands. "What thou lovest
thou bccomest." Moral power has in it
the life principle of recreating. The
worst consequences of sins are the
breaking down of intellect and charac
ter. When one's soul has come to sin

all the beauty of the present time is
left behind. The great power is a
loving power. But how docs one know
it? Only through the touch of human
love. You may talk to some who know
not of love, but every soul forgives sins.
The consequence of sin is distrust in
other hearts.
Some one spoke to me of the fate of
poor women who had sinned. I could
not think how to help them. I was in
fluenced by another'* sin. Oneofthem
came to me. At first I could say
nothing, but. my own soul helped
me. Though our hearts hasten to Cal
vary, shall we pass by those who waut
us to help them?
I stoou by a poor girl who was suf
fering for her own and another's sin.
I said, "God will forgive " ''Yes,"she
auswered, "God will forgive,but women
won't" There are sins which can never
be forgiven in this world or the world
to come; but out of this loss come uew
hope and spiritual gain. They become
monuments of love, faith, and trust in
fellow men.
As I finished talking to her, they sent
for me to go and see a man. I found
him in a dark, gloomy corner of our beau
tiful city—a wreck, apparently, lie had
sown to the wiud and was reaping the
whirlwind, lie had done what many
young men are doing—he had "sown
his wild oats." He was what we should
call a delicate man; used the vernacular
which learned men use; he was a col
lege man. "I got off the wrong way,"
he said, "I want to know how to get
hold of life anew. I can't see a clear
way." He told me that all through
these years his one true friend had been
his little wife, and now for her sake he
wanted to begin life again. I said:
"My friend, I can't help you to begin
life anew. Reap what you have sown.
There is no power in Heaven or on
earth that can give you back these
years. Hut God isn't in a hurry; there
is pleuty of time. Take hold of
that wife's faith in you and
it will help you. And in after years
you will say you have gained much,
you have been helped to carry charac
ter to a higher level. Remember this—
the universe is before you waiting to
raise the will of man when be is ready."
When I had finished I thought it would
have been better to say, "Except ye
become as a little child, ye cannot enter
into the kingdom of heaven."
