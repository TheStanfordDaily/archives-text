'I he honor bestowed by Judge
Meyrick and Messrs. Olney and Page
upon the college men chosen by the
University of California and Stanford
to represent them in the last Inter
collegiate Debate can but have a
salutory effect upon the future of
such contests. When men of the
standing of these three judges show
themselves eager to honor as their
guests the young collegians who
nave proved their ability in debate,
the time is brought so much the
nearer when the debater will share
with the football men the lionizing
hitherto the monopoly of the latter.
