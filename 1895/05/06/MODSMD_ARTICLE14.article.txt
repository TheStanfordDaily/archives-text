Senator Perkins has not gone at
the mutter of encouraging forennies
in the two universities in any half

hearted manner. His offer of a
total of six hundred dollars to
the best debaters is evidence
of the reality of bis iuterest.
The prizes themselves, and, much
j more, the hor or of winning
! them, will doubtlet-s give a great im
j petus to debating both here and at
Berkeley. By bis generosity and
iuterest in college affairs Senator
Perkins has established himself still
more firmly in the respect and ad
miration that college men feel for
him.
There is one danger in the future
of debating in the plan proposed by
Senator Perkins; namely, the de
struction of "team work" by the rneu
representing each university. If the
prize is to be given to the man mak
ing the best debate of his side in the
intercollegiate contest, it becomes
necessary for each man to work in
dependent of his collengues. This
one thing would be fatal to true inter
collegiate trials, but doubtless some
way can be devised to avoid this dis
advantage. One way would be to
award the hundred dollars to the
three men winning places on the
Intercollegiate; another, to award
the whole amount to the best de
bater, his rank to be determined in
the preliminary debates.
