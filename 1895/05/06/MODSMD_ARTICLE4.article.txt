# The 						Senator Perkins Prize in Debate.
## 
### 
At the breakfast given last Saturday
noon at the University Club in San
Francisco by the judges to the six rep
resentatives of the two universities in
the Intercollegiate Debate an announce
ment of great interest to all debaters of
the two universities was made. It was
in the form of a letter from Senator
Perkins in which he declared his inten
tion of offering a prize of $100 to the
best debater on each side of the Inter
collegiate Debates for the next three
yearsâ€”a total of $000. Ry the end of
this time the Examiner cup will have
been won permanently; and Senator
Perkius intimated an intention of theu
providing some new incentive not less
generous.
