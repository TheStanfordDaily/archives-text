The Committee ou Commencement
Week has sent a request to the presi
dents of the Sophomore and Freshman
clauses to call meetings to decide what,
shall be done with Saturday the 25th,
which lias been set aside for the tw<i
under classes. The program is left en
tirely to t.he people coucerned, but the
Committee offers one suggestion. Thi
year's Commencement week isau inaug
uration, and now is the time to start
what precedents we can.
It is suggested that the two classes
inaugurate the custom of an annual
Cane Presentation. The cane itself,
the emblem of Sophomore dignity,
could be a very large and handsome
stick with a plate of some kind telling
what it is. This would be presented
formally each year by the president of
the new Juniors to the presideut of tht
new Sophomores. The date and the
names of the presidents should be
carved on the stick each year, so that
in time the stick would carry a long
list of names. The man receiving tl.*-
oane should be considered the 4 custo
dian" for the sophomore year} it would
be his duty to deposit the emblem it:
the trophy room of the Museum, from
which he would take it at the end «>t
the year when the time came for it to
be handed down to the next clai»s.
This custom would tend to make the
presidencies of both classes for the
second semesters of their respective
years offices with extra honors attached
to theui. The names upon the cane
would appear in the Annual each year
as the list grows longer.
This would be the proper day f«.r
the treshmau class, having adopted its
class cane for the ensuing year, to
christen it on the campus before taking
it home to swing during vacation After
the presentation some such ritual a.*
burying the hatchet, etc., might l«-
gotten up. The expense involved is
trifling. Everything must have its be
ginning, and this custom, started this
year, however simply, would associate
the names of '97 and '98 with the Uni
versity's first Commencement week,
and inaugurate a custom that is bound
to grow into an important event.
These suggestions are submitted to
the classes for consideration. The Com
mittee voices the general sentiment that
'97 and '98 should make good use ol
the day set apart for them.
