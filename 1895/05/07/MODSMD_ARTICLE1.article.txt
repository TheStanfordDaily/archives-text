# The 						New Annual.

### 
Vol. II of the Quadj which is to he
placed on sale tomorrow at 12 m. sharp,
is a handsomely bound book of some
260 page 9. It contains three short tto
»ies, a couple of biographical sketches
with portraits, and twenty-five pages of
verse. The editors are to be congratu
lated that, they may include in the lat
ter Prof. Newcomer's Ode, which Stan,
ford people will be particularly glad to
>eo printed in permanent form. The
rhymes and jingles scattered through
the book are unusually amusing, and
nhow that the Muse, like the rest of us,
has lots of fun at college. The artists
have done themselves proud, and their
numerous clever sketches have done
much to make the book one of the best
college annuals ever issued. The draw
ings are not only very creditable pro
ductions in themselves, but have an in
dividuality and local interest ordinarily
wanting in drawings turned out by the
dozen by professional designers. In
iliis respect we have a decided advant
age over our frieuds across the bay, for
the very raison d'etre of a college an
nual is the outlet thus given for local
talent, artistic as well as literary and
musical. The value of the book is not
an absolute one, but depends in a great
part, on our interest in its makers, and
we should no more think of hiring our
drawing done than our rhyming and
"joshing."
The book contains the usual statistics;
records of athletic events; accounts of
the different organizations among stu
dents and faculty; fraternity lists, etc.
It is well worth having for this reason
alone, Hnce most of the information is
to be found nowhere else. This last
will not apply to the motto of the Jun
ior class, however. The statement
labor vincit omnia (including of course
'!>(>) has appeared in print before.
We note with no small relief that
copyrights and injunctions have not left
the book entirely destitute of mirth.
Ou the contrary, there are more grinds
this year than last, when the funny
man roamed the quad, in search of
prey with a careless indifference to the
strong arm of the law.
