Tiie Memorial Pay outing at Mon
terey is an assured fact, 'lhe largest
excursion ever lun from the campus
will leave the quadrangle early next
Tuesday morning, and if you do not
go you are losing a splendid oppor
tunity to visit, at a nominal cost,
une of the Edenboweisof the world.
The old mission at Monterey, the
seventeen-mile driveway, the pebble
I each, anl shaded paths will evi
dence Hue California luxuriance.
This is a raro chance to combine
pleasure rest, and instruction.

On Friday next the residents in the
men's dormitory are to elect another
set of candidates from which one and
possibly two committeemen will be
chosen by the faculty. Now if stu
dent control of their own dormitory
is to oe successful, every precaution
must be taken to choose only such
men as will not be content to draw
their salary only, but will recollect the
duties and responsibilities entrusted
to them by their fellow boarders
They will take pains to know just
where student funds are invested
and just what returns come from
such investment. There has been
altogether too much indifference of
committeemen of late; they content
themselves with an occasional visit
to the office, but afford little satis
faction thereby to those who have a
right to expect more.
It was suggested when the system
was first tried that there might be
danger in making committeemen
only those to whom financial assist
ance would be welcome. There
were many who asserted that the
best and moyt energetic managers
were more likely to be found amcng
those who were not dependent on
the place for any aid. No one can
deny, however, that whenever it is
possible, the best plan is to elect
men to the committee whose sole
object is to benefit the entire student
body residing in the dormitory.
This must be done for the good of
the whole system, though it may
work a hardship on isolated cases.
Every effort should be made to
have the Hall room rent reduced
next year, and with the dormitory
filled much lower rates could be
given. There is every prospect at
present that such a reduction will be
made.
