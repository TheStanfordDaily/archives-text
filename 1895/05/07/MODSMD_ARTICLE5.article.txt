# A 						Demurrer Filed.

### 
Mrs. Stanford through her attorneys
yesterday filed a demurrer to the
$15,000,000 claim of the Government
against the Stanford estate. Amoug
other things the demurrer alleges as fol
lows:
That it appears upon the face of the
bill that the only obligation or liability
ever created in favor of the Govern
ment against the Central Pacific and
Western Pacific railroads was on the
bonds, and the bonds do not constitute
a debt against either of the corporations,
or a right to demand payment from
them ou their failure to redeem the
bonds. The relief of the Government
lies in the confiscation of the property
of the two companies. It appears on
the face of the bill that no valid claim
was ever presented to Leland Stanford
in his lifetime or to his widow after his
decease, which fact invalidates any
claim the Government might have
had.
Notwithstanding that the Govern
ment alleges that the bonds were issued
against the two companies of which
Stanford was a stockholder, the bonds
were issued twenty-five years before the
death of Stanford, and consequently
suit is barred by the statute of limita
tions Further,
That it appears by the complain
ant's own showing by said bill that to
have or maintain this action, the Gov
ernment ought not to have redress, be
cause it appears that the cause of action
set forth in said bill accrued and fully
matured more than three years ago, to
wit: twenty-five years before the com
mencement of this action and before
the exhibiting of said bill agtiinst this
respondant, under Section 859 of the
Code of Civil Procedure of California.
