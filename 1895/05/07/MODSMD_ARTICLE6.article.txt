### 
Those who are interested in classical
literature and have taken greatest inter
est in the collection of a rare library for
this University will be pleased to learn
that the llildebrand Library has been
shipped from Hamburg by way of New
Orleans. It is expected to arrive
before the end of the month, as the ship
ment was made on the 20th of April,
So great was the desire to keep the
precious collection in Germany that
after Stanford University had fully de
cided to take it, and so cabled the hold
ers, the Prussian minister of education
renewed negotiations for the purchase of
the library. The llildebrand treasure
is rich in the works of Goethe and
Schiller, and bo auxious were the direct
ors of the Goethe-Schiller archives at
Weimar to gain possession of these
works that they were desirous of buy
idg the entire library. Another offer
was made for the collection by a lead
ing German bookseller who offered 30,-
000 marks for the books composing it.
Stauford is to bo congratulated on hav
ing made the purchase as reasonably as
she did.
Many other great universities were
negotiating for the library and the
cablegram of this institution was for
tunately received by the library's own
ers before the University of Pennsyl
vania and Hryn Mawr had telegraphed
for it, which they did a short time after
Stanford had accepted the offered sale.
