# THE
						BATTLE OF SHILOH.
## With Some Personal Reminiscences. 
### 
Mr. Warren Olney gave a carefully
prepared account of the battle of Shi
loh in the chapel last night. He had
been in the battle and spoke from his
own personal experience and from a
study of the literature of the disputed
points.
Mr. Olney was a private in the
Third lowa Infantry and went to the
vicinity of Pittsburg Lauding eight
months after enlistment. Shiloh was
really the first great battle of the war,
and many disputes have arisen over the
position of the forces.
The Union forces were camped with
out order or system, each occupying
any suitable ground. Troops were con
tinually arriving, some freshly recruited
and not familiar with their arms.
With proper precaution the place se
lected for the concentration of our
army could have been rendered impreg
nable within a few hours. Why this
was not done is hard to answer. The
only explanation he could conjecture
throws out of the inexperience of the of
ficers in command.
General Johnston was smarting under
the criticisms of the campaign which
resulted in the loss of Donaldson, and
at Shiloh his resolution was to conquer
or die. The Union forces knew that
the enemy were at Corinth, but there
had been no intimation of advance.
Their generals did not realize the ser
iousness of the position. Their army
on the day before the battle was cool
and peaceful.
Mr. Olney then gave the story of the
battle. He showed on a map the po
sitions and movements of the troops and
the advances of the enemy. He told
how he himself fared while under fire,
and made the description very interest
ing with criticisms and episodes of the
occasion. From the regiment in which
he fought but 150 men reported after
the battle; au average for the other reg
iments. He said that defeat would
have been certain to the Union had not
the Confederate general, Johnston,
been killed. In the battle the forces at
first were about equal, but on accouut
of Union stampedes the Confederates
were in the preponderance.
The results of the battle were not
great. It was too near a draw. The
South for the first time realized that
all the Northerners loved their country
more than their lives.
The dead demonstrated that we had
a country and a race worthy to take the
lead in the march of human advance
ment.
