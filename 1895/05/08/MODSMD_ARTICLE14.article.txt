The gymnasium exhibition 6et for
Thursday night is deserving of every
encouragement. In these days of
tierce athletic contests we are too
likely to overlook all-round develop
ment. The average athlete trains
violently for the development o! one
set of muscles, and then takes a rest
for the remainder of the year. The
set of muscles which come into play
in his own field of sport are de
veloped, in consequence, out of all
proportion. True, there are some
athletes who engage in two or three
different kinds of sports, but such
men are the exception.
The ultimate aim of all exercises
should be not only momentary pleas
ure; it should have for an object the
building up of a correct physique
and the conserving of vitality. Any
thing which tends to develop in one
direction only defeats these ends.

A football player with one shoulder
higher tliau the other, or a round
shouldered baseball player, is a poor
argument for our modern athletics.
If the gymnasium exhibition can
do anything to encourage systematic
exercise with a view toward good
all-round development, it will not
have existed in vain.
