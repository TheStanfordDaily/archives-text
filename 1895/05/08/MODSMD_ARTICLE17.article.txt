The following is the letter in which
Senator Perkins offered the prizes in
debate announced in Monday's issue:
San Francisco, May 1, 1895.
Mr. Warren Olney:
Dear Sir—Referring to your remark
on the Oakland boat this morning that
you wished you could find some one who
would given $200 dollars a year for
three years to be divided between the
two best speakeis at the annual Inter
collegiate Debate between the students
from Stanford and from the University
of California, it strikes me that your
wishes in the matter are very moderate;
and as I am in most hearty sympathy
with the movement to encourage the
students of these two great universities
in their intellectual contests, I shall
consider it an honor to contribute the
sum desired. Therefore, please bring
it to the attention of the proper parties
that at each annual Intercollegiate De
bate in 1896, 1897, and 1898 the
judges are authorized to draw on me
for $200 to be equally divided by them
between a Stanford debater and a Uni
versity of California debater.
The judges, in addition to rendering
a decision as required by the gift of the
Examiner cup, will also select from
each side the speaker who, in their
opinion, is best entitled to the money
prize. The judges shall take into con
>ideration both excellence of argument
und delivery.
In case the Examiner cup is awarded
before 1898 no doubt there will be some
other general prize to contend for, and |
my agreement remains open if there is.
I want to add a few words expressive
of my deep interest in these intercollegi
ate debates. In the East they attract
much attention and are largely attended.
They are proving to be a great stimu
lus to the investigation and discussion
amoug students of live questions in
finance and government.
As you know, it is one of my hob
bies that government by discussion is
the ouly government possible fora i'ree
people. There are continually arising
for solution new problems in economics
und sociology. The educated men of
the country should be the leaders in
these discussions and will be if the stu
dents in our colleges are trained to
think* correctly and to express their
ideas with clearness and force.
In so far as the educated men and
women of this country fail to occupy
their natural place in the front, by so
much have the colleges in the land
failed in their work. There has been
a failure in the past, or if not a failure
there have been woful shortcomings, on
the part of the alumni, to fill the places
they ought to occupy. If they cannot
occupy the front ranks in the march of
improvement, then there is something
wrong in their training.
It is said that those of us who have
been wholly without the opportunity of
obtaining any college drill are not com
petent tojcriticise; my reply is that we
naturally expect to be surpassed by
those whose advantages were so much
greater than ours, and that we realize
more vividly the benefits that may and
ought to be obtained by college educa
tion than those who have it. When
we say that college men do not, on the
whole, occupy the place that naturally
belongs to them, wo claim that we, as
outsiders, arc as competent critics as
the college men themselves.
Believing as I do, that the discussion
by young men of the questions of the
day will tend to develop right thinking,
forcible speaking, and thereby insure
good government, I am glad to contrib
ute anything that will act as a stimulus.
The amount of money is small, but to
be earned as the students will earn it
ought to be an honor. May the best
men get it! With kindest regards, I
remain cordially yours,
George C. Perkins.
