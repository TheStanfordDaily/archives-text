### 
A meeting of the Graduate Club was
held t»n Monday afternoon, at which
important subjects were discussed.
Mr. .J C. Kirtland Jr was elected
an Stanford's representative on the
hoard of editors of the Handbook of
Graduate Cour-os for 1805—90, which
is t> he publirJied by the associated
graduate clubs of the United States.
A committee was appointed to con
sider the question of arranging for some
social function in the near future.
The names of'a number of the fac
ulty were proposed for honorary mem
bership. It was the general feeling as
expressed in the meeting that since the
club represents the graduate depart
ment of the Uuiversity, it should in
clude in its membership all the gradu
ate students of the Uuiversity. It is
hoped that all graduates who desire to
become members will send in their
names to the secretary, and that as
many as possible will do so before
Thursday at 4:30 p.m , that they may
be presented to the Executive Commit
tee at that time.
