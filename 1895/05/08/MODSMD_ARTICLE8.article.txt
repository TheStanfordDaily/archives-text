# The
						Olympic Games.
## 
### 
All Ilellas had poured forth upon
the broad valley of the gym to witness
the great games of the '95 Olympiad.
The pride and flower of Grecian civili
zation had assembled to honor the as
pirants for the laurel crown. Among
the fashionables gathered upon the
scene were all those whose names had
appeared in the annual white book the
day before and whose social position
was assured. A traveller from Phoe
nicia asking his elbow-neighbor the
names of some of the notables was as
tonished at the greatness of those about
him. There was Pollocles, the
Attic Beau Brummel and the apostle
of independence, speaking with
authority upon matters of state.
A bevy of Athenian maidens clad in
bloomers of some rare Persian stuff,
were gathered excitedly about their
Adonis, Bankroft, who for some reason
had not entered the games. These
maidens stood erect and on guard, fora
rumor was afloat that Erbix, the no
torious, was in the crowd. Seated high
above the crowd were the great trium
virate, holding in their hands all offices,
including the box office. Among the
four hundred was Amilton, the irre
proachable, his attire, as usual, <h rig.
Uuder a splendid canopy which ex
cluded the rays of the noon-day sun,
reclined the luxurious llai, grand vizier
of Babylon, his feet in sandals, and the
ripeness of the Orient shining in his
nose. Among the gilded youth circu
lated Nox, the merchaut with innumer
able garments for sale.
The Phoenician, gazing in awe at
these personages, suddenly heard a vast
shout rise from the plaih, and 10, the
contestants entered, glowing in the
beauty of their youth and freshness
As they came out into view of the mul
titude, Konnik of Corinth touched his
lyre and the others with him also, and
sweet mueic rose to all-seeing Zeus.
First came the serial dive, beautiful,
bewildering, like the sacred snake of
India in its convolutions, or like those
that move sinuously on the road from
Mayfield. Then rose the pyramid, to the
applause of the homesick Egyptians in
the crowd. Higher and higher it rose
into the clear air, and lo! at the base of
it was the Herculean Kauphmanos, the
Scythian, he who with mighty hands
had conquered the knolls, the wells, and
the deep rivers of the earth until they
yielded him tribute.
On the horizontal bar revolved the
sinewy Gamma like to a Macguirean
wheel in its swiftness, and
I'harnires and I'hlemiggos revolved
too, and turned and twisted
until the vestal virgins howled with
delight. Then came riding in twj un
known knights upon full-muscled
steeds, one of whom bore the copy
righted name that appeareth not in the
expurgated editions. Manfully did
these two do battle, and then slow music
sounded while the corpses retired.
Wonderful were the feats next seen
upon the parallel bars, and then came

the Reckless One, in an exhibition
that shamed the Greeks of old with
their wooden horse in fated Troy. Now
came the swordsmeu, some of them
native Greeks, and some intruders
from beyond the sea. This was
followed by tumbling, more wonderful
than lvauphmanos when a joke reacheth
him. Then came Etherington, sur
named the Patient, and swung clubs
so well that oxeyed, domestic Juno be
came jealous of the man and sped down
the sides of Olympus,
Then while the maidens held their
breath and made eyes of love, appeared
upon the plain the mighty Sandow, the
strong man from the Macedonian pas
tures, bearing the marx of many a
struggle. Strong was be and shaped
like a dream; his lower limbs
were strangers to (jreece a^d (
his muscles were out of sight.
Long and deep were the female sighs
that stirred the air, and lo! when the
act was over, it was found that lleiken
bak had died of a broken heart.
Now followed two winged creatures
upon the eerial rings, and when this
act was over, and the setting sun lin
gered on the empty plain, where only
the trampled grass gave evidence ot
many feet, a lone traveler from
Phoenicia, whose initials were N. ft.,
found that the elephant he had tended
so long had vanished, and in its place
he beheld a weak and puny oue, per
haps a day old, which did not belong
to him.
