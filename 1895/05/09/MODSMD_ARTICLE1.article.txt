## Definite Preparations for '95's Farewell. 
### 
i'he p la us lor tiie first Commence
ment week have taken dt finite shape and
tin-I'm is prospect ol unusual gayety dur
«'»K tlie days tliat intervene between
ilie ending ol" recitations on the 21th
una the conferring ot degrees on the
morning of the 29th.
i lie week of festivity begins with
Friday afternoon when the last rec
itation is over for the term. The in
augural event is one that has found a
strong attraction in past 3ears, anu
which this year will have an especial
interest. This is the great annual
game when the Faculty and Seniors
cross hats and eud their struggles on
the baseball field. This year the men
who will play will not meet for the
first time. I lining the opening year
such »amcs were frequent; in those
days the student team was composed
largely of the freshmen who are now on
the eve of their departuie. Only those
pr .1 'cssors who were here the first and
second years will participate in the
irHine. The Faculty nine will consist
«»l Angell p, Kichardson c, Murray ss,
Jordan lit, Howard 2b, Wood oh,
Marx <•{, Anderson If, Wing rf.
It is rumored that the faculty are
rehearsing a sensational yell which is
expected to drown the notes of "Zuh,
//ih, Zeer " A return surprise even
more startling is a secrct with the
seniors, aud will prove not the least
t< iture of the event. The spectacle of
I u: ulty and students crossing bats is a
nov elty with the University so far as can
tie learned, and is vastly more entertain
ing than the foreign methods of annual
grinds and subsequent investigation.
l>r. Jordan will resurrect his pioneer
vest with its torn back lor the occasion
and other memorable features will not
be forgotten. This great game will
bring out the entire student body and
no one can afford to stay away.
In the evening whatever scrimmages
may have occurred during the game
will be forgotten in the elaborate re
ception to '1)5 by the ladies of the fac
ulty. The parlors of lloble Hall will
be decorated and refreshments will be
served in the lloble dining-room. The
parents of the graduating students will
be welcome to this affair, for which the
ladies have made such preparations as
to insure the triumphant success of the
evening.
•Saturday morning a mixed tourna
ment will be held on the Kncina courts.
Definite arrangements for the affair
will not be concluded until after the
ladies tournament to be held next Sat
urday. In the afternoon Mrs. Stan
ford gives a formal reception to the
Faculty and graduating class at her
town house 011 California street, San
Francisco. The invitations include a
round-trip tickctj the hours ol the re
ception will be from three to six. On
the campus in the afternoon the first
annual cane presentation will take place.
The committee appointed by the Soph

ouiorj class has gone into the matter en
thusiastically and will report its plans
to the class at the meeting tomorrow.
Its idea ior the cane is an exceedingly
happy one and the stick will he an orna
ament to the trophy room. This stick,
bearing a silver hand with the date and
names <>112 the presenter and receiver
engraved upon it, will he entrusted to
the (Mass of 'i)S with appropriate ad
dresses ir» the quadrangle. In the
evening the Class of '08 is invited to
meet with the Class of '07 at the
Frenchman's lake, where with elabor
ated ceremonial procession and oration
the hatchet will he consigned to the
dames of an immense bon-fire, accord
ing to modern ideas, cremation having
taken the place of burial, and the two
classes will smoke the pipe of peace
about the funeral pyre. In the box
with the hatchet will be placed sundry
articles of local interest which the
classes shall consider worthy of being
consigucd to oblivion. The effect of
this spectacle in the weird setting of the
curious lake, will be unique and the
custom will eclipse any cremation of
Bourdor or other ceremonialism in
vogue at other colleges.
The baccalaureate sermon will be
delivered on Sunday morning by Prof.
T. 11. Bacon of the University of Cali
fornia. At 10 o'clock on Monday
morning the tuneful choruses of Pina
fore will once more he heard freshened
with local hits and introductory busi
ness. Rehearsals have recommenced,
although the parts are found to be per
fect. The gymnasium, already decor
ated for the Senior Hop, will present a
gala appearance, and beside our own in
terest io it, the production will be a
revelation to the ftietids we have from
abroad, in the afternoon brief exer
cises will be held under the '05 oak
for the purpose of affixing to the tree
the Pioneer plate. These exercises will
consist of music, short addresses by
two of the faculty, the reading of the
class history, and remarks by the pres
idents of '05 and '00. On this occas
ion a prominent number of the law
classes will ivad the la>t will and testa
ment of '05 whereby the class be
queaths to the museum all those articles
of verlu which has made it famous dur
ing the past four years, and furnished
subject-matter for the college humor
ists.
Alter an opportunity for everybody
to rest a little, the Senior llitp will be
given in all its glory. The Junior Hop
will be difficult to beat, and the com
mittee arc working under many disad
vantages owing to the necessary use of
the gym for Pinafore on the day of the
hop, but they are sparing no effort to
outdo all previous affairs and the Uni
versity should g've the Imp its hearty
support.
On Tuesday morning the Alumni
hold a symposium on education, where
several alumni will speak, and to which
all are invited. The afternoon will be
occupied by the Alumni business meet
ing. Then in the evening will come the

climax of the week, in which everyone
has en equal interest. The first Com
mencement Promenade promises to be
an event for future history. The.quad
rangle will be the scene of unwonted
festivity, 'i'he young ladies have been
assigned their respective arcades, aud
in these they will hold informal recep
tions. The Alumni will decorate two
of the class rooms, where they will re
receive the class that is about to join
the ranks of the silent majority. These
rooms and the arcades, transformed by
the use of lanterns, furniture, rugs, and
potted plants into handsome bowers,
will give the quad an air of carnival.
The music will be a treat; it will consist
mostly of descriptive pieces, for which
thirty-five men have been found ne
cessary to give the desired effect. The
stcreopticon views cast upon one
of the University towers will
be a novel addition to the music,
and when various well - known
scenes aud people pass across the screen
to the air of"Auld Ling Syne," the
siifuiticance of the occasion will be felt
by all.
At. the close of the last selection the
Pioneer Class will equip itself with
lanterns and form iua grand valedictory
march to all the buildings on the
campus. All the old familiar places
will be given a farewell visit, and wheu
finally the line breaks it will be really
the end of'os's presence on the campus
On Wednesday morning the degrees
will be conferred and the name of Pio
neer will be only the memory of a former
presence to whom those who remain are
much indebted.
Such will be the first Commencement
week of this University. This year it
is only an experiment to 'nuugurate a
custom that must come sooner or later,
but it is evident already that the exper
iment is <i success.
