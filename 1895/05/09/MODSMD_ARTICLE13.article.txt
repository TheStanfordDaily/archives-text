Such exhibitions of generosity
coupled with interest in higher edu
cation as exhibited by tho Examiner,
Senator Perkins, and Baron de
Coubertin, contribute in a large
measure to the intellectual tone of
the students of a university. The
method that they have taken arouses
a deeper interest in live and practical
questions, and gives a more thorough
training in debate, than any other
method that might be employed.

Inestimable good both to a com
munity and to the students of a uni
versity results from such practical
demonstration of interest.
The offer cf Mr. David Lubin given
in another column is another grati
fying exhibition of this interest. It
will stimulate and encourage our
talent, and biing out the best tbere
is in those who teek to win the
prizes.
