The trip to be taken by the Man
dolin Club during the coming vaca
tion will be the longest yet taken by
any musical organization in the
University. Hitherto our musical
clubs have hesitated to go out of the
state on account of the expense in
volved, but as the University grows
ohhr such a barrier must be over
come. Next season, instead of look
ing only to the I'acitic Coast tor a
field, our clubs will probtbly make a
tour of the East. Amherst's glee,
banjo, an 1 mandoliu clubs ventured
to go to England last year, aud
though the undertaking was con
demned as being impracticable from
a financial standpoint, the clubs met
with pronounced success. Cornell
will iiiiike the same trip this year.
With these trips as a criterion, our
clubs may well dare to venture East,
wheie Stanford is becoming better
known and better represented each
year.
