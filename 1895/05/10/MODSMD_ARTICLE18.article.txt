AVk are glad to note the formation
of a Dramatic Club. It is one of
the institutions that Stanford most
needs. Higher education is often
criticized for its tendency to em
phasize scientitic and intellectual
talents at the expense of music, art,
and the drama. The ''theater" at
thie Univeisity should be radical,
and exclude no one of either sex who
has histrionic ability. If theatricals
are t) be a success, they must be
based upon dramatic, rather than
social qualifications. We are sure,
from the ( tiicers, that the club will
be sensible and successful.
