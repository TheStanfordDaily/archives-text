# Dramatic Club.

### 
The loug list of student organizations
has been increased in number by the
addition of a dramatic club. It is not
the purpose of the new organization to
promote the interests of amateur theat
ricals or to foster the ambition of would
be-actors; the primary object of the
club is, in view of the growing popular
ity of amateur theatricals, to be a source
of financial assistance to various worthy
enterprises which are dependent upon
student support; for instance, the Stu
dents' Guild. At the same time the
club will endeavor to raise the standard
of such entertainments, and so far as is
practicable, fullow the policy of the
"Mask and Wig," "Oork and Curls,"
and "Paint and Powder," the dramatic
clubs of the leading universities. The
new organization came into existence
yesterday and will be known as "Sword
and Sandals." The officers are 11. U.
Brown president, G. P. Baldwin secre
tary, 11. S Hicks manager. The
membership is limited to upperclass

men and includes Shirley Baker, C. K.
Field, Stratton, Kennedy, Simmons,
McGiew, and Cochran. The club pro
poses to give a benefit for the football
team next October.
