# Let the Hatchet Be Buried.
## 
### 
'J hj Sophomore Class has decidcd to
ask the Freshmen to co-operate in an
effort to add something to the enjoy
ment of Commencement week as well as
to add another college custjm to Stan
ford life.
It has long been a custom in older
universities to have the outgoing sopho
mores and the incoming sophomores
bury the hatchet and smoke the pipe of
peace as emblematic of the death of all
hostility between them. This is the
custom which '97 proposes to initiate.
It is proposed that on Saturday after
noon, May 25, the president of '97 pre
sent to the president of '98 the cane
which it is the special privilege of a
sophomore to carry. The cane pro
vided will be unique in material and
design. Each year at the time of pre
sentation a band of silver is to be put
upon the cane, bearing the namO£ M'
the presenting and receiving presidents.
This cane is to be in the custody of the
sophomore president and will be kept
in the Museum. It is not necessary to
speak of the ever-increasiug value of
such a trophy.
As for the hatchet burial (or crema
tion), that is to be a matter of joint
expense and management. One large
pipe, also of special design, will be
provided, which will bear the cane
company through the years of the cus
tom's growth. Ou Saturday evening
this part of the ceremony will be
carried out at Frenchman's lake, where
the two classes will be gathered in a
circle around a camp fire. The tower
and ruins of the lake will be appropri
ately used in the ceremony. When the
tribes are gathered, the chief of '97
will light the great pipe, take a puff
himself, and baud it to the chief of'9B;
after which it will be passed around
to the assembled braves, each taking a
puff Tobacco and pipes will be fur
nished, and while the pipe goes round
appropriate harangues will be given by
members of the Uuiversity classes
The bonfire will be utilized in cremat
ating the hatchet, and with the hatchet
anything else desired, the architect's
dog for instance—of course in effigy.
There is no reason why this should not
be made an event of great hilarity and
good nature. It opens a field for local
hits that is unlimited. Let '98 enter
into it with an enthusiasm that will
insure success, for without hearty co
operation it must be a failure.
