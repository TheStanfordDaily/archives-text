# Commencement Exercises.
## THE
						PIONEER CLASS IS NOW A MEMORY. One Hundred and Sixty-Seven Diplomas Granted. The Addresses in Full. 
### 
The great class of '95 has passed
into history. With the impressive
ceremonies held this morning in
Kncina gymnasium the Pioneers
bade farewell to all the old ties
which have bound them so closely
to this University for the past four
years. The graduating exercises
were a fitting wind up of the series
of celebrations which have charac
terized this, by far the most event
ful week in the University's his
tory.
After opening music and the in
vocation, Professor John M. Still
man delivered the annual com
mencement address on "Specializa
tion in Jiducation." PI is remarks
were as follows:
Education in the somewhat re
stricted sense in which we com
monly nse the term, is the syste
matic effort to economize and to
augment the mental and moral de
velopment of the individual. It
attempts to equip him at the least
possible cost of time and waste of
energy; with the most important
results of the accumulated thought
and experience of mankind. Its
highest aim is the fitting of the in
dividual to be of the greastest pos
sible service to the race. In gen
eral it is also true that the man fit
ted to be of the greatest service to
the race, is also best fitted to im
prove his own condition, and to
increase his own comfort and hap
piness. A system of education
which should ignore the first and
greater object -would contain the
seed of its own dessolution, for in
the long run society is banded to
gether against organized selfish
ness.
In former ages, systematic edu
cation was designed only for the
priesthood. Later it became also
a preparation for the other so-call
ed learned professions—law and
medicine, and a distinguishing
badge, an accomplishment, a lux
ury for the sons of gentlemen.
The " educated classes " formed a
"caste", and often a narrow and
a jealous caste. The increasd and
wider distribution of wealth and
the increasing demands of a pro
gressive civilization have tended to
break down the barriers hedging
an educated caste. Step by step
the conviction has gained ground
that education is the right of the
many rather than the privilege of
the few. Gradually society is be
coming convinced that universal
education, and a generous educa
tion is one of the few good things
of which there cannot be too much,
and the best paying investment for
her security and prosperity. The
immense sum expended from the
public treasury, or through private

munificence, for educational pur
pose: are capital which society has
invested not for individual benefit
at the expense of others, but for
her own best interests, and we may
depend upon it that in the end she ;
will see to it that she receives the !
full interest due, in terms of honest j
and efficient service rendered to'
the material development or the
social welfare of humanity.
It is evident that the methods
and materials of education must
| vary with the needs of the time and
the ever-changing conditions of
[civilization. The best education
j that could be devised in the seven
i teenth century differs from the best
that the nineteenth has developed,
and the twentieth century will
bring new requirements. To a
certain extent the education of to
day is the outgrowth from the past
conditions and past needs. On
the other hand, the best education
of today is the result of a more or
less successful effort to forecast the
conditions and requirements of the
future. It cannot be otherwise.
The youth now receiving instruc
tion in thousands of class rooms in
the T nited States are preparing for
: a life-work in the future, and, in so
far as maybe, their training has
been shaped to meet the probably
conditions of their social enviro
ments. From a study of the history
of the past and the conditions of the
present we endeavor to discover
tendencies of human thought and
action which will be influential in
determining the conditions of the
future. The more clearly these
tendencies can be discerned the
more successfully may be laid the
foundation of future usefulness.
The earnest teacher has faith in a
progressive development of human
society, however slow it may be,
and also in the possibility through
education of influencing this de
velopment. If lie has not the faith,
there is lacking an important
source of inspiration.
The problems then that face ad
vanced educators today are com
mensurate in their importance with
the problems which already con
front our civilization, or which
more or less distinctly are discern
ed through the mists which veil the
future.
The century now nearing its
close has been a period of unex
ampled material and industrial pro
gress, and I believe also of social
and political improvement as well.
Though we are confronted with
wholesale corruption, rascality, and
crime, it is yet reassuring to re
member that they are generally and
clearly recognized tobe corruption,
rascality, and crime, and not called
honesty, rectitude, and benefi
cence, even by the most corrupt
exponents of public opinion.
Many causes have conspired to
make the past century thus re
markable in its development; rapid
and cheap intercommunication of
ideas, railroads, steamships, tele
graph; but more than all the in
crease of education and the conse
quent emancipation of thought
from the thraldom of old philoso- 1
phies and dead dogmas.
The arising from the study of
natural and physical science has 1
played no small part in this stimu
lation of latent human possibilities.

Naturally there have arisen from
the changingconditionsof life, new
social, political, and industrial
pioblems, making necessary a more
varied and different educational
preparation. The great varity of
1 schools for general and special
I training, and the diversity of ideas
as to function and methods of educa
tion are evidence of the attempt to
j suit educational methods to the
i various needs of the* time.
The century soon to be ushered
| in will doubtless carry forward,
! perhaps still more rapidly, the in
! dustrial and material development
j of civilization. Its achievments
may be greater than those of the
; 19th; but it would be strange if the
the future century were not beset
with difficulties and dangers com
mensurate with the magnificence
of its promise in other directions.
I am no pessimist. I do not be-
I lieve the golden age of humanity
is past, that society is going from
bad to worse, and social anarchy
hovers over us—sometime to en
gulph the dissipated remains of
civilization. Nor, on the other
hand, am I ready to accept that
now at last we stand on the shores
; of Utopia, and that the ages of war,
social tyranny, and enthroned sel
| fishness are about to give place to
that era longed for by poets and
all ages—
" When the war-drum throbs no longer
And the hattlc llags arn fu'led
j In the parliament of man, the federa
tion of the world. "
Vet, slowly or rapidly, with per
haps many a pendulum swing of
progression and retrogression, we
must and do look forward to a
gradual improvement in social con
ditions, in political wisdom, in
honesty and in love for one's fel
low men. And it is to education
that we must look to make the
world of a hundred years hence a
little better on the average than as
we know it today. The problems
which are to confront the future
generations, more numerous and
more difficult, as the conditions of
life become more complex, must be
met by a more general education
of the people, and by education
better adapted to the needs of the
social organism. Problems already
face us which tax to the utmost
the knowledge and ability of the
best trained experts —problems af
fecting the mutual relations be
tween nations, international law,
international commerce or finance,
equally difficult questions of inter
nal administration—currency, ta
riff, taxation; the relation of the
government to the individual,
charities and correction — they
need not be further enumerated,
we all recognize them. Many
social questions once simply and
and easily regulated become more
difficult and of greater import
through the growing complexity
of the social machinery. Thus the
centralization of capital into mam
moth corporations or trusts, with
the power that springs from a more
than kingly wealth, has given rise
to questions of great public import
ance, questions which troubled but
little when competition was freer
and the relations of supply and de
mand less restricted. The state
has found itself compelled to in
terfere to protect the public from

the abuse of power by wealthy
, corporations, and perhaps no task
i before us is of greater importance
than that of protecting the public
from such organizations, and at the
same time protecting great busi
ness enterprises from an equally
unjust and tyrannous abuse of the
power of legislation. Concentra
tion of capital has made possible
| organization of labor for its own
protection, and here again a
I giant strength is aroused which
public policy must control, that it
I be not used against the rights of
! others, nor the welfare of the state.
The problems of civilization are
becoming more intricate with the
discovery of new fields of activity,
with the increasing development
of older professions and industries,
i and with more intimate interna
tional relations, commercial, finan
; cial and political. Every depart
ment of human thought and activ
| ity feels the impulse of this increas
ing complexity, and demands irr
consequence more thorough know
ledge and greater skill to deal with
the changing conditions.
How are we to acquire the wis
dom and ability to deal with such
questions on the basis of equity
and honesty and with intelligent
understanding of the factors in
volved in their settlement ? Only r
I am convinced, by the gradual
elevation of tlie people to a higher
average of honesty and intelli
gence, and further than that by
the thorough special training of a
larger number of men to act as
leaders of public opinion in their
respective branches of knowledge.
The greater the number of such
leaders, the more thorough their
training, and the more varied the
lines of thought in which such
leaders exists, the more rapid and
free from danger will be the march
of progress. When knowledge,
skill and integrity take the lead,
and public opinion is intelligent
enough to discriminate between
the voice of wisdom and the flat
tery and sophistry of the dema
gogue, then only may we look for
the realization of a reasonable
Utopia. Far from that goal as we
now are, it is nevertheless the part
of practical patriotism and human
ity to strive ever toward it, that we
may avoid to the greatest extent
possible the wrong solutions of
those ever-recurring problems of
society — ever-recurring because,
as has been well said —if a question
be not rightly settled it always
comes up again for settlement.
Two hundred years ago any
man of ability and of good school
ing for the time might readily have
mastered all that was then known
about steam engineering. Any
statesman of the time of Queen
Elizabeth might easily have learn
ed all that existed of international
law. How much greater the pre
paration now required to master
those branches? A similar in
crease in subject matter and in
complexity of relations, and a cor
responding need of more special
and more thorough training may
be found in all the sciences and
their applications, in mercantile
and manufacturing business, law,
medicine, statecraft", literature or
philosophy. Where a hundred?
years ago a fairly good preparatory
