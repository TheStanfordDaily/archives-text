# MRS. STANFORD'S RECEPTION.
## The 						Pioneer Class Royally Entertained by the Surviving Founder. 
### 
Last Saturday afternoon the
Stanford mansion on California
street,S an Francisco, was thrown
open to the Pioneers, faculty and
trustees of the University.
The magnificent parlors easily
accommodated the four hundred
guests present. The afternoon
was quickly spent in conversation,
luncheon, and in looking over the
priceless treasures which the late
Senator and Mrs. Stanford had
spent years in gathering together,
Not the least attractive feature of
it all was a marble bust of the boy
in whose memory the university
was founded. A huge Swiss or
chestrion furnished classical music
throughout the afternoon.
At 4:30 the guests assembled
in the large library to listen to a
few words by Mrs. Stanford. She
spoke as follows:
"It is with a far deeper feeling than
that of mere pleasure that I meet the
class of '95 in my home today. As I see
you all here, and as I talk to you, there
is uppermost in my mind the last time
we met together. It was in the spring
of 1892 when a large number of you
came one evening to call 011 us at our
home at Palo Alto. I was not alone
then. By my side was my dear hus
band, and I well recall the pleasure
your visit gave him, and I dare say you
recall some of his friendly words of wel
come.
All the students of the university
have a place in my esteem, but I can
never forget that the men and women of
this class of '95 were my husband's
friends, and for that reason if for 110
other, they have seemed personally
nearer to me. My husband often talked
over your future witli me, and ever
looked forward to being present at your
graduation, and to meeting you as we
meet today, 011 the eve of your leaving
the university to go out into the world.
I feel that his influence has been with
you and the university in the past, and
that it will ever continue with you in
the future.
It was always his desire to have im
pressed upon you the necessity for the
observance of the Golden Rule and the
fact of the existence of a beneficent
Creator. His address to you at the
opening of the University ended with
Solomon's words, "Remember now thy
Creator in the days of thy youth." I
would like you to remember this as
the wish of the founder of the behind
Stanford Jr. University.
I take this opportunity to thank you
for your loyalty to the University and
to myself during the trials of the past
two years. I have seen and felt it and
know that it is deep rooted among you.
It is from this knowledge, and from my
faith in you and the President and fac
ulty, that I have derived the strength
and determintaion that has enabled me
to carry on the work which my husband
leit for me to do. Your enthusiasm and
the devotion of the President and faculty
were infectious, and I have endeavored
to do my part as zealously as you have
done yours. I will not deny that we
have passtd through very many troub
lous times and more than one crisis
within the past two years, but with
God's help we have passed through them
successfully, and that fact gives me hope
and faith in the future. If I take you
somewhat into my confidence at this
time it is because I do not feel that
your connection with the University is
to cease when you leave it. On the con
trary, as alumni, you are more closely

connected with it than ever, because co
workers with the faculty and me.
The cloud that hangs over us now is
the pending Government suit. Should
it be decided against the estate I can at
present see no alternative but the clos
ing of the University, and should it be
long in litigation, the University re
sources will be much crippled. I have
done all that lies in my power to keep its
doors open, and have willingly made
many sacrifices. There is nothing to be
done now but to await the decision of
the courts. But I have a firm hope of
the ultimate triumph of truth and jus
tice, with an abiding faith in the all-wise
and merciful God, who rules all and
who does all things well.
I thank you for your presence here to
day. and, believe me, whatever betide,
I shall never forget the pioneor class of
'95.
Judge Spencer, of San Jose,
Chairman of the University Board
of Regents, followed with a few
well chosen words eulogistic of
the founders, and full of sound ad
vice to the outgoing class. J. T.
Langford, responded as president
of the Pioneer class. President
Jordan dismissed the gathering
with a short speech in which he
urged upon each graduate his con
secration to the university in its
times of crisis.
