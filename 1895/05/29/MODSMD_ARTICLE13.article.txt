# Season Baseball Average.
## 
### 
Below is given a summary of the
work of the individual players who have
represented Stanford on the diamond
this year. Only those who have played
in four games or more are recorded. It
can be easily seen that the average in
both fielding and batting are unusually
high. Harrelson leads with a fielding
average of,looo. Jeff heads (he batting
list with a percentage of 525. MeLaine's
pitching record does not show well 011
paper, although his work this year has
been of the highest order. The extreme
hardness of the home diamond has heen
the cause of many hits, which would
otherwise have been cut off by the in
lielders. The outfield has not been con
ducive to fast fielding either, thus mak
ing long hits much easier to obtain.
Good team work has characterized the
playing of the team during the past sea
son, and considering the loss of many
veteran players this year, Captain Dyer
may congratulate himself 011 the result
of his earnest efforts to bring together
the winning team.
