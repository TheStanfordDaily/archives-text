Editor-iu-Chief. Business Manager.
Kntered at Stanford University postoffice
as second class mail matter.
PRINTED AT THE PALO ALTO TIMES OFFICE I

With this issue the editor fin- :
ishes his work on the college press.
The pressure of University work
and the good times of the week j
have deprived him of the assistance
of those whose previous enrollment
on the staff should have made in
terested co-workers in this enter
prise. That he has been at a dis
advantage is manifest in the short-1
comings of this edition,
The generous and effective assist- j
ance of Mr. A. B. Rice, last year's
editor of this paper, and of Mr.
J. R. Griffin, have enabled him to
accomplish what little he has done.
It is with sincere gratitude that he
acknowledges the timely aid. Much
valuable material has been crowded
out on account of the unexpected
length of the commencement ad
dress.
