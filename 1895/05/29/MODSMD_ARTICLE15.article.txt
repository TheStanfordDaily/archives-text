The Department of Justice at
Washington lias very recently as
sured Mrs. Stanford that the Gov
ernment case will be pushed
to an ultimate decision without de
lay. N ) one acquainted with the
legal aspects of the case doubts for
a moment that this decision will be
favorable to the University. There
fore while the future of the Uni
versity, is in a sense dependent
upon the fate of the government
suit, it is none the less safe. In
any event it must not be forgotten
that the work of the coming year
is already provided for, and this
year will undoubtedly see the Uni
versity released from its financial
difficulties.
