# Pinafore.
## 
### 
Trie presentation of Pin .fore in the
gymnasium Monday morning was a
rare treat for those who were fortu
nate enough to be present. The |
llildebrand library fund was mater-i
ially increased and Dr. Goebel is
happy. The laurel, ivy rnd ever
green decorations were piopusely
arranged around the huge gymna
sium, producing a brilliant effect.
The cist was strengthened by the
improvement of Miss llelei Willie,
Josephine, and the more concerned
work of the choruses. The work of
the orchestra was superb. Under the
direction of Connick. '06, one of the
best musical organizations on the
coast has been effected. To his
energy, is almost wholly due
the credit for the entire Pinafore
production.
Misses M iia and C »wjn took their
parts well and received repeated ap
plause. Shirley Bker, as R»lph
Rackstraw, sustained his p.rt well, as
did also Simmons in his role as Dick
Dsadeyc.
Oue of the most pleasing features of
the entertainment was the farcical love
scene of Baker and Field during the
intermission between the first and
second acts.
