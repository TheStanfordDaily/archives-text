# Reception to the Pioneer Class
## 
### 
On Friday evening last, for the first
and for the last time in'their history, the
Pioneer Class met at Koble Hall upon
the invitation of President and Mrs.
Jordan and the members of the faculty.
The professors' wives had tastefully
decorated the halls and parlors with
Spanish moss and an abundance of
cardinal flowers, and other effects
together with the soft, low music by the
orchestra produced an agreeable first
impression which the general entertain
ment of the evening bore out. It was a
quiet unconventional gathering together
of teachers and students, to converse
unhampered by thoughts of class-room
etiquette; to meet more upon a basis of
social freedom and equality than had
been customary between the ringing; of
the electric bells in the quadrangle.
The young ladies of the graduating
class were to have assisted the professors
wives in receiving the men, but except
for the courtesies of the dining room
where light, refreshments were served,
no formal reception seemed necessary.
Including the faculty and their wives
there were over three hundred persons
present, and thev remained throughout
the eveningâ€”a sufficient commentary
upon the nature of the reception.
