# Four Years Retrospective of Stanford University.
## 
### 
vStanford Uuiversitv was born
full-grown. Its four years of life
have been full and turbulent ones.
During the days of darkness that
are now almost over it won its
right to live; it has gained a
strength by surviving through the
last two years that stamps it as
being directed to a noble purpose
by a steadfast will. It is not of
the turbulence but of the fullness ,
of its life that I shall refer to here.
The placid life of the student has
not been ruffled by the threatened
doom of the University; and they
have been able to work out their
destiny as though nothing had
arisen to cast a gloom over its
great promise.
Four years ago the University
was an educational experiment,
the experiment was unique; the
magnificence of its conception was
startling, and the boldness with
which it dispensed with precedent
and marked out its own path, in
dicated that is policy was to be
that of a leader in the educational
world. The fact that the Univer
sity was untried, influenced the
personnel of the entering class,
The first students felt that a risk
was incurred and the price they
were willing to pay for their edu
cation was that they should be the
subjects of the experiment. Many
men entered the first year, who
could not have gained admission
into any other collegiate institu
tion in the country, because of
their mental and moral disqualifi
cations. The latter were most ap
parent, and it was not until stu
dents had been plucked by the
score that the student body took
on a permanent form. The weed
ing process was not a difficult
one, for the junior faculty lived at
Encina through the first year and
often accepted invitations to fresh
men suppers and there exchanged
stories and experiences.
The standard for admission was
low, and such elementary work
was done during the first year.
Not only among the students, how
ever, was the scholarship poor, for
while in one part of the Quad
rangle a class was correcting poor
ly written phrases, and learning
the distinction between "shall and
willy* in another corner of the
Quadrangle an instructor was say
ing, "When the particle A has
been drug along to here" or "Now,
class, see what I have did." Evi
dences of superficiality were not
wanting. Early in the second
year a course was given in Cor
porate Industry, and the instructor
in order to show his erudition,
pointed out how Adam and Eve
were the first co-operators in
clothes-making, and a further illus
tration, he told how the Israelites
hod co-operated in god-making,
when they gave their golden
trinkets to Aaron for calf-making.
It was a very practical type of
man that composed the entering
class; its members were individual

istic, and made of the stuff that
overcomes; had not this been the
case they would nof have entered
an untried college. More conser
vative men would have chosen a
college with an established name
and one that could give prestige to
its graduates. Stanford attracted
self-reliant men from every part of
the country and from many col
leges. The diversity in the tastes
and aims of these men was our
salvation. Their chief character
istic was their adaptability. Had
they been all drawn from one State
their activity would have been
grooved from the beginning. The
cosmopolitan character of the Stan
ford student body will ever make
it improbable that the life here
will be placid and uneventful.

Those first years of assumption.
Merit had had no opportunity to
assert itself and prominence and
position went to those who seized
it. This was true socially, and it
is only within the last year or so
that merit has been rccognized and
assumption detected.
One of the most encouraging
things in those early days was the
spirit of non interference in stu
dents' affairs shown by the faculty.
Sometimes there was a directed su
pervision. but this was accom
plished in a pleasant way because
of the intimacy existing between
faculty and students. The intima
cy at times became an unpleasant
familiarity, which made it possible
fora Freshman to approach Dr.
Jordan after the "Ascent of the
Matterhorn," had been delivered
for the first time, and extend his
hand with the words, "allow
me to congratulate you on the
success of your effort, Doctor."
With the fading of this intimacy
there have not been found wanting
slight indications of a spirit of pa
ternalism toward student affairs*
The fading of the intimacy has
been a good thing for the students,
so also has been the rise of the reg
ulative tendency of the faculty.
It has been claimed many times
that the students are free here be
cause ot the absence of any code of
regulations. There is an unwritten
code, however, which binds the
students and leaves him free to do
only what is willed. There is an
absence of legislation but fiats are
not uncommon. The Stanford
press is aware of this and submits
to the limited censorship existing,
because they recognize that it is
just. All this is as it should be,
but when we boast of our student
freedom these limitations should be
remembered.
Criticism of action from above is.
not infrequent and not always kind.
An extract from a caustic letter

Palo Alto and intended for publica

of censorship, A profes:o' was
