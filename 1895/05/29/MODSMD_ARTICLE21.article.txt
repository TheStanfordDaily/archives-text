# Four Years Retrospective of Stanford University.
## 
### 
vStanford Uuiversitv was born
full-grown. Its four years of life
have been full and turbulent ones.
During the days of darkness that
are now almost over it won its
right to live; it has gained a
strength by surviving through the
last two years that stamps it as
being directed to a noble purpose
by a steadfast will. It is not of
the turbulence but of the fullness ,
of its life that I shall refer to here.
The placid life of the student has
not been ruffled by the threatened
doom of the University; and they
have been able to work out their
destiny as though nothing had
arisen to cast a gloom over its
great promise.
Four years ago the University
was an educational experiment,
the experiment was unique; the
magnificence of its conception was
startling, and the boldness with
which it dispensed with precedent
and marked out its own path, in
dicated that is policy was to be
that of a leader in the educational
world. The fact that the Univer
sity was untried, influenced the
personnel of the entering class,
The first students felt that a risk
was incurred and the price they
were willing to pay for their edu
cation was that they should be the
subjects of the experiment. Many
men entered the first year, who
could not have gained admission
into any other collegiate institu
tion in the country, because of
their mental and moral disqualifi
cations. The latter were most ap
parent, and it was not until stu
dents had been plucked by the
score that the student body took
on a permanent form. The weed
ing process was not a difficult
one, for the junior faculty lived at
Encina through the first year and
often accepted invitations to fresh
men suppers and there exchanged
stories and experiences.
The standard for admission was
low, and such elementary work
was done during the first year.
Not only among the students, how
ever, was the scholarship poor, for
while in one part of the Quad
rangle a class was correcting poor
ly written phrases, and learning
the distinction between "shall and
willy* in another corner of the
Quadrangle an instructor was say
ing, "When the particle A has
been drug along to here" or "Now,
class, see what I have did." Evi
dences of superficiality were not
wanting. Early in the second
year a course was given in Cor
porate Industry, and the instructor
in order to show his erudition,
pointed out how Adam and Eve
were the first co-operators in
clothes-making, and a further illus
tration, he told how the Israelites
hod co-operated in god-making,
when they gave their golden
trinkets to Aaron for calf-making.
It was a very practical type of
man that composed the entering
class; its members were individual

istic, and made of the stuff that
overcomes; had not this been the
case they would nof have entered
an untried college. More conser
vative men would have chosen a
college with an established name
and one that could give prestige to
its graduates. Stanford attracted
self-reliant men from every part of
the country and from many col
leges. The diversity in the tastes
and aims of these men was our
salvation. Their chief character
istic was their adaptability. Had
they been all drawn from one State
their activity would have been
grooved from the beginning. The
cosmopolitan character of the Stan
ford student body will ever make
it improbable that the life here
will be placid and uneventful.

Those first years of assumption.
Merit had had no opportunity to
assert itself and prominence and
position went to those who seized
it. This was true socially, and it
is only within the last year or so
that merit has been rccognized and
assumption detected.
One of the most encouraging
things in those early days was the
spirit of non interference in stu
dents' affairs shown by the faculty.
Sometimes there was a directed su
pervision. but this was accom
plished in a pleasant way because
of the intimacy existing between
faculty and students. The intima
cy at times became an unpleasant
familiarity, which made it possible
fora Freshman to approach Dr.
Jordan after the "Ascent of the
Matterhorn," had been delivered
for the first time, and extend his
hand with the words, "allow
me to congratulate you on the
success of your effort, Doctor."
With the fading of this intimacy
there have not been found wanting
slight indications of a spirit of pa
ternalism toward student affairs*
The fading of the intimacy has
been a good thing for the students,
so also has been the rise of the reg
ulative tendency of the faculty.
It has been claimed many times
that the students are free here be
cause ot the absence of any code of
regulations. There is an unwritten
code, however, which binds the
students and leaves him free to do
only what is willed. There is an
absence of legislation but fiats are
not uncommon. The Stanford
press is aware of this and submits
to the limited censorship existing,
because they recognize that it is
just. All this is as it should be,
but when we boast of our student
freedom these limitations should be
remembered.
Criticism of action from above is.
not infrequent and not always kind.
An extract from a caustic letter
addressed to an editor of the Daily
Palo Alto and intended for publica
tion will indicate a common type
of censorship, A profes:o' was
dissatisfied with the published re
-1 port of his lecture and on the fol
lowing day wrote :
"I wish to express my sympathy
for the stenographer who made an
attempt to take down my lecture
and at the same time offer him an
humble apology for the pain my
English may have caused him."
Then follows a paragraph of
caustic criticism which concludes
with: "The greatest charm of
your verbatim extracts is due to
this: the reporter began to write
before he began to hear."
When in office I received an
average of one such letter weekly
from varions sources, which plainly
showed that student freedom was
subject to scathing criticism and
was limited by a superior will.
The freedom is said to take most
evident form in the elective system,
for the serious work of the Univers
ity this system is a cipher, while
for those who do not know their
goal and have no ambition, it is
very pleasing. It may be true
that a student is capable of choos
ing his courses, but a choice which
must conform to some one goal
must be based on, not what is pleas
ant and desirable, but on a compre
hensive view of the end to be ob
tained. This comprehensive view
of one's goal only conies after sev
eral years of University work, and
if one is allowed to fritter away
the first years in courses that mere
ly please, it is not likely that the
goal is to be reached without much
misdirected energy and misapplied
application. This frequently hap
pens here. An instance will illus
trate this and at the same time will
give an insight into our social life.
At a reception two years ago, a
girl said to me on meeting her:
"How many hours have you? ?"
"Fifteen." "O, I have twenty-one.
I have three hours German, two
afternoons Botany, three after
noons sketching, three hours Hy
giene, ane hour of Astromany, and
then I have two hours in Ethics
with Mr. Griggs, because I do so
like to look at him, and then I
take Evolution because it is so
nice to sit and just listen, and not
have to do anything, and then Mr-
Jordan does say such cute things
sometimes. Now, that is only 3-5-
8-11-12-14-16 hours, isn't it?"
Why; I must have five more. O
yes, I almost forgot my major sub
ject, five hours English, but that
doesn't count, you know, because
I only want to know enough about
literature to be able to talk about
books at afternoon teas.' That
the elective system was of any
value to this young lady is ques
tionable, or that it was more so to
one follow who came up here
three years ago and registered in
mining engineering, because as he
said, "ma wants me to do some
thing clean and nice." and when
he found his chosen profession
inartistic changed to Entomology,
and in his third year dropped into
English for purpose of "culture and
courtship," Fortunately the elec
tive system is unknown in the
technical courses here until the
senior year and then but in a limited
way.
To a stranger, the university life
is uninteresting and uninviting.
The amount of earnest work done
here is the cause of this and at the
same time makes those college
friendships so often refered to, so
rarely seen here, From the be
ginning, only those who had
power to do have been of an y im
portance. The jolly good fellow
lias always been an incumbrance,
The absence of opportunities for
intimacy hascalled many clubs and
organizations into existence based
on place relations. A home in the
same state or a residence on the
same peach-patch is bond enough
as a basis for Stanford friendship.

Many men come here and degen
erate, they find no companionship, '
and the culture they hope to ob
tain when they left the county is
as far beyond them as ever. There
is a segregation into too many cli
ques, and the best men enjoy each i
others society in but a limited way. j
It is unfortunate that fraternities
ever entered Stanford. The in
dividual is lost in an organization
which takes first place in his affec
tions. If one fraternity were the
segregation of the best, all would
be well, but the best men are scat
tered through all the fraternities
and in a half dozen outside cliques,
and their intercourse is limited by
the fact that a rivalry divides
them. The fraternity levels
and produces mediocre men. If
this type of man is the most desir
able Stanford student life will pro
duce it. If a college should cater
for the best men and improve them,
then the best must be segregated
and not divided. Now that frater
nities are here the only hope lies
in the encouragement of the inter
fraternitv unity. Those outside
of fraternities have more opportun
ity for varied and extensive com
panionships than do the members
of these secret societies. The seg
regation of the student body into
cliques has been induced by imi
tation of the fraternity life and the
tendency to stratify among the
men has been fostered by the pres
ence of coteries among woman.
It has been said that much of
the lack of intimacy among the
men is chargeable to co-education
and the cause is attributed to the
fact that the men spend their
hours of idleness at Roble, and
have no leisure for their associates.
This may be true in a limited sense
and a few men may indulge in
Quadrangle courtships, because of
the absense of any curtained win
dow seat, but the co-education
j here, more so than any other col
leges, has done much to promote
! harmony and good fellowship.
| One thing that may be noticed
; here is the increasing percentage
| of women attending the Univer
sity. For every hundred men
there were thirty-three women the
| first year; during the second it run
to forty-two; last year the number
was fourty-four and this year there
are fifty-one women for ever}' hun
dred men. This is a startling in
| crease and may be due to the fact
j that women are attending college
in rapidly increasing numbers, but
I the most logical assumption is that
I Stanford is better suited for ladies
' than other colleges since they do
not show so rapid an increase in
lady attendance. This would
seem to point to the possibility
that within twenty years Stanford
may become the Yassar of the Pa
cific Coast, in which event it is
trusted that an opportunity may be
afforded tocoeducate men here.
One very startling phase of stu
dent life has been presented from
the beginning—Scholarship is
despised, and Mother Grundy's
most effective sarcasm is to call a
man a dig. Proficiency in studies
is synonymous with crankiness and
social unfitness, To be a skilful
quadrangle dawdler is an essential
qualification for social success.
There is no goal in the student's
life in college nor is there honor
for industry or reward for excell
ence. This is often discouraging,
because few students have so com
prehensive a view of life, or so
well defined ambitions as to be able
to work on aud on towards some
very distant goal. They need some
criterion of their progress, they are
not sufficiently self confident to be

satisfied wtli their own judgment of I
their efforts, Were it possible to
afford some recognition fora sue-;
cessful career as a student, which
would be at the same time an in-,
centive to effort and a reward for
achievement, this low estimate of
scholarship would disappear. It
may be true that it is better for
men to work on in college with an
ambition not limited by the scholar
ship of the class room, but it is also
true that the rewards of scholar
ship should \>2 as enticing and as
gratifying as those of the oval and
the diamond. For those who can
successfully live at Stanford for
four years there is every hope.
The surroundings have been vig
orous and inspiring from the very
beginning. The men here have
no shallow notions of the things
required of them in life, and the
power in the initiative has been
bred in them during four years of
precedent making, is sure to carry
them to the front of active life.
Stanford's tone is worldly; ideal
ism is dead; expedients displace
principle, and the men she turns
out will be self contained and self
centered, with secular anbitions
and with power to attain them.
Fanciful notions of what ought to
be do not trouble us; and in few
colleges of the country, perhaps,
are there so few vain dreamers as
at Stanford. There is little fear
j that any one with a Stanford train
; ing will ever say, as did a graduate
! of the University of California and
| who also played with the '93 foot
ball team, that things were not so
bad in San Francisco as he had
anticipated, and that he found a
! college man could get a position as
' easily at one thing as at another;"
"for his own part," he said, "he
found no difficulty in getting a job
at six bits a day skimming sugar."
The amount of talent which has
been shown by the student body
1 during the last four years has been
a matter of no small surprise and
[gratification to many of the senior
faculty. It teems with resources,
its ideas are worlkable, and its
'judgmensare mature. The iium
i ber of things which have been un
-1 dertaken and carrie out success
-1 fully show a diversity of ability
j that is prophetic of lives of influ
• ence and prominence. There are
a great number of mediocre men
here, who will ever be subordi
nates, but those who have gained
most of the Stanford spirit of self
reliance, and caught inspiration
from a sympathetic faculty, will
stand to'the fore wherever they
may be found. One of the hap
piest influences I know at Stan
ford, is found in contact with such
men as the head of our history de
partment; his inspiration of young
men is an enduring one and the
rememberance of his earnestness
and manhood will be the most per
manent memory which many '95
men will carry with them into the
future. There are not wanting
j those, too, whose ambitions are
| far beyond their ability, and who
are doing nothing here but open
ing avenues of disappointment
; thoughout their life; and it is a
care for the welfare for such men
in college that reduces the high
standard of excellence possible to
I the best.
The University is no longer an
experiment; in another month a
hundred men will prove this fact
in a hundred homes. That the
class of '95 has stood by the col
lege of their first choice during its
stormy life, is evidence of their
j faith in its future. The days of
disquietude are well-nigh over; the
future is bright, and the past has

been a glorious one; it is a record
of achievement and an instance of
what devotion to a trust may do.
\\ hat the outgowi ng class may do
for Stanford's future, is to show
to the world that the work done
here is a noble one, and that May
14th, 18S7, was an epoch-making
day in the educational history of
our country. To have belonged to
the class which is about to leave
is to me the greatest honor. I feel
that to have been present at the
inception of so noble a cause, to
have had the opportunity of being
thrilled by its first four years of
stormy lite, will be one of my
clieiished memories; and I ask
for no other future than that it
shall be governed by the intluencss
which nave controlled me here.
Our life here as students has
been richer in the incidents that
will always refresh us with their
memory than ever it will be again.
For years of life have been hal
lowed to us by these "stately,
splendid, simple walls of stone."
In the years to come no glimpses
into the past will be fraught
with sweeter thoughts, than those
which recall the noble purpose
of the man of generous heart,
now shrouded by the days of
darkness that knows no dawn;
and the place of honor in our
recollections will always belong to
her whose devotion and self-sacra
fice, have so nobly conserved the
trust, consecrated by her care, and
to whom a tribute of gratitude and
love can take 110 other form, than
a lite worthy of the high example
she has set us.

Fanciful notions of what ought to
be do not trouble us; and in few
colleges of the country, perhaps,
are there so few vain dreamers as
at Stanford. There is little fear
j that any one with a Stanford train
; ing will ever say, as did a graduate
! of the University of California and
| who also played with the '93 foot
ball team, that things were not so
bad in San Francisco as he had
anticipated, and that he found a
! college man could get a position as
' easily at one thing as at another;"
"for his own part," he said, "he
found no difficulty in getting a job
at six bits a day skimming sugar."
The amount of talent which has
been shown by the student body
1 during the last four years has been
a matter of no small surprise and
[gratification to many of the senior
faculty. It teems with resources,
its ideas are worlkable, and its
'judgmensare mature. The iium
i ber of things which have been un
-1 dertaken and carrie out success
-1 fully show a diversity of ability
j that is prophetic of lives of influ
• ence and prominence. There are
a great number of mediocre men
here, who will ever be subordi
nates, but those who have gained
most of the Stanford spirit of self
reliance, and caught inspiration
from a sympathetic faculty, will
stand to'the fore wherever they
may be found. One of the hap
piest influences I know at Stan
ford, is found in contact with such
men as the head of our history de
partment; his inspiration of young
men is an enduring one and the
rememberance of his earnestness
and manhood will be the most per
manent memory which many '95
men will carry with them into the
future. There are not wanting
j those, too, whose ambitions are
| far beyond their ability, and who
are doing nothing here but open
ing avenues of disappointment
; thoughout their life; and it is a
care for the welfare for such men
in college that reduces the high
standard of excellence possible to
I the best.
The University is no longer an
experiment; in another month a
hundred men will prove this fact
in a hundred homes. That the
class of '95 has stood by the col
lege of their first choice during its
stormy life, is evidence of their
j faith in its future. The days of
disquietude are well-nigh over; the
future is bright, and the past has

been a glorious one; it is a record
of achievement and an instance of
what devotion to a trust may do.
\\ hat the outgowi ng class may do
for Stanford's future, is to show
to the world that the work done
here is a noble one, and that May
14th, 18S7, was an epoch-making
day in the educational history of
our country. To have belonged to
the class which is about to leave
is to me the greatest honor. I feel
that to have been present at the
inception of so noble a cause, to
have had the opportunity of being
thrilled by its first four years of
stormy lite, will be one of my
clieiished memories; and I ask
for no other future than that it
shall be governed by the intluencss
which nave controlled me here.
Our life here as students has
been richer in the incidents that
will always refresh us with their
memory than ever it will be again.
For years of life have been hal
lowed to us by these "stately,
splendid, simple walls of stone."
In the years to come no glimpses
into the past will be fraught
with sweeter thoughts, than those
which recall the noble purpose
of the man of generous heart,
now shrouded by the days of
darkness that knows no dawn;
and the place of honor in our
recollections will always belong to
her whose devotion and self-sacra
fice, have so nobly conserved the
trust, consecrated by her care, and
to whom a tribute of gratitude and
love can take 110 other form, than
a lite worthy of the high example
she has set us.
vStanford Uuiversitv was born
full-grown. Its four years of life
have been full and turbulent ones.
During the days of darkness that
are now almost over it won its
right to live; it has gained a
strength by surviving through the
last two years that stamps it as
being directed to a noble purpose
by a steadfast will. It is not of
the turbulence but of the fullness ,
of its life that I shall refer to here.
The placid life of the student has
not been ruffled by the threatened
doom of the University; and they
have been able to work out their
destiny as though nothing had
arisen to cast a gloom over its
great promise.
Four years ago the University
was an educational experiment,
the experiment was unique; the
magnificence of its conception was
startling, and the boldness with
which it dispensed with precedent
and marked out its own path, in
dicated that is policy was to be
that of a leader in the educational
world. The fact that the Univer
sity was untried, influenced the
personnel of the entering class,
The first students felt that a risk
was incurred and the price they
were willing to pay for their edu
cation was that they should be the
subjects of the experiment. Many
men entered the first year, who
could not have gained admission
into any other collegiate institu
tion in the country, because of
their mental and moral disqualifi
cations. The latter were most ap
parent, and it was not until stu
dents had been plucked by the
score that the student body took
on a permanent form. The weed
ing process was not a difficult
one, for the junior faculty lived at
Encina through the first year and
often accepted invitations to fresh
men suppers and there exchanged
stories and experiences.
The standard for admission was
low, and such elementary work
was done during the first year.
Not only among the students, how
ever, was the scholarship poor, for
while in one part of the Quad
rangle a class was correcting poor
ly written phrases, and learning
the distinction between "shall and
willy* in another corner of the
Quadrangle an instructor was say
ing, "When the particle A has
been drug along to here" or "Now,
class, see what I have did." Evi
dences of superficiality were not
wanting. Early in the second
year a course was given in Cor
porate Industry, and the instructor
in order to show his erudition,
pointed out how Adam and Eve
were the first co-operators in
clothes-making, and a further illus
tration, he told how the Israelites
hod co-operated in god-making,
when they gave their golden
trinkets to Aaron for calf-making.
It was a very practical type of
man that composed the entering
class; its members were individual

istic, and made of the stuff that
overcomes; had not this been the
case they would nof have entered
an untried college. More conser
vative men would have chosen a
college with an established name
and one that could give prestige to
its graduates. Stanford attracted
self-reliant men from every part of
the country and from many col
leges. The diversity in the tastes
and aims of these men was our
salvation. Their chief character
istic was their adaptability. Had
they been all drawn from one State
their activity would have been
grooved from the beginning. The
cosmopolitan character of the Stan
ford student body will ever make
it improbable that the life here
will be placid and uneventful.

Those first years of assumption.
Merit had had no opportunity to
assert itself and prominence and
position went to those who seized
it. This was true socially, and it
is only within the last year or so
that merit has been rccognized and
assumption detected.
One of the most encouraging
things in those early days was the
spirit of non interference in stu
dents' affairs shown by the faculty.
Sometimes there was a directed su
pervision. but this was accom
plished in a pleasant way because
of the intimacy existing between
faculty and students. The intima
cy at times became an unpleasant
familiarity, which made it possible
fora Freshman to approach Dr.
Jordan after the "Ascent of the
Matterhorn," had been delivered
for the first time, and extend his
hand with the words, "allow
me to congratulate you on the
success of your effort, Doctor."
With the fading of this intimacy
there have not been found wanting
slight indications of a spirit of pa
ternalism toward student affairs*
The fading of the intimacy has
been a good thing for the students,
so also has been the rise of the reg
ulative tendency of the faculty.
It has been claimed many times
that the students are free here be
cause ot the absence of any code of
regulations. There is an unwritten
code, however, which binds the
students and leaves him free to do
only what is willed. There is an
absence of legislation but fiats are
not uncommon. The Stanford
press is aware of this and submits
to the limited censorship existing,
because they recognize that it is
just. All this is as it should be,
but when we boast of our student
freedom these limitations should be
remembered.
Criticism of action from above is.
not infrequent and not always kind.
An extract from a caustic letter
addressed to an editor of the Daily
Palo Alto and intended for publica
tion will indicate a common type
of censorship, A profes:o' was
dissatisfied with the published re
-1 port of his lecture and on the fol
lowing day wrote :
"I wish to express my sympathy
for the stenographer who made an
attempt to take down my lecture
and at the same time offer him an
humble apology for the pain my
English may have caused him."
Then follows a paragraph of
caustic criticism which concludes
with: "The greatest charm of
your verbatim extracts is due to
this: the reporter began to write
before he began to hear."
When in office I received an
average of one such letter weekly
from varions sources, which plainly
showed that student freedom was
subject to scathing criticism and
was limited by a superior will.
The freedom is said to take most
evident form in the elective system,
for the serious work of the Univers
ity this system is a cipher, while
for those who do not know their
goal and have no ambition, it is
very pleasing. It may be true
that a student is capable of choos
ing his courses, but a choice which
must conform to some one goal
must be based on, not what is pleas
ant and desirable, but on a compre
hensive view of the end to be ob
tained. This comprehensive view
of one's goal only conies after sev
eral years of University work, and
if one is allowed to fritter away
the first years in courses that mere
ly please, it is not likely that the
goal is to be reached without much
misdirected energy and misapplied
application. This frequently hap
pens here. An instance will illus
trate this and at the same time will
give an insight into our social life.
At a reception two years ago, a
girl said to me on meeting her:
"How many hours have you? ?"
"Fifteen." "O, I have twenty-one.
I have three hours German, two
afternoons Botany, three after
noons sketching, three hours Hy
giene, ane hour of Astromany, and
then I have two hours in Ethics
with Mr. Griggs, because I do so
like to look at him, and then I
take Evolution because it is so
nice to sit and just listen, and not
have to do anything, and then Mr-
Jordan does say such cute things
sometimes. Now, that is only 3-5-
8-11-12-14-16 hours, isn't it?"
Why; I must have five more. O
yes, I almost forgot my major sub
ject, five hours English, but that
doesn't count, you know, because
I only want to know enough about
literature to be able to talk about
books at afternoon teas.' That
the elective system was of any
value to this young lady is ques
tionable, or that it was more so to
one follow who came up here
three years ago and registered in
mining engineering, because as he
said, "ma wants me to do some
thing clean and nice." and when
he found his chosen profession
inartistic changed to Entomology,
and in his third year dropped into
English for purpose of "culture and
courtship," Fortunately the elec
tive system is unknown in the
technical courses here until the
senior year and then but in a limited
way.
To a stranger, the university life
is uninteresting and uninviting.
The amount of earnest work done
here is the cause of this and at the
same time makes those college
friendships so often refered to, so
rarely seen here, From the be
ginning, only those who had
power to do have been of an y im
portance. The jolly good fellow
lias always been an incumbrance,
The absence of opportunities for
intimacy hascalled many clubs and
organizations into existence based
on place relations. A home in the
same state or a residence on the
same peach-patch is bond enough
as a basis for Stanford friendship.

Many men come here and degen
erate, they find no companionship, '
and the culture they hope to ob
tain when they left the county is
as far beyond them as ever. There
is a segregation into too many cli
ques, and the best men enjoy each i
others society in but a limited way. j
It is unfortunate that fraternities
ever entered Stanford. The in
dividual is lost in an organization
which takes first place in his affec
tions. If one fraternity were the
segregation of the best, all would
be well, but the best men are scat
tered through all the fraternities
and in a half dozen outside cliques,
and their intercourse is limited by
the fact that a rivalry divides
them. The fraternity levels
and produces mediocre men. If
this type of man is the most desir
able Stanford student life will pro
duce it. If a college should cater
for the best men and improve them,
then the best must be segregated
and not divided. Now that frater
nities are here the only hope lies
in the encouragement of the inter
fraternitv unity. Those outside
of fraternities have more opportun
ity for varied and extensive com
panionships than do the members
of these secret societies. The seg
regation of the student body into
cliques has been induced by imi
tation of the fraternity life and the
tendency to stratify among the
men has been fostered by the pres
ence of coteries among woman.
It has been said that much of
the lack of intimacy among the
men is chargeable to co-education
and the cause is attributed to the
fact that the men spend their
hours of idleness at Roble, and
have no leisure for their associates.
This may be true in a limited sense
and a few men may indulge in
Quadrangle courtships, because of
the absense of any curtained win
dow seat, but the co-education
j here, more so than any other col
leges, has done much to promote
! harmony and good fellowship.
| One thing that may be noticed
; here is the increasing percentage
| of women attending the Univer
sity. For every hundred men
there were thirty-three women the
| first year; during the second it run
to forty-two; last year the number
was fourty-four and this year there
are fifty-one women for ever}' hun
dred men. This is a startling in
| crease and may be due to the fact
j that women are attending college
in rapidly increasing numbers, but
I the most logical assumption is that
I Stanford is better suited for ladies
' than other colleges since they do
not show so rapid an increase in
lady attendance. This would
seem to point to the possibility
that within twenty years Stanford
may become the Yassar of the Pa
cific Coast, in which event it is
trusted that an opportunity may be
afforded tocoeducate men here.
One very startling phase of stu
dent life has been presented from
the beginning—Scholarship is
despised, and Mother Grundy's
most effective sarcasm is to call a
man a dig. Proficiency in studies
is synonymous with crankiness and
social unfitness, To be a skilful
quadrangle dawdler is an essential
qualification for social success.
There is no goal in the student's
life in college nor is there honor
for industry or reward for excell
ence. This is often discouraging,
because few students have so com
prehensive a view of life, or so
well defined ambitions as to be able
to work on aud on towards some
very distant goal. They need some
criterion of their progress, they are
not sufficiently self confident to be

satisfied wtli their own judgment of I
their efforts, Were it possible to
afford some recognition fora sue-;
cessful career as a student, which
would be at the same time an in-,
centive to effort and a reward for
achievement, this low estimate of
scholarship would disappear. It
may be true that it is better for
men to work on in college with an
ambition not limited by the scholar
ship of the class room, but it is also
true that the rewards of scholar
ship should \>2 as enticing and as
gratifying as those of the oval and
the diamond. For those who can
successfully live at Stanford for
four years there is every hope.
The surroundings have been vig
orous and inspiring from the very
beginning. The men here have
no shallow notions of the things
required of them in life, and the
power in the initiative has been
bred in them during four years of
precedent making, is sure to carry
them to the front of active life.
Stanford's tone is worldly; ideal
ism is dead; expedients displace
principle, and the men she turns
out will be self contained and self
centered, with secular anbitions
and with power to attain them.
Fanciful notions of what ought to
be do not trouble us; and in few
colleges of the country, perhaps,
are there so few vain dreamers as
at Stanford. There is little fear
j that any one with a Stanford train
; ing will ever say, as did a graduate
! of the University of California and

ball team, that things were not so
bad in San Francisco as he had
anticipated, and that he found a
! college man could get a position as
' easily at one thing as at another;"
"for his own part," he said, "he
found no difficulty in getting a job
at six bits a day skimming sugar."
The amount of talent which has
been shown by the student body
1 during the last four years has been
a matter of no small surprise and
[gratification to many of the senior
faculty. It teems with resources,
its ideas are worlkable, and its
'judgmensare mature. The iium

-1 dertaken and carrie out success

and their intercourse is limited by
the fact that a rivalry divides
them. The fraternity levels
and produces mediocre men. If
this type of man is the most desir
able Stanford student life will pro
duce it. If a college should cater
for the best men and improve them,
then the best must be segregated
and not divided. Now that frater
nities are here the only hope lies
in the encouragement of the inter
fraternitv unity. Those outside
of fraternities have more opportun
ity for varied and extensive com
panionships than do the members
of these secret societies. The seg
regation of the student body into
cliques has been induced by imi
tation of the fraternity life and the
tendency to stratify among the
men has been fostered by the pres
ence of coteries among woman.
It has been said that much of
the lack of intimacy among the
men is chargeable to co-education
and the cause is attributed to the
fact that the men spend their
hours of idleness at Roble, and
have no leisure for their associates.
This may be true in a limited sense
and a few men may indulge in
Quadrangle courtships, because of
the absense of any curtained win
dow seat, but the co-education
j here, more so than any other col
leges, has done much to promote
! harmony and good fellowship.
| One thing that may be noticed
; here is the increasing percentage
| of women attending the Univer
sity. For every hundred men
there were thirty-three women the
| first year; during the second it run
to forty-two; last year the number
was fourty-four and this year there
are fifty-one women for ever}' hun
dred men. This is a startling in
| crease and may be due to the fact
j that women are attending college
in rapidly increasing numbers, but
I the most logical assumption is that
I Stanford is better suited for ladies
' than other colleges since they do
not show so rapid an increase in
lady attendance. This would
seem to point to the possibility
that within twenty years Stanford
may become the Yassar of the Pa
cific Coast, in which event it is
trusted that an opportunity may be
afforded tocoeducate men here.
One very startling phase of stu
dent life has been presented from
the beginning—Scholarship is
despised, and Mother Grundy's
most effective sarcasm is to call a
man a dig. Proficiency in studies
is synonymous with crankiness and
social unfitness, To be a skilful
quadrangle dawdler is an essential
qualification for social success.
There is no goal in the student's
life in college nor is there honor
for industry or reward for excell
ence. This is often discouraging,
because few students have so com
prehensive a view of life, or so
well defined ambitions as to be able
to work on aud on towards some
very distant goal. They need some
criterion of their progress, they are
not sufficiently self confident to be

satisfied wtli their own judgment of I
their efforts, Were it possible to
afford some recognition fora sue-;
cessful career as a student, which
would be at the same time an in-,
centive to effort and a reward for
achievement, this low estimate of
scholarship would disappear. It
may be true that it is better for
men to work on in college with an
ambition not limited by the scholar
ship of the class room, but it is also
true that the rewards of scholar
ship should \>2 as enticing and as
gratifying as those of the oval and
the diamond. For those who can
successfully live at Stanford for
four years there is every hope.
The surroundings have been vig
orous and inspiring from the very
beginning. The men here have
no shallow notions of the things
required of them in life, and the
power in the initiative has been
bred in them during four years of
precedent making, is sure to carry
them to the front of active life.
Stanford's tone is worldly; ideal
ism is dead; expedients displace
principle, and the men she turns
out will be self contained and self
centered, with secular anbitions
and with power to attain them.
Fanciful notions of what ought to
be do not trouble us; and in few
colleges of the country, perhaps,
are there so few vain dreamers as
at Stanford. There is little fear
j that any one with a Stanford train
; ing will ever say, as did a graduate
! of the University of California and
| who also played with the '93 foot
ball team, that things were not so
bad in San Francisco as he had
anticipated, and that he found a
! college man could get a position as
' easily at one thing as at another;"
"for his own part," he said, "he
found no difficulty in getting a job
at six bits a day skimming sugar."
The amount of talent which has
been shown by the student body
1 during the last four years has been
a matter of no small surprise and
[gratification to many of the senior
faculty. It teems with resources,
its ideas are worlkable, and its
'judgmensare mature. The iium
i ber of things which have been un
-1 dertaken and carrie out success
-1 fully show a diversity of ability
j that is prophetic of lives of influ
• ence and prominence. There are
a great number of mediocre men
here, who will ever be subordi
nates, but those who have gained
most of the Stanford spirit of self
reliance, and caught inspiration
from a sympathetic faculty, will
stand to'the fore wherever they
may be found. One of the hap
piest influences I know at Stan
ford, is found in contact with such
men as the head of our history de
partment; his inspiration of young
men is an enduring one and the
rememberance of his earnestness
and manhood will be the most per
manent memory which many '95
men will carry with them into the
future. There are not wanting
j those, too, whose ambitions are
| far beyond their ability, and who
are doing nothing here but open
ing avenues of disappointment
; thoughout their life; and it is a
care for the welfare for such men
in college that reduces the high
standard of excellence possible to
I the best.
The University is no longer an
experiment; in another month a
hundred men will prove this fact
in a hundred homes. That the
class of '95 has stood by the col
lege of their first choice during its
stormy life, is evidence of their
j faith in its future. The days of
disquietude are well-nigh over; the
future is bright, and the past has

been a glorious one; it is a record
of achievement and an instance of
what devotion to a trust may do.
\\ hat the outgowi ng class may do
for Stanford's future, is to show
to the world that the work done
here is a noble one, and that May
14th, 18S7, was an epoch-making
day in the educational history of
our country. To have belonged to
the class which is about to leave
is to me the greatest honor. I feel
that to have been present at the
inception of so noble a cause, to
have had the opportunity of being
thrilled by its first four years of
stormy lite, will be one of my
clieiished memories; and I ask
for no other future than that it
shall be governed by the intluencss
which nave controlled me here.
Our life here as students has
been richer in the incidents that
will always refresh us with their
memory than ever it will be again.
For years of life have been hal
lowed to us by these "stately,
splendid, simple walls of stone."
In the years to come no glimpses
into the past will be fraught
with sweeter thoughts, than those
which recall the noble purpose
of the man of generous heart,
now shrouded by the days of
darkness that knows no dawn;
and the place of honor in our
recollections will always belong to
her whose devotion and self-sacra
fice, have so nobly conserved the
trust, consecrated by her care, and
to whom a tribute of gratitude and
love can take 110 other form, than
a lite worthy of the high example
she has set us.
