# THE 						PIONEERS AT BASEBALL.
## The 						Faculty Beaten by a Senior Team at Last. 
### 
For the first time the faculty has
suffered defeat at the hands of a
senior baseball team. Hitherto in
vincible 0:1 the diamond as in the
lecture room, the intellectual prodi
gies take their defeat to heart, and
woe-betide the '96 sun-spots if the
present outlook is any indication
of what the faculty team will do on
a similar occasion next year. The
faculty ascribe their defeat to the
absence of Professor Sanderson
and Dr. Howard from their list.
The pioneers were attired in
unique costumes which added
greatly to the game, in spectacu
lar, at least. The senior team be
ing composed almost entirely of
varsity players,played rotary posi
tions, each covering a different po
sition in each successive inning.
The composition of the two
teams were : Faculty, Drs. Jor
dan, ib.; Richardson, c ; Angell,
2b; and Wood, 3b; Professors Fish,
p; Kellogg, 1f; Young, rf; Mur
ray, r 112; and Stearns, s s.
Pioneers; Sheehan, Lewis, Rea,
Calhoun, White, Harrelson, Rus
sel, Downing and Baker.
