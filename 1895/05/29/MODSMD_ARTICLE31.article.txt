Prof, and Mrs. Smith will leave
this week for Santa Barbara on
wheels.

Why is there such absence of
the sense of humor in young people
of today? Especially in Universi
ties is youthful gravity most ap
parent. The youth of cities try to
"have fun" and succeed, but college
boys develop a morbid conscien
tiousness that causes them to look
upon everything not strictly allied
to their studies, or not directly
bearing upon "culture" and "high
est development" as frivolous.
University study engenders
thoughtfulness, often pessimism;
yet it should not preclude legiti
mate pleasure, and pure enjoy
ment of the fulness of youth and
life. Why should young men and
woman in Universities any more
than those outside feel that for
four years life is so "real and earn
est" that they must begrudge ev
ery moment of natural joy and
avoid such, as temptation? Even
in our commencement festivities,
there is a calm, a dignified hush, a
self restraint, as though we feared
to give ourselves too much latitude.
We have little of the mischief of
our grand-fathers; we discourse
on the psychology of human affec
tion, while they stole a kiss under
the mistletoe. Luella forgets her
pretty coquetry, [listening to Reg
inald's learned remarks on "The
Relative Status of Wage Earners
on the Pacific and Atlantic Sea-
Boards." Perhaps it is better for
the intellectual progress of the
world that we are what we are, but
we should not scorn the vivacious
and witty side of life, for humor is
the mighty salvation of the weary
and the disconsolate. If your col
lege friend is swamped in the mire
of "concrete human life." advise
Robert Burdette or Jerome K. Jer
ome, that he may forget his sor
rows.
