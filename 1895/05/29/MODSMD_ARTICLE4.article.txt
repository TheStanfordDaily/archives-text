### 
It is fitting that the historical
number of the Palo Ai.to should
contain some account of the result
of the new methods upon second
ary education. In the organization
of the University, I)r. Jordan and
his associates made a radical change
from the usual plan of entrance re
quirements and the usual method
of University work. Those who
wished to enter the new University
as quickly as was consistent with
an adequate preparation, found
that the work done in most second
ary schools was not well adapted
to their needs. The demand fora
special preparatory school grew
stronger each day, and with the
third year of the University began
the attempt to meet this demand.
It was obvious that a flexible
course of study was an essential
requisite, and the school has ac
cordingly made special efforts to
meet individual needs. It has come
about from this cause that each
year there are enrolled some who
are striving to make good partic
ular deficiencies, the results fre
quently of a weak spot in the
school that has given them their
training. It is, however, the spe
cial mission of Manzanita Hall to
send students to their University
work with an unusually thorough
and adequate preparation, and this
end will be best attained in the
case of those who owe to the school
, their entire academic training.
The success of the new school
has been due partly to the princi
ple upon which teachers are se
lected and partly to the nature of
the course of study. The work in
each subject is in the hands of a
specialist who is pursuing ad
vanced researches in his chosen
field of work and is in close contact
with the University department.
No work is undertaken that is not
carried to a definite conclusion,
that conclusion being naturally ad
vanced work in the University
along the same lines. All courses
run throughout the year, and a full
hour is given to recitations, while
students in scientific courses are
required to spend two houss each
day in the laboratory under con
stant supervision. All work de
mands thoroughness and applica
tion, and pupils are allowed to car
ry but a limited numberof subjects.
The growth of Manzanita Hall
lias already made necessary a
change of location. A block in
Alba Park, on the outskirts of Palo
Alto, has been secured as a perma
nent site, and there are already in
process of construction two build
ings that are to form the nucleus of
the new school.
The school already draws pat
ronage from a wide field ; and
since its aim is to serve as a feeder
to the University, and its courses
are arranged and its teachers
selected with this end in view, the
circle of its influence will doubt
less in a measure follow that of the
University itself.
