# Class Will and Testament.
## 
### 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
The following brief document was re
ceived by the reader on the 10:30 mail
this morning [per Mr. Soper and Uncle
Sam J with a request that it should be
read by him at the class exercises under
the'9s oak this afternoon. It was en
veloped in the usual legal parchment
and was accompanied by the necessary
affidavits, etc. It was further requested
by the sender, the class week commit
tee, now an existing body in the eyes of
the law but which by the bye will be
where the stars alone can tell, when the
class creditors put in an appearance on
Wednesday morning; that it be framed
and hung in the new law library with
all due solemnity.
From the general style of said docu
ment. and the peculiar couching of some
of its terms, the composer or composers
were evidently permeated with the
essence of the knowledge usually ob
tained in courses under Professors
Woodruff and Abbott, and in Roman
law upder Dr. Howard. There is an ab
sence of technical Latin terms, showing
i a deficiency on the part of the writer ivj

that live subject. The will reads as fol
lows :
Last will and testament of the class of
96. Preamble: Know all men (and
woman, this being a co-educational in
stitution), by these presents, that we,
the class of '95, of Stanford University,
being of sound and disposing mind and
memory, but knowing the uncertainty
of this life (as of passing in Eng. hi;,
do hereby make, publish and declare
this to be our last will and testament,
hereby revoking,annullingand declaring
void all former wills and testaments by
us at anytime heretofore made.
General items.—After the payment of
our just debts, and funeral charges, and
diploma fees, and board bills, and livery
bills, and laundry bills, and sundry
other bills, in the shape of Big and Lit
tle Bills, and general expenses of ad
ministration, we give, bequeath and de
vise the following property, concrete,
real, abstract and personal, just as you
may take it:
1. We devise the cement walk be
tween Roble ami this gracious tree to
the memory of those Pioneers who have
trodden the extent as effectually as their
forefathers trod the plains in '49, name
ly: Simmons, Rice, Hollister, McDan
iels and Fraser, and of course Pol luck
and his dickey.
2. As landmarks never to be removed,
the Quadrangle, Zion, Means, Adderson
and Architect Hodges.
3. The clock of the late Mr. Kenne
dy, to be placed in the beautiful chimes
building, which stands in college Myth
ology anywhere between the Museum
and the Quad. We respectfully suggest
that an appropriate inscription by the
college poet, Mr, Escholtzia Marigold
Mignonette Hulme, be placed under its
unwilling hands.
4. As an encouragement to under
classmen of small stature, the memory
of the gigantic work in the engineering
line' such as bridge building, sewer
building, railroad constructing, etc., In
such diminutions as these sturdy
Liliputians, O'Brien Woolrich, Harrel
son.
5. A work so valuable that the deepest
archives in the museum should be its
fitting resting place. The well known
treatise on the velositvof large bodies by
W. C. Hazzard.
6. To the faculty—august body—we
leave all our flunks and conditions
to do with them what they will. Should
they wish to destroy, which would be
kind, we humbly advise cremation, not
burial, for as certain as history repeats
itself it will rise like Banquo's ghost
to all the square meals of Encina and
Roble in an unjust disturbance of under
graduate dreams.
7. The traditions of Encina we leave
to classes upon (lasses to come—to
multiply and become manifold in the
eyee of the faculty. Let the memory of
Charles Adams' first Freshman residen
tal soda pop blowout in Mayfield which
caused such a stir in Freshman and
faculty circles go hand in hand down the
annals of hall tradition with that of the
raid by the members of the Wranglers
and Sitters Club upon the champagne
and general good cheer stored under the
watchful eye of our friend the chief
steward of the plenteous larder of our
Ex-Presidential friend and professor,
the descendant of his grandfathers bat.
9. Now that our demise is at hand
we will to other classes from necessity
(but with due modesty) the class base
ball and footfall championships, most
of the offices in the students body and on
college publications, our ruling passion
of undergraduate enthusiasm and last
but not least the dearest place we believe
in the heart of fair Roble.
Clause.—(ln tororem.)(Editors note.)
This being a Pioneer California will,
therefore if Fair at all it was deemed
necessary to insert a clause regarding
contests.
(To continue) We now expre-sly de

elare and provide that if any one or
more of the legatees under this will,
even Zion, shall at any time commence
any proceedings to contest this will, the
legacy devise and provision therein he
guested, devised and provided for shall
from that time become void,and further
more, we , hereby state that awful ca
lamity will befall this community. The
class president will call thedeparted soul
from the superhuman atmosphere Jof
business and domestic life, clothe them
again in college garb, let loose the dogs
oi class war, give revenge no bridle to
influence the faculty to make 40 hours
of English a university requirement.
Abolish .Evolution and hygien, taboo
Ruble from the social sphere,and gather
his forces up over the Museum, wrench
old Plato, Plutarch. Herodotus and
Arstotle, from their erstwhile places on
high, charge them with of the life and
enthusism of '95 and vengeance be on
you, play them on the Berkeley football
team.
We hereby nominate and appoint
Bracchi, the Driver, Billie Hill and Red
of Menlo to be executors of this our last
will and testiment. Let their fees be as
light as their bare extartion.
Signed, sealed and delivered before,
Judge Wigle, this 20th day of May 1895
at 1 o'clock in the mori ing, place un
known.
Class of '95, Testor.
Witness:
Architect Hodges, Patsy Green
Pollock Ed, Ilea.
REQUESTS.
The class requests that its grave be
kept green except around Thanksgiving
Day when we desire a deep cardinal
trimming. 2. —Our second request is
that it be dressed by fate, that in a dis
tant day some razzle dazzle verdant
I-reshmen whose untutored mind|has
grasped through fleeting tradition
the following verse of '91, give it in
memory of other days.
First in scrapes
And of good cheer,
Stanford grapes
And the Maytield Beer,
'95 - '95 - Pioneer.
