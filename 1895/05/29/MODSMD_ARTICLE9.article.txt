# Last Game of the Series
## 
### 
On Saturday, May 18, the last game of j
the Varsity series took place on the
home diamond. The result was an j
overwhelming defeat for the Reliance
Club's aggregation of third rate sand
lotters and a rather poor winding up of
the '95 season on the part of the Stan
ford team. The interest of the specta
tors lagged as soon as one Reliance man
crossed the plate destroying all chances
fora shut-out.
