# THE 						GOVERNMENT SUIT.
## An Abstract of the Masterly Decision of Judge Ross. 
### 
The Central Pacific Railroad
Company of California was in
corporated June 28, 1861, and
prior to the passage of any of the
Pacific Bail road acts by Congress.
The leading spirits of the corpora
tion were Leland Stanford, Charles
('rocker, Mark Hopkins, and Col
lis P.Huntington, each of whom
subscribed for 150 shares of the
stock. So far the corporation was
a creature of the California Legis
lature, and subject to regulation by
its statutes alone.
On July 1, 1862, after many
urgent requests by the California
Legislature, Congress passed the
first of the Pacific Railroad acts.
By this act the Union Pacific Rail
road Company was created, and
the corporation known as the
Central Pacific Railroad Company,
and existing under California
statutes, was adopted. That is, it
was made a part of the Congres
sional act, and given the same
privileges and subjected to the
same limitations as the Union
Pacific Railroad Company. The
two companies were to construct
their roads, the Union Pacific west
ward and the Central Pacific east
ward, until they met.
A more vital part of the act was
the land grant and the loan of
bonds made to the two companies.
Upon completion of forty miles of
the road fully equipped and ready
for service, the President was to
give patents for all the land granted,
and the Secretary of Treasury was
instructed to issue to the companies
$ 16,000 in bonds for each mile of
the road completed in accordance
with the requirements of the act.
A further provision was that five
per cent, of the net earnings of the
road was to be applied to the debt.
In case the bonds were not re
deemed as provided in the act, the
Secretary of Treasury should take
possession of the road with all
" rights, functions, immunities, and
appurtenances thereunto belong
ing," and all land granted.
This is the contract on which the
suit of the United States is based.
That is, for all the aid given the
companies they undertook to meet
the obligations imposed by the act,
or forfeit the property as above
mentioned. But whether or not
the stockholders in the corporations
are individually liable for their
ilebts, is the question to be decided.
We may start with the first broad
proposition that there is no com
mon-law liability for such a debt.
That liability is created alone by
statute. But it is maintained that
individual liability of stockholders
was created by statute in Cali
fornia and was in effect at the time
the Central Pacific Company was
incorporated under its laws. It is
further urged that the Constitution
of California has always imposed
individual liability upon stockhold
ers. The two sections of the Cali
fornia Constitution relating to the
matter read as follows : "Sec. 82.
Dues from corporations shall be
secured by such individual liability
of the corporations, and other
means as may be prescribed by
law." " Sec. 86. Each stockholder

of a corporation or joint-stock as
sociation shall he individually and
personally liable for his propor
tion of all its dehts and liabilities."
These two sections have been con
strued in the case of French vs.
Techemaker, 24 Cal. 518. It was
held in that case (1) that section
82 of the Constitution required posi
tive legislation, as will be seen by
reading the section ; and (2) that
section 3(5 was not self-execut
ing "in that it did not determine
the porportion of the debts and li
abilities of the corporation nor pre
scribe any rule by which such pro
portion could be ascertained";
and that the only way to put these
doubtful sections in operation was
by legislation.
The only statute in existence at
the time the Central Pacific was in
corporated was the one passed May
20, 1861. That statute says "each
stockholder shall be individually
liable to the creditors of such com
pany for his proportion — that is to
say, in proportion to the amount of
stock by him held for all the debts
and liabilities of such company."
This statute, though calculated to
give force to the Constitutional pro
vision. fails in the same essential
manner as the provision, viz., it is
indefinite. The rule is not laid
down by which the proportion is to
be ascertained. Subsequent legis
lation, it is true, clearly establishes
the rule, but it can have no bearing
on this case. It follows then that
the stockholders of the Central
Pacific are as free from any individ
ual liability as if there were no
constitutional or statutory regula
tion, for the simple reason that
there has been no clear and definite
legislation as required by the Con
stitution.
Hut even if the laws of California
in force at the time of making the
contract imposed individual liabil
ity upon the stockholders, the result
would be the same, for this is a
contract governed by the laws of the
United States and to which it is a
party. In determining the liability
of the stockholders the character of
the legislation creating the contract
must be considered. The legisla
tion is, as has been held in a case
to which the Union Pacific was a
party, sui generis or of a special or
peculiar kind. That is, Congress
was almost compelled to grant the
aid at the time it did. The de
mands of both the East and West
made it necessary that a transcon
tinental line be built, and that
Government aid be extended in its
construction. The very character
of the legislation is inconsistent
with any thought of individual li
ability of the stockholders. Neither
Congress nor the stockholders con
templated any such thing; and
moreover, no individual liability
was expressly fixed and none can
be implied.
