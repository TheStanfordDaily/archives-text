With the beginning of each fall
semester a chorus of complaints
arises about conflicts of lectures and
recitations. The head professors of
the different departments are in
clined to mass their strong courses
in the first two hours. From the
resulting conflict scores of students
must elect work that destroys the
unity and rationality of their
courses. Many find it impossible
to get important parts of the very
work that attracted them to the
University.
The professors in question have
very good reasons for arranging
their work as they do ; yet since the
result is so disastrous upon the
students' courses, something should
be done to remedy the evil.
