The Freshman is with us once
more. He is ignored by the Senior,
patronized by the Junior, and har
ried by the Sophomore, and as
usual the old round of " Freshie "
stories is revived for his benefit.
Deep in our hearts, however, we all
love the Freshman. Gradually the
new student will find that the
Sophomores are not so fierce as
they seem. After a Freshman sees
his old rivals done up in bailing
rope his reverence for them is
likely to be greatly lessened.
Slowly their men of brawn and
brain will make a place for them
selves, until they wake up some
morning and find themselves no
longer Freshmen. To participation
in college life, therefore, we welcome
'99 with the greeting we gave last
year to '98 : " God bless the Fresh
men; they'll be Seniors some day."
