Berkeley has every reason to
be proud of the record made by her
little team of eleven athletes on
their Eastern trip. With five vic
tories, one tie, and fifth place in
the Mott-Haven games, to their
credit, besides the glory of the
longest trip ever made by an ath
letic team, and but one defeat in
the opposite column of the account,
they could scarcely ask for more.
When they left on May 2, none but
a few of their most enthusiastic
admirers dared hope for any such
success. An unknown factor in the
Held of Eastern college antletics, the
California team occupied fora
month and a half the chief place
of interest in the world of sports,
and in every contest proved worthy
of the confidence placed in it by its
zealous supporters.
Although our rivals at home, the
Berkeley athletes carried with them
the Stanford good will, and, after
the men of their own university,
none rejoiced more sincerely over
their brilliant performances than
Stanford men.
