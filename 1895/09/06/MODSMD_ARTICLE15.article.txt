# Electro-Chemical Engineering.

We desire to call the attention of
entering students to Electro-Chemi
cal Engineering. This Held covers
the electro-deposition of metals,
electro-chemical decompositions,
such as the electro-metallurgy of
copper, silver, gold, and 1 ead ores,
the electrical refining of aluminum,
the electrical preparation of bleach
ing and dyeing agents, and the
electrical preparation of ozone and
chlorine for disinfecting purposes.
Also, the electrical preparation of
chemical agents by synthesis, such
as the manufacture of carborundum
for grinding and polishing, and the
electrical preparation of calcium
carbide for the manufacture of
acetylene used as illuminating gas.
This branch of electrical engi
neering is yet very largely unde
veloped and no one should under
take it simply to secure a position
with some established company;
but for men whose time, tastes, and
abilities will allow them to devote
at least five years to their studies
and fora considerable amount of
time pursue original investigations
on any of these lines, the field is
today the most promising one for
l he rising engineer.
Should any students desire to
enter this course, it will be neces
sary for them to announce the fact
at once t«» Prof. I'errine as the ap
propriate studies will include more
chemistry and metallurgy than is
assigned to the regular students in
electrical engineering and it would
he well for them to begin shaping
their course at once in this direc
tion. If any students enter this
course, it is designed to have an
instructor who will begin giving the
technical parts of the work three
years heme.
