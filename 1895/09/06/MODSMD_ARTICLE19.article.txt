At the beginning of this new year
we are inexpressibly shocked and
saddened by the death of Mrs.
Pease. The whole University
mourns her. Four years ago this,
month she shared with the others
of the pioneer faculty the vicissi
tudes of settling in the Llow, and
from those first eventful days on
ward her loyalty to the University,
her intense interest in all that
affected it, never failed.
Her judgments quick and keen
her ready wit, her vivid interest in
whatever she touched, proclaimed
the vitality of her mind. She was
alive to the tips of her fingers and
to the last and smallest of her pet
affections or aversions.
Her love for noble music and her
interpretation of it revealed a grasp
of imagination and a spiritual
delicacy and assurance which she
herself, with a characteristic aver
sion to cant or sham, never pre
tended to.
But those who were first at
tracted by her bright presence, or
struck by her musical rendering, or
entertained by her frank and racy
discourse, were held thereafter by
the warm and steadfast heart. As
we stood around the form which
had held her, one said, " She spoke
to me without being introduced
when I was a stranger here — I
thought it was so good " ; another,
"she welcomed me when I first
came, and insisted on my staying
all night at her house,although she
had not known me" ; a third, "she
came to see me every day when 1
was sick." And then we all fell to
remembering within ourselves the
unpremeditated kindnesses, small
and great, which, like threads of
gold, had bound our hearts to hers.
in these first sore moments one
may hardly touch upon her special
grace in the role of wife and house
mother. Yet here more than any
where else she would herself crave
appreciation. Her unflagging ac
tivity, her warm affection, her abil
ity and attainments, were first and
foremost dedicated to her home in
whole-souled, happy allegiance.
The wheels of the University stop
fora few hours to-day to pay trib
ute of silence to the passing of a
beautiful soul from tjie midst of us.
When the few broken words of
love are said, the tribute of those
to whom she was a dear, familiar
friend remains a bowed and stricken
silence.
