Undoubtedly the decision of
Judge Ross in the Government suit
against the estate is of more vital
interest to Stanford people than
any document or event of the sum
mer vacation. On the first page is
a brief abstract of it, stripped of
technicalities and legal phraseology
as much as possible, to make it
clear to the lay mind. Only the
leading points and those decisive
of the issue are presented. The
case was appealed, and will come
up for hearing before the Circuit
Court of Appeals next Tuesday,
Sept. 10. It will then go, regard
less of the decision, to the Supreme
Court of the United States, reach
ing a hearing there during the
October session. The final decision
will be rendered perhaps not later
than December.
