In order that work on the foot
ball Held may begin promptly,
necessary improvements made, and
pig-skins purchased, it is impera
tive that money be obtained.
The only source of revenue for
football expenses of the Hrst weeks
is the student body assessments.
Unless these are paid the hands of
the football manager are tied.
lOvery student intends to pay his
assessment eventually, but few real
ize the importance of paying it
promptly. The degree of energy
with which our football season shall
begin depends, not upon the man
ager and captain alone, but upon
the student body.
