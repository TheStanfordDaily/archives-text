# VICTORIOUS SOPHOMORES.
## After a Battle Royal, the Fin de Siecle Class Goes Down Before '98.

About <lusk <m Saturdayevening
squads of men strangely and
loosely attired could he seen hur
riedly making their way along
the different roads and by-ways
leading to the campus, while at
Kncina all was bustle in prepar
ation for the rush which had
been agreed upon by the mem
bers of the Sophomore and Fresh
man classes, to take place on the
baseball field at 7:30 p.m.
The freshmen began first to or
ganize their forces and took up
their position in the field directly
in front of Kncina. Besides the
hubbub and a unique and ex
pressive yell, specially prepared
for the occasion, the most marked
feature in the freshmen's camp
was a cylindrical box through
which shone in cardinal several
conspicuous '99's.
Amid defiant and deafening
veils from the assembled fresh
men, the main body of the soph
omore contingent tiled out of Kn
cina and made for their ap
pointed rallying grounds behind the
gvm. Closely packed together,
the '99 force proceeded towards
the backstop of the baseball field,
and there bracing themselves
awaited the charge of their op
ponents. They were not left long
in suspense. The sophomores
came on the field with a rush
which the freshmen met pluckily;
then fora moment nothing could
be seen but the cloud of dust ris
ing above the struggling mass.
Once begun the contest of mettle
and brawn was well fought. '99
struggled bravely to overcome the
handicap necessarily resting on a
new class, unfamiliar with its own
members and those of its oppon
ents. The field, covered with knots
of struggling men, calling for the
help of one class or another, was
indeed exciting. Soon the trium
phant yell of '98 began to denom
inate, and after three quarters of
an hour had elapsed hardly a
freshman was to be found untied,
liuses were secured which, closely
packed with freshmen guarded by
the grimy but happy sophomores,
were driven to Redwood, where the
'99s were unloaded and left to walk
home. Other freshman victims
were taken to the stock farm and
fastened to convenient fences, but
so loosely that they reached home
before their conquerors. Perhaps
the "most unkindest cut of all"
was the marching of freshmen
down past Roble where '98 took
pleasure in exhibiting them before
the dormitory of the co-eds.
