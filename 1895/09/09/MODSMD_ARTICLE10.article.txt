A list containing the names of
residents of Eneina and the
number of their rooms should be
placed in the lobby as soon as
possible by the committee. This
directory is exceedingly conven
ient, especially during the first
few weeks of each semester, when
it is most frequently used. As a
labor-saving proposition it is a
good one for the committee to
consider, for it relieves the mem
bers from answering innumerable
questions.
