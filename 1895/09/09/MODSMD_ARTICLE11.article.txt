The new college year opens lip
most auspiciously for Stanford
University. It seems that her star
is in the ascendant and a pros
perous year is before her. A
favorable decision has been rend
ered on the Government case
against the estate. Litigation is
not at an end, but with a favor
able opinion in the lower court
we can confidently expect a like
decision by the higher tribunal.
Once this great problem has been
finally disposed of, the vast en
dowment of the I'niversity may
be called into use to effect the
completion of plans which will
make our alwn water unequalled
in many way*- To be sure, there
is danger that many may expect
this fullness of development to be
realized sooner than it can pos
sibly be. Years will be required to
even approach the goal of the
founders' ideal; but the fact that
our progress in that direction is
constant is full of encouragement.
Then, too, our Faculty has been
: nereased in numbers by the ad

dition of several men and women,
who have established enviable
reputations in their respective lines
of investigation.
In athletics, the outlook was
never brighter. Notwithstanding
the absence of several of our star
football men, a majority of last
year's team is back and will soon
go into training. Much promis
ing new material has appeared,
so the future of Stanford on the
gridiron is not depressing in the
least. Track athletics will receive
some new men. Baseball is sure
to have help from incoming class
men. There seems no doubt that
we are to be able to boast of as
many victories for Stanford at the
end of next year as we did at the
end of last.
