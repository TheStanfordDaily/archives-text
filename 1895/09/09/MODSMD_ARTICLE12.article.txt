Last Saturday's rush established
a precedent that is quite likely to
be observed hereafter, and one that
is much in advance of the old
method. The idea of issuing a for
mal challenge and the acceptance
of it in an equally formal man
ner was a new and happy thought.
There is no better way fora class
to give proof of its physical sup
eriority in a conclusive style than
by a rush of which all contestants
are forewarned. This gives oppor
tunity for calling out every pos
sible resource of the class and
there is less ground for excuses
after the struggle is finished.
The good work, however, should
be carried one step further â€”let
one rush a semester settle all con
troversy between freshmen and
sophomores for that term. The
thought of having a rush precipi
tated at any time seems ludicrous.
One or two wholesome struggles
during the college year may be
allowable; but the contending
classes themselves should see that
these meetings do not exceed that
number. Let the class superiority
be settled and let the matter rest
there.
