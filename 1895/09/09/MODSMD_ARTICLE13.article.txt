The University kindergarten will
open on Monday, Sept. Si, 1895, in
the same room where it was held
last year. Miss (lenevra Sisson,
who was in charge of the Univer
sity kindergarten a year ago, and
who has heen in charge of the
kindergarten work in Santa Cruz
during the past year, will teach the
kindergarten. The session will he
from 10:80 to 12:80 on all the days
when the University is in session.
Miss Sisson is to he paid $20 a
month, and there will he some
small incidental expenses for sup
plies. This will make necessary
a fee of $2.50 a month. Since
the expense oi maintaining the
kindergarten is the same whether
the children are present or absent,
it seems only right that this fee
should he paid for fragments of
Ihe month and for partial attend
ance as well as for whole months.
We have an excellent room and the
best kindergarten teacher that I
know in California, and I antici
pate a good year's work. Very
respectfully, Eakl Barnes.
