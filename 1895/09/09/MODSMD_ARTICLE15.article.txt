The University Library is grad
ually being augmented by the ad
dition of valuable donations and
purchases. The latest addition is
a gift from Mrs. Stanford and Mr.
Timothy Hopkins. Two choice
oil paintings—one of Senator Stan
ford and one of Mark Hopkins—
constitute the most valuable part
of the new gift. The portrait of
the late Senator is a magnificent
one and is one of the best pieces of
work ever done by Charles Merch,
a talented young artist. There are
s-everal old paintings obtained
from some of the oldest Virginia
families; while scenes of early Cal
ifornia days add to the interest of
the pictures. In order to make the
Railroad Library more complete,
Mr. Hopkins has lately donated
several costly railroad drawings.
The Hildebrand Library, pur
chased before the close of last se
mester, is now divided into two sec
tions. This allows of its fullest
use by students. One section is in
the Library, while the other has
been placed in the German depart
ment.
