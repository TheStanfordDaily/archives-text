The students of Stanford Univer
sity will have a rare opportunity
to hear the famous lecturer, Prof.
Wm, M. Tomlins, on "The Rela
tion of Music to Education," next
Tuesday night.
Prof. Tomlins is well known
throughout the United States as an
instructor in music and a most
pleasing lecturer. During the
World's Fair in Chicago he was
the leader of the children's chorus,
and his work attracted the atten
tion of musicians all over (lie

world, lie has occupied the pos
ition of musical director in the
Chicago public schools, has taught
a large class of children in that
city, and at the same time has
spent a great part of his time in
instructing the poor children who
were unable to pay for his service.
Prof. Tomlins says that he came
to the Coast fora rest, but hardly
had he arrived until he was almost
compelled by those who had heard
of his work to enter the field again.
During the time he has been here
he has been instructor in music in
the Girl's High School at San
Francisco, besides carrying on his
usual work for the poor, which has
always occupied a large part of his
time. Whenever he has lectured
he has been noted for his humor
and wit as well as his great power
for creating enthusiasm.
In view of his reputation as a
lecturer alone, we should consider
ourselves very fortunate in this op
portunity to hear him.
At the present time an effort is
being made to establish a large
chorus of 200 male and female
voices, so that on any occasion of
note, instead of listening to some
solitary singer, the Stanford stud
ent may be greeted by a chorus of
some size. A course in harmony
will probably be given, for which
the student will receive University
credit. A competent instructor
will be employed and those in
charge of the matter already have
one in view who is known to be ef
ficient in every way.
In view of these facts it is indeed
fortunate that we will have such a
man as Prof. Tomlins to arouse
enthusiasm and lead to the forma
tion of one of the largest of college
choruses, as contemplated.
