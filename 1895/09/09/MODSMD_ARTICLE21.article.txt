# The
						Football Outlook.
## 
### 
A large number of the old play
ers are back, and preparations are
already beginning for the coming
contest. Among those who have
arrived are Cockran, Field, Fickert,
Code, Burnett, Spaulding, Cotton,
Reynolds, Frankenheimer, Dole,
Soper, Pauly, McCray, and Thomas.
While our prospects for victory
this year are not any too bright,
yet some good new material offers
itself. The boys will soon be ready
to go into training, and some im
provements on the oval, the exact
nature of which cannot be an
nounced until after the meeting of
the Executive Committee tonight,
will be promptly made.
The reports of some of the city
papers concerning the engagement
of Walter Camp as coach are not
confirmed by Manager Eaton.
Neither has any contract been
signed fora lease of grounds for
the game. The Haight Street
grounds are not available. It is
very probable that the Central
Park grounds will be chosen and
duly equipped by the erection of a
new grandstand and dressing
rooms, baths, etc., besides the re
moval of the old asphalt bicycle
track.
