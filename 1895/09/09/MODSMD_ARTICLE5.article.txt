# The
						Sunday Morning Sermon.

### 
The sermon yesterday was
preached by Dr. Thoburn, on the
subject, "How a man is made," j
and was prefaced by the following i
"Legend of the will":
"There is a legend which tells!
that the spirits who serve the Evil
One once undertook to make aj
man —one who could be sent forth ;
upon the earth to mix with other j
men and seem like them, and yet
serve Satan and have his face fixed |
toward hell.
"So they threw into a boiling
chaldron mould gathered from
ancient graves, and dust from
paths where many feet had trod,
and fragments picked from the
shores of the sea, and water from
the (ireat River where wild beasts
came to slack their thirst ; and
then, while some watched and
stirred with the greatest care,
others were sent up and down the
earth to bring their offerings to
this place of impish art.
"One caught the breath of a new
born babe and dipped it in a curse
escaping from the feverish lips of
a libertine. One brought hope,
another fear. One linked love and
license; another bound together
ambition and avarice. One turned
beautiful pictures toward the earth
so that the beasts might see them
and took what the beasts saw.
One imp filled a summer land
scape with vile creatures and strug
gling forms and took what he
saw. One fallen angel who had
been of those driven from the
battlements of Heaven brought a
fragment of his memory of the
glories of Paradise, of the Great
White Throne, ami the Father's
face: he would gladly have thrown
it all in, but it was not permitted
him.
"So, from many lands and places
came the gifts to the new man.
They were dropped into the
chaldron, which was stirred and
watched by the wisest spirits of
darkness, and imps danced on the
edge of the chaldron and fed its
lire from the lake that burns al
ways; and Hell resounded with
plaudits because of the great work.
"Now, it happened that just be
fore the mixture was poured into
the mould, an angel of light Hying
before the gates of Hell dropped
into the chaldron a will which he
had taken from the bosom of a
martyr, and the devils did not see
it while they stirred, and poured
the whole forth into the mould that
was fashioned according to the form
of man. And Satan himself
breathed on it, and the man was
made. And he stepped forth and
fought with those devils and over
came them. And he tied from
Hell, and dwelt among men, and
ruled himself, and was loved by
men. And when he came to die,
and Satan sent to claim all that
belonged to him, there was nothing
left. God had taken all."
I wish to give special prominence
to the human side of character
making— to your part in building
yourselves. The key to life is en
deavor. Unlike the child, which
looking at an animal sees all the
curious colors and brilliant things,
the naturalist sees in each one of
the organs something that the
animal has done, and knows that

it is the result of acts far back.
So with us ; we are the results of
what have gone before.
Nature arranges it so that only
the victors possess the earth.
Whatever may be our opportuni
ties here, we are not here to have
an easy time; you must overcome,
or die. When man is acted upon
by things new to him there must
be either a growth or a funeral;
and not what we believe but what
we have done makes the man.
It takes a whole man to be
righteous and pure. If you are
weak and unable to bridle your
self, do not think that in answer
to your prayer Heaven will send
you a power which you should be
developing now; there is no will
in Heaven fora weak man. The
men of the world who are not
doing anything are remarkable for
the organs which they do not
possess. Live with your better
selves, and the other selves will
soon die of lonesomeness. The world
is not suffering so much from low
ideals as from not living up to the
ideals already formed.
1 wish to call attention to three
laws which govern activity:
First, the law of use. As with
an organ of power, which, if not
used, disappears, so with an ele
ment of character; it must have
its share of exercise, or it will wither
and die. We cannot play with sin.
We may repent, and the Father
may take us home again, but the
things we did in the far country will
exist as a nightmare all the rest of
our lives. Wild oats may be sown
by the handful, but the harvest of a
life-time will not fully atone for
it.
Second, the law of accounta
bility. "To whomsoever much is
given, much shall be required."
Our possessions, whether of wealth
or knowledge, bring to us oppor
tunities for winning or losing.
Nature stands over every talent
and says, "Win it or lose it." But
by activity alone can we win, and
keep; and this activity, moreover,
must be our own. It is an evil to
allow others to do our thinking and
our praying, and to think that this
is religious life.
Third, the best of all, the law of
giving. Nature permits no drone,
and not a single animal lives or is
allowed to live for itself; man is
nothing if he gives himself to him
self — he becomes one of those ex
tinct things which nature has been
so busy making all the ages. Men
sometimes give a tenth to the Lord;
nature exacts all. All your train
ing has not found the reason for its
existence until it has found it in
the heart of humanity. Here in
the University you cannot be re
ligious by yourself. He who loses
self as Christ did shall like Christ
lind self in the end.
