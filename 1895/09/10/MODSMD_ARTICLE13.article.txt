Professors students are
uniting to give advice to the ver
dant freshman; the new student's
head must swim, sometimes, when
he realizes what volumes of good
advice are being hurled at his in
offensive young head. Everyone,
from the professor who tells him
hard work wins, to the senior who
tells him,"Never mind Greek gram
mar, but lay fora pull with your
major prof./' has a stock of axioms
ready for the new student.
