Those who have been so fortunate
as to have work under Prof. W. J.
Hussey regret deeply that the Uni
versity is to lose him. All share
this sentiment, for Stanford stu
dents are proud of his fame. How
ever, his new position as astronomer
at Lick Observatory, as successor
to Prof. Barnard, gives him un
rivalled opportunities to increase
that fame and add to the world's
stock of knowledge. When he
leaves the University next January,
Prof. Hussey will take with him the
best wishes of students and faculty.
