The first number of Vol. I of
"The College Idea," a bi-weekly
published by the students of the
University of Washington, has been
received at this office. The new
journal is neat typographically and
its matter is of a high grade. On
the whole it is a creditable repre
sentative of the growing young uni
versity of the North Pacific Coast.
The University of Washington,
richly endowed and with progres
sive men at the helm, is destined
to be an important factor in educa
tional development. It is a pleas
ure to note that its students are
keeping pace in enterprise with the
institution.
