The controversy over the loca
tion of the football field is liable to
seriously handicap the beginning
of practice here unless it be speed
ily settled. Track men very justly
insist that if the oval be used for
any games whatever, our costly
track will be ruined by spectators.
Last season there was some com
plaint, though at that time the
track was barely begun. Now that
it has been completed at such a
considerable expense, no one will
deny that every possible precaution
should be observed to keep it in
first-class condition.
Others assert that, so far as pos
sible, our athletic field and track
should be centralized in one plot of
ground. Further, that it would
entail considerable unnecessary ex
pense to put another field in shape
for practice which should begin at
once. Then, too, if Stanford ever
expects to have a grandstand it is
bound to be placed at the side of
the oval, so any expenditure
towards fitting up another field
will be ultimately wasted.
It must appear that there is con
siderable reason in the arguments
of the latter class of students.
This being the case, why would
it not be possible to fence in the
entire track with cheap material,
as wire netting, leaving an open
ing or two as entrances to the
oval. There would still be ample
room between the inner space and
the side lines. Whatever is done
in regard to the matter should be
done at once. Some action will
doubtless be taken by the Athletic
Committee at its coming meeting.
