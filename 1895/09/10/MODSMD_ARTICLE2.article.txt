Bureau, was elected president of the
University of Washington with a
salary of $5,000 a year, at a meet
ing of the Board of Regents on Aug

and has entered upon the discharge
of his duties. The loss to the
Weather Bureau, a case of ex

lias resulted in a marked gain to
the Coast.

at the University of Michigan, did
his first work in astronomy under
Prof. Harrington, who was then
occupying that chair at Ann
