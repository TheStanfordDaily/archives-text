# Stanford Summer School.
## 
### 
Summer school opened on the
17th of June, and closed about
six weeks later. Not only students
from this University, but also a
large number of students and even
college professors took advantage of
this opportunity. There was a
large increase of students who took
the courses in summer work com
pared with the number who took
the work last year. Courses were
given in Greek, Latin, German,
English, Economics, Mathematics,
Chemistry, Hygiene and Physical
Training, Civil Engineering, also
Shorthand and Typewriting. The
professors and instructors in charge
of these several branches were Fair
dougli, Kirtland, Murray, Elmore,
Goebel, liendtorff, Hrun, Fluegel,
Hudson, Lathroj), Hardy, Jenness,
Green, Cox, Young, Myers, Adams,
Fish, Mosher, Farmer, Clark, Wood,
and March.
About one hundred and thirty
took these summer courses; of this
number about forty attended at
Pacific Grove. The courses given
there were in Botany, Zoology, and
Physiology, under Professors Shaw,
Heath, Gilbert, Jenkins, and Green.
The work of these professors was
supplemented by lectures.
Quite a large addition to the
facilities of the laboratory was
made by the building of a 20,000
gallon tank fora salt water res
ervoir. Much admirable individ
ual work was done by the students,
pleasure -being merely a "side issue"
to this work. A number of camp
ing trips to Point Lobos and vicin
ity, and student sports, played an
important part in the life at the
station of Pacific Grove. After the
regular six weeks' stay there were
still about a dozen students who re
mained to do work till college
opened for the year's work.
Among prominent persons who
did work at Pacific Grove this
summer were Prof. Surface of
Napa College, S. 1). Briggs '1)2,
Prof. Keep, author of "Coast
Shells," and I). A. Saunders of
Lincoln, Neb., who was accom
panied by an artist. The pro
fessors engaged in the courses ex
press entire satisfaction with the
work done. The summer school
was a decided success in more
ways than one.
