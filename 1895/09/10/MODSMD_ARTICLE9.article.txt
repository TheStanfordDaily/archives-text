All candidates for the football

at 5 p.m. in the gymnasium. Men
should appear in suitable attire for
gymnasium exercise, as an annex
to one of the gymnasium classes
will he formed, consisting of all
football men.
Guy Cochran, Captain.
Captain Cochran's notice to foot
ball conciliates looks as though
work was to begin at once. It is
his intention to get men out every
evening from now on to practice
kicking and light work. An effort
will he made to divide the squad
into two sections, one of which will
work in the gymnasium and another
in the lield, alternating them daily.
