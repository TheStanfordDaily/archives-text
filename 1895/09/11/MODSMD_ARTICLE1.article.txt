# This Afternoon's Lecture.

### 
When Prof. Royce entered the
chapel at 4 o'clock this afternoon a
large and enthusiastic audience!
greeted him. For over an hour the
distinguished professor held undi-1
vided attention by his lecture on:
the "Imitation of Childhood," of j
which the following is a brief ab-j
stract.
For the last two or three years
I have leen endeavoring to study
some of the facts connected with
imitation and its place in human
nature.
By the name imitation, I mean
in the first place a very familiar
group of processes going on in us
all the time. When we repeat the
words of another after him, we em
ploy the processes of imitation.
Meanwhile as soon as one begins
to ask how early we begin to imi
tate, one finds it impossible to ap
ply the word imitation. The word
imitation is a word whose meaning
is peculiarly difficult to define.
When we attempt to imitate other
people we attempt to do as they
do, to speak as they speak, and to
feel as they feel. With the gay
and joyous we rejoice; with the sor
rowful we sorrow.
And so by imitation we mean
those processes which tend to bring
about this mental contagion.
lint we have to go further; these
processes result when we do not in
tend that they should result.
People in an audience are imitating
one another without being con
scious of it; and so with a great
part of our imitation; we are not
conscious of its presence.
The imitative functions are those
that express the actions of others.
They are processes that lead to ac
tions which a person can perceive
to be imitated without the person
imitating being aware of the
fact.
Some people are disposed to sep
arate the imitative part of our life
by saying that sometimes we are
imitative; but you can not possibly
divide up human conduct into two
parts, to say that one part is imi
tative and the other is not. Imi
tation runs through all of one's life.
There is no important action in
any organized being in the world
that has no imitative aspect. We
are said to express ourselves orig
inally in our mother tongue, yet as
a matter of course every word that
we speak we have learned from
others. Just so all the functions
that we possess we get from other
people. A man's functions then
are imitative functions; yet we use
them all the time as though they
were our own.
It is no longer possible to separ
ate our life and to say there is an
imitative part and there is an orig
inal part. People often say that
young children are imitative but
grown people are original. By
many such means we insist on the
consideration that part of our life
is the imitative part and the rest is
the original part. The imitation
that we desire is doing what others
do without knowing what we are
doing.
Hut how does it come that we
human beings are such imitators
as we are; how does this tendency
arise? Imitation is absent in in
fants, but very slowly the observer

begins to notice tendencies which
denote imitation. A child begins
to do what everyone will agree to
be imitation; the imitation of
movements, the imitation of sylla
bles.
Thus we have a very rapid de
velopment of literal imitations,
saying what other people say,
doing what other people do. From
the outset that union, that connec
tion of imitation, seems quickly to
appear.
A person of uncontrollable imi
tation is not an abnormal one. If
the imitativeness were uncontroll
able, one would not record the imi
tativeness but the control.
We are influenced by our envir
onment more than we intend to be.
This influence is not direct, but it
tends to become indirect. If I imi
tate I have capacity; that capacity
is social capacity, and if 1 learn
from some of my fellows, it of
course belongs to I lie socially pos
sible; that is what i stand for, that
is what I offer to society. In that
way our imitations work into the
rest of life. But if, in all these
ways, imitations enter into the rest
of our lives, it of course has no in
tention.
