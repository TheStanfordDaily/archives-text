It seems that it is going to he
necessary to appoint a watchman
for the law library, from the rapid
ity with which books are disap
pearing from that department. If
a watchman is necessary, let us
have him at once, and prevent
further depredations by a few on
the many. All the law classes are
filled to overflowing ; their work is
largely case work which requires
constant use of the law library. If
a few selfish students take the books
out, even temporarily, they encroach
on the rights of several classes.
Until the present semester there
has been little cause for complaint
on this score ; but the matter has
already become a serious one this
year and should not be allowed to
continue fora day.
