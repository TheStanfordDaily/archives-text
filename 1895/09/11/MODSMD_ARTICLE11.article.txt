It is but fair to correct the inter
pretation of a somewhat mislead
ing statement that appeared in last
evening's Daily Palo Alto regard
ing last year's debts. The state
ment was made that the Executive
Committee had decided not to hold
the treasurer of the Associated
Students liable for last year's
debts. This does not mean that
they are not to be paid, but simply
that old debts will not be taken
into consideration when making
up the percentage on profits to be
paid the treasurer.
Had no such action been taken,
a considerable injustice would have
been done the present treasurer,
as the debts of last year might pos
sibly have absorbed the better part
of the profits of this year.
