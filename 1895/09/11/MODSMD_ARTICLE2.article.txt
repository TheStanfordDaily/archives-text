# How Students Spend Their Summer.
## 
### 
During the recent summer vaca
tion many Stanford students have
spent their time in climbing moun
tains or in camping upon the
shores of some lonely lake or
river.
Messrs. Mills, '96, Switzer, '98,
Moore, '96, and Oskison, '98,
started June 1 for the Yosemite
Valley by way of Stockton. After
leaving Stockton about thirty miles
behind, they procured burros and
packing them with their camping
outfit and provisions walked 100
miles to the valley. Here they
spent a week in viewing the scen
ery. They made their return trip
by way of Angels, where they saw
several Stanford students working
in the mines. After leaving An
gels they went by the Calaveras big
trees, and here, as they express it,
they saw the greatest wonder of all.
They occupied a month's time on
their trip, and their most notable
attempt was the climbing of Clouds'
Rest, which is 10,000 feet high.
They pitched a (ramp upon its
summit, naming it"Camp Stan
ford."
C. A. Baldwin, '98, left Denver
on July 1 with a party for the
San Juan and Sangre de Christo
creeks, where they caught mountain
trout until the rains put a stop to
their sport. They then struck for
the mountains and camped 10,000
feet above the sea level. While
making the last move, one of their
horses broke his leg and Mr. Bald
win had to make a two day's ride
for another horse. He had a novel
experience on his return to camp,
traveling for three or four miles
just a little above the clouds which
were gathered and tossed just be
i low him. After camping seven
weeks at this altitude, they started
|to ascend Mt. Blanc, which stands
jas the highest mountain in the
â–  State of Colorado. They went but
little beyond the snow line, bow
ever. But here they found many
lakes covered with ice and hills
covered with crusted snow.
