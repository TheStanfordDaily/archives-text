# The 						Relation of Music to Education.
## 
### 
Prof. William L. Tomlins, of
Chicago, last night gave a rare
treat in his lecture on "The Rela
tion of Music to Education"; to
attempt to give within the limits of
a newspaper report any idea of his
effort is almost useless.
He said in part: Music appeals
to all civilization, under almost all
conditions. Where a few people
are gathered together, there music
seems to go with appropriateness;
it seems to come to us, and, when
we are in the proper spiritual and
emotional modes, to tit to us, and
not we to it. liuskin tells us that
a young lady may mourn the death
of her lover in song, but that the
miser cannot mourn the loss of his
gold in song.
In power, music is magical. To
the superficial observer John B.
(Sough would often seem at first to
endeavor merely to entertain his
audience, but he was rather en
deavoring to arouse their sym
pathies, and after touching the
whole gamut of their emotions he
would suddenly strike right home.
And yet, what (lough could do in
an hour, Patti could do with a
verse of " Home, Sweet Home."
She harmonized her audience, such
that those who had entered her
presence selfish and abstracted soon
threw off their unnaturalness, and
spoke a word of congratulation to
their neighbor, or gave a bow of
appreciation. And that which
Patti has you may all have, to a
certain extent, and the balm and
charm of music may be harnessed
and made to do good service in
education in all phases of life.
Now the question arises, if the
power of song is so great, how is it
that these people who were so en
thused by Patti go home and soon
forget her ? The answer is found
in the matter of degree. The power
of the lightning was at a time far
back seen only in the flash; now it
is seen everywhere. So with music;
fora moment God's face gives to
you a new flash, and tells you what
you should be, and shall be.
What is it, then, that Patti has ?
She is natural. The sound of her
voice the key to her complete
self; it is sweet, and fervent, and
it not only lives but gives out life
to others ; it shows her to be a
ui ique personage on the stage of
human life. And you and I ought
t<> he unique. The song must be
the exj rt:sion of the feelings,of the
emotions, of the soul within, and
not the mere utterance of words in
a tune; and this being so, it re
quires brains and wealth of soul to
excel in music as well as in any
other art.
If you go into a church belfry at
night and strike the lower part of
the bell, you will find that the tone
gradually dies away, but that by
listening closely you will hear little
sounds, the faintest quality of
tones, still coming from the upper
part of the bell. These are the
higher harmonics, and upon the
number and variety of them de
pends the quality of the tone. This
is the way to determine the quality
of a bell. But there is one very
important difference between a bell
and a human being: the material
of the bell is homogeneous, and its
tone will be the same whether it

speaks to tliis room or to the whole
town; but in me there is faith,
love, hope, sorrow and all the pas
sions that thrill the human breast,
and hence the difference in the
range of the music. If you put
your ear to the bell in the dead of
night you will hear what will seem
to indicate that the bell is dream
ing, and dreaming, and dreaming
of spirit bells. So it is that while
the lower harmonics make for the
physical tones, just so do the
higher harmonics make for the,
higher spiritual tones. And it was
in these higher harmonics that
Whittier and Milton wrote and
Dante sung. Again, if the har
monics make for the quality of
tone, the quality of tone makes for
harmonics. The true singer receives
more music into his soul than he
gives out. But in order to be such
a singer, one must surely possess
three things, thought, feeling, and
will; one or the other of these will
be brought into predominate play
in different kinds of music, but
they must all be present.
In one of my classes in Chicago
uncommon progress was made un
til, when 1 began to give public con
certs, the bane of self-consciousness
crept in and threatened to overthrow
all. The trouble was that the audi
ences were of the better classes of
the city, and the singers at once
caught the idea that they were
somebody. The thought came to
me that there must be some way to
obviate that evil, and turn all this
effort to good account; and so I be
gan my work with the wage workers,
the success of which has proved so
gratifying.
The industrial complications are
becoming a most stupendous prob
lem. The difficulty with the wage
earner is that he has lost his self
respect, and is therefore without a
purpose in life.
Now, an example of the power of
music as an educator. We began
to hold our concerts before these
wage-earning classes. The price of
admission did not cover the ex
penses, for the best talent was pro
cured regardless of cost. Once they
became interested in the concert
they began to desire themselves to
learn to sing, and after the first
concert 22,000 applications were
received.
