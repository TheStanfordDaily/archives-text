The fact of the University tro
phies —particularly athletic—being
allowed to remain uncollected, has
occasioned considerable surprise
and some comment. The different
managers or captains, as the case
may have been, have taken these
things into their possession for safe
keeping and there they remain.
This was perfectly in accord with
the duties of their positions, but
now the time has come when these
hard-earned souvenirs of victory
should be gathered together and
placed where the student body may
feel that it has something tangible.
The Museum is the best possible
place for them.
