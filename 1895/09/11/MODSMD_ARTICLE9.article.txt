Next Saturday night has been
dedicated to Stanford by the man
agement of the Mechanics' Fair in
San Francisco. The regular Satur
day to Monday fare for the round
trip will also secure admission to
the Fair. Every effort will be
made to make the evening enjoy
able to the wearers of the cardinal.
Stanford music under the leader
ship of a Stanfoid director will add
to the enthusiasn of the occasion.
On the recent University of
California evening over five hun
dred Berkeley students were present
besides many more of their friends
in the city and about the bay.
There were very few people along
Market street and in the vicinity
of the Mechanics' Pavilion that did
not realize that it was a students'
night. Blue and gold was in evi
dence everywhere and harmless col
lege fun characterized the evening.
Stanford should not be less en
thusiastic when our time comes
next Saturday. Our delegation

may lie smaller, but in the charac
ter of the musical program we shall
have Â«t decided advantage over our
rival across the hay. A little in
terest and enthusiasm may easily
make up the rest in making the
occasion a pleasant one.
