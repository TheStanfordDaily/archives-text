# VARSITY CANDIDATES.
## Football Players Respond to Capt. Cochran's Call and Begin Work. 
### 
The first opportunity for an ex
amination of our football material
this season was presented last night
when a score of candidates met at
the gymnasium. Capt. Cochran
issued the notice that all men
should appear at the gymnasium at
5 o'clock, and while there were as
many avowed candidates for the
eleven absent as there were present,
-till the number that did appear
was <|iiite satisfactory. Students
who were in attendance last season
will remember that it was late in
September before two full elevens
lined up against each other. From
the showing last night Stanford
will have two good teams to start
with from the first this year. Capt.
Cochran does not intend, however,
to put the men into practice games
at once.
The exercise which the boys went
through last evening is a fair ex
ample of what they will do for per
haps a week. In addition, however,
there will be light lield-work given
the players under the captain's
supervision.
The gymnasium exercises con
sisted of machine work and tumbl
ing; the latter is to limber up some
of the men whose muscles have be
come stiff. Several of the players
today will take a long distance run
to improve their wind.
Among those who turned out
were Fickert, '97, Paulv, '98, Crow,
'98, Cochran (Capt.), "9(>, Carle,'9B,
Piatt, '99, Weldon, '97, Arnold, '97,
Frankenheinier, '96, Harrington,
'98, (iarten, '98, Dillon, '99, Cotton,
'98, and several others. Code, *9(Â»,
Spaulding, "9(>, Allen, '98, Bradley,
'99, Reynolds, '90, Field, '9(J, are
all undecided whether they will be
able to play or not; while Burnett
is sure to work for his old position
and Dole, '98, is out fora place.
It is not unlikely that all the above
mentioned players will lie seen on
the field before the first match game
with Reliance.
