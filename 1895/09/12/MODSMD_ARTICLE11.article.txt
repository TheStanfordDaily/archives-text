### 
A committee from the board of
university regents, consisting of
Hon. J. West Martin, (Jeneral J. F.
Houghton, and Colonel C. F. j
Crocker, visited Berkeley today,
and in company with President
Kellogg and Professor Clapp, tlie
faculty representatives of the student
athletic committee, looked over the!
proposed site for the new athletic:
Held on the campus. It is the de
sire of the student body to have
better facilities for the various kinds
of athletic sports; and in order to do,
this in the manner wished, a re-j
quest has been made of the board
of regents to grant them the use of;
:i strip of land 100 feet wide on the
east side of the present running
track, and extending throughout its j
length.
If the request is complied with
work will at once be commenced on
the construction of a new three laps'
(o the mile cinder path, football j
tield, and baseball diamond, the,
whole to be inclosed within a high
hoard fence. The committee ex
pressed a kindly feeling toward the i
project. Professor Clapp said:
'"It has been a long cherished de
sire on the part of those interested
in college athletics to have an in
closed field of their own in which
the various contests can be held,
and after careful consideration of
the project by the faculty com
mit tee on supervision of student
athletics, consisting of Professors]
Bacon, Edwards, and myself, and
also by the athletic executive com
mittee, it was decided to make a
request for the piece of ground
mentioned. It will bean ideal spot
for an athletic tield, on account of
its situation in reference to other
parts of the campus, its compara
tive smoothness, and also on ac
count of the many shade trees
which surround it.
"The entire cost of grading, build
ing the fence, and erecting a suit
able grandstand will be about
$2500. A tasteful fence will be put
up, and around it trees and vines
will be planted, so as to relieve the
utter bareness of the place. Though
work will beat once commenced on
laying out the field, yet we do not
expect to hold the great game with
Stanford on if this year. It is in
tended that -o.ne of the big games
in the future will be played here,
since by doing so the demoralizing
effect attendant upon the holding
of intercollegiate games in San
Francisco will be done away with.
Stanford, as 1 am told, is working
to the same end, and they, too, ex
pect to soon have an inclosed field
of their own. 11 is intended to
erect a stone wait some future
time in place of the wooden fence,
after the manner of Yale and Penn
sylvania; but that will only come
with time."
Herbert Lang, manager of the
football team, is very enthusiastic
over the plan, and feels confident
that the receipts taken in at the
gate will soon pay for the outlay
made in fitting up the grounds.
The matter will be brought Tip
at the meeting of the regents to
morrow afternoon, and if the prop
osition is favorably passed upon
the football field may be put into
condition at once, so as to be ready
for the fall practice games. S. F.
