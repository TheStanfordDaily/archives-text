# A 						Fraternity Number.
## 
### 
The Berkeley Herald has issued
a fraternity number, a copy <>'
which has reached this office. It is
well printed on book paper and is
made additionally attractive by
cuts of all the University of Cali
fornia chapter houses. A short
history of each of the fraternities is
a leading feature; but the part of
most general interest is two arti
cles on college fraternities, one by
President Kellogg and the other by
Dr. Jordan. Each discusses very
fairly the good and the harmful
side of the Greek-letter societies.
In regard to possible harmful in
fluences Dr. Jordan tersely says,
"The invertebrate boy is in danger
everywhere."
