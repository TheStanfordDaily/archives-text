# Some More Outings.

### 
In continuing the narration of
summer trips the name of O. V.
Eaton, '95, should probably ap
pear first, as he travelled over more
territory and spent more time in
his travels than any other student.
He accompanied Dr. and Mrs.
Jordan to the Yellowstone Park,
their party being the iirst on the
grounds. They spent a week view
ing the many strange sights which
everyone beholds in visiting the
Yellowstone region.
Mr. Eaton then left the par!)'
and returned to California, passing
through Spokane,Seattle,and Port
land. He made a short stop at
both of th<* last-named places.
He next visited the Yosemite Val
ley and saw the main places of in
terest. From here he started on a
southern tour, visiting Los Angeles
and other prominent Southern
towns. He continued his trip
through New Mexico into old
Mexico itself, and then back over
Texas to New Orleans, through
Alabama, Tennessee, and other
Southern states. While in the
South he visited the Louisiana I'ni
versitv and other state institutions.

From here he went north through
Tennessee and Kentucky to 11 is
home in Indiana, where he visited
a few days. Again he set out upon
his travel?, this time going east
ward. He stopped at Niagara Falls
fora few days and then took a trip
on the (ireat Lakes, crossing over
to the Canadian side and landing
at Toronto. Soon after he began
his homeward journey, passing
through tlie Province of Ontario to
Detroit, then to Indianapolis, Chi
cago, and St. Paul. From the latter
place he took the Canadian Pacific
and returned to Stanford hy his
previous route through Washington,
then hy steamer to San Francisco.
Dr. Myers, Professor Fairclough,
and G. \V. Scott, '9f>, left Stanford
immediately after the completion
of the summer course and went to
Raymond, where they secured pack
horses to carry their bedding and
provisions, and then walked to the
Yosemite by the mountain trails,
keeping clear of the beaten path,
as by doing so they might obtain a
splendid view of Inspiration Point.
They stopped at the Mariposa Big
Trees a,ml other places of interest
along the road. On reaching the
Valley they made a permanent
camp arid visited all the interest
ing places from this camp, starting
out in the morning and generally
returning to camp in the evening.
They left the Valley by way of
the Pig Oak Flat road, which leads
through the placer mining district.
They stopped at Chirca Camp and
other mining camps where work
was going on. When they arrived
at Milton they took the train for
Stockton and from Stockton they
travelled to the city by boat.
After their arrival at Stanford
the party broke up and Dr. Myers
proceeded alone to the Madrone
Springs on hunting expedition.
Here he found Prof. Wing and
Prof. Marx, who had gone there in
the earlier part of the summer.
He made a stay of eleven days here
and returned just as the Univers
ity opened.
Among those who have made
notable trips are Mr. W. 11.
Reeves and his sister, Miss Minnie
Reeves, both of the class of '95.
They ascended the north side of
Mt. Ranier to the height of 11,000
feet. Considering the fact that no
one has as yet reached the top
from that side,they both feel justly
proud of their achievement. They
went up the old "Bailey Willis"
trail, which was cut through by
the Northern Pacific Railroad ten
years ago and has never been re
opened, consequently they met with
many difficult passages. They
made their way safely with their
horses, however, and found many
grassy plains for them to graze
upon. They pitched their hist
camp at the snow line and saw the
Puyallup and White River glaciers
as their ice was gradually turned
into water. Mr. Reeves says 11.: t,
the variety of the flora is some
thing surprising. They found
upon ihc-u heights heather and
bluebells almost exactly like their
Scotch varieties. They also saw
the rare whistling marmot, but
were unable to gain possession of a
live one. In spite of the dangerous
climbing of mountains and glaciers
they enjoyed their trip immensely.

The Second Lecture by Prof. Royce.
The threatening aspect of the
weather last night interfered some
what with the attendance at Prof.
Josiah Royce's lecture in the
chapel, so that a rather small
though appreciative audience was
present. The following is an ab
stract of the lecture:
The topic of the paper is "Some
Observations of the Anomalies of
Self-Consciousness." In this paper
! I shall venture to lay some stress
j on the factors that permit the
growth of consciousness. In its
inner aspects, what we mean by
self-consciousness is a complex
function. There are in any person
certain established habits of action.
The man who is self-conscious is
normal if his means of expressing
himself are intact; he must be able
I to tell who he is, he must estimate
his place in society. He must show
a certain degree of aceurateness as
to his knowledge of his body.
This normal consciousness has
often been analyzed. It involves
i first, masses of bodily senses. The
region of these senses lies in the
skin. If any of these masses of
sensory contents are altered they
may alter our feeling of self. In
short, the rule holds that the more
we localize these senses the less we
feel them in our bodily strength.
; Second, it means what we may
call the feeling of self-control of
self-possession. This sense of inner
self-possession is an extremely un
stable affair; it is often interfered
with.
In forming our opinions of our
selves we take into consideration
our relations with others. The self
of self-consciousness appears as
something which it could not be
were it not for others. How does
this self-consciousness get form and
why is it so varied ? It is in this
that our knowledge is so poor.
There is of course the loss of the
sense of personality as observed in
connection with falling asleep.
Then there is the feeling that there
is a foreign element within one's
self.
The earliest life of a child is lost
in obscurity. 1 lie first knowledge
we get "? the child's consciousness
I appear when it begins to imitate
other . From this time on up to
sevc < r * ij ht years of age the child
contii ucs u> imitate. When we
follow this imitation, one is struck
by the fart that the child leads two
lives- or.e exotic, while the other
iile is ill-' life in which he develops
his own self-consciousness. The
two lives mingle and cross in all
sorts of ways, but the child is not
just then as self-conscious as the
I child who draws with a pencil or
| makes a model out of paper. The
; former child would never come to
anything were it not for the imita
[ tion from others. And so he gets
I acquainted with the means of other
people. The child who uses scissors
| or pencil after you learns what it
1 is toeut or draw ; but lie gets these
by watching you repeatedly. I liese
! efforts of his to grasp your meaning
are thedelightsof his self-conscious
ness. Here he has two states of
! content, each fascinating; first, his
I observance of your deeds; second,
his own acts themselves and his de
light in them.
Whenever we have the emotions

of shame, love, anger, etc., we are
most self-conscious ; on the other
hand, shame intensifies our self
consciousness. Terror would make
one more self-conscious than shame,
but panic fear is a destroyer of self
consciousness.
Self-conscious functions are socia 1
functions; they involve some con
trast between ego and non-ego.
