# The 						Lutteman Sextette.
## 
### 
On Friday, Sept. 20, the Lutte
nian Male Sextette of Stockholm,
Sweden, will give an entertain
ment in the chapel under the aus
pices of the Mandolin Club. This
should be a great treat to the
music lovers of the University, as
this (.sextette has the reputation of
being one of the finest musical or
ganizations in the world. A com
paratively new club, they have
nevertheless scored a pronounced
success in the principal cities of
America and Europe. Their selec
tions range from the purely class
ical to the most familiar folk-songs
from Abt's "A Night in May" to
"Annie Laurie." With them
comes Madame Torbett, violinist,
a pupil of Camilioso, and an ar
tist of the rank of Musin or Item
enyi. Madame Torbett is a com
paratively new aquisition to pro
fessional ranks but she has already
given great promise by her sympa
thetic rendition of classical themes.
AI r. Rudolph von Scarpa, a Swed
ish pianist, is also a member of the
company.
The management has not yet
fixed the price of admission, but it
will he placed as low as the high
grade of the entertainment and the
heavy guarantee necessary to se
cure the sextette will justify.
