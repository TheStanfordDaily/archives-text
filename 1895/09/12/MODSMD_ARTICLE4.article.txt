# An Unfounded Report.
## 
### 
The San Francisco Call in an
article on the plans of the Reliance
team for the coming season, made
the statement that a game was to
take place Sept. 28 between the
Reliance team and Stanford's
eleven. Manager Eaton says that
there is no game scheduled for that
(hite and that the report, in that
particular, is erroneous.
