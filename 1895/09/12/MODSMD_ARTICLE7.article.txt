The efforts which certain stu
dents are making towards enlarg
ing the list of Stanford songs should
meet with early and pronounced
success. Almost every university
in the country, great or small, has
its quoto of college songs which add
very materially to the interest and
attractiveness of the institution.
Nothing is more inspiring or catch
ing than a college song, but hereto
fore in matters of this kind Stan
ford has been compelled to take a
back seat. Now however as we
grow older the old excuse of extreme
youth can no longer be advanced,
and for that reason we are glad to
see that some of the students ap
preciate the situation and are com
ing to the rescue.
The London Daily New.sof yester
day, according to cablegrams, said
in commenting upon the decision of
the yacht committee on the Defen
der's protest: "The committee's
severe award makes poor recipro
city for the generous treatment of
the Cornell crew at Henley."
In a sense there is some truth in
this statement. A certain amount
of official courtesy was shown the
American collegians, it is true.
But it was of a kind that could not
be withheld. Cornell was awarded
a decision in a case where the right
to it was so obvious that it could
not be denied. The curses of the
Leander coxswain, the abuse of the
English papers, and the hisses of
the spectators at the following race
can scarcely be considered court
eous. Reciprocity in such atten
tions would be rather distasteful to
the British yachtsmen. On the
whole, in spite of the fact that the
official decision was against Hun
raven, his reception has been in
marked contrast to that accorded
the Cornell crew at Henley.
