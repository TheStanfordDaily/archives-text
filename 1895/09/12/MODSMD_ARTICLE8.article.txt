The tennis season has once more
fairly commenced and a few of its
faithful supporters are putting forth
every effort to create an added in
terest in the game. Friday after
noon a meeting of the club will be
held to elect officers for the ensuing
semester and to determine upon a
course of action to be pursued dur
ing the coming season. It has al
ready been decided to repair the
old courts, buy new nets and balls,
and to put everything into first
class shape for the convenience of
the members. Many members are
now behind considerable amounts
in dues, and as the above changes
will involve a considerable outlay

of money it is hoped that they will
at once come forward and pay up,
especially when they learn that all
hack dues are to he discounted fifty
per cent. Some of California's hest
players belong to the cluh, and our
chances with Berkeley are very
bright for this year. Tennis is an
important branch of intercol
legiate athletics; as such it should
be fostered and a higher standard
of playing encouraged.
