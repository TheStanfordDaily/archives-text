# "THE FISHES OF SINALOA."
## The 						Latest of the Leland Stanford Junior University Publications. 
### 
The business office of the I'niver
sity has received a few of the first
copies of the latest of the series
called the "Leland Stanford Junior
I'niversity Publications." It is en
titled "The Fishes of Sinaloa" and
was prepared by Dr. Jordan, as
sisted by Edwin Chapin Starks,
George Bliss Culver, and Thomas
Marion Williams.
The title-page also bears the im
print, "Contributions to Biology
from the Hopkins Laboratory of
Biology —I." fhis is explained by
the following prefatory note signed
by the editors of the new series,
Prof. Charles 11. Gilbert and Prof.
Oliver P. Jenkins: "This memoir
is the first of a series designed to
illustrate the biological investiga
tions and explorations undertaken
by the Hopkins Biological Labora
tory, a branch of the Leland Stan
ford Junior I'niversity, under the
especial patronage of Tiniotby 1 lop
kins, Esq., of Menlo Park. Cali
fornia. The present paper is pub
lished with the co-operation of the
California Academy of Sciences. It
appears simultaneously in its pres
ent. form and as part of the proceed
ings of the Academy."
The work is well printed and
bound in a neat paper cover and
contains one hundred and forty
two pages and thirty plates. From
the introductory remarks preceding
the scientific descriptions the fol
lowing extract is made:
"The fishes of Sinaloa are known
chielly from the collections made
by Dr. Charles 11. Gilbert in the
winter of 1881. Under the auspices
of the U. S. Fish Commission, Mr.
Gilbert spent six weeks at Mazat
lan where he secured a collection of
about ISO species, of which number
about fifty were new to science.
These were described by Jordan
and Gilbert in the Proceedings of
the U. S. National Museum in
1881, the typical specimens being
deposited in the Museum at Wash
ington. Previous to this time a
number of specimens had been sent
by collectors who had visited
Mazatlan and Altata, to the Mu
seum at Vienna, where they were
described by Dr. Franz Steindach
ner, and to Berlin where they were
recorded by Prof. Peters.
"Subsequent to the visit of Dr.
Gilbert, collections were made at
Mazatlan and Presidio by Mr. Al
plionse Forrer, now of Santa Cruz,
California. Most of these were
sent to the I'. S. National Museum,
where they were described by the
present writer. A few specimens
were also sent to the British Mu
seum.
'■ I n December, 1894, through
the kindly interest of Mr. Timothy
Hopkins of Menlo Park, California,
ami under the auspices of the Hop
kins Seaside Laboratory, a branch
of the Leland Stanford Jr. Univer
sity, an expedition was sent to
Mazatlan for the purpose of collect
ing fishes. This was in charge of
David S. Jordan, assisted by George
B. Culver and Edwin C. Starks.
In addition, Mr. Thomas M. Will
iams, Mr. Norman B. Seofield, and
Mr. James A. Richardson accom
panied the expedition as volunteer

assistants, Frank H. Lamb as
botanist, and Mr. George B. Seward
as herpetoLgist.
One month, Dec. 24, 1894 to Jan.
2"), 1895, was spent at Mazatlan in
the collection of fishes. One hun
dred and eighty-five species were
obtained, of which twenty-nine
seem to be new to science, besides
two species from La Paz. A full
series of the specimens obtained is
in the Museum of behind Stanford
Jr. I'niversity. Other series nearly
complete have been sent to the
British Museum and to the Mu
seums at Vienna and Berlin. Par
tial sets are in the Academy of
Sciences at San Francisco and in
the U. S. National Museum. It is
evident that the list here given is
by no means a complete record of
the tishes of Sinaloa. Doubtless
all the species enumerated from
Sonora by Gilbert, Jenkins, and
Evermann, and by Gilbert and
others from Lower California, will
ultimately lie found in this region.
Every day spent at Mazatlan either
by Dr. Gilbert or l>v ourselves
brought some addition to the list,
and the deep water lishes have not
been studied at all."
The thirty plates are reproduced
from drawings made by Miss Anna
L. Brown, the artist of the Hopkins
Laboratory.
Copies may be obtained by ad
dressing the Registrar, Stanford
University, California. Price, fifty
cents.
