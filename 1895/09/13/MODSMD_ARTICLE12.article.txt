The registration <>f new students
from the East still continues with
out diminution. This fact is sig
nificant in more ways that one. It
was at lirst supposed that as
soon as the direct influence of the
professors coming from the eastern
states had been removed by
two or three years residence here

the large registration of eastern
students would in a great measure
cease. This year's registration, if
not in excess, is at least up to the
standard, and this, in the face of the
quasi-hostile attitude of many
papers both East and West, indi
cates a linn belief in the future of
Stanford University by the people
at large. Many, however, who
would have desired to send their
sons here have had only the east
ern journals as a source of infor
mation. When tlie future of the
University is once beyond question,
when litigation has ended, and
there is no longer even the slightest
foundation for injurious rumors, we
may expect to see the quadrangle
crowded with one of the most cos
mopolitan of all student bodies in
America.
