As a means of bringing out men
and arousing the proper enthusiasm
for football the idea of inter-class
matches is an excellent one. Each
season thus far there lias been an
apparent apathy for the game, so
that it has often been a question as
the Thanksgiving game approached
whether our men had been given
sufficient team work. It has been
late in the season before two full
elevens could be brought against
each other in regular practice
games. From indications this
season, there will be no lack of
candidates for first and second
elevens, but to call out the best
material a schedule of the class
games should be set so that there
! would be no interference with big
matches; and all should be brought
off long enough in advance of the
j intercollegiate game that the prep
aration for it maybe helped and
j not retarded.
Incidentally, inter-class games
are a great help to the financial
side of football. If students who
are slow in paying in their student
! body assessment could be assured
that they are to get an immediate
i return in theentertainnient afforded
by a series of such games the col
lections could be made much more
easily. And nothing is more urgent
than that those assessments be col
! lected.
