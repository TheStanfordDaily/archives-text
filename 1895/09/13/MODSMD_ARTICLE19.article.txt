About fifteen men turned out for
football practice last night. The
majority of these were new men.
Some of the old men evidently
think preliminary practice un
necessary. In some cases our
former heroes are prevented from
pract ice by studies and other duties,
but it should nevertheless be borne
in mind that Capt. Cochran needs
help in coaching and encouraging
the inexperienced players. The
showing thus far is rather favor
able, but there is still need for can
didates for the several teams. As
the veteran. Cant Hardly, says,
Our chief need is for good full
backs, halfbacks, quarterbacks,
ends, tackles, guards, and centers."
Every able-bodied freshman, ex
perienced or inexperienced, should
remember that he has a chance of
making one of three teams â€” the
Varsity, Second Eleven, or Fresh
man team. The privilege of repre
senting his college in the Stanford
1. C. Freshman match should be
an athletic honor second only to
the glory of playing in the " big
game."
Yesterday's practice consisted of
punting fora half hour, on the
oval, under the coaching of Capt.
Cochran, and work in the gym
nasium fora similar period under
Trainer H ether ington'ssupervision.
In the gymnasium the candi
dates are divided into two squads.
These divisions alternate at the
weights and diving on the mats.
Hereafter, on Monday, Wednes
day, and Friday the men will put
in their time in punting and cross
country runs.
On Tuesday, Thursday, and Satur
day, gymnasium work will take the
place of the running.
