The following article by Dr. Jor
dan was contributed to the recent
fraternity number of the Berkeley
Herald:
u Most college men look back to
certain personal associations as the
most enjoyable recollections of the
college. The 'fellow feeling among
free spirits'has in it a charm not
excelled by any other pleasure as
sociated with intellectual develop
ment. The value of this pleasure
is attested by its existence.
u The fraternity is an arrange
ment for intensifying anu preserv
ing these feelings. One cannot be
intimate with all his fellows. A
specialized fellowship with the few
is worth more than vague comrad
ship with the many. Therefore,
those who most enjoy one another
are drawn together. '.ledem das
seine, am besten gefallt.' And the
friendships thus intensified in col-/
lege are likely to be life-long.

k< All this is the good side of the
fraternity system, and very good it
is. The had side may exist also,
part of it lying in the exclusiveness
of close organization, part of it in
the weakness ol' human nature.
" To attach one's self closely to one
group of people is in like manner
to cut one's self off from the good
influence of other groups. There
fore, one should not be in haste to
he enrolled in one fraternity until
he knows that no other will he
more congenial to him. For like
reason one should not he in haste
to marry in fear 'that girls will he
scarce in the spring.'
" The secrecy of the fraternities
is a childish survival of old cus
toms. The use of fraternities in
'college politics ' is disgusting and
degrading. Where the men in a
fraternity are had in their aggre
gate, had influence becomes ii tensi
tied. Birds of a feather have tiv.ir
own ways of flocking, ai:<i, accord
ing to the German proverh, even
the birds that fly highest cannot
get away from their tails. Nor, as
it happens, from their hills either.
A good many college men have
been ruined by entering a society
of highfliers, spendthrifts, and pro
fligates. But as it happens, this
condition is not confined to college
circles. The invertebrate hoy is in
danger everywhere. Sooner or
Inter the man without a purpose of
his own is cut down by the fates.
" But with all this, the good man
must have good fellowship. Good
fellowship is promoted by a good
fraternity. For one, I have never
regretted that my college life was
made stronger and its memories
sweeter by my fraternitv relations."
