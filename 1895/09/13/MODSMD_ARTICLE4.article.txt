Following the example of many
others, 1). C. Brewer, '97, also took
a trip to Yoseinite during the sum
mer. He went from Stockton via
! Knight's Ferry and through the
| placer mining district of Big Oak
i Flat, entering the valley via Eagle
: Peak Trail, climbed Eagle Peak,
I Cloud's I vest, Mt. Watkins, ami
! Glacier Point, and passed through
i some canyons not generally fre
quented hy tourists, among these
being Tenaya Canyon as far as the
cascades and Too-1001-a-we-ack
j Canyon to the foot of Allilouette
| Fall.
On July 4, in company with
A. Cheek and C. S. Brooks, both of
j Oakland, he started for Mt. Lyell
via Lake Tenaya. This side trip
I took him several miles through the
j Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne
i lliver, passing the bases of Mt.
Hoffman, Mt. Dana, and Mt. Gibbs.
In ascending Mt. Lyell the party
camped four nights in the snow.
The higher peak was climbed by
j moonlight because of the softness
! of the snow during the day. The
I party arrived on the top just at
I daybreak and were rewarded by
witnessing one of the grandest of
sunrises. The party returned via
Cathedral Spires and the canyon
of the Upper Merced.
Mr. Brewer in leaving the valley
returned via Wawona and Mari
posa big trees and through the
mining district of Mariposa and
Coultervilie. He was obliged to
lay over in camp fora few days at
the foot of Clowchilla Mountain on
account of the poisonous effects of
j a rattlesnake bite.
Prof. W. R. Dudley spent nearly
{the whole vacation in the moun
j tains of California, and has added
i several thousand specimens to the
j herbarium.
The last week in May he collected
| around Madrone Springs and south
of Mt. Hamilton. One week early
in June was spent camping and
collecting among the redwoods of
Pescadero creek and the Big Basin.
On June 20 he went south to Ante
lope Canyon, a beautiful spot in the
Tehachapi Mountains, between six
| and eight thousand feet above sea,
1 level. This canyon, although mid
way between two arid plains, the
j San Juan and Mojave, is abund
|ai:i v >upplied with water, and
jconiie rous forest trees,
i Eariy m June he entered the
| southern Sierras above Glenville,
j about, iiity miles northeast of Bak
erstield. The time until Aug. 20
was spent upon the unfrequented
trail of the great Western Divide
of the Sierras, between the Kern
river and the westward flowing
White, Tule, and Kaweah rivers.
He made it a point to visit most of
the groves of the Sequoia (fifja-nfea
| as far north as the Giant Forest in
jtlie Sequoia National Park. The
head of the Kern river was visited
| twice, and the Western Divide
i crossed several times. The highest
elevation reached was at Farewell
Gap above Mineral King, and at
the head of the Marble Fork of the
Kaweah, in the vicinity of ihe
j Kaweah Peaks. These points were
above timber line. Most of the
time, however, was spent in the
timbered belt between six and
seven thousand feet above sea level.

The Cerent Sequoia National Park
was visited several times. The
protection afforded by the govern
ment to this forest by means of
cavalry patrol is thoroughly effec
tive. Frank Lamb.|'9B, accompan
