# Back From Springfield.

Prof. J. P. Smith has just re
turned from his duties as secretary
of the combined meeting of the
Geological Society of America and
the American Association for the
Advancement of Science. The
meeting, which was largely at
tended by leading educators from
all over the United States, was
held at Springfield, \lass. Ten days
were occupied in the reading of
papers, discussions, and recitals of
excursions taken to many points of
interest. Among the papers read
were one by Prof. Smith, entitled
"Supplementary Notes on the
Metamorphic Series of Shasta
County, California," and a paper
by Dr. Branner on the " Decomposi
tion of the Hocks of Brazil." Dr.
Gill, who was here in '94 and who
is now a professor at Cornell, also
presented a paper. Dr. Palache of
the University of California was in
attendance. Prof. Davis of Har
vard, Prof. Emerson of Amherst,
and Prof. Williams of Yale took
part in the proceedings of the
Congress and added much to its
success. The officers elected for the
ensuing year are as follows : Presi
dent, Prof. Cope of Philadelphia ;
vice-president, Prof. Emerson of
Amherst; secretary, Dr. (iill of
Cornell.
This meeting at Springfield was
an extremely prosperous one, and
the one to be held next year at
Buffalo, X. Y., has a very promis
ing outlook. Quite a little
disappointment was expressed that
the meeting was not held in Cali
fornia, as had been planned. The
people of California, however, may
expect to see it held here two or
three vears hence.
