# THE
						CARDINAL AT THE MECHANICS' FAIR.
## A
						Small But Enthusiastic Stanford Crowd on the Closing Night. 
### 
Other attractions interfered
largely with the Stanford evening
at the Mechanics' Fair as far as
nunihers was concerned. The re
ception at home to new students,
the distance from the city, and .John
Drew's last night proved too much
for all hut about fifty students.
Hut these made up in enthusiasm
what was lacking in numbers.
Before the program of music be
gan. the yell was given at the en
trance a nuinher of times and then
at intervals in various parts of the
building.
Kaufman's familiar) ligure loom
ing up, baton in hand, in front of
Seheel's Band soon caused tlum to
gather about the music stand.
Those numbers of the program
which were Stanford compositions
were directed by Kaufman. The
Stanford University March" was
the first number, and later on was
repeated by request. The "Junior,"
"Sophomore," and "Freshman"
marches, all by Kaufman, elicited
much applause. " Roble Hall
Sehottische," composed by Miss
Aiice W heeler, '1)7, was also warmly
received.
llerr Scheel afterwards expressed
it as his opinion that Kaufman is
possessed in a high degree of the
musical genius, and predicted a
bright future for him. He also ex
pressed his approval of Miss
Wheeler's sehottische as being well
arranged and pretty and having a
certain swing to it, characteristic
of a typical college girl's composi
t ion.
The "Sigma Nil March," written
by Sauvelet of San Francisco, was
another number that won the ap
plause of Stanford men.
Throughout the evening the per
formers at the pianos exhibited by
the different dealers played Stan
ford music.
One of the most laughable events
of the evening was the labelling of
the Boraxaid donkey with a large
"98" by some enterprising fresh
man. The label was soon changed
to "99," and subsequently under
went several changes.
The manager expressed his satis
faction with the success of the
evening and the gentlemanly con
duct of the college hoys. About
1 ">000 were present, due partly to
the fact that it was the last night,
but still more to sympathy for
Stanford, as shown by the lavish
nesswith which our color was shown
in flowers and ribbons. More than
half of those present wore the
ca rdidal.
