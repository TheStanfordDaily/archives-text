# Football Practice.

### 
About as many men came for
ward for football practice on Fri
day and Saturday evenings as
usual. The work was of the regu
lar routine order, punting, running,
and gymnasium work.
Capt. Cochran complains that
the old men show so little interest
in the work. The new men need
encouragement and can best be in
spired with the proper zeal through
the examples set them by older
players, but one or two men are
not able to train fifteen or twenty.
There appears to be a good deal
<>112 promising material in the ('lass
of ? V)9. Some of the men are large
and well built but show a tendency
to try for positions in which there
is no particular need for men.
Kvidently our weakest point is to
be the position of fullback and
there seems to be no particular
candidate for that place as yet.
