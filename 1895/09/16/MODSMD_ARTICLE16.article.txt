# A 						New Laboratory.
## 
### 
The Electrical Engineering
building has been remodeled.
Professor Perrine's old office has
been changed and turned into a
laboratory for advanced students.
There is no jolting by the motion
of machinery in this apartment, as
all the tables are made upon piles
driven in the ground and not con
nected in any way with other parts
of the building.
