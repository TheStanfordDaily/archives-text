# A 						New Specimen.
## 
### 
The type specimen of Verillea
lilakei (Stearns) from British
Columbia, has arrived at the Uni
versity. It is a curious looking ob
ject, consisting of a coral stem
about three feet long, and having
the individual animals scattered
along its sides.
As it is the type specimen it has
unusual value ; it is the one from
which the species has received its
name. It was presented to the
University by Prof. Davidson of
the United States Geodetic Survey.
