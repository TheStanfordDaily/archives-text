# Trips in the Northwest.

### 
During the last vacation Will
Lewis, 'IJB, made quite an extended
trip from Spokane, Wash., to the
boundary of Montana, lie left
Spokane on July 3, in company
with three others, for the Coeur
d'Alene district, where be arrived
on the 6th of the same month.
After visiting the military encamp
ment fora few days, they pitched
their camp on Mosquito bay, a
large befiutiful bay of the Coeur
d'Alene lake. They fished here for
about six days. The largest catch
made by any of the party was one
of a hundred and twenty-five trout
made by Lewis on June 9. They
went from here to Hiu-Scukum
creek; which means in the Indian
language, ''very good creek." This
creek is a branch of the St. Marys
and is noted for line fishing and
hunting. After camping here fora
week they visited the mines of the
Coeur d'Alene, climbed to the sum
mit of their bills, and then struck
across, with pack horses, for the
Mig Joe. This place marks the
battle ground of the Coeur d'Alencs
and Spokanes where Chief Joseph

won his leadership of the latter
tribe.
The place naturally had a his
toric interest to the boys and they
made some valuable collections of
arrow and spear heads. The coun
try for miles on each side of the
river was covered with dense under
growth, in which the forest fires
played such havoc that the boys
came very near having to leave all
their outfit and relics behind them
in order to escape the tlames. By
great exertions, however, they made
their way to the Mission and from
there to Spokane, after having been
gone a little over a month.
F. 1). Allen, r 9B, left Spokane on
July 11, for the Okanagon river.
Me had but one companion and
they travelled the entire distance
on horseback. They arrived at
their destination on Juiv 17 and
pitched their camp near some of
the prominent mines. Mr. Allen
says that the mines are running in
an indifferent sort of a way and are
not, as a consequence, doing much.
From here they moved upon the
mountains and camped upon one
of the many grassy draws on the
side of the mountain. Fora week
they hunted among the peaks and
crags, when a mis-step in some
places would mean certain death.
They saw several mountain goats
but were unable to approach near
enough to shoot one. Seven deer
and a bear were killed during the
trip.
Mr. Allen next went to lake
Okanagan where he spent a few
days, and then set out for home,
going by way of Sprague. where the
great lire had laid most of the city
in ashes.
