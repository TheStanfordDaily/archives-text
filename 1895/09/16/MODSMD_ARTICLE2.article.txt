# "Immortality."

The Sunday sermon was de
livered hy Prof, (iriggs. on the sub
ject " Immortality." The follow
ing is a hrief extract :
1 'he fabric of our knowledge rests
upon a hasis that is deeper than
itself, upon faith — faith, which is
deeper than science and cannot he
proved, hut of which every act of
our lives is an affirmation. The
planter expresses his faith in the
orderly recurrence of the seasons,
in the coming of ihe sunshine and
rain, in the existence in the seed of
the mysterious principle of life.

The scientist investigating the!
material world aflirnis by his every
act his faith in the unity of law,
that the new fact he discovers will
he in harmony with the laws that i
rule all nature. Yet he cannot|
prove this. So, in all our lives,!
each deed is an affirmation of ourj
whole faith in the nature of the j
universe and our relation to it ;
and every deed is molded in a
measure by our faith.
Of this faith there are three!
principal elements: faith in the t
rationality and unity of the uni
verse, or faith in Ood ; faith in the j
power of man to fulfill the ends of!
his being, or faith in practical]
freedom ; faith in the existence of j
something permanent in the uni
verse to give meaning to the process !
»>f change, or faith in immortality, i
The problem of immortality is j
one'to which we are compelled to I
turn again and again ; the central :
question on which hinges all else
in human life, the practical iin-1
portance of which sufficiently re
futes those who say that faith has:
no importance for actual life.
What we crave is the same moral
certainty of tlie eternity of in-1
dividual life that we have that the!
sun will rise tomorrow. There is a
priori certainty that the sun will
rise tomorrow, or that there will
be a tomorrow; we cannot establish
these facts on metaphysicai grounds; J
yet we go quietly to sleep, secure!
in the faith that tomorrow a ;
new sunshine will bless a new day. l
Such a faith do we need as a basis]
for our lives —faith in the sanity j
of the universe, and the rational 1
meaning of life; and upon the:
plane of our reason the one thing
that can give life such a meaning
is the eternity of individual life.
Something besides change is!
eternal, else to our reason the:
universe is meaningless. No dura-,
tion less than eternal can satisfy j
our love and reason; if life were!
to last a million years only to end ;
in nothing, the blind horror would
haunt us in every moment of]
earnest thought. Without the j
eternity of something besides
change life would indeed be a 1
hideous farce, and there would be
no rational basis for morals,or real!
motive for living well. Neither
kindly utilitarianism nor frank
pleasure-seeking Hedonism can
cheat us into imagining that life!
has a meaning or that there is any
stronger reason for virtue than for
life, if nothing is eternal but !
eh a nge.
Yet only the narrow mind be
lieves life to be a farce ; he who!
lives by the labor of his hands,and :
stands in close relation to nature, is
rarely a pessimist. The philosophy ;
of despair may answer the worn-out
nerves and dissipated lives of
diseased civilization, but every I
strong, well life will react against
it with immense force.
In this inevitable reaction lies
our chief hope. That the universe
is sound is the verdict of nearly all
mankind, and the few who deny
t his <l«i sii beeause they hold t lie are
to be meaningless when they cannot
sec the perfect circle.
In all nature the relatively tran
sitory gets its meaning in the rela-i
tively permanent, but the relatively]
permanent can only have, for

human reason, a meaning in the
Everlasting. If organized life
comes to an end, and the earth
falls hack into the sun, with no end
in any thing permanent, then the
whole process loses the meaning
which the part seemed to have, and
the cycle <>i' change from the nebula
to the dead world is to human
reason and love like the hideous
jest of an insane mind. But faith
says that the clear tendencies of
the part must, somehow, he fulfilled
in the whole; that all change gets
its meaning in an Everlasting —
and upon this faith (not know
ledge) must he huilt the structure
of our lives.
Now what, and how, can any
thing he permanent? Let us peer
first into human life for an answer.
What meaning is there in the
ceaseless succession of experiences
in the growth from child to man?
Hardly a single one of those exper
iences would we now reverse, and
why? Not because mistakes made
us happy and sorrows were a pleas
ure, but because with mistakes and
suffering has come larger develop
ment of life. The long process of
change has meaning through the
evolution of the relatively per
manent character.
This is one among many ex
amples which seem to prove the
permanent to lie in the moral, and
not the material world; time and
change get their meaning only
through the growth through them
of the soul that is eternal.
There is but one answer that
satisfies at once the cravings of our
hearts and minds. We dare not
affirm it dogmatically; for the
truth in the universe may be infin
itely higher than anything we can
now conceive. This answer, which
alone completes the tendencies re
vealed in nature and human life,
which makes the world rational,
satisfies the cravings of human love
and reason, and gives a meaning to
every fact of human experience,
can, on ihr plane of our renxon, be
found in the eternity of the individ
ual soul.
The existence of the universal
craving for life is itself an argu
ment for the eternity of the indi
vidual: for this craving is an
inevitable result of the conscious
ness of j ossiblities which can only
he rtaiizM: in infinite progress.
The iiici-mpleteness with which
the laws of life work out their re
sults in this world impels us to
the same faith. We are able to see
tendencies, but seldom are they
Itillilhd; not often does ambition
realize the tragedy of a Macbeth;
rarely are the five acts of the drama
of life completed before the curtain
falls.
So we believe that somehow and
somewhere the broken arcs must be
made a full circle, and the unful
filled tendencies carried out to a
Una 1 com] »let ion.
The final basis for our faith lies
in the fact that we can, and do now,
live the everlasting life. All moral
action, thought, love, belong in the
moral or immaterial world, and ex
periences of this kind are proof of
the permanence of the higher hu
man life. When we will our best,
and so feel our harmony with the
whole spiritual universe, when we
are in the presence of some great

thought, when we are uplifted by
some transcendant love, tiien do
we realize our immortality: we are
part of the eternal world; for we
are conscious that we are in the
presence of realities which are in
dependent of the physical, and
belong in the life everlasting.
