### 
The reception given Saturday
evening by the University Chris
tian Association for the benefit of
new students was in every way a
success. It was, as it should be,
informal in character. There were
no especial social features, us these
receptions are given with a view of
get ting the new students acquainted.
Toward the close of theevening Dr.
.Jordan gave an address of welcome
in his usual happy vein. He began
by relating some of bis own fresh
man experiences. Continuing, be
touched upon the difference between
the present idea in higher educa
tion and the notions that prevailed
in bis own day. He then spoke of
the elective system as it prevails
at Stanford, and outlined the ad
vantages claimed for it over other
systems. In conclusion, he ex
tended a hearty welcome to the
new students.
Schubert's Orchestra rendered a
number of selections during the
evening, and light refreshments
were served. The entertainment
was not in the hands of any es
pecial committee, but was managed
bv several volunteers from the As
sociation, and each member was a
committee of one for the welcoming
of new students. Special credit is
due. to the young ladies of Roble
who arranged the tasteful decora
tions.
