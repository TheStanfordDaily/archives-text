One encouraging sign of the
growth of our students in worldly
wisdom is the decrease in the num
ber of petitions for long hours.
Fifteen hours are about all that an
average student can carry and do
himself and his studies justice;
eighteen is the limit of average
ability. More than eighteen hours
few can carry and do the work with
any approach to thoroughness. A
fifteen-hour course conscientiously
carried is, in this age of specializa
tion, far more profitable than one
of twenty, twenty-two, or twenty
four hours taken with a view to
credits, and barely passed bymeans
of " cramming." .
