Thk new idea of singing the Col
lege hymn," Hail, Stanford, Hail,"
as a gathering song at the Sunday
morning services at the chapel, was
put into practice for the first time
yesterday. The result was de
cidedly dismal. Only a few
scattered voices were to be heard,
in marked contrast to the volume
of sound which swelled forth when
the next hymn was begun.
This lack of enthusiasm was
doubtless due more to unfamiliarity
with the words and music of the
hymn than to any disinclination to
join iÂ») its singing, and is in itself
the best proof of the need of such
practice.
Stanford is young and poor in
traditions, in songs, and in many
things that enter into the fulness
of the life of older institutions.
Many of these elements can come
with time alone, but others will
never be produced by mere growth
n age. If Stanford songs are
never written, or if written are
neglected and forgotten, one hun
dred years from now the University
will be as poor in songs as at the
present. We have now a college
hymn whose words are a gem of
poetry and whose music is true
music. Well sung it arouses the
emotions of the most prosaic, awak
ening love and loyalty for Stan
ford in the breast of the most com
nonplace individual of us all. Yet
few know either the words or the
music, and scarcely any groups
can be found to sing it with proper
feeling and power. Only by some
device for causing it to be sung can
it acquire the popularity that its
merit deserves. The chapel idea

should not be dropped. The at
tenipt may he discouraging fora
time hut it will soon bring ahout
the desired end.
