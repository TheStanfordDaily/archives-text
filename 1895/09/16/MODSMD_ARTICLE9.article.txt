The difficulty between the two
yachts, coming as it does so close
upon the Henley fiasco, has given a
most unfortunate turn to inter
national athletic affairs. From the
time when Harvard and Oxford
met in rowing, back in the sixties,
contests between the two great
Anglo-Saxon nations have been re
markable for good feeling. Never,
until the present summer, have
lovers of amateur sport <>n either
side of the water had any cause to
complain of unfair or discourteous
treatment in an international con
test. This summer, just when
athletics seemed to be in so flour
ishing a condition, our athletic re
lations have been marred by these
two unfortunate squabbles.
It is of no use to fight out on
paper the discussions growing out
of the Henley affair and the yacht
race. Doubtless there is much to
be said on both sides, and both
parties are, from their different
standpoints, probably right. It is
our business to look into the future.
In a few weeks the Cambridge
track team, the second English
varsity team that ever visited this
country, will meet Yale in New
Haven. It is Yale's opportunity
to vindicate both American sport
and American courtesy. The sym
pathies of Americans must be all
with Yale, but defeat will be much
preferable to victory of the justness
of which Englishmen may com
plain. If Yale wins let her win
fairly and in a manner to reflect
credit not only upon her athletic
ability but upon her courtesy and
fairness. The future of Anglo-
American athletics is in the hands
of the wearers of the blue.
