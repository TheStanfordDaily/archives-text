# Woman's Athletic Association.

### 
This organization is about to
enter on the third year of its career
as a recognized society of the Uni
versity. Il passed safely through
the trying stage of infancy; by the
second year it had a fairly good
start in life, and tlie great success
of last year's work shows that it
lias back of it a strong and vigor
ous constitution.
The work of organizing into clubs
devoted to special branches of ath
letics having been accomplished in
the first year, the members could
devote themselves entirely to the
athletic work for which the associ
ation was formed. It was found
that the activity and importance of
the clubs might change from time
to time as circumstances and the
interests of the members changed.
A club that was very popular one
year might easily lose favor the
next year only to be taken up again
latter and pushed once more into
prominence.
One of the most flourishing of
last year's clubs was the Tennis
Club. Through its efforts the hold
ing of a tournament was realized
for the first time in the history of
•.he University. A classification
tournament was held the latter
part of the first semester with
twelve entries. Upon the results
of that tournament was based the
continuous tournament of the
second semester. Miss Anna Mar
tin, .Miss Ida Williams, Miss Web
ster, and Miss Hose held first places
during the year. In May, a Uni
versity tournament was held. As
a result of that game, Miss Anna
Martin holds the championship for
ladies' singles. Some good work is
expected tor this year from Miss
Webster. She showed up well
against Miss Martin in the last
tournament and has already begun
practicing for ibis year. There are
several good players among the new
students, and altogether the out
look is bright for another prosper
ous tennis year.
Systematic playing can only be
obtained through the club. Mem
bers have thy exclusive use of oneof
the Koble courts a - well as common
right to the other courts, so that
there is always a chance for prac
tice. Nets and balls are also
furnished by the association.
The interest taken in the Archery
Club has been such as to warrant
the laying out of a range and the
putting up of a back-stop. While
bows and arrows are furnished by
the association, the members gen
erally become so enthusiastic that
they prefer to own their own bows.
The club has been very fortunate
in having the assistance of Profes
sors Abbott and A Hard ice. They
are both honorary members and
practice with the club. Through
the kindness of Mrs. Havens, the
club has been invited to Hose Crest
Hange. Mrs. Havens has one of
the finest archery ranges on the
Coast and the club members antici
pate a delightful visit some time in
the near future.
With the athletic woman who
likes a good active game in which
all the muscles are brought into
play, basket-ball will always hold
its own. The early and severe
n»jn*i of last winter prevented much
practicing, so that the team was

unable to plav many full games.
A challenge was sent to the »San
•lose Normal School, hut the game
had been' fixed for so late in the
term that the Normal School found
it impossible to play. One match
game was played with the
V. W. 0, A. team from San Fran
cisco. It was an easy victory for
Stanford.
It is the intention of the club
to get to work earlier this year if
possible and to make arrangements
for more match games. Miss
Head's and Miss West's schools at
Berkeley and San Francisco have
good basket-ball teams, and doubt
less some good games can be gotten
up with them.
The Bicycle Club boasts the
largest membership of any club in
the association, and needs no effort
on the part of the Board of Direct
ors to make il a success. It is reg
ularly organized and under the
direction of tlie'captainand lieuten
ant many delightful runs have
been made. Frequent short runs
are made during the week ; longer
runs are arranged for at stated
times.
A Pedestrian Club will soon be
formed for those who enjoy tramp
ing. Such a club ought to become
very popular here, where the moun
tains are so close at hand.
The management of the associa
tion is vested in a Board of Direct
ors in which each class has its rep
resentative. The control of the
clubs is in the hands of committees
appointed by the Board and re
sponsible to the Board. All neces
sary appropriations for each club
are made by the Board from the
general fund.
In the words of the preamble to
the constitution, "All women pur
suing any line of study in the Uni
versity are eligible to membership."
The dues are twenty-live cents a
semester 'and no assessments are
allowed.
