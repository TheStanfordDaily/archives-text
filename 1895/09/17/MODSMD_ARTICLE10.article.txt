Interest in class affairs must be
very strong indeed when two dif
ferent classes in the University
cannot find more than one person
out of their number to nominate
for the highest offices in their gift.
The Freshman Class has shown
its good sense by the election of a
football manager so early in the
season. The annual contest with
the Berkeley freshmen is one sec
ond only in importance to that of
Thanksgiving Day, and should by
no means be surrendered without a
hard struggle. Now let the candi
dates organize and commence
practice.
It will lie seen by the extracts
from the annual report of the
Librarian for last year, published
on the first page, that for that
period, as before, Mr. Timothy Hop
kins was the Library's chief bene
factor. Mr. Hopkins has long
since by his generous contributions
and endowments, and by his deep
interest in everything that pertains
to the University's welfare, won a
place in our affections second only
to that of the founders.
