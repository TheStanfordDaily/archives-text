The number of candidates who
reported for admission to the (ilee
Club yesterday afternoon augurs
well for the future success of the
organization. Yet, notwithstanding
all this, there are a number of dif
ficult positions to till, and the Club
needs the assistance of every stu
dent who thinks himself qualified
for one of those positions. Of last
year's (<lee Club only six members
are now in College, and among their
number not a iirst tenor is to be
found. This position is an exceed
ingly difficult place to fill and the
management hopes that every stu
dent who has any qualifications at
all for the position will be present
at the trial of voices in the chapel
on Wednesday afternoon at four
o'clock. Prosperity can be obtained
only through individual effort, and
with success comes the prospect of
an extended trip during the holi
days.
