In another column is published
a Berkeley item, concerning the
case of one of her most prominent
athletes. During the trip with the
U. C. team East, he failed to keep
some of thestrictest rules laid down
for the athlete to follow; his
punishment has followed.
The names of the committee
members who administered the
reprimand prove that the derelic
tionsof the athlete were not trifling.
To an outside public it may seem
unreasonably severe, but such is
not the case. Discipline is as
necessary among athletes as among
soldiers, and when they are selected
to represent their institution in
great field events, they are no
longer their own masters — they
stand for the student body. Fail
in the events they may, that can
be excused; but failure in their
duty to their college cannot be con
doned. By its act this Berkeley
committee has shown itself in favor
of true, manly sport. It has placed
itself on record as expecting con
scientious work from its athletes,
and has made such an example as
it will, in all probability, never
need to make again.
