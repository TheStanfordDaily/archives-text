This morning's Call in its cor
respondence from Berkeley says:
W. C. Patterson of the university

track team has brought himself into
dire disgrace in the eyes of the
athletic executive committee of the
university by having broken bis
training pledge while on the East
ern tour with the U. C. track team
last spring. Patterson, it will be
remembered, was the high jumper
of the team, and from the records
be had made while at college as a
crack man in bis line great things
were expected of him on the East
ern tracks. But on account of the
violations of the first principles of
established training rules he totally
disqualified himself from competing
after the first few games.
The first trouble arose at Phila
delphia, when he was seen by
several of the team smoking and
was subsequently accused of drink
ing, and as a conseqiu nee he was
given his ticket to Caliiomia before
half the contests for which the
team was listed had been entered.
Since the opening of this term at
the university the matter has been
kept very quiet, but at a meeting of
the athletic executive committee last
Friday the following resolution
was unanimously passed:
"Whereas, \V. 0. Patterson
has been proved to have broken the
training pledge signed by the mem
bers of the Eastern athletic team of
1895,
"Resolved, That he is hereby ex
pelled from the Athletic Associa
tion of the University of California,
and is debarred from competing in
any future athletic contests under
the colors of the University of Cali
fornia."
The executive committee consists
of Professor Edward B. Clapp,
Harry H. Hirst, '96, Bernard P.
Miller, ' ( .)7, Fred W. Koch,
Robert T. Chestnut, '97, M. Dozier,
'98, C. A. Son, '97, and H. 11. Lang,
