up before the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals. .Judges Gilbert
of Oregon, Hawley of Nevada, and
Morrow of San Francisco presided.
The claim is for $15,287,000, the
proportion of the entire indebted
ness of $60,000,000, based upon
belaud Stanford's proportionate
ownership of the stock of the
Central and the Western t Pacific
Railroad (Companies.
Judge L. 1). McKisick, who is
the chief attorney for the Govern
ment, is delivering a long argu
ment, reviewing the facts of the
case from the very beginning. His
argument tills a 200-page printed
book. It will require perhaps three
days for the appellant's attorney to
complete his argument. In his
work he is assisted by United States
District Attorney Foote.
When the United States has had
its side fully argued, Judge Garber,
leading attorney for Mrs. Stanford,
will begin his argument for the
respondent. Russell Wilson is as
sociated with Judge Garber in the
interests of Mrs. Stanford.
