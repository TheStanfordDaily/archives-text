Last night's practice differed, in
jno essential feature, from that of
the preceding days. There were a
I few more old men out than usual,
j but not as many as there should
! have been.
All candidates for the Freshman
team are expected to be on hand
tonight. It is necessary that they
should be, for last year's defeat in
the Freshman game should be taken
as a warning. As a matter of
I course, the new men are green and
! cannot receive too much training,
j If the '98 eleven had had the ad
; vantage of any team work, the story
iof the tirst Stanford-U. C. Fresh
man game might have been differ
ent.
