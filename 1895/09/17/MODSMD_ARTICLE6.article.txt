# Now Football Rules.

### 
'I he new rules were issued yester
day. Ihere are several material
changes. There will be three sets
of nuts in operation this year —the
compromise rules of 18 ( Jo, the Yale-
Princeton modifications, and those
of the 1 larvard-Pennsylvania-Cor
nell combination.
The most important changes are
found in rules 8, 14, 22. 24, and
80.
In rule 8, which has reference to
a fair catch, there is no change un
der the Yale-Prineton rules.
As amended by 1 la rvard-Pennsyl
vania-Cornell, the catcher need not
indicate his intention of making a
fair catch. He cannot run with
the ball but may pass it to one of
his own'side who may kick it or
run with it ; otherwise it must be

put in play where the fair catch,
was made.
Kule 14, under the Yale-Prince-;
ton amendment calls for an assist- 1
ant linesman in addition to the
other three officials. The captain
can appeal only to the umpire.
The Harvard-Pennsylvania—Cor
nell amendment adds a second um
pire in place of a second lines
man. A committee is also called'
with power to disqualify a player
for any length of time.
Yale and Princeton add this to
rule 20, regarding the kick-off: "It
either side shall forfeit the ball
twice without its going into the
field of play, il shall go down as a'
first down at the center of the field, 1
to the opponents."
Rule 22 is substituted by Yale-
Princeton as follows: "Alter a
fair catch the ball may be put in
play by a player of the side having
made the catch. It may be put in
play by a free kick or scrimmage,
the point of scrimmage to be the
catcher's mark. If by a free kick,
the opponents may not advance be
yond the catcher's mark, and the
ball must be kicked from some
point behind that mark on a par
allel with the touch-line."
In a substitute for rule 30, sec.
C, Yale-Princeton attempts to do
away with*mass plays by not al
lowing more than one man to start
forward, nor more than three men
to mass behind the line, before the
ball is in play, and by compelling
seven men to be in line until the
ball is in play.
