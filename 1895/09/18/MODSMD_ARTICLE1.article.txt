"The American Idea of Equality."!
Prof. Sidney Mezes, of the i
chair of philosophy in the Univer
sity of Texas, delivered the lec
ture in the chapel last evening. Hej
spoke as follows:.
Friends are nf two kinds: real
friends and show friends. Real
friends enumerating our virtues
tell us of our faults; show friends;
do not. ileal friends are thus often
mistaken for enemies. The greatest
part of a man's struggle is not al
ways against the world, but maybe'
against himself, and the real friend!
is the one who helps a man against
himself.
The genuine patriot loves his i
country too well to hate its vices;
we should not, then, tear to point
out what seem to us to he some of
the blunders of our American so
ciety.
The first great danger of our
American life is owing to the mo
notony of ideals. There is hardly
an American who does not make
attempts to become rich; who does
not envy those who are in better
situations of life than he; this mo
notony and drudgery of his life leads
to imitation and Hattery.
Another danger is the widespread
feeling of discontent, which leads
people to tiike up occupations and
cherish ambitions for which they are
not fitted; they even undergo pain
and humiliation in order that they
may be taken for something which
they are not. So a large number
of American people of this class are
ashamed of themselves; they adopt
the rudest imitations rather than
let their real occupation and posi
tion lie known. And in the same
way they attempt to make their
occupation a stepping-stone to
something else, neglecting that for
which they are titled, striving after
those things which belong to a dif
ferent class. The most slovenly
work in this country is done by
those who use some honorable oc
cupation in this manner. A good
blacksmith becomes a poor jeweler,
and a crude surgeon is made from
a. butcher. A third danger lies in
t he work of men of mediocre ability.
From such work two things result:
first, the work is badly done;
second, the work for which they are
lilted is not done at all or it is done
by others not fitted for it.
These dangers arise from the
lack of leaders. If there is one
thing essential it is the ability of
people to select leaders and their
willingness to follow them. To
judge wisely requires special train
ing and long experience. Every
community has a vast number of
needs ; corresponding to these
needs are the capacities, different
individuals possessing different
capacities. The ideal community
is where individual wants are satis
fied ; and to effect such a condi
tion there must be leaders trained
to satisfy these wants, and each in
dividual must be trained for that
occupation that his capacities lit
him to follow.
The individual also is called
upon to satisfy certain needs
needs of his own, needs of the fam
ily, national needs, and religious
needs. In an ideal community
every man supports himself, fam
ily. and church, and selects the
occupation fitted for him, and fol

lows it with the l>est good to the
community and to society at large.
For choosing :m occupation there
should he special training for it.
The fact that our school system is,
go much better than that of other!
countries should lead us to stimu- j
late our efforts to improve it where-1
ever possible. It is necessary in a j
democratic community that some |
things should be learned by all ;
extreme specialization is hazardous.
Manual training schools should be
established in every community;'
technical schools are indispensable
factors in every community. There!
is also great need of schools where
shipbuilding and navigation might |
be learned. There should be busi-1
ness schools where something else!
might be learned besides book-J
keeping; these schools should be I
places for downright hard work.
Schools for liberal training!
should be separate from schools fori
practical training. High schools j
may give at least so much as will di- ■
rect their graduates to care for their!
own interests ; the university should i
teach economics, politics, and
finance. History is indispensable.
Science, philosophy, and the arts i
might well he dispensed with in!
practical schools.
In this way many of the blund
ers of our American life might he
overcome. Education cannot do
all, but it can and should do much. |
