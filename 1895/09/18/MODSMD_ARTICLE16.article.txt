It is gratifying to see that the old
men are beginning to show the
proper interest in the game. A
number of the veterans took part in
yesterday's practice. There are,
however, several of last year's team
who should lend their enthusiasm
to encourage the green players.
About twenty-five men reported
for practice last night. Evidently,
we shall have a sufficient number
for two teams when the time comes
to line up. Yel there should be
enough men to keep four teams in
active practice. Berkeley started
out with forty candidates for her
eleven. With twenty-five candi
dates now, we should have at least
fifty in the same time that Berke
ley has been open. Captain Coch
ran wishes it urged that every foot
ball player, old or new, should
come forward and do his best for
the glorv of the University.
