# The 						Silver Question.
## 
### 
Hon. Wm. J. Bryan, member
of Congress from Nebraska, ad
dressed a large audience in the
i chape! this afternoon at 'J o'clock
ion his favorite theme, Free Coinage.
The audience was remarkable for
the preponderance of men, very few
worneif being present. The follow
ing is the substance of Congress
man Bryan's speech :
I regard the money question the
most important question in the
; world today, and the settlement of
I this question affects more vitally
i the interests of our people than the
j settlement of any question that has
1 been brought before our people
i since the time of peace; and in a
j country like this where laws arise
from the people, where government
is the people, and where every citi
zen is a sovereign, it is doubly ini
! portant.
This question is one on which
i people may differ, and yet differ
ences of opinion will depend upon
difference of interest. You will
Ijnd that generally a man will be
!on the side on which he finds his
interests to be. If you examine the
subject you will find that all parties
vote as they believe; they make up
their platform and go before the
people and try to show that their
interests lie on the side of the
party. Men expect by their vote
to protect their interests; whether
; it is a little question or a big one,
! you will find that men try to pre
serve their <>\\n immediate interest;
there may be a difference in people;
one may be far-sighted, another
short-sighted. Sometimes we find
people who favor a certain policy
and we say that they are short
sighted—you must always remem
ber that men's views are generally
shaped by what they believe to be
their interests and the interest of
those with tlieni.

I want now to call your atten
tion to what bimetallism is and
how we shall attain it. If we find
that the people desire it, it would
do no good unless we had some
way of obtaining it. I remember
one man who said that he was in
favor of bimetallism because he
thought that the government
should buy whatever metal it
wanted. There is a gentleman in
congress who said that he believed
bimetallism would come, but that
gold would be the basis.
Bimetallism simply means two
metallism, the fixing of the re
lation between two metals, making
both an equal legal tender.
Some people misunderstand what
1(> to 1 means. Does it mean that
the government will coin sixteen
silver dollars every time it coins
one of gold ? A Kentucky paper
—which is a gold-bug paper —
said that the reason the people of the
South were in favor of free silver
was because the government would
give sixteen dollars to one person.
l(i to 1 means the silver dol
lar will weigh as much as sixteen of
gold ; in paying power one ounce
of gold will equal sixteen ounces
of silver.
By free coinage we mean that if
you have silver bullion you may
take it to the mint and have it made
into money without cost ; it simply
means that the government will
make silver money as it does gold,
both without charge.
The reasons for this are appar
ent. In the first place, coining
money is a function of government;
and, secondly, unless you have
gratuitous coinage, you can not
have but one sound dollar that
you know anything about ; that is,
sound money that is worth as much
in bullion as in gold. You cannot
have that kind of money unless
you have free coinage. For ex
ample. if you take one hundred
cents worth of bullion to the mint
and it costs you five cents to have
it coined into a silver dollar, it will
not be worth one hundred cents,
but ninty-five cents.
There are people who tell us that
we ought to have no other kind of
money but gold—and yet they want
to have national bank notes. The
government fixes the value of money
when it stamps it ; why not the
same with silver? There would
not beany difference between the
bullion value and the coinage
value.
By unlimited coinage we mean
only to treat silver as we do gold.
Now some people believe that if we
have unlimited coinage of silver,
the country would lie flooded with
silver from abroad. Well, suppose
the Englishman brings his silver
to the mint and has it coined.
What will he do with it? There
is no use in taking it back with
him. So when lie brings it here he
uses it here. This he can do in
one of several ways.
1. He can give us the money
and go home; this lie would hardly
be likely to do.
2. lie can exchange thesilver for
gold and take the gold home. This
is what our opponents arc afraid
of. Mr. Carlisle, in a speech made
i by him, said that over $(100,000,-
000 would thus go out of circu
lation in this eountrv. And if this

amount did go out of circulation,
the currency would then be con
tracted so that silver would become
dearer; and it would require fifteen
years to coin enough silver to take
its place. Hut if gold is driven on.
of the country silver will become
dearer, and the cheaper money,
i gold, will come back.
8. Instead of taking our gold
away he might come and buy our
! goods and leave bis silver; an<;
i that is just what we want him t<>
do.
Whenever we find men who say
that we have plenty of money we
may be sure that they are generally
those who have it. And thequestion
J arises: How are we going to get
| hold of more money? Some people
! want it to come from abroad. But
! it should come from our own moun
! tains ; and the very people who re-
I joice in the importation of foreign
j money are the very ones who say
'that we have enough money.
Now, they say we cannot have
two standards ; but this compar
ison is misleading, for the dollar
changes in relative value while the
yard-stick does not. The reason
we want bimetallism is to come
more nearly to a stable standard ;
|if we can find a standard that is
! twice as stable as the gold dollar
Iwe shall than come nearer having
j an honest dollar.
We believe bimetallism is right
• because, lirst, the use of two metab
j gives us a more stable value than
only one would do. As sometimes
j gold increases in value and some
| times silver, the volume will be
more stable.
Second, when the debtor has the
option it is to the interest of the
people to keej) the metals at par;
while the creditor will try to drive
them apart and then get the prem
ium.
There is a practical necessity for
bimetallism, because there is not
enough gold to do the business of
the world. The action of this
nation will do a great deal towards
influencing the action of the rest of
the world.
