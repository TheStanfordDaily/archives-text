to carry on their conversation in
the library ; but those who are dis

in the reading room.

of coming legal lights to argue
knotty problems before an appar

ritated roomful! of students, fre
quently leads them to trespass
upon the time of others.
It is hoped that a remark calling
attention to the fact will put an
end to the annoyance.
