Now that the Freshman-Sopho
more rush has taken place, the
first conventional ceremony has
»een enjoyed by the incomingclass
nen. Unless a break into prece
dent is to be made, there are other
ceremonies no less pleasant than
the rush, still to take place in
honor of the tin de sieele class.
Among these felicities of the col
legian's life might he mentioned the
Sophomore reception to the Fresh
ncn. Thus far, there seems to
have been little more than talk on
this subject, when plans should be
in process of arrangement for bring
ing the affair to successful issue.
Functions of this description far

more than pay for themselves in
the good fellowship and friendly
feeling they evoke. This matter
! should be taken uj> at once and
brought to a settlement. Surely
the Class of '98, which has proved
j itself as energetic as any in Col
lege, is not going to he the first to
i omit the usual reception to the in
! coming class.
It is time that the Freshmen
were actively at work to shape and
j organize their team. Though too
! early to begin active work in any
direction other than preliminary
I practice, it is by no means ton
early to place tlie team on a sub
stantial basis, to put it in such a
j position that all the work of cap-
J tain and manager need not be
crowded into the short space of
time between Thanksgiving and
December 7. Most important of
| all these preliminary arrangements
is the placing of games with out
side teams. Lack of tbis practice
was the thing above all others that
brought disaster on '98. Before
Thanksgiving last year the men of
'98 received a certain amount of
training as individuals, but they
lined up against Berkeley without
that team work which is essential
to good play. No amount of good
individual work can make up the
I lack of good team play, and last
j year's Freshmen realized this only
| after they met the Berkeleyans--
I and were t heirs.
