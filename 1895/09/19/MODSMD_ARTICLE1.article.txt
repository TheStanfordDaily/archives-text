# THE
						HILDEBRAND LIBRARY.
## Most Important of the Recent Additions to the Equipment of the University. 
### 
The library of the late Prof.
11 ildebrand, of Leipzig, arrived dur
ing the summer and is now a part
of Stanford University. The fif
teen large boxes containing the
library were shipped from Ham
burg to New Orleans by steamer.
From New Orleans they were
brought to Palo Alto free of charge
by the Southern Pacific Railroad
and Wells-Fa rgo Express Com
panies.
The llildebrand Library is the
only one of its kind in this country.
None of the other universities have
anything which begins to approach
its riches in old German literature.
An attempt was made by some of
the Eastern universities to secure
ibi* library, but their telegrams
were not received until after the
deal with Stanford University had
been closed. Our good fortune in
securing the library is, to a very
gre;it extent, due to the prompt and
decisive action of Prof. Goebel, who
had known Professor llildebrand
while at the University of Leipzig.
It was with much regret that
Germany saw this rich treasure
leave her shores. The Prussian
minister of education tried to pro
cure the collection for the govern
ment even after our representative
had completed the purchase. The
directors of the Goethe-Schiller
archives at Weimar were willing to
buy the entire library for the sake
of getting the old editions of Goethe
and Schiller contained therein.
In upacking the library, it was
â€¢found to be even more valuable
than it had appeared from the cata
logue. Among the books on Ger
man literature and philology are
contained a great many rare prints
and editions of the greatest value
which can scarcely be procured to
day.
The works of literature pertain
ing to the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries are mostly original edit
ions of that period. Some copies
are Worth between fifty and one
hundred dollars each. The col
lection of the eighteenth century
literature is probably unequalled
in regard to completeness. A special
feature of the library is the collect
ion of the Folksongs, for which the
library was famous for many years
in Germany. Many of the books
contain the most valuable annota
tions by Professor Hildebrand's
hand, some of which will doubtless
be published bv the German de
partment.
The general appearance of the
books is very good despite the fact
that it was a working library which
had been in use for fifty years.
About one third of the books
have been placed in the seminary
room of the German department.
The others are in the University
Library. The books in the Ger
man seminary room are those per
taining to German philology and
literature. Those in the University
Library are useful for other depart
ments. Here will be found the
greatest part of the dictionaries and
works in history, general literature,
philosophy, theology, French and
English literature, and philology.
That the library is appreciated

jean lie seen from the fact that the
i advanced classes in German are
unusually large this year. Several
j students have come here for the
'special purpose of doing work with
its aid.
The greater part of the purchase
| money has been paid, hut there
still remains quite a sum. The
; students contributed most liberally
up to June J, and it is hoped that
the new students will also do what
is in their power to payoff the rest.
Professor Goebel will be grateful
for any contribution sent him. A
book containing the names of all
contributers will be kept with the
librarv.
