Prof. Warner of this University, i
in a caustic paper read at the!
Prison Congress in Denver, has sue-1
ceeded in drawing the attention of j
the country to the true phase of the J
criminal situation. The vigorous'
manner in which Dr. Warner at
tacked the subject is characteristic!
of the man. Thoroughly scientific j
in his work and fearless in his as-j
saults on all that he believes wrong, |
Prof. Warner is a powerful ad-]
versary on any such question as!
that under discussion.
Prof. Warner's remarks are given
in another column, and need no
repetition here. Warden Hale of i
the California State Prison at San
(iuentin saw fit to take issue with
Dr. Warner. With all due respect I
to the director of our State Prison,!
we are of the opinion that he has
undertaken more of a task than lie
supposed. Pnless he lacks the dis
cretion for which he is credited,
Warden Hale will beat a retreat,
und that in short order.
