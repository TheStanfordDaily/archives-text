The Pioners as a class are de
funct. As individuals they are
missed, but sis a whole, it is perhaps
well they have moved on into the
big world. \Ve were becoming too
dependent upon them, and talent
in other classes was apt to be
hidden under the proverbial bushel.
Each pioneer in pursuing his or

j her career in far-away towns can-'
not but impress some Stanford per-j
j sonality upon the community. The;
1 wonderful influence of a great edu-j
Icational institution like our own
will begin to pervade the western;
j coast and be felt in nearly every j
town, while the classes left behind]
will follow the many precedents
established by our first great gradu
: ating class. May '96 fulfill her ob-
I ligations, and show herself able to
j sustain the reputation given Stan
ford by the Pioneers, and, as each
j year should furnish greattr possi
bilities and thus impose greater ob
| ligations, may she even surpass in
j achievements the honor of the (.'lass
' of '95.
