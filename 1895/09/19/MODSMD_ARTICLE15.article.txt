It is a great temptation, in these
first days of our meeting with old
friends and the re-forming of ties,
to neglect the "stranger within our
gates." In the crowded life we
lead, as students who are inter
ested in many enterprises and pur
suits beside the all engrossing work
of studying, it is difficult to lind
time for our nearest friends, and
next to impossible to call upon
strangers. Yet we should remem
ber those long, dreary days when
we were without friends, when work
was confused, and the quadrangle
seemed a maze. Then, Stanford
seemed an inhospitable desert, and
we wondered how people ever be
came acquainted. We were awed
to see young people conversing with
such familiarity to their professors.
The process of making friends
was a long and a hard one, and we
should make it easy for the incom
ers. Quadrangle courtesy takes
very little time, yet often a day is
brightened or clouded by a small
negligence on our part, that is con
strued into a slight by the sensitive
new student. There often are de
lightful people whom we meet only
as we are about to leave. Then it
is that we wonder why we neglected
to at least become acquainted with
all of those whose lives brushed
against ours.
Let us pause a moment in our
modern and unhealthy stampede
for culture and devotea little energy
to fostering the old-fashioned vir
tues of unselfishness and hospital
ity.
