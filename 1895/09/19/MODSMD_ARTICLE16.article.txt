# The 						Sensation of the Prison Congress.
## 
### 
The following special dispatch
appeared in yesterday's Chron
icle from Denver concerning the
paper prepared by Dr. Warner and
read before the Prison Congress in
session there. The sensation re
sulting from it was precipitated by
Warden Hale of San Quentin who
vehemently denounced the paper.
Professor Amos (i. Warner's
paper, which excited the resentment
of so many people at the Prison
Congress at Unity Church last
night, is still a subject of discussion
among the delegates; many of them
hold their positions through politi
cal influence.
In the course of the essay I he fol
lowing was said:
'"The illustration of solidarity of
evil brings us back to the opinion
of the criminal, that if the local
officials with whom he conies in
contact are corrupt then society as
a whole is as corrupt as himself.
''What we have called his 'opin
ion' is little more than a feeling, an
instinct. But it is not so prepos
terous and unreasonable as one
could wish. If a corrupt police de
partment exists year after year it
does not seem to be an unreason
able implication that it is as good
a police department as the com
munity cares to take the trouble to
have. The community is, in fact,
particeps criminis, and a further
lact already hinted at, which has
not perhaps attained the notoriety
it deserves, confirms the same view.
''Even when the spoils of politics
does not issue in definite and mani
fest corruption, it still has a terrible
paralyzing influence upon all at
tempts to reform criminals. Wher
ever politics is a wholly selfish
business and 'the art of winning
elections' is practiced as a means
of livelihood by men not qualified
for the offices to which they attain,
we have a blundering, obtuse, and
conscienceless management of in
stitutions.
"'A teacher who was looking up
local conditions as a preparation
for lecturing on crime found that
the only man connected with
the county who had an unselfish
interest in prison reform was one
of the prisoners. The sheriff of
the county said he was in office to
make all he could out of it,
'honestly,' which meant 'legally.'
He was a great improvement on
his predecessor, who was believed
to have given his cupidity an even
freer rein.
"In sudi an institution and it
is typical of two-thirds of our
county institutions the criminal
must come to feel that the State is
as selfish as himself, though it may
not be as criminal. I have re
ferred to a county institution in
California.
''And yet what other thought can
be instilled into the mind of a
young man whose wildness has not
yet ripened into crime? lie can
get drinks on Sunday in violation
of the law, perhaps because money
is pa id the police, and peril aps be
cause the saloonkeeper whom lie
patronizes is a city alderman. The
gambling den to which he goes en
joys immunity from interference.
The light from the passageway
leading to it shinesouton the pave
ment, where brass-buttoned police
men walk with eyes that see not,
because the man who runs the es
tablishment is a reputable com
mitteeman from that ward."
