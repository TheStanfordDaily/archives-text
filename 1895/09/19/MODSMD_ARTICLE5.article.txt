# THE
						GLEE CLUB
## Members for This Year Chosen Yesterday Evening. 
### 
The applicants for the Glee Club
met yesterday at 4 p.m. in compe
tition for places. A large number
were present so that but a meager
test was accorded each. Mr. Mor
ris of Palo Alto had charge of the
trial.
Those chosen for first tenor were
W. A. Sutherland, '98, Fred
Schneider, "08, Merle Johnson, '98;
for second tenor, B. I). Wigle, '95,
W. C. McNeil, '98, E. E. Farmer,
'95, W. J. Neidig, '96, Geo. Hush,
'98; for lirst bass, Carl Decker, '98,
E. M. Hulme, '97, C. 13. Pinkliam,
'96, P. F. Abbott, '98, 1. E. Outcalt,
'9">; for second bass, A. G. Kauf
man, '96, P>. E. Snipes, '98, W. T.
Young, '97, Guy Cochran, '96, and
Schlack, '99.
As several from second tenor,
first bass, and second bass are
to be placed as a reserve for emer
gencies, the men are expected to at
tend all meetings and to do the
work assigned them conscientiously
unless they wish to be placed on
that list. A number of tours are
in prospect, so a tine glee club will
have t<> be formed to meet these
engagements. At present the pros
pect is very bright indeed.
