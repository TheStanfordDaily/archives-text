important matter that came up was
the interpretation of the words

caused some dispute and an inter
pretation was necessary.

the payment of all the legtimate
running expenses of all student
enterprises, it being understood
that expenses or permanent im
provements are not to be included,
and that this Committee is to be
the judge of what constitutes per
manent improvements.
The motion was seconded by
