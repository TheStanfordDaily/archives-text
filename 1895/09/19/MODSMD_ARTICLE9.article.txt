Fvery day sees one or two new men
join the ranks of tlie wearers of the
moleskin. The football squad is
growing steadily, and there is prom
ise of a successful year. The new
men are showing up ;is well as can
be expected; the old men begin t<>
show the proper spirit and the new
field is fast assuming suitable shape.
Hut there is one thing lacking—a
promising fullback. This position
is going to be hard to fill with us,
while it is pretty sure to be Berk
eley's strong point. Capt. Cochran's
punting is the best up to date. He
does not kick very far, but he has
the proper form and shows a great
deal of strength. Weldon punts a
long distance, but his punting is
not sufficiently sure.
The new men show a woeful lack
of training in catching the ball.
Instead of heeding their captain's
orders, three or four men will rush
for the same ball. Of course this
is very amusing for the spectators,
but it spoils the effectiveness of the
practice. These same men should
remember, also, that this is not the
baseball season. A baseball can
be caught in the outstretched hands
but a football can only be caught
in the arms and against the body.
Fickert, Frankenheimer, Cotton,
Code, Thomas, Pauly, Harrington,
Dole, and Campbell were the old
men who aided Cochran in coach
ing last night. Harrelson expects
to be on ihe field tonight to lend
bis aid in giving the freshmen
pointers. It is to be hoped that
more of the old men will soon find
time to go into active training.
There should be more suits at
hand. Several good men are pre
vented from work because they can
not obtain the proper equipment.
