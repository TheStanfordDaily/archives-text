facts about Berkeley's football

who is himself a Vale man:
"Hutterworth, who will coach the
fool ball team of the University of
California, is due to arrive here just
one week hence. When he arrives he
will find that Captain Sherman has
followed his i nst met ions implicitly.
1 lis coining is awaited with inter
est, as the effect will be to stimulate
the football players, and strict dis
cipline will lie the rule. Walter
Camp is almost sure to be the
coach at Stanford, or such is the
opinion here. Buiterworth. who is
the son of Congressman Hen Hutter
worth. is, according to Prof. Clapp,
a. society light. His lignre is slight
and his features are delicate and
refined. He looks more like a poet
than an athlete. He is twenty
three years old, ."> feet I 1 inches tall,
and weighs in training only 158
pounds. He became a member of
the Vale I'niversity team in his
sophomore year, and in his junior
year was known to he the strongest
line-bueker in the country. He
possesses great power to inspire
enthusiasm, as shown when he has
appeared as substitute captain
of the Vale team. He is a
member of the Skull and Hones
Society, which is the most exclusive
of college secret societies.
"In the famous game of '98 be
tween Princeton and Vale," says
Prof. Clapp. "when Vale was out of
condition and exhausted by having
played with Harvard only five days
earlier, experienced observers saw
that the game depended on Butter
worth. He was called up to buck,
and when he failed to make dis
tance. it was seen that Vale would
lose the game, and so it turned out.
The next year, when the elevens of
both Vale and Princeton were
practically the same, Vale being in
good condition, Vale won bv 24 to
<1. Hutterworth would have been
the Vale captain had it not been
that it was desired to give llinkey
the chance to retrieve the defeat of
the preceding season."
