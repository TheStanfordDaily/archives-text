# On the New Field.
## 
### 
About thirty men took psirt in
the football practice last night.
The new lield adjacent to the base
ball diamond was used for the
first time. In some ways it is an
improvement over the old oval, but
in others it is inferior. The ground
is, in fact, too sloping for match
games and like the old lield will
become too hard after a rain. If a
sufficient amount of straw could be
plowed in and some sand spread
over the top of the field the latter
evil would be avoided. The sand
would make it lit to play on in
any weather and the straw would
give it more elasticity and do away
with a great man}' accidents from
hard falls.
llice, J< .)7, began training yester
day, as did Holbrook, who played
with his class team at Ann Arbor.
Quite an animated scene is to be
witnessed in the gymnasium after
the field work. There are several
excellent gymnasts in the squad
and their work shows up to good
advantage. A number of specta
tors are always present
