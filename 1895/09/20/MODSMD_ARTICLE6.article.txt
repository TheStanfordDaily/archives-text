Since the new field has been put
in temporary shape for play, it is
apparent that the new gridiron is
likely to prove far more satisfactory
than the oval. Players last night
stated that there was but one ob
jection to the new field, viz., the
slight difference in elevation
between the ends. After the first
rains a few loads of sand at the
lower end would remedy the difii
culty. It was at first supposed
that a football field partly encroach
ing on the diamond would ruin the
latter. It is quite safe to say that
what little damage might be done
to the diamond could be repaired
at far less expense than could the
cinder path if the oval had been
used for football purposes.
