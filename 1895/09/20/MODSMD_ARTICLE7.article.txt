The folly of pit ting the Stanford
football team against such a team
as the Reliance at the very begin
ning of the season was so strongly
impressed last year on the minds
of the present management that it
is quite unlikely such a mistake
will be repeated. Had the first
game last season been played about
the middle of October when the
college men had acquired a certain
amount of stamina and proficiency
in the game, the score would have
been much closer.
Manager Eaton wisely declined
all propositions to play this year
until the men should be able to do
themselves justice. When the first
scheduled game does occur, the
Stanford representatives will at
least be in fair condition for it.
