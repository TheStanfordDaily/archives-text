# FOR THANKSGIVING NIGHT.
## All the Stanford Musical Organizations to Unite in a Huge Entertainment in San Francisco. 
### 
The managers representing the
Orchestra, the Glee and Mandolin
Clubs, and the Hand have combined
and have been working since the
lirst production of " Hinafore" upon
a mammoth Stanford entertain
ment which is to show the State of
California that not only.can we
play football in a highly creditable
manner, but are replete with musi
cal and dramatic talent.
Berkeley has for the past two
years given on the night of the
great game a very good minstrel
show, using local talent only, while
we have been content to watch a
second-class professional perform
ance, interspersed with a few local
hits.
Our histrionic talent was demon
strated last year in several differ
ent lines of stage work, and the
new managers intend to give an en
tertainment Thanksgiving night
that shall lie a representative per
formance, one in which neither
trouble nor money shall be spared.
All our organized groups of musi
cians, numbering over fifty, are en
thusiastic for the success of this
entertainment. The Glee, Mando
dolin, and Banjo Clubs, and the Or
chestra will be on raised seats,
while on the front row will be col
lege minstrels who promise to con
vulse the audience by local hits,
topical songs, and a new species of
Stanford humor, generated for the
occasion. A burlesque on "living
pictures" in which the good folks
at Stanford will see themselves as
others see them is to be a special
feature.
The attaches of the Columbia
Theatre are already at work on the
scenic and electrical effects.
It is desirious that Ihe entire au
dience shall sing Stanford songs,
and feel an enthusiasm never be
fore displayed by us. There are to
be issued artistic souvenirs with
local songs and pictures of the two
football teams — souvenirs of our
first theatre party that is purely
Stanford.
If every one co-operates and
lends his aid, be it great or small,
this entertainment not only will
furnish an abundance of fun for
ourselves but will reflect credit
upon the University.
