Copies of the '96 Annual, the
Stanford Quad, Vol. 11, can still
lie procured. New students will do
well to get them now, as college
annual editions are soon exhausted
and new editions are never issued.
Yet nothing in a university's liter
ature is more important than its
junior annuals. Features of its
history that .appear in no other form
are preserved here and in after
years the fortunate possessor of a
set of annuals has a valuable set
of "original sources."
The Annual cannot now he
bought of the dealers and are al
ready at a premium. The day will
soon come when the same will he
said of the second volume of the
series.
