The result of the international!
athletic; contest on Manhattan Field!
Saturday was a thorough surprise j
to even those most sanguine of I
victory. That one side should cap-!
ture every one of the entire num-1
ber of firsts in such a .contest was
without precedent in the history of I
athletics. Never has so signal a
victory been won before. In ad-1
dition, the breaking of four world's
records in eleven events proves in
disputably the superiority of the
New York Athletic Club team over
any group of athletes that has ever
been gathered under the colors of
one club.
But a far greater cause for self

congratulation on the part of Anieri- 1
cans is the smoothness with which;
i the contest was conducted, and the
j 7
j good-will and fairness exhibited to-J
wards the visiting team. All this,
scorning in such close contrast with;
| the disagreeable incidents of the!
| yacht race, has placed track and)
tield athletics several notches
higher in the regard of the Ameri-j
