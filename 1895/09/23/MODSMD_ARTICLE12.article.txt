Fou two years or more Stanford
I University has had a Press Club, I
! strange as such statement may ap-
I pear. The Club has been a silent
| organization since its inception,
i and has been so dead an affair that
| nine out of ten students would
j never have known of its existence.)
j Occasionally it murmured in its
j sleep, but as a rule its rest was un
disturbed. It is about time that
an association which might be
i made as useful as this, should be i
j roused into action. Theolder mem-1
bers should bestir themselves to
i
i make the Press Club what it should
J be. There would be no lack of en
couragement, once the impetus was
| given.
Without any journalistic course
I in the curriculum, Stanford might
| still many of her scholars a
j general idea of practical newspaper
| work through her Press Club.
| There are many of the brightest
I newspaper men in the country re
) siding in this section of the state,
| who would be only too glad to ad
i dress the journalistically inclined
| on interesting newspaper subjects.
There is one other benefit which ;
might be expected from an active
press club, and that is this : with
all its friends, Stanford University
| has not one too many. In the
| journalistic field this is particula rly
| true. By getting leading newspaper
| men interested in this College and
I by treating them in the cordial
i manner they should be treated
j when they visit us, Stanford Uni-j
! versity would have many morel
! valuable friends in the very places j
! where they would do her most good. I
