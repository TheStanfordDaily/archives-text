# "Ideal Manhood and How to Obtain It"

### 
Bishop Henry \Y\ Warren
preached Sunday morning before a
crowded chapel. The following is
the sermon in brief.
If the Lord had said to some
scoundrel, a traitor to his country;
a sneaking, lying, ignoble fellow,
"Ye must be born again," we should
have said of course nothing would
follow of that sort. But when he
said to a man of culture, of great
power and influence, "Ye must be
born again," then the thought is
different. There is a life so high
that culture cannot reach it; there
is a life that is so pure that it lasts
forever. Some of the character
istics of that life appear in the first
chapter of Ephesians.
Of the twelve men who accom
panied tlie Lord and who after
ward went out into the world

preaching the Gospel—in your
study of these twelve men which of
them have you come [to love hest?
You know that we are disposed to
; like those that are like us. 1 sup
pose there were twelve disciples ap
pointed so that every man might
i find himself represented in those
that accompanied our Lord. Which
one are you most like? Take the
Apostle John, a hot-headed, fervent
man, careless of results, and who
wanted to call down the anger of
1 heaven upon a certain city that had
rejected the Lord. If it chances
I that you are like him. remember
that by grace he became gentle and
; is spoken of as the loved disciple,
j and it was he who said, ''Little
| children love one another."'
Perhaps you are like Peter: a
man who felt that he was above the
| temptations of humanity; who said
i "'Though other men may forsake
I thee yet will not 1"; and still the
| first one to deny the Lord and to
| emphasize his denial with oaths.
! If you are like Peter, remember
I that after he was converted he was
! anxious to speak to his brethren.
| So if you are like Peter by nature
you can be like him by grace.
Then there was Thomas who al
ways doubted. " Except I put my
lingers in his wounds 1 will not
believe.'' We will remember that
this man really did get out of his
doubts and left signs of his great
work from that time to this; so if
i you are like Thomas, be, like
! Thomas, progressive.
Then there is Haul, who had more
influence in the world than any
man that ever lived; whose writ
lings run down through the world
with increasing power; hundreds
j of millions of editions of his works
j have appeared in the earth. Evi
dently such a man must be loved
: by us all above any other.
And this brings us to the Epistle
j to the Ephesians. 1 believe this to be
the greatest in speech, in thought, in
ideal of anything in human litera
ture. Of all things ever put into
speech, this has higher ideals for
man than anything 1 know of.
W hat was God's first word about
man, God's first thought? When
all tlie works of creation had been
I finished, God wanted a crown for
it all. and said, "Let us make man
in our own image"; that was God's
lirst thought for his child. As long
as he remained in the image of
i God, he kept this dominion; the
scepter wrung out of his hand, is
held to beat him over the head. In
proportion as man comes into God's
image, he comes to his designed
jend; and when this end is finished,
i the great revelation is that we may
be kings: '"and he shall have do
minion over ten cities."'
By and by, according to the les
son, God is to hold a "universe"
; exposition; and he is to hold us up
and show bis exceeding great kind
ness; we are to be the exhibits,
alongside the stature of manhood
we are to stand. God grant that
in that hour we may not be
dwarted; that we may lit- like unto
God's own image.
There is provided a power to
realize ideals; poets may sing
i loftily nf the possibilities of the
race, but they have not the power
to make it possible. The Apostle
savs: " And considering not onlv

the inheritance, but considering j
what is the exceeding greatness of i
his power to us-ward " ; the same
power he wrought in Christ when
he raised him from the dead in i
order that that ideal might be ac
complished.
In a cold dungeon in Rome was]
the apostle Haul; he was used to the j
best society, learned, belonged to
the best class of people in thecoun- i
try. What is the portend of his
thought? 1s it denunciation oi
man for the trials and imprison- 1
ments he suffered ? No. No cries, i
no wails of pessimism, but he seeks
to bless bis brethren. lie has
nothing that he can send them, but:
he tells us that he has a way to j
bless them.
When you touch a key on this!
side of the Atlantic, and the re
sponse is on the other side, there is
transmission of matter, but only of:
power. And so Haul says; "1 pray!
that ye may be strengthened by liisi
spirit in the inner man." What we :
want is the development of power;
inside. What the coward needs is |
not the exchange of his soul for the |
soul of a courageous man, but to be
strengthened inside.
How different we are! * There;
was Heter who, when it was sug-1
gested to him by the girl that he|
was a Nazarene, denied that he was |
of the same party as Christ; and;
yet when he was strengthened by
this power he faced all .Jerusalem
Ire iching of Christ.
Then there is another thought:
"Strengthened that Christ may
dwell in your hearts by faith in
order that ye may be able to com-'
prebend and know the iove of God
that passeth knowledge." Every j
thing that God ever did passes our
knowledge. God never spoke* to
anything without leaving in it more
wisdom than we can ever find out.
When He said "Let there be" —that
one utterance of creative power put
more into this world than we have
ever been able to find out. "Let
there be light." We have studied
it and we have written volumes
about life, but with no new light.
No man is a holy man until he
is a whole man; he is to stand up
in the statue of God until he is a
whole man. Those who are great
only in one single respect are not
really great. If you take the per- j
sons who are called great and com
bine their faculties and this flower
of creation, this man great in every
respect, is God's ideal of every one
of us.
