There was an unusually large
crowd of spectators for so early in
the season. The men played with
considerable snap, and altogether
things appear rather promising.
One objectionable feature was the
condition of the field. It is entirely
too dusty. Men cannot do their
best when their lungs and nostrils
are tilled with dirt. Something
should be done at once to remedy
this evil.
Fickert made the best showing of
any of the center men. lie was
very strong in defensive work and
his aggressive work was up to the
average. Lewers, who played op
posite him, did exceedingly well
fora man green in the position.
Harrington had an easy time of
it at guard and broke up the first
team's plays effectively. Garton
had everything his way until
Thomas was put in against him.
Campbell played well at tackle.
Mcintosh, was in every play
and tackled well. Dole surpassed
all the rest of the halfbacks. He.
made one touch-down from the
center of the field and several other
good runs. Brown, Leavitt, and
Plate did good work.
At the end of the practice each
side had a touch-down in its favor.
