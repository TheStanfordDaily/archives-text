# Saturday's Practice.
## 
### 
The play on Saturday was less
snappy than on the preceding
night. There was more dust and a
great deal too much fumbling.
Nearly all the runs were attempts
at line bucking, which failed as a
rule because the backs persisted in
running low high. Fickert was in
every play. Thomas was able to
break up his opponents' plays be
cause the man opposite him was
very weak. The ends on both
tennis were lamentably weak. Some
punting was attempted but as a
rule the kicks fell short. The play
showed one thing —that there is
need <>112 coaching. The old players
should take some of the new men
in hand and teach them the ele
ments of the game.
