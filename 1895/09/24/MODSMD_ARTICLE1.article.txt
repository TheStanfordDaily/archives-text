# The
						Mandolin Club Tour.
## 
### 
During the past summer the
Stanford Mandolin Club and the
University of California Glee Club
in combination made the most ex
tensive tour yet taken by either
organization. For the first time in
their historv the clubs went out of
the state, and so successful was the
trip and so novel did the idea of
the combination prove that the
venture will probably be repeated
on a much more extensive scale
during the summer vacation of ' ( .)6.
The idea <>112 two rival universities
combining their principal musical
organizations for such an extended
tour is unprecedented in the history
of college organizations. Ihe result,
however, was most satisfactory. On
all sides the clubs were received
with enthusiasm, and social favors
were heaped upon them. From a
musical and financial standpoint
the trip was an undoubted success.
The clubs left San Francisco,
Monday. June 8. The personnel

From Marvsville the clubs went to
Eugene, Oregon, where a reception
was given them by ihe University
of Oregon. On June 6 a concert
was given in the city. The Eugene
Itcr/inter of June 7 has the follow
ing: "The Opera House was well
filled last night with the highest
circles and the best society of this
fair city to witness the concert
given bv the Stanford-Berkeley
Concert Company. . . . The
Stanford Mandolin Club gave the
audience a ripple of pleasure by
their playing. Everyone a thor
ough musician ajid master of his
instrument, they gave a delightful
rendition of each number in a way
never before heard by a Eugene
audience, and the applause greet
ing each number was terrific. The
Berkeley Glee Club, in addition to
their program, made several hits,
and proved themselves singers,'
everyone of them, 'Schneider's!
Band 'and the k Cradle Song' prob- i
ablv being the most appreciated.
Summing it up as a whole, one
would be safe in saying that this
company is the best of its kind ever
heard in Eugene. . . . Socially,;
they are as fine a crowd of students j
as one would care to meet, and by
their gentlemanly behavior and tal
ented concerts are making bests of
friends everywhere."

On June 7 and 8 the dubs ap-
I pea red in Albany and Salem, Ore
! gon, respectively. In botb towns
I the most fluttering notices were re
ceived. PI it- Salem Stntexman of
•Iline i) says:
\ " The corning of this combination
i lias been looked forward to with
| considerable pleasure in musical
land college circles, and the twink
! litig music of the Mandolin Club
land the well blended voices of the
| (ilce Club fully justified the very
i many complimentary criticisms
: that the chrbs have received. Un
j doubtedlv the clubs are the best of
i the kind ever heard in Salem, and
, it is safe to say that it would be
'difficult to find their equals and
j impossible to find their superiors
in any of the colleges of the coun
try. The Mandolin Club was es
j pedallv happy in its selections, all
of which received well merited and
I enthusiastic encores. The ' Polish
| Dance' is well adapted to the in
jstruments; ' Por Quien Suspiras '
was beautifully rendered. The
| C * lee Club showed itself to be in
I good voice, and every number it
I gave received repeated encores.
|' Schneider,s Band, was among the
best of the selections Mile.
Calliope Cardinale (Mr. C. K.
Field of Stanford) did a clever bit
of impersonation. lie is perfectly
! suited to the part he acts, and his
| singing would be a credit to many
; a professional prima donna."
From Salem the clubs went to
• the Sound, playing the Sound cities
during the week: Taeoma, .1 line 10,
, Olympia, June 11; Seattle, June
12; Everett, June, 18; New W'hat
; com, June 18; and Seattle again
June 16. The same hearty recep
| tions and the same tenor in the
write-ups of the concerts were stiil
noticeable. The Seattle Poxt-lnlAU
\ (fencer gave considerable space to
a criticism of the concert, from
: which the following is taken:
'• The most artistic and thor
j oughly delightful event in musical
j circles this year was beyond a doubt
I the concert given by the Stanford
; Mandolin Club and the University
I of California Glee Club last night
I in the Seattle Theatre The
| evening passed more like one spent
in the private parlors of some weal
thy entertainer than in a house of
public amusement. The whole
program was given in a way that
i showed careful and conscientious
training and a full appreciation of
musical art. The evening will
! surely be long remembered by all
whose good fortune it was to be
present Together the two
j clubs rendered ' Fstudiantina,' the
vocalists putting much life into
their singing and the musicians
| displaying delicacy of touch. . . .
I The selection which the Stanford
students next played was perhaps
the best, of the evening—sweet and
delicious, with a shade of sadness
in the background, and tingling
with memories of love."
The following extract is taken
from a long account of tin 1 Taeoma
concert given in the Taeoma
ftC.dfirr of >1 line 11:
"Society was out in full force to
attend the concert given last night
at ('bickering Halt by the Uni
versity of California Glee Club
and tlie Stanford University Man
dolin Club. Artistieallv the con

cert was a huge success. Socially
it was the etfent of the weeek. .
Encore after encore was accorded
the various numbers. Tacoma
audiences as a rt'le are disposed to
he coldly critical in musical mat
ters, hut genuine enthusiasm was
shown at last night's concert. The
playing of the Stanford Mandolin
Club as a whole was exquisite,
while individually the quartette is
worthy of special mention. These
four gentlemen play together as if
hut one instrument was being
touched, and that by a master
hand. The thirteen young men
composing the I'Diversity of Cali
fornia Glee Club sang themselves
into the hearts of the audience as
only college boys can."
The first Portland concert, given
on June 17, was undoubtedly the
most successful given during the
entire trip. The clubs were in
their best condition, and the house
was the largest and most fashion
able that greeted the clubs. The
following extract is taken from the
Orcrjonian of .1 line 18 :
" The Marquam was in gala at
tire last night, hung with the dif
ferent club decorations and colors
in honor of the appearance in this
city of the combination of the Uni
versity of California Glee Club and
the Stanford University Mandolin
Club. Society was out in full force.
Enthusiasm prevailed
from the riseof the curtain through
out the entire performance. The
opening and closing numbers of the
two clubs were exceptionally well
done in point of ensemble. ' Pre
dicaments' by the U. C. Glee Club,
with Mr. lluss as soloist, proved
him possessed of a very agreeable
voice. The Stanford Mandolin Club
brought down the house, to which
recall they responded with 'Gaiety
March.' Kverv number was mark*<l
with smoothness and precision,arid,
on the whole, the college boys gave
a most pleasing concert. This is
the only combination of the sort
where two rival colleges have joined
forces with such agreeable results.
These young men have made friends
all over the territory which they
have covered, and have conducted
themselves as gentlemen through
out. Ihe tour has been verv suc
cessful so far, as thev have met
with social and financial success
everywhere "
Vancouver, Washington, was
played on .June IS, and a return
