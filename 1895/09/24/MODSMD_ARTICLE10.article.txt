With the arrival of Prof. Henry
Huntington Powers Stanford ('Di
versity has acquired a valuable ad
dition to her faculty corps. Prof.
Powers is one of the leading soci
ological authorities of this country,
and is also well known through his
articles on finance, which have ap
peared from time to time in the
leading economic journals of the
I' nift d States.
Prof. Powers has come directly
from <«recce, a distance of 10,00*0
mi !es, within three weels--. He spen 112
the | ast slimmer traveling in Europe
for pleasure and for the purpose of
acquiring a library. For many
years he has spent his summers in
Furope and is conversant with
European affairs and questions.
<Mi the money question Prof.
Power* expressed himself quite
freely, lie is in favor of bimetal
lism provided it can be brought
about by a syndicate of three large
nations.
"I believe," said the professor,
"that the I'nited States alone
should never attempt to shoulder a
silver standard unless she is backed
by two such nations as France and
(Jermany. It will take a syndicate
of at least three leading nations
of the world to float the world's
silver. When a settlement has
finally been made of this question,
however, it will be found that there
is a far more serious problem un
derlying this sPier question, and to
that question wilt be obliged to
address ourstives hereafter."
Prof. Powers has made a special
study of sociology and taken a pe
culiar interest in it. He is of the
opinion that when sociology has
been as carefully studied as eco
nomics and has ripened into a well
digested science, it will rival eco
nomics in interest for the student.
Besides this, Prof. Powers believes
that economics will d rive a new
life from the study of sociology, for
it will open a new basis for eco
nomic development.
In time Prof. Powers hopes to
give a course in politics. During
the coming year he intends to com
plete a book on monetary problems.
The work has alreadv been begun.
