It is a very much discussed ques
tion among tennis pin vers of the
University why, in the general
reorganization of student hody af
fairs, tlur Tennis (Muh was not in
cluded in the Athletic Association.
Although temporarily giving way
to the more popular forms of ath
letics, such as football and track
athletics, tennis is yet an important
branch of sports, and it is hard to
-â– ce why its management was not
included under the one organiza
tion. As it is now, after plenty of
experience, the Tennis Club finds
itself too weak to stand successfully
ilone, and the interests of the game
must of necessity suffer. It would
">e a doubtful as well as a diflicult
'ask for the immediate members of
'he club to give to it their constant
aid and help, for the majority of
them have a great many other
filings to absorb their attention.
A hat the club needs is a powerful
organization like the student body
behind it, from which it can draw
as well as give its support. Tennis

is a recognized branch of our inter-1
collegiate athletics and as such
cannot he ignored; and the best
and surest way to increase its use
fulness and raise the standard of
excellence is to place it under the
immediate supervision of a body j
that can manage it successfully.
