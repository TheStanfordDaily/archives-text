The present is fraught with deep-1
est consequences for Stanford. The \
arguments in the appeal front j
Judge Ross's decision are closed, |
and the judges of 'he Circuit Court
of Appeals have the case under con-j
sideration. In the course of a week!
or two at most their decision will 1
be rendered. If it sustains that of
Judge Ross, we will have greater,
cause for rejoicing and parades and
fireworks than a thousand football ;
victories could furnish us. Such a 1
decision will increase to certainty
in us our belief that the Govern-!
ment's claim against the estate is
without legal support. We shall!
then be able calmly to wait for the!
final decision of tiie Supreme Court !
as a matter of formality, confident '
of the inipregnabiltiy of our position.
But an adverse decision in this j
court means months of doubt audi
gloom. If the former decision upon
the demurrer is reversed, the ease!
must then, as we understand it, reâ€¢ j
vert to the lower court and be tried!
in detail, this hearing in turn to be I
followed by two appeals and decis
ions before a final settlement is
reached.
For the reassurance of those fear
ful of the result ii may be said that
it is the general opinion of the mem
bers of the San Francisco bar that
the decision of Judge Ross has no
flaw and will be sustained. Again,
the hopelessness of the Govern
ment's claim may be inferred from |
the tone of McKisick's closing ef-j
fort. When a lawyer in a case
before learned judges throws aside
argument as to the law and justice I
and appeals to prejudice, plays
to the galleries, it is safe to infer j
that he no longer expects lo win a
decision and therefore speaks j
merely for effect with the people.
