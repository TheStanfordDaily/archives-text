The (-Impel was crowded to over
flowing List night with an audience
gathered to hear Dr. .Jordan's first
lecture for the present year. lie
made a new departure, and after
some prefatory remarks, gave ;t
reading of poems of the Civil War.
written for the most part not;
hy literary men hut by men of j
more <>r less active participation in
the war. thus representing the pulse !
of the common people of our
countrv during that 1 inie.
After the exciting event growing
out of-John Brown's raid and just
after the attack on Fort Sumter,
there appeared in Boston a poem
hv Franklin Lushington:
No more words;
Try it with your swords!
Try it with the arms of your brav
est. and your best!
You are proud of your manhood,
now put it to the test.
Not another word;
Trv it hy 1 he s'word!
* * * *
You t hat in I he front
Bear the battle's brunt. —
When the sun gleams at dawn on
the bayonets abreast ;
Remember 'tis for government and
country you contest;
For love of all you guard.
Stand, and strike hard!
There was a feeling prevalent
among the Southerners that they
in case of defeat would become
slaves, and hence the following
from .James Barron Hope.
Born free, thus we resolve to live:
By Heaven, we will be free!
Defiant let the banners fly,
Shake out their glories 1<> the air,
And, kneeling, brothers, let us
swea r
We will be free or die!
Then let the drums all roll!
Again, in .Maryland, James K.
Randall wrote:
The despot's heel is on thy shore,
Maryland !
His torch is at thy temple door,
Maryland !
Avenge the patriotic gore
That flecked the streets of Baltimore,
And be the battle queen <>f yore,
Maryland, my Maryland!
These poems reflect the feeling of
the early days of theconflict. And
in October, 1 «S(»1, .James Russell
Lowell, anticipating the life con
vulsion that was t<> follow, wrote a
beautiful poem, "Washers of the
Shroud," in many respects the
greatest of the poems of the war:
Along a river-side, I know not where,
I walked one night in mystery, of
dream ;
A chill creeps curdling yet beneath
my hair
To think what chanced me by the
pallid gleam
Of a inoon-wrealh that waned
through haunted air.
* * * *
Then all was silent, till there smote
my ea r
A movement in the stream that
checked my breath:
Was it the slow plash of a wading
deer?
But something said, "This water is
of Death ! ,
The Sisters wash a shroud iil
tfiing to hear."

I, looking then, beheld the ancient
three
Known to the Greeks and to the
Northman's creed,
That sit in shadow <>112 the mystic
tree,
Still crooning, as they weave their
endless hrede,
One song: "Time was, Time is, and
Time shall he."
In 1802, when the war was well
on and life was running red, there
came a " Dirge fora Soldier —in
memory of General Philip Kearny,"
written by George 11. Boker, begin
ning:
('lose his eyes, his work is done!
What to him is friend or foeman,
Rise of moon or set of sun,
Hand of man or kiss of woman?
Lay him low, lay him low,
In the clover or the snow !
What cares he? he can not know.
Lay him low.
The Northern armies in 1802
were badly beaten, partly because
the Northern generals fought with
one eye on the war and one on the
gallery —watching always for politi
cal preferment. This called forth a
poem from Edmund C. Stedman,
each verse of which ends with
"Abraham Lincoln, give us a man":
(live ns a man of God's own mould,
Born to marshal his fellow-men ;
One whose fame is not bought and
sold
At the stroke of a politician's pen;
(.Jive us the man of thousands ten,
Fit to do ;is well as to plan ;
(Jive us a rallving-cry, and then,
Abraham Lincoln, give us a man.
It is said that Lincoln read this
poem to his cabinet.
"The Bay Fight" was written by
Henry 11. Brownell in commemor
ation of the heroic squadron which
was employed in shutting off the
blockade runners about Key West:
Our ship and her fame today
Shall float on the storied stream
When mast and shroud have
crumbled away,
And her long white deck is a
dream.
After the war was over, the death
of the greatest Southern general,
Lee, whose hist words were " Let
the tent he struck. The general
has gone forward," was commem
orated by Margaret J. Preston in
" Gone Forward."
Yes, " Let the tent be struck": vic
torious morning
Through every crevice flashes in
a day
Magnificent beyond all earth's
adorning;
The night is over; wherefore
should we stay?
And wherefore should our voices
choke to say,
"The general 11; is gone -forward!"
