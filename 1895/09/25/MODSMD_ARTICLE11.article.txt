Students who recall the hit
made by the Stanford Band at the
big football game last year, and
who remember how highly our
band was complimented on many
occasions, are anxious to hear that
steps have been taken towards re
organization this semester.
Whatever is done must be done
speedily, fora band needs long, care
ful practice. That such an impor
tant college feature shall be dropped
from the list of our musical clubs
seems a decided, mistake. There
are a few good musicians who have
come to the front in previous years
when they were needed, and who
have made a success of the band.
They now have another opportu
nity for doing their alma mater a de
cided favor and they should not
hesitate.
