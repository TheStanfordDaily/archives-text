# From Lecture to Laboratory

Early hut spring a committee
consisting of Dr. It. Beverly Cole,
Prof. p. A. Beckett, and Architect
Albert Sutton, was sent on an
Kastcrn tour by the regents of the
t niversity of California. The
committee visited various institu
tions and noted recent improve
ments with a view to their adoption
in the plans of the new building for
t lie A Ihliated (Yd leges.
Dr. Cole in a recent interview,
speaking of changes he observed in
I',astern methods, said:
''We found, generally speaking,
that in teaching, the didactical
method, that is by lectures, is giv
ing way to classroom and labor
atory work.
''Take the law for instance. We
found that in the law school of
Columbia College in New York
they had only two lecture-rooms,
and tliev were more often used as
classrooms than for lectures. And
at Ann Arbor in lieu of lectures a
hypothetical case is tried before one
of the professors as judge. The
court is complete in every detail;
clerk, bailiff, etc. The senior stu
dents act asattorneyson either side
and witnesses are called,examined,
and cross-examined as in any trial,
and the students of the lower grades
sit without the rail as spectators
and take notes.
''In medicine, laboratory work is
made pre-eminent. In surgery
every operation is performed on the
cadaver, and the student's eye and
hand are taught equally with his
mind and eye. The physiological
laboratory is a veritable machine
shop, and in many places they em
ploy a machinist at a big salary to
make the instruments used in the
experiments.
''In pharmacy now microscopy
plays an important part. The
students watch the progress of the
plant from the seed to the perfect
flower the biology of the plant, if
you please. I n chemistry they view
every process of decomposition and
reconi posit ion of the various drugs,
and the analysisot every substance,
whether vegetable or mineral—yes,
or animal either —is successfully
performed in the laboratory. The
druggist of the future will have to
be immensely learned—as far in
advance of those we have now as
they are in advance of their pre
decessors of years ago."
