# Football Practice
## 
### 
There was no scrimmage practice
last night. Twenty or thirty men
appeared upon the field, but in all
that number there were so few cen
ter men that it was impossible to
form two elevens. As a con
sequence the time had to be de
voted to punting and gymnasium
work.
A noticeable fact at present is
that the majority of the players are
freshmen. The old men show a
decided reluctance to getting out.
This is a very bad state of affairs.
Berkeley has her coach and will go
into immediate training, thus gain
ing several weeks' advantage over
us. The management should do
everything in its power to induce
the veterans to go into training, for
it is upon them that we must de
pend to form the backbone of the
team.
So far, there has been a large
number of spectators on the field
each night. But the students will
not long be willing to stand in the
dust for an hour each night. Seats
should be provided, especially
for the ladies.
No particular improvement has
been shown in the playing. In
fact the men played better on the
first night than any night since.
The new field was sprinkled yes
terday, but as there was no line-up
it turned out to be unnecessary. It
is to be hoped that the manage
ment will not become discouraged
by this but will make an effort to
have the ground well watered each
da v.
