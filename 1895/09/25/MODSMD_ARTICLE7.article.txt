### 
Yesterday morning Berkeley
celebrated an event of no little ini
portance to lier and of almost equal
interest to Stanford. That event
was the arrival on her campus of
Frank S. Butterworth, who will
coach llie U. C. men for their big
! football game with Stanford.
Butterworth was met at the Kith
j street station in Oakland by Man
ager Lang and Captain Sherman
i who conducted them to the Berke
ley campus. Later in the day
Butterworth inspected the athletic
Held and made some suggestions
! for improving the football grounds
; that will tend to lessen the danger
!of injury to the players. When
I the coach lirst appeared on the
! gridiron with Captain Sherman he
was greeted with Yale's cry by the
500 students assembled to see the
first day's work.
There were twenty-seven men on
' hand anxious to hear football wis
. dom from the great Yale full-back.
Players were givch a half hour's
, exercise at line-work and falling on
; the ball under direction of the new
'trainer. Butterworth is said t<>
have been well pleased with the
appearance and the work of the
i men of whom he is to have charge.
'IWa reporter Butterworth said,
regarding his plans for the team,
! "The practice will necessarily be
i light at lirst, but it will not be long
before the men will he able to buckle
down to solid training. It may be
j found advisable to have the team
| do a certain omount of gymnasium
i work each day before going on the
field, but that will be determined
latter. Kicking and falling on the
I ball will be the order for the first
I three or four days,and then we will
! have the boys line up fora change.
I think it advisable to have the
training table set within about ten
days, when the training rules must
be obeyed in every detail. It will
be our purpose not to allow any of
the men to know whether they will
have a place on the varsity eleven
until the very last thing, so no one
can be said to have a cinch on any
position."
