A number of spectators braved
the heat and appeared upon the
football field last evening. They
were fully repaid for their trouble:
us the game proved decidedly in- j
teresting, from the onlooker's point j
of view at least. Of course the
playing was not up to Varsity j
form; nevertheless, the men put a|
great deal of vim into their work !
and made the game exciting.
The Held was a little less dusty:
than on the previous days, which j
goes to show that a judicious use
of the sprinkling cart is bound to!
have good results.
In the first part of the game, j
Dole made a splendid run of about j
forty yards and was neatly downed j
by Harris, a new man who showed .
that he at least understands the art |
of tackling. After this, Code's
team rushed the ball well into their j
opponents' territory, but failed to
make a touch-down. After a short
intermission, Plate's team took the
aggressive, and after continued line
bucking and several exciting scrim
mages at last made a touch-down.
This ended the practice.
I>. Thomas, Dole, and Overacker,
as halfbacks, did very well ; each
had at least one long run to his
credit at the end of the game.
Fickert, if he keeps up his good
work, will soon deserve Claude;
Downing's cognomen of "Old Re
liable." He keeps his head on his!
shoulders and is to be found in i
every play. Garten has proved!
himself no mean adversary for
Fickert. It is difficult to choose j
between Thomas and Harrington,
as opposing guards. On the other!
side of center, Lewers seems to out
class .James both in aggressive and
defensive work. The latter does 1
not understand the g:iine and fails'
to get down low enough in the line. |
Cotton and Rice at tackle did good
work. Pauly and Parker played |
opposite each other as ends and j
tackled in a very creditable man- j
ner. Weldon bucked the line fori
good gains last night. He is im-i
proving in this respect, although
he runs a little too high yet. Code
played quarter in his own style.'
His passing is very true. Plate
did well in his new position, but'
fumbles too much as yet.
The teams lined up as follows:
FIKST. SECOND.
