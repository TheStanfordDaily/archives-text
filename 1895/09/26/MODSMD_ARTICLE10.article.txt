Tiie attention of the Tennis
Club is called to the state of the
two courts to the south of the club
courts. The nets are down and
the edges grown up with weeds.
The condition upon which the Ten
nis (.Hub was given special priv
ileges on two courts was that it
should keep the other two in good
repair. This has not been done
and until it is done a member of
the Tennis Club cannot justly
claim precedence over non-mem
bers in the use of the''club courts."
