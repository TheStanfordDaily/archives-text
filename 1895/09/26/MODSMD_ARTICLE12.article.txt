Some of the professors in assign
ing daily work forget, apparently,
to consider the amount of time it
takes to accomplish the work they
assign. Four hours is far too
short a time to properly complete
the less'ons or reference reading re
quired for many of the daily reci
tations. It is impossible to
thoroughly master thirty or forty
pages in law or examine into ten
ora dozen cases, or read a hundred
pages of reference in history, inside
of the two hours that students are
supposed to allot in preparation
for each hour's recitation. If many
of the professors would remember
that siudents are generally taking
work in more than the course they
themselves teach, it is probable
that they would assign less work
hihl be repaid by more thoroughly
prepared recitations.
