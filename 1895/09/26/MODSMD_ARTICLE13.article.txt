are to he refused regular standing.
This rule appears harsh, but it is

certainly just. Specialization in
education is fraught with perils.
Not the least of these is the danger
lof narrowness growing out of the
lack of broad | reparation. Suppose,
for example, that a student who

academy wherein specialization
is carried to an extreme should

grammatical letter would be a poor
recommendation for Win alma ma lev.

point of view it seems that this
