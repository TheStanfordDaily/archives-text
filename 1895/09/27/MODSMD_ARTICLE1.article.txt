# Football Dust and Heat.
## 
### 
The warm weather seems to put |
an extra amount of lite into the
practice games. Last evening, as j
on the preceding day, the team;
put up a very interesting game.
Again the dust proved a detri
ment. It is impossible to follow I
the ball when the players are sur-;
rounded by a cloud of powdered;
earth. The worst feature of the!
poor field, though, is that the
players' lungs and nostrils become
tilled up, thus ruining their wind. Itj
would be far better to wet the lield
an hour before practice and play in I
the mud rather than to submit the'
pla vers to danger resulting from |
inhaling the dust.
Plate, Code, and Frankenheimer
each made repeated gains for long
distances. Weldon did some very
good line bucking. Cotton carried
the ball well into his opponents'
territory each time that he received
it. Fickert and Carton were the
opposing centers. It appears that
each is stronger on the aggressive
than the defensive. Bigelow was |
weak as guard. He played too far
from center and seemed entirely
unable to bold bis man. In this
way many of the passes were
spoiled. Leavitt made the best run
of the day and was cleverly
stopped by \\ ill Mcintosh.
