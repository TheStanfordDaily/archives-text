### 
It is ii satisfaction to Westerners
to know some of the inside facts in
regard to John V. Crum's defeat
hy Wefers. Our faith inCrumand
his exceptional sprinting abilities
is unshaken, even though he has
not finished tirst in the trial races
at New York. The treatment ac
corded him by the management at
Traverse Island was certainly dis
heartening, if not discourteous.
Trainer Mike. Murphy is also
hlanied for Crum's poor showing,
lie h:is evidently not forgotten the
sound heating his pet Yale sprint
ers received from the doughty
Western runner at the Eastern In
tercollegiate and does not mean to
exert himself to help Crum. Ihe
fact is. Crum strained a tendon in
his leg at the meet of the New .Jersey
Athletic Club, and was ordered to
Manhattan Field to compete in the
so-called trial races, notwithstand
ing his injury. I'ntil Mr. Wefers
under favorable —nay, fair condi
tions —succeeds in defeating the
lowa bov, we will stake our hopes
on John V. Crum ! —Scarlet and
