Complaint is being made against
those cyclers who persist in riding
on the wrong side of the road lead
ing to I'alo Alto. Last year, on ac
count of a number of collisions, it
was found necessary to restrict
riders to the east walk, and large
signs at both entrances of the road
announced the fact. This year the
signs have disappeared, and, these
gone, old riders seem to take for
granted that the restrictions have
been removed. New riders have
followed suit, and now the walk,
supposed to be reserved for pedes
trians, is crowded with wheels.
The same conditions which tirst
called forth this restriction still ex
ist. There are just as many people
who walk between the University
and i'alo Alto. Wheelmen are just
as liable to cause accidents today
as they were a year ago. It' cyclers
persist in infringing upon the rights
of pedestrians, the privilege of rid
ing on the walks will probably be
denied them altogether.
