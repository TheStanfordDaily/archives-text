Many people will doubtless hear
with something akin to wonder <>1
the long and dignified academic
traditions of the New England col
leges, and ot their weII-preserved
and lovingly cherished forms and
ceremonies, which do not yield in
interest and pieturesqueness to
those of our universities. The fact
is, we are too apt, when we think of
America, to consider it a new place.
We forget that the coast fringe of
the New England states had flour
ishing settlements 2.~>0 years ago.
We regard things that date from
Cromwellian times as sufficiently
venerable when we find them in
England. Why should we make
any (list met ion in the case of
America? lint in truth, it is rather
the Americans who are to blame
than we. It has become a con
ventional enthusiasm with them
to go to Oxford or Cambridge and
to declare indiscriminately in regard
to anythingand everything: "Alas!
we have nothing at all of this sort
in America.''
We in England have caught the
parrot crv, till at last it is a sort of
unchallengeable dogma that every
thing is brand new in America. The
old brick halls that enclose two
sides of the yard at Harvard, the
stately fascade of N'assua Hall at
Princeton, or the older blocks at
Yale, may not be architecturally as
magnificent as Wolsey's work at
Christ church. They belong to
an austerer epoch, and a less
artistic, society. Cnless, however,
the pictures in the work before
us give a strangely false im
pression. they must have a charm
of no mean kind. Hut in any case,
and that more than any brick and
mortar, the American universities
are seats of learning, alma maters,
that men can and do love. Wit
ness the yearly benefactions which
their sons, and not merely th >se
who arc millionaires, provide for
their greater glory. And the
American university can do more
than make her sons loyal to
her. She can inspire her chil
dren with a love of their
country, and a willingness to sacri
fice themselves for the welfare of
the State. It was no accident that
sent 1,200 Harvard men to light for
their country on the battle fields of
Virginia, and to beat down armed
rebellion; nor was it any idle fancy
that raised to the ninety-five who
fell in the good light a monument
to the very center of the life of the
university.
On the walls of Memorial Hall
are inscribed with the utmost sim
plicity the names of the men who
died for the I'nion, the dates of
birth and death, and the name of
the battle. That is all. But even
the perfect good taste and simplicity
is not without its significance.
A university does not succeed
unless it puts "breeding" and
gentlemanly feeling in the truest
sense into the character of those to
whom it is a nursing mother.
"Manners inaketh man' 1 is not the
monopoly of the Wykhaniists, but
belongs to every seat of true learn
ing. Harvard gave the "free and
gentle spirit" of the true knight,
both to those who fell and to those
who raised so worthy and touching
a monument. Let us hope and
trust, if ever our unity as a free
people were endangered, as was
that of the English beyond the sea,
the sons of our universities would
prove themselves to have learned as
worthily the greatest lesson that
man, the citizen, can learn—the
lesson of patriotism and of self
sacrilicc to a just and worthy end.
