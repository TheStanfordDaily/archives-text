Incandescent lights are to be
placed in groups of three at the
intersection of Alvaradoand Lasuen
streets, the crossing near Roble,one
on Lasuen street, and two each on
Alvarado and Salvatierra rows.
All that the householders have
done is to furnish the material and
the University has supplied them
with the men to put up the lights
and with power. The subscript ions
are entirely voluntary,and the peo
ple in every case have been glad to
respond.
The idea originated with Mr.
Woodworth of Lasuen street, and it
it due to his interest in the plan
that it has been made a success.
