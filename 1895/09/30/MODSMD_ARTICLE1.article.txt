# "AS YOU LIKE IT."
## To Be Reproduced on the Campus for the Benefit of the Junior Annual. 
### 
The manager of the '97 Annual
has in view that which doubtless |
will prove to be the greatest attrac
tion ever seen on the campus of)
Stanford University. This is I
nothing less than Mr. Friedlander'si
outdoor production of Shakspere'sl
"As You Like It," which about aj
week ago delighted the thousands'
who assembled on Mayor Sutro's'
lawn. The costumes, the entire
arrangement, and all but a very
few of the players will be the same.
It is impossible to obtain exactly
the same cast, but it is promised
that the one we do have will be
fully as good if not better than the
original. It has not been decided
just where the play will be pre
sented as there are so many ex
cellent places on the campus that
it is difficult to make the selection.
Both parties are desirous of giving
tiiis as soon as possible in order to
avoid any interference from thel
rainy season. Accordingly some
Saturday afternoon along the hit
ler part of October has been agreed j
upon. Mr. Friedlander says that i
he has been asked by many parties
and organizations to present "As 1
You Like It" again in the city but
that he has refused them all. In j
fact this is about the only placet
which he is willing to favor with aj
second performance.
While the manager of the An
nual feels confident that enough
tickets will be sold to pay the ex
penses for the professional actors,
for railroad fare, etc., yet Mr. Freid
lander must have something more!
definite as security before he can be i
induced to come down to I'aloAlto. j
The only way to bring this about isj
to obtain a list of those who will in
all probability desire to secure
tickets. Reserved seats will be sold
for one dollar, which is only about
one half the price charged in the
city. At this rate the sale of four
or five hundred tickets will need to
be assured. Accordingly ten or
twelve persons will be asked to se
cure names, and it is hoped that
every one will be willing to signify!
his intention to he present and thus I
bring a great entertainment to the!
University and at the same time |
materiallv assist the Annual.
