League in recommending that the
preliminary debates take place this

able. In all former debates our

versity. It is impossible that they
should have been ; to prepare for
two debates in one semester is en
tirely too much to ask of one man.
If, on the other hand,our represen
tatives are chosen before Christmas,
they will have the whole vacation
of two weeks in which to begin the
preparation. If Berkeley's co-oper
ation is secured, and there is no
cause known at present why it can
not be, the standard of the Inter
collegiate Debate can be materially
raised by such action.
