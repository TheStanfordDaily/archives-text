It is about time that the driving
<»112 carriages on the football field
should be prohibited. Not only
does the driving of teams on the
old diamond cut the ground up in
a serious manner, but the buses and
vehicles of all sorts, standing about
the grounds, interfere with the
game. Only last Friday one of the
halfbacks ran into a carriage and
was somewhat hurt, while another
narrowly escaped severe injury.
Kach day it becomes more ap
parent that the sooner drivers are

given directions us to where tlieyj
may stand their teams the better!
it will be for players and spectators!
alike. This brings to mind the
fact that the football management
would do well to put up fencing of j
some sort, separating the football j
field from the surrounding grounds, i
It is going to be impossible for the j
{•layers to do anything when closed |
in by interested students, and fori
the progress of the men it would be
a wise move to put up the fencing
without delay.
