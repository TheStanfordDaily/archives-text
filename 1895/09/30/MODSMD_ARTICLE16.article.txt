The game on Friday, like those
of the few days preceding, was
exciting and therefore interesting.
There was a good-sized crowd out
and considerable enthusiasm was
shown.
it was late on Saturday before
there was a sufficient number of
men on the field t<Â» form two teams.
About ~>:80 the line-up was formed.
The lines were made up almost
entirely *>112 new and light men.
Carle was out for the first time this
season. He played center against
(iarton but did not show himself
an equal to his sturdy opponent.
Will Mcintosh played quarter on
the victorious side while Ilolbrook
gave the signals on the other side.
B. Thomas as halfback on Mc
intosh's side showed that he has the
characteristics of a good football
man and should, with practice, de
velop into a first-class player.
The "dust nuisance" will un
doubtedly be abated. We have the
promise of the management that
the field will be sprinkled every
dav hereafter.
