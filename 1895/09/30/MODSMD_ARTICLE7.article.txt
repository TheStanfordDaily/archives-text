# Yesterday's Sermon.
## 
### 
The Rev. Dr. Tenney of San .Jose
delivered the Sunday morning
sermon in chapel. Jle said in part
as follows:
"Love not the world, neither the
things that are in the world. If
any man love the world, the love of
the Father is not in him." And
yet we are taught that God created
the world, that after each epoch of
creation he pronounced what he
had made as good; shall we not,
therefore, love what God has
made?
It is certainly not this material
world that we are commanded not
to love. We helieve that it is one
of the expressions of God himself,
the crystallization in the material
things of 11 is thought, yes more,
that the life in it is an impartation
of God's life. It is incumbent upon j
us to read God through His mate
rial world. We rejoice that the be
lief of God's having made the world
and then gone off leaving it running
as we would leave a machine run,
does not now obtain.
But wedo believe that the beauties
about us are expressive of the
deeper spiritual life about us; and
that life is not spiritual that does
not find more and more of beauty
in this material world. And so we
come back after reading all our
books to this one great volume,
that is forever inexliaustable, and
from it there comes to lis through
the brilliant morning, the singing
of birds, the swerving sea, and the
struggle of the elements, a new and
ever deepening meaning.
Again, we are not tafight to hate
the world of men and women; it
was certainly Christ's mission to
save, not a select company in the
world, but the whole wide
world —to bring about that about
which the poets have dreamed. The
healthy life, therefore, loves men
and women the more, and leaves its
childish prattle; it goes without re
striction out among men, and finds
sympathy in ihe struggles of the
lowest as well as in the aspirations
of the highest; and the more sym
metrical our development, the more
we will love all men.
There has been a sort of belief
that we should separate worldly
occupations and religious life; but
it is one of the good signs of the
times that the old distinction be
tween the secular and the religious
is being broken down, and that
man's worldly occupation is becom
ing the chief avenue in which he
expresses his loyalty to spiritual
things —a sign that God's world is
being more clearly apprehended.
Now, although wisdom may some
times so dictate, yet it is, it seems
to me, very cheap, and sometimes
selfish also, to taboo certain amuse
ments as worldly. If we hedge
one about and say, " You must not
leave that enclosure," there grows
up by and by a distrust in us. for
the attitude toward these things
must alter with increased age ami
change of environment. It is not
the flesh, but the lust of the flesh,
that should be condemned —that
sort of desire which says, I must
have this thing now. whatever hap
pens ! Lust which longs for every
expression of the beautiful, for line
surroundings, wealth and luxury —
this is the part of the world which

i lilins the horizon of our life so that
I we can see nothing beyond.
Again, it is the choice of the
j outer good which is condemned,
i Man's life consisteth not of the
things which he possesseth. While
iwe are striving to gratify these
j outer desires we are neglecting the
I inward self, which, under right
conditions, ever reaches out into
1 the everlasting beyond.
Another trouble is that we love
I ourselves instead of others, thus
J again illustrating the vain spirit of
j the world. Truly, we should love
! ourselves in a certain measure, but
i we should love others as ourselves,
j 1 row many have come to their
i position, not by lending a helping
j hand to the helpless, but by center
| ing every effort upon their own per-
I sonal ambitions, using as their
! stepping stones the deaths of others.
Thank (iod that not only the so
called religion but the world of
science and philosophy concerning
! the relations of men is now proving
i the fallacy of all this; proving that
| the man who lives for his own
| possessions cannot live nobly; that
I society itself is committing suicide
j bv going to the extremes of this
selfish age. And men are begin
ning to say: I have no wealth
I can own for myself and monopo
lize for my own possession; 1 will
employ it as a help to others.
Hut, it may be rejoined, as a
! matter of fact, we do not really love
ourselves, and we are paying the
penalty of this mistake; and there
fore let us begin to love the Father
more. Let me put it the other way:
first love the Father, and then no
j difficulty will result from excessive
love of the world. With this atti
tude of love, all the'things of the
world will more and more minister
to our present as well as our
eternal welfare.
