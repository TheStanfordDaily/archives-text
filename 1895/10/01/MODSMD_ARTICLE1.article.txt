# How the Co-Op. Is Run.
## 
### 
The work of supplying a great
university with books is more com
plicated than the casual observer
would take it to he. A student sel
dom decides very far in advance
just what work he will take up for
a given semester, or if he does, no
one but himself knows what classes
he will enter. Even the professor
in charge can have«but a faint idea
of how large a certain class will be,
two days before it is organized.
Without large profits it would be
very disastrous for private parties
if they should guess at the
number of books likely to be re
quired in each course in the Uni
versity and make purchases accord
ingly. Of some they would have
too few ; of others they would have
an over supply. The profits on the
books they did sell would of neces
sity be large enough to pay for the
idle stock left on the shelves.
The professors and students have
surmounted this difficulty by or
ganizing the behind Stanford .Jr.
I diversity Co-Operative Associa
tion. At the time of the organiza
tion of the Co-Op., December, 1891,
there was much difficulty in getting
books in Palo Alto and in the city,
and the purpose of its promoters
was to bring about a more satis
factory arrangement by buying
books from publishers and jobbers
and selling them to members at
cost.
The capital stock of this com
pany is $25,000, in shares of two
dollars and fifty cents each. Any
professor or student of the Univer
sity is eligible to membership and
may remain a member as long as
the share of stock is held. The
shares are transferable at anytime.
Those leaving may deposit their
shares with the manager and these
are taken from the file in order and
reissued to new members. A fee of
fifty cents is charged for this ser
vice. Those finding their own pur
chasers are charged ten cents for
the transfer on the books of the
company.
The shareholders meet in May of
each year to elect a board of nine
directors; the directors then meet
and choose their officers and the
manager for the coming year. The
present board is composed of the
following: F. B. Wooten, pres.,
Prof. Brun, Prof. Marx, E. E. Far
mer, George Crothers, F. L. Entler,
B. 1). W'igle, Miss Anna Koliler,
and Mrs. Flora Hartley Green.
The business manager is elected
by the board of directors and his
salary is fixed by the board. He
is placed under bond for $3,000,
his accounts and transactions are
open to the inspection of the board
at any time, and he is required to
make a report to the board once a
semester or oftener. The profits
do not go to the manager and it is
not to his advantage to keep up
prices.
There are to be no dividends.
The paid-up stock furnishes the
necessary capital and the books are
sold enough in advance of the cost
price to pay running expenses, but
no more. Thus the only profits to
the share-holder are the sums
saved on all purchases, which
usually make a very high rate of
interest on the investment after all.
To those who do not care to take

stock in the company, cards of
yearly membership are issued which
carry with them the privileges of
all discounts. The holders of these
are not shareholders or voters.
Persons not members are privi
leged to buy books through the Co-
Op., but they are charged about
ten per cent, more than members.
This throws a part of the burden
on non-members. By means of the
Co-Op. non-members get books
from five to fifteen percent.cheaper
than through outside firms. To
members the saving is from ten to
thirty per cent.
The present financial condition
of. the Co-Op. is very encouraging.
By the end of this week, the As
sociation will not owe a dollar.
Almost 800 of the shares have been
issued. The capital is represented
by the stock of books now on hand.
Every student should be interested
in the success of the Co-Op., and to
all appearance, every student is.
