It is a cause of great discomfort
to members of classes, especially to
those of the language departments,
to have students in translating
speak so low that they cannot be
heard more than two feet away,
thus depriving all hut those who are
within that fortunate radius, of the
benefits of the recitation. The
class work of the individual forms
an important part of the daily
recitation, and no person should at
any time keep from the others what
he may have to contribute to the
subject by speaking so inaudibly
that he cannot be heard.
