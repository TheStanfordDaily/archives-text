The new method of boarding
students at the dormitories has
thus far proved a decided success.
Fare is much better and the service
greatly exceeds that of last year.
The result has been that the dormi
tories are gradually filling up with
students and the number of stu
dents now domiciled therein is
greater than for several semesters
past. There seems to be a tendency
of late to reduce the grade of board
somewhat. It is to be hoped that
there is no such intention on the
part of the caterer, who is appar
ently too shrewd a business man to
make the mistake that such a
policy would be.

Since the announcement in yes
terday's issue of the proposed open
air presentation of "As You Like
It"in a suitable part of the Uni
versity grounds some have said
that at the price of admission con
templated it cannot he made a sue- j
cess—that the necessary guarantee |
of the sale of tickets cannot he se-j
cured. Many jump at the idea
that it is to he played by local tal
ent and these consider the price
exorbitant.
But when the fact that the cast
is entirely professional is considered
a different light is thrown upon
the enterprise. Not only is the
cast to be entirely professional but
it will include the very best artists
now on the Coast. The people,
costumes, and stage accessories will
be ■ essentially the same as seen
upon Sutro's lawn. One dollar is
not at all exorbitant for such a
production. It would be paid at a
theater door without a murmer.
Stanford people are under the
necessity of adding always to the
price of admission twice as much
more for railroad and street-car
fare. Why should they croak
when it is proposed to give the
romantic scenes of "As You Like
It" here at home in the open air
with nature's scenery? It can be
made the event of the semester,
one that will attract people by the
hundreds from the towns near and
even from the city. As an adver
tisement merely it should receive
unanimous support.
The immediate aid the individual
student can give is to sign his name
to the lists that will be started.
By this act he will indicate his own
favorable attitude towards the
scheme, and if the total result is
satisfactory final arrangements will
be made at once.
