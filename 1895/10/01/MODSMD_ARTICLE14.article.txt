# For Reconciliation.
## 
### 
It is obvious that the time has
come for an arrangement of the
grievances which have led to the
unfortunate dissension between
Harvard and Vale in regard to
athletics. The spectacle of two
great colleges which have long held
as sacred the settlement of athletic
supremacy, divided because of the
offense taken by one at unestab
-1 ishecl charges of unfair play pre
ferred by the other, would be ridic
ulous if it did not signify a well de
fined breach like the one now exist
ing. The reluctance of both sides
to descend from their high stand is
discreditable to themselves and un
just to the great body of graduates
and undergraduates who value a
Harvard-Yale match as the one
thing for which the training of the
teams is desirable.
There is a marked distinction to
be made between the justice of the
two conflicting causes. Yale took'
the initiative in raising the stand
ard of dissension. Her charges,
based chiefly upon idle rumor, were
superfluous, to say the least, and
hence it is rather an anomolous
position to put herself in, to de
mand an apology from Harvard.
An honorable retraction of these
trivial accusations would do much
to clear the atmosphere of inter
collegiate athletics and would prob
ably pave the way to a Harvard-
Yale football match. â€” Harvard
