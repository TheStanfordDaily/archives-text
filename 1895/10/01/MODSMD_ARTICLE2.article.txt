In all probability there will be a
football game between Vale and
Harvard this fall. The trouble be
tween the colleges has been partly
smoothed over, and the Vale men
are now desirous fora game.
It is a constantly recurring com
ment among college men that di
vinity students are the roughest
among football men, and that they
work off all their meanness on the
gridiron.
Most of the football teams of the
East have lost their old and best
players. Only two of Yale's eleven
have returned to college, Thome at
fullback, and Murphy at tackle.
Harvard is strong only behind the
line and Princeton must draw al
most an entirely new team. The
hitter college intends to adopt a
more conservative policy in regard
to training and finance than was
in vogue last year.
