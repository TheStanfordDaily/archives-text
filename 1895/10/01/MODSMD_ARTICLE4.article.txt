The report is as complete as it is
possible to make it at this time.
One item of expense not accounted
for in this report is the bill of Mr.
Downing for services in laying out
the football field. The bill is not in
my possession and has not been
presented.
There is also a bill of goods from
E. T. Allen tfc Co. which has not
yet reached me; it is one of no
great consequence, however. It
will be seen that the manager, Mr.
Eaton, has overdrawn his monthly
allowance to the amount of $30.
This will be noted in the October
allowance and report.
There are still a few dollars in
the hands of the assessment col
lectors which will go over on the
October account. In estimating the
receipts, expenditures, and liabil
ities the old outstanding accounts
have not been considered. Our
debts carried over from last year
will aggregate approximately $2000.
As provided by the constitution, I
may say that the vouchers and
books of the association are open to
all, where the minor details of the
expenditures may be seen.
