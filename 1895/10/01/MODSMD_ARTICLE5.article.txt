# With the Tacklers.

### 
Today we are able to look back
over ten days' scrimmage practice.
The playing shows no marked im
provement over that of the twenti
eth of September, when the two
teams lined up for the lirst time
this season. There has been no
real coaching and no real training.
The work so far has been that of
twenty-two individuals with the
same end in mind but with entirely
different ideas of how that end
should be attained. A successful
football team is a unit —not a band
of individuals. This unity can be
acquired only by hard work and
careful coaching. The longer a
team plays in the loose manner in
which our team has been playing,
the longer it will take the coach t.»
develop the proper team work.
Therefore, our coach should havo
been here for the lirst line-up. As
this seems to have been impossible,
it would seem advisable that two or
three of our veteran players should
be chosen to drill the men in sys
tematic team work until the coach
arrives.
If we can judge from last night's
game, we shall be open tocongratu

lations on Thanksgiving evening*
The playing was quick and hard,
the lines were heavy and the hacks
strong.
Jack Reynolds was out for the
first time, and though not up to
his old time form, showed that he
had not entirely forgotten what he
had learned on Woodside meadow.
Frankenheimer made some good
gains around the ends but was not
given an opportunity to show his
strong point. It is in line-lmcking
that .1111e shines. Campbell failed
to make an opening at right tackle
several times when he should have
done so. \V. Mcintosh tackled
well, although he is too light and
did not understand the position of
end well enough to break up the
interference. B. Thomas did good
work both in ground gaining and
tackling. Both Code and Holbrook
played steady games. Pauly
showed a disposition to shirk. His
work, this year, is not up to his
last year's mark. At one stage of
the game there was a great deal of
punting. This was of rather an
inferior order and only served to
wear out the men who followed the
ball.
Capt. Cochran desires that the
men should be more prompt in
coming out. This applies particu
larly to the old men, as the new
men are generally on hand, lie
wishes the players to be on the field
by four thirty in order to line up at
five.
Beginning tomorrow, the Fresh
man candidates will assemble at
four o'clock to practice for the
Freshman-U. C. game.
