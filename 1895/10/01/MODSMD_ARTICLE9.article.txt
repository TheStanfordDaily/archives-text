The efforts which certain stu
dents are making to give a grand
combination concert composed en
tirely of Stanford talent in San
Francisco Thanksgiving night, are
very commendable and should meet
with deserved success. A repre
sentative production such as this is
the only one of its kind that would
meet with general approval, and ii
sure to be a success both artist
ically and financially.
That there is more football en
thusiasm than ever in college this
year is shown from the fact that
games have already been arranged
between the different class teams,
which lias created a great deal of
rivalry among the players. Even
as early as next Saturday a
game is talked of between '97 and
'99, both of whose teams are well
organized. It is to be hoped that it
will be played on that date, for the
freshmen need all the exercise they
can get for their final contest with
Berkeley, and that as soon as pos
sible.
