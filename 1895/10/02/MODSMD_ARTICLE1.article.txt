# The 						Limits of Evolution,

### 
Professor (Seorge II. Ilowison i»f {
t he I * 11i versity of CJa lifornia lectured i
in the chapel yesterday evening on
"The Limits of Involution." The!
substa nee of the led lire, omitting the
introductory remarks, is reproduced j
in tiie following outline:
Those who avow what is called]
the Philosophy of Involution are;
themselves perhaps the most strin
gent deniers that evolution lias noi
limits. ()n the contrary, its limits,
they say, are rigid and absolute;]
it reigns only in the lield of the.
phenoniona —in the two-fold world j
observed by sense: the outer or
physical world of the external j
senses, and the inner or psychical;
world open to mental experience,!
otherwise called inner sense. To!
this philosophy, deserving of thci
name, at once gives its consent and j
authority. The dispute begins |
when the school of evolution goes
on to declare that the Reality be
yond phenomena, which they are
stringent in maintaining to exist of |
an immutable datum of conscious- 1
ness, must be designated perma
nently as theUnknown;and that,too, j
on the ground that nothing deserv-1
ing the name of knowledge is at- 1
tamable by any other method than
that of sensible experience, the
method of natural science. To this
historical philosophy rightly de
murs, as involving at once a pelitio j
and a self-contradiction. It is here
that evolution, as a principle of
philosophy, iinds its first limit.
Our second query is whether evo
lution is validly continuous even |
within the universe of phenomena;!
it ai once becomes evident that it
cannot be made so without under-!
going a change of moaning in kind. |
Biological evolution, the only evo-j
1 ill it >n known to science, means not
merely logical community, or re-]
semblance to observation and ;
thought, but likeness to kindred,!
likeness due to descent and birth.'
It is therefore directly dependent j
on generation by reproduction, and
loses its meaning when we pass the
boundaries o' the organic or living j
world. There is no way of bridg-j
ing the chasm between the Inor
ganic and the Organic in terms of
sensible experience, except by the'
hypothesis of "spontaneous gener
ation." whatever that handy phrase;
may mean; a phrase that historic
philosophy and recent science alike
stigmatize in its true nature by
correctly designating it as </(nrrali<>
i vara, and showing that all the
indications of the most careful
biology are steadily more and more
against the assumption which it
covers. Here evolution, as a prin
ciple of philosophy, finds its second
limit.
Put. on the other hand, the recog
nition of a logical or descriptive re
semblance, and progress of con
tinued resemblance, among all
parts of the Inorganic world, and
between the parts of the Inorganic
and the Organic too, is irressitible.
Kxplanation of this is imperative.
It cannot mean literal descent:
cannot be bv generation through
sap or through blood. What can il
mean? I nexplicability by any
thing merely sensible here shows
up plainly; and we thus get tor
evolution as a philosophical prin
ciple its third limit.

This is recognized by evolutional
philosophy, in its fundamental as
sumption of an Omnipresent
Energy whose nature it declares in
scrutable. This means, that the
universal phenomenal resemblance,
the mysterious kinship of the In
organic and the Organic, as neces
sarily referred to some hyperphe
nomenal or noumenal Cause which
is nevertheless unknown, must be
accepted as a dead and voiceless
fact —a "final inexplicahility," as
Stuart Mill used to say. But
surely philosophy means explana
tion, or else is not philosophy; and
surely you cannot explain by a
"final inexplicit bility." While,
therefore, philosophy goes along
with Mr. Spencer and his school
thus far, it declines to arrest its
progress with them here, and pro
nounces that in the Something,
still to be explained, but by evolut
ional philosophy confessedly inex
plicable, evolution, as a philosoph
ical principle, finds its last and
fatal reach in its fourth limit.
And now, 1 think, we are able to
show what the real nature of this
limiting being is, called correctly
enough, for the nonce, the Omni
present Energy. This becomes ap
parent when we analyze the con
ception, Evolution, and observe
what the essential conditions of its
possibility are, if it is to be con
strued as a real principle as wide
as the phenomenal universe. These
are:
1. Time and Space, as the proxi
mate but indispensable condition of
that succession and contiguity with
out which the serialily in evolution
cannot he I bought.
2. Natural causation, whether in
physical or in psychical succession
— that connection between phe
nomena which evolutional philoso
phy, with its dogma of the final suf
ficiency of merely scientific method,
consistently interprets into mere
historical regularity, but which has
to be more exactly interpreted into
a necessary and irreversible succes
sion, in order to the operation of
scientific method ilself.
3. Progression,or continually as
cending change, the vital concep
tion in universal evolution.
4. Logical unity; including des
criptive or objective resemblance,
continuity despite objective differ
ence, and thence "derivation."
5. Truth, Beauty, Love, undenied
human ideals, the principles of
philosophic, aesthetic, and moral
consciousness, as the indispensable
presuppositions without which the
judgment of progress, on which the
concept Evolution wholly rests,
would be impossible.
With this analysis in mind, we
now move forward to the inevitable
conclusion that the proximate bond
in evolution, the secret nexus in the
lack of which it would be impos
sible, lies in the spiritual nature of
man himself. it will appear,
clearly, that all these elements —
Time, Space, Causation, and, mani
festly, Logical Unity, and pre-emi
nently, the three Ideals, and, most
of all, among these the Moral Ideal
arc wholly unaccountable for by
means of evolution, but, on the con
trary, are all the absolute prere
quisites for its reality as well as for
its conception. Lut it is just the
active originating unitv of think

ing these that make up the essen
tial, the characteristic nature of
man. Evolution therefore itself
(not merely evolution a 1 philosophy)
in finding its proximate source and
footing in human nature, find there
its final limit. We thus come to
the proof that all we must dis
tinctively mean by man is not, and
cannot he, the result of evolution.
Man is not the offspring of Na
ture, but, rather, Nature is in a
great sense the offspring of human
nature. That Nature cannot be
wholly referred to men, that some
still more universal form of the ex
istence of that human nature is re
quired for her being, is not to be
denied when our psychology is as
exact and all-recognizing as it
should be. Such a psychology
recognizes a limit in human ex
perience which points to the co
operation with men of some nou
menal being other than they. But |
once the conditioning relation gets
shown to exist from man toward
Nature as the scene of evolution;
once it gets seen clearly, as Huxley,
the protagonist of evolution, at
last came so clearly to see and to
proclaim, that, in Conscience at
least, man has that which no cos
mic process can possibly account
for, and to which the cosmic pro
cess presents an aspect of real an
tagonism ; then our way is plain
toward determining the Absolute
Reality as of this lofty human na
ture too, only in its ideal perfec
tion, and we have found the way
to this demonstration of God.
