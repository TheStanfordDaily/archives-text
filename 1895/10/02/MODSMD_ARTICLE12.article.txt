It is safe to say th;tt of the three
eminent professors of philosophy
who have recently lectured in the
chapel Prof. Howison undoubtedly
carried off the palm as far as the
respect and admiration of the aud
ience is concerned. This was partly
due to the elegance, purity, and force
of his diction, the logic of his reas
oning, and his clean-cut delivery.
Hut to a larger degree it was due to
the fact that he gave ns philosophy.
When a philosopher comes to us
we have a right to demand that he
shall give us what he can of his
hest thought and not disappoint us
with a discourse on abnormal psy
chological phenomena, or again
with pedantic views of contempo
rary politics and social life. Prof.
Howison went straight into the
depths of one of the deepest of sub
jects, and in spite of the fact that
the lecture considerably overran the
time allotted to it, thereby causing
some uneasiness to a few unsophis
ticated freshmen, it was without
doubt the best received of any of
our recent lectures.
