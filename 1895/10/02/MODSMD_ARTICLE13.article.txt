How it is possible fora large
number of students to claim that
they are anxious for Stanford to
win the next intercollegiate foot
ball match is a mystery, since they

are, apparently, not enough inter
ested to pay the small assessment
levied. Out of nearly a thousand
students scarcely one hundred have
paid, and as a result the manage
ment is hampered.
Never before has the football en
thusiasm called out so many play
ers ; nor have Stanford's prospects
appeared so bright in many sea
sons. Yet now, at the very outset,
the mass of students, on whom the
preliminary expenses must of neces
sity fall, delay in their payments.
Such action is extremely short
sighted and selfish. The finances
were never in better hands, nor
have expenditures ever been more
judiciously made. No one can
charge the present management
with extravagance. Indeed, some
criticism on the other side is heard.
Everyday on the side lines cutting
remarks are made because this
thing and that thing has not been
done. The bald truth of the mat
ter is simply that the management
has no money and can do little
without it. Every student should
promptly do his duty to the team
by paying the assessment.
