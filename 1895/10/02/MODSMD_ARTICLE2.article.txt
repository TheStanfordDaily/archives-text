# Sophomore-Freshman Reception.
## 
### 
The reception which the Sopho-1
mores are planning to tender the!
Freshmen will ta-ke place Satur-!
day night in Encina gymnasium.
The doors will open at 7:30, and a
general good time is assured all
who attend. The affair is to be en
tirely informal in character. A
large committee has been formed, so
that no one may feel that he does
not know everybody else when the!
reception is over. Light refresh-1
inents will be served and a pleasure- [
able evening is in prospect. Each !
young lady who is a member of *98 |
or' 99 can have the* privilege of
bringing with her a lady friend.
As the entertainment is to be in
formal in every respect, this year's i
reception will probably mark a |
change in such functions.
