The goal posts are being put in
place on the new lield. The next
steps to be taken by the manage
ment should be to line off the grid
iron and provide seals for the spec
tators. These things should be at
tended to at once.
There were several narrow escapes
j from broken heads last night as a
i result of bicycles, benches, and
| other articles being left inside the
| lines. The onlookers do not seem to
j be satisfied with impeding theprac-
I tice by crowding upon the lield,
but must also leave their bicycles
and benches in dangerous proxim
ity to the players.
The Freshmen turned out in full
I force at four o'clock to practice sig
nals. The backs seemed strong
but the line is very light.
At five o'clock the first and
J second teams lined up and prac
ticed for nearly an hour. The
play was of the dashing order and
at some stages almost brilliant.
Marry Reynolds was out for the
first time and played a strong game.
Dole, Spaulding, and Franken
heinier made some excellent gains,
j Cochran played his old posit ion for
j awhile and played it as Cochran
j always plays. Rice and Campbell
| also did well at tackle. The latter
j did especially well when his lame
J shoulder is taken into consider
; ation. Carle held Garton better
! than he has heretofore. Smith and
' Pauly put up the best game at end.
j \V. Mcintosh played quarter and
did some remarkably good tack
! ling.
The men should remember that
no advantage is to be gained by
i off-side playing and holding in line,
j even if the umpire does not detect
j it, in practice. Stanford's record
j against Berkeley might have been
I even more brilliant than it is now
had it not been that some of her
players acquired just such habits as
' some men are now fast gaining.
