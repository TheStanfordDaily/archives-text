# Football Practice.

### 
The management is to be praised
for the condition in which they
have placed the field. The ground
itself was almost perfect yesterday.
It was just soft enough to prevent
injury to the players without being
soft enough to form an impedi
ment to fast running. The men
were able to take long breaths of
pure air, unpolluted with red dust,
for the Held had been well watered
and harrowed.
Each night finds a large crowd
of spectators on the field. \\ ill)
two or three hundred persons on
the side lines it is natural to ex
pect a little enthusiasm expressed
audibly. The Stanford yell, given
a few times during the game, would
not be amiss. The spectators seem
to appreciate the ludicrous points
far more keenly than the good
playing. Surely no Stanford stu
dent would confess that he has not
sufficient knowledge of football to
know a star play when he sees it.
It is only right, then, when such
plays are made, to cheer the player
—he needs all the encouragement
that can be given him.
All our veterans have now shown
their intention to try for this year's
team. Field held back as long as
possible, but at last decided to fol
low the example of his fellow
Woodsiders, and last night ap
peared on the gridiron, lie played
tackle, but as he does not under
stand the position, failed to make
any great showing.
Harry Reynolds, who gave good
promise as a half as long as he
played last year, donned a suit last
night for the first time this season.
To judge from his work at fullback
he stands an excellent chance for
that position on the Varsity. His
punting surpassed anything seen
in this season's practice. To be
sure be lacks form in his kicking,
but that will come with practice
and coaching. Apropos of punt
ing, the licrkileymi has this to say
of Ibitterworth's method:
'•The new style of kicking is very
interesting and valuable to new
men. It is not the idea of the
coach to change a man's method, if
his execution is already first class.
IJnt the high side swing of the leg
is undoubtedly superior to any
used on the Coast before, and all
backs, with the exception of per
haps one man, should endeavor to
perfect themselves in this mode.''

thestraight arm to great advantage
yesterday. Charlie Frazier was
out and played well at fullback.
Cochran played tackle fora while
and did well.

The Freshmen failed to practice
signals yesterday because there
were not a sufficient number of
men out. This shows a poor spirit
and should be remedied at once.
The Class of '99 should take warn
ing from '98's experience and elect
a captain immediately to get the
men out and put them into train
ins.
