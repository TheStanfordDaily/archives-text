The "beat" in this morning's
full on the subject of our football
coach is only a pretense. If the
reader goes beyond the head-lines
he finds that no one has yet an
nounced the name of our coach and
that the article itself contains noth
ing new. As far as authority is
concerned it might as well have
been written from Berkeley where
the feeling prevails that Camp is to
be the man as from here where the
prevalence of the same feeling was
the source of the article.
The football management has
not announced the name of the
coach and has good reasons for re
fusing for the present to do so.
