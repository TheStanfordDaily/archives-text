At t be beginning of debating ;ic
tivities for the present year the
question raised by {Senator Perkins'
gift to the University debaters again

| confronts us. This offer was made
in nil good faith and with coin
niendahle generosity, and in a way
lit will he potent for good. To begin
! with, it will attract public atten
tion. The newspapers on this Coast
| have generally used two pages of
space on athletics to less than a
| column on intercollegiate debates.
The debates have been, outside
those most directly interested, little
known and less cared about. Now
the circumstances under which this
j gift was made and the connection
| with Senator Perkins' name will
surely catch public attention.
Again, there will he an increasing
interest among the students. The
debates will seem doubly worth try
ing for, and it is not likely that
some of our strongest men will con
tinue to hold aloof from these coo
tests. It seems a pity that college
men should need to be offered prizes
jas an inducement, but it is never
theless true that there will he a
! strong interest generated by this of
' fer.
On the other hand, there is a
great danger possible under the
conditions proposed. Everyone
knows that "team work" is as im
portant in debating as in football.
Three men, acting separately, can
never win a debate of this kind.
There must be a division of argu
ments and of topics, a placing of
each man where he will do the most
good, a general "backing up" of
each speaker by his colleagues.
With a prize offered for the best
speaker,a system of this kind could
never be brought to perfection.
While the glory of winning such a
prize danced before his eyes, each
speaker would, consciously or un
consciously, work for brilliance of
individual argument.
The recommendation of the in
ter-Societv Debating League is,
therefore, a good one. It has de
cided that it would be advisable to
divide the prize between the three
men who win places on the debate,
thus gaining all the advantages of
the offer without its drawbacks. It
is to be hoped that Senator Perkins
will consent to such an arrange
ment.
