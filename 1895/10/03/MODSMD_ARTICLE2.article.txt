# Inter-Class Games.
## 
### 
The schedule for the inter-class
games has been made out by the
respective captains, and is as fol
lows:
Saturday, Oct. 5, '98 vs. '97.
Tuesday, Oct. 8, '96 vs. '97.
The teams winning in these two
games will play the final game on
Saturday, Oct. IU. It is hardly
possible that there can be any more
than these, as the management will
insist on having no games after
Oct. 15.
