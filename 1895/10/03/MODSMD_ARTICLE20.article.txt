### 
Miss Elsa Von Mauterseheid of
San Rafael gave a piano recital last
evening to a small party of friends
at the home of Prof. Hussey on Al
varado Row. Her playing is of a
high order and was greatly enjoyed
by those present. Miss Von Mau
terseheid is to be given a benefit in
San Francisco in November under
the auspices of the San Francisco
Piano Club, and will herself give
several concerts preparatory to
leaving for Uerlin to continue her
studies.
