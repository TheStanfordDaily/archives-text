Much complaint has been heard
from would-be competitors for the
Junior Annual prize story that one
thousand words is entirely too short.
It does not give scope to the imagi
nation or literary ability, and re
duces what should be a prominent
feature of the book to a mere sketch.
If the editors, these persons say,
wish to encourage competitors to
send in well-developed plots and
smooth, evenly balanced prose, they
should extend the limit live hund
red or a thousand words.
