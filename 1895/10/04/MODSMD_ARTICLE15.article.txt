These are certain students who
by questions, unnecessary and not
pertinent to the topic under con
sideration, waste a great part of
every recitation hour. At times
questions are a great help to both
student, and instructor. The busi

hunting a regular course of study is
an injustice to the class as a whole,
and quite unnecessary in view of
the fact that the instructors are
willing to clear up difficulties at
the conclusion of the hour.
