As the practice becomes more
spirited and interesting a corres
pondingly larger number of specta
tors gather every evening on the
field to witness the play. Every
one is equally anxious to see :ili the
details of ii tine tackle or a good in
terference and forges ahead of his
neighbor who in turn edges out a
little. Before the game lias pro
gressed long the side lines have
been lost, to sight entirely in the
crowd. A punted ball, although it
may f;ill within the lines, is lost to
view.
The freedom of the play is inter
fered with and an injustice done
the players. The view of the game
i-> practically the same without the

lines as ten feet in advance. There
should l>e enough earnest desire in'
the improvement of our men to;
cause each one of lis to look upon j
any person who steps over the side
lines as an interloper, lie will notj
long make himself conspicious hv |
standing there alone. Although the j
management dislikes the idea of
fencing off the field, something of j
this sort must be done if the stu
dents have not enough self-control'
to respect the rights of the players.
