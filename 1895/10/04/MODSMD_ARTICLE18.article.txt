One of the easiest ways to help
along the work of building up a
university, and one of which few
students stop to think, is to patro
nize those who advertise in the col
lege papers. The advertisers in a
college publication furnish no small
part of its support, and they have
a right to expect something more
than the mere satisfaction of seeing
their names in print. If these ad
vertisers charged exorbitant prices
for their goods and services, there
would be some excuse for passing
them by; but such is far from be
ing the case. They are most reas
onable in their demands, and the
very fact that they advertise in stu
dent papers goes to show that they
desire this class of trade and have
made provision for it. We do not
ask students to trade only with
those who advertise in the Daily
Palo Alto ; but we do without hesi
tancy ask them to watch the adver
tising columns of all Stanford pub
lications, to patronize the linns
whose names are there, and to let, it
be known why they do so. By as
suring business men that their in
vestments will bring a return, stu
dents can do much to make sure of
a constantly increasing patronage
from them. This will not bring
about any very wonderful results
this year, perhaps, or next; but rest
assured that, if the practice con
tinues, it will one day show its ef
feet on the literary activity of Stan
ford University. Our advertisers
are leaders in their respective lines, |
and we urge you to trade with
them whenever it is a I all possible
to do so.
