The".is and 'U9 teams were out
at four o'clock yesterday to prac
tice signals. '98 seems to have a
decided advantage both in weight
atid experience; ">'•> has several good
men, though their line is exceed
ingly light. .Judging from the pres
ent prospects the .Berkeley freshmen
will have another walk-over this
year. It will take a great amount
of hard, eoncientious work to
develop sufficient team work to
overcome the disadvantages in
weight and training of the '99 team
as it is at present.
After preliminary practice the
regular teams linfcd-up at five
o'clock and practiced for an hour.
Hi nee there are several candidates
for some positions, it is (.'apt. Coch
ran's method to lay off certain
players after about thirty minutes'
work and replace them with men
trying for the same position.

I! Reynolds fullback. j
Frankenheimer played his old
jiame at half. He made splendid
runs both around the end and
tlirough the line. .Jack Reynolds
also distinguished himself by good
gains. Ii was difficult to choose
between the three fullbacks.
Frazier punted very well and was
t<> be found in every play. Harry
Reynolds also punted well and
made some telling runs. W'eldon
failed to punt as well as the others
bul his line-bucking was above the
average. Cotton played by far the
best end but is rather slow getting
down the licld. 'Phis is the great
fault of all our ends—they invari
ably allow the fullback to return
the punt. Cochran is playing
harder and better than he ever did
before. Ihe same may be said of
Harrington at guard and Rice at
tackle. With three such men as
(iarton, Lewers, a1 id Carle t<> cho<>se
from we should be able to ] lit a
Pirst-c!a-s snaphack on the field by
Tim nk-gi ving.

The on-lookers appeared to ap
preciate the poor l>ut amusing tackle
of Code by (iarton more than any 1
of the tine runs or brilliant tackles
of the game.
