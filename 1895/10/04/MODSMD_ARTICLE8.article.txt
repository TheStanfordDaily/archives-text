# Shall We See "As You Like It"?
## 
### 
Jt (loos not seem to be generally
understood among the students that
the proposed production of ''As You
Like It" will far surpass any
thing which lias ever been seen on
the campus, both in point of size
and niagnilicence. Yet this is the
case. The actual expense of pro
ducing this will be somewhere in
the neighborhood of six hundred
dollars, which is a mere trifle when
compared to the expense of the per
formance on Sutro Heights. Yet in
spite of this heavy out lay, the cause
of charity received about fifteen
hundred dollars.
Of course, it. is not expected that
there will be any three thousand
people present when given here, but
twelve hundred has been placed as
a low estimate. If six hundred
tickets can be disposed of to stu
dents there is little doubt but that
the remainder can be sold in San
Francisco, San .lose, and the sur
rounding towns. Many who were
disappointed in not being able to
gain admission at Sutro Heights
will certainly avail themselves of
the opportunity of seeing it, and
some who did gain admission will
desire to see it again. Others will
take this chance to visit the I'ni
versity and see the sights.
Although half of the people
would be drawn from the outside
yet it rests with the students and
faculty as to whether tlie manager
of "As You Like It" can be in
duced to give a performance here,
lie insists that some security be
given for at le;ist the actual ex
peiiM's. A guarantee of live or six
hundred dollars might be put up,
but die management of the Annual
does not feel able to do this, how

ever slight the risk might be. Sub
scription lists have been put into
the hands of twelve students and it
is earnestly hoped that every one
who can possibly afford it will be
willing to signify his intention of
securing a ticket when the perform
ance comes off. A list has also
been left at the Registrar's ofliee
which is especially intended for the
professors.
