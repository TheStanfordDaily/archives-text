The work now being done on the
syllabi in certain lecture courses
is abominable. The greatest fault
lies in the mimeographing, both in
the care taken and the grade of ink
used. Cheap printers' ink on
sized paper is not a success; it is
impossible to handle a sheet on
which it has been used without
blurring it.
The printed syjlabi which
Professor Thoburn's class in Ethics
!S is now receiving are much more
satisfactory than the mimeo
graphed sheets. It is to be hoped
that the use of this method of pre
paring them will spread.
