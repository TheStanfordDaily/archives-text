A feature which was all too
notable at the reception Saturday
night was the tendency to separate
into cliques. For some time it
seemed that no one considered it
his place to see that those un
acquainted were introduced. What
wonder was it that a bunch of
Freshmen should stand in one
corner with "excuse-me-for-living"
expressions on their countenances.
No doubt this was caused by
thoughtlessness on the part of those
who wanted to talk with old friends,
but this did not make it any
pleasanter for those who were
strangers and could not find any
one with enough time to spare to
introduce them to somebody.
