How few there are who realize
how great u debt they owe to their
dlmn mater! To enter college and
absorb all the knowledge possible,
put the professors to all the trouble
possible, and give as little in return
as possible, is as far as many are
disposed to go in serving the uni
versity whose degree they hope to
win and carry forthwith them into
the world. Yet it is manifestly
true that the college whose students
all acted on this principle would
not long attract outside attention,
but would soon become so obscure
and inglorious that the coveted,

all-important diploma would he of
but little value to its possessor. It
is an open question whether a
university does u<>t owe as much of
its reputation and influence to its
student body as to its corps of
instructors. Certain it is that an
enthusiastic body of students can
add much to the value of a degree
taken at any college, and the per
son who accepts a degree without
having done something to raise the
reputation of the institution grant
ing it is certainly one of the most
ungrateful persons existent.
We have a higher duty to our
alma mater than the mere main
tenance of a fair degree of scholar
ship in the recitation room. The
ideal college man will not stop
there. He will do everything in
his power to raise the reputation of
the school he attends. He will
help the institution to which he
looks for help. If he is an athlete,
he will not stand back and allow
points to be scored against his fel
low students in the field because a
weaker man is in the position he
might have filled more acceptably.
If he is a speaker or debater, he
will not take so much work that he
must stand idly by and see the
representatives of a rival school
win the laurels he might have kept
at home. If he wields a facile
pen or has a ''nose for news," he
will feel himself in duty bound to
take an active part in college
journalism and do what he can to
make the publications of his chosen
school second to none in the land.
If he can do so without being nar
row-minded or inconsistent, he will
always exert himself to the utmost
to have his alma mater looked upon
as the best the country affords. He
will let no opportunity pass to add
to her renown. Such a person will
be welcomed as a student in any
university and when he leaves the
dear old campus for the last time,
he will take pleasure in the thought
that he has helped himself without
being a parasite.
