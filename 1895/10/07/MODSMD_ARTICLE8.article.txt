# The 						Greater and Lesser Miracles.
## 
### 
The Sunday sermon yesterday i
was delivered l>v Dr. Elliott. The J
following is n brief abstract:
Owing to the ceaseless activity in j
art, science, and philosophy, the]
whole face of nature has been
changed; in almost every domain
of knowledge the wisdom of the
ages has been discredited, or sup-1
planted by a knowledge deeper and
truer. It was inevitable that this
spirit of investigation should in- 1
vade the domain of religions belief'
and theological affirmation, not
withstanding the feeling by some
that it was an advance upon the I
citadel of faith. Our present pre
vailing spirit of inquiry, and free
dom from traditionalism, has di
rected attention, with daring quest,
to I he written documents which
purport to reveal God to man, and
especially to that phenomena of
miracle which has stood so high in
the formal evidence of the Church.
Putting wholly aside the realm
of religion and psychology, no fact
has science made more evident than
that miracles do not happen, which
signifies that superstition has
passed away, knowledge increased.
The lightning and tempest, the
earthquake and the eclipse, have
taken their place among the law
obeying events of the universe.
Such miracles belonged tothechiid
hood of the race, during which, as
now, the unknown was always mys
terious; but the illusions of child
hood imperceptibly vanish in the j
sunshine of growing knowledge.
Turning to history, no one will j
deny that the Church has passed]
through this child-age; when noth-j
ing was more common than fora
holy man to be lifted up from the
floor in the midst of his devotions,
or be visited by the Virgin or an
angel; when there was scarcely a :
town but could show a relic of some
miracle. All such miracles were
established beyond the possibility
of a doubt, but whet) Europe]
emerged from the childhood of the
Middle Ages all this miraculous
phenomena passed awav, although
belief in the reality of the miracles
that had been, long remained.
It was inevitable that the miracle '
stories of the Bible should be ma
terially affected by this profound
change of attitude toward the mi
raculous. Indeed, in the light of'a
deepening experience of nature and
law, and a broader vision of the
(iod-method, we have one of two
alternatives: either shut our eyes
to science and knowledge, and re
fuse them entrance into the realm j
of religious belief, or else reject the |
miracle and along with it the Bible.;
All things are explained by cause
and effect, and there is no mystery
when knowledge is perfected; but
in the pride of this folly we may]
persuade ourselves that everything
is comprehended within ihe terms]
of t he materia I.
This hard alternative is probably |
due to the rigid definition which
Protestantism gave to the term
''miracle." In breaking from Pome
Put her and his followers wholly re-]
jceted the miracle stories of the
older Church, but, giving full
authority to the New Testament,
thev sharply emphasized the mir-j
acles which differentiated it from
the miracle stories of the Church.'

j Miracles were no longer the usual,
i ordinary accompaniment of Divine
! Power. "They were very rare ami
I exceptional phenomena, the pri-
I mary object of which was always to
j accredit the teacher of some divine
j truth that could not otherwise be
j established."'
Heretofore, miracles have been
; popularly spoken of an transcending
land controverting the laws of
| nature. This, however, is purely a
I mediaeval conception of the speeial
'method of God's providence. Mira
cle, in its original sense, means
wonder-work — something unusual
and extraordinary ; but the notion
that it is therefore a violation of
law grew up only when the natural
became differentiated from the
supernatural. It is the triumph
of the militant faith of our own
time to restore the belief in the im
minence of God — God in his
world, not separated from it.
That Christ's personality was un
usual and that his power over
nature and man exceed that of
those who crowded about him, no
one denies. What wonderful
works an exalted nature like Christ's
might do among spiritual laws and
forces we do not know ; and to say
we do not know is but to confess
jour ignorance of psychical laws,
i If one will but read the New Testa
ment with its evidential character
i of miracles in mind, he will be sur
j prised at the» little stress laid on
! them. How few and simple, and
how quietly performed, are these
j wonder-works ! As I'rof. Fisher re
| marks, "He performed these mira
| cles under seeming protest lest
| their unnatural glare should ob
j scure the deeper truths he was try
i ing to impart."
That belief in the New Testament
miracles must pass away,as\latthew
| Arnold so confidently assumed, is
Iby no means certain. This much
must be admitted by all: that we,
; living in a colder age and sterner
! climate, out of touch with Oriental
warmth and fire, have laid a wholly
; wrong emphasis upon the miracles
]of the Uible. Belief as a contortion,
jas an assault of the supernatural
upon the natural, inevitably fades
as that sharp antagonism between
the natural and supernatural itself
passes away. We are perhaps on
I the verge <>112 psychic discoveries
which shall show the mystery and
power of the unseen life as we have
I never known it before.
Vet when the shock of such pos
sibilities seems too great for the
anchor of our faith, and our frail
bark seems perforce about to be
| driven out into the troubled ocean
of doubt, we may dare affirm:
j Jesus of Nazareth was no juggler.
His power over nature, and above
nature, if such they were, were not
powers of darkness. Me was un
usual and transcendent in bis sim
j plicity and spiritual integrity, in
j the directness of his intuitions, in
his sympathy, in his Humanity.
