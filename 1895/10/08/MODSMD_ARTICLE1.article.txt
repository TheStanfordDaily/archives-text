A smaller number than usual
witnessed the practice last evening.
What the crowd lacked in number
it made up in enthusiasm,however.
All of the star plays received the
proper amount of applause. Another
noticeable fact was that there was
no crowding over the side lines.
The game itself was exceedingly
interesting. It abounded in long
runs by both sides, good clean
tackles, and at some points no
mean amount of interference was
shown. The punting also on a
whole was far above the average
that has been displayed this sea
son.
The prettiest play of the day was
made when Overacker took the ball
and with the splendid interference
of Leavitt, Mcintosh, and Weldon
carried it twenty-live yards into
the opponents' territory where he
was downed by Harry Reynolds,
who tackled him in line form.
.Jack Reynolds, Frankenheimer,
Spalding, and Leavitt each made
good runs. Hut, with the except
ion of the instance noted above,
1 he runs were made almost entirely
without interference of any kind.
1Â». Thomas did some very fair
tackling, as did James at guard.
I'he latter played a very aggressive
game and broke through the line
repeatedly, finding it easy to over
come bis weighty opponent, Brown.
Campbell did just about as he
pleased with <)skison.
There was very little fumbling
last night, both quarters passing
the ball well. Our fullbacks are
still apt to hesitate too long before
returning a punt. Often, when
there is ample time in which to
kick, the fullback attempts a run,
and is downed without making
much gain.
