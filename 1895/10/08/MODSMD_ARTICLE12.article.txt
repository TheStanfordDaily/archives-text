The showing made 1 Â»v the fresh
man team in their recent game
with the sophomores was far from
encouraging for the future. Aside
from the individual playing of two
or three men, the freshmen played
a decidedly weak game. If they are
intending to play the Berkeley fresh
men it is about time more interest
should he displayed and a greater
class pride developed. The man
agement of the team has been ener
getic and has arranged for one
game at least, to take place Oct.
26. If the proper spirit were
aroused the light weight of the

team could lie counterbalanced by j
conscientious practice on the part'
|of the men. Every freshman who
I has weight and build for the line
I should he persuaded to get out with,
the team, lie is in that way ad-1
i vancing not only his class interests J
but is aiding his college as well. |
