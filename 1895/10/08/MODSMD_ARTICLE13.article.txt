It is a cause of much speculation
to those who have seriously dis
cussed the matter, why Stanford
does not draw more heavily for its
annual levy of new students upon
the various high schools and pre
paratory schools located in its
immediate vicinity. It used to he
stated, and with reason too, that
the schools of San Mateo and Bel
mont were but preparatory schools
for this University; but with the
beginning of this college year it can
no longer be denied that the tide
has turned. We used to register
the greater part of the graduates of
these institutions, but this year the
registration from them is very slight.
Why this should be so is not very
apparent, especially when we con
sider the fact that we are so inti
mately asssociated with them.
Their men and teams engage in
numerous athletic contests with
Stanford each year, and in more
ways than one they are brought
into intimate connection with this
institution. Hut something seems
to be wrong. Perhaps it is our
fault; perhaps it is their's; but at
any rate we should devote all our
energies in the future to bringing
the students of such schools into
closer touch with our University,
and strive to make our in
terests their interests. For it is a
matter of greater importance than
most people imagine for us to have
these preparatory schools upon
which we can depend for our
usual quota of good men each year;
and which moreover serve as a
training school in all the various
lines of athletics. It is worth our
while to count the friendship of
those schools that can send us well
prepared students who at the same
time are trained in athletics.
