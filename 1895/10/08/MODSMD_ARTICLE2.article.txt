It wa> generally conceded, even
before the teams appeared, that 'US

I would win, on account of the ad
vantage in weight and experience.
'99's team was exceedingly light
and the center men were ignorant
of the very rudiments of the game.
This lack of knowledge caused '99
I to loose fifteen yards during the
l game, by off-side plays. During
the lirst half, '98 made but one
j touch-down in the first half, and
the ball was in the hands of "99
nearly as much as in those of '98.
In the second half,' 99 did not have
the ball a single time except at
kick-off.
At the start, '98 took the ball
and '99 the east goal. Plate kicked
off poorly, and Frazier missed the
catch. '98 downed the ball, how
ever, and bv short gains worked
the ball down towards '99's goal.
Leavitt took the ball and by a
splendid run carried it about thirty
yards, and was cleverly tackled by
Plate. '98 failed to make live yards
and lost the ball on '99's ten-yard
line. '99 punted and '98 returned
the punt. The pigskin was kicked
I back and forth several times. Over
! acher fumbled, the Sophomores got
the ball and drove it slowly into
| '99's territory. Cotton carried it
over the line, making the lirst
touch-down. Frazier missed goal.
Time of play, l."> minutes; score,
! 4-0.
Plate kicked off. Leavitt caught
I the ball and made a good run but
| was downed by P. Smith. After
several scrimmages, in which little
I gain was made, .Frazier punted and
Plate returned the punt. Time
I called with ball near center of held.
lu second half '99 led off with a
kiek-off, '98 got the ball and pro
ceeded to tear '99's center to pieces.
I Cotton took the ball and gained
