Theiih seems to be a misconcep
tion among the members of the
Hand in regard to the use of the
gymnasium for practice. It is said
that the Hand will not be reorgan
ized this year because the gymnas
ium cannot be obtained. This we
are informed is a mistake as the
gymnasium will be placed at their
disposal on the same terms as here
tofore.
It is hoped that nothing will
prevent our having as good a Band
as we had last year at least; there
ought to be enough musical talent
in the class of '99 to make it a
great deal better. But by all means
we must have a Band; our Thanks
giving celebration will be incom
plete without it.
