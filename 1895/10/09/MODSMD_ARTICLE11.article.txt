The student body meets 011 Fri
day evening to consider the propo
sition of having the editor-in-chief
of the Sequoia elected directly by
the student body. It will be inter
esting to note what action will be
taken on this matter. Both the
proposed change and the present
system have their disadvantages.
When 1 lie student body controls
the matter directly, there is danger
that m merely popular man may
beat out a man who is tilted for the
position. On theother hand, under
the present regime small cliques of
politicians may gain direct hold of
the members of the committee. It
is to be hoped that our able men
will express their opinion freely at
the meeting, in order that the better
of the two methods may be chosen.
