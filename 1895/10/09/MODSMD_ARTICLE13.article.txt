The football situation will be
peculiar this year. Yale and Har
vard, the originators of the Ameri
can game, and famous old rivals,
will not play each other this year.
Pennsylvaniaâ„¢?, who virtually took
last year's champonship, are oc
cupying a decidedly prominent posi
tion. Harvard will meet the Uni
versity of Michigan, thus carrying
the game farther west than the
"big four" lias done for some years.
Add to this the fact that both Har
vard and Yale contemplate a trip
to the Pacific Coast, and the sea
son's outlook becomes decidedly
peculiar.
These changes are mostly for the
best. They prevent cast-iron con
servatism. and tend to extend the
scope of the game. The admirers
of ''Fair Harvard" and of all-vic
torious Yale will be sorry to miss
the Springfield game, but old
friends like Harvard and Yale
cannot long remain at variance.
