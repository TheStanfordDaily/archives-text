# No Harvard-Yale Game.
## 
### 
Harvard and Yale will not meet
on the gridiron this year. That
much was officially settled by the
lfarvary Athletic Committee Mon
day. Harvard had given Yale
warning that a challenge must lie
received by Oct. o or it would not
be considered, and the failure of
that challenge to arrive is the cause
of the above action. It is under
stood that while Yale is apparently
willing to play Harvard, yet she
has secretly demanded an apology
from Harvard for last year's mis
understanding before she will enter
into a contract fora game. This
action will probably break football
relations of the two colleges for at
least a couple of years. Harvard
has now only one important game
on her hands, that with the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania on Nov. 23,
but since the failure to arrange a
game with Yale, she has been putting
forth all her efforts fora restoration
of friendly relations with Princeton,
which were broken off six years ago,
and it is very probable that a con
test Avill be arranged with that col
lege for Nov. 9.
