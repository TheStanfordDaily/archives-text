Prof. Lathrop spoke last evening
on "Elizabethan Lyrics." The
reading was interspersed with sing
ing of typical ballads by Mrs.
Lathrop, accompanied on the piano
by Mrs. Ashley of Oakland. This
feature, new to the Tuesday even
ing lectures, was greatly apprec
iated. each number being roundly
applauded. Prof. Lathrop spoke as
follows:
I t isj, a saying of Carlyle's that
all deep ! hings are sung. Observe, he 1
says, how all genuine passion does
express itself rhythmically; even!
jealous anger finds its expression!
in a sort of chant or tune. The!
more complete the sway of the pas-1
sion the more complete is the ex-1
pression a rhythmical one. Primi- i
live man finds his feelings morel
expressed by it than civilized man, j
but all of us tend to express I
ourselves rhythmically. In the
primitive time one linds every ex-1
pression that arises above the com-j
njonpla.ee dignified by rhythmic j
movements. This is at the bottom j
of all poetry. Savages sway their;
bodies to and fro in a rhythmic)
movement to express themselves;!
they have the ghost-dance, war-!
dance, and funeral-dance, and the j
song is only inarticnlate howling.!
All this union of rhythm and the j
body and the voice in order to ex
press passion, does not come to!
poetry; put words to it and you
have the beginning of all true'
poetry. If the words express action '
and are connected with action we j
express the drama; if they express 1
emotion simply we have a lyric. -
Of course this rhythm of move-!
ment with the expression of words j
is not all confined to savage or i
primitive life. In the Greek drama
there is a union between rhythmic
movement and high poetry.
Nowadays, I think that this'
natural union between verse and
the rhythm of music-is very often'
forgotten. The earliest poetry was!
sung and acted. Later came the j
poetry that was merely sung. This!
close relation between the voice and I
verse was clearly in the mind of the!
song writers of the Elizabethan
age.
Song demands music for its com
plete expression; it does not speak
its full meaning until it is sung. Jf i
you read through the song books of
the Elizabethan age, you will ft ml!
above the songs these words: " to j
any pleasant tune"; the melody of j
the verse as it stands by itself is in-J
complete.
The oldest kind of verse which I
enters into the Elizabethan song is|
the folk-song of England. In this!
we often find that union of the I
dance rhythm with the rhythm of'
music combined with the move
ment of the song for its own sake. !
Ballad, as you know, meant a '
dance-song. \Ve find this music i
models of rhythm. The harpers go-1
ing about from place to place, play-'
ing at the iireside of the peasant or j
in the hall of the lord, sang to their
own accompaniments. Their primi- :
live harps would be struck at every i
one of the accented syllables. One
of the most famous of these old ba 1-
lads is the ballad of "Chewy Chase." j
It relates the combats between the j
English and the Scotch. [Sung by |
Mrs. Lathrop.] 1

Another source of the songs was
I the religious music. An illustra
! lion of this is the song called " The
i hoar's head," still sung hv Oxford
students; it is a fine old carol.
[Sung hy M rs, Lathrop.]
The third group of Elizabethan
| song was the Italian cultivated
I song of the period. Thinking of
| Henry Ylll as the murderer and
marrier of many wives, we may lind
j it strange t<> think of him as a
writer of words and music for songs
; and dances ; hut so he was. ilis
court was the gayest that lias ever
been and Henry was the gayest in
it. He wrote a great many songs,
generally of the type of Italian
I music; we have one interesting
J song of his, "Pastime with good
j company." [Sung by Mrs. Lath
i rop.]
It. would take too long to
dwell upon the development of the
; forms of Elizabethan verse from
i these three sources, ballads, carols,
| and country songs. Throughout
I the reigns of Henry VIII, Mary, and
Elizabeth it was a fashionable ac
complishment to write verse and
music. The gentlemen wrote down
; their songs and made manuscript
| volumes of their song-books. The
| general sources of music of this
j time therefore are the song-books.
You will lind in most of them the
heading, "To any pleasant tune."
Most of the common tunes are
known to us now. One of the most
common is to the song, "Fain would
1 have a pretty thing to give unto
my lady." [Sung by Mrs. Lath
jrop.]
it is interesting to see that most
i music and words become more in
teresting in the course of develop-
I nlent.
When we come to Shakspere we
find his songs no better than the
| lirst, sometimes not so good; but
they are distinguished by dramatic
power and fitness. This is true
whether he wrote them himself or
| borrowed them. "The winter's
! tale" of "Hamlet"' was borrowed in
j this way.
Among the selections read were
poems bv Sidney, (jretfn, Breton,
Peele, Nash, Marlowe, Lodge, Dek
ker, Fletcher, and Shakspere. Songs
by the same authors were sung, in
cluding Sidney's "Ring out, good
! bells"; "Green Sleeves," by Breton;
I "What a plague is love," and
| "Early one morning," Peele; "The
pretty I>essie," "It was a lover and
! his lass," and "Jog on, jog on,"
j Lodge; "Mistress mine, where are
j you roving?" Fletcher; and Des-
I demona's song, "Willow, willow,
i willow."
