The disagreeable feeling of
enmity shown by some of the
players in the class game yester
day warrants more than passing
criticism. If interclass games are
going to lead to nothing but squab
bling among players and protest
ing decisions of the umpire, the
contests should be stopped at once.
Class spirit is to be commended,
but when it degenerates into class
passion, displayed at a dozen stages
of the game, it is time to call a halt
and drop the class contests from
the schedule of college events.
