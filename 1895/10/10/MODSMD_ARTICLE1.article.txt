# Freshman vs. Varsity.
## 
### 
The Freshmen lined up against
the first team yesterday in order to
get in trim for their contest with
the Centerville team on Saturday.
To judge from the showing made
last night, the '99 men need a great
deal of such practice. Most of all,
though, they need heavy men for
the line. The hacks and ends are
sufficiently strong, hut the center is
exceedingly weak. With the ex
ception of Garton there are no
heavy candidates for the Freshman
eleven.
In the iirst few moments of play
the first eleven had an exceedingly
easy time with their less skillful ad
versaries. Nearly every run at
tempted by the Varsity was good
for at least five yards, and the ball
was soon carried over the line fora
touchdown. After the second
kick-off the men of the first team
seemed to lose all interest in the
play and the youngsters, encouraged
by the spectators who showed a
great deal of sympathy for them,
gained heart. Their luck was with
them from this on. Weldon at
tempted to kick, the ball was
blocked, and Bride fell on it near
the twenty-ffYe yard line. By
several plays through the center
the pig-skin was forced to the Var
sity ten-yard line. Overacker was
then given the ball and by a line
run around right end made a touch
down.
Of the ends, Cotton and Smith
played by far the best game. Bride,
at tackle, was far too light to stand
much show against his weighty op
ponents, but he followed the ball
very well.
Both snapbacks appeared to
think that it was far easier to stand
around arid watch the other men
than to do a little conscientious
work on their own account. Gar
ton, especially, shirked far too
much.
Weldon's punting was not up to
his usual standard. J. Reynolds
made some good runs, hut gave up
a little too easily. Overacker made
the best runs for his side. B.
Thomas, R. F. Smith, and Mcin
tosh did the best tackling.
