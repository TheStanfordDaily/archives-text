It grows tiresome to continually
harp on the suhjectof low speaking
in classes, particularly in language
recitations. The speaker who
whispers in a sepulchral voice is
mistaken if she considers herself
peculiarly femine; she is regarded
as ill-lÂ»red and unaccommodating,
ior the rest of the class lose the
value of the translation, and often
fail on whole paragraphs the next
day because they have been unable
<o hear them read.
There is nothing more attractive
than a clear, beautiful voice, ac
companied by distinct enunciation.
