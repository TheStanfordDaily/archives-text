Tiik college spirit runs high at
present, which is encouraging for
so early in the year. In previous
years the Daily Palo Alto was
tilled with exhortations to stu
dents to lire the enthusiasm of the
team by their constant attendance
and applause. These first weeks
have shown a surprising at ten da nee,
mikl an interest that never Hags.
The new students have brought in
with them loyalty and enthusiasm,
to a large extent. There may be
material in the Freshman class for
those long-expected college songs.
Stranger things have happened,
The Pioneers were freshmen once.

While assessments are being
collected for everything else, some
patriotic student should start a
fund fora flag to be kept flying at
all times from the quadrangle fhig
staff. Students are prone to for
got in the midst of their studies
that to which they owe their oppor
tunity to study and the benefits
that surround them in their daily
life. .Most collegians are brought
up from childhood with as devout
a reverence for their flag and all it
symbolizes and as firm an alleg
iance to it as any class < 112 persons
in the Union. It is strange that
over so great an institution as this
"Old Glory" waves on state oc
casions only, and that the student,
instead of enjoying a sight of his
country's banner every day of his
college life, sees it but once or twice
a year.
