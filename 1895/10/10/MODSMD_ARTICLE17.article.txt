the large social events be dis
tributed throughout the year, in
stead of piling up as heretofore in
commencement season. In the last
days there are countless loose
threads to catch up, theses to be

aminations, then the many "fare
wells forever" to be gone through

at the end of the college year, not
to speak of his spirits, and some
pleasures must be sacrificed on this
account; or if he manages to borrow
enough to take in everything, he is
tired and satiated. During the
long winter months an occasional
small entertainment, even though
simple, would brighten up Stanford
existence immeasurably.
