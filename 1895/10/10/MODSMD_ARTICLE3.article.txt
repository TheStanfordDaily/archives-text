# "Adonis" Dixey.
## 
### 
The coming of Henry E. Dixey
is a rare treat for Stanford. After
lectures on philosophy his perform
ances will he like wine after meat.
Of all impersonators in the world
Dixey ranks first. Those who see
him as "adorable Adonis" with
fair hair and hlue eyes stare in
amazement at the melancholy,
swarthy Henry Irving or the ec
centric Paderewski. The oppor
tunity of seeing this fascinating
man of many moods a few feet from
us in our own chapel is one that
should not he missed, while the
cheapness of admission enables
every one to enjoy the pleasure.
Dixey began his career as the
hind leg of a stage mtile, and gradu
ally rose through minor positions
!to his present enviable place.
'â€¢Adonis'' won his fame. The play
is a burlesque on " Pygmalion and
Galatea," and the hero appears as
| a perfect statue. Instead of coin
ling to life with fluttering eyelids
and wavering breath, lie astounds
| the audience by dancing a jig upon
j the pedestal.
| Dixey's wit is sparkling, but his
character impersonations shows his
true merit.
Last year he starred in"The
Seven Ages of Man," a play
adapted from Shakspere's lines in
j "As You Like ft In this he repre
sented successively the infant, the
schoolboy, the squire, and soon,
|to the old man, sans teeth, sans
ears, satis everything. This sounds
j impracticable fora drama, but the
play was a success, and gave the
artist scope for his original and
unique line of work. His lightning
changes of costume may furnish
; pointers for our gymnasium aspir
j ants.
This year, Dixey's repertoire
I comprises several new pieces. His
i work in the chapel will necessarilv
be limited by the lack of stage
; equipments. Vet, on the other
! hand, we shall have the oppor
tunity of feeling the personality of
j the man as well as the actor.
The sale of seats began thisafter
! noon, but, as very few knew when
tickets would be put on sale, there
j are still some good seats unsold,
i Fifty cents is almost a nominal
I price ; one that could only be ob
tained at a university-
