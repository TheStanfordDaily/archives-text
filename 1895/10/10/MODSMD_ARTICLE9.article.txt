Concerning the fact that few ad
dresses by outside men nre heard
at Berkeley, the Occident says:
Stanford lias long set us an ex
cellent example in this respect, but
one which we obstinately refused
to follow. No comparison more un
favorable to us could well be made
than by placing Stanford's achieve
ments in this respect alongside of
ours. In tlie short time that Uni
versity has been open this term
scarcely a week has passed without,
an address by some noted lecturer.
Meanwhile we have been peacefully
dozing here, shaking our heads in
solemn admiration of divers and
sundry wicked youths who have
been engaged in the unholy practice
of unhooking the library. If we
have not invited lecturers to come
to Berkeley, it is, as our good friend
Sairey Gomp would put it, because
we have not felt so "dispoged."
