The lecture delivered before the
law classes last evening by Ilev.R. B.
Peet was well attended by law stu
dents, while many who are not in
the law classes took advantage of
the opportunity of hearing the well
known lecturer. The substance of
his remarks was as follows:
Fifty years ago Cole's "Voyage
of Life" described, not a high order
of art, but a popular one. It was an
idea to which every heart of en
thusiastic youth gives a response.
To every one who is to accomplish
anything in life, arises in his imagi
nation visions more or less vague
of that future which lies before
him, of that land on whose border
he stands —now the land of dreams,
but which he hopes to make reality.
And when occasionally toothers he
opens these thoughts that are swell
ing in his breast, he is too often
told by the practical father, that he
should content himself with tread
ing the old paths. By the mother
he is warned against the dangers of
ambition. Ambition ! There is the
power of life. Blot out those vis
ions that rise before the imagina
tion and man will not rise above
the level of the past. When man
does not rise he begins to fall. Fling
away the ambition which ruled
WooJsey to make himself great, but
not that ambition he held before
Cromwell as the statesman to live
for his country.
Two paths open before every
young man; few youths picture any
distinction between them. One is
that of attainment, tlx; other that
of accomplishment. The one makes
what you can get in life, the other
what you can do. At times these
paths coincide, but their separa
tion increases as we depart from
their common beginning. Ambi
tion is a power in our lives to ac
complish the visions of our youth.
That ideal marks out the path we
ought to follow, though we may not
and probably will not attain it in
its fullness, for our ideal should
ever be above us. Yet the highest
mark you can achieve is the only
one with which vou should be satis
tied.
To take a true view of life and
see the possibilities of the future we
need to lift ourselves above the
future. Our ideals ought to grow
higher as we grow older, but gen
erally it is not so. Mingling with
the world dispels the glamour which
(to the youth) hangs over life. It
is not the soldier engaged in a
deadly battle who can most truly
judge the fortune of the conflict.
From what he knows he forms his
idea .of the rest. So in life, when
self-interest does not decide every
question, can we form our highest
ideals. So by going aside to a vant
age ground undisturbed by contact
with the world we can often study
more carefully the course of man
kind.
It was with this intent that Sen
ator Stanford founded this Univer
sity in the country and away from
the current of city life. Here, in
deed, ought to plan wisely.
The contests and rivalry going on
in the world are helpful in turning
your thoughts to something else
than the hard struggle in the out
side world. These struggles will be
forced upon you soon enough.

Every age has its ruling spirit
which sweeps all before it. The rul
ing spirit of this ;ige is socialistic
and utilitarian in tendency. It is
difficult for us to conceive of a time
when this spirit did not rule. Yet
that age called the chivalric age
directly contrasted with this utili
tarian spirit. Chivalry was a mili
tary spirit, or rather a form which
the military spirit ma ni tested. Then
it was that the bravery of a man
won the battle. It was a time of
personal, physical encounter. Truth
to your word, loyalty to your
leader, fealty to your comrade were
essentials of the age. But this age
passed away leaving the virtues
which it manifested as valuable for
true development today as ever.
Cervantes, in Don Quixote, did
that which battle could not do—
killed the knight.
What I have thus far said might
be said to all students; but now 1
have something to say to the law
students.
You are law students, but so in
a sense are all students within these
walls. Law is the power we see every
where about us, or, more accurately,
the way in which God, the center
of all power, acts. It applies to all
the material universe.
All on this earth are in more or
less dependance on each other —
bound together socially. On our
relationship depends our existence.
Law is the endeavor to attain these
relationships. Perfection of law
is reached in absolute justice;
but is there anything above
justice ?
Law is the expression of the will
of God as we see it in the world
about us. The word law may be
used in this three-fold application:
First, as an expression of the
will of God in reference to the
world of nature of which we form
a part.
Second, as our expression of the
will of God in reference to us —
that is, of what God would have us
do in our relation with one another
to the attainment of justice.
Third, our expression of the will
of God in reference to our relation
to Him and to each other, so as to
(ill out the perfection of our char
acter.
Each of these has its line of ad
vance and its ideal. The object of
the scientist's search in the natural
world is the revelation of truths.
To be true to his calling he must
observe two rules —first, he must
seek for truth alone, follow it where
e'er it lead; second, he is not to teach
as ascertained fact, that which he
only thinks. The line of advance
for the lawyer is as to the proper re
lation of man to man and man to
society.
The ideal of the scientist is truth;
of the lawyer, justice. But the
ideal of this third, on the line of
character, rises beyond our concep
tion. We cannot conceive the full
ness of that which the Son of Man
held before his disciples as the ideal
when he said, "Be ye perfect even
as your Father in Heaven is per
fect."
