The most trivial incidents have
often influenced the success of cer
tain men who have made enviable
reputations, and who, had they re
mained in the old groove, would
probably never have been heard
from. Cases of this kind, however,
are rare. History on the other
hand is full of men who by diligent
and systematic work have achieved
the same success. A foundation
well laid in college and a definitely
followed plan for the future were
chief factors in their success.
It is certainly more logical to
have before us on entering college a
distinct ideal toward which we
are constantly striving and to
which we must confine our course
of study, than to choose our
major on the grab-box plan
and wait for accidental trivialities
to influence for better or for worse
our future life work. To be sure
all knowledge is useful, but that
which applies more directly to our
future calling is certainly to be pre
ferred. A student may make no
mistake in changing from Engi
neering to Law, but, if he does not,
he had surely made a mistake in
the first selection of his major.
More thought should characterize
I the selection of the material out of
which we are to construct the
foundation of our career. A vacil
; lating and uncertain course of
study cannot lead to scholarship
fior can it lit one to do the best
1 work of which he is capable in after
i life.
