# To the Lady on the "Sequoia" Cover.
## 
### 
Oh lady with the wondrous dress,
1 would not disconcert thee,
Hut tell the honest truth -confess
Those awful wrinkles hurt thee.
Oh lady, very loath am I
To urge a quest unduly,
Vet fain I'd know the reason why
Thy anus s<> far outgrew thee.
Dost thou not know that pen aslant,
Whereon the ink doth linger,
Perchance (for pens are ungallant),
May smirch thy long white linger?
< >h lady, why that spread out sheet
Without a word upon it ?
Dost seek in vain for something
meet
Whereon to write a sonnet ?
.lust drop thy eyes, behold the row
Of wooden Hovvers enthralling ;
.lust gaze on these a while, and 1« >!
The muse will heed thy calling.
The ahove was written by a cynic
who does not know true art when he
sees it. —En.
