# Yesterday's Practice.
## 
### 
The Freshmen lined up against
the Sophomores fora few moments
! last night before the regular Varsity
practice. Their work amounted t<>
! hardly more than signal practice.
The lirst and second teams then
gave one of the loosest and poorest
exhibitions of football seen on the
new Held. The playing abounded
with high tackling and loose team
work. Of course there were several
j line plays made. Notable excep
| tions to the general order of pooi
! playing were the line runs by
I Frankenheimer and Jack Reynolds
behind the splendid interference of
I Code, and the tackling of Leavitt,
| Weldon, Poindexter, and James.
| The latter broke through the line
; in fine style several times. Weldon
i also made an excellent run of fif
-1 teen yards, with very little inter
! ference.
It is high time that each player
| should learn that every man is sup
! posed to be in every play. Five or
j six men out of eleven cannot play
; a winning game of football. When
i the ball is put in play it is the
j duty of the players to follow the
; air-bag, no matter how far it may
be carried. One man may not be
j able to force the ball very far, but
his weight, added to that of ten
other men, will count a great deal
in pushing the ball along.
As to high tackling there is some
i excuse fora green man, if he makes
a " neck-tie " tackle. But when a
j man has had one or two years' ex
! perience he is supposed to know
i that anything but a low tackle is
| inefficient.
The fullbacks do not seem to
know that when the captain says,
" Iteturn the ball," he means that
the ball should be kicked. Of
course a long run is more showy
than a punt, but there is far more
likelihood of gaining by a kick than
a run. Besides the captain is on
the field to be obeyed.
The spectators showed a great
deal of interest yesterday, and were
ever ready to applaud a good run
or clever tackle.
Harry Walton arrived on the
field during the practice, lie will
begin coaching today. McMillan
will probably not arrive this week,
j but will come down later. Such
loyalty, as is shown by these men,
I should inspire the candidates to
good hard work.
