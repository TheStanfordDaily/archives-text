# UNITED STATES vs. THE STANFORD ESTATE.
## SCORE 2-0 IN FAVOR OF THE LATTER. " Decision Solid for Us. Haul Up the Old Flag." 
### 
.lust before noon Saturday
:i dispatch was received at Palo
Alto announcing in the briefest
terms that Mrs. Stanford's demurrer |
had been sustained. The news was
hurried to the campus, arriving at;
lCncina while the usual ante-lunch
crowd was gathered in the lobby.
The tidings spread at once to the
row, the "camp," the quadrangle,
and Roble.
By common impulse a crowd
gathered, numbering at least six or
seven hundred, and turned toward
Xazminto congratulate l)r. Jordan.
Here it was learned that the Presi
dent was in the city, but would re-1
turn on the evening train. Nothing
daunted, they returned to the front
steps of Roble, where a general
demonstration was held. Speeches;
were made by representatives of
t lie classes. The speeches were short J
and to the point, and were wildly
applauded. Sophomores, who had
yelled until they lost their voices
at the morning's game, found them
again for the occasion, and every
dust-pan in Itoble was beaten into
scrap-iron.
it was decided to meet Dr.
Jordan at the 0:45 train. The
crowd then gradually melted away.
At the appointed hour almost
every Stanford student was lined
up at the Palo Alto depot. Two
t wo-hundred-and-fifty-foot ropes
had been attached to a gaily decor-j
a ted ca rriage. Pandemonium broke I
loose on the arrival of the train,
and then,down rows of smiling
maidens," like a conquerer of old,
Dr. Jordan passed to the triumphal
car. The procession took up its
march, the men at the ropes,
the women illuminating the scene
with hundreds of Japanese lan
terns. At intervals the crowd
broke into the Stanford yell.
A halt was made in front of
Itoble, and Dr. Jordan made aj
short speech. Then the march j
to Xazfnin was resumed, and Dr. |
and Mrs. Jordan finally alighted at |
their own door.
An invitation to "come in and:
see us" was accepted, and for over
an hour the President and Mrs. j
Jordan shook hands with a long 1
tile of exultant students.
An appeal to the Supreme Court
of the United States will probably j
betaken. If so, the case will be;
heard during the present session,
which began today. Joseph Choate
of New York has been retained by j
Mrs. Stanford to assist Russell
Wilson and Judge (Jarber before j
that tribunal.
The main points of the decision
read by Judge (iilbert and con
curred in by Judge Morrow and
Judge Hawley are here outlined:
The claim against the original
directors of theCentral Pacific Kail
road Company arose out of the con
tract existing between the United
States and the directors. The con-

tract is of a peculiar nature, and
the stockholders of its corporations,
was made at a time when Congress
was disposed to lie very liberal in
order to secure the construction of
the railroad.
Congress, in 1862 and by the
amendment of 18(14. made the grants
of land and loaned the bonds to the
Pacific Railroads. The Pacific Rail
roads were the Central Pacific and
Western Pacific of California, and
! the Union Pacific. The Central
Pacific and Western Pacific were
corporations existing under t he law
of California. The Union Pacific
was created by the act of 1862.
Nothing is said in this act as to the
individual liability of the stock
holders. The individual liability
of the members of a corporation is
a creature of statute, and therefore
the directors of the I'nion Pacific
| are not individually liable for the
debt of the corporation.
The Centra l Pacific, which is a
consolidation of the Central Pacific
| and the Western Pacific of Califor
; nia, received the same benefits and
were granted the same immunities
i and privileges by the act of 1862
and the amendment of 18lj4 as the
Union Pacific. \\ by then should
the directors of the I nion Pacific be
exempt from liability and the di
rectors of the Central Pacific not?
The answer of the (lovernment is
that the Central Paific was created
by an act of the Caifornia Legisla
ture and that the laws of Califor
nia impose individual liability on
By the act of 1862theCentral Paci
fic and the Western Pacific were con
solidated in the Central Pacific by
act of Congress, and it, has been
held by the Supreme Court that
''where corporations are con
solidated under and by virtue ofan
act of Congress thev are to be
treated as corporations formed and
organized under the act of Con
gress." It was held in the
case of the Kansas Pacific, which
was consolidated with the Union
Pacific, that "it must be regarded
las a corporation organized under
and by virtue of the laws of the
j United States." These cases show
' clearly that though a corporation
|is formed under a state law it be
comes a creature of the law of the
i United States when adopted by
; Congress.
Fina 11y, as showing that Congress
j intended that the Union Pacific
land Central Pacific should stand
<ui the same footing as regards in
dividual liability of stockholders,
I it was provided that the two cor
porations might consolidate.
Such consolidation would natur
ally make the stockholders of the
corporations subject to the same
liabilities. If the Union Pacific
were amalgamated with the Central
Pacific, it is obvious that the di-
I rectors would not thereby be made
individually liable; and further, if
the Central Pacific were amalgam
ated with the I'nion Pacific the di
rectors of the Central Pacific should
enjoy the same freedom from lia
bility. This would be the only re
sult, for there cannot be a corpora
tion with part of the stockholders
individually liable and part not.
