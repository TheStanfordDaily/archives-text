enthusiastic.

touch. '98's ball.

by bucking and henceforth drive
their men with great force against i
the weak points in the Seniors''

line. In two downs .Jeff gains live
yards through the line. The
crowds cheer him and urge the
men to harder work. ".Mi realizes
that 98 is playing football, and
the men henceforth go to work with
determination. The Seniors are on
the defensive now.
In three downs Frazier and Jeff
have gained live yards, principally
through "Hi's right takle. Jeff
makes five more. This new player
is putting uj> a game that would
make a Varsity man green with
envy.

Frazier punts well. Code makes a
fair catch. '98's sympathizers
shout in a manner seldom heard
outside of a big game. Code tries
a free kick and Cotton downs the
ball on '96's fifteen-yard line.
Field takes Campbell's place and
Campbell relieves McGuire. The
ball is forced to the Seniors' live
yard line and rests there at call of
time for the first half.
During the intermission Captain
Cotton objects to Field's substitu
tion for McGuire. He claims that
the latter is not hurt but is taken
out <>n account of his ignorance of
the position. The umpire allows
Field to play.
Before the call of time Cotton
declares that the game shall be
played under protest.
