" It is our judgment that the de
murrer to the bill was properly
sustained for want of equity, and
the decree of the Circuit Court is
accordingly affirmed." Those
closing words of the thirty-five
typewritten pages must have been
sweetest music to Dr. Jordan and
the staunch friends of the Univer
sity who had gathered in that
dingy court-room Saturday to hear
the decision of the Circuit Court of
Appeals read. Their smiles and
hand-shakes and congratulations
hut poorly expressed the joy they
felt. The good news spread out
over the city and flashed over the
wires to Palo Alto and the Univer
sity. Our joy did not need to be
restrained. And yet the Stanford
yell, the blare of tin-horns, the
ringing of bells, the shriek of
whistles, did not express it. It
was inexpressible.
The anxiety of the past week
had been intensely painful and had
increased with every day. Even
those most confident at first of a
decision in our favor became
alarmed at the unexpected delay.
We argued with ourselves and with
each other that the delay could
have no meaning adverse to our
causeâ€”that we had no reason to
fear the result; but our convincing
arguments did not convince, and
every one feared more and more as
day after day passed and brought
no decision.
The reaction that came with the
sudden news of victory explains
whatever there may have been of
the irrational in our conduct.
However excessive and exuberant
our joy it was justified bv the im
portance of its cause. Another
strong, careful, scholarly decision
has been added to the bulwarks of
the University. Four able judges,
learned and respected by the bar,
have decided that the (Jovernment
has no claim on the estate upon
which the existence of the ('Diver
sity depends. We can now rest
assured that the future of Stanford
is in no danger. The appeal to
the Supreme Court is little more
than a matter of formality. At
torney-General Harmon is con
fessedly uninformed in the case,
otherwise it would probably never
be taken. Hut of course the dis
comfited attorney for the plaintiff,
spurred on by a rancorous text
book author, has every reason to
advise such an appeal. We can

only wait with our confidence
placed in the two unequivocal
victories won and in the ability of
the legal talent employed in our
behalf.
