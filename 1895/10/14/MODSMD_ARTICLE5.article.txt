In one sense the endurance of
those straits through which we have
passed and are still passing has
done us good â€”it has eliminated
the weaker spirits. Those who had
not faith in the stability of the Uni
versity and all that it represents,
those who were not willing to suf
fer and endure for the sake of that
which was to come, have fallen by
the wayside. It is a case of survival
of the fittest; those who remain will
be all the more true and loyal. We
are making University history just
now, and forming University tra
ditions. When the Stanford man
of the future looks back to these
early classes it will be with a sense
of gratitude for the endurance of
those trials which, we firmly believe,
are soon to be a thing of the past.
