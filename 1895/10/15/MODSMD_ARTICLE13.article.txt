It is doubtful if any university
ever graduated a class more loyal
to its alma mater or more fertile in
devices by which her interests are
advanced than the Class of '95.
The latest instance of this is the
formation of the Stanford Lunch
Club in the.city, the work mainly
of '95 men. Such a club as this
has unlimited possibilities for good
in the future. An immediate con
dition of the success of the club is
that undergraduates shall be will
ing and happy to respond to invi
tations to lunch with these old
Stanford men. The pleasure, one
may be sure, will not be at all one
sided.
