Another tennis tournament, the
first of the semester, is in progress,
and judging from the interest
shown, will he one of the most suc
cessful yet held hy the University.
This is certainly as it should he.
Heretofore tournaments at Stan
ford have heen greatly lacking in
this respect. Still with all the ap
parent improvement, it is noticed
that the increase in interest is dis
played mainly hy the players
themselves, and not hy that hody
which more than any other can
contribute to the success of the
game—the spectators. As in all
other sports, it must he admitted
that these have a great deal to do
with the ultimate success of the
game, and any absence of this ele
ment is seriously felt. We can
readily imagine what a dismal
failure football and baseball would
be it not for the enthusiasm
on the side-lines and bleachers
which constantly urges the players
on to greater effort. If is the same
way with tenuis. All could thus
contribute to the interest of the
game by simply showing, through
their presence and applause, their
appreciation of the work that is
being done.

The Examiner said editorially
yesterday :
Why was the test suit brought
against the Stanford estate ? There
are two other estates and ;» living
representative of the men who built
and looted the Central Pacific. Of
the four the Stanford fortune is the
only one from which the gains, law
ful or unlawful, have been returned
to the put>l ie. In the magnificent
foundation of Stanford University
five millions of the Stanford fortune
have already been devoted to pub
lic use. The remainder of the enor
mous accumulation is promised be
fore many years to the same great
purpose. Why, it may be asked,
should the first attack be made
against the fortune that is to go to
the people, while the fortunes that
are held with a tight list in private
keeping are left undisturbed? Was
it that the courts might have the
benefit of the public appreciation of
the Stanford University, of the pub
lic sympathy for Mrs. Stanford's
heroic and self-sacrificing efforts to
keep the institution in operation
under the most trying difficulties, of
the public gratitude for the noble
purposes to which she has an
nounced that she is to devote her
life and her fortune ?
These are some of the questions
that the immediate friends of the
University have been asking over
and over for months past, while the
Eyuminev was engaged in an at
tempt to influence public opinion,
and if possible the courts, in pre
cisely the opposite direction ; to con
vince the people that the future of
Stanford University was in nowise
bound up with the result of the suit.
We are pleased at the accession
of so powerful a friend as the Ex
aminer, yet a few words of encour
agement during the dark period
that has just passed, a few evidences
of a desire to treat our cause fairly,
would have won our gratitude more
easily than can whole columns of
editorial now.
