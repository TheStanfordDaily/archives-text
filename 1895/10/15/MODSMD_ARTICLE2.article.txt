Lust night's practice was unusu
ally good. The men used a great
deal of head work in returning
punts and running interference.
The quarterbacks showed judgment
in giving signals and the punting
was good.
The chief objection to the play
was its slowness. Of two teams
evenly matched in other respects
the team trained to the quickest
play is almost sure to win. As a
rule the teams on this Coast are far
behind the Eastern teams in quick
and snappy work. It should he
made a point this year to put a
Stanford team on the field that
sh:i 11 far surpass any of our former
elevens in this respect.
The spectators last night wit
nessed probably the finest run
made upon the new field. Harry
ileynolds caught the ball near the
center of the field on a punt, and
following the exceptionally good in
terference of Code and l'auly, made
a touchdown.
Overacker and Jack Ileynolds
also made good runs. The other
men put up a stiff game, although
several players missed tackles
which they should ha ve made. (tar
ton, who put up a very stiff game
otherwise, made two very poor
tackles. Like most large men. he
tackles entirely too high. This is
his chief fault, and he should do all
in his power to remedy it.
Some of the new men are show
ing signs of overwork. Two or
ihree promising players have been
compelled to lay off, and others
have worn themselves to a shadow,
through this very cause. A man
who lias had Varsity experience
knows enough to "take it easy"
when he has the chance, while a
player who has not had this ex

perience, become over-anxious and
works himself ''stale." When over
trained a man is much more apt to
be injured, and thus ruins his
chances of making the team.
