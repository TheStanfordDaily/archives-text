# That Protest.

### 
The manager of the '98 football!
team has shown a rather unsports-1
man-like spirit by taking exception j
to the decision of the umpire in |
Saturday's game. He appointed a
committee, consisting of Frost and ;
1 lindsill, to decide the controversy, j
which has arisen over the chain-j
pionship. This committee, to
gether with the adherents of both j
sides, met in room 108 Eneina at
two o'clock today. Anfenger, man
ager of the '90 team, was there and
made strenuous objections to any
such course being pursued. He!
claimed that there was no need of!
a committee. It was finally tie-;
eided to leave it to Umpire Fiekert.!
The latter said that his decision
had been made on the field, after
he had received Mc(luire's word of
honor that he was hurt and that
the game was won by '90 and the
result would so remain.
