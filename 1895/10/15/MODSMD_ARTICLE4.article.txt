# Dixey in the Chapel.

### 
A crowded house received Mr.
Dixey Saturday evening. When the
curtain rose at 8:45 Mr. Dixey
appeared without make-up and
showed a round, smooth, and ani
mated face, with remarkable eyes
and noble features. After some
complaints as to the poor facilities
here for the full scope of his work,
he proceeded to enact the "Seven
Ages of Man'' in brief.
A small table, some incandescent
lights, and a mirror were the only
paraphernalia visible, but by with
drawing his head under the table
fora moment, iie presented succes
ively each character from the in
fant to the old man. After this, a
scene was enacted from "Seven
Ages," in which a number of his
troupe gave excellent representa
tions of old men in various stages
of dotage. The rest of the enter
tainment consisted in specialty
work, including imitations of I lenrv.
Irving, the rural "aimature" ac
tress, the barber-rogue, and Sven
gali. The country was good,
as usual, but a little old, as were a
number of his representations. Mr.
Dixey seemed to go on the supposi
tion that Stanford was a country
district, whose people had never
seen him before. The evening
closed with the time-worn song,
"It's English, quite English, you
know."
One of the most interesting
features was Dixey's " making up"
in full view of the audience.
Many remarks such as "I've
worn off my eyebrows, putting on
Henry Irving's" tended to bring
the audience into close relations
with the actor himself. "Svengali"
deserves special praise. Dixey im
itated aeeuratelyNVilton Lackaye, in
the part, with the difference that
what takes the actor of the Palmer
Co. two hours careful preparation
employs Mr. Dixey but three min
utes.
In spite of the disadvantages of
the place a nd t he counter at tract ion
of the celebration, "Sword and
Sandals" has reason to congratulate
itself on the success of its new de
parture in entertainments.
