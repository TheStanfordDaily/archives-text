llev. ('lias. L. Miel of Sausalito
preached in the chapel Sunday,
from Matthew vii,24: '-Whosoever
heareth these words of mine, and
doeththem, I will liken unto a man
which built his house on a rock."
The words of the text are as
though Christ said to those who
knew not where to turn, " Vou
want some firm ground to stand
upon ; here it is. Take these say
ings of mine and build upon them,
and this foundation will be as solid
rock."
1 wonder if you ever say you are
unsettled by the views of men pro
fessing to be preachers. Yet what
could be plainer than these words.
We often speak of our religious
perplexities as though they were
brand new; no one has ever
touched these shores before, we
fancy. Hut you never had a hard
thought about God that you can
not find the like of it in one or the
other of the Testaments. Read the
Psalms of .Job and you will find
how perplexed and discouraged
their writers were. Men seeking
for the foundation of things, men
struggling in the quagmire of
doubt, trying to get on a rock ; and
Christ says lie is that rock.
If we are ever in doubt
about Clod or about the soul or
about immortality ; if we are ever
perplexed about duty or right and
wrong, why do we not take the
advice of those who have gone
before us, and they will show us
the way to do these things. I wish
we were so shaken by our doubts
that we would not rest until we
had fixed our feet upon something,
at least. What we have to dread
is that condition which is too indo
lent to doubt, and too indifferent
to believe.
There are rising daily the un
seen outlines of that one house
which every soul which has ever
lived is building, either Upon the
solid rock or upon theshifting sand.
We are not conscious of our build
ing this house, for the growth of
conscience is the most subtle thing
in human life.
Mere is a man who has been
building upon the shifting sands—
the sands of selfishness, lie has
never gone down to the bed-rock
and asked what is right, lie wishes
that he we re as strong as other men
who have done right; he wishes that
he had never entered upon this
course. Hut if he ever does get
upon his feet, he finds that his
foundation is built upon the-sand,
and that he cannot learn any other
way.
Thus it is that character is built.
And no wonder when the storms
come such characters are wrecked.
The rains, the floods, and the
sands, with all that these mean
of sickness, sorrow, and misfor
tune. You can build your house
upon the sand, but unless you
have something better for foun
dation, the story of that house
will be short. .Just so are the
wrecks of human lives; the tide
carries wrecks past us every day.
Let us then seriously ask ourselves,
On what foundation are we build
ing ?
Whether you will or not, Clod
has made you a ltuilder ; over
against you as you work, watching

you whether you need him or not,
stands the .Master Kuilder. Ami
this Master Builder, as you work,
speaks to you his words of truth,
and l»ids you work them into the
fabric of your lives. He does not
offer you philosophy or prominence
i for your intellect, but he says,
u Whoever heareth these words of
j mine, lias built upon the rock.
Storms may come, but he will not
1 be moved; floods may come, but be
I will outlast them. For be is
; founded upon the rock, and that
I rock is the Rock of Ages."
