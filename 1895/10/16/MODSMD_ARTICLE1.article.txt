# Walt Whitman.

### 
The lecture on Walt Whitman by
Prof. Hudson was listened to by a
large and appreciative audience at
the chapel last evening. The fol
lowing are a few of the thoughts
presented :
One of the most unfortunate
things that has occurred to Whit
man's works is the fact that, de
spite his exhortation, '' I charge you
that hereafter no one shall try to
explain inc. for I cannot explain
myself; 1 charge you that there
shall he no school founded out of
me," Whitnianism has been raised
to An organized cult. I believe that
in most cases the effect of such a
school is to narrow one's view of the
work and to create intolerance; and
Whitman, of all men. was about the
least capable of standing the tests
of such a school. I wish to make
it clear from the outset, therefore,
that we must be and remain sub
limely unconscious of these soci
eties, should we hope to gain an un
prejudiced view.
Let us consider the subject from
two standpoints : First, what was
it in poetry that Whitman re
garded as his own special mission ?
Second, why was it that, that being
his mission, he failed in it so sig
nally, and so grotesquely ?
First, as to his mission. I would
emphasize theone point upon which
all students of Whitman a re agreed,
that he was a man of extremely
rich, fresh, vital, and magnificent
personality. One of William
Make's admirers said that Make
was a purely new kind of man,and
the same may truthfully be said of
Whitman ; his personality is every
where diffuse of itself; and it is
here that lies the kernel of his
strength. Ilis personality is one
with which the reader comes into
vital and close relation. We get a
very near approach to the real,
genuine heart of the man him
self.
Now,, right here lies the secret of
the work which Whitman tried to
do for American poetry; it was the
hatred of every form of false show
that inspired his efforts, and he
labored to bring American poetry
into close and vital relation with
the forces and aspirations of modern
American life. Every student of
American literature recognizes the
bookish tendency of modern litera
ture â€”literature criticising litera
ture, books about books, full of the
imitative; such has been the
character of American literature
from Washington Irving down.
Evangeline does not exhibit a great
deal of originality, and it has been
said that Longfellow's greatest
poem, the "Song of Hiawatha,"
might just as well have been writ
ten by an author in England, with
a volume of Indian history open at
his side. Hut Whitman saw more
clearly than any other writer of the
time that the tendencies of our
great nineteenth century life were
not only to develop new problems,
but new types of individuality as
well, and that the latter would soon
find their expression in literature.
He further saw that the tendency
was natural and inevitable under
the circumstances in the direction
of merely material development;
that there was a lack of apprecia
tion of ulterior interests. The time

was ripe for some man to bring
harmony out of chaos.
When we consider all this, there
is no doubt that his "attempt to
teach These States to find their
soul" was a noble and magnificent
one. And whatever we may think
of him as a poet, as a thinker he
holds no mean position. Although
not in his style, yet in his manner
of thought he bears an exceedingly
strong resemblance to Matthew
A mold.
Second, as to his complete, gro
tesque failure. Why was.he not
equal to the occasion? In the first
place, fora poet Whitman was al
together too self-conscious. We
can imagine him saying: "Well,
there is no American poetry; I will
make American poetry." But poetry
is not thus created. Whitman is
forever producing svays in which
he is going to do things.
Again, he lost his balance when
lie began his revolt against what he
called "over-aristocratic exclusive
ness,'" and then fell into the error
of over-democratic cxclusiveness.
What further contributed very
largely to his failure was his foolish
extremes in his attitude toward his
own art. He endeavored to throw
off all the conventions of the past,
and when he set himself against
the accumulated experience of the
ages Ik; made an immense blunder.
Whitman furthermore every
where shows an artistic inability to
deal with his material; his style
lacks the a rtistic sea I of immortality.
With all hi> faults, however,
Walt Whitman commands the in
terest of every student of literature
as an author of strong individual
ity and deep thought.
