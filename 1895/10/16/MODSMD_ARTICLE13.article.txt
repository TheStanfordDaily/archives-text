With the training table in full
operation, and two local coaches en
gaged, football affairs are beginning
to assume a business-like aspect.
The practice on the field shows a
gradual improvement, but there is
one fault which must be overcome :
that is, the slowness with which
signals are given. A good, snappy
game should be played from now
on. Most plays lnse ii good propor
tion of their effect if not prosecuted
in a lively manner. No one doubts
that the men this year can put up
a strong game, but no advantage
which fast playing can give should
be allowed to slrp away untried.
If the cardinal is to float above
Berkeley's blue and gold the men
must play a harder game from now
until Thanksgiving. Each player
should feel it a duty to do his very
best, for he thereby forces his op
ponent to follow suit or lose all
chance of making the Varsity.
Experts who have seen all the
big teams at work this year remark
that Stanford is much slower than
any of them. There is surely no
need for this criticism with the ma
terial that we have, and the style of
slow playing should be changed
immediately. Berkeley is playing
an entirely different game than she
lias heretofore. Every signal is
given with astonishing rapidity, and
it is her intent to play a lightning
game. If Stanford wishes to play
thunder to IT.l T . C.'s lightning it is
fully time she should begin a fast
game.
