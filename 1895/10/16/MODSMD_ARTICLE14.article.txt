'â€¢ Iv you hegin to feel dull," snid a
professor who is never dull, to his
< 1 ass a few days ago, " I heg of you
that you lay aside your hook im
mediately ; go out fora walk or a
ride on your hieycle; then come
hack to your hook and you will
learn vour lesson in half the time."

There is more sound wisdom in
this advice than one who has not
followed it would readily believe.
A mistake which many fall into is
the habit of trying to do too much,
and of taking so much work that
they must keep "digging" at their
lessons when their weary brains re
fuse to grasp what is before them.
No profit can come from such
work as this. It is worse than use
less. It weakens the memory in
stead of strengthening it. It may
enable a person to pass off a certain
number of credits, but that person
pays dearly for his credits.
A person might aswell learn first
as last that his powers are limited,
and govern himself accordingly.
Work done in the "wee stria' hours"
is time lost instead of time gained.
Many who do work of this kind
would not think of riding a bicycle
with the screws and nuts loose, but
while they know that good tools
save labor, they fail to consider the
human body in this connection.
There are so many opportunities
offered here that we may well de
spair of taking advantage of but a
small number of them. There is no
excuse fora dissipation of energy
over so much ground. Undertake
little and do it well. The social ad
vantages of a college life should not
be lost sight of in the mad rush for
knowledge. Above all, the student
who is wise will keep the cobwebs
out of his brain by taking plenty of
exercise and, what is of greatest
importance to the student, plenty
of sleep.
