# The 						Aftermath.

### 
Private advice received here an
nounces the to-he-expected news
that Mrs. Stanford, who went East
a few days ago, is receiving an
avalanch of telegrams congratulat
ing her on winning the big Govern
ment suit against the Stanford
estate and saving the # 15,000,000
to the University.
Such congratulations will un
doubtedly crowd upon her for
months as she meets friends of her
self and of the Stanford University
East and West. She has a host of
warm and influential friends at
Washington who became friends of
the late Senator and herself during
their long connection with the
official and social life of the capi
tal, and many Senators and Con
gressman have wished her success
—for the University's sake, at
least—and stood ready to vote for
any bill remitting the millions re
covered if the (iovernment won the
suit. Then this institution here,
broadly planned and run, and
marking the farthest advance to
ward intellectual freedom and the
idea of individual education among
the world's institutions of learning,
has a steadily increasing number
of admirers who would deeply re
gret a blow that would cut short at
the outset its career of magnificent
promise.
There is widespread personal
sympathy for Mrs. Stanford, ton,
among those who understand a
little of the heroic struggle and the
devoted and self-sacrificing labors
which she has bestowed on the
University since Senator Stanford's
death. She took the management
of the vast estate at the time of
greatest business depression, and
found it tangled and able to yield
very little money. Since that time
she has abandoned every social
pleasure, devoted herself to busi
ness early and late, displayed sur
prising strength of character and
business ability, brought rigid
economy into play everywhere,
even making her personal and
household expenses less than those
of many fairly well-to-do residents
of the Western Addition, and has
supported the University largely
from her private fortune. Since
the filing of the (iovernment suits
not a dollar of the estate could be
used, and cannot be until the Pro
bate Court here orders the distribu
tion of the est ite. The (iov.ru
inent suit has alone stood in the
way of that fora year or more. —
