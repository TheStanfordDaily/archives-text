# U. C. Practice as We See It.

### 
Butterworth has already suc
ceeded in inspiring the Berkeley
football men with a feeling of en
thusiasm and confidence such as
they never had before. The belief
is gradually growing among the
students as a whole that their team
with Lutterworth's coaching will
be able to defeat Stanford on
Thanksgiving. .Judging from the
way the men go about their work
they certainly have some reason
for hope.
Last night's practice was an in
dication of what kind of work the
men will be put through for some
time to come. Owing to the drill
the men did not come out till late.
They came into the field in a body,
about thirty-five in number. This
theatrical mode of entry is one of
Lutterworth's schemes to arouse
general enthusiasm. As soon as
they reached the field they began
passing and catching the ball.
After a few minutes of this the first
and second elevens practiced sig
na Is.
Lutterworth seemed to be every
w here, I>estowing advice, | >raise. and
reproof in all directions. His con
stant exhortation was to play quick
and hard, and when the two teams
lined up, they did plav quick and
hard. The signals were given
quickly, often before the men were
on their feet, and the ball was put
in play at once. Every man on
the team seemed to receive Lutter
worth's individual notice. Not a
single bad play or faulty position
escaped his notice and he was
down on the offender at once. He
illustrated plays not only by word,
but by example. W hen he told a
guard to go through, he would show
him how to do it and be never
failed to go through no matter how
hard the opposing guard resisted.
With him on the field it seems
impossible for any one to shirk.
He gets all out of the men that is
in them. He has already suc
ceeded in developing fairly good in
terference and team work, but the
fact that many of the men are new
handicaps him greatly.
