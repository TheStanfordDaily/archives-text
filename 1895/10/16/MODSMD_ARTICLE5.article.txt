In spite <>112 the threatening
weather there was a good-sized
crowd to watch the practice yester
day.
.McMillan was on hand and ma
terially aided the scrubs in making
a touchdown. He played left half,
and bucked the line in line shape.
After he had dropped out, the lirst
team had a much easier time with
their opponents.
•lack Reynolds showed, better
than words ever can, the advantage
of catching the ball on the fly. He
made two magnificent runs on
catches from punts. It would be
well if the other players- did not
wait for the ball to strike the
ground. It is much safer to catch
the ball, ami the impetus gained in
running up, will carry the runner
a good distance.
Cochran made a splendid run,as
did llarry Reynolds.
I la rrington and Fickert, at guard,
fought a battle royal. Thomas and
.lames, on 1 he other side of center,
played out so far that either one
would break through, when his side
was on the aggressive. James got

| through so often, in the last part of
j the game, that the second team was
unable to punt at all. Overacker
j was somewhat to blame for this, he
| cause he did not protect the fit li
| backs as he should have done.
