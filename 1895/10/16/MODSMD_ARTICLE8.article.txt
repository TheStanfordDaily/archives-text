# List For "As You Like It."
## 
### 
Special efforts are to be made
between now and Saturday to ob
tain the six hundred names neces
sary to insure tlie performance of
"As You Like It." The greatest
effort will he made to reach every
I person in the vicinity of the Uni
| versity; still there are many who
| though desirous of subscribing will
] not be seen. If these will take it
upon themselves to hunt up some
I one with a list, they will confer a
I great favor upon the Annual.
There is not the slightest doubt of
i the success of the performance, if it
can only be brought here. The
; lists will be closed Saturday, bv
which time the fate of the enter
prise will be known.
