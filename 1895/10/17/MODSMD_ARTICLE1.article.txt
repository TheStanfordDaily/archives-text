# The 						Stanford Lunch Club of San Francisco.
## 
### 
Mention has already been made
in the Daily Palo Alto of the
Stanford Lunch Club recently
organized in San Francisco. The
club had its second meeting last
Saturday at Frank's restaurant
and was well attended. This place!
lias been selected as the regular
place of meeting in the future
every Saturday at the noon
hour. There are about thirty men
in San Francisco who have the
qualifications fur membership. |
Kuch member must be a Stanford I
man and either be located in San !
Francisco or vicinity in business or!
as a student or have the intention
of being so at an early date. The
dub's object at present is the pre- !
servation of those warm sympathies
that characterize the early classes I
in the I'niversity, and the con-1
tinned interest in the alma Micr's
welfare that results naturally from j
such fellowship. The club is really j
considered the nucleus of a regu- i
larly organized Stanford Club some i
time in the future which shall ;
eventually have its own rooms,etc., j
and be the regular University j
gathering place in the city. With
the present size of the alumni such
an organization as that just formed
is the only one possible.
The boys meet at the restaurant,
where they have a large room to I
themselves, the table decorated, and :
a piano with the aid of which the!
ex-students try to keep up to date |
iu the inatterof Stanford songs. The
club is a congenial one naturally,!
and Saturday's lunch, it is safe to!
say, is about the jollies! meal of the 1
week to each of the fellows. Foot
ball is, of course, the prevailing;
topic, and the different authorities!
around the table are listened to j
with respectful eagerness. Last
Saturday's lunch tasted particu
larly good, seasoned with the news
of the recent decision, and the club
shared in the general student cele-1
bration as best it could.
Any Stanford fellow may be
brought to lunch by any member!
of the club, and will be heartily
welcomed. It is expected that ac-1
tive students will be brought in
in this way, and the news they give,:
fresh from college, will do much to
keep the club in touch with the!
I'niversity,and thus realize the ob
ject of its organization.
Those who have joined in the,
idea thus far are Sheehan, Field,
Harrelson, Van Denburgh, Buck, |
(futh, Stewart, Knowles, Kllery, j
(irosh, DeLong, Cotton, Painter,
Adams, Clayton, and (fray.
