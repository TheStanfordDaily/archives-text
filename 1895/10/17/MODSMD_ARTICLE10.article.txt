have their first chance of the season
to show what they can do in con
test with a team whose men and

tice. These early games are of im

nish the data fora knowledge of its
weakness and its strength to an ex
tent that practice with the second 1
eleven never can.

team and to the management this
first practice game should arouse
the enthusiasm of the students in
general. The grand-stand should
be filled, and the Stanford yell
should be heard not less frequently
than were the class yells last Satur
day.
