# Chicago's Eleven.
## 
### 
The football team of the Univer
sity of Chicago has been in traili
ng ever since August 25. Candi
dates for the team are given daily
practice on Marshall Field from 4
to 6.
The ragged points in the team
have been carefully watched by the
eoaehers during the practice games
with different Chicago high schools
and when they lined up against the
star aggregation from the Chicago
Athletic Club last Saturday the
only noticeable weak spot was full
back, which Carr Neel, the tennis
champion, endeavored to fill but
failed. The Athletic Club suffered
defeat by a score of <S to ()—two
touch-downs —Neel failing to kick
the goal.
Phil. Allen, the famous Williams
player, is taking post graduate
work and will play center. He is
said to be the superior of any man
in the West with the exception <>112
Stevenson of the C. A. C. "Old
War 1 lorse" Allen will captain the
team and play right guard, which
position he has tilled for several
years.
There are' several promising
candidates for left guard, but thus
far Kuhlkoetter seems to have the
best of it. Flint will play left tackle
and Williamson, the new man from
Ohio, has shown up splendid for
the other side, his work in Satur
day's game being very brilliant.
< iale and Koby will occupy the
ends. Both might be improved
At the beginning of the season
considerable anxiety was felt about
the possibility of securing a
quarter-back, but Henry Clarke,
the famous pitcher and all-around
ball player, has shown up so well
in practice that he is regarded as :i
fixture. He passes the ball quickly
and is a heady player. For halves
Chicago has two of the best in the
West, Nichols and Fwing, both all
around athletes, who know the
game.
The only weak position is full
back, which has not been filled so
far, and if better candidates do not
appear Chicago may secure Hrown
of the Athletic Club, who tilled the
position so well for Cornell.
Among the promising substitutes
are Pike, Rowers, and Winston.
F. L. Butlerworth has had charge
of the team during Prof. Stagg's ill
ness. The team will play several
of the Western colleges and then go
Fast, finishing the season ;it Chi
cago on Thanksgiving day with!
Michigan as an opponent.-- I'.ofM.
