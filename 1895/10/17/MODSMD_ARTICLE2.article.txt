The plav was very slow. This is
the chief objection to the work and
should be remedied as soon :is pos
sible. The <|iia rler-bneks are not the
only ones to blame for the delay in
giving the signals and putting the

ball in play. A .quarter-back can-1
not give the signals when the men J
are strung out across the field.
To develop snappy team work, j
all the men must be ready to take I
their positions at the instant the
ball is down —in other words,every
player should follow the ball.
Another weak point is the way j
most of the men fall on the ball.)
It is a great deal safer to drop on :
the ball ami down it than to attempt
to pick it up on the run and take
the chances of fumbling it.
' Ileffellinger" Williams played
guard on the Scrub and got through ,
the line repeatedly. .James, who!
played opposite him, tackled well
but has not yet learned to play in
close to center.
Webster, a new man, did very!
well as guard. With experience he !
should make a good showing.
Garton opened up holes in the
center so well that Weldon was able
to gain a great deal through that
position.
Eminett did some good playing!
at end. 11 is strong point is getting
down the field on a punt. Frank-j
enheimer took his place in the last |
part of the game and tackled very]
well.
The best runs around the ends I
were made by Plate, Dole, and I
Spalding. .Just before tin* end of |
play the latter made a magnificent;
run of thirty yards.
Code ran excellent interference]
and passed well. Mcintosh used j
good judgment in giving the signals j
and was in every play.
