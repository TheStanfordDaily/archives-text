It is hoped that when the suit is
finally decided in our favor, we will
have not only a holiday, but a
promenade concert, in which new
students may setf, and old ones see

bathed in moonlight, redolent with
perfume, and resounding with mu
sic.

more lit ting thanksgiving fora
blessing than the din of tin-pans
and the hoarse shouts of crowds.
