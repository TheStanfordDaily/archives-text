# WALTER CAMP COMING.
## He Is Due to Arrive, and Will Remain Until After the Big Game. 
### 
The announcement was made
this afternoon that Walter Camp
will coach the Stanford players this
year. He left New Haven with his
wife and son on the 12th inst. and
will arrive here probably tomorrow,
though the management cannot
state definitely, inasmuch as they
are ignorant of the route selected by
Mr. ( a nip.
During his stay here Mr. Camp
will stop at Mrs. Morton's and will
board at the training table. He
will be with the men constantly
and expects to remain at Stanford
University until the game with
Berkeley.
The life of ("amp is so well known
that it is almost unnecessary to re
iterate its features. The following
brief account of the '' Father of
Football" may, however, be of in
terest.
Cam]) was born April 7, ISo'.l,
and at an early age developed a
ma rked aptitude for out door sports.
At Hopkins (irammar School he
was elected captain of the school
eleven. When seventeen years old,
be entered Vale and graduated in
IKBO, receiving both junior and sen
ior appointments, lie was captain
of both the freshman football and
baseball teams, and made a half on
the Varsity in his freshman year.
HI very year for six years he played
on the Vale team; taking a position
on every occasion that Yale lined
up against Harvard and Princeton
during that time. In his junior
and senior years he captained the
Varsity eleven.
Cam]) never approved of grad
uate captains and so resigned when
elected captain after his graduation.
In his senior year Camp served as
baseball captain of the Varsity
nine.
He rowed on his class crew, won
the high hurdles in his sophomore
year, and was one of Yale's repre
sentatives in the tirst intercollegiate
tenuis tournament.
From the inception of modern
college football Walter Camp has
been a firm adherent of the game,
and his influence on the sport has
been highly beneficial. Many of
the most potent rules of the game
are (lamp's handiwork, for he has
aided in the compilation of the rules
ever since his graduation.
For several years Camp has been
Vale's chief coach, and to him is
awarded the praise for many of
''Old Eli's" victories. Excepting
Yale, no college has ever received
the benefit of this master's coach
ing but Stanford. He has always
taken a great interest in this T Di
versity, and to aid it as well as to
aid the game of football in the
West, Camp has again consented
to supervise the work of the play
ers here.
In New Haven Mr. Camp is con
nected with one of the largest watch
manufactories of the V nited States.
So closely has his business occu
pied his attention that he has
been forced to give up active work
with the Yale men. It may give
some idea of his interest in Stan
ford, that be is willing to coach its
players when he has declined that
work with the eleven of Yale.
