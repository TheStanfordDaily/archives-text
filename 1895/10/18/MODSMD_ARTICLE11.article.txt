Phomably the larger portion of a
university's influence on the pro
gress of the people is generally over
looked. Ordinarilv we think of this

benefit as accruing almost wholly
to the individuals who share im
mediately in its instruction ; hut in
reality, the direct influence that
spreads out through the whole so- j
cial structure far exceeds in mass!
the total of direct results.
This is most easily seen in the in- 1
fluenee of a university upon sec-1
ondary education. No one thing is
so great an incentive to superior
work in preparatory schools as the
standard required for admission to
the university which those schools
feed. Every time this standard is
raised it affects the character of the
work done in the lower schools; this
influence is in turn transmitted to
the lower grades. In general every
child in the public schools is some
what affected by the change, those
in the upper grades decidedly so.
Only a small percent, of the school
population enter college, yet the
whole is distinctively better edu
cated because of the existenee-of the
university. If we take into account
the hitter's share in the general ad
vance of learning the effect upon
public school education is enhanced
still more.
