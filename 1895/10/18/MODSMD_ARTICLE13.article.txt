# The
						Training Table.
## 
### 
The candidates for the team who
have gained admittance to the
training table may congratulate
themselves upon the excellent way
in which the table is managed this
year. Unlike former years, the
table is in a pleasant situation and
each man has ample room.
Great credit is due Mr. Tate for
his efforts in giving the men the
best to be had. He keeps flowers
upon tlie table, and the waiters
who look after the wants of the
football men are first class. In
fact, he does everything in bis
power to give satisfaction.
The meal hours are, breakfast,
from <> to S: 30; lunch, at 12:4~>,
and dinner at (>: 81).
Captain Cochran sits at the head
of the table and keeps a watchful
eye upon his subordinates. On
either side of him is the Dutch
colony, where sit the linguists of
the team. The other men sit on
either side of the long table, which
is placed in the southwest corner of
the Encina dining room.
For breakfast ihe men are given
fruit, mush, rare beefsteak or lamb
chops, vegetables, chocolate, milk,
and oatmeal water. The fare for
lunch differs little from that of the
morning.
The menu for dinner is, soup,
rare roast beef, vegetables, toast,
crackers, rice pudding and fruit,
with oatmeal water and rich miik
to drink.
This is the order for one day and
shows in a general way what is al
lowed. Of course there are changes
from day to day to give variety.
