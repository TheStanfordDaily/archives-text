The field, though u little hard
j underneath, had been newly har-
I rowed and was in good shape for
: yesterday's practice. Both teams
; played a close, hard game and in
genera 11he practice was satisfactory.
The interference was not up to that of
I the preceding day and the punting
was poor. The first team played
an end game and made most of
their gains in that way, while the
second team's play consisted almost.
1 entirely in line bucking.
A much snappier game than
i usual was shown. Capt. Cochran
: gave the signals for his side and
j seemed to put more life into his
men. ()11 the other side Mcintosh
rattled off the signals more quickly
j than has been his habit. But the
! play must be gingered up far more
I before it is up to the standard
which will be set this year. The
i men should be sufficiently hardened
| by this time to stand fora short
time at least a succession of fast
| plays.
I lolbrook played qua iter fora few
moments on the first team, but
was compelled to retire early on ac
count of his injured knee. Me
-1 Intosh, who played quarter for the
scrubs, was in every play and made
some star tackles.
(jiarton and Carle held down the
center positions. Carle seemed to
j put up a stronger defense than
| usual against his stalwart vis-a-vis.
Williams, hist year's center, is
j doing excellent work. lie is in
prime condition and is buckling
| down with a will. He lias been
out but three times and has not
had an opportunity to show what
| lie can do against a strong adver
sary, but judging from the aggres
i ive game he has shown he should
| make a hard tussle for one of the
: places next to center.
The only really long run of the
| practice was made by Harry Rey-
I nolds oil a catch. Dole and
j Frakenheinier played a strong de
i tensive game, getting through the
| line and breaking up the interfer
ence repeatedly. If the line men
I would play more closely together
and not leave such gaps in the line
j tlu ;re would not be so many tackles
I made behind the line.
Cochran put up his usual game
lat tackle. The other tackles ap
peared far too slow and were sel
â–  dom in the plays,
i Leavitt. and Frazier did some
very good tackli .
