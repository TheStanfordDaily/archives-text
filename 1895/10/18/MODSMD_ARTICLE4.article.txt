# Football Tomorrow.
## 
### 
The game tomorrow between
Stanford and the Olympics will
be more in the nature of a practice
than a hard match game. Cap
tain Cochran desires to try as many
men in different positions as pos
sible and has arranged no line-up.
Code will be unable to play, and as
1 lolbrook is suffering from a
sprained knee, Mcintosh will prob
ably play quarterback.
