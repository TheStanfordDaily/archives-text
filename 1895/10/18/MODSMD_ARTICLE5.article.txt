Lester F. Ward was horn in I<S4'2,
j fought in the Civil War. and ob
tained a position in the Treasury |
I department where he remained j
until 1883. In the meantime he j
had become a botanical expert, and
j had published his great work on
j Dynamic Sociology, which is un
doubtedly the greatest contribution
of America to that science. In
11881 he became a paleobotanist of!
j the geological survey. In 1893 he!
; published l> The Psychic Factors of j
Civilization." Ilis lecture this |
afternoon was an analysis of
Benjamin Kidd's " Social Evolu
tion," and was in substance as fol
lows:
For my own part I am disposed
J to look very favorably on the whole
! book; therefore, if my remarks are
i in the nature of criticism it is I»e
-j cause I deem it unnecessary to
I dwell on the good points of the!
i book; for I presume there is no one I
< who has not read it. I welcome the'
i book heartily, and I believe it is
| destined to do a great good. But
I am obliged to attribute its useful
ness to what I regard as an error
in the book itself. The way Ihisj
error will do good is by populariz-'
I ing a book which has much good 1
j in it.
W'e all'know the powerful hold j
I that religion bason mankind. No!
matter how true a doctrine may be,!
if it goes against religion it will!
I not be accepted. Therefore one who'
j has a great truth to inculcate is:
; justified in using this vehicle. 1
'This is what Kidd has done. II
will not attempt to set forth the!
I teachings of this book; suffice it loj
j say that it declares the inevitable |
! solution of the problems of the race
to be in the direction of social
j equably. He attributes all pro
gress t«> religion, and the intelligent
reader will perceive that by religion
he means something different from
the ordinary meaning of that word;
j the critic will perceive its true
I meaning, but the unthoughtful
readers will perceive neither the
j one nor the other.
> What then is his conception of

religion as the ])rime motive of all
social evolution ? llis first reason
ing is from biology; he recognizes
man's descent from the ancestral
age, and that man's descent bus
been a constant struggle for sur
vival. He lays stress on the care
nature takes for the preservation of
the race ; and he applies this same
law to the human race, arid affirms
that not only must this struggle
continue to the end, but man must
continue to observe these laws ot
self-preservation. The laws of mar
riage are pointed to as examples of
the ways in which the decrees of re
ligion were inculcated as a means
of social progress. The answer to
this is simple. It is that religion is
a product of reason. Mr. Kidd
gives a number of definitions of re
ligion. I>ut he fails to give the mini
mum definition, namely: belief in
spiritual beings. Me quotes Mux
lev's remark that there are plenty
of religions without (iods, but none
without ghosts.
I will now pass to bis second
contention, namely: that there is
no sanction for social progress; that
the interests of the individual are
not those of organism. Mere he
takes the purely biological stand
point, and he labors to show that
the individual guided by reason
alone will not do this. The indi
vidual works for himself; this is
true even of intelligent people.
Me develops this alongtwo lines:
first, that without the aid of re
ligion the race cannot increase;and
second, that without religion there
could be no improvement in the
masses. Mr. Kidd shows that cul
tivated people have fewer children
than uncultivated ; the law that he
makes is that society is recruited
from the base.
The essential condition of a
moral idea is the power of repre
sentation of the ideas of others.
The degree to which it will be dis
played depends on other things.
Altruism is powerless until it
reaches a point where it overcomes
egoism. You will therefore see
tliat it requires a great deal of al
truism to overcome the feeling of
self. I prefer to say that progress
is due to the growth of intelligence.
We shall find that moral progress
will just about keep pace with the
growth of intelligence.
Take the case of slavery for an
example. The most revolting form
of slavery the world has ever known
was in force in the United States;
and the church was found to be the
great bulwark of slavery. The
only sects that opposed slavery were
the non-evangelical sects. The
abolition of slavery under such
circumstances was really an in
evitable result; it was the result of
intelligence, not of religion.
So Kidd's argument grows
weaker and weaker as it goes on,
having made a definition of relig
ion of his own, which makes it
practically altruism. Me calls
everything that is good religion.
In opposition to Kidd then, I
would maintain that the pro
gress of ideas and social amelior
ation has been due to intelligence.
