The chances seem propitious for
another visitation from an Eastern
college team. Two good elevens are
desirous of visiting the Coast, and
all the best teams in this State will
probably unite in arranging for
games with one of these organiza
tions. The University of Michigan
and the University of Minnesota
are being negotiated with in refer
ence to a Western tour. If either
does come, Stanford will again be
pitted against a good Eastern eleven,
with every prospect of administer
ing another defeat. It is to be sin
cerely hoped that the negotiations
will go through.
