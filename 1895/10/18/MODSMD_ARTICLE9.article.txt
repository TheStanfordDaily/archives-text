Few of the students realize the
advantage to be derived from origi
nal work done in history or other
departments. Thesis work gives
an opportunity fora branch of
work full of the most bountiful re
turns to those who undertake it
with a will. One becomes familiar
with reference books in general
and, what is more, intimate with
those pertaining directly to his
subject. The practical work of se
lection, deduction, and finally se
quence of construction, is in itself a
valuable training. The knowledge
which one acquires in this way will
prove, through its deliniteness and
unity of arrangement, of more than
ordinary value.
