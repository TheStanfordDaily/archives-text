At last it is definitely settled
that we are to have the out-door
performance of "As You Like It."
In the Escondite grounds, a lit set
ting for Shakspere's most pleasing
comedy, our lovers of the drama
may while away an afternoon with
tender Rosalind and the melan
choly Jacques, and that "wise fool 1 '
louchstone. It is a rare opportun
ity for the stay-at-homes to witness
a first class play without expend
ing time and money in a trip to the
city. Doubtless a large audience
will he " under the greenwood tree"
to spend an afternoon with the
merry exiles of Arden forest.
