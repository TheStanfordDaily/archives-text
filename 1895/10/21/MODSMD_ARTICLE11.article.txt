" Three cheers for Walter Camp." !
Such was the first greeting which !
"our best friend outside the Univer-1
sity" received this year from the 1
student body. This expression of
enthusiasm from the crowd that
waited for Mr. Camp on the steps |
of Encina meant more than the re
ception of the supreme guardian of
this year's football interests; it was!
rather a welcome to an old friend j
who has stood by us in everything, 1
who has sacrificed his own interests
repeatedly to ours.
Mr. Camp never showed better j
his devotion to our best interests
than when he said to a Call cor-1
respondent, "I shall endeavor to!
establish a feeling of friendly riv
alry between Stanford and Berk
eley." Now it pertains to our wel
fare to firmly establish such a spirit
in the two great universities of the
Pacific Coast. No amount of sue-1
eessful football coaching could j
mean so much to us as such a ser
vice.
One feature of our football prac-1
tice conspicuous for its absence is j
the encouragement given good pfflys j
bv the spectators. The beneficial
effect of vigorous cheering on the |
general play of a team has been i
proven in many a game. There
seems to be nothing which puts viiu !
and vigor into a wearied eleven
like the repeated shouts of on
lookers.
The Stanford yell would become
as extinct as the dodo, were there
not certain occasions that abso
lutely demanded its use. A chance
for perfecting our yell occurred lastj
Saturday when Stanford was push- j
ing the Olympic team all over the
gridiron, yet not a single Stanford

I chirp was heard. The depressing
effect of such a sullen silence on
I the part of Stanford spectators
| must certainly have been felt by
| the team. Such coldness has never
been a peculiarity of collegians, and
| there is no need to make it a char
acteristic of Stanford students.
