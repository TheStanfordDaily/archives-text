# Stanford's Players as Camp Sees Them.

### 
" From what 1 saw of the players
in the Olympic- game last Satur
day," said Camp, "1 think the
boys do n«t play an aggressive
game. Their defensive work was
about what I expected to see and
perhaps a trifle better, but at
ground gaining plays the men
were weak, due to lack of inter
ference. It seemed as though a
man felt satisfied when .he simply
broke through the opposing line or
held his opponent, instead of which
the player should get into every
move made by his team.
"The material seemed to be
plentiful and I guess we will be
able to pick out a good eleven."
Regarding the line the coach was
well satisfied with its appearance.
'•There seems to be no lack of big
men for guards and center, which
is one point in our favor."
"Punting will be a very im
portant feature of the game this
year and 1 am sorry to find no
long distance kicker here. In that
respect Berkeley will have an ad
vantage over us. Last season
while they could out-punt us, and
practically made all their gains by
that method after the first live
minutes play, still we played just
enough of a punting game to bother
them. It is hardly probable we
could play the same game on U. C.
again."
Speaking of the training, Cam])
said he would go on about as
Cochran had begun without great
variation. "Practice games are
about all we can give the men. - '
The father of football looked
rather serious at the mention of an
hour's practice daily. "We'll have
to arrange it so as to give the eleven
more time for lield work," said
Cam]). "Instead of beginning at o
p.m. the men should be ready to
line ii]» not later than 4:80 each
afternoon. An hour and a half or
two hours is a plenty short enough
period daily from now on if the
candidates are in earnest.
"It appears tome that the men do
not play with suflicient vigor, ' as
serted the coach, "especially thel>ig
men; nor is the play of the snappy
order that all the big Eastern

elevens will play this year; but
this can be remedied, by earnest
work."
From Mr. Camp's general con
versation il was easy to see that lie
could find much to be improved,
yet was not discouraged at all, for
he also found some features to com
mend. lie believed that it was a
little too soon afterarrival to justly
comment on the players, but laid
special stress on the need of more
aggressive, snappy work.
('amp greatly desires to build up
a second eleven for the good of
future years.
