The: Sunday morning sermon
was delivered by Rev. S. 11. W'eller
of Long lira noli upon the subject,
"Love as an impelling motive.''
The following are a lew of the
thoughts presented:
All men are impelled by certain
motives, and in these motives can
we read the character of the man;
and if he is an active man he will
have some strong, ruling motive.
Paul's ruling motive was love,
particularly love for Christ. A
study of Pa ill's life with this motive
of his in mind will disclose a num
ber of facts of universal application
to character.
First, love, pure and simple,goes
very far toward the imal solution
of many of the diflhuhies of social
life, li is not restraint or force,
but love that builds up society.
About the lirst thing that attracts
our attention when we enter upon
the threshold of life is the glitter of
gold, and it continues thenceforth
to hold out to us the advantages of
worldly gain; it disregards the im
portance of character, hut promises
the satisfaction of every want and
desire. Love, in its purity and
simplicity, also bids us seek gains,
but gains which far from being
temporal will accrue richly to our
advantage throughout the eternal
ages.
Moreover, love in the individual
soul possesses what may be called
a strong architectural element;- it
above all other forces serves to
build ii]» the solid structure of a
human character —a structure of
(»od that is not made with hands.
No character can be symmetrical
and useful in a high degree with
out the abundant presence of love.
The greatest work of a human
being is the creation of a magnifi
cent eternity. Our faith in the
character and meaning of this
eternity may at times beclouded
with doubts, but it at any rate gives
us something of high ideal toward
which to direct our (iod-given
energy. The agnostic offers us ab
solutely nothing.
