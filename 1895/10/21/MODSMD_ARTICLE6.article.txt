# Stanford 4, Olympics O.
## 
### 
Walter Camp arrived in time
Saturday to see his pupils-to-be
I make a poor showing against an
I outside team. The outcome of the
| Stanford-Olympic practice game
was not such as to give any great
I amount of encouragement to the
| great coach. As far as the score is
I concerned the game was a little
i better than the first one witnessed
j by Mr. Camp last year. But it is
! doubtful if the work, on the whole,
! was as good as that of the first
Stanford-Reliance game of the sea-
I son of '94. The team we faced
j then was a much stronger team
than our opponents of Saturday.
W alter Camp was loath to ex
press an opinion of the game, but
| remarked that Stanford's defensive
! work was much better than the ag-
Igressive. lie also said that he was
I a little more encouraged at the
prospects than he was on his ar
| rival last year.
Although the weather was decid
edly threatening a large crowd as
sembled on the held long before the
jcall of time. lOven when the rain
, began to fall in the second half the
| people sat in their seats and stood
along the side-lines until their
l clothes were rather damp,
i It is doubtful if any of the spec-
I tators felt repaid for the expense
land inconvenience they were corn
| pelled to put up with in order to
watch t he game.
The playing was loose, slow, and
there was very little interference.
The crowd, although very large,
j considering the state of the weather,
! was not such as to inspire a team
| to noble effort. It was more like a
| matinee audience at a theater than
a college crowd at a ball game.
' Once in a while,when a particularly
i good play was made, a faint veil
1 would go up from the onlookers,
! but at ihe time when things were
! not "coming our way"—the time
I when the eleven needed encourage
j ment —there was not a sound to be
heard unless some particularly
reckless individual happened to let
out a whoop, when he was imme
diately laughed at by his neigh
bors. lihere was no college spirit
displayed.
As the game was virtually a. prac
tice game, the ha Ives were limited to
fifteen minutes each. It is doubt
ful if the Olympic men could have
I stood a longer game, for they were
j not at all in training.
Captain Smith won the toss and
j took tiie ball. Stanford took the
i west goal.
! The Olympics kicked off for
I twenty yards. Stanford got the
; ball and made short gains by run
j ningthe halfbacks around the ends,
i Weldon tried to kick, but the ball
| was blocked by an Olympic man.
! Olympics gained possession of the
! pig-skin but lost it, without gain,
j on an offside play. Jack Reynolds
j went around the end fora ten-yard
! gain. The ball was logt to Olym
pics on a fumble. This was the first
fumble of the game, and it would
have been much better for both
sides if it had been the last. This
was one of the weak points in our
play. The men would fumble the
hall at times when there was very
little excuse for it.
I Olympics failed to advance in
' three downs and fumbled, but liar

rison regained the ball but was
tackled by Spalding after a ten
yard gain. Stanford was given the
ball on downs and, after a vain at
tempt at bucking, Weldon punted
for twenty yards.
The Olympics fumbled again,
and Mcintosh fell on the ball.
Olympics got the ball on downs,
but when an attempt to punt was

By a series of bucks the ball was
carried to Olympics'two and a half

On the third down with two yards
and a half to gain a wedge was
formed and Jack Reynolds was
given the ball. He was downed
with the ball a foot from Olympics'
goal. Olympics' ball. Theuerauf
tried to punt, but Cochran and
Fickert, by the same sort of work
that won our last Thanksgiving
game, got through and blocked the
ball. Frankenheimer touched it
down. Score: Stanford 4, Olympic

For the rest of the game the ball
was in Olympic territory and Stan
ford nearly made a touch-down
when Mcintosh picked the ball up
on a fumble and ran down the
field to within ten yards of the line
where he was stopped. This might
have increased the long end of the
score, had there been a little more
interference for the runner. To
ward the end of the game Harry
Reynolds, by a splendid tackle,
stopped one of the San Franciscans'
runs which would have probably
ended in a touch-down.
McNear did the best work for
Olympic, while Kidd and Har
