# MRS. BALLINGTON BOOTH
## Explains the Workings of the Salvation Army. 
### 
I always feel it a great pleasure
to address such an audience as
this one. I have spoken in many
of the cities of the East and J
always find that 1 do not have to
go outside of my audience in order
to get inspiration.
The Salvation Army means a
great deal to me ; it came into my
lite when 1 had no special desire
for the future. It came to me
though I was an open church mem
ber ever since my baptism; but i
found when it came to me that it
found me just as much in need of
it as the poor drunkard in the gut
ter. It brought me not a mere
creed or faith or notion, but it
brought to me a real personal Sav
ior. As 1 have travelled from
country to country and have gone
down among all those who most
need, I have felt that there was no
movement so real as the Salvation
Army. There is no movement to
day that has gone through more
misunderstanding than the Sal
vation Army. It is impossible for
me to explain to you the many
things that seem t<> you to make
this movement so different from
other movements. I cannot stand
here and tight the battles of many
of the things which seem peculiar,
but I can say this, that there is
nothing in the Salvation Army
which 1 would change.
The spirit of the Salvation Army
is such a spirit that the Army has
in it that which will do more in
lifting the ways of the people and
bringing the people nearer to God
than any other movement. I know
many of the criticisms which exist,
but I can say that I can give a
good answer to everything that the
Salvation Army does. But what
the people want is fo believe that a
broad-minded view must be taken,
and that a movement must not he
judged from our standpoint, but
from the wide standpoint of the
world.
The Salvation Army saw the
need of a people who would he will
ing to go out and do anything and
suffer anything for the Master's
sake —he who has taken us with
all our sin and our miserable little
lives, and has filled our hearts and
our lives with peace. There is room
in the Salvation Army for physical
strength and brains; and there is
"room also for all the hearts who
can go out and touch the hearts of
others.
I often wish when L am talking
to a fashionable audience where
there is no interest in doing any
thing for the outside world—l feel
as if 1 should like to take them and
plant them down in a red-hot
meeting of the Salvation Army in
the slums.
We are going to take our work
wherever it is needed. You know j
the work is for the poor ; that does ;
not mean the poor in worldly goods,
it means those who are poor in
Christ. We believe in the Salva
tion Army, that wherever there is a i
heart that can be touched, wherever >
there is a soul that can be helped,
that it is the business of the Salva- j
tion Army to go to them and help |
them. Our church, our work is to

go to the black sheep; our church is
the church of the black sheep; un
derneath the black wool there is
ever found a good, warm heart.
We have different phases of work.
There is, first, our Corps work,
which you would call mission work.
We send our officers into a city or
town and in these they open up
a hall and begin the work. There
is one thing that we are thankful
for, and that is that we speak to
crowds; we go out on the streets to
get our audience and we nearly al
ways get the audience we want.
We very often get in men who are
drunk, and we do not mind that;
sometimes they disturb us, but we
can manage them, and very often
they go away sober.
Our second field of work is relief
work. In this we are very success
ful, for we have the power of God
with us. Social work attempted
without the power of God will be
useless, because it only touches the
external man, and unless you
touch the internal man he will
be drawn back into the quagmire
of sin.
The third, and perhaps the most
important field of work, is that
known as slum work. Young girls
leave their homes and go down into
the slums; it is not a temporary
service, but they give up their
whole life to this work. Many peo
ple say, "Why do you send young
<rirls into saloons to sell papers ?"
It is because they reach a class of
people that could never be reached
in any other way, and they sell pa
pers to people who would never
read any other.
In the Salvation Army it is not
talent that counts; but we say to
those who offer themselves: "If you
are sincere and if your heart be
longs to God, we will try you, we
will give you a chance." 1 know
of a young woman who had no
education at all, who came to us, a
poor, ignorant girl; today she is not
only gifted but can secure larger
audiences than many doctors of
divinity.
As we look out upon the world
it does not seem to us that it is
more churches that are needed but
more of the spirit of real sacrifice.
Mo/e of the spirit that makes
people rise up and overcome self.
We believe that there can he no
true religion without sacrifice; no
true religion without sacrifice for
others. There is too much getting
ready for Heaven and too little of
bringing Heaven down here into
our lives and the lives of others,
The Salvation Army is a move
ment which is growing today, which
has a great power and influence,
and which is doing a great work
which no other church can do.
In conclusion Mrs. Booth spoke
of the work of the Auxiliary League
which was organized in order that
others might not he shut out of the
Salvation Army work. Leagues
have been organized in almost all
of the colleges of the East and are
doing a great work for the Army
proper. The requirements for mem
bership are three:
Eirst, to speak a good word for
the Salvation Army and to tight its
battles.
Second, to pray for it.
Third, to contribute an annual
fee of five dollars.
