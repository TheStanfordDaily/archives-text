In addition to the recent edi
torial on the subject in tho Daily
Palo Ai,to there have been several
inquiries regarding the length of
the story and farce for the 97 An
nual.
After a careful examination of
all the college annuals available
I find that in no case does either a
-tory or farce exceed the limit set
in the j.resent instance; namely,
1,( 00 words.
These inquiries have been made
under the mistaken impression
that the limit of *the story set by
the two Annuals already published
by the University was 8,000 words.
The only question involved by
the objections to the present limit
is the possibility of a good story
being written within the prescribed
space. This is adequately an
swered by the two preceding An
nuals.
The limitation to 1,000 words of
both the story and the farce has
been made because we expect to
publish more than one. Were
they of greater length there would
not be room for them.
It should be remembered that
the farce is for publication in the
Annual only, and not for presenta
tion on Junior day. With the
latter event the Annual has no
connection.
