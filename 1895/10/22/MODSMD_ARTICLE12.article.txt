To give both sides a show in the
agitation for university credits on
newspaper work, we <|U<Â»le the fol
lowing l>y llossiter Johnson in the
September I nirerxity Macjazinc:
The prevalent agitation among
the undergraduates of our colleges
to obtain a collateral credit on the
mark hooks of their professors for
work and time expended on one of
the college publications, is being
carried to an excess out of all pro
portion to the importance /rff the
work. Why, the question arises,
should a student receive special
recognition for the performance of
voluntary and honorary duties? Yet
the faculties seem disposed to yield;
the University of Wisconsin has
decided to give credit for work done
in the university orchestra. Trav
esty of travesties! At last we are
permitted to discern the glimmer
ing dawn of the twentieth century,
when the hie player and drum
major of a college band will per
haps be credited with two hours or
more in pneumatics.
