# In the Mud
## 
### 
The gridiron was covered with
mud last night, real, sticky, shiny
mud, which formed sabots on the
players' feet, matted their hair like
a Digger Indian's, and gave them
the general appearance of mud
babies.
Walter Camp was out to give the
men their first lesson of the year.
Fora while he stood and watched
the punting. He then lined-lip the
first team and showed them some
new plays.
After a little preliminary signal
practice the men lined-up in this
order:
l'auly 1 end r Bartlett
Carle 1 tackle r Smith
Fickert 1 guard r James
Garton center Lewers
Harrington., r guard 1 Thomas

H. Reynolds.fullbacks.. .Overacker
The first team started out in good
shape, and after a short struggle
landed the ball over the goal line.
They had the advantage for some
time, but the scrubs finally took a
brace and squared things by not
only holding the others down but
also making an equal number of
touchdowns.
The beauty of it all was that
everybody played football ; there
was no lagging. The first team's
line was far heavier than the sec
ond team's, but the little fellows,
towards the end, went tearing
through it as though it were a sieve.
Even the spectators managed to
give an occasional yell. It will
take some time for the elevens to
get used to the yelling, so it would
he well if the onlookers took it slow
at first; the men hear a yell so sel
dom that it is apt to "rattle" them,
if "sprung" too suddenly.
Overacker made two or three
good punts and made some good
runs. Reynolds work, of the same
kind, was very good.
Each one of the halfbacks did
some first-class work. Leavitt made
a gain of ten yards, in which he
squirmed away from several men
and was at last stopped by Spald
ing. Bartlett, on the end, also
made some good tackles, and Mc
intosh played quarter like a little
major.
Harrington put up a very hard
game—working like a Trojan, while
Thomas did well in holding him
down. The latter got over the
ground as fast as the ends.
The piny was much faster than
heretofore —the second team work
ing even faster than the first.
