						Benefit Concert.

Lovers of music should not miss
the opportunity next Friday even
ing of listening to one of the best
selected programs yet presented in
the chapel. The performers are
Misslna Griffin, pianist; Herr Louis
Heine, celloist, and Mrs. 11. li. La
throp, vocalist.
Miss Griffin enjoys the distinc
tion of being classed among the
leading musicians of the Coast.
She is already known to the faculty
circle, having been a visitor on the
campus several times; those who
were fortunate enough to hear her
perform 011 those occasions will lie
glad of the chance to hear her in
public. The Oakland Enquirer
says of her :
"She emphatically makes the
part of herself; subtle
shade of thought and feeling ex
pressed by an exquisite touch, with
coloring warm and alive, and a
tone that can only be brought out
from a lingering, fond touch, re
minding one of the human quality
of tone in a violin. The inter
mezzo, or cradle song, by Raff,
seemed to sing itself from the piano.
The last number, the Tarantelle of
Chopin, showed the absolute power
and brilliancy of her touch, and
was a happy conclusion of a varied
and most excellently selected pro
gram. Her tone is certainly clear
and pure, and her execution fault
less."
Herr Louis Heine has no super
ior in this country. A San Fran
cisco critic says: "Of Heine's artis
tic and scholarly work it is unneces
sary to speak, his high attainments
being already known to concert
goers. His technique is simply
splendid, his tone exquisite, and his
conception thoroughly truthful and
artistic."
Mrs. 11. B. Lathrop's appearance
before a University audience is al
ways hailed with pleasure. She will
sing twice on Friday evening.
The receipts are for the Hospital
Fund of the Students' Guild.
The sale opens at the postoffice
Wednesday at 1:80.
