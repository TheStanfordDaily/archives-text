Tomorrow we are to have a foot
ball game between the Stanford
team and that of the Reliance
Athletic Club, and a great deal of
benefit should accrue to our players
from the practice. It has been a
very noticeable fact on the football
Held lately that there has been a
great lack of cheering and applause
on the part of the side-lines. This
is surely a very bad sign. Now
that our coach has arrived and the
team is getting into first class con
dition, our football enthusiasm
should be stirred up to the very
highest, and it is to be hoped that
the voice of the bleachers and side
lines will not be found wanting in
the exciting and really important
contest tomorrow afternoon.
