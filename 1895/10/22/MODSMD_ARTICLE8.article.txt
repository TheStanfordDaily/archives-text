Many of the students have not
yet paid their student body assess
ment and, if the negligent ones have
any patriotism for their college or
the athletic interests which repre
sent it, they should do so at once.
The best way, and in fact the only
way that athletics can be carried
on at this University, until money
is forthcoming from the receipts of
regular football games, is through
the one dollar assessment which
each student is supposed to pay
into the treasury each year. If
much of this assessment remains
unpaid the interests of sport must
of necessity suffer. At the present
time it is this lack of money in the
treasury which prevents the mem
bers of the '96 football team from
securing the sweaters which they
recently won, and to which they
are justly entitled.
This is a matter which has been
written and talked about a great
deal, but conditions remain practi
cally the same. Ttis evidently more
a matter of carelessness or of failure
to be dunned, than of intention on
the part of students, that theirdues
still remain unpaid; but if these
students were possessed of the right
college spirit, they would see that
their dollars reached the student
body without waiting for the col
lectors to come around after them.
