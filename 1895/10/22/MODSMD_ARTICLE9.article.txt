Last year the custom was in
augurated by the present Junior
Class of giving an annual sopho
more cotillion. As the scheme was
not fully developed until late in the
first, or early in the second semester,
the first annual dance was not held

until the latter part of February.
The occasion was well attended and
welT managed and in fact a success
in every way.
Still there are a number of rea
sons why in succeeding years the
cotillion should not be held the
second semester. First, this semester
is generally pretty well taken up
with social functions of various
kinds,such as private dances,charity
balls,the.Junior and Senior hops,etc.,
which occur at different intervals
throughout the term and sometimes
within close proximity to each other.
At certain periods of the year, on
the other hand, there is nothing
whatever taking place in a social
way. Particularly is this noticeable
in the first semester, the Sopho
more-Freshman reception being
about the only event which occurs
to break the long monotony. Why
should not the cotillion be given
then and thus distribute the social
events more evenly between the
two semesters ? If the members of
the present Sophomore class are in
favor of such a change, as they un
doubtedly must be, they should be
gin talking over the matter at once
and not delay so long that its con
summation will have to be post
poned until next year.
