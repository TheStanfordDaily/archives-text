# STANFORD 8, RELIANCE O.
## Won by Reliance's Poor Defensive Work Rather Than Stanford's Good Playing. 
### 
The beautiful weather has served
to bring <>ut a good crowd. At
2:80 the bleachers are tilled and
the field is surrounded by carriages
ii I led with speet a tors.
The Reliance team objects to
playing too soon after a hearty
meal and for that reason the
game is postponed from 2:80 until
2: 45. While waiting for the teams
to line up the crowd whistles and
sings popular tunes in chorus.
Stanford comes out at 2:15 and
practices signals and new plays.
The held is in excellent condition
and the weather just such as to
warm the players to hard work.
Mr. Camp says lie is afraid Stan
ford will be beaten because Re
liance is stronger than the <Mympics
and if Stanford cannot gain more
ground than they did last Satur
day they will lose.
Reliance comes on the field
thirteen minutes before three. They
are greeted by the Reliance yell,
followed by the Stanford yell. Re
liance practices punting for several
minutes. They appear very pro
ficient in this.
At live minutes before three the
teams line up. Captain Cochran
wins the toss and chooses the kick.
Reliance take the east goal. The
teams line up in the following
order:
ST A NKORI). If KM A NCK.

Referee, Oliver. Umpire, Mcin
tosh.
Reynolds kicks off for about
twenty-five yards. Reliance gets
the ball, but makes very little gain.
They buck for two yards and again
for one. Huff punts fora good
distance. Cotton downs the ball.
Weldon punts the ball back. Huff
catches the ball, but is cleverly
tackled without a gain by Spald
ing. Reliance here gains a few
yards by bucking. The play is
pretty snappy at this point. Stan
ford is holding Reliance down in
good shape. McMillan takes the
ball, but Cotton tears around from
behind and tackles him before he
has made much headway. Coch
ran breaks through and stops the
play. Third down, two yards to
gain. Reliance gains a few yards
by bucking. Cotton breaks through
and tackles, causing Reliance to
lose three yards. After an ineffec
tual attempt to gain the distance,
Huff punts. Harry Reynolds
catches the ball and with very
little interference makes a splendid
run and carries the ball behind the
goal line. The spectators send up
a mighty shout and the Stanford
yell is heard again and again, but
the ball is brought back to the ten
yard line because Frankenheimer
used bis hands in interference.
The Stanford men arc more de

termined than ever to make a touch
down and, through their hard work
and Reliance's poor defense, force
the ball to the five-yard line. Frank
enheimer is given the ball and is
downed within a yard of the goal.
The ball is knocked out of his
hands and rolls across the line.
Cochran is there to receive it and
touches the air-bag down. There is
no try at goal, because it is a prac
tice game. Score : Stanford 4, Re
j liance 0.
Reliance kicks off, and Weldon
returns with a punt. The ball is
forced back and forth near the cen
ter of the field and, at the call of
time, rests in Reliance territory
about seventeen yards from the
center of the field.
Everyone is surprised at the poor
showing made by Reliance. It was
generally expected that they would
put up a much better game than
Olympics. Of course our team has
improved a little since last week,
but it is very weak yet. The play is
still very slow, although at a few
| points in the beginning of the game
the piay was snappy.
Time called for the second half
at 8:20. Williams and Weldon are
substituted by Stanford.
Reliance kicks off for forty yards.
| Stanford returns the kick. The ball
is punted well into Reliance terri
j tory.
Reliance then manages to work
the ball back to the center of the
field by bucking and end running
tactics. They attempt to
Fickert blocks the ball. Stanford
takes a hand and works the ball
slowly back. On the third down
Weldon punts, llanlon attempts
to catch the ball, but Spalding
and Cotton are close upon him.
The ball strikes him and bounds
against Cotton and then across the
goal 1 ino, where Spalding touches
it down. Thus both of our touch
downs are virtually made on flukes.
Score: Stanford <S, Reliance 0.
Reliance kicks off for thirty
yards. Weldon returns. Ball in
touch-. Reliance ball. Cochran
here does a clever piece of tackling.
The Reliance kick is stopped.
Stanford kicks to the center of the
field.
Here Reliance begins to make
holes in our line. McMillan goes
I through the left side of our line,
1 time after time, and by a series of
j plays the ball is carried to the
; Stanford lifteen-yard line. McMil
lan takes the pig-skin again and
'carries it eight yards before he is
stopped. In the next few plays the
I ball is forced to within a few yards
iof the Stanford goal. The Stanford
I sympathizers hold their breath.
I Frick is given the ball; Spalding
misses him, but Cotton nails him
with a loss of two yards. Reliance
then gains three yards, but time is

I yards from the goal line.
