It is a source of great annoyance
to many of us that so many un
founded reports about Stanford Uni
versity have been printed during
the past two years. Almost all ac
counts which reach the East are to
the effect that Stanford's professors
are deserting her and that her doors
must soon close. Of course all this
has its influence and we must de
precate the all too frequent appear
ance of such stuff in the past.
An opportune time to put a stop
to these vexatious rumors and to

send out in their stead real inform
ation is drawing near, if the suit
now pending is decided in our favor
we shall have a splendid opportun
ity of drawing the attention of the
world to Stanford and her future
possibilities. The newspapers have
injured us heretofore. Why not
turn them to our benefit hereafter?
This is an age when advertising
works wonders for men. Why
should not a university invoke the
aid of the same powerful agency ?
We suggest that a number of
articles describing Stanford and its
surroundings be written and held
in readiness to print in the papers
till over the country as soon as the
present difficulty is settled. A
large number of descriptive articles
could be placed with Eastern pub
lishers. Many of them would pay
liberally for such articles if they
were well written. A few well
chosen sketches for illustration
would add greatly to their value to
the University and also help to se
cure their publication. A two col
umn description sold to a news
paper syndicate to be done in plate
would be of untold advantage.
We know of at least one univer
sity in this country where a metro
politan journal is assigned to each
member of the Press Club and thus
each of these journals is kept sup
plied with accounts of that univer
sity's improvements and achieve
ments. Can we not do the same?
Let our Press Club take up the mat
ter and consider the feasibility of
this plan.
