# The
						Stanford Suit.
## 
### 
Leaving aside all considerations
of whether the late decisions in the
(iovernment suit against the Stan
ford estate are just or not, we con
gratulate our sister university on
her success. We think we are
stating the truth when we say that
next to Stanfoid I'niversity, no
one would he more pained to wit
ness the closing of her doors, from
any cause whatsoever, than the
students and officers of the I'ni
versity of ( l aiifornia. The rivalry,
generous or otherwise, existing be
tween these two institutions works
tor their common advancement.
We of the l'. ('. would feel that in
losing Stanford we had suffered a
personal loss, a part of ourself, so
to speak, so closely have the two
become united in the student mind,
lint leaving asidethis selfish aspect
of the case, we can safely say that,
on the broader ground of common
fellowship, we are happy to learn
that the outlook in the present
suit is exceedingly bright for the
('ardimil. We, too, salute "the
old Hag." Herkcl i"i/an.
