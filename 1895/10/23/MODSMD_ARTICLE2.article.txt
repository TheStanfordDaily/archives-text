# Yesterday's Football Practice.
## 
### 
The field hist, night was very
hard. The men in the hist week
have had practice on every kind of
lield from the softest to the hardest.
There was a good sized crowd of
spectators on the side lines and
there was considerable enthusiasm
displayed, hut it was all the work
of a handful of '95 men, led by
Sheehan and Field. If the other

classes would only become imbued
with some of '95's college spirit we
could give Berkeley a lesson in how
to make noise.
It would be well to insert an ad
vertisement in some paper, reading
thus: "Wanted—a fullback." We
need one and need one badly. Our
present candidates for that position
are good football players. They
back the line and tackle well but
their punting is not up to the
mark.
Some of the men played fair
football, but as a whole the play
was not good. It was too slow and
too loose and there was very little
interference. The second team was
much stronger, in many points,
than the Varsity.
The Scrub center, composed of
Thomas, hewers, and Williams,
outplayed the opposing heavy
weights.
The best tackling was done by
Weldon, Frankenheimer, Mel ntosh,
and Cochran.
Jeffs was out as a candidate for
end and was in every play. He
could give many of the older men
lessons on following the ball.
Rice and Carle worked very
hard and made a very good show
ing.
The best runs were made by
Cochran, B. Thomas, and Over
acker.
There was far too much off-side
play. This should be stopped at
once. We have lost too many
hard earned yards in the past to
allow such work to continue.
