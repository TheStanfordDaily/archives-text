# The 						Far North.

])r. I. O. Stringer spoke last even
ing in the chapel on "The far
North." The lecture was illustrated
with stereopticon views, and al
though entirely impromptu, con
tained many points of interest. He
spoke in part as follows :
It is some time since ] had the
experience of appearing before an
audience of this kind, and the life
up where 1 have been does not help
one in speaking, nor in the use of
the English language. Hut, how
ever, 1 will just ask you to hear
with me while 1 tell you some
thing of the work in the country
where i have been the last few
years.
I will just begin and go over hur
riedly a few points about this far
away country. The inhabitants of
the country round about the Mac
kenzie river are Indians and Es
kimos. Some years ago these Es
kimos were very treacherous crea
tures, but now they are capable of
management. They have several
customs peculiar to themselves, one
of which is piercing the lips to at
tach small, round buttons of ivory.
The seasons 1 can hardly de
scribe. The winter is very long, the
summer very warm. The sun dis
appears at Hershell Island for
forty-eight days ; the moon, in the
winter, follows the example of the
sun and circles the horizon once
each day. (irass grows very closely,
but no farming can be carried on.
'J 1 he mode of travel is for the
summer by canoe, and in the win
ter by dog-sled; we travel along
having four dogs attached to a bob
sled. At night we shovel the snow
off the ground, make a fire and lie
down beside the tire, where we sleep

very comfortably. In tlie summer
tlie modes of travel are combined;
the canoe is carried on the sled un
til water is reached, when the pro
cess is reversed. The houses are
made of snow, and it is astonish
ing how comfortable these snow
houses can he made.
In the summer women have to row
the boats, while the men go ahead
to sqt the traps. You see them
dressed very much like the men,
and in this respect they are much
more advanced than the "new
woman," which 1 hear so much
about. Hie people are very in
genious in many ways, especially
in making their sleds and canoes.
Frozen meat or lisli is eaten by
the Eskimo and tastes very well. 1
believe that frost has much the
same effect on meat that lire has.
There are many lisli in rivers, so
that food at times is very abundant,
while at other times it is very scarce.
The living of the country is some
times very precarious, especially
when flour gets to be forty cents a
pound.
The chief characteristics of this
country are not so much concerned
with what we see present as with
what is absent. No carriages, no
street-cars, no police, no govern
ment, no taxes, papers perhaps
twice a year â€”with these things ab
sent one is apt to grow lazy ami
listless unless he tries to improve
himself by study.
The language is very peculiar ;
whole sentences may be expressed
in one word. They have a different
form of the word for each voice,
mood, tense, number, and person.
Hut still the Gospel triumphs,and
"Hearts that with heavenly fervor
glow
Are found amid the Arctic snow."
