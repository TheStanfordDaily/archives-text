The happy policy adopted by the
officers of this University of
inviting prominent lecturers to ad
dress the students has been favor
ably commented upon and fre
quently complimented by many
other colleges. Stanford students
are given the opportunity of hear
ing the views of the best thinkers
and workers in special lines at the
expense of merely an hour's time
out of the week. Those who do not
improve such advantages are mak
ing a sad mistake — one which,
though unfelt now, will be percept
ible to them later when the college
course is completed.
It is a good plan to take one's
own notes on such lectures, for that
impresses the speaker's ideas on
the hearer's mind in an inefface
able manner. But whether one
takes notes or not the thoughts of
the lecture most worthy of a place
in the memory will involuntarily
imprint themselves there to be
called into use when necessity
arises.
Many students imagine they can
learn nothing from the speaker or
believe that their time might better
be employed on the text-book les
sons. Such a belief is generally
foolish in the extreme. It is such a
speaker as seldom appears at Stan
ford who does not say something
worth hearing or who does not leave
something with his listeners well
worth cherishing.
