Ihe murk eel enthusiasm shown
at yesterday's game was in severe
contrast with the apparent indiffer
ence heretofore prevailing at these
games. Jl is to he hoped that this
commendable spirit will not die out
as suddenly ;is it appeared. Every
practice game should meet with
just as much manifested approba

\\ by should not Stanford establish
an official cheering staff as exists
in so many Eastern colleges? At
each game with Berkeley the need
of such a committee becomes more
apparent. The idea of having a
regular standing staff, not only to
lead in the cheering, but to get the
students trained for their duty on
Thanksgiving day, should be im
mediately put into effect.
