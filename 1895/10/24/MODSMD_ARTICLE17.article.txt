Berkeley is experiencing the
same difficulty in collecting the
student assessment that is troub
ling Stanford. There ns here the
real fault seems to lie in the im
pelled system of collecting. There
are probably few students in either
university who desire to avoid the
payment of assessment, but so long
as no collector makes it his busi
ness to see that individual students

pay uj>, so long will many escape
i their just share of the burden.
Our sister institution is now try-
I ing a plan that might be used to
; advantage here. small com
mittee was lirst appointed, each
■ member of which is to collect from
| ten students. Each of these groups
jof ten in turn collects from ten
I others, until every member of the
university is reached. If this
method proves practicable in Berk
eley, it should be tried here.
