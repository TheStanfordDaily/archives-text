The advent of so great and good
a woman as Mrs. Ballirigton Booth
| marks an epoch in our intellectual
j life. First, it is valuable for us to
! have some cobweb prejudices con
cerning women as speakers removed.
Wecond, it is a great chance for ex
, tending our horizon by learning
j that the ,Salvation Army is not a
collection of uneducated, emotional
freaks who can bring no lesson to
us, but that it contains pure, broad,
and self-sacrilicing men and women
who dare anything which promotes
i the betterment of the human family.
| The very flexibility of their require
! inents makes it possible to include
: every one who has a spark of virtue,
of aspiration,of unselfishness. What
other religious organization num
bers in its ranks not only the rich
and poor, cultured and illiterate,
| but also the skeptics, doubters, un
believers in the crystallized forms of
religion, but lovers of humanity
; and philanthropy ?
It is good for us who, in pursu
ing self-culture, are prone to degen
erate into self-iovers, to practice
some sacrifice and denial. It is
; wonderful how many vanities we
.see in ourselves in the clear mirror
i of truth bold up by a sweet, strong,
and sincere woman like Mrs.
Booth.
