## 
### 
Mrs. Ballington Booth was the!
daughter of Rev. Win. Charles
worth, a clergyman of the Church
of England. As a child she used j
to sit and listen to her father's
reading, and hear the "thump,
I hump" of the Salvation Army
drumming past the church. Her
first feeling was that it was only a
vulgar mob, hut later she realized
that the Army reached and drew
in people who would not come to
her father's church. Little hy
little her interest in the work in
creased until she joined the Army
and was sent, at the age of seven
teen, as a missionary to France.
Opposition to the Salvationists was
extremely violent at this time and
she was repeatedly arrested for
carrying on the work. She did
not give up, however, hut contin
ued her endeavors in France until
her transfer to Switzerland some
years later. Ilere she was expelled
by order of the government, and
next went to Sweden.
She found so much debauchery!
and vice among the students in the
University at I'psala, Sweden, that
she held a great meeting for the
students alone and obtained an
audience of over 1600. Her suc
cess was phenomenal and many of
the open practices were done away
with.
She then went back to London
and engaged in rescue work in the
slums. Nine years ago she was
married to Ballington Booth, and
both came to America to take
charge of the work in this country.
The purpose of her visit to the j
Coast is to inspect the Army work j
