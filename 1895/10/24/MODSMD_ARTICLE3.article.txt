The path of Josh, the comic 1 Â»i
-weekly of the University of Califor
nia, is not exactly strewn with rones.
The following concerning its pre
carious position appeared in the
Berkeley correspondence of this
morning's Call :
The publication of Josh, the comic
bi-weekly :it the university, has
ii ''n temporarilv suspended pend

ing a consultation of the chairman
of the board of editors and the art
editor with the committee on stu
dents' affairs. The staff had a meet
ing yesterday to consider whether
it would he advisable to continue
the issuance of tlie paper on ac
count of lack of the expected sup
port and the difficulty in securing
contributions.
The committee on students' af
fairs, consistingof Professors Bacon,
Edwards, and Soule, had sum
moned Chairman Jackson and Edi
tor Steele to appear hero re it on
Thursday afternoon fora consulta
tion, the topic of which was not
made known. This announcement
put a check to the progress of the
next issue, since it was thought
that possibly the committee desired
to order all operations permanently
suspended, from the fact that.some
very hard hits on the military de
partment appeared in the last num
ber.
The committee declared, at their
conference with the staff before the
appearance of the first issue, that if
anything that appeared to them ob
jectionable was published, they
would stop the Josh without debate.
It leaked out today that the hit
at the military department was the
bone of contention which was to be
picked between the committee and
the editors.
