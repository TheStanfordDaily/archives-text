The new station at Palo Alto
promises to be neat and attractive.
If flowers are planted around it, it
may some day vie with the San
Carlos or Burlingame station, not
in expensiveness, but in general
picturesqueness. To those of us
who have for years been accustomed
to the little old frame building
about to be supplanted, Palo Alto
will not be the same when it is de
stroyed. Still odder will the new
station seem to pioneers who were
here when Palo Alto was not, when
May field or Menlo Park was the
nearest stopping place.
