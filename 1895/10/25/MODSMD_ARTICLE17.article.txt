The call issued yesterday fora
meeting of the Hand next Wednes
day evening should meet with n
hearty response, both from old
members and new students who
play Band instruments. Last year
this organization was one of the

most successful of all our student
enterprises. To be a member of
the Band was a coveted honor.
About Thanksgiving time tlie Band
boys were college heroes. If the
football men were "first in war,
first in peace, first in the hearts of
their countrymen," the men who
followed the drum major were not
bad seconds. The Band formed a
nucleus of an enthusiastic meeting
of Stanford men in the morning
before the game. Its appearance
at the football grounds was a potent
factor in our enthusiasm, and
finally when time was called it was
the Band that headed our tri
umphal procession back to head
quarters.
Berkeley has a band this year
which plays occasionally at the
afternoon practice and in other
ways manifests its interest in the
result of the Thanksgiving game.
But our chances for needing a
band to help celebrate are about as
good as Berkeley's. Moreover, it is
probable that a Stanford Band
would not suffer in a comparison
with that of U. C. About thirty
men have indicated their willing
ness to join. There should be
about ten more added t<> this num
ber; then the Band may become a
worthy successor of last year's or
ganization.
