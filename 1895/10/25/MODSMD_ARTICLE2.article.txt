# In the Scrimmage
## 
### 
The bleachers were well filled
last night with enthusiastic spec
tators who showed that there is still
plenty of yell left in Stanford, if
some one will take the lead. The
college yell was given repeatedly
and served to encourage the men.
Several of the Varsity men were
not out and two or three of those
who were on hand were tried in new
positions. Weldon was tried at
quarter, but as he is inexperienced
in that position it is diflicult to
judge just what he will do. He
lias the advantage of weight in his
favor and with proper training
should do well.
Cochran and Carle played the
halves. They both made splendid
gains. Carle, though slow, bucked
the line in McMillan style and in
the tirst part of the practice made
a touch-down from the center of
the field. Cochran did some of the
best work done this season. He
alternated with Harry Reynolds at
full and did some strong punting.
There was altogether too much
fumbling on both sides. The men
would go into a scrimmage and
apparently lose all idea of where
tlie ball was until some man on
the outside of the heap would pick
it up and tear down the field with
perhaps one man after him.
The second eleven was composed
of freshmen, with the exception of
three men. It would naturally be
expected that the first team would
have a walk-over, but they did not.
They were held down very well, in
fact so well that things looked
rather gloomy fora while.
Of the heavy men, Harrington
and Williams made the best show
ing. Fickert played a good steady
game. Ren Thomas did the ground
gaining tor the Scrubs. Although
rather this man is a swift
runner and manages generally to
find a hole.
Ilolbrook, Ray Smith, and Jeffs
made some clever tackles. Unlike
the majority of the men, they tackle
low. We see far too much of the
so-called "necktie" tackle. The
players seem to forget the three
"low" rules of football: To run
low with the ball, to tackle low,and
to get down low in the line. The

men stand up straight in front of a
moving mass and try to stop it, in
stead of falling in front of the lead
ing man.
