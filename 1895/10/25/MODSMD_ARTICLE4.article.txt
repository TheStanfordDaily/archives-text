# Lectures to Engineers.
## 
### 
The two lectures delivered in (lie
chapel by Mr..John Kit hards, M. K.,
to the engineering students have
proven most satisfactory. Mr. Rich
ards is at present editor of Industry
and a consulting engineer, and a
man whose varied experience has
been gained in the practical super
vision of modeling and designing
in shops in America and in Eng
land. Mr. ltichards was invited by
the professors of the engineering de
partment to deliver a course of ten
weekly lectures, two of which have
already been given. The lirst lec
ture was merely preliminary to the
course. In the second he described
his position regarding the manage
ment of shops. Mr. Richards is a
strong advocate of Ihe contract sys
tem. where the whole body of men
are responsible for the work done,
as against the wage and piece' sys
tems.
The four outlays of the shop—
material, labor, expense, and profit
—were taken up and discussed
separately. The first three are
necessary to the working of every
shop; while last —profit —is the mo
tive of the shop's existence.
The third lecture of the course
will be given next Thursday at
11 :H() a.m. in Ihe chapel.
