Another of t lie Lei ami Stanford
Junior I'niversity publications has
1 >een issued. It is entitled "The
Neocene of the Santa Cruz .Moun
tains ; I —Stratigraphy," aml is the j
dissertation presented by George
Hall Ashley in '94 for his doctor's
degree. In its present form it is a
reprint from the proceedings of the
California Academy of Sciences,
series 2, vol. v.
It is a pamphlet of ninety-five
pages and four plates. The latter
are all from drawings made by the
author and are as follows: liaised
beach near Lohetus—Quarternary
strata; sketch map of the area of
the Santa Cruz mountains; sections
of several Coast regions; and Mussel
Hock from the south, showing
marine Pleistocene, overlying sand
dunes and igneous rocks.
After a short introduction the
.author devotes several pages to the
topography and physical geography
of the region treated. The follow
ing paragraph touching upon the
altitude of well-known landmarks
may be of interest:
"Santa Cruz Mountains. —This
name has been given to the series
of parallel ridges extending from
the Bay of Monterey northwest to
Point San Pedro. The ridges have
a strike of nearly northwest and
southeast. Thev reach their high
. —
est point in Mount Bache, 8780 feet
above sea-level; further to the north
Black Mountain readies a height
of nearly 3000 feet. Further to the
northwest, and south of Pilarcitos
Lake and Creek, the Cumbre de las
Auros rises in high bare ridges
2000 to 3000 feet high, and again
near Point San Pedro this same
ridge attains a height of 1940 feet
in Mount Montara."
Five pages are devoted to an ac
count of the work of other geologists
in this region, ten more to the gen
eral geology, and then follows the
main part of the pamphlet on the
stratigraphy in detail.
The salient points of the paper
are:
1. The description of the con
glomerate and sandstone formation
underlying the Monterey series.
2. The description of transition
beds between the Monterey and
Merced series.
3. Fixing the ages of the Merced
and post-Merced uplifts in south
ern and northern California.
4. Outlining the Quaternary his-
I tory of the region about San Fran
j cisco Bay.
