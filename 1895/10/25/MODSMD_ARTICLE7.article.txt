David Luhin has made another!
I generous offer, as will he seen'
from the following letter by Prof, j
1 Ely of the University of Wisconsin: j
| "It gives me pleasure to announce j
that D. Lubin, Esq., of Sacramento, I
â–  Cat., has placed at my disposal the
'sum of to be awarded in
prizes for essays on the subject of
" The Agricultural Depression and
! its Remedies." After careful con
sideration I have decided to throw
open the competition to a 11 students
in the slate universities of Michi
gan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, 1

offering three prizes, viz., a first
prize of $125, a second prize of $7"),
and a third prize of $50.
"It is desired that the facts con
cerning the agricultural depression
should he carefully and critically
examined and presented, that the
causes of the depression should he
discussed, and the remedies for the
depression should receive attention.
Among the various plans which
have been advanced for improving
the agricultural condition it is ex
pected that competitors will con
sider Mr. Luhin's proposal that
bounties he paid on the exportation
of staple agricultural products. Jt
is also suggested that the relation
of transportation to agriculture
should receive consideration. In the
libraries of each one of the insti
tutions will be found pamphlets
setting forth Mr. Luhin's proposal
and his arguments. Jt should be
clearly understood that an advo
cacy of these plans is not required,
but that it is simply expected that
they should be freely discussed and
the conclusions reached stated,
whether they be favorable or un
favorable.
"The following gentlemen have
consented to act as judges, namely,
Professor William A. Scott of the
University of Wisconsin, Prof.
W. W. Folwell of the University of
Minnesota, and I)r. Charles H.
Cooley of the University of Michi
gan." Richard T. Ely.
