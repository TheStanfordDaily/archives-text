The long looked for Woman's
Literary Club lias at last made its
appearance on the scene. Ever
since the reorganization of the
Alpha Society two years ago we
have been asking why our women
neglect so important a field of in
tellectual activity as debating. In
dividuals there have been who
were interested in forensic matters,
but there has been no attempt to
form an organization. One or two
of the societies have, it is true, left
their conditions of membership so
loosely drawn that female members
might be admitted, but no woman
seemed disposed to ask admission.
On behalf, therefore, of the de
bating interests of the University,
a cordial greeting is extended to
the new society, in the hope that
their foundation will be permanent
and that many will follow in the
way of their sister who once so ably
defended the debating interests of
Stanford.
