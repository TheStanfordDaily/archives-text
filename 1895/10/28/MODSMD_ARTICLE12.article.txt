The broad spirit of tolerance
prevalent at this University has
often received favorable comment.
In few other institutions in the
world are people of varying con
victions received with such an
equal appreciation. Whether it be
a Catholic priest, a socialistic
leader, a Salvation Army captain,
a Unitarian clergymanâ€”whosoever
has a message of any kind to give
us receives our attention and ap
preciation.
Jn so much this spirit is good,
but are we not in danger of touch
ing the other extreme? Is it not
likely that in striving for the uni
versal we may neglect the individ
ual belief? A belief of some kind
in something is necessary to the
highest development of character,
and any belief, no matter how
crude, is better than the attitude of
mind which does not know what it
believes. Toleration is good, but
we cannot afford to let it under
mine personal convictions.
This is not a plea for narrowness
in any respect. Our breadth of
view is perhaps the greatest thing

in this atmosphere of a wholly new
and wholly conservative University.
This is only a warning of one of
the dangers that threaten all those
who leave the beaten tracks.
