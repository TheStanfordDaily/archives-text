The serious lire which occurred
last night at the University of
Virginia will he a great blow to the
cause of higher education in the
South. Next to Johns Hopkins
Southern people have lately been
looking to this university for
leadership in culture. A compara
tively old institution, it had gath
ered about it those advantages in
spirit and tradition which can
come only with age. This calamity
has come at a peculiarly unfortu
nate time. How great has been
the loss in the art department and
library has not yet been ascertained,
but it is to be hoped that their old
documents in Southern history
escaped destruction. The spirit in
which the faculty have kept up
university work without a break of
even one day, is worthy of all com
mendation.
This calamity serves forcibly to
point out to us the wisdom of erect
ing our quadrangle on the one
story plan and entirely lire-proof.
With its massive and incombus
tible structure there is no reason
why the quadrangle should not
last as long as the Oxford univer
sity buildings.
