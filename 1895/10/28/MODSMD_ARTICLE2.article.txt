# Berkeley Defeats Reliance.
## 
### 
A very interesting game of foot
ball took place Saturday when Re
liance lined-up against the Berke
ley team. The final score, 8-0 in
favor of U. C., is specially worthy
of note by students here, that being
the same score made by Stanford
over the Reliance. The game put
up by the latter team was far su
perior to its display made on Stan
lord's gridiron.
Reliance kicked off 40 yards,and
Hupp brought the ball back 10
yards before tackled by Racine.
Berkeley played a cyclone game,

one play following another in rapid
succession. Hupp made a star end
run of 30 yards. Several good
gains were made by bucks of Berke
ley's ball's. Ransome got the ball
tina fumble and made another long
run from the center of the field to
the goal line, making a touchdown
in less than four minutes from the
call of time. Ransome failed in
his try-for-goal.
Up to this period the Reliance
men had shown up very weak,
while Berkeley's play was strong.
Her interference was good and her
playing seemed sure and accurate.
Huff kicked off for Reliance,
making a 45-yard score, but Ran
some was on hand and sent it back
85 yards. McMillan caught the
punt, but made no gain before Sher
man and Kennedy downed him.
Reliance did a little playing here
for the first time. McMillan broke
through U. C.'s right tackle for 7
yards. Frick made a slight gain
around left end, and Huff struck
the center fora yard. McMillan
made a good gain against the
Berkeley line. Reliance proved
strong at bucking, and adopted that
play almost exclusively. Oliver
played well in interference, and
some of McMillan's best gains were
the result of his interference.
Berkeley got the ball on a fumble,
and Ransome punted 80 yards.
McMillan was again under the ball,
and made but three yards, when
Hup}> brought him down. Nearly
all the plays for five minutes there
after were made entirely by Mc-
Millan. His longest gain was 6
yards. Not once did he fail to
make some perceptible gain. In a
hot scrimmage the ball was called
down, but being fumbled, was
picked up and carried across the
line by Kennedy. McMillan pro
tested and decided to continue the
game under protest. Ransome failed
to kick tin' goal. Score, 8-0; time
of play, twelve minutes.
Oliver kicked off for 85 yards,
but Ransome returned with a 45
yard punt. Frick caught tlu* ball
and brought it back 10 yards.
McMillan on two plays gained 15
yards. On a third attempt he was
tackled two yards behind the line
by Sherman.
Berkeley captured the ball on
downs and Ransome made another
long punt. Huff recovered ali but
10 yards on a like play and man
aged to keep the ball. Two mass
plays gave the Reliance team 10
; yards when the half ended.
At the beginning of the second
I half, things looked blue for the
| Oakland players. Ransome made
| a long kick-off and Huff was
I downed before he could advance
j the ball three yards. He was in
jured in the play and Walton took
i his place. Walton at first made
| no gains, but in the following plays
j he did some remarkable ground
| gaining, considering the efficiency
I of Berkeley's ends. Frick and
i McMillan hit the line forcontinued
| gains and Berkeley's eleven weak
ened perceptibly in the play. Re
liance depended entirely on the
mass plays, tin- backs doing good
I work. The ball was carried down
the field close I<> Berkeley's line but
all hope of a touchdown was lost
by another unfortunate fumble,
and Ransome punted the ball out

of danger. Reliance continued its!
bucking and slowly forced the ball
again into Berkeley's field, but time '
was called at this stage of the pro- j
ceedings. Capt. McMillan claimed
that by the agreement five minutes j
more time remained for play and j
he filed a second protest.
The teams lined-up as follows:
BERKELEY. RELIANCE. !
Sherman left end Racine j
Simpson. . . left tackle. . ..McHugh
Walthall.... left guard ()liver (
Schmidt center Hector J
Plunkett. . . .right guard . . Burnett!
Douglass. . . . right tackle . . .Taylor
Wilson right end.. .Sherrard
Kennedy. . quarterback ..Wvckoff
Dozier right half Frick
Hupp left half. . .McMillan
Ransome fullback Huff
The features of the game were
Ransome's punting and Sherman's
fine tackling. Plunkett played a
good game at guard. McMillan,
Walton, and Oliver did the best
work for Reliance.
Camp among other things said
of the game, "Ransome punted
well, and the work of Berkeley's
ends was admirable. Besides the
good work of Captain Sherman and
Wilson, one of the big line men
was occasionally down on a punt.
Fumbling was no worse than is
seen in the East at this season of
the year. The tackling of Sherman
and Hupp was first-class."
Butterwortli said, "Two touch
downs were made, but from neither
did Ransome kick a goal. Perhaps
touchdowns were unexpected, but
more likely it was that Berkeley
was unused to scoring, and could
not kick her goals from a too slight
acquaintance with the art."
