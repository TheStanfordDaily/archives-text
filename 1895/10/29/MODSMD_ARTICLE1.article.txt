# The
						Football Practice.

### 
The practice last night showed
considerable improvement in many
ways over that of a week ago. The
interference on the part of the Var
sity was better than usual â€”especi-
ally was this so in the runs result
ing from catches of kick-offs.
When one of the eleven caught the
hall, the other players fell in line
in good shape and gave him fair in
terference.
It is not in such plays as this,
though,that it is necessary to prac
tice so much. It is comparatively
easy to block off in a scattered
Held. The difficulty arises when
the men are lined up in close quar
ters. In a case of this kind our
men are deficient.
The play is entirely too slow.
Far too much time is taken up in
getting into line and giving the
signals.
Another grave fault is the way
the linemen stop, or rather do not
stop, the plays' directed against
their positions. Instead of getting
down low, they stand nearly up
right and try to stop their oppon
ents by pushing against them. It
is through the line that the Scrubs
made their gains. In last night's
practice, while Williams played
guard the halfbacks on his side
made good gains, simply because
lie opened holes for them.
If it had not been for several
costly fumbles, Reliance would
have played a much closer game
with Berkeley on Saturday. At
the most critical [joints, Reliance
lost all she had gained by fum
bling the ball. Our men should
take warning from this and dp
their best to overcome this inexcus
able fault.
Mr. Camp gave the tackles on the
Varsity a severe test by taking
away the support given them by
the halfbacks. The second team
then directed its plays against these
points and managed to force the
ball down the field. \\ illiams and
Carle were changed about and from
that on the first team "took a
brace." They gained possession of
the ball and managed to make a
touchdown.
Fickert, by a clean play, made a
touchdown. Code's interference was
very clever. Cochran made a
splendid run, and, in fact, played a
capital game.
The line-up was as follows:
