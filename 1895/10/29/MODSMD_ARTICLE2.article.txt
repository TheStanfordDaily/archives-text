The estimation of the musical
taste of the University that a spec
tator would make from the attend
ance at the musicalegiven lust Fri
day evening would he a discourag
ing one. Scarcely enough persons
were present to pa v the expenses of
the concert. However, the entertain
ment proved to he one of the most
enjoyable of its nature ever given

at Stanford. The audience listened
with rapt attention and expressed
its approval and admiration by
prolonged applause.
The program was sufficiently
catholic to appeal to all music
lovers. The composers represented
were of both the classic and ro
mantic schools, though the latter
predominated.
The concert was given by Miss
Ina Griffin, pianist, Mrs. 11. R.
Lathrop, soprano, and Mr. Louis
Heine, celloist.
The execution of Miss Griffin is
beautiful, and her touch is at once
sympathetic and firm. At all
times she played with ease and dis
tinctness, and though the octave
and chord-passages were frequently
taken with great rapidity, they
were always given with that incis
ive vitality of tone and distinct
ness of enunciation that only comes
from a perfect command of the
wrist.
Her phrasing was always well
considered; lacking neither breadth
nor elegance. In nearly every in
stance the tempi were judiciously
chosen. Her conceptions of the
different compositions, especially
of the Chopin nocturne and the de
lightful morceav played in response
to an encore, were mature and
poetic. The utterance of the canta
ltile passages was at all times essen
tially lyrical.
Miss Griffin evidently fully real
izes the value of the pedal for har
monic and tone coloring purposes.
The art of correctly using the pedal
is probably the most difficult prob
lem of higher piano playing. Much
of the marvelous success of Pader
ewski is undoubtedly due to his
masterly manipulation of the pedal
in securing his remarkable orches
tral variety of coloring.
There was nothing of servility in
her treatment of the music. Her
relation with the respective com
posers was a sympathetic one ; a
relation in which the composer was
the creative, vivifying mind, and
hers the receptive and interpretive
one.
Her interpretation of the Beet
hoven andante movement pos
sessed distinction and merit, and
the number by Joseffy was given
with a full appreciation of the
blithe-heartedness that is the in
forming spirit of the work. The
Preambule by Bach is a compo
sition in which his characteristic
continuous fugal manner seems to
have somewhat yielded to the es
sentially modern harmonic style.
It is an approach to the less austere
and more graceful spirit and style
of Haydn and Mozart. One of the
most vital characteristic traits of
Chopin is his unfailing refinement,
both of theme and harmony. The
nocturne in E major was given with
a full consideration of this quality.
The delicate and difficult Jioriture
were played with the requisite felici
tousness and facility.
Mrs. Lathrop sang the lovely and
florid aria, '"Lieti Signor," from
Meyerbeer's opera"Les Huguenots 1 '
in an admirable manner. The song
is one <>t those occasional exquisite
gems that we lind in Meyerbeer's
work, and that serve as an indica
tion of the chaste and beautiful
music be might have written had
he not vielded to his inclination

towards the theatrical and sensa
tional in operatic art. Warm and
agreeable in tone, Mrs. Lathrop's
voice possesses a peculiar downy
quality that lends it at once dis
tinction and charm. The intricate
fioriture with which the song
abounds were given with precision
and refinement. In the exquisite
lyric by Kjerulf she was even more
successful. The pathos of the com
position received adequate expres
sion, and the mezza-voce passages
were admirably given. Her grada
tions of tone and the phrasing were
always intelligent and artistic. She
was compelled to respond to an
encore.
The possession of a fine tech
nique, a broad, sympathetic tone,
and a certain sentiment of grace
and style stain]) Mr. Louis Heine
at once as an admirable performer.
His tone is rich, firm, and sympa
thetic; his phrasing artistic and
dignified ; and his intonation, even
in the most trying passages, is ab
solutely correct. 11 is technique is
finely developed ; his execution of
the most intricate passages being
always perfectly distinct. But,
what is much better and higher
than this, he showed a depth of
sentiment and a thorough apprecia
tion of the essential beauty of all
that he played.
