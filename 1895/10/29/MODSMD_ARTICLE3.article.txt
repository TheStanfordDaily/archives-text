# The
						Mission of Baptism
## 
### 
The last Sunday sermon was de
livered by Rev. E. B. Payne of
Alameda. He said in part:
Baptism is a word spoken by
John the Baptist concerning the
contrast between the work which
he came consciously to do with
that which he expected Jesus to
achieve. "1 indeed baptize you
with water, but He shall baptize
you with the Holy Ghost." This
baptism of water, as the world
recognizes it, is a symbol of repent
ance and forgiveness of sin. But
that which it symbolizes does
not, after all, amount to very
much; fora man pardoned for all
his sins may yet not amount to
very much â€”tnaybeonlya bleached
and common sort of soul. You
may wash a pebble and polish it
with the greatest care, but it will
never flash the light of a diamond.
There may be no positive moral
power resulting from baptism.
Jesus was himself a personal
moral power, and although many
of us may fail to see any practical,
tangible results, yet he did more
than to merely baptize with
water. Col. Ingersoll makes a
very strong complaint against
Jesus for not inculcating the value
of education, the sac redness of
the liotne, marriage, maternity,
the duties involved in international
and commercial relations; he says
that Jesus was extremely unpracti
cal, and therefore concludes that
bis teachings were unsuccessful.
But, following this line of reason
ing, why not condemn Christ just as
severely for saying nothing about
the present issues of silver, foreign
immigration, tariff, or-irrigation in
California? It is an interesting
fact that the only man in the New
Testament who ventured instruc
tion upon these "more practical"
questions lias thereby subjected
himself to severe criticism. Some
of Paul's statements have met with

violent opposition from our present
new women. The trouble probably
is that Col. Ingersoll is not ready
for the application of Christ's
teachings.
If then, Christ did not dwell
upon the modern issues of social
life, what did he do? Me endeav
ored to revive the dead spiritual
vitality of the people about him;
they could perform the ordinary
duties of life, but they showed a
lack of all true, actuating, redeem
ing spirit. But the people were
not ready for this; they longed for
some revolutionary change. 10veil
his disciples were always urging
him to do something real, tangible,
practical; to establish an earthly
empire which would release them
from Koine. These people believed
that some such a measure would
set them absolutely free, just as a
great many people today think
that our release from some certain
practical evils would set us free in
deed.
Christ knew that the result of
any such attempt would soon totter
and fall. His mission was to effect
a change of a more radical and
lasting kind ; lie put his ax to the
root of the tree ; lie baptized men
with the Holy (ihost.
I will not attempt an explana
tion of this term Holy Ghost; but
1 do disclaim all sympathy with
the idea that it is a kind of electri
fying agency which prepares men
for propagandisin and proselyting.
Not wishing to insist upon the ety
mology of the word, I believe that
''holy" refers to all that is perfect
and genuine in the human soul.
And this quality is as much needed
in modern as in ancient society.
We live under a regime of moral
and religious thought that thinks
it something awful to keep the Sab-
I bath day holy, whereas the law
j written on the heart of man com-
J mands us to keep every day holy.
And this evil is not to be re
i medied by what is commonly known
jas reform. True reform is not a
donning of a suit of clothes soon to
be discarded, or something into
which society is to jump and then
soon to he laid aside; it is, or ought
to be, the growth of the individual
human soul.
1 despair of seeing the world be
come much better, except in the
sense of individual development.
We cannot appreciably reform a
society made up as such of "Tom,
Dick, and Harry" ; they must first
become entitled to enough respect
to be called "Thomas, Kichard, and
! Henry," before any one can work
any great reform. It was this con
dition of individual life which Jesus
j had in view, and it is only through
| such holy baptism of the individual
that we today can hope to effect
1 great reforms.
