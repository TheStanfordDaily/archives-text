That there is a lack of enthusi
asm on the part of the spectators
on the football field is evident to
all, hut it does not seem that this
state of affairs can he ascribed en
tirely to the absence of college
patriotism. Situated as we are,
there is no reason why we should
not have as much or even more of
this feeling than falls to the lot of
most colleges. Here, where college
life all centers around the campus,
everything is conducive to the de
velopment of a patriotic spirit. We
have nothing to distract our atten
tion, no large cities within near
enough distance to absorb much of
our college life, and most of us live
and spend our time in intimate re
lations with each other. In this
respect we are much more fortunate
than the majority of colleges, and
this fact alone cannnot fail to
have, and most certainly does have,
its effect upon the minds and feel
ings of the students. It seems that

what we need is not ho much the
i creation of new, hut an awakening
j of the old enthusiasm that lies dor
j mant within us for want of proper
| incentive to bring it out. In the
! matter of football interest, it is
I '
l safe to say that if capable leaders
were appointed to conduct the
cheering on the gridiron each
night there would be no longer any
room for complaints upon the lack
of college patriotism and enthusi
asm.
