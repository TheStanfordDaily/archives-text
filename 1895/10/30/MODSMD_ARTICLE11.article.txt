Berkeley has already taken steps
towards securing organized yelling
at the Thanksgiving day game. The
matter has been placed in the hands
of a committee composed of the four
class presidents. These are to ar
range all details and select leaders
to direct the yelling at the game.
As in the past, it is probable that
Stanford's yelling will be without
system, and our spasmodic efforts
will he drowned by the continuous
and concerted yell rising from the
blue and gold sections. The only
way to prevent it is by a like organi
zation.
In this connection it may be well
to state that a leader of the Berke
ley freshmen will be appointed for
the game next Saturday, and a
squad organized to follow the play
up and down the side-lines, and
cheer the U. C. men on to their best
efforts.
