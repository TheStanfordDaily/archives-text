The good name which Stanford
is now enjoying among all classes,
irrespective of university connec
tions, is very gratifying to every one
whose interests are at all common
with those of his college. It is
brought home to us more strongly
every day that we are adding the
names of many new friends and ad
mirers to the list of our supporters,
whose friendship will one day he of
inestimable value to us.
The University is so young in
years that we can not have too keen
a realization of the effect the tra
ditions we establish now will have
upon it for an almost indefinite
period. No opportunity should he
lost to build up a reputation which
will always be an honor to the name
of Stanford. We must work for the
future in the days of our youth.
In the matter of individual con
duct, we can not be too careful. Not
only here, but especially away from
the University, students should
guard against anything which can
be considered at all ungentlemanly.
The relations of our athletic rep
resentatives to the outside world
have always been a credit to us. It
is highly desirable, almost abso
lutely necessary, that this state of
affairs shall continue. In college
sports, we must keep out all taint of
professionalism and maintain the
purity of our athletics.
