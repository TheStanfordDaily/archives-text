# Two University Presidents on Football.
## 
### 
President Thwing of Western lie-'
serve University, Cleveland, 0.,!
says of football:
It is not only a game of brains,
but it is a game that should be
played by gentlemen of trained
strength. If you have all gentle
men in the game, then there will be
no slugging. If you have players
who are strong and well trained,
then you will have few accidents.;
The students and professors know!
that the college is a training school,
not for football and baseball players,
but that it is for culture and to fit
the student for bis life work. |
Therefore all athletic sports com-'
mend themselves as a means to this
end."
President Andrews of Brown, in
his annual report says, of the clan
gers of football : ''For those in per
fect health and trained to it, foot
ball is safer than either rowing,
yachting, gunning, or running
hounds. Rowing appears to be
many times as fatal. So is base
ball. Even tennis is worse."
