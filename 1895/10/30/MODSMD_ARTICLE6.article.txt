Prof. A. T. Murray spoke last
evening on "Some phases of Greek
religious thought." Some of the
leading points of his lecture were
as follows:
Nations differ as individuals do in
the use they make of the elements
of their character; thus we learn
different lessons from different
peoples. When we study the
Greek thought we are studying the
body of thought of one of the most
serious and gifted of nations, and
one which gives us some of the
most valuable lessons of the past.
The name of religion is given to
this body of thought, with hesita
tion perhaps, but no other will do
as well. Our study is not solely
mental nor physical, but with the
attitude of the Greek people in re
gard to the problems of the human
life. In this sense it is right to
speak of Greek religion as advanced
from Greek mythology. It does
not matter so far as our present
purpose is concerned whether the
Greeks were monotheistic or pan
theistic; nor are we obliged to solve
the origin of these gods; nor were
the gods born of the soul or brought
with them. The question of most
importance is that concerning the
importance of these gods. Were
they real beings or did they repre
sent some cosmic force.
Homer with his pathetic voice
sounds all the depths of human
feelings, but is never melancholy.
His world is the world of mythol
ogy rather than the world of relig
ion. In the handling of the myth
of Prometheus we have an attempt
to solve the origin of evil. He
feels that the government of the
world is marked by rank injustice;
that the relation between Zeus and
mortal man is characterized by too
much harshness.
This leads to another conception,
that the ills of the world are due to
the jealousy of the gods. One can
interpret the myth of Prometheus
in this way; when Prometheus
gave men tire he made them in a
measure independent. This was a
sin in the eyes of the gods.
The view taken by Aeschylus was
that not prosperity, but sin was to
be avoided; "whatsoever a man
soweth that shall he reap." Sopho
cles follows up this view and gives
us a sequel to it in the play of
Oedipus.
Two questions now arise: First,
did Greek thought tend to influence
conduct? Second, can we speak of
Greek religion as in no degree speci
fying the mythological sense? To
the first question we can givean af
firmative answer. To the second
our answer must be qualified. In
the earlier period we miss a full ex
pression of this sense in literature.
We should err greatly if we failed
to recognize the gods of worship at
this time.
From the point of view to which
we have listened, we should carry
away two things: That the Greeks
were concerned with the problems
of future life and that their message
is one of serenity and joy. Man may
fail to solve the problems of this
life, but be can do a man's work.
