# On an Iron-Clad Field
## 
### 
The Freshmen were out in force
yesterday to practice for their com
ing struggle. Some of the men art*
playing good football, are in good
condition, and will undoubtedly put
up a good game against Berkeley
next Saturday. Jint these few in
dividual players cannot win a game
by themselves.
The youngsters lined up against
the Varsity fora few moments, but
did not make a particularly good
showing. One of the promising line
men was injured, and may not be
able to take part in the game. His
injury, like many of the frequent
injuries which several of the men
have received recently, was caused
by the poor condition of the field.
It is high time that the manage
ment should awaken to the fact
that the men are compelled to play
upon a field that is shamefully
hard. Not only is this the case,
but the players are not well equip
ped to prevent injuries. Those in
authority should have provided
shin guards and ankle supporters,
and should have had the jerseys
padded before half the Varsity was
laid off on account of sprains and
bruises.
After the Freshman practice the
first and second teams lined up.
Considerable improvement in inter
ference was shown, but this was off
set by high tackling and fumbling.
Fumbling is one thing which can
not be remedied by the coach. It rests
with each man to overcome this
fault.
Fickert showed that he is some
thing of a line bucker by making
some good gains. Frankenheimer
is beginning to get into his old
form and managed to put several
yards behind him every time he
was given the ball. Cochran also
made some splendid gains.
Most of the gains for the second
team were made by B.Thomas, who
managed to make a touchdown.
Overacker is improving in his punt
ing. The play is still too slow. The
teams seem to play in spurts, oc
casionally doing some snappy play
ing, but it is the quick, steady
game which counts.
