# Greek Tragedy.

### 
The call to Greek students re
ceived a response from about fifteen
young men and women. Dr.
Murray presided and addressed the
students informally on Greek plays
in general. lie demonstrated the
difficulty of presenting a Greek
play at Stanford, and said that to
do it well would take nearly two
years preparation. The play must
lirst be carefully translated by the
class of actors and then memorized.
Even the chorus should consist of
upper-class students. To learn the
dancing alone is a difficult and
unique task.
Prof. Miller then discussed the
subject, and the possibilities of giv
ing such a play here. He considered
the amount of enthusiasm and
hard work necessary, the perser
veranceof students, and t he chances
of success.
Prof. Fairelough told of the play
given at Toronto â€”the "Antigone,"
which, including costumes, cost
$5,000. The music is a great fea
ture, and this is hard to render,
but very beautiful and effective.
There was a general attitude of
interest. A committee, consisting
of Dr. Murray, Miss L'hote, and
Mr. Husband, was appointed to
select a play. The meeting ad
journed after considerable enthusi
asm had been shown.
