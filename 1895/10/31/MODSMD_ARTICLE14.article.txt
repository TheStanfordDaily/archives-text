An amusing incident occurred
last night when a member of the
faculty riding a bicycle without a
light, and on the path where wheels
are forbidden, ran into a student.
The unsuspecting student gave free
vent to his wrath until a compan
ion stopped him with the informa
tion that he was talking to a pro
fessor. Of course the tirade ceased,
but the injury was no less serious
than if it had been done by a fresh
man. All wheelmen should observe
the rule concerning those two paths
before some serious accident calls
general attention to this abuse of
rights.
