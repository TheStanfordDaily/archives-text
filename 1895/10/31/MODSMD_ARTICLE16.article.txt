Stanford is coming to the front
in new organizations. We h:ive in
augurated a woman's literary club,
a gymnastic clul>, a dramatic club,
and a Greek play within a week.
Each has possibilities of greatness
in its peculiar lines, if carried on
conscientiously. A university can
not have too many societies and
clubs, for there is always material
among hundreds of intelligent, en
thusiastic ytrung men and women
out of which good results may come.

for the several, talents of different
students, or for the versatility of in
dividuals belonging to more than
one society. It is hard to think of
any line in which some club has not
been organized. Perhaps it were
well to stop extending these clubs,
and put the force into the improve
ment of their quality, so that none
will be nominal and lacking life
and enthusiasm.
