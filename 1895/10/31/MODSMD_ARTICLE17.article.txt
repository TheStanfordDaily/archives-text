A few weeks ago a notice was
published of an offer by a Pittsburg
publication of a prize of $800 for

the best story written by a college
student. The prize is to he divided
between the student and his college
—$200 to the former, $600 to the
latter. There are no conditions rela
tive to subject matter, and the lib
eral length of three thousand words
is allowed. This is a new and tempt
ing offer. Most prize stories include
as competitors all amateurs under a
given age, thus placing them on the
basis of age or of non-professional
ism. The idea of making the stan
dard one of college affiliation is an
innovation, and we shall look for
ward to the result with interest.
The prize, too, is large enough to be
worth working for, and the honor
and pleasure of earning $600 for
scholarships in one's alma water is
a very great incentive. It is strongly
urged that some of our writers exert
themselves in this and similar con
tests.
