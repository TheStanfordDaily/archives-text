Probably few students, in their
sedate, preoccupied college existence,
know that this is Hallowe'en.
It is unfortunate that the merry
customs that used to he in vogue are
slipping away from the practical
young folks of today. Hallowe'en,
or All-Hallowed Evening, originated
in religious superstition, degener
ated into ronftntic superstition,
thence to he handed down to pseudo
superstitious sentimentalism and
practical joking. It is to he la
mented that we are too busy and
too u sensible" to roast chestnuts
over the glowing log,or masquerade
in mirth-provoking costumes of
sheet and pillow-case extraction.
No more does the unsophisticated
maiden tremblingly walk back
wards down the cellar stairs, in
blissful yet fearful anticipation of
seeing her fate. There are no gates to
he unhinged, no pumpkins extant;
yet may we pause in our midnight
preparation of "Herodotus" to
dream one little dream of the mys
teries of the Unknown, and pay one
delicious tribute to the sentiment of
All-Hallowe'en.
