# The
						Butte Team.

### 
During its Northern trip the
Reliance Club team will visit Butte,
Montana, and play the Butte team.
It is prohable that there Reliance
will find its most dangerous oppon
ent. Concerning this team the
University Monitor, ofÂ»the Uni
versity of Nebraska, says:
In the game with Butte, Nebraska
was hopelessly outclassed, as in
weight they looked like pigmies
when they were lined up against
the Butte giants. In the line
Butte had seven men whose com
bined weight was over fourteen
hundred pounds; almost twice as
heavy as our line. Butte knew
nothing of the new rules and the
game was played under the old
rules, which was theessential cause
of our defeat. Mass plays and
wedges were allowed and we could
not stop them. Nebraska did re
markably good work taking all the
disadvantages into consideration.
It was the hardest game Butte has
yet played, and their touchdowns
were made by breaking through
our line and making long runs. It'
the game had been played under
the new rules there is little doubt
but that the score would have been
different and more than likely in
favor of Nebraska.
A notable feature of the game
was an entire absence of slugging.
\Ve 4 were led to believe that this
was all we would get, and we were
agreeably surprised. It was a clean,
gentlemanly game, and we were
given the fairest kind of treatment.
They did not play a vicious game,
nor were there any unfair decisions
by the officials of the game. Butte
seems to have won an unenviable
reputation as to their conduct on
the football field; but if the treat
ment given to Nebraska can be
taken as a standard, these reports
are all wrong, and Butte can treat
a visiting team in a royal good
manner.
