Each man as he came upon the
Held yesterday seemed to breathe a
sigh of relief. The field had been
put into very fair shape and the
element of danger from that source
was removed. The Freshman
eleven practiced signals nearly an
hour. Seven or eight men lined up
against them and in this way tliey
were given considerable aggressive
practice. "Our Youngest" are work
ing very hard and deserve great
credit for their energy and perser
verunee. If they lose the game on
Saturday, it will not be because
they did not try hard enough, but
because their luck was against them
in that there are so few heavy and
experienced men in the class.
K. Smith, I'. Smith, Plate, Over
acker, and Capt. " Billy" Mcintosh
are doing the best work and de
serve success, if only for the true
football spirit which they show.
About live o'clock the Varsity
and Freshmen did some opposition
work. This lasted but a few mo
ments. The second eleven t hen took
its turn against the leaders.
For the first few moments the
play was very snappy and the

Scrubs made frond sized jjra]»s in (lie
opposing line .through which they
forced the hall for good gains.
Soon, however, the Varsity men
"took a brace" and managed to
make repeated touchdowns.
Mr. Camp is developing good in
terference, and the men are begin
ning to put a little more life intothe
game. The article which was put
lip last night bore a very striking
resemblance to football —in places.
But there were long spaces of poor
work. There were fumbles galore,
the tackling was often high, and as
a rule the men failed to get down
on a punt.
The men on the bleachers sat
and shivered and once and awhile
did a little yelling. If they would
do a little more of the latter they
would warm lip and there would be
far less of the former.
The best poilit of last night's
play was Cochran's magnificent
run. lie dashed down tlie field,
dodging here and using the straight
arm there, until he had shaken off
about six men and had carried the
ball forty yards. This same player
did some of the best kicking that
has been seen on the field this year.
Frankenheimer rushed the ball
along in good shape. I Ie is develop
ing fully as strong,if not a stronger
game than he played last year.
Jeffs, at end, made some fine
dashes down the field on punts,
lie is by far the swiftest man on the
liehl in that respect.
Cotton and Spalding each made
several line tackles. 1 hey do not
get down the liehl as quickly as they
should. Williams, Kickert, C.
Thomas, and P>. Thomas worked
hard, and made a very good show
ing.
