## Central American Collecting Expedition. 
### 
Prof. Clias. H. Gilbert will leave
on Dec. 7 for Panama in company
with three or four •students, on a
collecting expedition. This will he
the second winter excursion of this
character, the first having taken
place last year, when Dr. Jordan
made his trip to Mazatlan. Prof.
Gilbert's excursion will occupy
eight weeks or more, and the best
fields in Central America will be
visited.
Dr. Gilbert has already become
thoroughly familiar with the region
he is to visit from two former trips
which he made. The last expe
dition was several years ago, and
for the benefit of Indiana Uni
versity. At that time he made a
very choice collection, spending sev
eral months in that portion of
America. His entire labors were
lost in a fire, which consumed not
only the collection, but some very
valuable data as well.
E. C. Starks will be one of Prof.
(iilbert's party, tlie others not hav
ing been selected as yet. The ex
penses of the collecting trip will be
borne by Mr. Timothy Hopkins,
who. however, is partly repaid by
the orders for duplicate specimens
from other colleges.
