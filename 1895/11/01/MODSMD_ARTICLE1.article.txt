# A
						WORK OF GREAT VALUE.
## Catalogue of Hopkins Railway Library Just Published. 
### 
There has just appeared from
the press of the Commercial Pub
lishing Company of San Francisco
a book which is of much import
ance to Stanford University and of
great interest to outsiders. It
is the catalogue of the Hopkins
Railway Library, compiled by
Frederick .1. Teggart, assistant :
librarian. This is number one of!
t he Publications of the Lei and Stan- j
ford Junior University Library. It
is a small quarto of 281 p:iges, neatly
bound ii\ buckram.
The classification of the books
under various heads is excellent.
Following the body of the book is an
index according to authors which
will enable the reader in a very
short time to find what he wishes
to consult. The title page of all
books is given in full, together with
every item of value in respect to
paging, source, etc., that could be
desired. The formal title is fre
quently followed by phrases from
the book itself indicating its aim or
purpose. Remarkable judgment is
shown in the selection of supple
mentary notes and brief extracts
which follow the title. It abounds
in descriptive notes very helpful
in forming an estimate of the value
of the book or pamphlet.
A ) orson well able to judge as to
the result of the publication of this
work says that its effect will be to
double the usefulness of the Hop
kins Library to students of the
University. He says, furthermore,
that this catalogue will be very val
uable in thesis work and will prob-j
ably be employed a great deal for ;
this purpose hereafter. The pub-j
lication of so comprehensive and
elaborate a catalogue of a special j
department will secure for the |
Leland Stanford Junior University
Library a wide recognition among I
librarians and scientific men all
over the world.
In the introduction bv Prof.
Woodruff, it is pointed out that the
collection of books in the Hopkins
Railway Library has grown from
2,000 titles in April, I<S92, to 9,245
books and pamphlets at the present
time. The collection of this Li
brary was begun by Mr. Hopkins
when he first entered the railway
service and was continued by him
up to April, 1892, when he pre
sented it to the University, at the
same time providing for its main
tenance and increase until com
plete. Purchases have been made
systematically since that time and
the Hopkins Railway Library is
today one of the most complete of
its kind in the world.
It is not known to a certainty
whether we can claim the honor of
having the largest railway library
in the world or not. Jt seems,
however, that we can lay justelaim
to this distinction. According to
Ili'tU's Enevklopiidiedes Eisenbahn
wesens there are 7,200 volumes in
the library of the Wurtemburg
state railroads. In the library of
the Austrian Xnrdhahn, there are
2,800 volumes, and 800 volumes in
the library of the Austro-Hungary
state railroad. Fifteen years ago
the Prussian Department of Public
Works published a catalogue of

their entire collection and the por
tion dealing with railroads em
braced then about 1,500 volumes. |
Possibly these are not so exclusively
devoted to railroads as is the Hop
kins Library.
At Brussels, the office of the In
ternational Railway Congress con
tains a large library; as does also
the office of the International Com- j
mission for Freight Transportation
at Berne; but there are no statistics j
concerning either of them. In
London, both the library of the!
Railway Department of the Board
of Trade and the library of the
Railway Clearing House contain
a considerable collection of books)
pertaining to railroads. There are
a number of libraries where this |
class of books is not separated
which would probably make a j
large showing if we knew of them.
The British Museum doubtless has!
many railway books in its vast 1
library, but they are not kept in aj
body. In the United States, there
are a few large collections; but ap-'
parently none to con j pa re with the!
Hopkins collection. The office of
Poor's Railroad Manual in New]
York has a large private collection,!
as has also tlie American Society of j
Civil Engineers. The Railroad
Man's Christian Association of New
York has an extensive library for
the use of railway employes.
The part of the Hopkins Library j
likely to attract the most attention !
is the department devoted to Eco
nomics. Here there is quite a!
number of books treating of agri-1
culture and railways, canals and
railways, finance, monopolies, rail -■
ways and the state —giving tlie re-j
lations of the railway and the state
in Austria, France, (Jermany, and i
many other foreign countries, and j
the United States—railways in
politics, rates, and taxation*
It is interesting to note the num
ber of periodicals devoted to rail
roads and railroad men. There
are about eleven hundred volumes
of this class of literature alone in
j the Library. At the present time
sixty-nine periodicals are received
regularly.
In the early days of railroad
construction in this country, it was
simply a matter of connecting dis
tant parts of our territory by bands
of steel and of putting on any kind
of rolling stock that would answer
the purposes of transportation.
With the development of the
country and the competition of new
lines, the attention of railway
managers has been turned to little
I economies in the equipment and
operation of roads. A very small
item of expense now often means
j the success or failure of a vast rail
j way system. This brings up
'questions which we have not had
heretofore to deal with and "which
we are often unable to confront.
Naturally we are driven to consult
the experiences of those who have
dealt with the same problems. The
railroads of Europe encountered
these difficulties long ago and this
I accounts for the fact that most of
j the literature on the subject is in
French, Italian, and German.
This is not so much an era of
i railroad building as it is of rail
road operation. The importance of
| the latter increases in proportion
as the importance of the latter di

minishes. The line of promotion
in railway management has shifted
from the fireman, the brakeman,
and the conductor to the civil
engineer and economist. Since
this is the case and the demand for
educated railroad men is so rapidly
increasing, Stanford University is
to be congratulated upon the pos
session of so complete a library
bearing on this particular subject.
