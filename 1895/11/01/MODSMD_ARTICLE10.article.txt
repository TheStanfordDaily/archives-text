The action of the Executive Com
mittee on last Wednesday evening,
in requesting all organizations that
expect to use the Stanford name to
present constitutions before that
body, was an eminently proper one.
The fact that each organization
must submit its constitution to the
Executive Committee of the Asso
ciated Students, virtually puts the
control of such college institutions
into the hands of the student body.
It may seem, in the present in
stance, that a hardship will be
worked on the few students who
are working up the Thanksgiving
night entertainment in San Fran
cisco, but a satisfactory compromise
will doubtless be effected, whereby
they will be properly rewarded for
their enterprise and energy.
