The last practice of the Fresh
man eleven is over. Tomorrow they
will leave for San Francisco, where
in the afternoon at Central Park
the game with the U. C. team will
lie played. All considered, the out
look is gloomy. Several of the U.C.
freshmen will make the varsity this
year, and many more will play
subs. In our Freshman team, on
the other hand, there are none, with
probably one exception, that will
make the Varsity this year. They
have practiced hard, it is true, and
the only hope seems to be that they
will make up in agility of play what
they lack in weight.
Whatever the result of the game,
our Freshmen have worked conscien
tiously. Let them play a hard, con
scientious game, a courageous even
though a losing one. Then if de
feat meets them, it will carry with
it no disgrace; if they win, the vic
tory will he doubly glorious.
