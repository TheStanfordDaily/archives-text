In this age of sharp competition,
where every student realizes that
his success in life must depend
greatly upon the foundation he lays
in college, the conscientious student
goes to a university with but one
idea in mind : hard, long, and se
vere work in some special course by
(he aid of which he may in life ob
tain a livlihood and, as he hopes,
something more. It is the success
of the future that holds him firmly
in the harness. In some cases it is
the only incentive he has to work.
Ignoring every course of study
which in his mind does not pertain
directly to the needs of his spec
ialty, and to his subsequent sue

cess, his immediate associations are
naturally confined to his depart
ment, and the social side of life
made to suffer thereby. Forgetful of
the fact that the success of the pres
ent business man depends greatly
upon the social side of his character
and upon the power of Ins acquaint
ances, these same are doing that
which they should most avoid; they
are working against their own suc
cess. *
