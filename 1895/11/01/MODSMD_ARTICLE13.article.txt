Stanford University has at
tracted to itself a number of earnest
students whose support while here
devolves entirely upon themselves.
Many of them, unfortunately, have
entered the University without suf
ficient financial resources, being en
tirely dependent upon their earn
ings while here or upon the small
accumulation made before entering.
This is likely to lead to so economi
cal a style of living that the man
really injures himself. Several such
cases are known to at least one
member of the faculty. In an effort
to gain an education the ambition
of many of these students is doing
them a life-long injury. The body
must be properly nourished or the
mental forces can not properly do
their work. It is a foolish policy to
strive to live as near the starvation
limit as possible in order to secure
the learning one may receive here.
There seems to be no practical
remedy for cases where students
stint themselves voluntarily; yet
they will go away from here, if
they are at last able to graduate,
with an impoverished vitality which
they may never be able to recuper
ate.
