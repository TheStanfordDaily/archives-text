# Numerous Touchdowns.
## 
### 
There was a large crowd out to |
see the practice yesterday, but very ;
little enthusiasm was shown. The
spectators show more of a spirit to
josh than to give the men a good
send off.
The playing was such as to call
forth applause, but the applause
was not forthcoming in sufficient
quantities.
The first team had an easy time
of it with the Scrubs, making touch
downs in one, two, three order.
There were very few heavy men
on the second eleven, but three
extra men were added to make up
for this deficiency.
The play was an improvement
over that of the previous practices
in quickness and interference. In
fact the interference was exceed-!
ingly good. The weak point on the
Varsity seemed to be in the line,
for when the second team gained
the ball they went through the
center for good gains.
The Scrubs kicked off at the be
ginning of play for about twenty
live yards. Spalding captured
the ball and carried it forward
thirty yards. Frankenheimer was
then given the ball, and behind
tine interference, scored a touch
down. This brought forth the only
real cheering of the evening.
Garton seemed stronger for his
several days rest and followed the
ball much better than usual. He
made some good tackles and did
some fair interfering. Fickert also
did some good work in stopping
the runner behind the line.
Weldon made a touchdown from
near the center of the field. He was
materially aided in this by Spald
ing, who blocked off a number of
taeklers.
When the second team had
worked the ball down to the Var
sity's twenty-five yard line, all of
the second team men were put in
the line, and Weldon was called
over to try fora field goal. On the
first attempt he missed by a wide
margin, but on his second trial he
sent the ball soaring over the heads
of the players and missed a goal by
i only a yard.
The third long run to result in a
i touchdown was made by Cotton be
hind Code's interference.
All through the work the Scrubs
proved themselves lamentably weak
in breaking up interference and in
I tackling. With a few good taeklers
on the lighter team many of the
long runs might have been cut
short.
