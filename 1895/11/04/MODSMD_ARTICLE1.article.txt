# COMPLETELY OUTCLASSED.
## Berkeley's Freshman Rushers Too Heavy for Stanford's Light Line. 
### 
The game on Saturday between
the rival Freshman teams of Stan
ford and Berkeley was too one
sided an affair to interest an un
biased spectator. To Berkeley ad
herents the game was cause for an
unlimited amount of enthusiasm,
while to the few Stanford sup
porters who witnessed the match
there was reason for nothing but
chagrin.
Captain Mcintosh played an
astonishing game for so light a
man. His utter disregard of bruises
and his fierce tackles saved Stan
ford from a far worse defeat. He
was in every play,and simply wore
himself to niter exhaustion. Had
all the team played with the dash
of their quarterback the score would
not have been a shameful one.
Plate also did well, making three
specially fine tackles at critical mo
ments, and running twice with the
ball for long gains after Berkeley's
punts. Considering Enimett's light
weight and his inexperience, he
worked hard at center; he was op
posed to a man weighing forty
pounds more than himself, and yet
managed to hold him back at sev
eral periods of the game.
Berkeley displayed remarkable
proficiency in interference, and tbe
work of her heavy line-men wasad
mirable. Her ends and tackles
played all around the Stanford
men, who really put up a far poorer
game than they do in daily prac
tice.
The teams lined-up as follows:
1> EHK El. K V STANFORD
Greisberg . . . center Ernmett
•lessen r guard 1. . Mackinnon
Walthall I guard r. . . Whitmire

Kaarsburg . .fullback. . . Overacker
llarrv Walton and Sinnus of the
Reliance alternated referee and um
pire, while Smith of the Olympics
acted as linesman. Stanford took
* the ball for the first kick-off and
Overacker sent the pig-skin whirl
ing thirty-five yards over the heads
of Berkeley men. Hall caught tbe
ball and ran it down the field fif
teen yards when tackled. Berkeley
then began a steady hammering
against the Stanford line and with
each attempt she made a large gain.
In passing the ball Berkeley was
very sure and made but two bad
fumbles during the. match. Hall
and Carr each smashed Stanford's
line for repeated gains. Mcintosh
was in every tackle and on the ten
yard line saves Stanford from a
touchdown by bis fine work. The
Stanford men braced up fora mo
ment at this stage of ihe game
and held Berkeley for two downs
without gains; then a mass play
was tried and Carr went over the
line for the first touchdown, six
minutes after Ihe first kick-off.
The ball was in Stanford's posses
sion but once and was immediately
lost on a fumble. Bender failed to
kick the goal. Score, 4to 0.

Overacker again kicks off for
twenty yards. Carr ran the ball l
liiick twelve yards for Berkeley.
Two more bucks take tbe ball into
Stanford territory. Hill and Car
ter were each given the ball and
made good gains. Hall made a
star run at this period of play. He
got ahead of his interferers and
with an apparently clear field made
for Stanford's goal line. Plate had
his eye on Hall, however, and
downed him in line style. Berke
ley lost eight yards on a fumble
but regained j art of the territory
and finally lost ihe ball on downs.
Stanford attempted a long pass
to the eiid, but Berkeley broke
through, causing a fumble and
several yards loss of ground. An
other try is made but Stanford's
runner is downed behind the line.
Berkeley got the ball on Stanford's
live-yard line. A long push and a
strong push nets Berkeley four
points more, making the score S to
0 within ten minutes after the game
was called. Bender failed again
to kick an easy goal.
The next kick-off from the center
of the Held was for thirty-five yards,
but it didn't count for much as
Carr returned the ball fifteen yards,
when tackled by Mcintosh. A try
at Stanford's center gave Berkeley
four yards. In just ten plays the
ball was pushed over the Stanford

first half ended. Score, 20-0.
Berkeley opened the second half
with a thirty-five yard kick-off by
Kaarsburg. Plate gathered in the
high Hv and swept down the field
twenty-five yards before being
downed. The criss-cross gave Stan
lord but three yards, a long pass to
the end, which is badly fumbled, re
sults in a slight train, and Mcintosh
is pushed through the center for
two yards. The pigskin went to
Berkeley on downs.
Hall, Carr, and Kaarsburg are
depended on for U. C.'s gains and
they respond with another touch
down, Mcintosh seeming to be about
the only one who got in the way of
the runners. Kaarsburg kicked
the goal. Score, 2(> to 0.
Overacker made a poor kick-off.
Simpson bringing back the ball to

on mass plays to score her next
touchdown. Two end runs were
made by Kaarsburg and one by
Hall. Simpson is sent through the
line for the sixth touchdown, and
Kaarsburg is found equal to
another goal kick. Score, 82 to 0.
The kick-off by Overacker covers
thirty yards, but it took Berkeley
just eleven plays to score another
touchdown, Simpson again being
pushed across the line and Kaars
burg added two more points by
kicking the goal. Score, MS to 0.
Overacker kicked-off f or thirty
yards. A series of quick plays car
ried tbe bail into Stanford's field
and in four minutes U. C. again
scores and Kaarsburg kicks his
sixth goal. Score 44 0. Time.
