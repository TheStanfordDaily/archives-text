The following letter has been re
ceived from 'the Goethe-Schiller-
Denkmal Gesellschait von Calil'or
nien. It is self-explanatory.
To the President and Faculty of the
Behind Stanford Jr. University,
Palo Alto.
Gentlemen —Commencing Tuesday,
Nov. 5, to Saturday, Nov. 9,
this association has arranged in
Mechanics' Pavilion, under the aus
pices of interested ladies, a Goethe-
Schiller Festival, for the purpose of
raising funds to erect, in Golden
Gate Park, a monument to these
great poets.
This monument is intended to
beautify the park as well as to re
mind our growing generation of
.the high rank assigned to Ger
many's great classical poets in the
literature of the world.
This association is aware that
hundreds of students are now study
ing the German language and Ger
man literature at your University.
In addition to the value of the Ger
man language in the affairs of daily
life, we believe tbe study of tbe
works of these immortal poets will
surely cultivate a lofty apprecia
tion of the highest ideals in art and
literature, and that the erection of
the monument should be received
with interest and sympathy, es
pecially by the universities in Cali
fornia.
The management, therefore, takes
pleasure in extending a respectful
invitation to the members of the
faculty and their families to attend
the festival.
Individual invitation and admis
sion tickets have been placed in the
hands of Prof. Goebel to be dis
tributed to all those who wish to
honor us with their presence. Very
respectfully,
ti <ETIIE-SCHILLEIt MONUMENT
Association of California.
Charles Bundsc.hu, Pres.
Members of the Faculty who wish
to have tickets will apply to Prof.
Goebel.
