The punishment administered to
our Freshmen on Saturday, al
though a bitter pill to swallow, may
prove a blessing to Stanford. It
showed, for one thing, that our
friends across the bay have some
excellent material from which to
choose a team, and that they will
be able to put strong elevens on the
held for four years at least. It
also showed us that we will have
to work very hard to be able to
win the game on Thanksgiving
day. It is doubtful if our Varsity
could have defeated our Freshman
team with as great ease as did the
Berkeley class team; therefore every
loyal Stanford student should lend
bis aid in every possible way to
help our players to win the big
event. Let the students appear
upon the field each evening in
large numbers and do their utmost
to encourage the football squad.
This can be done by showing the
men that their interests are the
interests of the whole student body.
Veiling should be made a feature
of each practice. Successful yell
ing can be done only when the
crowd is divided into squads and
each squad has its leader. On
Saturday the cheering of the Berke
ley sympathizers was almost per
fect and served to a great extent to
dispirit our men.
The management of our team
should see that every possible thing
is done to aid the men who come
out as candidates. The men should
be properly equipped to guard
against possible injury, and the
gridiron kept in perfect condition.
The players themselves should
take more interest in the game.
They should be on the Held
promptly at the hour set for prac
tice and should follow the instruc
tions of the coach and captain.
Because a man is placed upon
the second eleven is no reason why
he should give up football. He
should have enough college spirit
to give up his personal interest to
help along those of his college. A
team can never win unless it has a
strong eleven to practice against;
besides it is no small honor to be
able to play upon the second team.
The Varsity men are chosen from
that source. A second eleven man
has excellent chances of making
substitute on the first team, and if
he is persevering and painstaking
a year or two of experience upon

the Scrub team may win him a
place as represenative of his alma
mater in the great game. The
second team has taken one or two
trips each year, and will do the
same this year.
Laying all of this aside, what
greater inducement could a man
want than to see the cardinal
wave triumphantly over the blue
and gold on Thanksgiving day and
to feel that he had done his share
to add another victory to Stan
ford's long list?
As things stand now we are the
under dog and it will take no end
of work and enthusiasm to put us
on top again Where we belong.
One man can't do it and eleven
men can't do it —it will take the
combined effort of the whole
student body.
