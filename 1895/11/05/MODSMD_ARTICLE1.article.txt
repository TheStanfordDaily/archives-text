# The 						Sunday Sermon.

### 
Dr. Jordan delivered the sermon
in the chapel Sunday morning on
the subject "Obedience." Mr. F. V.
Pollock of the Bostonians sang the
solo. While not especially notable
for power or volume, his voice is a
very pleasing one, being agreeable
in tone and sufficient in compass,
lie sang with refinement and a con
siderable degree of religious feeling.
Mr. Pollock is a protege of Dr.
Gunsaulus, and sang for some time
in the latter's church in Chicago.
Dr. Jordan said in part as fol
lows:
In the thirty-eighth chapter of
Job we read, "Hitherto shalt thou
come, but no furher; and here
shall thy proud waves be stayed. 1 '
In Iceland the nights are very
long, and the people sit around the
fireplace telling the tales of old
Norway. And from Iceland we
learn how that Thor, the god of
thunder, made a journey to Jotun
heim accompanied by Loke and
Thialfi. They slept one night in a
strange house, the door of which
occupied one whole side. Presently
they were frightened by a terrible
noise; which they learned on the
next day, however, to be the snor
ing of the huge giant Skrymir, the
god of frost. Skrymir volunteered
bis company and treated the party
kindly, but they became suspicious
of him, and Thor decided to kill
him. Accordingly, while Skrymir
was sleeping, Thor seized his great
hammer and hurled a mighty blow
upon his head. Hut neither by
this nor by two more still mightier
blows was Thor able to do more
than to momentarily arouse the
giant from bis slumbers.
On his arrival in Jotunheim,
Thor was ridiculed by the Jiituns
(or giants) for his physical weak
ness. They gave him a horn of
liquor, but he could not drink it
empty; they showed him a large
cat and asked him to lift it, but he
could barely lift one its paws; he
next tried in a wrestle to vanquish
an old woman whom they pointed
out, but he failed ignominiously.
On the departure of Thor and
his companions, the chief of the
Jbtuns told Thor not to be so much
ashamed of his weakness: the horn
he had tried to drink was the sea,
which was caused by his efforts
only to ebb; the cat which he at
tempted to lift was a great world
serpent which tail in mouth en
circled and held the world together
—to have lifted it would have been
to scatter the world asunder; the
old woman who put him to shame
was Time. Finally, the Jotun told
Thor that the three strokes of bis
hammer had left the three valleys
which he saw before him—the
Jotun was Skrymir again; Skrymir
the old, chaotic, racky earth; but
Skrymir vanished, and out of the
distance came the taunt, "Better
come no more to Jotunheim!"
The lesson that comes out of all
this is that Thor and all the rest of
us are great and powerful, but that
the secret of our power is our knowl
edge of our limitations.
Now, obedience is right. That
action is right that is life-favoring;
and that action is wrong that is
life-destroying. If we can give life
more abundantly to others by de
stroying ourselves, that is right.

But obedience is to act in accord
with time and reality; not neces
sarily obedience to what we con
ceive things to be, but to things as
they really are. We do not know
j what reality really is; but we can
approach it. And our conception
j of God is only an approach toward
| the true conception of reality.
But if we can only work in ac
cord with reality it is just as easy
! to accomplish the great things as
the small. Lowell says that "Three
things bear up dominion —knowl-
edge, will, obedience." Apply this
to the giants. We must first know
I what the giants are. Second, we
must have the will to do that which
is right, for freedom to choose
means duty to choose aright. It" we
have the knowledge, without the
will to obey, this knowledge be
comes the means of our destruc
tion. There are a great many ani
mals and men who can not see
j clearly what is right. And it is in
; this connection that we see the im
j portance of the many instincts
! which animals have —they are im
! pulses to obedience, and they in
here in all animals in one way or
j another; and the animal which re
l sponds most obediently to these im
j pulses survives; the others die. The
j snail knows that in order to lie safe
! he must draw himself into his shell,
j and he accordingly does so. Indeed,
; nature sometimes causes a kind of
] illusion to pleasure, or a bribe to
obedience, as may be seen in the
snake which swallows a whole live
mouse and then crawls off into some
j secluded place there to lie until it
is digested. Certainly it realizes no
real pleasure in gorging itself in
! this way. So with us : we are kept
! in obedience by impulses of various
kinds, all of which have their use
ful purposes. Our intelligence is
not sufficient, for by it we could not
be obedient in the highest sense.
The force of altruism is just as
I strong as the force of hunger, but
:we do not stop to think over the
I necessity of being altruistic. There
I may be a choice as to how one be
! comes obedient, but, as Lowell says,
I obedience is the tap-root of the
! whole thing.
Whatever be the cause of the
j obedience, it always has something
good in it. It has been said that
j sooner or later there will be but
two churches, the church of author
ity and the church of reason. It is
' not always important what the
source of obedience is ; whether it
j comes from within — from a mix
; ture of appetites and passions and
all that goes to make up conscience—
|or from authority and conven
tions. A large part of our program
is made up for us by our ancestors
and by conventions. And since
conventions indicate the path of
safety, we may in the majority of
, instances do all that is required of
I us in our pursuit of obedience by
; following conventionalities.
Then, as to the church of author
ity.—\\ e have heard of ships going
out under "sealed orders"; that
is, the mission of the voyage is con
cealed from all on board, save
probably one, the captain, the re
mainder of the crew and officers
being commanded only to obey.
Such voyages have been productive
of very great good. And so with
many of us: by exemplifying in

our own lives what someone else
has said or done we may accom
plish a beautiful and useful mis
sion. That which makes it so is
our obedience to reality, which
someone before us has seen and
been guided by. Indeed it is this
feeling of obedience that is the
strength and foundation of our
churches, and their mission in life
lies with those who have the knowl
edge and power to give "sealed
orders."
Now it is good for us that so
many of these sealed orders are
given us, for if one opens his book
of orders then he has nothing to
fall back upon but his own intel
lect, and if he fail in his intellect lie
must abide by its test. When
orders are sealed, we look to higher
and better intellect.
Again, there must in all life be
someone to furnish these sealed
orders. And the necessary quali
fication for such an one is the
power of choosing. Hence the de
mand for knowledge. Things that
were safe for our grandfathers will
not be safe for us, and these facts
must be discovered and pointed out
to us by those who have the power;
who are able to perceive the will of
Clod — for God permits only the
right to endure. The strength of
the Puritans did not lie in such
tilings as their refusal to kiss their
wives on Sunday, but rather in
their implicit obedience. If my
teachings are what I would have
them they spring from this same
spirit of obedience. The recogni
tion of obedience which science
follows attempts no excuse for non
obedience: "The soul that sinneth,
it must die."
But as these conventionalities do
not really feed one, some people
are l*d to believe that life is all
sham and illusion, and that neither
we nor our childern are really
worth raising. These men have
opened the sealed orders, and
are now relying upon their own
knowledge and will, both of which
have proved weak and incompetent.
But true obedience will bring us
not to the feeling that we should
die, but to a strong desire to see
God and Life.
