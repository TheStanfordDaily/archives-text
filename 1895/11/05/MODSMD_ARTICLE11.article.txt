The Curtis Law Club heard the
case of Anderson vs. Brown last
night. The facts in the case were
as follows: On January 1, 1895,
in Han Francisco offered to
sell Anderson in New York 100
shares of stock at par. Brown's
offer was delivered to Anderson in
New York on Jan. 0, 1895. On the
same day Anderson posted a letter
of acceptance. On the corner of
the envelope containing the accept
ance was printed "If not called for in
live days return to Anderson, New
York." On Jan. 7, 1895, Brown
wired a revocation of his offer to
Anderson. Anderson then brought
suit for the stock, which has risen
in value. Argument: Did the
printed notice invalidate the ac
ceptance?
The case was argued before
DeWolfe, chief justice, and \V. 11.
Crow, F. D. Wills, 1). O. Bigelow,
and A. B. Morgan, associates.
Oskison and Stowe acted as
attorneys for Brown, while Roth
rock and Stansbery upheld the
cause of Anderson.
The arguments were good on both
sides. The decision will be given
at the next regular meeting. Prof.
Abbott was present and made a
very interesting talk to the mem
bers of the club.
