In spite of the inclement weather
we are now having preparations for
"As You Like It" are going on.
Everything will be in readiness to
present the play Friday afternoon;
but in case of rain, there will be
nothing left to do but to postpone
it fora few days. However, it is
improbable that the storm will con
tinue for so long a time at this sea
son of the year.
Tickets will be put on sale at the
postoffice tomorrow. Everyone who
intends to go will do well to secure
their seats then, and not wait until
the day cif the performance; for it
will be presented only on a good
day, and the seating capacity will
no doubt be crowded to the utmost.
From an artistic point of view
this presentation will far surpass
the original at Sutro Heights. The
cast will be better and a more fin
ished interpretation will be given.
Mr. Jerome Sykes of the Boston
ians has been secured to play the
part of Jaques. Mr. Sykes plays
Guy of Gisbouon in "Bobin Hood,"

and is conceded to be one of the
finest actors now with the lJoston
ians. Miss Pauline French who, as
Celia, carried off the honors of the
day in the original performance,
will play Rosalind. Mr. Miehling
of the Olympic Club, and the cham
pion wrestler of the Coast, will be
Charles tlie Wrestler. Mr. Frank
Armstrong will play Orlando, a
role admirably adopted to him.
All members of the cast are equally
as capable of making the play a
success, and one long to he remem
bered.
