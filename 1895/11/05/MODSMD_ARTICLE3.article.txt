It was 5:15 before the team lined
u]> for practice yesterday. This is
entirely too late an hour to begin
work. The men when they sign
the pledge promise to answer the
call of the coach and captain. Some
of the players do follow their
leaders' instructions, hut the
majority seem to think that when
they have signed their names to
the paper that they have done their
duty and if they are thirty minutes
late to practice it makes no differ
ence. It does make a decided
difference. It is discouraging to
the captain and coach to stand
around an hour waiting for the
players. Besides, when practice
begins at live, there is very little
I time left for work.
The bleachers were well tilled
with on-lookers, and about a dozen
of them did their best to arouse a
little enthusiasm. The rest watched
the game, with languid interest.
The teams were lamentably slow
in lining up. After a run or a
punt, the men would come down
the held "with measured tread and
slow," and take their places as if
there was all the time in the world.
Sometimes the ball■ was'snapped
back before half the men were in
line; but, of course, that made no
difference—two or three men, who
were always in the play, could do
the work for themselves and the
others.
Harry Reynolds made some good
runs, Code ran some good interfer
ence, Fickert got out into the plays
well, Jeffs, Harrington, Carle, Cot
ton, and Spalding did good work;
the rest took things easy.
Fisher, a new man, was out and
showed that he has football in him
if he will master the rules and
work hard.
