The Goethe-Schiller Festival,
which begins at the Mechanics'
Pavilion in San Francisco tomor
row, will doubtless draw quite a
number from Stanford, especially
of those who are studying German.
This festival has been arranged at
a great expense of time and labor
and will certainly be well worth
attending. A number of well
known German plays will be pre
sented during the week. Students
interested in this class of German
literature will do well to take ad
vantage of this opportunity. It
will probably not be offered soon
again.
