The success that has attended
the sale of tickets for "As You Like
It" is very gratifying to the man
agement of the Annual. Yet there
are many who signed the lists cir
culated who have not purchased
tickets. These should not get the
mistaken idea that the enterprise
is an assured financial success and
that therefore they are released
from any obligation to help it
along. Many more tickets must
be sold before any appreciable
profit is netted for the Annual. It
is not enough that the junior's
publication shall simply not lose
money in the presentation of the
play; it must clear a respectable
sum or the purpose of the enterprise
has failed. Success is now certain
if all those who signed the lists
purchase tickets.
