Some of our undergraduates need
to go back to the primary schools
and re-learn that fundamental
point in scholastic disciplineâ€”don't
whisper in school. In the library
during the past week there have
been times when close application
was impossible, owing to the con
tinual buzz of conversation kept
up by those who were discussing
their own affairs at the expense of
the rights of others. Evidently
there is a misconception as to the
proper use of the library. It is not
a general assembly hall nor a place
set apart for social recreation; it is
for study pure and simple.
The half dozen persons who dis
turb a hundred others by working
out translations together or debat
ing on knotty points in law during
study hours are deserving of the
severest condemnation.

"Unless more men turn out for
daily practice we might just as
well give Berkeley the champion
ship without a match this year."
said Walter Camp last evening.
No one can deny that he had
ample reason for his remarks.
lie has left his own alma mater's
team and his business in the East
to get Stanford in shape for
another victory over Berkeley; he
has given up six weeks of his val
uable time to a college in which he
has become immensely interested;
and has his reputation of never
losing a game at stake. Despite
all this he sees fewer men appear
ing each evening for practice.
Have Stanford men who are cap
able of playing good football so lost
all college spirit and patriotism
that they are unwilling to lend
their aid in defeating Berkeley?
Or are they so shortsighted as to
think that because certain players
exceed them in ability they have
no hope of making the team and
will therefore give up football?
Do they know that they are sel
lishly throwing Stanford's football
supremacy in the dust by such a pol
icy? Surely they are not going to fail
Stanford when they are most needed.
Not a single player is sure of bis
place on the team; there is plenty
of chance fora hard, earnest
worker to make the Varsity. Even
though be should fail in this, is it
not a sufficient reward for him to
feel that he has helped Stanford
win a third great victory by forcing
some other man to play harder in
order not to lose his place?
Let each one of those fifty players
who have suits out, work with that
same vigor displayed during the
early part of October and the cardi
nal will not lower before the blue
and gold this year.
