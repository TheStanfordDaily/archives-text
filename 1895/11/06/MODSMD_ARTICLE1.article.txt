# The 						Olympics Score Against Stanford.
## 
### 
When Stanford and Olympic,
lined up at 4:80 yesterday Central
Park looked like a relief map, with j
its rivers, lakes, islands, and pen-1
insulas, rather than a gridiron!
Held. The rain had been falling;
fora number of hours and con
tinued to do so throughout t he game.
Asa result the suits which have
served the Stanford men through
one season and which they will be j
compelled to wear for another sea
son, became decidedly damp.
About twentv-live Olympic sym
pathizers braved the inclement !
wpather and enjoyed the game from
the grandstand and side-lines.
Most of these were "deadheads,"
so that the treasury of the club was
not overcrowded with shekels after
the game.
The game itself was in keeping
with the weather and the grounds.
In fact the whole affair might be
said to be "a dead cold frost."
Stanford won the toss and chose
the south goal, or rather the side
where the south goal should have
been, for there were no goal posts.
Olympic kicked off and Stanford
got the ball. After about five min
utes of play the ball was forced
across the Olympic goal line fora
touchdown. Score, 4 to 0, in Stan
ford's favor. This touchdown was
gained principally through line
bucking and short end runs.
Olympic again kicked off, and
.the ball rolled in touch. On the
second kick-off Stanford gained
possession of the ball, and man
aged to carry it back to the center
by a series of downs without losing
possession. After a few more scrim
mages, in which Stanford made
short gains, Cochran took the ball
and made a line run of twenty
yards, and was downed by McNear.
By bucking the center Stanford
carried the ball to within a foot of
the line. Weldon was then given
the ball, and carried it over for the
second touchdown. Score: Stanford
8, (Mynipic 0.
For the rest of the half the ball
was kept in Olympic territory, and
time was called with the ballon
their twenty-live-yard line. Length
of lirst half, twenty minutes.
Several changes were made in
the line-up of both teams for the
second half. It was agreed to play
but fifteen minutes on account of
the lateness of the hour. Stanford
kicked off and Olympic drove the
ball up the lield, but it was soon
forced back by Stanford. Olympic
gained possession of the ball on
their own seven-yard line. McNear
attempted to kick, but was com
pelled to make a safety. Score:
Stanford 10, Olympic 0.
The airbag went to Olympic on
the twenty-five yard line, and by
end runs and heavy pushing
Olympic rushed it along to the
center of the field. Here "Pete"
Smith took the ball and made a
splendid run of twenty-live yards.
Things were looking dark for the
cardinal, but the ball went to Stan
ford ten yards from the go:il line.
The ball was passed back fora
kick, but Weldon did not have
time to punt it <>ut and was com
pelled to down it, scoring a safety
for Olympic. Score, 10 to 2 in
Stanford's favor. Thus the score

stood to the end of the game, which
ended with the ball at the center.
Our men showed several weak
points. Of course some of the poor
playing was attributable to the
weight and slippery condition of I
the field, but even then they are in
excusable.
Our men broke through the line
repeatedly, but failed to tackle or
break up the interference after get- j
ting through. The worst work was
in the pushing. Olympic was able!
to gain a yard or two each time'
they shoved, while our men gave up I
immediately and failed to get down I
low enough to stop the advance
of the opponents.
