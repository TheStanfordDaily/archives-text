The victory of Tammany in the
New York elections yesterday is a
discouraging check to the cause of
good municipal government. It
seems to have been brought about
largely by the narrowness and dis
sension of the leaders on the oppo
sition. Whatever the merits of the
methods advocated by each par
ticular division, the fact remains
that they were unable to resist the
forces of corrupt municipal govern
ment.
The details of this struggle ought
to mean much to the undergradu
ates of the American universities.
A great majority of the leaders in
these "good citizenship" movements
are college graduates. In New
York, for example, Parkhurst,
Strong, Roosevelt, and scores of
minor leaders are university men.
The present undergraduates must
furnish the leaders of the future in
such reforms.
