Tite interest taken in the dra
matic performance of "As You Like
It" is intensified as the time draws
near for its presentation. Faculty
members as well as students have
shown a serious desire to further
the success of the performance in
every way, and have given it the
encouragement that it deserves.
The sale of tickets thus far has
been highly gratifying and there is
every prospect of a financial as well
as an artistic success to be ex
pected.
The fact that an undertaking of
such magnitude as this can be
brought to a satisfactory culmina
tion by the energy of Stanford stu

dents is a cause for self-congratu
lation ; but there is more to be
noted in this matter than the mere
success of a theatrical performance,
and that is the willingness with
which all the students of the Uni
versity have aided a student enter
prise. It proves that there is a
strong band of sympathy uniting
Stanford students, and that there is
a unity of sentiment which will do
much to make Stanford University
powerful in all its undertakings.
