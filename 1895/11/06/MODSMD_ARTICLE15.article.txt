Berkeley's latest move in work
ing up enthusiasm for the Thanks
giving day game is the appoint
ment of an individual student to
write a college song. Their lead
ers seem to be leaving no stone
unturned in the organization of
their forces. If U. C. does not on
that day strike terror to the hearts
of her rival's team, win the sym
pathy of the "unattached" in the
crowd, and urge her own team on
to victory, it will not be because she
has lacked energetic, inventive
leaders.
Meanwhile the natural leaders of
like organizations at Stanford are
doing nothing. Not a single move
has yet been made either to giveour
football men proper encouragement
during the practice games at home
or to prepare to make a respectable
showing in the face of Berkeley and
the public. Stanford men have
not needed in the past to surrender
the palm for ingenuity and enter
prise to any one. If members of
the other class want to demon
strate that all such genius did
not leave the University with
the Class of '95 it is certainly about
time for them to begin.
