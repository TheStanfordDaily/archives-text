# Importance of Athletics.

Prof. Hadley of Yale contributes
an article on "The position of col
lege athletics" to the October Bache
lor of Arts, from which the follow
ing is extracted:
The development of college ath
letics has been of great service in
contradicting some of tlie danger
ous tendencies of the day. Open
to criticism as athletics may I>e for
their unnecessary expense, for the
betting which goes on in connection
with them, and for the distorted
views which they encourage as to the
relative importance of different
things in life, they yet have a place
in education which is of overwhelm
ing importance. The physical
training which they involve, good
as it may be, is but a small part of
the benefit achieved. The moral
training is greater. Where scores
of men are working bard for ath
letic honor, and hundreds more are
infected by their spirit, the moral
force of such an emulation is not
to be despised.
Critics may object, and do ob
ject, that athletic prowess is un
duly exalted, and that it involves
distortion of facts to rate the best
football player, or best oarsman,
higher than the best scholar or best
debater. Hut the critic is not
wholly right in this. There is a
disposition in the college world to
recognize in the highest degree any
thing which redounds to the credit
of the college. Let a student write
something which brings honor to
his college, whether in science or
literature, and there is no limit to
the recognition he receives from his
fellows. Let a football player strive
to win glory for himself instead of
for his college, and his fellows have
no use for him. What the critics
deem to be preference for the body
over the mind is in no small meas
ure preference for collective aims
over individual ones. It may be a
short sighted view of the matter to
think of the high stand man as
working for himself, and the athlete
as working for bis college. Yet it
is one which contains a large ele
ment of truth; and the honor paid
to college athletics is based on a
healthy recognition of this half
truth which critics so often over
look.
