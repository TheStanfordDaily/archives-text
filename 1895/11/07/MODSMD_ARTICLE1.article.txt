tomorrow afternoon. Every prep
aration has been made to insure its
success.
The following is the cast :
The Duke. . . Mr. Norval McGregor
Duke Frederick (his brother and
usurper of his dominions). . . .
Mr. George Olmi
Amiens Mr. 0. A. Deane
Jaques Mr. Jerome Sykes
(of the Bostonians)
l,e Beau (acourtier, attending upon
Frederick). . . Mr. Louis Butler

Sons of Sir Roland de Bois
Adam Mr. \V. L.Gleason
Touchstone(aclown) Percylltinting
Corin Mr. Warren Dibble
Sylvius Mr. Pietro Sosso
Shepherds
William (a country fellow, in love
with Audrey), (ieorge Godfrey
Rosalind (a daughter of the ban
ished Duke)
Miss Pauline French

Mi SS (ieorge Elliot
Phebe (a shepherdess )
Miss Freda Gallick
Audrey (a country wench)
Miss M. Nevada lleffron
Foresters Stanford Glee Club
Pages. . Misses Dane, Pence, Stewart
Lords, Ladies, Guards,
Attendants.
From the forgoing cast it can be
seen that each one of the partici
pants in "As You Like It" is an
actor who has made an enviable
reputation on the stage. Each
member of the company has been
selected for certain individual
merits. The organization is not
composed of a sin git' stock company,
but is an aggregation of the lead
ing actors now on the Coast.
Leo Cooper, the well-known San
Francisco dramatist and a man
who has established a name as a
skillful stage director, has had
charge of the rehearsals. Judging
by the opinions of experts who had
an opportunity of witnessing the
rehearsals we can certainly antici
pate a presentation which in point
of artistic finish will surpass the
one given at Sutro Heights. Prob
ably the one who a hove all others we
could consider the star of the com
pany is Mr. Jerome Sykes of the
Bostonian company, who plays the
part of Jaques. Although all the
members of the Bostonians are ot
such a high standard that it is dif
ficult to say that one is better than
another, still if any two take the
lead for strong a< ting, they are Mr.
Barn a bee and Mr. Sykes who alter
nate in the role of the Sheriff of
Nottingham in "Robin Hood."
Mr. Armstrong, who plays Or
lando, has won a wide reputation
not only here on the Coast but
throughout the East where he
travelled formally years in com
pany with Booth and Barrett. Miss
French, although not strictly a
professional, will doubtless interpret
Rosalind in a true and faeinating
way.

Taking it all in all the perform
ance will he of such merit that no
one can afford to miss it, especially
since opportunities of this nature
are seldom offered to the students
of Stanford University.
