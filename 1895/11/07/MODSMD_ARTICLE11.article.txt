At the opening of this University
it was the request of President
Jordan that there should he no
smoking in and around the Uni
versity buildings. In earlier days
this injunction was heeded. In
Hut a few cases did the offenders
have to he spoken to in person hy
the President before they desisted.
With the lapse of time, however,
and the advent of new classes, this
early restriction has been often dis
regarded. It can not be said that
the offending students are altogether
at fault. They have been following
the example in many cases of in
structors who have repeatedly
broken this rule, although they must
certainly have heard of its exist
ence.
We are not finding fault with
the man who becomes addicted to a
habit which necessitates the pol
lution of the air others must
breathe. We simply beg those
who are unfortunate enough to
have formed this habit to respect
the rights of others sufficiently to
restrain themselves where the prac
tice of their habit is forbidden.
In the older universities the de
sires of the founders and presidents
are always held in reverence. The
general freedom allowed here offers
no excuse for any lack of courtesy.
