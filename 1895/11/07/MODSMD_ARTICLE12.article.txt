It is high time that we awake to
tlie gravity of the football situation
here. Things are badly out of
joint. The old time football spirit
seems to have died out at Stanford.
The students ns a whole give the
players but little support and en
couragement, and many of the foot
hall men themselves have come to
consider their own petty grievances
of more importance than the wel
fare of the team.
Three weeks from today our
team will meet Berkeley's. Were
they to meet today no one doubts
that Berkeley would have a walk
over. The man is an idiot who
thinks we are going to win because
we are in the habit of winning. If
we are not to suffer overwhelming
defeat Thanksgiving day there
must be a great awakening of foot
hall spirit.
The most imperative need is a
strong second eleven and enough
extra men to draw upon to fill up
the ranks when men drop out dur
ing the practice. What can be
done while barely twenty-two men

appear on the field when the teams
first line up? Sixty suits are out,
yet only about twenty-five men are
playing. In the last week there
has been but one day of decent
work, simply because men could
not be found to play. This deplor
able state is apparently due to
several causes. Some of the men
are inclined to become offended if
they are not singled out from the
mass and treated as ready-made
heroes. Many more have become
discouraged after sitting at theside
lines through a few practices with
out being called out to play, and so
have quit appearing at all. This
tendency has been increased by the
fact that others have twitted these
men about the lack of appreciation
of their talents. Such a spirit is
suicidal. Men must be kept in
readiness on the side-lines. The
fellow who is the most faithful in
coming out when he is apparently
not needed and has no chance to
make the Varsity most deserves to
be honored. Some of our college
heroes have been men who never
hoped to make the team.
At Yale the extra men are
grouped at one side where they may
watch the play to good advantage
and be ready if needed. There is
no thought, either on their part or
on the part of the spectators, that
they deserve sneers for their faith
fulness. We must show that spirit
here if we hope to remedy in three
weeks the mistakes of the past.
