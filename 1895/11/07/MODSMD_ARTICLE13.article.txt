Fire destroyed the rotunda and
public hall at the University of
Virginia atCharlottestown Sunday.
The old rotunda stood as a monu
ment to Thomas Jefferson, the
founder of the university, and was
built after plans of his own. The
mayor telegraphed to neighboring
cities for assistance. Richmond,
Lynchburg, and Staunton re
sponded promptly. Under the su
pervision of Prof. Echols the corps
of students made strenuous en
deavors by the use of dynamite to
prevent the spread of the lire to the
rotunda. So massive was the struc
ture leading to the rotunda that the
dynamite made little impression.
On each side of the portico were
massive pillars of Italian marble,
which were carved in Italy at a
great cost for Mr. Jefferson. These
could not be overthrown. By this
time the tire had got beyond all
bounds, and leaped from the annex
to the rotunda. The firemen at
once directed their attention to this
building, as in it was the line li
brary of 63,000 volumes, many of
them extremely rare and valuable;
a life-size statue of Jefferson, and
a large number of magnificent por
traits and rare works of art. The
students succeeded in saving thou
sands of the books and some of the
paintings. Among the portraits
burned was that of Jefferson. The
statue of Jefferson, which is very
heavy, was dragged from the burn
ing building. Two-thirds of the
books and the magnificent paint
ing, "School of Athens," which cost
$40,000, were destroyed. The old
chapel and the reading-room, di
rectly connecting the main room
with the professors' and students'
rooms, were blown down with dyna
mite to arrest the progress of the
flames. The rotunda was that part
of the building completed in Mr.
Jefferson's day, and in which, in
1825, a, reception was held at
which Lafayette and other dis
tinguished men assisted. The loss
is estimated now at fully $200,-
000. The students have begun a
movement to secure funds to restore
the building. —Harvard Crimson.
