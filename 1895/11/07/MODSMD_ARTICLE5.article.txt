# SHORT BUT GOOD.
## Promise of Enthusiasm in the Grandstand. 
### 
The practice yesterday was cut
short for want of sufficient men. |
Nevertheless, while it did last, the!
work was of a superior quality.
Mr. Camp devoted some time to
coaching the men of the second |
eleven, and they showed marked'
improvement over their former!
playing.
The crowd on the bleachers j
showed far more enthusiasm than
usual. There was an absence ofj
that tendency to guy those who
had spirit enough to yell, and in!
consequence the cheering was bet-!
ter.
The team as a whole did very!
good work, but there are some of the !
old men who appear to be either
lazy or content to rest on the
laurels won in past years. These j
same men are capable of great
things if they would only exert
themselves.
The game started off in a rather
snappy manner last night, but still j
the men do not line up quickly]
enough. The fault does not seem i
to lie with the quarterback and j
centers but with two or three men
who loaf along instead of following
tlie ball and getting into their
places quickly.
Again last night the fault of
not nailing the runner after break
ing through the line was in evi
dence. The line men got through
well enough, but after they were
through they seemed all at sea and
failed to stop the runner and to
break up the interference.
Plate made an excellent run
around the end, and was neatly
tackled by Hen Thomas. Both of
these players showed up to good
advantage during the game.
Thomas, especially, proved himself
a very gritty player, both in tack
ling and running with the ball.
llarry Reynolds kept up his good
reputation as a ground-gainer, lie
made a number of long dashes,
which, as a rule, ended in touch
downs. lie was aided a great
deal by the interference of the
backs and ends. Jeffs, who has
proven himself the speediest end on
the iield, showed that he was equal
to some capital interference when
occasion demands. One of Rey
nolds' longest runs was made be
hind Jeffs' interference.
Campbell made a long gain, and
was pluckily tackled by Mcintosh,
who played all over the lield.
Weldon went through the line
for his distance repeatedly. lie is
showing great improvement in his
line-bucking.
Fisher made a good showing
again. He managed to be in every
scrimmage, and is apparently a
strong man.
The make-up of the teams was as
fol lows:
Jeffs 1 end r Bartlett
Campbell . . 1 tackle r James
Kickert ... .1 guard r. ..Harrington
