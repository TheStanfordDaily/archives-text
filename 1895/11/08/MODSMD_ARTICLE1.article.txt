# IN THE FOREST OF ARDEN.
## A 						Successful Production of Shakspere's Charming Comedy. 
### 
The weather today proved to be
most favorable for the lirst per
formance of a Shaksperean play at
Stanford. It was an ideal day for
such an out-door production, being
neither too warm or too chilly.
Over-head was the resplendence of
sun and sky, while all around the
meadows and foothills were draped
in their russet Autumn garb.
The play was presented in the
grove of trees to the north of Es
condite cottage. Up among the
poplars the blackbirds chirped
noisily while a few shy and dis
trustful robins liitted about the
tops of the fragrant pine trees. To
the left could be seen the cottage
with its quaint architecture that
evoked dreams of a bygone day
that was so different from the
present.
The audience was enclosed by
long rows of trees that seemed to
have been planted especially for
that purpose. The back of the
stage was formed by a row of large
pine trees, through the branches of
which could he seen glimpses of
lawn, across which flitted from
time to time men-at-arms, pages,
shepherds, and ladies in waiting.
There are many things to he
said of the advantage of studying
a play of Shakspere's upon the
stage. In the lirst place it should
always be born in mind thatShaks
pere was always, and above all
things, a playwright. lie wrote
[days with the prime intention of
suiting the people that patronized
the theaters in which his plays
were produced. Therefore his works
should always be considered as
plays and not as the closet-dramas
of such a writer as Browning. But
the performance of "As You Like
It" by no means afforded an op
portunity to forma correct estimate
of the fitness of the play for its pur
pose. The entire lirst two scenes of
the second act were omitted and
the third act was so changed as to
he almost unrecognizable. So that
the ensemble of the play as Shaks
pere intended it was marred.
Of the performers the most suc
cessful was Miss Pauline French,
who assumed the role of Rosalind.
She invested the part with a sim
plicity that was not tameness. She
infused the true spirit into the role;
the spirit of buoyant health, of joy
ous frolic, and sprightly adventure,
and she succeeded in sustaining it
throughout the performance. Never
once did she degenerate into mere
boisterousness, but was always
radiant with overflowing animal
spirits.
Mr. Frank Armstrong as Orlando
was a manly looking fellow. He
appeared to be just such a good
natured, healthy fellow as it does
one good to be with, happy and
contented, and envying no man his
possessions. He brought to the
part all its physical requirements,
and though he lacked insight into,
and appreciation of t : «• poetic side
of the character, yet he played at
all times with in < 11nestness and
sincerity that was commendable.
Mr. Jerome Sykes as Jaques
looked very self-ponsessed, portly,
and well-fed. and anything but

I melancholy, lie seemed to be un
j familiar with his lines, but gave a
quiet and satisfactory rendering of
the famous speech of the Seven Ages.
As Touchstone Mr. Percy Hunt
j ing was, perhaps, the least satis
factory of the players. Touchstone is
the blithest and merriest of all
Shakspere's fools. Yet, although
| he is always bubbling over with
I merriment, lie is no mere fool, but
I a man "full of wise saws and mod
ern instances." The subtleness of
; the character was overlooked by
the performer, and only those things
| that lie upon the surface were
i grasped. Yet he made Touchstone
sprightly and joyous and was at
j times si welcome figure upon the
i scene.
Oliver, in the hands of Mr. 11. E.
Humphrey, was altogether an inof
fensive young man. There was no
trace of the crafty and unscrupu
lous brother, as depicted by the
i author.
The Celia of Miss George Elliot
was intelligent, and in the main
! satisfactory, though at no time dis
j tinguished.
Miss M. Nevada Tfeffron made of
Audrey a country hoyden, but not
a hoyden of Shakspere's time.
With but one exception, that of
! Miss French, all of the performers
| seemed bent upon improving the
verse of Shakspere. They seemed
'to utter their own additions with
an inward chuckle and a smile of
self-satisfaction ami self-congratu
lation.
Amiens, in the hands of Mr. C.
A. Deane, was about as animated
as one of the stage logs that deco
orated the lawn and over which
the actors occasionally stumbled.
From the gestures with which he
accompanied the performance of
the exquisite lyric, "Blow, blow,
thou wintry wind," one would say
that his experience had been con
lined to singing in the ranks of the
Tivoli chorus. He seems to have
not the least ear for pitch, for he
i sang woefully off the key.
The members of the Stanford
Glee Club, for once, found them
selves attired in the costume in
which Robin llood and bis merry
men are said to have roved through
the glades of Sherwood. They sang
the first solo as though somewhat
! affected by stage-fright, but after
wards acquitted themselves with
honor. Between the scenes they
devoured the apples and bananas
that served for the Duke's "spread"
in the forest, and made lifty-yard
runs across the lawn behind the
stage that would put to shame any
member of the Varsity eleven.
Taking into consideration the
, circumstances under which the play
was given, the performance as a
whole was as satisfactory a one as
! could be expected. The most ser
ious defect was the inexcusable
mutilation of Shakspere's lines and
scenes, and this is probably to he
attributed to the manager. It
| can not be pleaded that the exi
gencies of the out-door setting
entailed any such tampering with
the play, for Modjeska with the
Booth and Barrett company gave
the play entire under similar cir
i cumstances.
The Stanford Orchestra furnished
the music for the occasion and won
the appreciation of the audience.
