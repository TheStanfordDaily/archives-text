The enthusiasm manifested on
the football field yesterday after
noon was extremely gratifying.
The increased attendance at the
practice, the generous applause of
good plays, and the energetic way
in which the yell was given, all
marked a great change from the
spirit previously shown. The atti
tude taken by the football men too
was entirely commendable. A
number of men were out at great
personal sacrifice for the sake of
the team. This is the spirit that
deserves the gratitude of the student
body.
The practice may not have been
first-class, but the life put into it
spoke volumes for the possibilities
that may be accomplished in three
weeks of such effort. We have great
odds to overcome, but if the general
enthusiasm can be kept at white
heat there is still hope of success.
The football men must continue to
come out regardless of individual
interests, and unquestioning obe
dience must be given io the coach.
Not another day should be lost to
effective practice. The crowd of
spectators must not be al
lowed to fall off either in numbers
or in enthusiasm. All "joshing"
should be frowned down; that
stopped all manifestations of col
lege spirit until yesterday, and will
again be the death of it if tolerated.
