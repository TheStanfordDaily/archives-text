# Pennsylvania's Dormitories
## 
### 
For the past hundred and fifty
years one of the highest ambitions
of the University of Pennsylvania
has been the possession of a com
plete system of dormitories.
Through the untiring and energetic
efforts of the present provost, (\ C.
Harrison, this ambition is about to
be realized. It is expected that, by
the opening of next year, enough
dormitories will be completed to
accommodate three hundred stu
dents. The system of buildings
consists of contiguous cottages of
moderate size, which, when com
pleted, will enclose a large quad
rangle, each separate building ac
commodating from twelve to four
teen students. The buildings will
be three stories high with windows
facing the street on one side and
the enclosure on the other. There
will be no communication between
the separate dormitories, entrance
to them being secured only from
the quadrangle. One of the prom
inent features of the plan is the
provision fora study with two
sleeping room sattached as a suite
for two students.
Towering above the other build
ings will be ;i chapel :in<l a dining
ha 11, each of which will undoubtedly
be the largest and best-ecjnipped j
building of its kind possessed by
any university. The dining-hall
will ha a seating capacity of six
hundred, while the chapel will ac
commodate about a thousand.
The total cost of the entire sys
tem will be $1,000,000, of which
$250,000 have already been se-1
cured. It is expected that the entire j
system will be finished within three
years.â€”Cornell Daily Sun.
