# LIKE OLD TIMES.
## They Were All There and They All Yelled. 
### 
All the college spirit andenthusi
j asm which has laid dormant for sol
; long here burst forth last night as J
| the ball left Overaeker's toe for the j
i lirst kick-off of the practice, and |
j the beauty of it was that the cheer-;
I ing did not cease. The old yell |
j was started from the grandstand, j
taken up by those on the side-lines'
land thrown back from across the |
gridiron by those on the other side, j
The natural effect of all this was
that the players did their best and
worked as though their lives de
pended upon it."And the band
| played on." The Band was in the
gymnasium and their playing
! did much to keep up the enthusi
| asm and to buoy the spirits of the
football men. It is to be hoped
that the Band will see lit to play at
each practice game from now on.
The music will serve as an extra
inducement to many to witness the
game and will add much eneour
| agement to the men of the chrys
anthemum bangs.
There was just one little thing to
! mar the almost perfect success of i
j the afternoon. Several members of |
. one of the lower classes so far for- 1
I got themselves as to hiss when the
| yell of another class was given.
There was no occasion for this as
| all class rivalry was buried in the
I common purpose of helping along
| the interest of the University as a
' whole.
The field was in first-rate con
dition and everything united to
make the practice what it should
j he.
At 4:80 there were twenty-seven i
canvas-clad men on the field and a!
quarter of an hour later there were
half as many more. Thus it was
possible to strengthen the second
I eleven from time to time, and in
| consequence the Varsity was con
jtinually pitted against a strong
i opposing team.

* !
Adams and Beedy, new men, j
were out for the first time and
though green made a fair showing.
Beedy downed Weldon in good i
stvleafter thelatterhad made a long
5 run.
Joe Bernhard, J. Mcintosh,
Bunker, and Brown, '96, were out j
to renew their acquaintance with
I the gridiron. Bunker made some!
'splendid tackles, and Bernhard was
not far behind him in his work.
Fisher again did some cleveri
I work, lie is learning quickly and
with his speed and strength should,
make a successful player.
I The star work of the day was

done by Jeffs. lie was every
where. He tackled, ran, and
bucked with equal skill,and should
give the Varsity ends a hard rub
for the position.
Of the linemen, C. Thomas did
the most tackling. Harrington
drew down the applause of the
crowd by the capital way in which
he broke through the line and
blocked a kick.
Harry Reynolds, Cochran, and
Weldon made some good runs; also
I£. Smith on the second eleven.
"Hilly" Mcintosh made a good
run on a catch and did some
excellent tackling.
Frazier's punting and line-buck
ing was exceedingly good. Chiefly
through the efforts of Jeffs and
Frazier the ball was carried down
to the Varsity's ten-yard line.
