Berkeley owes not a little of
her supremacy on the track to the
training of her athletes throughout
the year. By light work at regular
periods her track men are kept in
condition and make gradual im
provement with every month.
Everyone knows that men cannot
be kept in constant training, but
U. C. seems to have hit a happy
medium for keeping her athletes in
good condition without overtrain
ing them.
Stanford's trouble has been that
after the intercollegiate meet most
of the men drop athletics entirely
fora year and do not begin to pre
pare for the big field-day until a.
short time before it takes place. It
might be well for those in charge of
the track athletics here to insist on
enough training to gradually de
velop the ability of each man to
the fullest extent. There are a few
individual athletes who do this of
their own volition, but there are
many other good men who will
never do this until some one in
authority requires it.
