On another page will be found a
cm 11 fora meeting of the Associated
Students tomorrow night after the
lecture. A number of speeches will
be made and suggestions offered for
methods of organizing the Stanford
forces for the great game. This
meeting should partake much more
of the nature of a rousing mass
meeting than the average student
body meeting does. The chapel
will be crowded tomorrow night to
hear the most powerful friend in
America of colTege athletics lecture
on his favorite theme. The audi
ence will collect early. Football
songs should relieve the monotony
of the long wait. After the lecture
every one should remain and do
his part toward making the meet
ing of [the student body a memor
able one.
