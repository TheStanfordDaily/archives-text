Last Saturday two teams of the
"big four" were all but beaten and
one of them was actually tied by
teams from colleges which have
never before had any pretensions to
the football championship. Har
vard defeated Michigan by one
bare touch Mown; Princeton had the
same experience with Cornell; while
Brown scored on Yale for the first
time and made the game a tie.
The abolition of mass plays and
the revival of the kicking game has
had much to do with this change.
Until three years ago Yale, Har
vard, and Princeton were accus
tomed to roll up scores of seventy,
eighty, a hundred to nothing. To
be scored upon by a minor college
was almost a calamity. Penn
sylvania's victory over Princeton
in ISU2 was the first intimation of
change in the situation. In the
following year under the new rules
a half dozen teams scored against
each of the leaders, ami overwhelm
ing scores became unusual.
All this has improved the game
and widened its scope of usefulness.
The new rules have done more than
was really claimed for them. Un

fortunately they could not entirely
eliminate roughness. The players,
j not the rules, are responsible for
I the conduct of the game. They
| have, however, made skill and
; speed equal to weight and brute
, strength.
