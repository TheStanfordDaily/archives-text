Unless more men attend Band
practice during the coming week
that organization, which has proved
so great an attraction on each
Thanksgiuing, is to be dissolved.
The few men who are on hand for
every practice, giving up valuable
time to this student enterprise, can
not make it a success unaided. They
simply declare that they will not
give up all their time to Band
practice when there are dozens of
good musicians here who do not
care enough for their college to put
in an appearance at the necessary
meetings for practice. As usual,
the very students who have given
it the time it requires, are the very
ones whose University work is the
heaviest. If these men can give
three or four hours a week to aid a
Stanford enterprise, surely the rest
can not decline on the ground of
lack of time.
There are half a hundred men at
tending tiii-- college who are well
able io play in the Band: let each
one of these men sacrifice enough of
his spare time to make it what it
ought to be.
Next to the Varsity eleven itself
there is no other student organiza
tion that attracts such attention on
Thanksgiving day as the Stanford
Ba nd.
Berkeley has gotten together a
band of about twenty pieces; is
Stanford going to publicly acknowl
edge that she hasn't the enterprise
to send up a band of twice that
number? We must not harbor
such an idea fora minute. A lit
tle enthusiasm and a little self
sacrifice on the part of certain stu
dents will give Stanford a band to
be proud of and U. C. will be ex
celled once more by our musicians.
Let every man who can play one
instrument get out for practice and
prevent the dismemberment of our
Band.
