# The 						Sunday Sermon.

### 
The Sunday sermon was preached
by Rev. Dr. Briggs of San Jose on
the subject, "Love, the supreme re
demptive agency from sin." He
said:
"Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God with all thy heart." These
words were the answer to a lawyer's
question as to which is the greatest
of all the laws, to which lie added
the next greatest, "Thou shalt love
thy neighbor as thyself."
A reading of Christ's life shows
that he was himself the best ex
emplification of his own teachings.
He was constantly teaching this
message of love. I he religion of
society had fallen into a deplorable
state. The Scribes and Pharisees
had followed their own writings
between the lines of Scripture, and
strangely enough had attached
more importance to these inter
lineations than to the words of
God. Christ found the church
consequently under a great burden
of ceremonies and forms. But with
one little, mighty word, love, Jesus
showed the way out of the bondage
of ceremony and legalism into the
realm of life —that love fulfills all
the law.
People today are continually
taking some text of Scripture en
tirely away from its connection
and putting upon it the thumb
screw of their own opinion, and
calling that Christianity. So that
if anyone tries sincerely to think
and act for himself he is open to
the charge of heresy. But creeds
are human and do not deserve to
be worshipped; and we are glad to
see in the church a constantly les
sening tendency to deify them.
However, there are yet not a few
who sit down in their little, cramped
enclosure and say, "This is the
apostolic church," and think there
is no entrance into Heaven except
through their gate.
It is a great thing to be an
American, but it is a greater thing
to be a man. I am a Methodist,
but I would not have all my fellow
men be Methodists. I naturally

think it a great tiling to be a
Methodist, but it is :i greater tiling
to be ii Christian. If my Catholic
brother finds hope in purgatory, or
if my Calvinist brother finds com
fort in his belief in predestination,
I would not rob either of them of
his hope. We should remember
that into Ilis Church Christ has
put just two essentials, love of God
and love of man, and that further
than these there can be no binding
law. Nor should any man, if he
be trying to follow the teachings of
Christ, be excluded from Christ's
Church simply because he denies
some of these other unessential be
liefs. Orthodoxy saves no man.
The peculiar privilege of Christ's
life was his ability to preach, for |
the first time, that love is the su
preme redemptive agency from sin.
He found sin a recognized fact.
Some people say that sin is a, fact
of theology. As a matter of fact, no
man need ask his neighbor what
sin is; it is a fact of universal hu
man experience. Where is the man
who does not feel the leprosy of sin
in his own palm ? The Pharisees
were trying to get rid of sin by
means of ceremonies and forms.
But Christ told them that while
these remedies might restrain, they
could never eradicate it; but that
love is the supreme redemptive
agency from sin.
The man who obeys merely
through fear never becomes really
much better. If you can instill
into a boy the principle of love you
have saved him; and the principle
that will save one bad boy will save
a bad race.
I-have seen persons whose whole
lives seemed to be changed after
joining church, and yet 1 felt that
they were not essentially changed.
One man of'my acquaintance al
ways attended church, and all fu
nerals, but he sat with a face as
hard as flint. His conduct was gov
erned by a sense of duty, not by
love.
What should be the measure of
this love ? Jesus says thou shalt
love the Lord with all thy heart;
and this means service with all thy
life. A mother, before departing, re
quests her little girl to start the
fire and begin some preparations
for tea before her return. But the
little girl, seeing the weeds in the
garden, and remembering that it is
her duty to pull the weeds, and be
ing specially invited thither by the
pleasing sun and fragrant flowers,
spends all her time weeding the
garden. The mother returning, de
mands an excuse for the disobe
dience. Can the little girl furnish
! this excuse by relating how invit
ing was the garden, and by remind
ing her mother that it was her
I standing duty to keep the garden
free from weeds, and by presenting
her mother with a beautiful boquet
which she has picked and brought
for her ? The little girl has served
her mother with almost, but not
quite all, of her heart. Love, meas
ured by our whole heart, is the su
preme redemptive agency from our
I sin.
