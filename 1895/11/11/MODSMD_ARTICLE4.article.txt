# BERKELEY VS. OLYMPICS.
## The
						University Boys Win From the Athletic Club Team. 
### 
Nearly a thousand people as-j
sembled at Central Park on Satur
day, to see the U. C. eleven defeat j
the Olympic team by the score of
20 to 0.
The game was characterized by
numerous fumbles, the snappy work
of Berkeley, and liansome's fine
running and punting.
As yet it is impossible to make a
comparison between tlie Stanford
and IJ. C. teams, as the games in
which these two teams have met
Olympic were played under entirely
different conditions. As it now
stands, the difference in team work
is in Berkeley's favor. But in foot
ball, rival teams can never be ac
curately compared until they have
faced each other, and the last two
weeks of practice often makes great
changes in the work of a team.
It took (J. C. ten minutes longer
to make the first touchdown than it
did Stanford. U. C. made as good
a showing in the second half, but I
this was partly due to the substi
tution of fresh halfbacks.
At the commencement of play
Olympic kicked off for thirty-five
yards. U. C. ran the ball back ten
yards and, by a series of runs, car
ried the ball well into Olympic ter
ritory. Olympic then gained the
ball on downs, and gained seven
yards through the line. On the next
down the ball was fumbled, and
U. C. captured it.
U. C. tried line-bucking tactics
with indifferent success, and the
ball became the property of the
Athletic Club men.
After gaining considerable ground
Olympic again fumbled and Berke
ley captured it, and by numerous
short gains shortened the distance
between their line and Olympic's
goal. Olympic put a stop to further
advance and took the ball on
downs, but immediately lost it by a
! bad fumble.
By a series of fast plays the ball
' was carried to within two yards of
I the Olympic goal. Ransome took
the ball and was forced through
; Smith's position fora touchdown.
: Ransome kicked the goal. Score,
! G-0.
On the catch from kick-off Ran
some gained twenty yards, but im
mediately lost the same distance by
1 a poor pass. Ransome punted fora
! long gain. Morse muffed and
j Hutchinson secured the ball.
| Hutchinson was given the ball,
! and touched it down behind Olym
-1 pic's goal after a run of fifty yards
behind excellent interference. No
! goal. Score, 10-0.
This ended the scoring for the
first half, and time was called with
the ball in Berkeley's possession.
Ransome kicked off at the begin
| ning of the second half, and the
ball was carried back and forth for
I several moments until one of Ran
, some's punts landed it on Olym
-1 pic's eight-yard line.
Thierhauf gained five yards, but
lost the pig-skin by a fumble. On
j the next two downs Berkeley made
j no gain, but on the third Ransome
went around the end for five and
1 then through the line for five more,
thus placing the ball one yard from
the Olympic goal. Hall carried the
' ball over, and a successful try-at

goal added six points to Berkeley's
score.
The fourth touchdown was made
in a manner similar to the preced
ing one. Hall carried the ball
across the line, but Ransome missed
the goal. Score for game, 20-0.
A noticeable feature of Ransome's
punting was that he stood a great
distance from the line. This tended
to destroy the accuracy of the quar
terback's passes, but at the same
time did away almost entirely
with all likelihood of the kicks be
ing blocked.
