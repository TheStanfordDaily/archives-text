Next Saturday the football teams
of two large preparatory schools
located in this vicinity will prob
ably play the deciding game of a
series on our campus. It is im
portant that we turn out and give
the "preps" a rousing greeting.
Much of our athletic material has
in the past been drawn from one or
the other of these schools. The
University of California has been
making strong efforts to draw off
their promising athletes. A great
deal depends, therefore, in making
pleasant the stay of our visitors.
Let them feel that they are welcome,
whether or no they choose to be
with us in the future.
