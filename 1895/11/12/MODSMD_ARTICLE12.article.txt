The fact that Berkeley feels con
fident of defeating Stanford this
year should not discourage the
players here. The University of
California is generally confident
until the ball is kicked off in the
Thanksgiving match, when their ex
ultation and conlidence generally
suffer a pitiful collapse. The mere
fact that our rivals feel unusually
exuberant this season is nothing
specially alarming; there seems to
be something in the atmosphere
about the classic environments at
Berkeley which breeds disastrous
confidence as malaria is bred. The
U. C. coach has helped increase
this feeling of felicity; he doubt
less expects that Stanford will
will be overwhelmed with wasting
anxiety and dread.
A lot of hard work coupled with
the right sort of spirit and plenty
of men out for regular practice, may
we trust prove a panacea for U. C.'s
confidence.
