It is a matter of congratulation
that the imbroglio between the
Executive Committee and the
managers of the vaudeville to be
tfiven in San Francisco Thanksgiv
ing night has been amicably set
tled and that after all the latter en
tertainment will be possible. There
may be differences of opinion as to
the merits of the two sides of the
controversy, but there can be but
one view of the desirability of a
purely Stanford entertainment on
the night following the big game.
If the strict exercise of the power
claimed by the Executive Com
mittee meant the abandonment of
this entertainment, it is well that a
more conciliatory position was
taken. However, the sentiment of
the student body was with the com -
mittee on the justness of its claim,

if not on the expediency of it.
Hereafter action should he taken
early enough to he expedient as
well as just.
