The leniency which has heen in
vogue here in the past in regard to
the imposing of examinations
seems to have heen departed from
lÂ»y several professors of the Univer
sity in their courses this semester.
It is safe to say that there are
several courses in which thestudents
have already been given from two
to three examinations, and before
the semester is ended that number
stands in great danger of being ex
panded out of all due proportion to
the amount of work accomplished
during that time.
It is not the intention to decry
examinations. None are more con
scious of their value and usefulness,
especially in lecture courses, than
the students themselves, hut the ob
jection is made to the number that
are crowded upon them by some
professors in utter disregard of the
work they are carrying in other
courses. Examinations are the
only way many professors have of
ascertaining the amount of work
done by each student, but for the
ascertainment of this same it is not
just that one be afflicted with an
excessive number. In public and
in private schools it is necessary to
impose an examination in order
that the scholars may do their
work properly, but in a university
things are different. Most of the
students come here to work and to
learn, and, understanding the
value of an education, will perfect
themselves in their courses without
the aid of needless examinations.
