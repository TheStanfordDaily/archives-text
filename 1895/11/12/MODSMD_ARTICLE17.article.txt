# Olympic Games Revival
## 
### 
It is estimated that the Olympic
fund raised iti Greece to meet the
expense of the revival of the Olym
pic games next April at Athens will
reach 1,000,000 drachmae or $193,-
000, besides 000,000 drachmae given
l>y a Greek merchant of Alexandria,
named Averoff, for the purpose of
rebuilding the Panathenaic Sta
dium The crown prince and his
brothers are deeply interested in
the enterprise. The king having
promised to award in person the
prizes of silver olive wreaths, and
the government will issue special
commemorative postage stamps, a
part of the proceeds of which will
go to the (Mympic fund. Only a part
of the Stadion will be finished in
marble in time for next spring's
sports, the remainder being done in
wood, but Mr. Averoff intends to
have t he entire structure, which will
be capable of seating 70,000 specta
tors, ultimately constructed in Pen
telic marble at his own expense. Its
sides slope up to a height of from
00 to 80 feet, and the interior space,
in the form of a horseshoe, is 070
feet long by 109 feet wide. It forms
a natural hollow between two of
the lowest spurs of Mt. Ilymettus,
and from it can be had a splendid
view of Athens and the surround
ing country, including the Bay of
Salamis.
The foot races and gymnastic
contests will take place in the
Stadion, and here will be finished
the twenty-six mile race from Mar
athon in memory of the runner
who died in his effort to bring to
Athens the news of the Persian de
feat. The bicycle races will be
contested on the Phaleric plan half
way between the city and the sea
shore, the swimming and rowing
races in the roadstead of Phaleron,
and the yacht races in the Saronic
Gulf. There is to be an illumina
tion of the great monuments of
antiquity, a grand historical torch
light procession representing scenes
from Greek history, and a series of
representations of dramatic master
pieces, beginning with a tragedy by
Sophocles and ending with Wag
ner's Lohengrin," and a special
Olympic hymn by a modern Greek
composer is to be sung by a mon
ster ehorous. A great attendance
of athletes and scholars from all
the world is expected. —Harvard
