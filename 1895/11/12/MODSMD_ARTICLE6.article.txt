# LAST NIGHT'S PRACTICE
## 
### 
The Play Rather Slow, but Watched
by a Large Crowd.
The teams lined up early last
evening on a Held which was in
almost perfect condition, it had
been sprinkled in the morning and
harrowed in the afternoon.
There was a big crowd in attend
ance, but the enthusiasm of hist
week seemed to have died down and
the yelling was left to a few enthusi
astic ''rooters." These men did
their best to arouse the crowd, but
with indifferent success.
The play was very slow, too slow
indeed. Berkeley evidently "has it
on us" in this respect. The U. C.
team play a quick, snappy game,
and that is going to count in the
end. Jf our line-men would brace
up and stiffen the line as a whole
it would go a long way towards
enabling the backs to put ginger
into their work.
The practice started off with
a punting contest between the full
backs, Frazier and W'eldon. As
long as this continued the ball was
kept in the Varsity's lot, but when j
running tactics were resorted to the |
hall was carried down the lield and i
soon crossed the Scrubs goal line. \
In punting it was nip and tuck be- 1
tween the two fullbacks. Both
covered about the same distance in
their kicks, but W'eldon was a little
surer than Frazier.
The star play of the day was
Spalding's long run and touch
down. It was as tine a piece of
work as has been seen on the field
this year, lie caught the ball on
the second eleven's twenty-five yard
line and, charging into a bunched
field, dodged tackier after tackier
and made a touchdown.
C. Thomas outplayed his vis-a
vis at guard. He broke through re
peatedly and kept his man guess
ing. Fickert also played a good
| guard, lie followed the ball in
j great style.
Rice and Mcintosh made some
excellent tackles for the second
eleven. The former followed the
ball better than any of the other
tackles.
Leavitt managed to get the ball
out of a scrimmage and made a
good run, but was downed by W'el
don.
Cotton was given a try-at-quar-
I ter, and played a pretty strong
game in that position. His weight
would add much to the defense of
the line if he could lie worked up
to a proper knowledge of the quar
terback's duties.
