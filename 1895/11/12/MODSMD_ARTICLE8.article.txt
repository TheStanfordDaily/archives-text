here, but was granted a fellowship
in Latin in Yale for 1893-94, and

The Hustler of Yanderbilt Uni
versity said of him :
Yanderbilt has lost another
valued instructor. At noon Satur
day Mr. E. E. Bradshaw, instructor
in Latin, died at the residence of
Mrs. Wall on Belmont avenue,
after a brief illness with typho
nialarial fever. His death is per
culiarly sad. Always an earnest
student, he had spent his whole life
in the acquirement of knowledge.
And now he has been cut down in
the prime of his young manhood,
just as he had begun to reap the
reward of his patient and unremit
l ting toil, and to win for himself the
recognition his attainments merited.
lie took his M. A. degree at Yan
derbilt several years ago, and after
ward pursued his studies first at
! Leland Stanford Junior University
and then at Yale. A little over a
year ago he returned to Yanderbilt
as instructor in Latin, and in his
work here proved himself a master
of his subject and a thorough and
conscientious teacher. II is place
will be hard to fill. His wife and
infant child have the deepest sym
pathy of the entire university com
munity in their great affliction.
