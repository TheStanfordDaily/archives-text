# STANFORD ENTHUSIASM.
## The 						Mass Meeting A Great Success— Features of the Evening Outlined. 
### 
Stanford enthusiasm has at last
manifested itself. According to the ,
plan of the Executive Committee,
Walter Camp's lecture was followed |
by a student body mass meeting,
j>resided over by President Sheldon, |
who said in taking the chair: "1
presume you all know the object of j
the meeting. We have met to raise
enthusiasm for the game with our
rivals across the bay. We feel,
that there is a great responsibility j
resting upon us here; four times!
the cardinal has gone against the;
blue and gold and has never yet
been vanquished; we want to keep
it there in its proud position. There
is no university which has won
greater success than Yale, and it
has been because of the Yale spirit;
the student body has upheld her
representatives in everything. We
can have a spirit which no uni
versity can surpass, and it is for
that purpose that we are here this
evening. 1 therefore have the
pleasure of introducing to you
the man most interested in the big
game— Dr. Jordan."
When tin; cheering had subsided
Dr. .Jordan said: "It is pretty
hard to tell what to say (the Stan
ford yell and applause); especially
when one has his conversation
punctuated in a way he is not used
to having it punctuated. 1 had
begun to feel that it was the other
fellow's time to win; that we had
won every other time, and as this
was the winter of our discontent
we could afford to. let the other fel
lows win. Hut Professor Camp is
with us again and the banner he
carries has never yet been trailed
in the dust; and it would not he a
good thing for him to carry a de
feat back to Yale with him; so out
of consideration to him, I have be
gun to feel different. Then there
are some new men who have never
played on the team before and who
have never won a game; it would
not be fair for these men to lose
their tirst game.
"Then, again, there are also some
old players who have never lost a
game and, of course, they do not
want to have their records broken.
"We have another duty. It is
one of the functions of this Uni
versity to keep the University of
California in the line of its greatest
ideal; now, it would not he right
for the University of California to
win until they have an ideal team
made up of invincible men. It is,
therefore, for their good as well as
for the good of the great State of
California to hold them away from
victory again."
President Sheldon then called
upon Captain Cochran, who spoke
as follows:
"What we need is your sym
pathy; the side-lines for> a time
were more discouraging than our
own play. The prospects begin to
look a little better, and with the
enthusiasm of the side-lines, we do
not see why we should not beat
Berkeley."'
Dr. Ross was then introduced as
"the most enthusiastic advocate of
football in the University." He
said: "I have had the same diffi

culty which Dr. Jordan had. Back |
a few months ;ig<> some one said t»>
me that we ought to let Berkeley!
have this game, because if we did
not they would become discouraged.
I decided we ought to let them win
this time. But now I have changed
my opinion. Next year is soon
enough for them, and when next
year comes 1 shall say the same.
"We must not give up this game
until the sound of the hammer and
saw are once more heard on the
Stanford grounds. We want to con
vince our California friends that
the men of Stanford are perfectly
sure that there will be classes and
men here in the twentieth century
to carry the football across the line.
" If we wait until we have a
better coach or captain, or a better
manager than we have now, Ave
shall have to wait until the twenty
first century. If there is one thing
which the men need from us it is
the heart; for we must remember
from now on, that a large part of
the winning of the game rests upon
us. If the men make a good play,
we must cheer them; we must im
press upon the minds of the men
the idea of a great body of people
watching every play."
President Sheldon: "We want to
get all the light we can on thisques
tion, and there is one man here
who can give us more light than
any other man in the l. nited States.
I will therefore ask Mr. Camp to
again speak to us upon this sub
ject."
Walter Camp said: "1 think I
have bored you about enough in
talking football, but I am only too
glad to state just what it is that
the team needs from the Univer
sity. They need all the cheering
you can give them upon the field,
and they need all the private con
versation you can give them off the
field. Particularly in the matter of
the second eleven in the way of en
couragement to come out. The
prime need of a University team is
plenty of material to draw from; it
means not the victory of one year,
but the victory of other years. If
the University can put into the
first eleven the same snap that you
put into your cheers, I think we
will stand a chance."
President Sheldon then called
upon Professor Barnes, who re
sponded as follows: " I have been
thinking as I sat here that the one
thing that is greater than every
thing else in the world is public
sentiment. During the past weeks
L have been away throughout the
state meeting many people, and
have been glad that the name of
Stanford is a name that you can
conjure with anywhere. This is not
because these people know what
kind of courses we are giving here,
but.it is because we have been able to
take hold of them and fire them
with the idea that there is some
thing here worth while. Every
thing we do comes through our be
lief in it; and if we do not win this
game it is because the student
body does not believe we are going
to win the game."
