There was a decided chill in the
air last evening, which seemed to
sett le down over the side-lines and
which caused a perceptible coolness
in the enthusiasm of the spectators.
The cold weather tended to ginger
up the players, though, and they
worked like majors. The play was
considerably faster than heretofore
and each man played his best.
There was considerable fumbling
on both sides but this can un
doubtedly be attributed to the fact
that the centers and quarters were
not used to each other's style of
play.
Carle was put back at center and
although uncertain in snapping
the ball, he played a strong game
and was too much for his oppon
ent.
Lewers was tried at tackle and
did some good work, which gives
promise of improvement as he mas
ters the duties of the position.
Cotton was tried at quarter again
fora part of the game. He was
not at all sure of the pass but, as
said before, this was probably on
account of the change in centers.
Reynolds, Frankenheimer, and
Spalding made some excellent
runs. Harry Walton coached the
backs and urged them to their best
work.
Rice and Robinson on the second
team played well. Rice managed
to be in every scrimmage.
Harry Reynolds and Frazier
backed the line repeatedly for good
gains. Mcintosh made a touch
down for the second eleven but it
was not allowed on account of an
off-side play.
in the last fifteen minutes of
play, the second eleven was in
creased to thirteen men, but the
Varsity put up a stiff line and
held their more numerous oppon
ents down in good shape.
