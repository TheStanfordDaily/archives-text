# THE 						FATHER OF FOOTBALL.
## Walter Camp Discusses the Development of the Rules. 
### 
When Walter Camp entered the
chapel last evening he was greeted
with a rousing Yale cheer from
seven hundred throats. Dr. .Jor
dan introduced our coach and
said: "This is Professor Camp's
night." "I hope Thanksgiving
will be your day,"was Camp's quick
response, with a bow to the audi- j
ence.
Mr. Camp spoke in part as follows:
A few years ago Professor Sumner
of Yale took up bicycle riding; his
wheel was what was known as the
high machine, and he became very
adept in the use of it. But one
day betook that inevitable thing —
a header; and a friend meeting him
said, "Well, have you the football
disease too?" "No," replied tiie
professor, "J have only the symp
toms, not the disease." 1 think
that judging l'roni your attendance
at the football lield, most of you
have the disease.
It is said that Cato whenever lie
had made a speach ended it with
these words: "And in my opinion
Carthage should be destroyed."
Some people came to the same con
clusion in regard to our game of
football. And so the changes
which have been made in the foot
ball rules during the last two years
have been made in the attempt to
make the game above reproach.
First, in regard to the fair catch,
the individual looked so helpless
when about to make a fair catch
that the rules committee made the
rule that he must hold up his hand
when intending to catch the ball,
and in that way keep the others off.
Passing to the third and fourth
rules, we find the addition of a
linesman to prevent foul play by
either bide, and the additional pro
vision, that none but the players
and these officials be allowed 011
the field during the game. This
was to provide against what had
come to be a nuisance. In the old
times whenever a man was hurt a
crowd of men from both sides
flocked on the field with buckets of
water, sponges, etc.; now only two
men can go upon the field. Not
only the public, but also the players
will be grateful for this.
There is a great deal to be said
I about training. The coach endeav-
I ors to get the men in good physical
condition, yet teams are at times
j the most exasperating to deal with.
Another rule is that whenever a
j kick is made it must be made with
j vigor. In the case of a real mis
hap to a player, if he cannot within
j three minutes resume play he had
i better be removed.
In rule thirteen we had the
question of mass plays. The com
mittee received many letters on
this point and in response made
the rule that not more than three
men should start with the ball. So
much for last year's changes.
This year there are two sets of
rules, very much like the doctor
who applied his salve to a dog,
whose tail had been cut off, with
the result that a new tail grew out;
he then applied the salve to the
stump of the tail and a new dog
grew out. Without going into the
special changes, it is enough to say

tli.it both sets allow a man to put
the ball in play by touching it
down.
In regard to injuries to players,
the great trouble is that the most
men are hurt in the practice games;
yet we take all possible care of our
men in playing practice games. If
a man is not a candidate for the
Varsity, it will be hard to get him
out,again after an injury.
1 want to say to all of you who
contemplate taking up football,
that your chances of survival are
somewhat better than were those of
the patients of a physician, who as
sured some one afflicted with a cer
tain disease that one per cent, of all
persons having that disease would
recover; "therefore, you are bound
to recover," said he. ''But why are
you so sure?" asked the patient.
"Because," replied the doctor, £ \l
have treated ninety-nine patients,
and they have all died, so you are
bound to be the one to recover."
I cannot praise too highly the
men who play 011 the second eleven.
It is the second eleven that estab
lishes the character of the first, and
they determine the fitness of those
who are to play.
The last two years have found
many changes in all particulars.
We had overrun the time of prep
aration until some teams spent
the whole summer in practice in
order to be in training for the fall
games. The tendency is now to
wards restriction.
I am not sure that I can impress
upon your new University the true
idea of athletic spirit: to get the
most out of all your athletic men.
It makes no difference who wins,
because even if you lose, your men
have bad a development and a
training which is worth more than
a victory would be. There must
be a loser and you should be the
loser your share of the time.
I saw the Cambridge games in
New York, and from the time the
Englishmen landed there was the
utmost feeling of good will among
all the men; and when for the last
time the} 7 sat down to the table
together, you could not tell which
was the victor and which was the
vanquished.
