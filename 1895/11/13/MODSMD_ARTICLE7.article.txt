The Freshman Class is showing
a spirit worthy of the University in
their determination to give a Fresh
man Oilee this year. Such an in
novation has been agitated for some
time and the action of the Class of
'99 in carrying the idea into effect
forms an agreeable contrast to
that of the previous Freshman
classes. The function has not
been held here, nor is there any
way by which we can judge of its
merits in the line of former enter
tainments of its kind; but it is
safe to say that if the preparations
are carried out with the same care
and attention that are bestowed on
other similar occasions, it will but
add another to the already long
list of Stanford entertainments.
