There is not a little disappoint
ment manifested at the time set by
the Supreme Court for the hearing
of the Stanford case. It was hoped
here that the case might come up
for trial in time to be decided be
fore the Christmas vacation. It
would be hard to think of a more
acceptable Christmas gift for Stan
ford students than a favorable de
cision in this long-contested case.
It only remains for us to make
the best of the existing state of af
fairs and await the result with
patience. We all have great faith
in the things the future has in
store for Stanford. Wehave waited
long for the settlement of the suit
and we can wait a month or two
longer if we must.
The case is put upon the docket
to come up for the lirst Monday in
•January. The decision will likely
be reached and announced before
that month ends. If we win—and
there can be but little doubt as to
the result —we should be prepared
to celebrate on a scale which shall
forever overshadow every other
celebration of whatever character
in Stanford University.

Tiieke never has been such a
football meeting at Stanford as the
one held last night in the chapel.
The large audience attracted by
Walter Camp's lecture, remained
almost to the man for the student
body meeting. Even those who
had been standing crowded about
the doors throughout the lecture
held their ground till the last speech
was made. And those speeches —
any one who had before imagined
that Stanford lacks wit and elo
quence must have been convinced
of his mistake.
Yet it must not be forgotten that
a few hours before, while the foot
ball men themselves were "saying
nothing and playing ball," the
bleachers were nearly empty and
the few shivering spectators could
scarcely be induced to give the yell.
Of course the cutting wind was
largely .responsible for the apathy,
but if even a small part of the
spirit shown last night was real and
not a temporary impulse, neither
wind nor rain nor anything else
will be able to keep the grandstand
empty or prevent the crowd from
yelling.
It. remains to be seen whether
last night's enthusiasm was a
species of intoxication that has
already been slept off, leaving us
with only swelled heads to remind
us of it, or whether it was a mani
festation of a deep, strong feeling
of loyalty that has been hidden
beneath calm, indifferent exter
iors and which, now that what is
necessary is known, will not be
found lacking.
