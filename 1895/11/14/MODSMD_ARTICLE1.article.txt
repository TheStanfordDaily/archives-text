# LONG RUNS IN ORDER.
## Encouraging Work on the Gridiron Last Night. 
### 
It seemed impossible for the
second team to prevent their adver
saries from making long'runs hist
night. With few exceptions the
Varsity made inroads into the
territory of the Scrubs on every
end run. The ends failed to nail
the men and all of the tackling
was done by the center and tackles.
The benefit of having a leader for
the cheering was shown by the im
provement in the yelling of the
bleachers. Under the leadership
of "High Chief Rooter" Gregory,
the bleacher contingent did some
good systematic work. The yells
were given in unison and so
thoroughly in time that it seemed
like the cheer of a giant. But on
the other side of the Held there was
a death-like hush.
The play was fairly fast —in fact
it was as fast as could be expected
considering the fact that the Scrub
backs broke through the line at
will. There are only two places
in the Varsity line where it is im
possible for the men behind the
second team's line to go through.
They are between left guard and
center, and left guard and tackle.
The Varsity ends got down the
field on the punts in excellent style.
This has been their weak point and
it is to be hoped that last night's
work was a sign that they are about
to remedy this fault.
Jack Reynolds made a splendid
run, dodging several would-be
taeklers and shaking off those who
were lucky enough to get their
hands on him.
Cochran, Spalding, and Harry
Reynolds also scored good gains by
their sprinting ability. Cochran's
punting carried the pig-skin up the
field for good distances at nearly
every try.
Code, while he played end, made
some clean-cut tackles. Thomas
played Fickert's position, while the
latter coached the center men, and
did some very fair work.
James is fast earning recognition
as a good tackle. He plays his
hardest at all times,and repeatedly
breaks up his opponent's plays be
hind the line, hewers, fora center
man, did a great deal of tackling.
He caught several runners from be
hind after they had been missed by
those whose duty it was to nail
them.
