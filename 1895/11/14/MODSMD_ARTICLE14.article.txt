The Freshman Glee promises to
lÂ»e a brilliant feature in our social
life. It has two points in its favor:
it is an Innovation, and it comes
early in the season before the rush
of festivities exhausts the brains,
bodies, and purses. It is to be
hoped that the inauguration of
this event will be a great success,
and bring credit to the Class of '99.
