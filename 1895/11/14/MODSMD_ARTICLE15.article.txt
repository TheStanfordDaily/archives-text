at hand. In our absorption in
each day's task and pleasure we
are apt to forget that a day of
reckoning will come when we
shall stand before the bar of
the Registrar and answer for
all the studies for which we reg
istered in our innocent pride.
If we would receive recompense for
our toil, we should begin to write
up sundry "procrastinated" themes
and theses so that, when that time
comes, we will receive credit for
our works, and be presented, as
a mark of the Registrar's esteem,
with six or seven scarlet -f-'s.
