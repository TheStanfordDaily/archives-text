The spectators at each evening's
football practice lately have shown
the right spirit in cheering good
players and applauding individual
work. A great deal can he done
towards increasing the efficiency of
the men by letting them know that
each of their plays is observed
and that their personal efforts are
appreciated; but indiscriminate
yelling for every scrimmage does
little good, and a "josh," no mat
ter how well meant, is harmful.
Discretion should be exercised in
cheering as in all other matters.
The game may be greatly enlivened

thereby, while at the same time the
students are trained for concen
trated yelling on the day of the big
match.
Every student who has the col
lege interest at heart should turn
out at practice games each evening
now as regularly as do the players
themselves. In no other way can
they and the team do much,and in
no other way can they so efficiently
learn to give the college yell in un
ison as it should he given.
