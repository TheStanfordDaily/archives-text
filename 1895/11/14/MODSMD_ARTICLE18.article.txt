It is gratifying that in our per
iod of uncertainty letters have
come from all over the United
States, containing words of encour
agement concerning the suit. Even
remote individuals have sent
kindly messages of hope. Every
one seems to feel an absorbing
interest in the termination of the
Stanford law suit and a terror lest
the University of the setting sun
shall come to an untimely end.
While the opinion of the majority
does not influence the law, we can
not but feel intense gratitude and
pleasure at the sympathetic kind
ness manifested by our far-away
friends.
