In some of the larger classes,
where the students are not called
upon daily to recite, there springs
up a strange hesitancy to speak
when a class question does arise.
The professor although he prefers
to spend the most of his time
in lecturing, finds it discourag
ing, when he does ask something, to
be met with an appalling silence
savoring of stupidity. He begins
to feel that his lectures have para
lyzed the intellects, unfitting them
for class work. The students in
such cases often know perfectly the
answer, but not being used to
speaking in a lecture class, hes
itate about breaking the silence
and drawing all the attention to
themselves. This seems to be false
modesty, for it hampers the pro
gress of the class and gives the pro
fessor in charge a false impression.
