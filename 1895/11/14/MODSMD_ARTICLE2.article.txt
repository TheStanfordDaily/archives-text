# Reliance 8, Butte 6.
## 
### 
Reliance won the final match of
her Northern trip yesterday in a
hard-fought game with the Butte,
Mont., team. The Oakland team

will return with a clean record of
victories, but the escape from defeat l
yesterday was so narrow that its)
supremacy over Butte will remain
an open question.
Reliance kicked off, and in less
than five minutes (iillis, Butte's j
right half, made a touchdown after i
a brilliant run of sixty-five yards.
King kicked the goal. Securing the
ball soon after the next kick-off, i
Reliance played a rushing game'
111111 Butte could not withstand, and j
after a fumble by McMillan and
another by Brooks of Butte, Mc-
Millan secured (lie ball and made
a touchdown from the twenty-yard
line. Oliver missed the goal.
Reliance bucked the line steadily
for yard after yard, and before time
was called bad another touchdown,
Butte not having possession of the
ball after the kick-off. Oliver again j
missed the goal.
In the second half the ball was
worked slowly up and down the
field for some time; now in Butte's
territory, now in Reliance's, but
soon the hard line-bucking Re
liance had done in the first half
began to tell in Butte's favor. The
maroon stockings were forced back
little bv little, fighting for every
yard. Butte could only gain
enough ground to bold the ball, but
it never failed in that. On the live
yard line the Reliance men made a
desperate rally, fora touchdown!
meant defeat for them, but they
could not entirely stop the advance
of the Montana men, and Lasswell
placed the ball within a yard of the
line. The teams were in line, and
Captain Brooks had given the sig
nal for the next play when the
whistle blew, and Reliance had won. I
