# An American School at Rome.
## 
### 
On October 15 an American
school was instituted in Home in
quarters on the Pineian Hill. This
latest enterprise of America in the
Old World will encourage the study
of archaeology, art, literature, and
history in Italy. The plan was
originated at a meeting of the
archaeologists in Philadelphia last
winter, and a committee, consisting
of Professors W. (<. Hale of the
University of Chicago, Minton
Warren of Johns Hopkins Uni
versity, and A. L. Frothingham,
•Jr., of Princeton, was appointed to
consider the feasibility of establish
ing such a school at Rome. It was
decided by this committee, in order
to secure wide-spread support, to
invite other men representing vari
ous colleges to join the committee.
Thus there are now representatives
of nearly fifty institutions on the
committee, of which a strong sec
tion is already established in Rome
itself. The seat of the school will
be in the Ludovisi Villa on the
Pincian Hill. This building is to
be shared not only with the Ameri
can School of Architecture, but also
with the Schools of Sculpture and
Painting. The four schools will
probably together form one acad
emy and will have much in com
mon in their work.
Although the school is only open
from October 15 to June 1, its
members are expected to continue
their work until August, on a plan
approved by the directors. The
object of the school is to promote
such studies as Latin literature,
inscriptions in Latin and dialects,
Latin palaeography, the antiquities
of Rome; and the archaeology of
ancient Italy. How far this broad
iie]d will be actually covered each
year will depend upon circumstan
ces. There will be regular courses
of lectures, but most of the work
will consist of informal talks at
museums, visits to the monuments,
and excursions to ancient sites of
Etruria, and even as far as Sicily.
A large part of the duties of the
directors will consist in informal
advice and personal assistance to
each student in his independent
work.— Yale Ahrmni Weekly.
