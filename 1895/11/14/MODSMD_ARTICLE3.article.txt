# The 						Vaudeville.

### 
Seats for the minstrel and vaude-'
ville entertainment to be given in
the Bush Street Theater Thanks
giving night will be placed on sale
on the campus, commencing at 9
a.m. next Thursday, Nov. 21, and
closing here Saturday afternoon,!
Nov. 28. This well give the Stan
ford students ample time to secure
their seats before the Berkeley stu
dents or people of San Francisco
have an opportunity to reserve
any. As Berkeley was unable to
secure a house in which to hold
their entertainment they maybe
expected to make a grand rush for
seats at the Bush Street Theater;
when our box-sheet is opened in
San Francisco,so it behooves all the
Stanford people who desire seats to
secure them on the campus or there i
will be a repetition of last year's I
difficulty in securing seats in the ;
city. Advice from S;in Francisco]
states that there will be a rush for!
seats and the expectation is that
every one will be sold the day the j
box-sheet opens there. On account 1
of the demand for boxes exceeding
the supply the management has j
decided to auction each box on the j
campus, allowing our students the j
privilege of securing them all to the
exclusion of outside people. The
price of seats and the place of sale j
will be announced later.
