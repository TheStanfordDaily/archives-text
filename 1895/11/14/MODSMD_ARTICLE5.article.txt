# A
						USEFUL VOLUME.
## Directory of Stanford University and Palo Alto Just Published. 
### 
In former years the University
has issued each fall semester a
directory of the faculty and stu
dents. This year, however, it has
been turned over to private enter
prise with very satisfactory results.
The new "Directory of Stanford
University and Palo Alto" is a
small 12mo volume, neatly bound
in boards, from the press of the
H. S. Crocker Company. Like all
their work it is a model of typo
graphical neatness.
The first part of the book is de
voted to the University directory.
A list of the members of the Faculty
and other officers conies first.
Places of residence only are given.
An alphabetical list of students,
with their major subjects and Uni
versity addresses follows. If the
student is a graduate or a special
that fact is noted also. A supple
mentary list is added, containing
those living on the campus, but
not included in either of the other
lists.
Two pages are devoted to the offi
cers of the Associated Students and
of the four classes, and another to
Faculty "at homes." A fraternity
directory is given next, the location
of chapter houses included.
The directory of Palo Alto begins
with a list of the officers of the
town. Then conies the alphabeti
cal list of residents, with occupa
tions and places of residence.
Two full-page cuts lend attract
iveness to the volume, one an ex
cellent view down one of the long
arcades of the quadrangle, the other
a view of the business part of Uni
versity avenue, Palo Alto. An in
dex to contents, immediately after
the title-page, adds to the useful
ness of the directory.
Rufus Buck, '95, the publisher,
was assisted in the compilation of
the material by 0. V. Eaton, '95,
and C. M. Cram, '96.
The directory is on sale at the
Co-Op. Price, twenty-five cents. A
limited number of copies, bound in
cardinal cloth, were issued. The
price of these is fifty cents.
