# CHANGES IN CENTRAL PARK.
## Tickets to Be on Sale Next Monday at the Postoffice. 
### 
All the arrangements have been
made for the accomodation of 13,-
000 people at Central Park on
Thanksgiving day. It will be
necessary to construct a large line
of bleachers on the east and south
sides of the grounds. They will be
uncovered, but at the same time
will furnish an excellent view of
the field. This long line of bleach
ers on the east side of the grounds
will be divided, I C. taking the north
half and Stanford the south half.
Iti point of location there is abso
lutely no choice in the sections.
Stanford's half will comprise sec
tions T, U, V, and the seating
capacity of the three will be 1270.
Resides the bleachers, thirty-four
boxes will be built along the top
row of seats. They will be covered
and will afford the grandest view of
the field obtainable. In addition
to the new boxes there are six old
ones at the north end of the field.
On the west side of the field, ex
tending east from the Eighth-street
entrance,a sloping platform will be
built extending from the grand
stand to the fence near the side
line. This platform will furnish
standing room for '2,400 people, and
will be so constructed that all may
get a very good view of the field.
Standing room will also be sold all
the way around the grounds, but
the contractor assures us that those
occupying this space will not ob
struct the view from the bleachers.
Mr. Lang, father of H. H. Lang,
the U. C. manager, has charge of
the works and he says there need
be no fear of any of the structures
giving way. New material alone
will be used in the work and all
bracings will be made from very
heavy timbers. The old stands
will be inspected and strengthened
wherever necessary. The man
agement has been especially par
ticular in this regard, as they real
ize the importance of having stands
which are absolutely safe.
Tickets to the Stanford section
will be put on sale Monday in the
postotfice, the hour to be posted
Monday morning, and all tickets
unsold Thursday evening will be
sent to San Francisco and placed
on sale there. Those desiring to se
cure seats in the Stanford section
will do well to purchase their
tickets before they are sent to San
Francisco. On all the ticketsto the
Stanford section are printed the
words, "Present at Mission-street
entrance." It is to be hoped that
those purchasing these tickets will
heed the instructions, as the Mar
ket-street and Eighth-street en
trances will, in all probability, be
fearfully crowded.
If parties of students or profes
sors desire boxes they can have
them made to suit their respective
parties. It will be necessary, how
ever, for them to purchase their
tickets when handing in the num
ber in the party. The price of the
tickets will be as follows: Boxes,
$2 and $2.50; seats, $ 1.50; standing
room or general admission, $1.
