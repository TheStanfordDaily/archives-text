The ex-students composing the
"Stanford Lunch Club" intend to
meet hereafter at the Cafe Zinkand
on Market street, above Powell, and
would like to have this restaurant
made the headquarters of the Stan
ford people when in the city. The
cafe is not one of the city's cheap
restaurants, but it is reasonable,
and the proprietor has offered a dis
count of one-lifth to Stanford peo
ple. The club has interviewed other
places, and finds this the only one
that suits the purpose. Ladies,
alone or with escorts, can go here
with comfort, and everything is very
nicely served. The restaurant will
take care of parcels left there dur
ing the day. It, is advisable that
some place be selected as regular
headquarters before Thanksgiving
day, and as the ex-students intend
to meet at the Cafe Zinkand they
would like to find the University
people there. The arrangements
made with the management apply
only to Saturdays.
