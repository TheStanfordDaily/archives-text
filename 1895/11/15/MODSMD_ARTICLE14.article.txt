It is gratifying to note that the
faculty committee at Berkeley in
tends to see that the agreement re
garding eligibility of players is to
he strictly enforced. The com
mittee's action in ruling out two of
the Berkeley players from the list,
would indicate that U. C. is just as
anxious as Stanford is to have the
high standard of intercollegiate
sport maintained.
The agreement as drawn up last
year between Stanford and Berk
eley contained certain very wise
provisions, and one of these clauses
was in reference to eligibility of
players for the Varsity. That pro
vision was adopted only after care
ful consideration and discussion;
its purpose was to prevent any but
actual college men from taking
part in an intercollegiate match.
It would therefore be a very dan
gerous and unfair policy to permit
the slightest breach of this provis
ion.
Berkeley's action reassures Stan
ford and signifies the intent to live
up to the letter of a wise agreement.
