Next Thursday the champion
ship game of football between Bel
mont and St. Matthew's School
will he played on our gridiron.
The game promises to he hotly con
tested, and one well worth seeing.
Hut aside from all considerations
of pleasure it will he the part of
wisdom for the student body to
show general interest in this game
and to treat the visitors, both as
teams and individually, in such a
manner as to make lirm friends of
them.
Two of Berkeley's strongest fresh
man football men were drawn from
these two schools. Kaarsberg grad
uated Inst year from St. Matthew's
School and Carr from Belmont.
This year one of the Belmont team
and the star man of the St. Mat
thew's team at least are seniors and
both are men who in the natural

course of events will come to Stan
ford next year. The reception
| given these teams should be such!
that not only may these two be;
i won for our football squad, but in ad
j dition the other members may go,
I away with a warm place in their j
hearts for Stanford.
