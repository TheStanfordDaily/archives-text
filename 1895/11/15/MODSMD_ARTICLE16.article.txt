Should Stanford never graduate
a class with less firm devotion than
the''Pioneers," her prospects would
I indeed be bright. In numberless
ways have Stanford's first graduates
shown their unswerving loyalty to
their alma muter, and the interest
which they take in their college
does much towards creating the
right spirit within the student
body itself.
Through the efforts of our grad
uates the good name of Stanford
University has been imprinted in a
thousand places where it will do
the most good. Contributions to
the laboratories have been made by
graduates who were in a position to
do so. This patriotism has also
been evinced by the interest taken
in athletics and the efforts of U JS to
aid our team in every way avail
able. The organization of the
Olympic eleven was due largely to
the infiuence of '95 men who knew
the value for Stanford of practice
against an outside eleven. The
game yesterday afternoon would
have been impossible but for several
"Jo men.
A strong active alumni is a
source of infinite strength to a col
! lege. A fabulous endowment
without a possession of good will
could be of little avail in elevating
i a university to its proper plane.
| Stanford, however, is fortunate in
possessing both rich endowment
! and a warm hold on popular favor
| which is every day being increased
by its devoted graduates.
