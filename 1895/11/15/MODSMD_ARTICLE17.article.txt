Some time ago there appeared in
the )'<ilc Newx an article by Walter
Camp advising the introduction of
the Rugby game of football into the
American colleges for the benefit of
the men who for various reasons do
not play the intercollegiate game.
A few days later an article de
scriptive of this form of football ap
peared in the same paper, of which
the following is an abtract of the
main points.
In the tirst place Rugby is played
with fifteen men on a side. Of
these one is a fullback, three or
four are three-quarter backs, two
are halfbacks, and the remainder
are forwards. It is the duty of the
forwards to form a "bully, 1 ' as the
scrimmage iscolloquially termed, \>y
crowding closely about the ball
with heads lowered, and when
"play" is called to endeavor to
force the opposing forwards back
and by kicking the ball to drive it
in the direction of the opponents'
goal line. During the scrimmage
it is not lawful for any player to
touch the ball with his hands.
The forwards should, however, make
it their aim to "heel out"' the ball,
so that one of the halfbacks of their
own side, who take up their posi
tion immediately behind the
''bully," may have an opportunity
to take it.
This player in turn passes the
leather on to one of the three
quarter backs, or in fact to any
man out of the scrimmage who ap
parently has a good opportunity to
gain ground in a run. The run
ner, upon being tackled, tries to
pass the ball to some other member
of his team, instead of holding it
until fairly downed, as is now the
custom. The ball may thus be
passed several times from one
player to another before anyone
man is fairly "held" and the ball
declared "down" by the referee.
This system of passing is con
demned at tirst sight by every Amer
ican football player, as it involves
the risk of losing the ball. But
when it is brought into considera
tion that at the formation of the
scrimmage the ball is common
property, and therefore the posses
sion of it before the scrimmage is
of no especial value, it is easily
understood why the practice is al
lowed t«» enter so prominently into
the English game.
Scoring occurs when a "try"(i. e.,
touchdown) is obtained or a goal
kicked. The former counts one
point and the latter three. When a
goiil iskicked from a "try" the total
score is three points.
Practically the same rules exist
in the Rugby game as in the Ameri
can game regarding "off-side play"
and bringing the ball in from out
of bounds.
From a knowledge of these few
particulars, the principal points of
difference in the English and
American games can be readily
noted. The movement in the former
is much more lively, for the ball is
almost continually in motion, and
is carried up and down the field
with much more freedom than is
tlie case in our game. For this
reason Rugby is a very interesting
game to watch; but it does not offer
much opportunity for the employ
ment and science and "head work,"
nor for the introduction of premedi
tated plays, of which the members
of the team are apprised by means
of a code of signsils. This game can
be very readily taken upand played
without demanding anv great
amount of practice or training from
the players, and if once introduced
and well started would surely win
for itself a large degree of popu
larity.- Yale Ncus.
