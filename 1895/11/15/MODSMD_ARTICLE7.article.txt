# STANFORD VS. SAN FRANCISCO.
## A 						Poorly-Contested Practice Game. 
### 
The Varsity played a game with
a team known as the San Francisco
eleven yesterday. The members of
this team were recruited from the
Peerless, Olympic, and Reliance
Athletic Clubs. Several of the play
ers were U. C. students, who are
playing with these clubs.
The visiting team was very light
and had very little team work and,
although the men played a plucky
game, Stanford had a decided walk
over, the score at the end of the
game standing 22-0 in favor of the
Varsity.
Stanford's play was very slow
and the men because they thought
they had a walk-over took very
little interest in the result. Any
team used to snappy play could
have taken easy advantage of them
on account of their slowness in lin
ing up.
There was a fair-sized crowd out,
and the grounds were in splendid
shape.
The halves lasted fifteen minutes
each, and Stanford scored two
touchdowns in ea'ch half. Cochran
kicked the first three goals, but
failed to try at the fourth.
Pedler, Westover, Davis, Madden,
Plate, and Reynolds did the best
work for the city boys. H. Reynolds
and Plate were put on the athletic
team because the Frisco lads failed
to bring along one of their half
backs.
After five minutes play Stanford
made a touchdown, and Cochran
kicked a goal. Before the short half
was up Jack Reynolds had gone
over the line for another touch
down and Cochran again kicked a
goal.
After a few minutes play in the
second half Reynolds made a thirty
yard run and a touchdown, and
Cochran kicked a third goal. Again
a touchdown was made without ef
• fort, and no attempt at goal was
i made. Time; score, Stanford 22,
| Olympic 0.
