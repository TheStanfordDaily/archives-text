# BY A NARROW MARGIN.
## Stanford Wins from Olympic by the Score of 6 to O. 
### 
The game on Saturday proved
the hardest battle of the season for
Stanford. It was only after the
fiercest kind of a contest that Stan
ford was able to score against their
brawny opponents. Even then,
the Olympics claimed that the col
legians had failed to score.
The day was decidedly warm
and, in consequence, all of the gin
ger seemed to be thawed out of the
players. In all probability there
would have been fewer vacant seats
in the grandstand if the sun's rays
had been less scorching.
The Olympics surprised many by
their excellent playing. They out
played Stanford at many points in
which Stanford was considered
stronger. Sexton, Morse, Smith,
and Madden made the best show
ing for the city boys. Morse made
most of the gains for his side, while
Sexton was not far behind him in
ground gaining; Madden was a
stone wall at end. The Stanford
interference was partly to blame
for his tine showing, from the fact
that, instead of knocking him down,
he was allowed to tackle the man
with the ball. "Stanford had
plenty of men in the interference
but the interferers ran as though
they were practicing signals and
had no one to oppose them," as an
old player said. The work of Stan
ford was weakened by the many
changes in the positions.
The runs for the Palo Alto boys
were made principally by the Rey
nolds brothers, Weldon, Spalding,
and Cochran. Weldon's punting
was far ahead of that of the Olym
pic fullback. Spalding made the
longest run of the day and nearly
landed the ball over the line fora
touchdown.
In the early part of the game
Olympic seemed to be able to push
our men along at will, but later the
Stanford boys took a brace and
held them down. The poorest
feature of t he game was the slow
ness with which the men lined up.
Porter kicked-off fora distance of
45 yards. Weldon caught the ball
and after a short run returned in
touch. Olympic's ball on their 45
yard line.
Olympic then proceeded to push
the ball down the field in the most
approved fashion. Stanford seemed
powerless to prevent their short
gains. Even after being tackled
the runner would be shoved along
fora yard or two. In this way UO
yards were gained in nine downs.
Smith was then given the ball and
was not stopped until he had car
ried it ten yards. Code downed
Morse 4 yards behind the line and
Williams got the ball on a fumble.
Weldon punted in touch. Olympic's
ball at center.
Porter gained 2 yards, Sexton lj
yards, but Smith failed to gain.
Stanford's ball. The Palo Alto
men immediately lost it on a
fumble. Smith was downed with
out gain and Hawkins punted in
touch. Stanford's ball.
The ball was passed to Weldon
fora punt, but everyone expected
to see the kick blocked; but he
stood far back and stepping aside
let drive at the ball just as an
Olympian struck his shoulder. The

ball rose in the air and soared for
nearly fifty yards into the Olympic
territory, netting again of 85 yards
from the line. Morse carried it
back 5 yards.
Stanford punted on the first
down at this period of the game.
This undoubtedly prevented the
college men from running up a
higher score for they could gain as
long as they kept the ball.
On the next six downs the Olym
pic backs hit the tackles for an ag
gregate of 15 yards.
llarry Reynolds left the game
and Cotton took his place at half.
Code went to the end and Mcintosh
was placed at quarter.

to gain on the next down, and Wel
don punted 25 yards. Williams

yards through the line. Ficke'rt
downed Thierhauf without gain

on the following down but then

field. Stanford's ball on fumble.

Reynold's ball.
After small gains, Cochran made

a run of 10 yards. Stanford lost
ground, but immediately regained
it and worked the ball to tlie 20-
yard line. Spalding then took the
ball and after a splendid run
landed it across the line, but was
brought back to the 3-yard line for
running in touch. Then ensued a
battle royal, in which, after three
downs, Weldon carried the ball
through the center anil over the
line. Olympic disputed the de
cision of the umpire. Cochran
kicked the goal. Score, Stanford
6, Olympics 0.
After a few moments of play, time
was called with the pig-skin near
the center.
