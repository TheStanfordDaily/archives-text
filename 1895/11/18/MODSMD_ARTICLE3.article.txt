tunity for students to secure seats

found necessary to place the seats
on the lower floor at $1.50 and bal
cony seats at $1.25. The general
admission tickets will be sold at
$1.00 and can be obtained only at
the Bush Street Theater.
The management lias decided to
furnish a handsome 88 page souv
enir to each person who attends.
This souvenir will contain cuts of
the University and surroundings,
the Glee Club, Orchestra, Mandolin
Club, Football team, etc., the cover
being cardinal boards with a beauti
ful design printed in silver. No
expense has been spared to make
this souvenir one of the attractions
of the evening.
The management desires that
every one should distinctly bear in
mind that no partiality will be
shown in the sale of seats and no
one person can secure more than
six seats. Every one must "line
up" for seats, as none will be held
out for anyone. Boxes will be
