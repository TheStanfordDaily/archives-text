As we get well on in the semes
ter's work, the old wail arises
against the early turning out of the
lights in the halls. We are aware
that a great deal of space in these
columns was wasted last year upon
this subject. We say wasted ad
visedly, for our long continued ex
pression of student opinion pro
duced not the slightest effect upon
the authorities.
Now comes an order requiring
the strict enforcement of the rule
against lamps and coal oil in Uni
versity buildings. Students found
with coal oil in their possession are
to he denied the privileges of the
halls.
The case stands as follows: one
must either invariably finish his
studying by 10:30 p.m., or he must
ruin his eyes by the use of a candle.
Of course there are some model stu
dents who keep their work entirely
up to date, who never have any
outside calls upon their time, who
are prepared for an examination at
any moment, and who may there
fore retire regularly at 10:80 with
a clear conscience. Such persons
are, however, the exception. Al
most all of us must, at times, work
beyond the common hours of study.
Fully half the inmates of the halls
are accustomed to study later than
10:80; any one who will count the
lighted windows in Encina at 11
p.m. will be convinced of this fact.
The ordinance against coal oil is
perfectly reasonable, if some substi
tute is provided. But is one to be
blamed if he evades some of the
rules its an alternative to ruining
his eyesight ?
