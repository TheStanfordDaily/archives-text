Beginning with Harvard's ac-1
cession to the elective system some!
ten years ago and continuing until!
the present day, there has been a I
constant and steady growth of a
new ideal in American education. |
Our greater institutions of higher
learning were founded upon lines
closely approximating to those of
Oxford and Cambridge. Culture,
the bringing of the mind and soul
to the highest point of intellectual :
and ethical perfection, was there
fore the end for which they strived. |
Our educators did not consider that J
our national character and tenden-1
cies were largely different from
those of the lOnglish, that we were
as yet making a place for our race
in the world's affairs, and that the
highest degree of culture might

occupy for the time a secondary
place. Then came Harvard's sud
den change of policy, and behold
the American people, seeing a good
thing, began as usual to run it into
the ground. Some of the most
conservative of the old universities
have left the beaten classical tracks
to plunge wildly in the opposite
direction, and are today turning
out men finished, specialized, but
extremely narrow. It speaks ill
for college education when a tech
nical student graduates with no
knowledge of language, literature,
or any of the humanities, or when
a student of literature leaves col
lege taking with him only the
froth and trimmings of knowledge,
and without a practical or utili
tarian idea in his head. Tlieseare,
of course, extremes, but they illus
trate common effects of the present
system. On the other hand, the
old idea of culture pure and simple
was even more incomplete.
The truth lies between the two
systems. Doubtless when the new
universities have taken their place
in the college world and the pres
ent unsettled state of affairs has
subsided, the universities will accept
the golden mean between orna
mental luxury and strict utility.
Meanwhile some late actions of the
authorities at Oxford and Cam
bridge would indicate that even the
conservative British are looking
toward a change in the policy
which has prevailed in those old
seats of learning for the last four
centuries.
