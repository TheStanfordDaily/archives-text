# The 						Sunday Sermon.

### 
The Sunday sermon was deli vered
by Rabbi Voorsanger of San Fran-j
cisco on "Life with and without a
motive." He said in part as fol
lows:
There is a compilation of ethics
known as "The Ethics of Thej
Fathers," in which the old rabbi (
Antigones gives this exhortation: j
"Be ye not like servants or slaves, |
who serve their master on condition
of receiving reward; but be ve like;
servants who serve their master on j
condition of not receiving a reward ;|
and let the fear of Heaven be upon ,
you." !
1 sometimes fancy that these old
rabbis, line scholars as they were,
glared at one another with all the |
ferocity of the coming football j
teams on Thanksgiving day. But i
with them it was not a question of j
championship to be rewarded with
a cup, but a question of the
motives of human life; a question ,
like that with a great many of our j
modern philosophers, of looking
into the actual necessities of thej
common masses, and finding for j
them the gateway that is to lead i
them from their earthly hovels to
Heavenly palaces above (if such a
thing exist).
Now to us how curious is the
winding of this simple proposition.
Antigones simply meant to give
his people the general recommend
ation that they should love God
with all their mind and heart and
soul.
But some one will object if there
be no reward for labor performed;
if the same relations do not exist
between God and man as between
employer and employed, then we
are nothing but slaves; and the
proposition is to ascertain how
many lashes will force a man to go
to work. On the other hand, per
haps we are like employes who re
ceive a due consideration for every
thing done, and therefore are gov
erned upon perfect terms of equal
ity with their employer. Indeed it
may be said that if God does not
reward, then there is no use of ser
vice. The Sadducees claimed that
entire justice is obtained in this
world, and that the hereafter is not
therefore of any necessary interest.
The first teachings of the Epicurean
school were to the same effect.
But what does all this lead to?
It led to the writing of the book of
Ecclesiastes, whose author was a
Sadducee. He believed that noth
ing has enduring merit; that men
work from youth to old age; retire
at night, rise at morning, work out
the day, and finally in the course
of time disappear. He says noth
of the motives of human life that
makes it worth living; he sees
nothing but the alpha and omega
of life placed before his eyes on the
blackboard of human experience,
lie would see nothing in a Paris
but the evidence of its past history;
he knows nothing of the grand
hopes of the future. So with every
man whose view is always retro
spective, and never directed toward
the future.
But today we are brought face to
face with the question, is lifesimply
an emanatior.of itself,or is it occupied
with higher motives, resting upon
the actual necessities of humanity,
and upon relations which the ne

eessities of humanity hear towards
a God?
In answering this question the j
most practical standpoint is not I
that of the philosopher hut <>f the |
ordinary man. J <!<> not under
stand life without a motive. If
the moral sanction of man, for in- 1
stance, is sufficient in itself, 1 do not j
understand the higher relations
that man has with his God, and li
' j
do not see where the hope of hu-j
inanity comes in. Some historical j
and scientific authorities may il-!
lustrate my idea. A number of
sects have agreed that a certain one
having died was resurrected and as
cended to the Father, and that at
such and such a time He will ap
pear again, and that wonderful
things will take place at this
second coming. This is a beauti
ful doctrine; beautiful in that it
sets up a romantic future, an ideal
standard which it is probably worth
while to live up to. But in the
meantime what is the consequence
of such a doctrine? For some of
those who believe it it is beneficial;
it has robbed other people of their
ambition in life, and they have
sold their chattels and become
hopelessly lazy and inactive wait
ing for the good time coming.
Others who cannot believe this
doctrine are either unaffected by it
or receive a detrimental influence
from it.
Again, a scientist determines that
"sometime in the dim distant future
this earth will become a cold body
on which every possible living thing
must have relinquished its life.
Whether this be true or not I know
not, but granting that it is (a true
deduction of a more or less exact
science), and that such will be the
end of this world's existence, yet
; L say such doctrines are pernicious,
j because the common masses do not
live on science and cannot live on
j exact truth. And therefore if the
i masses are to be immediately bene
; fitted by science it must take cog
j nizance of the unhappiness and
i passing nature of humanity. The
masses are being guided and gov
j erned by stern necessities, even
after the suggestion of the illustri
ous founder of the Christian race
who began his prayer to his Father
"Give us this day our daily bread."
If every man were a professor of
philosophy, and but little less than
an angel, 1 would say, yes, teach
! your friends philosophy, and let us
I go and worship the Omniscient
j Spirit of whom everything that ex-
I ists is a determining element. Hut
we are not a little, but a great deal
1 less than angels; we are most of us
I but the poor dust that lies in the
desert.
The motive of life must be as yet
j in the main the relation that man
i has with the Supreme Being and
the consequent accountability and
responsibility which that idea en
genders in the human breast. 1
cannot go to a widow weeping over
her dead husband and teach science
to her. The tears of that woman
and her appeal to Heaven deserve
i greater consolation. Had I done
so, 1 would have told her the truth,
mark you, but this was not the
truth she wanted. She needs other
truth, couched in other words —
that there is another one who cares
for her, who loves her.

The doctrine that life ends in the
grave is another bad teaching for
humanity as a whole. Most men
look forward to the time when they j
shall surrender up their own indi
viduality to the Unknown, and we
do not need to teach immortality.
What they need is the doctrine of
human life in such a form before
them that it will set up a powerful
motive to righteous living. Scien
tists and religionists both agree
that life cannot be cut off. This
the masses will understand; and in I
. •
it lies the motive to have a com
petent reward for their lives and
the assurance that they will see the
face of their Father. Talk your
philosophy as much as you please;
but put yourself in the place of the
Salvationists who go into the slums
of the city and see whether they
can live lives without a, motive;
whether they know, or even care,
what the history of humanity is.
Humanity is not grown a great
deal after all, and it is hungry and
needs the truth.
The safety of society, the peace
of the country as yet rests in the
establishment of right conduct and
motives for human life; and with
the great mass of humanity this
must be done, not with the techni
calities of the scientist or philos
opher, but rather with the words of I
the kindergarten teacher.
