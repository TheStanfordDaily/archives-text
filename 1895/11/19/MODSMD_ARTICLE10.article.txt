Thk lirst sale of seats, on the
rampus, for the Thanksgivinggame
takes place tomorrow. It is com
menced this early in order to give
thoseon the campus an opportunity
to purchase seats in the section

which it is hoped to reserve for Stan
ford University exclusively. But
in order to do this it is necessary of
course that all the tickets be bought
by Stanford students or their
friends. Last year the same plan
was tried, but not enough tickets
were sold here to entirely lill the
section with our adherents, and as
a result many outsiders came to
occupy places in the same division.
Through youth, and principally
through lack of extensive alumni,
Stanford has not the number of
active sympathizers in San Fran
cisco and immediate vicinity that
Berkeley has. Nowhere was this
more evident than at the game last
year, when, in point of actual
though none the more enthusiastic
supporters, Berkeley outnumbered
us three to two. But this need not
disturb us. Stanford has plenty of
sympathizers and plenty of energy
and enthusiasm to make up for
what are lacking. What is needed
is to impress upon the minds of all
the necessity and the value of hav
ing our forces well marshalled on
that day. To this end every stu
dent, whether he be accompanied
by friends or not. should purchase
his seat, not in the neutral or gen
eral sections, but in the section set
aside for Stanford use, 4 and upon
which the cardinal is to depend
for its chief support. By concerted
action much can be done in fur
nishing to the team this united
support.
