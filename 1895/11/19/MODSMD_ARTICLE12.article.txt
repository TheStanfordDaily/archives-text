The following circular of Nov.
14, 1'895, has been issued by the
Sierra Clul):
To the Members of the Sierra Club:
The genera] meeting of the Sierra
Club was held, in accordance with
the notices sent out, on Saturday,
October 26. Among other busi
ness, an amendment to the by
laws, proposed by the board of
directors, abolishing the initiation
fee, was discussed and finally
adopted. It was the general opin
ion of the members present that
(he initiation fee prevented many
from joining the club and that by
doing away with the payment the
membership list could be largely
increased. Such an increase is so
much to be desired that it is urged
upon the members that each of
them should make an effort to ob
tain ;is many new ones as possible.
With a large and active member
ship the work and usefulness of
the club can be materially in
creased and extended.
The condition of the National
Parks and the Timber Reservations
was reported on by Mr. John Muir
and Mr. James C. Runcie; and it
was determined to make this the
topic for discussion at the annual
public meeting of the club to be
held on Saturday evening, Nov. 20.
Prof. W. R. Dudley of Stanford
University has also made extended
observations in the same regions,
and he as well as Mr. Muir may be
expected to report at this meeting.
The importance of the subject is
such that the interest of the public
should be aroused; the farmers and
irrigationists who desire the pres
ervation of the waterbeds of our
rivers have the same interest as the
lovers of the mountains.
The purpose of this meeting is so
great and of such public import
ance that the members are urged
to assist in securing a large attend
ance. Cards of notification are
sent with this circular and addit
ional ones will be promptly mailed
on application; although they are
not necessary to secure admission.
Respectfully yours,
Elliott McAlister,
Sec. of Sierra Club.
