One of the pleasantest and most
unique social events of this semester
was the Dramatic Evening given
by the Delta Tau Delta at their
home Friday, Nov. 15. Great care
had been lavished on the decor
ations. The parlors had been con
verted into a dancing-floor by
means of canvas, and the rooms
were decorated by smilax, madrone,
mistletoe, and chrysanthemums.
The spacious piazzas were inclosed
with canvas and lit up with Japan
ese lanterns, and here refreshments
were served. The following dra

the members of the fraternity and
their friends:
