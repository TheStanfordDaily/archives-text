						Hotly Contested Practice.

### 
The second team l>y hard work
and judicious line-bucking man
aged to score a touchdown against
their opponents last night. They
kicked-off and managed to keep the
ball in the Varsity's half of the lot
until they were able to rush the pig
skin over the line and score a
touchdown. Dole and Frazier
were principally responsible for the
score. Each of them left several
yards behind him at every at
tempt. Dole left the field soon
after the touchdown, but Frazier
played through the game and made
repeated good gains through the
line.
After the Scrubs bad taken their
time at scoring the tables were
turned and the first eleven had
things pretty much their own way.
The play as a whole was very slow.
There was a very apparent lack of
the article known in football par
lance as "ginger."
Another point where the men fail
to show improvement is in tackling
after breaking through the line.
The heavy men broke through
time after time, but seemed lost
when they found themselves in
close relation with their adver
saries' backs.
Mr. Camp was ably assisted in
coaching by Harrelson, Walton,
Lewis, and Field. Lewis had
donned a suit and played end on
the second team for part of the
practice.
Many of the players had either
forgotten the signals or had never
known them. This caused much
confusion at times. Such a state
of affairs at this late stage of the
game is inexcusable. It is the
' fault of no one but the players
themselves, and each man should
make it a point to know the sig
nals.
Kickert and Thomas did the best
work at guard. It was nip and
1 tuck between Carle and Lewers at
; center. Cochran played his usual
j game at tackle. Campbell was not
| far behind him in his work. Jeffs
played end again and held his own
lin good style. Spalding, behind the
j splendid interference of Jack
Reynolds, made a touchdown from
' the center of the field.
