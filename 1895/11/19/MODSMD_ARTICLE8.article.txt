The question lias been asked,
why should educational institutions
of this state be taxed under the
laws for the benefit of the school
fund upon which they have no claim?
It does seem unjust, especially when
we stop to consider the number of
eastern universities exempt from
this tax, which are enjoying a snug
little revenue of about $150 per
student per annum, while at this
University nearly one thousand
students are receiving free instruc
tion. Furthermore legacies to this
institution are taxed five per cent,
for the benefit of the same school
fund. From our point of view
things need adjusting.
