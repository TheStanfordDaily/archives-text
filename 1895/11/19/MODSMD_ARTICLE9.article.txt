It is to be hoped that those in
charge of the vaudeville entertain
ment for Thanksgiving night will
see fit to follow out the recom
mendations of some members of the
Faculty in regard to the character
and conduct of the different acts
and presentations of the same. Let
there be no attempt at coarseness
or even a suspicion of grossness or
vulgarity; for as this is practically
a Stanford entertainment the repu
tation of our college depends to a
great extent upon the relative
character of the show. It has well
been said that there is no better
way of estimating the real worth of
a university than by judging of the
personal and collective conduct of
her representatives on public oc
casions. Accordingly it is of the
utmost importance that the char
acter of the coining entertainment
be above the slightest reproach, for,
as the standard of excellence is
high or low, so will the calm and
deliberate estimate of our worth
formed by the critics be.
