# "The Evils of Land Ownership."
## 
### 
Prof. H. H. Powers spoke last
evening in the chapel on the "Evils!
of land ownership." The substance j
of his lecture is as follows:
In discussing the evils of the
present system of land ownership
we must not confine ourselves to j
that alone, but must also take up '
and discuss the system which is
proposed in its stead. And in this I
connection I can not do better than)
to take the statement of Henry
(ieorge. lie begins by stating that
the old ownership is based on
natural right; that is, land on j
the one hand and these otherl
things, or wealth in general, on the.
other. They differ in that the!
latter are produced by man him
self, while land is not.
The second point made by Mr.
(ieorge is that this right allows I
man to tax those who are depend- 1
ent upon the land for support; in
a community whereevery one must
have land, those who are thus de
pendent can be made to pay for it.
And here enters the factor of rent,!
which means the return from land.
Rent is not only a grievous burden,!
says Mr. (ieorge, but it is a con-j
tinual burden and an increasing
burden. Not only must we pay
for land year after year, but rent
increases each year. With the in
crease of individual activities, there
are increasing demands made upon
the soil.
The third point is that all this is!
a huge privilege which does not be
long to those who receive it from
society; this is the theory of the
unearned increment of land. And
in the fourth place, he says that
not only is this unearned, but it
excuses a man from earning any
thing in any other way. And
finally, in addition to sitting still
arid letting society make his money
for him, he is very apt to be in
society's way. Instances of this
kind are exceedingly common, so
that we are led to accept the propo
sition of Mr. (ieorge as just.
The remedy proposed by Mr.
George is that a tax should be levied
in proportion to the rent or return
from land. He argues that tax
ation under the present system is
repressive to industry; but you can
tax land as much as you want to
for you touch nothing which might
restrict him in his industry. Hut
we must seek to find the advantages
or evils of this system as compared
with the one which it is intended
to supplant.
In the first place we must object
to the large use he makes of the
doctrine of natural right. If men
are to own only that which is the
result of labor, whose labor is it to
be? It seems to me that 1 would
have no more claim to the results
of the labor of my grandfather than
to that of my neighbor; therefore,
if we are to carry out this idea of
natural right, the law of inherit
ance will have to go along with the
rest. The doctrine of natural right
depends altogether upon what you
mean by it; the definition best
suited to our purpose is the ground
of general well-being. There has
never been any system which
amounted to much which did not
rest upon the idea that the general
well-being was the objective point
for society. We have to assume

then that the well-being is the
criterion by which these systems
are to he judged.
There is first of all the economic
well-being; that is, the question of
wealth. Not only which system
will give us the most wealth, but
how best it can be distributed. The
second phase is that of political
well-being; the third, moral well
being; and the fourth, that bearing!
on the problem of race progress. In j
regard to the economic well-being,!
I desire to call your attention first 1
to the two kinds of land: that used j
for tillage, and that used for other i
purposes. There is a great part of i
the agricultural work which works I
great hardship, and which I shall j
call the frontier work. There is al- j
ways a certain amount of this work
to be done; land at the; frontier is
practically worthless. If weinduce
a man to go to this land we can
give him no better inducement than
that some day the land will become
worth something, so it would be
only just to give him the rent, j
Now if all this were wiped out, the j
result would be large capitalistic!
holders, and the very thing which j
the advocates of this system desire I
—the building up of a yeomanry
—would be defeated. So much for
the condition of farm land. In the j
cities it is worse; the manwhoownsj
land is perfectly quiescent in re
gard to the increase of the value of j
the land. Mr. George says that
the man owning land in the city is !
excused from production, and this!
seems very reasonable; but the |
question is, how many men do re
main out of the production on ac
count of this income acquired from
rent? As a matter of fact it would
seem that it only excites them to
greater stimulus. The ambition
that actuates business men today is
business; it is not l»> build palaces
nor to make collections of paintings,
but all the attention is turned to
business; so when we ask what be
comes of these great fortunes ac
quired through rent, we must re
member that a, vast amount of the
money thus accumulated is used in
the business of society.
As to the political results, it is
obvious that we could have no such
thing as protection to home indus
tries under the single tax on rent;
nor high license on the sale of li
quors. It is a commonplace of
finance that the system of taxation
should be elastic. It has been
found useless to devise any system
j of taxation which should be elastic
; without being at the same diver
sified. In Europe the tax on rent has
| declined owing to the decline in
! value of the land. Take, for ex
ample, a new country where land
is of little value so that there could
be no rent and consequently no tax;
improvements are needed so that
j it is necessary to find some other
; means besides the tax on rent.
In regard to the last problem of
race progress 1 can say very little.
I can only suggest that the all-im
portant thing in race progress is
that we should continue in some
degree the selective agencies which
are now of so much use. There are
some who look upon this race prog
ress as useless. Mr. George says,
''We hope to put an end to this
struggle for existence." Is there
nothing in our present system that

has this selective idea? It seems
to me there is. We feel sorry for
those who are compelled to mort
gage their farms, but that is only
one way in which those who are
capable of running a farm are
selected out from those who are not. |
