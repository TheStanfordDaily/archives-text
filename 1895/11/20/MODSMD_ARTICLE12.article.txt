## 
### 
For some time numerous re
quests have been made that a
course in Money should be given
next semester, but the work planned
by the department of Economics
seemed to make an additional
course impossible. In view, how
ever, of the frequency of these, re
quests and the immediate import
ance of the subject in national
politics it has finally been decided
to give the course in lieu of the
course on Commercial Legislation
previously announced. The course
will be three hours a week, meet
ing the fourth hour <>n Monday,
Wednesday, arid Friday in room
21. It will be both historical and
analytical with reference to ascer
taining the laws of monetary phe
nomena and applying them to re
cent problems. It will involve
more or less original research on
the part of the class. This course
in Money and Credit will also dis
place the course in Money pre
viously announced for ihe first
semester of next year.
