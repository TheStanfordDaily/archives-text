The teams lined up at 3:30 and
for nearly an hour and a half the
men worked like majors. At the
close of the contest Reliance had
scored two touchdowns to Stanford's
one.
Both teams were considerably
handicapped by the absence of their
best men. Reynolds and Franken
heirner were unable to play for
Stanford and both the Reliance
regular ends were absent.
The greatest gains for Reliance
were made around their right end.
| When the left halfback took the
ball, he would take hold of the left
guard's hand and dash across the
| field behind two other men whose
duty if was to look out for the end.
| Again, when a Reliance man caught
j the ball on a kick there was a solid
wall of men in front of him which
protected him very successfully.
On a simple play by a Stanford
j man he was left almost entirely
. unprotected.
Carle kicked off for Stanford.
! Frick caught the ball and made
fifteen yards before he was downed.
Reliance gained repeatedly through
the line, but soon lost the ball to
Stanford. Cochran gained five
1 yards, Spalding was tackled behind
the line, and Dole gained ten yards.
I The ball see-sawed thus near the
I center of the field for some time.
Reliance ball on Stanford's forty
yard line. Hanlon was given the
ball and ran behind splendid inter
ference to the* sixteen-yard line.
! They then gained eight yards
through the center and received
half the distance to the goal line
j on Stanford's off-side play. On
; the next down the ball was carried
over the line.
Stanford kicked off to the 25-yard
line. Reliance returned to the 3<S
! yard line. Stanford then gained
steadily until they reached the 20-
1 yard line when they lost the ball.
Reliance was held down to small

gains and Stanford regained the
ball but soon lost it on a fumble.
Reliance made small gains and
Stanford got the ball again. Wel
don ran it in to the ten-yard line
011 a fake kick. And in three more
downs the ball was carried over the
line fora touchdown. The men
were then given rest during
which there were several changes
made in the line-up of the team.
The Stanford team was changed so
much that it virtually amounted
to a second eleven.
in the next half, Reliance made
one touchdown while we were un
able to push the athletic champions
very hard. The play was virtually
the same as in the first part of the
practice.
Hanlon, Wyckoff, and McMillan
made the best runs for Reliance.
Bert Oliver did some capital inter
fering. Bunker, : 9(i, held down
end for Reliance. Cochran, Plate,
Dole, Frazier, and Spalding made
good gains for the Varsity.
Frazier, Jeffs, and Spalding did
some fine tackling. Cotton and
Carle played their new positions
well. Fisher hit the line very hard
and made some good gains.
