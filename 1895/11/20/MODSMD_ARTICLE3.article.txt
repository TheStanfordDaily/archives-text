### 
The football game of St. Mat
thew's School vs. Belmont School
will be played on the Stanford
gridiron tomorrow at 2 o'clock.
This is the third and last game of
a series fora silver cup, presented
by Mr. Smith of San Francisco.
The lirst game was played at St.
Matthew's and resulted in a tie.
The second game was won by St.
Matthew's with a score of (5-0. If
Belmont wins this time the series
l will be a tie and the cup will prob
j ably go over for next year; should
St. Matthew's turn out victorious
again she will win the cup.
The teams are very evenly
matched and it promises to be an
exciting game. It is thought, how
ever, the chances at present are in
favor of Belmont, as they have
acquired two new men since the
game of two weeks ago.
The guards on the St. Matthew's
team have brothers attending
Stanford: Henion, '98,"andCurtner,
| '98. Henion, who graduates this
| year, is supposed to be the best
academic guard, and would stand
a good show of making the
Varsity in his freshman year.
The object of playing this game
jon our field is to get neutral
grounds and a disinterested crowd.
The players will arrive on the
1:17 train and go immediately to
the gymnasium to don their foot
ball suits.
