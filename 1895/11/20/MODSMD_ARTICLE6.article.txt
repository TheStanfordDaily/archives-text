When a crowd attending a lec
ture in the chapel is so large that
many are obliged to stand, there is
no excuse for those who go first to
leave so many unoccupied seats
between them. Certainly it is more
comfortable to have plenty of room,
especially if a lecture is found to be
long and tedious, but it should be
borne in mind that this selfishness
causes others either to stand or to
make an unusual disturbance
climbing over those in the outside
seats.
