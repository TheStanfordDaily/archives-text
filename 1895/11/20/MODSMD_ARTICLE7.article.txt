The two most prominent prepar
atory schools will tomorrow send
large delegations to witness the
final game of football between their
respective teams, which is to take
place on our gridiron. Unfortu
nately for Stanford, the majority of
graduates from these two institu
tions do not enter Stanford, though
a number of those that have entered
are numbered among our leading
athletes.
For many reasons it is a wise pol
icy for Stanford to cultivate the
friendship of these students. Tomor
row they should be shown everv
courtesy and our football players es
pecially should meet with their play
ers, many of whom are first-class
men. In fact, these teams play an
unusually fine game for preparatory
school elevens, developing material
which will some day be seen in
Varsity teams.
The game tomorrow promises to
be very interesting, considering
how high the football spirit is run
ning, and there should be a crowd
of Stanford students out to give
the visitors a rousing reception.
