Some complaints have been heard
about the football management's
policy in charging for admission to
the practice game between Reliance
and our team yesterday. Of course
it is deplorable that such action
was necessary, but no other course
could be chosen. There was no
money in the treasury and the
student body's credit is not good for
a dollar. Current expenses have to
be met, and no better plan for get
ting the necessary cash could be
devised. No charge will be made
for the remaining games. As was
said before, the student body has
no credit. There is but one man in
the entire neighborhood willing to
work on the gridiron and wait for
his pay. When he lias been away
the condition of the field has had to

suffer. Not a dollar can be bor
rowed on the credit of the Associ
ated Students. The football man
agement has borrowed between four
and five hundred dollars 011 per
sonal notes. In the face of such
measures as this, it illy becomes
any student to complain of the
charge for admission yesterday.
