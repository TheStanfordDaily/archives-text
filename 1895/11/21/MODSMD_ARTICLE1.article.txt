# A 						JOINT MEETING.
## Dr. Jordan's Address to the Y.M. C.A. and Y.W.C.A. 
### 
A joint meeting of the Y. M.and
Y. W. C. A.was held last evening
in the chapel. Dr. Jordan deliv
ered an address on ''The decadence
of Thompson." He spoke in part
as follows:
I thought perhaps the best thing
1 could say tonight would be to
bring to light certain thoughts that
came to me in reading a little story
in the Dial, which is about a man
named Thompson, it seems Thomp
son was a man who went to Ger
many with great social ideas and
spent five years there in blind
allegiance to the German professors;
there he learned something of the
respect with which the German
students treat their professors,
which amounts almost to reverence,
and their teachings are received
with the greatest authority. He
came back from Germany and
wanted to teach what he had
learned. He applied fora pro
fessorship, but he found that a
position was not so easy to find; he
found that the people were opposed
to his ideas, and his message was
not received with any special favor.
There was no reverence shown him
bv those who had charge of the
university professorships. He
pledged his word to teach nothing
that he did not believe to be true,
and he found in the study of social
science that his teachings would
have to he in accord with the rais
ing of money for the college. He
noticed too that these people did
not care for the ideas that he
did. Finally he came to take the
advice of one of his professors, that
he should not take things with too
much seriousness. Things went
on in this wav until at last he was
appointed to a professorship in a
certain college, and then he found
that the manners of the times were
about as good as they can be, and
then he was ready to teach. The
author of this story speaks of this
as the "decadence of Thompson,"
anil that was a loss of this man to
society.
Hut it seems to me that the sub
ject can be looked at in different
ways. There are many of these
men around Harvard, Yale, and
some about Columbia, and we meet
them every day. And it seems
to me that the times were not the
cause of his decadence at all.
There have always been the same
conditions around men as there
were around this man Thompson;
it is the test of Thompson, which
way he is going to turn. The truth
that he had learned he had written
down in his note-books and carried
it around with him as a sort of ex
ternal thing; he had to praise him
self up and say, "Now, I am not
going to teach anything which is
not true."
I remember a man who studied
in Germany and afterwards become
a professor in America, who wrote
a book called the New Philology;
he spent about twenty-five hundred
dollars in the preparation of this
work,but he found that the people
did not care very much about his
book until finally he said, "as
others do so will I," and nothing
more was ever heard of his book.

The test of a man does not come
when he is in the University, but
when he is thrown out in the cold
world; and then if he is a man, he
will be able to do what he started
out to do regardless of other people.
No man can become a leader of
men unless he has that in him to
lead himself; if he can not control
himself, he is not going to do very
much in the way of helping others.
Every man is a slave by virtue
of the primal hunger in his proto
plasm; every one of the fragments
of which man is made is full of
hunger which must be satisfied.
Every one has this primal hunger
and we must satisfy that, or that
in some one else. There will be a
great many who will refuse to do
this who will be in a sense run
away slaves, but those who do not
do their part find the work just so
much the harder; sooner or later
in the struggle for existence, we
ought to get rid of those who do
not earn their bread.
The things which a man really
does are those things which he does
without hope of reward. 1 was
talking some time ago with a
naturalist who complained that
zoology had never done anything
for him; that with all the books he
had written he was unable to make
any money. He did not deserve to
succeed nor to get anything out of
it, for he went into it merely to
make money; he did not do any
thing for science without expecting
recompense. Men who work for
fame are working on the same
basis as those who work for money.
The work we do as slaves and are
paid for does not last; the work
whichlasts is that which is done on
the basis of true manhood.
We hear a .great deal about the
duty of sacrifice; and whatever we
do in the way of sacrifice must be
over and above what we do for our
selves. And so it is I think the
purpose of an institution like this
to develop men and women for the
highest things in life, in business,
in professions, and in any field:
but beyond this we should be ready
for sacrifice in doing work for
others. 1 have thought how great
a field there is for physicians who
are really high in their professions
to go out among the people who
are suffering all over the country.
Success with a great many physi
cians means one or two things: it
means getting in with the rich and
making a showy cure, or getting in
with the poor and treating a large
number of cases. But this is not
the work of the real physician; the
real physician has thousands of
ways of helping the people. And
so the preacher's work is not only
the preaching of sermons, but in
going into the lives of the people.
A great deal of the suffering of the
people could be done away with if
people would only clean them
selves U]». It does not matter so
much whether one can draw a
large house, preach eloquent ser
mons, or be tried for heresy, but
the things which are useful are the
things which he will not get paid
for. And so it is with you, what
ever profession you go into —the
work that is worth anything is
that which no one will pay you for.
And you will find the same thing
as Thompson did.
