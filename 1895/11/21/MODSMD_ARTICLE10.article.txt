The faculty members have, as a
rule, this year avoided crowding
their examinations all at once
upon the students but have so ar
ranged that they were separated
from one another by sufficient in
tervals to give the students a res
pite between them. Heretofore the
week preceding the holiday vaca
tion has been one of the most try
ing of the semester on account of
the number of tests given during
that time. If the professors begin
early enough they should be able,
in most cases, to arrange all their
examinations for the last two weeks
of the semester, thus materially
easing matters for the students.
