Now that our fair sunny days
seem to be drawing to a close and
the " rigors of a California winter,"
as a Canadian here expresses it,
are about to set in, it is hoped that
care will be taken about heating
the rooms in the quadrangle. The
chapel is nearly always cold, and
in the large classes those who sit
farthest from the register often
suffer from cold to such an extent
that they lose the benefit of the
lecture. The fresh-air crank, too,
is ever present. He takes the
warmest seat in the room, and then
opens several windows and throws
his fellow student into chills. It
is infinitely better for him to be a
trifle too warm than that others
should shiver.
In the bustle of American life
in the fin de siecle, we forget the
origin of names and customs.
Thanksgiving to us is the day upon
which our eleven is to win or be
defeated by our opponent's eleven.
Christmas is the season in which
we have some fun and good eating
in the city and receive some pres
ents from home. Easter is the
breathing spell in which we catch
up back work and prepare for the
final pull that is to land us in the
big world with a diploma and
plenty of ambition.

It would not be an undesirable
thing to pause fora moment and
reflect upon the real significance of
these old holy-days. Though less
religious than our ancestors, we
are not less in need of religion, of a
spirit of thankfulness, of a time in
which we look backward and see
how far we have progressed. There
are still — even in our enlightened
age — people who go hungry,
people who are neglected, and on
whom the Christian light of educa
tion never shines. Shall we not
spare a moment from our vocifer
ous yelling of the inarticulate "Rah,
rah, rah! " to give thanks and be
the cause of the thankfulness of
others ?
