It is acknowledged that the
game of football is generally bene
ficial in its effects on students. But
unfortunately there are many who
can not play the game because of
lack of weight. These are cut off
from the enjoyment of playing the
game, and in college there are but
few sports to take the place of this
one which is barred. Would it not
be a very simple and practicable
matter to make some arrangement
so that lighter men might get the
advantages of football practice ?
It would seem entirely feasible
either to limit the weight of the
men, to say 150 pounds each, or
perhaps it would be better to limit
the weight of the entire team so
that the total weight would not
give a greater average than 150
pounds for each player. The latter
scheme would allow slightly heav
ier men to play at center and
i guards.
The points most in favor of such
a scheme would be its beneficial
athletic opening for participants,
danger of injury would be less
ened, and all the pleasure to the
spectator of witnessing quick active
playing would be presented. It
would appear that such an arrange
ment would tend to popularize the
| game with the public.
