# A 						TIE GAME
## The 						Teams Take Turns in Scoring. 
### 
The practice game last night
drew a large crowd of spectators
who sat on the bleachers and stood
on the side-lines cheering first one
side and then the other and ap
plauding every brilliant play. The
game was well worth seeing. It is
seldom so much football is played
even in a match game.
The work of the Varsity showed
great improvement over the play
of the preceding day. The inter
ference was far better and the men
put considerable ginger in their
play. At one or two points the
collegians showed of what they were
capable by gaining the ball on
downs after it had been driven well
into their territory.
Reliance seemed to have the ad
vantage of Stanford in many points,
but our men broke through the
line in such a manner that the
athletic boys were unable to form
as suberb interference as on Tues
day.

Sherrard, the regular Reliance
end, came down yesterday and put
up a fine game in his position.
Hector, the regular center, was on
hand and did some good work.
Harry Walton played halfback and
to him are due most of Reliance's
long runs. He made both of the
touchdowns for Reliance. His
Punting was very fair and he had
the advantage of Weldon in this
respect. "Doc" Hall played tackle
and played it as he used to play it
on our gridiron.
Jack Reynolds made one touch
down for Stanford, besides making
several other fine runs.
Weldon made the other touch
down by bucking the line. His
line bucking was very good and he
made one or two good tackles, but
failed to nail the runner soon
enough. He would wait for the
runner instead of running up to
him.
C. Thomas did the most brilliant
work of any of the line men. He
was through the line on nearly
every pass and followed the ball
splendidly.
B. Thomas, at half, made some
long gains. Fisher hit the line
very hard. Jeffs played a quick
game at end.
Plate made a splendid tackle on
Bert Oliver, throwing the big man
in the most approved style.
Carle did some capital interfer
ing, aiding the halfs materially in
ground gaining.
Reliance had things pretty much
their own way until the pig-skin
reached the Stanford five-yard line
Stanford then held the athletic

boys down and kicked the bull out
of danger.
After working the ball back and
forth for some time Harry Walton
broke out of a scrimmage and made
a touchdown.
The first points were scored for
Stanford by Jack Reynold's long
run.
Reliance's second touchdown
was made in a manner similar to
the first. A long run carried the
ball to the fifteen-yard line and it
was forced over on the next down.
Stanford scored again in the
second half by forcing the ball to
the five-yard line and then driving
it through the line.
