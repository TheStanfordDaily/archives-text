There are always a number of
" calamity howlers " among the
students just before the big game
who endeavor to keep the rest of
the students in a state of deep des
pondency by their own lack of en
thusiasm and their prophesies of
defeat. They seem to be unusually
conspicuous just now, when, as a
matter of fact, there is little need
of such ominous forebodings. Such
a sentiment has as injurious an
effect as a feeling of over-confi
dence. Neither should be given
the slightest encouragement. The
best policy for all Stanford stud
ents to adopt is to " say nothing
and saw wood." There is no oc
casion to lose heart over the pros
pects. We have a line lot of play
ers, they have all had plenty of
practice, and Camp has done sufli
cient wonders with our team in
previous years to warrant the ut
most confidence in his ability to
put forth a winning team this year.
