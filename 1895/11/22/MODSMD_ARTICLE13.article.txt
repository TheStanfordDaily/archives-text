The first tiling that impresses
an educated tourist who visits
Stanford University is the natural
beauty of its surroundings. They
imagine the students must live
away the spare moments of their
college life among the shady walks
of the arboretum or, book in hand,
drink in from some lofty foothill
the matchless view of the Santa
Clara valley. But how few of the
students improve their opportuni
ties ! How seldom does one out for

a stroll meet a fellow pedestrian.
The scenery is all that those of
poetic tendencies could desire to
set tlieni off into dreamy reveries;
the walks and paths leading to
every nook and cranny of the es
tate are in best possible condition
fora student to enjoy the effects of
an invigorating walk. Some with
materialistic aims are pleased to
term this idleness. But who can
say when he is most idle ? For
when we have thought our time
most wasted something may have
come to us worth more than many
hours of studying others' ideas.
