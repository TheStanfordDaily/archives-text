At the meeting of the Science As
sociation lasteveningDr.,). P. Smith
traced the development of the
physical geography of California
from the Archean time to the pres
ent. The history of this develop
ment is discovered chiefly by the
study of the fossil faunas. The
age and earlier conditions of ;i
regjpn are determinable by the
character of its fossil faunas and the
changes of former shore lines by
the migration of these faunas. The
Sierras have been above water
since the beginning of the Tertiary
period, but the Coast Range and
great California valley did not ap
pear until the end of the Pliocene.
Prof. I). W. Murphy, discussing
the determination of a light unit,
referred to the great difficulties in
the way of finding an acceptable
standard for light comparison. A
number of proposed standard lamps
were spoken of and an apparatus
by which a bit of platinum is
heated to incandescence and its
radiation determined was described
in detail. As yet there is no accepted
international light unit.
