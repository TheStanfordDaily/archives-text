# BELMONT DEFEATS SAN MATEO.
## The
						Result of This Game Leaves the Ownership of the Cup in Doubt for Another Year. 
### 
Belmont won the third and last
game of the cup series from St.
Matthew's yesterday by a score of
(i-0. The game was exciting from
| beginning to end and the result
| was in doubt until the referee's
j whistle gave the signal for cessation
I of play.
The Stanford field has never held
! a larger or more good natured crowd
in its short history. The Stanford
student body turned out en masse,
while the red and blue of St. Mat
thew's and the maroon and white
of Belmont were in evidence to no
small extent.
There was as much excitement
shown by the adherents of the opr
posing.schools as is generally seen
at the "big game" between the
Varsity teams. White-haired pro
fessors, students in military uni
form, and graduates of the schools
I walked up and down the side-lines
j shouting encouragement to their
J players, while the fair friends of
| the contestants applauded each star
j play from the grandstand.
The teams lined-up at 2:27, with
the men in the following positions:

In the beginning of the first half
, the boys from San Mateo had lit
j tie difficulty in rushing the ball
into dangerous proximity to their
I opponents'goal and after a hard
j tussle near the goal the ball was
j nearly carried over, but was fumbled
'and a Belmont man touched it
j back.
Twice after this San Mateo car
ried the ball well into Belmont's
j territory, but tried at field goal
i from the fifteen-yard line each time
land lost the ball, when they might
I have scored in line bucking.
At one time Belmont had the
| ball within a yard of scoring, but
| lost the ball on downs. In the
second half Belmont showed what
I could be done by them in the way
of line bucking. They drove the
! ball down the field in fine style
land Macondray made the only
j touchdown of the day. Carson
; kicked the goal, scoringsix points to
St. Matthew's nothing.
Some of the men played star
football. Wadsworth of Belmont
made some wonderful gains through
the line, and showed great spirit in
I contesting every inch. Reid put
jup a good game at guard. Carson
! punted and ran well.
llenion made the best showing
for the red and blue stockings. He
| is large and powerful and hits the
| line very hard.
Womble put up an excellent
j game at end, while Johnson made
i a very creditable showing at full
-1 back.
