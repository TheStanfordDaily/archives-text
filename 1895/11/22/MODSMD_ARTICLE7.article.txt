# The 						Regular Practice.
## 
### 
The preparatory school game
was followed by the Varsity-Re
liance practice. The Stanford men
made a very much poorer showing
than on the preceding night. The
line men seemed to have forgotten
all they had learned on Wednes
day night and played a very loose
game.
Reliance interference was splen
did, the runner being protected by
several men. The tackles and
guards for Stanford failed to do
their duty and in consequence the
backs would easily circle our ends
and Captain Cochran, who played
full-back, was left to tackle the
runner four times out of live.
The score stood a tie but it was
really a victory for Reliance as
Stanford's touchdown was made
entirely by chance.
