# Sale of Seats for the Vaudeville.
## 
### 
The sale of seats and boxes for
the vaudeville entertainment lias
been very satisfactory to the man
agement. The fraternities have
been very liberal in the purchas
ing of boxes, so that but one box
remains to be sold.
Tomorrow the seats will be on
salt; until 4 p.m. Those remaining
to be sold after this time will be
sent to the city. From the way
Berkeley students are writing down
here for seats the sale will last but
a day at most in the city.
Berkeley has been unable to se
cure a theater for an entertainment
on Thanksgiving evening and will
probably attend the exhibition in a
body. Good seats can now be se
cured at $1.00, $1.25, and $1.50.
The sale of seats will positively
close here at 4 p.m. tomorrow.
