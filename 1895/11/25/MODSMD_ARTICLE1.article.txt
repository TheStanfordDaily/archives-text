Address, Dr. Jordan.
Dr. Jordan spoke in part as fol
lows:
Emerson said, "Give me health
and a day and 1 will put the pomp
of emperors to shame." It is not
hard to put the pomp of emperors
to shame; all nature does this.
The life and surroundings of an
emperor are largely superficial,and
his pomp and pride are empty and
vain. And when he once begins to
see through the hollowness about
him he endures it with pain.
But the healt.y mind acts, and
the healthy body responds to its
noble impulse. We find our health
in activity of some kind, and with
out health of some sort it is pretty
hard to find any kind of happiness.
To be happy then we must find
time to exercise our mind. And
we should be very thankful that
through this means happiness is to
day so easy for us to gain.
As long as pain goes on we do
not notice it; it is when it stops we
begin to feel it. I suppose that if
there were no God, there would be
atheists, and people would be bad
fora while and then be good, and
then without feeling the difference
between good and bad, would re
turn to their evil ways again. But
with us it is different; when once
we become better the pain of our
past life is so painful to us, we feel
so keenly the difference between
good and bad, that we ever after
wards refrain from returning to the
evil. One may appreciate the dif
ference between these two states
when he puts himself back into
some such condition as that of an
outlaw: the outlaw knows nothing
of the warmth of love and sym
pathy and all that goes to make
life really happy. Lowell says

that by the embers of our losses we
recognize our gains. So it is, we
must have some kind of a mark by
which to gauge our pleasures.
Sometimes, indeed, we count our
losses by lire that our gains make;
and in bewailing our losses we for
get that it is really a cause for
happiness that we ever acquired
those gains which have become the
subject of our present losses.
In my talk before the Christian
Associations Wednesday evening I
emphasized the importance of serv
ing God not as a slave, hoping for
reward, but as gods who will take
no reward. Herein lies the secret
of all happiness. The old primal
hunger of protoplasm is still upon
us, and in order to obtain the re
ward of the poorest and lowest life
one must either feed himself or
have some one else feed him. But
this work of feeding the carnal or
baser self is the work of a slave.
The best part of man's service for
God is that for which lie expects no
reward —love and human sym
pathy, and all that springs there
from. Indeed, we realize no true
happiness except from that which
we have done over and above what
we expect to be paid for. The
more, therefore, we stilie this old,
primal hunger, the happier we shall
be.
For all these incidents and means
of our progress we have an un
qualified right to be thankful, not
only on the 28th day of November,
but on every other day. We are
today only stopping, in our hurry,
to say and do what we should be
saying and doing every day.
"1 know of no more encouraging
fact than the unquestionable
ability of a man to elevate his life
by a conscious endeavor. Jt is
something to be able to paint a
particular picture, or to carve a
statue, and so make a few objects
beautiful, it is far more glorious
to carve and paint the very atmo
sphere through which we look,which
morally we can do." —Thoreau.
Next came a vocal solo: "O rest
in the Lord," Mendelssohn, by Mrs.
A. \\\ Smith.
The closing hymn was "God Save
Our Native Land," sung to the tune
of "America."
