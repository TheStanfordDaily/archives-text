In an account of the Yale-Prince
ton game of last Saturday, Richard
Harding Davis in one connection
said: "Caspar W. Whitney, who
next to Walter Camp knows as
much about football as any other
man in the country, was sitting on
the grass at my right, etc."
The significance of that to us is
that it recalls to us in a forcible
way the greatness of our coach.
We have become so accustomed to
seeing Walter Camp going quietly
about his business of coaching with
no approach to bluster or pre
tense, in fact we see such a small
part of the real coaching, that we
sometimes forget that the father of
football, its strongest friend, the
greatest authority, the greatest
strategist, the greatest coach known
to the game, is here on the campus
looking after our football interests.
So the words of the noted young
author, himself a football man dur
ing his collage days at Lehigh,
placing Caspar Whitney above all
other football authorities, a place
few will deny him, yet below our
coach, awakens us with a start to the
gratitude we owe to Walter Camp;
and thinking of that we forget
Thome's great run.
