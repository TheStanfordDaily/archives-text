# AMONG THE REDWOODS.
## What Our Football Men Are Doing in the Hills, and How They Are Located. 
### 
The Stanford players are
strengthening themselves and per
fecting their game in one of the
most pleasant resorts in the region.
They are stopping at a small settle
ment six miles back of Redwood
City and one mile nearer the sum
mit of the mountains than Wood
side. The location is as inspiring
as could be selected. The small
hotel and "Annex," as the men
call the lesser dormitory, are built
among lofty redwoods and old
oaks.
The air, much cooler than on the
campus, greatly invigorates the
men and had a preceptible effect
on their appetites at once. The
food given them is highly satis
factory and in every way the men
are more comfortably fixed than
they were last year. Owing to the
number of players that were taken
to the mountain —about thirty —
the sleeping quarters are somewhat
crowded.
Saturday morning from nine
o'clock until nearly noon the men
were kept at signal practice. The
evening before a hard practice
game had been played and another
game took place Saturday after
noon. The game Saturday lasted
from 2:80 until dusk and was much
more snappy and vigorous than
any played on the campus. The
interference has decidedly im
proved.
Cochran has been playing tackle
and Weldon fullback. Fisher and
Thomas showed up best at half—
Reynolds, Dole, and Franken
heimer not playing. The latter was
so rapidly getting over his sprained
ankle that he expected to be able to
play a couple of practice games
this week, and as lie had been in all
the signal practice, he would have
been in good shape for the big
game ; but word has come that he
received a slight kick on his ankle
and that now it pains him greatly.
He may not be able to play.
Code and Cotton alternate at
quarter. The latter has not yet
become sure in passing, but in
other respects he shows improve
ment. Jeffs has been putting up
a first-class end. His chief fault
seems to be in overrunning his man,
but the pains he is taking to over
come this fault is having its effect.
The gridiron is covered with
dust, ankle dee}), which at times
almost suffocates the players. Ar
rangements have been made to
keep it sprinkled, however, and
from now on it should be in pretty
fair shape for play.
There are few visitors at the
team's training quarters or to wit
ness the game. A few students
went up Saturday and Sunday to
see the men, but no such crowds as
visited the men a, year ago.
The men are forbidden to wander
any distance from the training
quarters and so find considerable
trouble in amusing themselves.
Reading matter is at a
and so several of the men includ
ing Captain Cochran are becoming
devotees of the game of "ringers."
Holbrook is said to be an adept at
cutting out doll dresses and Fickert
between practice games wishes that

lie could get in another lick at
German or could get an immediate
chance at Berkeley. Bartlett has
been constituted head paper carrier.
