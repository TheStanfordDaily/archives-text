THEUnass meeting in the chapel
last Friday night came near being
a flat failure because some one had
failed to do his duty. An unex
pectedly large crowd was out and en
thusiasm was at lirst unlimited, but
as the audience waited and waited
and no leader put in an appear
ance, interest rapidly waned. But
for the leader and the organist who
at last volunteered, people would
have soon left in disgust and the
remaining meetings for practice
would have been failures through
c 5
lack of attendance.
The blame for this oversight
seems to rest upon the committee
on songs, which called the meeting.
Before tomorrow night's gathering,
called by the same committee, a
leader and an organist should be
found, so that the tiresome delay
may not be repeated.
