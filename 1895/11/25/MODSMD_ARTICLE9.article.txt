Ne< 30TIATI0NS are going on be
tween our debaters and those of the
University of California regarding
Senator Perkins' generous gift to
the speakers of the two universities.
Our representatives have taken the
stand that the offer of such a prize
to the one best man on each side
would he destructive to the unity
of the debate —that the glory of
winning such a prize would, in
some cases, outweigh devotion to
one's alma mater. At present it
looks as though Berkeley is likely
to accede to the view of the matter
entertained here.
We have no desire to criticise
the donor of the prize or to detract
from his generosity, but it certainly
seems the acceptance of the prize
under present conditions would be

injurious to our debating interests.
A debate resembles a football game
in that a combination of individ
uals working together will win
from far better individuals the
work of whom is disjointed. We
had better refuse this prize than to
accept it as it now stands.
