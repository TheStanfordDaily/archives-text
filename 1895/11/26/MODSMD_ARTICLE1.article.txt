## Something About the Men Who Will Battle for the Cardinal. 
### 
For weeks past there has been
the greatest amount of speculation
in regard to the men who will he
chosen to line-up against Butter
worth's long-haired men and hring
down victory for the cardinal. But
the question is just as indefinite
now as it ever was. The problem
which Captain Cochran will have
1 o sol ve is to select out of a number of
possible combinations the one
which will work the best with least
possibility of weak interference,
fumbling, and poor tackling. As it
is, no one perhaps will know the
line-up until the men leave their
quarters at Central Park and come
out upon the field to win or lose.
It is with this explanation that the
following sketches of some of the
most promising candidates are
given.
CAPTAIN COCHttAN.
Without doubt Cochran is the
best all-round player we have; he
plays so well in his old position at
tackle that many have viewed with
alarm the possibility of his being
taken out of the line and put in as
fullback; on the other hand, when
ever he has practiced in the latter
position he has shown himself to he
so valuable in bucking the line and
in tackling opposing runners, that
it is possible that someone else may
be given his old position. Cochran
received his football training at
Lawrenceville Academy, whither he
had gone to prepare for Princeton,
lie entered Stanford in '92 and
played left tackle in the first team
which Walter Camp sent against
Berkeley, and played the same
position in '98 and '94. In the
game last year it was Cochran who
carried the ball over Berkeley's
line and won the game by that
wonderful "fluke." Hehasworked
faithfully this year to get out the
best material available and Stan
ford sympathizers can rest assured
that the men he selects will be
those who are capable of doing the
best work. The difficulties this
year have been at times almost un
surmountable, but we have felt
that our football interests were in
the hands of one whom we could
trust, and it may well be expected
that no one will work harder to
win that game next Thursday than
our Captain.
JULIUS B. FRANKENHEIMER.
The Berkeley men have more
respect for our left halfback than
for any other man on the team,
.lule was born [in Stockton twenty
two years ago and entered the Uni
versity with the Class of '96. Jle
learned all his football here and
succeeded in making the Varsity as
left end in his Freshman year. In
'93 and '94 he played left halfback
and this year has been playing for
the same position. In defensive
work he is probably the most valu
able man on the team. As a line
bucker he can usually be depended
upon to make a gain. .lust now
the most eager inquiries about our
prospects are as to whether he will
be able to play at all; but there is
a general feeling that when time is
called Jule will be on hand. If he
is unable to play, Dole will proba
bly take his place.

JACKSON E. REYNOLDS.
Our other halfback appeared for
the lirst time on the football field i
last year; he played for the position
of right halfback and succeeded in
getting the place which was once
held by Walton. Reynolds excels
in end running and has never
played in a game yet without mak
ing at least one brilliant run; his
speed and weight combine to make
him a strong player. In the Oak
land High School he was recognized
as one of the best athletes and was
the champion runner for the Four
A's. Stanford people expect him
to make use of this speed on Thurs
day and spread consternation
through the Berkeley ranks.
CHARLES M. FICKERT
The man who is expected to break
through Plunket never saw a foot
ball game before coming to Stan
ford. He was born near Bakers
field, and entered the University
with the Class of '97. Last year
he was left guard on the Varsity
and won the game for Stanford by
breaking through and blocking
Ransome's punt. lie is a most ag
gressive player and has more en
durance, perhaps, than any other
man on the team ; even when
playing against heavy odds, Fick
ert never gives up. Our left guard
may be depended on to hold his
own.
NATHAN 1 EL CA RLE.
In all probability Carle, '98. will
play the other guard. He was
born in Portland, and received his
football training in the Seattle
High School, where he played cen
ter for two years. He entered the
University last year two weeks
before the Freshman game, and
was immediately put in as center.
This year he was tried fora while
at center, was changed to tackle,
and has finally been put at guard
where he is doing better work. He
is good in breaking through the
line, but has never had experience
in a hard-fought game. In the
last few days, however, he has
greatly improved and will give a
good account of himself in the
game.
ALFRED B. SPALDING.
As right end we have one of the
surest tacklers on the team. Spald
ing was born in Atchison, Kas.,
and is a member of the Senior ('lass.
He did not play football until '93,
when he came out as a candidate
for one of the end positions. Last
year he played right end and dis
tinguished himself by his clever
tackling and brilliant end-running.
He saved the score for Stanford in
the second half by tackling Sher
man with *uch force that he drop
ped the ball just as he was about
to carry it over our line, Harrelson
falling on the ball and making a
touchback. This year he has been
doing some good work in bucking
the line and rarely fails to wriggle
his way through fora long run.
Berkeley has boasted much of her
lends, but Thursday's game will
show that we have some good ma
terial in that line too.
THOMAS K. CODE.
It is related of our quarterback
i that at the time of the fire in the
' Utica mine last summer, he let
himself down into the shaft by a

rope and was hauled up with a
senseless miner under each arm. 1
This story will serve to illustrate
the coolness and courage which,
characterize Code's playing. lie,
is a native of San Francisco,
and played for two years in the
San Francisco High School;
entered Stanford in 1891, and
played quarterback on the first
team Stanford ever put into the
field. Last year he was prevented
from playing his usual game owing
to an injury, but made substitute
quarterback in spite of that. His
greatest faculty lies in his interfer
ence and in his ability to break up
the interference of the opposing
team.
STEUART W. COTTON.
The youngest man on the team
is Cotton, '98. He played guard
on the Belmont team, but tried
last year for tackle. A few weeks
before Thanksgiving he was
changed to left end and played
that position in the game. This
year he has been tried successively
at end, tackle, and halfback, and
is now a promising candidate for
quarter. His weight makes him
indispensable to the line and his
bucking ability is unquestioned.
THOMAS M. WILLIAMS.
The man who will play the cen
ter position will most likely be
Williams; he was horn twenty
three years ago in West Virginia
and is a member of the Junior
Class. His first experience on the
gridiron was received last year
when he played fora while as cen
ter on the second eleven against
Ilazzard. No one has ever doubted
that he has grit, and theexperience
he had with over a score of "greas
ers" last year at Mazatlan proves
conclusively that he is fully a hie to
take care of himself. Williams
was a member of tlie Zoological
expedition to Mexico and one day
when he found a number of Mexi
cans running over the nets which
had been drawn up on the shore,
picking up the fish and throwing
them about, he rushed down among
them, tossing them right and left,
and seizing one of the principal
offenders used him as a flail
to disperse the rest. From this
time on the inhabitants regarded
Williams with supernatural terror
and attributed to him the name of
"the Gringo Colorado" (the red
headed Yankee); and no one
among all the members of the
expedition was treated with more
respect nor avoided with more con
sideration than the "Gringo Colo
rado."
WILLIAM E. CAMPBELL.
The position of right tackle will
perhaps be filled by Campbell pro
vided he does not receive further
injury. Last year was his first
year at football and he played a
hard game; but this year he has
been unfortunate in practice and
has not been able to play up to his
last year's standard. He will he
able to use his weight and strength
to good advantage, however, in
breaking up Berkeley's interference
and in getting through Ihe line.
CHESTER A. THOMAS.
One of the most promising can
didates for tackle is Thomas, '97.
' He played center and halfback at

Belmont and was substitute guard
on the Varsity in his freshman
year. lie played in the second
half in the game with Chicago last
year and was right guard in the
game with the Los Angeles Athletic
Club. He is a strong, aggressive
player, and has lately shown him
self to be of great service in the
way of breaking through and tack
ling behind the line; his experi
ence at half makes him a reliable
man to trust with the ball, while
his work at guard has taught him
to hold his place in the line. In
case Cochran plays fullback
Thomas will likely get his place
at tackle; and at any rate he will
give Campbell a hard race for his
position.
ALEXANDER S. JEFFS.
In case Cotton should be placed
at quarter, Jeffs will probably be
put at left end; those who have
seen him play will regard this as a
wise move. For he seems to be
absolutely fearless in his playing,
and would do equally well at either
end or as half, lie played one
year in the Pacific University in
Oregon, but has not played here
until this year.
KOY WELDON.
In the game with the Olympics
two weeks ago Weldon surprised
every one by his remarkably good
punting; at one time he made a
punt of fifty-five yards and fol
lowed it up by several others aver
aging at least fifty yards. The
peculiar feature about his kicking
is that lie kicks those long, low,
rakish punts which are so hard to
catch and so difficult to stop. His
baseball experience makes him
thoroughly reliable on making a
catch, and his sprinting record en
ables him to outrun any man on
the field. His chief fault is in
waiting too long after receiving the
i ball, but this is being rapidly over
come. When sent through the
line he can generally be relied
upon to get up on the other side.
This is practically his first year at
football as he played but little in
! his freshman year.
