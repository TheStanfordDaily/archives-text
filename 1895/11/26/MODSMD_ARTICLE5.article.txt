If there is one person more than
any other who deserves our sincere
gratitude for the faithful services
rendered to the student body, it is
the reliable old friend of the foot
ball men who day after day for
more than two months has at
tended carefully to our football
field, and has had everything in
first-class shape for the team's
practice. True, lie was employed
to do the work and will, of course,
in the end receive pay for it, but
he has not as yet. Under the cir
cumstances the loyalty of the man
and his faith in the honor of the
student body are remarkable, for
we all know that the funds of that
organization have been far from
plentiful this year, and a promise
to pay is at best but vague and in
tangible. Not many men would
have done the same thing in his
position.
