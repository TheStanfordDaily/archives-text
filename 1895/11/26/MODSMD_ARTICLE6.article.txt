The Chronicle this morning has
a very long article in which Berke
ley men are said to be accusing
Stanford, and especially the Stan
ford football management, of all
kinds of trickery and double deal
ing in the matter of the intercol
legiate agreement by which Simp
son, Hall, and Garton are debarred
from playing. There is a pos
sibility that the Berkeley student
body does not endorse the views in
this article, that it is only the ex
pression of the spleen of a few
over-zealous adherents of the blue
and gold.
However, there are many indica
tions that Berkeley men are dis
gruntled because they are appar
ently the losers by this agreement
instead of their rivals. The claim
that the agreement was not meant
to apply to football is absurd and
childish. It is utterly unreason
able to suppose that any athletic
agreement could be formed leaving
out of consideration the most im
portant branch of intercollegiate
sports.
Our management had feared
from the first that Garton would
fall under the head of special stud
ents and had no intention to play
him in that case, long before his
knee was hurt or it was known that
Simpson would be similarly de
barred. The whole thing is only
an indication of what may be ex
pected of Berkeley if she loses.

There is one tiling that we
should bear in mind iis individuals
and as a body after the game
Thursday. The action of every in
dividual student will reflect credit
or discredit upon the University.
The decent behavior of hundreds
will pass unnoticed, while a single
ungentlemanly act by any man
wearing the cardinal will be sure to
attract notice and comment. The
San Francisco public will be very
quick to magnify any misconduct
on our part. We know what kind
of treatment to expect at the hands
of the newspapers. The doings of
a dozen thoughtless, boisterous fel
lows may inspire columns of invec
tive against the orgies of Stanford
students.
The gentlemanly instincts of the
great majority of the students will
keep them from anything unbecom
ing. But it also rests with this
majority to see that the few who
are not actuated by the same in
stincts do not bring shame upon
the whole University. They should
be made to feel that any carousal on
this particular night brands them
not only as lacking the qualities of
gentlemen, but as being devoid of
the spirit of loyalty to the Univer
sity as well.
There is another phase to the
question. As last year, many
hoodlums will masquerade under our
colors, hoping to gain immunity
through the clemency supposed to
be shown to college students, for acts
that otherwise would bring down
the strong arm of the law upon
them. There are two ways to deal
with this class. Either take the
colors off such fellows by force, as
two of our professors did last year
with a south of Market tough, or
point them out to the police. By
actively disclaiming the misguided
enthusiasm of city sympathizers of
doubtful character we can hope to
escape some of the odium that may
otherwise attach to us.
The interests of the University
and the future welfare of football
demand these things. As gentle
men, as enthusiasts for this sport,
as Stanford students, we should re
member them.
