The American School at Athens
has published as its fourth bulletin
a report on (he work and aims of
the school, by Professor J. W.
White, recently professor of Greek
language and literature here.
Since the institution was founded,
thirteen years ago, the managing
committee has received for its yearly
expenses, mainly from annual sub
scriptions from the supporting col
leges, $660,044.53 (including $5,-
000 which was contributed by the
Archaeological Institute of America
toward the excavations at the
Heraem). A permanent endow
ment of about $50,000 has been se
cured and the value of real estate
which it owns in Athens is esti
mated at $35,000.
There have been thirteen differ
ent directors and professors at the
school, representing ten universities
and colleges at home, and the
school has had sixty students.
These students received their first
degree in thirty-ore different Ameri
can institutions of learning; thirty
eight of them have received higher
degrees; twenty-six have received
the degree of Doctor of Philosophy,
conferred at seven universities in
America and live in Europe; forty
nine are or have been teachers,
thirty with the rank of professor,
in forty-two institutions of learning
in the United States.
Professor White describes briefly
the work which the school has car
ried on, including the unearthed
theatre at Thoricus, "one of the
most important and oldest of the
(Jreek theaters which the excava
tions of tifteen years have brought
to light"; he also offers some sug
gestions for the improvement of the
organization and conduct of the
school. He favorstheexistingplan
of a director with live years' re
sidence in Greece, and recommends
two annual professors instead of
one, as at present. His suggestion
that the Archaeology Institute
found two fellowships of $600 a
year, to be tilled by competitive ex
amination and held for twoorthree
years, has already been adopted,
and the following have been ap
pointed fellows for the present
academic year: Frank C. Babbitt,
