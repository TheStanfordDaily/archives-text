# STANFORD'S FUTURE HEROES.
## The 						Men of the Second Eleven, Who Will Form Next Year's Varsity. 
### 
One of the best things Walter
Camp has done this year has been
to build up a strong second eleven.
For, as he says, the prime need of
a University team is plenty of
material to draw from; it means
not the victory of one year, but of
the years to come. Each year we
have gone about forming a Varsity
team without making any provis
ion for the team of the following
year, and the result has been that
the captain and coach found 011
their hands at the beginning of
each year a few Varsity players
and over a score of new, inexper
ienced men from which to form a
team. Next year, however, we
shall not find ourselves in such a
helpless condition.
The men who have played on the
second eleven this year are deserv
ing of the highest credit for their
faithful attention to practice and
for the care they have taken that
no man should lie placed 011 the
Varsity who had not earned his
place.
Charles L. Dole, '98, will go up
as sub-half. 1 le was born in Hono
lulu and prepared for the Univer
sity in the Riverside High School.
He was made captain of the Fresh
man team and played left halfback
in the game with the Berkeley fresh
men. He also played at Los
Angeles in the games with Chicago
and the Los Angeles Athletic Club.
As a line-smasher and ground
gainer he is excelled by few, but
has been prevented from system
atic training this year owing to an
injury received in the first few
weeks of practice.
Forrest S. Fisher, '98, will be
the other substitute at halfback.
He hails from Oregon and ap
peared for the first time on the
gridiron three weeks ago. His
weight and strength, however, make
up for his lack of experience. He
weighs 173 pounds.
Edwin James, substitute tackle,
never played football until this
year; he entered with the Class of
'97 as a student in engineering.
He has won his place by hard, con
scientious work.
John B. Rice will be the other
substitute tackle; he came to the
University in 1893 without any
football training and played center
011 the second eleven. That was
the year Bliss coached the team,
when mass plays were still in vogue
and it was the duty of the center
man to stop the fiying wedge. It
was a hard experience fora new
man, and it is certain that no one
rejoiced more over the change than
he did. Last year Rice was made
substitute tackle and this year he
has been playing a strong game.
He will hold his own with any of
the others.
Charles R. Lewers, who will be
sub-center, is another new man;
he came out at the beginning of
the year and showed a remarkable
aptitude for the game. Nothing
but inexperience has kept him from
making the Varsity.
William S. Harrington was born
in San Jose and received his foot
ball training in the Oakland High
School. He played last year in'

the contest with the Berkeley fresh
men, and was tried fora while this
year at tackle; he was prevented
from practicing regularly, however,
owing to an injury received in one
of the games with Reliance. He
will go as sub-guard.
William P. Mcintosh is captain
of the Freshman team and has
played at quarter on the second
eleven. He is plucky and full of
grit and a sure tackier. His ex
perience was gained on the Los
Angeles Athletic Club team.
Harry Reynolds has suffered
more than any other player we
have; last year he was injured
early in the season and was com
pelled to abandon football, and
again this year when he was almost
sure of a place he was hurt again.
He seems too good a man to lose
and may still be able to play in
case of emergency. The great
feature of his style of play is his
end running.
Benjamin Thomas is twenty
three years old arid never played
until this year. He learned the
game rapidly, however, and has
played most of the time on the
second eleven where there is 110 in
terference. He belongs to the
junior class.
Evans Holbrook, '97, played two
years as quarterback at the Uni
versity of Michigan. He has been
unfortunate this year in having
sprained an ankle over a month
ago which has not ceased to trouble
him. He plays a strong game at
either end or quarter.
M. B. Leavitt belongs to the soph
omore class and is a native of this
State. He played two years as
left tackle at Peddie Institute, near
Princeton College, and last year
played in the Freshman team
against Berkeley. His playing is
rapid and aggressive; as end he
plays perhaps his best game.
Charles R. Frazier played tackle
in the Multnomah (Or.) team
against Stanford two }'ears ago.
He makes a capital fullback, and
except for an injury last year
would have been a strong candi
date. He is a member of '98.
Edwin G. Robinson entered the
University last year as a sopho
more from the University of Ten
nessee, where his football training
was received. He weighs 175
pounds and is twenty-one years old.
Paul A. Adams was born in Bos
ton, Mass. He never saw a foot
ball field before coming to Stan
ford last year. In the three weeks
that he has been out this year he
has played exceedingly well and
should be a strong candidate next
year.
11. R. Plate is one of the best
players of the Freshman team ; he
played fora while on the second
eleven of the Olympic team, and
since coming to Stanford has
played half on the second eleven.
An injury received a week ago has
laid him on the shelf for this year,
but he promises to be on hand for
next year's struggle.
M. J. Overacker was captain of
the Centerville team last year and
played fullback fora while on the
second eleven; in the Freshman
game he played left half.
Ray Smith played right half in
the Freshman game and left end a
while on the second eleven.
