Those who have been working
faithfully this semester will have
a double reason for being thankful
tomorrow ; for the time of their re
ward is now drawing near and
they will be spared some of the
drudgery and cramming of the
next few weeks. Those who have
been indifferent heretofore and who
are just awakening to the precar
iousness of their position may still
retrieve themselves by hard study.
It is to be hoped that the exper
iences of uneasiness and mortifica
tion they are about to pass through
will break many of them forever of
the pernicious habit of procrastina
tion.
