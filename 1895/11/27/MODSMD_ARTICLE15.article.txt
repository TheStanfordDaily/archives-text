Tomorrow afternoon the result
of three months'training will bring
us either victory or defeat. Every
thing that could be done to prepare
our men for the contest has been
done; all they need now is a proper
manifestation of enthusiasm on the
part of the students to cheer them
on to victory and fill them with
determination to do their best.
Without such support, defeat is in
evitable; with it, no one can tell
what the score may be.
In case of victory, let us use
moderation in our celebration, not
forgetting the courtesy due our de
feated rivals, and remembering
that upon our conduct tomorrow
night rests the honor of the Uni
versity.
Should Berkeley win, it will not
do for us to lose heart; by our at
tendance and enthusiasm at the
Vaudeville let us show our loyalty
to the Stanford colors, our faith in
the Stanford spirit, and our glory
in the hope of victory to come.
