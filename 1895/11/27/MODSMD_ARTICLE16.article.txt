This is the season when students
are apt to fall into the dangerous
practice of over-drawing their allow
ances and calling upon their com
panions for help when they
become " short." If you can afford
the expenditures you make, it is
just as easy to have your checks
sent in time as not; if you cannot
afford them, do not make the mis
take of calling upon your fellows
to pay for you when you have gone
beyond your means. Loaning
money to students is seldom justi
fiable or a benefit to the borrower.
It often leads to the expenditure of
money which was altogether un
necessary and could not be afforded,
and causes needless embarassment
to the borrower or lender, or both.
"Pay as you go" is a good motto
in college as well as elsewhere.
Debt is a great curse which is re
sponsible for much misery and
worry. You may consider your
self unfortunate if you cannot keep
pace with those around you, but it
is much better to lie able to keep
one's expenses within one's means
than to lie a high-flyer at another's
expense. The only hope for the
poor student is a clear conscience,
an honest heart, and lofty aims
raising him above his surroundings.
If he yields to the temptation to go
beyond bis depth, he is hopelessly
lost.
