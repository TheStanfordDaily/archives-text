Down in Baltimore a new use
was discovered for footballists at
the late joyful election. There was
one ward where Democratic thugs
were awed. Boss (Jorman in his
younger days was an enthusiastic
athlete, and was a. member of the
first Washington baseball team.
But in Baltimore the young ath
letes were enlisted in support of
the Republican ticket. The foot
ball phalanx which was sent as a
committee to the first precinct of
the second ward held the fort.
Although there were about forty
live crooked names on the list to
be voted upon, and while the ring's
agents had plenty of repeaters in
the immediate neighborhood of the
polling place, the stalwart front of
the committee seemed to overawe
the toughs, and only once was an
attempt made to vote one of the
fraudulent names. This happened
in the morning, and the suspected
repeater was promptly spotted —Mr.
William Riggs, chairman of the
committee, pushing his stout form
into the room, demanded that the
vote be challenged. The ma*n was
made to swear that he was the man
he claimed to be, and that he lived
where he said he did. Then begot
his vote, but the vigilance of the
reform league people had
thoroughly frightened him, and his
fear was imparted to the rest of the
gang, for not another repeater en
tered the polling place during the
remainder of the (lay.
No doubt the personnel of this
committee had much to do with
the unusual respect they com
manded from the toughs: William
lliggs, who for several years played
guard on the Princeton team
against Yale's giant player, Heffel
tinger; Alfred Biggs, also a Prince
ton foot ha Hist; Allan McLane, who
is an athlete of all-round reputa
tion in Baltimore; Markham Mar
shall, who has figured on the ath
letic field for the University of
Virginia; William Lehr, and John
Pleasants, each of whom is of for
midable size.
It was seldom that members of
the committee were offerred the
slightest verbal affront, and they
were never physically assaulted.
When the part) 7 first made its ap
pearance at the polls, a little before
six o'clock in the morning, there
was a crowd gathered around the
place. It scattered, though, as the
delegation came up. — Orange
