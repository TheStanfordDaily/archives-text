# THAT UNLUCKY SECOND HALF.
## Berkeley Ties Stanford's Score in the Last Five Minutes of Play. 
### 
The '"Big Game" has been played
and Stanford still holds the record
of never having been beaten by the
University of California. The
wearers of the cardinal have met
the striped stockings from across
the bay live times and never has
the cardinal been lowered before
the blue and gold.
The great game of Thanksgiving
day, 1895, will go down into his
tory as a hard-fought battle in
which U. C., chiefly through the
individual efforts of Ransome and
Sherman, was able to tie the score
against the fine team work and
strategic playing of Stanford.
The elements were against the
Palo Alto boys and it wasanuphill
battle all through the second half.
The rain soaked the ground and
made the ball so soggy as to ruin
Stanford's chances of gaining either
by punting or by trick plays. At
one point of the game Spalding,
aided by the excellent interference
of Reynolds, passed the whole U.C.
team and had a clean Held
before him, but just as everyone
expected him to score a, touchdown,
he slipped and fell and in an
instant was pounced upon by a fog
belt tackier.
In the second half, Stanford
failed to make the same showing as
in the early part of the struggle.
It seems to he the rule that, no
matter how well trained and
coached the Stanford team may be,
the last part of the game goes
against them. On Thursday, our
men were either worn out or else
they felt too much confidence in
themselves, for they seemed un
able to withstand the onslaught of
their adversaries. The score might
have been different had Stanford
kept the ball in the last few mo
ments of play.
Undoubtedly Ransome's playing
was the saving point on the Berke
ley side, although he was ably as
sisted by Capt. Sherman. The
only point in which Ransome out
played Cochran was in punting.
11 is punts were long and sure but
he showed himself very weak in
catching a punted ball and fumbled
time after time. In defensive work,
Cochran outshone any of the other
men. At several critical points it
was his tackling that saved the day
for Stanford.
It is difficult to pick out any one
man from the Stanford side for
special praise, for they all played
splendidly and, as a team, they
worked together like a machine.
The best gains were made by
Spalding, Reynolds, and Cochran.
Frankenheimer was badly handi
capped by his sprained ankle and
although he did some excellent
work he failed to make any brilli
ant gains.
The rain began to fall early in
the day, but it seemed impossible
to keep the crowds from Central
Park. "Shortly after noon throngs
of people began to move toward
Eighth and Market streets, and by
two o'clock the stands on the east
and west sides of the field were
packed with people, while hundreds
crowded the nearby housetops. The
unsheltered sections on the east

side were reserved for the Stanford
and Berkeley students.
At 2:20, just as the Stanford
team entered the grounds, the rain
began to fall rather heavily. In
an instant the bleachers took on
the appearance of beds of great
black mushrooms, for every posses
sor of an umbrella immediately
brought it into use.
The U. C. team followed the
Stanford men after a few moments.
About 2:30 Governor Budd and
party drove up to the Park, and as
they entered the grounds were
greeted by cheers, first from Stan
ford and then from Berkeley.
The canvas-clad Berkelevans ran
on the field at 2:81, followed closely
by the boys in the• red sweaters.
The teams went through signal
practice fora few minutes.
There was a great deal of differ
ence in the appearance of the teams.
Several of the Berkeley men had
bandaged heads, and their suits
were old and ragged. The Stan
ford team made a very tine appear
ance with its eleven men clad in
bright red sweaters with black in
itials, and with stockings to match.
Sherman wins the toss and
chooses the south goal.
Carle places the ball at the center
of the field and, at 2: 41, drives the
1 ball well into the Berkeley terri
tory. Hupp catches the ball and
carries it back ten yards, when he
is tackled.

Then the teams face each other
in close quarters for the first time
this year. Men who had met each
other in the struggles of former
years renewed their acquaintance,
while the newer players face each
other for the first time. Thus the
strife begins.
Ransome takes the ball and goes
around his left end for three yards
and follows it up with a gain of two
yards. He then punts to Stan
ford's thirty-five-yard line.
Cochran catches the ball and
makes a small gain. Jack Rey
nolds forces the ball through the
U. C. line for three yards. Spald
ing circles Wilson's end and his
interference enables him to pass
everyone but Ransome, who man
ages to down him after a run of
twenty-one yards. Then the Stan
ford rooters send up a shout as they
see the ball resting on U. C.'s thirty
yard line and our men playing
faster ball than Berkeley. Fickert
is proving himself more than a
match for "that giant Plunkett,"
Campbell is holding the much
lauded Douglas and, in fact, Prof.
Camp's class is pushing the Berke
leyites along. Code gains two
yards on the "Tehachipi pass,"
getting the ball from Fickert and
running through Reinhardt. Coch
ran follows through the tackle for
one yard. Cochran gives the sig
nal fora kick but the punt is
spoiled by a bad pass and Code

tries to fall on the ball but fumbles
it and Hupp captures the pig-skin
with a loss of twenty yards to Stan
ford.
The ball is on U. C.'s forty-five
yard line. Hupp tries a run around
the end but only gains one and
one half yards. Berkeley tries to
go through Campbell but loses a
half yard, Ransome tries Stan
ford's right end and gains three
yards. Stanford's ball on downs.
Fickert and Campbell make a
' hole for Reynolds and he gains
over two yards. Spalding is given
the ball and dashes around the left
end and with good interference
passes everybody but Ransome,
who again downs him but not until
he has left twenty-live yards of
Berkeley territory behind him.
Frankenheimer loses two yards and
the ball rests on U.C.'s twenty-four
yard line. Cochran goes through
Plunkett for two and a half yards.
Third down. Cochran punts to the
fifteen-yard line. Williams shows
j the kind of stuff he is made of and

j C.'s six-yard line. Frankenheimer
bucks the center for two yards and
! Cochran makes two yards, but the
I ball is taken back two yards be
j cause the center had pushed it

j yard of the goal. Then Cochran
I by a similar play downs the ball
j across the line just twelve and one
half minutes from the call of time.
The touchdown is made squarely
; between the goal posts and Code
I carries the ball out and holds it.
j Cochran stands for a few moments,
with a determined look tin his face,
| and then after a careful aiming
I drives the ball over the goal in a
j good clean manner.
The Stanford sympathizers are
wild with delight, and a mighty
i shout goes up. The Berkeley peo
j pie are decidedly glum, and the
j vast amount of confidence which
! they have shown before the game
seems to have disappeared.
Ransome kicks off for twenty-five
yards, and the pig-skin rolls to the
twenty-live-yard line, where Frank
enheimer downs it.

and time is called for the first half
with the ball in that position.
Ransome kicks off at the begin
ning of the second half. Spalding
runs the ball back seventeen yards.

The '"Big Game" has been played
and Stanford still holds the record
of never having been beaten by the
University of California. The
wearers of the cardinal have met
the striped stockings from across
the bay live times and never has
the cardinal been lowered before
the blue and gold.
The great game of Thanksgiving
day, 1895, will go down into his
tory as a hard-fought battle in
which U. C., chiefly through the
individual efforts of Ransome and
Sherman, was able to tie the score
against the fine team work and
strategic playing of Stanford.
The elements were against the
Palo Alto boys and it wasanuphill
battle all through the second half.
The rain soaked the ground and
made the ball so soggy as to ruin
Stanford's chances of gaining either
by punting or by trick plays. At
one point of the game Spalding,
aided by the excellent interference
of Reynolds, passed the whole U.C.
team and had a clean Held
before him, but just as everyone
expected him to score a, touchdown,
he slipped and fell and in an
instant was pounced upon by a fog
belt tackier.
In the second half, Stanford
failed to make the same showing as
in the early part of the struggle.
It seems to he the rule that, no
matter how well trained and
coached the Stanford team may be,
the last part of the game goes
against them. On Thursday, our
men were either worn out or else
they felt too much confidence in
themselves, for they seemed un
able to withstand the onslaught of
their adversaries. The score might
have been different had Stanford
kept the ball in the last few mo
ments of play.
Undoubtedly Ransome's playing
was the saving point on the Berke
ley side, although he was ably as
sisted by Capt. Sherman. The
only point in which Ransome out
played Cochran was in punting.
11 is punts were long and sure but
he showed himself very weak in
catching a punted ball and fumbled
time after time. In defensive work,
Cochran outshone any of the other
men. At several critical points it
was his tackling that saved the day
for Stanford.
It is difficult to pick out any one
man from the Stanford side for
special praise, for they all played
splendidly and, as a team, they
worked together like a machine.
The best gains were made by
Spalding, Reynolds, and Cochran.
Frankenheimer was badly handi
capped by his sprained ankle and
although he did some excellent
work he failed to make any brilli
ant gains.
The rain began to fall early in
the day, but it seemed impossible
to keep the crowds from Central
Park. "Shortly after noon throngs
of people began to move toward
Eighth and Market streets, and by
two o'clock the stands on the east
and west sides of the field were
packed with people, while hundreds
crowded the nearby housetops. The
unsheltered sections on the east

side were reserved for the Stanford
and Berkeley students.
At 2:20, just as the Stanford
team entered the grounds, the rain
began to fall rather heavily. In
an instant the bleachers took on
the appearance of beds of great
black mushrooms, for every posses
sor of an umbrella immediately
brought it into use.
The U. C. team followed the
Stanford men after a few moments.
About 2:30 Governor Budd and
party drove up to the Park, and as
they entered the grounds were
greeted by cheers, first from Stan
ford and then from Berkeley.
The canvas-clad Berkelevans ran
on the field at 2:81, followed closely
by the boys in the• red sweaters.
The teams went through signal
practice fora few minutes.
There was a great deal of differ
ence in the appearance of the teams.
Several of the Berkeley men had
bandaged heads, and their suits
were old and ragged. The Stan
ford team made a very tine appear
ance with its eleven men clad in
bright red sweaters with black in
itials, and with stockings to match.
Sherman wins the toss and
chooses the south goal.
Carle places the ball at the center
of the field and, at 2: 41, drives the
1 ball well into the Berkeley terri
tory. Hupp catches the ball and
carries it back ten yards, when he
is tackled.

Then the teams face each other
in close quarters for the first time
this year. Men who had met each
other in the struggles of former
years renewed their acquaintance,
while the newer players face each
other for the first time. Thus the
strife begins.
Ransome takes the ball and goes
around his left end for three yards
and follows it up with a gain of two
yards. He then punts to Stan
ford's thirty-five-yard line.
Cochran catches the ball and
makes a small gain. Jack Rey
nolds forces the ball through the
U. C. line for three yards. Spald
ing circles Wilson's end and his
interference enables him to pass
everyone but Ransome, who man
ages to down him after a run of
twenty-one yards. Then the Stan
ford rooters send up a shout as they
see the ball resting on U. C.'s thirty
yard line and our men playing
faster ball than Berkeley. Fickert
is proving himself more than a
match for "that giant Plunkett,"
Campbell is holding the much
lauded Douglas and, in fact, Prof.
Camp's class is pushing the Berke
leyites along. Code gains two
yards on the "Tehachipi pass,"
getting the ball from Fickert and
running through Reinhardt. Coch
ran follows through the tackle for
one yard. Cochran gives the sig
nal fora kick but the punt is
spoiled by a bad pass and Code

tries to fall on the ball but fumbles
it and Hupp captures the pig-skin
with a loss of twenty yards to Stan
ford.
The ball is on U. C.'s forty-five
yard line. Hupp tries a run around
the end but only gains one and
one half yards. Berkeley tries to
go through Campbell but loses a
half yard, Ransome tries Stan
ford's right end and gains three
yards. Stanford's ball on downs.
Fickert and Campbell make a
' hole for Reynolds and he gains
over two yards. Spalding is given
the ball and dashes around the left
end and with good interference
passes everybody but Ransome,
who again downs him but not until
he has left twenty-live yards of
Berkeley territory behind him.
Frankenheimer loses two yards and
the ball rests on U.C.'s twenty-four
yard line. Cochran goes through
Plunkett for two and a half yards.

fifteen-yard line. Williams shows
