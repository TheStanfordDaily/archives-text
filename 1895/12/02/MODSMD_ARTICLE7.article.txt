Some Berkeley enthusiasts are
claiming that the fact that the ball
was in Stanford territory a larger
part of the time is proof of Berk
eley's superior play. The public
credits our men with much the
better team work, and rightly at
tributes Berkeley's success in mak
ing a tie of it to Ransome's great
punting and running.
The truth of the latter view of it
has been tacitly recognized by the
students of each university.
Thanksgiving morning Berkeley
men confidently expected to win.
Only a few Stanford men had
faith in the superiority of our own
team. But when the two elevens
appeared on the field in the pre
liminary signal practice, the con
trast was plainly to the disadvan
tage of the blue and gold.
If any doubt remained as to the
superior training and condition of
our men it was removed by the
first few minutes of play. Berk
eley gave up hope of winning. So
when in the last minutes of the
last half their team tied the score
>
they rejoiced as if over a victory.
Taking into consideration that
they were confident before the game
and we were the opposite, it is
scarcely logical that they should be
so happy over a tie and we so
chagrined, if their team played the
better game.

One of the most gratifying phases
of last Thursday's game to college
men was the favorable comment
that it provoked on all sides. The
style of the game played by the two
teams, the fairness in general of
the men, and the conduct of the
students of the universities, won a
host of friends for football. Many
who attended ready to join the
chorus against the game as a brutal
sport went home enthusiastic advo
cates of it.
A few extracts from the editorial
columns of the city papers illus
trate the favorable impression given
by the Thanksgiving day contest.
The Examiner said Friday morn
ing in a quarter-column editorial:
The result of yesterday's game
will key up the interest to a higher
pitch than ever next year. The
public understands that whatever
the colleges may be able to do with
the athletic clubs, they have their
hands full when they tackle each
other, and no one-sided result is
possible. When Greek meets Greek,
ten thousand people will insist on
seeing the argument fought out, if
they have to sit under shower
baths to do it.
The Saturday Call said:
It is evident that if Berkeley and
Stanford wish to win victories at
football they must send their teams
East.
And again:
If Harvard objects to Stanford
wearing the crimson, she should
send a football team out here and
show whether she can do more
in honor of the color than Stanford
can.
The force of this is somewhat
vitiated by the fact that our color
is not crimson and that Harvard
does not object, but the spirit of it
is good.
The Chronicle contained this in
its Saturday's issue:
A tie game of football between
the University of California and
the Leland Stanford Jr. University,
with a score of six to six, means
not only two well-matched teams,
but pretty good playing. On the
day on which the inter-university
game was played Pennsylvania de
feated Cornell by 24 to 2, Butte
beat the Olympics by 24 to 0, and
Michigan beat Chicago by 12 to (5.
In view of these scores our univer
sity contest was certainly creditable
to both sides.
