# ROBLE INVADES ENCINA.
## A 						Thanksgiving: Dinner Given By the Men of Encina to the Roble Girls. 
### 
Last evening there was given a
reception and Thanksgiving dinner
at Encina which was unique in the
history of the University, and es
tablishes a precedent that promises
to become very popular in the
future. The idea of the affair grew
out of a feeling that there lias not
been a sufficient sentiment of com
radeship among the students.
Through Mr. Tate's kindness it
was made possible to plan fora.
big dinner, and the preliminary
reception was arranged.
The lobby of Encina was de
corated with draperies and potted
plants, while about the pillars
vines were gracefully festooned.
Roble was invited over as a body
and nearly all the boarders in that
dormitory took advantage of the
invitation. The committee had
provided buses and carriages for
the conveyance of the ladies. A
number of faculty members were
present with their wives. Covers
were laid for more than three hun
dred people, and at seven o'clock
the dining-room was filled.
The following menu was served:
Chicken giblet stew
Celery Olives
Shrimp salad
Boiled Columbia river salmon, egg
sauce
Roast turkey, stuffed
Cranberry sauce
Sweet potatoes Cauliflower
Mince pie
Lemon water ice
Nuts and raisins Assorted cakes
Fruit
Cafe.
Toastmaster 11. I). Sheldon in a
very neat speech called on Presi
dent Jordan to speak to the toast,
"The Future of the University.''
Dr. Jordan kept his audience in
;t ripple of laughter as he illustrated
how hard it was to start the toasts
oji such ait occasion as the present,
lie said that it was very easy for
those who followed him after he
had removed all asperities in the
way to tell good jokes, as Prof.
Smith might do, etc. The Presi
dent then emphasized how greatly
the patriotism and loyal feeling
in the I'niversity had been brought
about by the work of Mrs. Stanford.
He related incidents from the past
as showing tin; devotedness and
goodness of heart of Mrs. Stanford.
As to the future, Dr. Jordan said it
must be judged from the past. If
t he government suit should be ended
in .January, that would remove one
great hindrance to the enlarge
ment of the I'niversity and to com
pleting and adding new depart
ments. But there would never be
a time when loyal sentimentamong
the students would not be a great
sustaining power of the institution.
Prof. Stillman toasted "Mrs.
Stanford" itnd told how much was
owing to her.
Prof. A. W. Smith in a very
witty manner spoke on "A Neg
lected Factor in Education," which
be termed nonsense, and advocated
the establishment of a chair fora
study of the appreciation of non
sense.

Capt. Cochran toasted "Our Foot
ball Team" in a very feeling man
ner, complimenting them on their
loyalty and their hard work to win
the last game.
. "Roble" was responded to by
Miss Fielder and ''Encina" by F. L.
Entler.
Prof. Abbott closed the toasts
with "This Dinner," in which he
encouraged such informal dinners
on the ground that they brought
about a closer feeling of sympathy
among students, and supplied a
factor hitherto lacking in the social
life of manv collegians.
