Now that the dust of the battle
h:is cleared off the football field of
1895, we may look back upon a
season favorable to the game and
to amateur sport in general. At
the end of the season of '94 several
unfortunately rough games—the
Yale-Harvard in particular—had
given rise to a strong feeling of
antagonism in various quarters;
some university faculties even went
so far as to prohibit football en
tirely. It was generally felt that
this season was to determine the
future of the sport.
The result has been most satis
factory. Injuries have been com
paratively slight, there have been
no squabbles at all over the results
of games, and very few cases of
slugging. The new rules have

done all that was claimed for them
in opening the play and equalizing
skill with strength, and the players
have attended to a thing which no
rule could ever touch —the gentle
manly conduct of the game.
