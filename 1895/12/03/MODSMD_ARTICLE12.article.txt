Our enterprising contemporary,
the Berkeley an, scorns to follow the
ordinary newspaper plan of send
ing one of its own staff to report
football games. It has a method
of its own. The account of the de
tails of the Thanksgiving day
game, as published in yesterday's
Berkeleyan, was taken almost bodily
from last Friday's Chronicle. The
blue pencil was used somewhat
freely to cut the latter's article
down to fit the space available in
the college paper, but otherwise no
change was made. Even the mis
takes in names and in facts that
occurred in the Chronicle's account
were let stand. For instance,
Campbell was given the credit of
making our touchdown and Carle
of kicking the goal.
The substance, the plan, and the
phraseology of the two articles are
identical. This kind of newspaper
enterprise has certain merits. It
saves expense, time, and labor,
leaving all the members of the staff
free to enjoy the fine points of the
game, unhindered by the task of
note-taking. Nevertheless, it is
a method generally condemned by
reputable papers everywhere.
