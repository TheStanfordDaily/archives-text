The local contest for places on
the intercollegiate Carnot medal de
bate is scheduled to be held next
Friday night. At onetime a suf
ficient number of debaters had sig
nilied their intention to compete.
But for various reasons one after
another has dropped out until now
three names are left on the list.
As this is the number of speakers
allowed each university on the in
tercollegiate contest, these three
will be sure of places.
This deplorable state of affairs is
due to several causes, the chief of
which is the pressure of University
work at this particular time. Berk
eley will not hold her contest until
after the vacation, thus giving
many an opportunity to enter who
could not if it was held as early as
ours.
There seems to be 110 good reason
why the Stanford contest should
not be postponed to the first week
of next semester. A few more at
least have signified their willing
ness to contest in that case. Some
thing must be done to arouse
enough local interest in the debate
to insure Stanford a good represen
tative set of speakers. The Carnot
medal is one of the most desirable
trophies to be won by any college
student, and the'present apathy is
certainly not due to indifference to
the glory of winning it, but to
other causes which may be re
moved.
