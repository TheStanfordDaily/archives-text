# Bench and Bar.

### 
Bench and Bar met Monday
evening. The Court gave a unani
mous decision in favor of defendant
in the case of Flaherty vs. Morgan.
This was a case in which the de
fendant erected a fence on the line
between his lot and the lot owned
by Flaherty. The sole object in
erecting the fence was to spite Fla
herty by cutting off the light from
the latter'sÂ»windows.
After the decision a case was
argued by C. 11. Lewers for
plaintiff, and ft. W. Charles for de
fendant. The case involved the
question of a mutual mistake of
fact in contract.
