# THANKSGIVING VAUDEVILLE.
## Bush Street Theater Crowded — A Great Success. 
### 
The Thanksgiving night Vaude
ville given l>y and under the man
agement of Stanford students, was
all that could be desired in the
way of a financial and artistic suc
cess. To all who witnessed the en
tertainment it was evident that
our University is possessed of no
mean executive and dramatic tal
ent, and that she is able to hold her
own with the best of them in the
line of amateur performances. The
program as a whole was a little
long and somewhat tiresome to
those who were weary with the ex
citing events of the afternoon, al
though it was less the fault of the
management than the enthusiasm
of the audience, who vociferously
applauded each act and compelled
the participants to respond
to repeated encores. The liv
ing pictures should have been
left out, for they were not needed
to contribute to the success of the
evening and were in no wise suited
to a college entertainment.
A very neat and artistic souvenir
program in cardinal had been got
ten up for the occasion and each
person in the house was presented
with one of them.
Long before the time for the en
tertainment to commence, the Bush
street theater, with the exception of
the upper gallery, was completely
filled with enthusiastic Stanford
adherents who occupied the time
before the rise of the curtain in
"joshing," shouting the Stanford
yell, and cheering the members of
the football team and Walter
Camp. The curtain was rung up
on a minstrel scene which sparkled
throughout with lively dancing,
witty gags, and excellent singing.
The solos of I'. F. Abbott, '98, and
Frank (Joftin were especially com
mendatory, and the song "When
the Days Grow Longer," by Chas.
Dillon, '98, one of the end men, re
ceived a well deserved encore.
During the intermission the
Stanford Orchestra, which rendered
all the music for the occasion,
played the overture from "Prince
Ananias," and in such a manner
as to win hearty applause from the
audience. All their music was of
a high order, and would have done
credit to many a professional or
ganization. The second act opened
upon the Vaudeville proper. "An
nie Laurie" was excellently ren
dered by the 1 ilee Club and they
were obliged to respond to an em
phatic encore, which was equally
as pleasing. The " Danse de Gaite"
by W. M. Mcintosh, '97, as Fraulein
von Pumpernickel was very clever
ly executed; and the trio, "Three
Old Fakes from Berkeley Campus,"
with its witty jibes and sarcastic
allusions to our esteemed contem
porary, was thoroughly enjoyed by
all. The "re-appearance of the
favorite pioneers—!he Bakersfield
Brothers," Shirley Baker, and
C. K. Field, '95, waa hailed with
delight by the audience, and their
duet "In the Cold. Cold World,'" was
one of the best numbers on the
program. "Stanford University
March," by the Mandolin Club, was
fully up to their high standard of
playing, as indeed were all their

pieces and the encores to which
they were obliged to respond. One
of the most ludicrous us well as
novel features of the evening was
the G rand Ballet Parisien led by
the renowned premiere, Mademoi
selle Kaleokaliniohipuauma and
eight of her famous coryphees.
The farce "Trilby, the Co-ed,"
or " Svengali's Forward Pass"
was most realistically portrayed.
The take-offs on Berkeley were very
good indeed, and many a joke was
cracked at our rival's expense. J.
T. McGrew, '96, as Madame Vin
ard, house-keeper for the three ath
letes and "art students incident
ally,'' Geo. Baldwin, '9(5, as Sven
gali," manager of the Berkeley var
sity and member of U. C. faculty,"
and C. K. Field, '95, as Trilby,
were especially good, although all
took their parts with credit. The
song "Ben Bolt" by Trilby and
the song and dance by Taffy, the
Laird, and Little Hillee were much
enjoyed. Baldwin, as Svengali,
did the best bit of acting he has
ever done before a Stanford aud
ience. Dillon as Signorini Char
lotta Ignatio Dillonini, the skirt
dancer, won considerable credit by
his dexterous exhibition ; his dance
was one of the most popular feat
ures of the entertainment. The
Glee Club as " Schneider's Band,"
sung with "fake" instruments,
made a great hit and were obliged
by enthusiastic applause to repeat
the number. The last number on
the regular program was a ludi
crous balcony scene from " Romeo
et Juliette," by Mine. Cardinale
and Signor Bellow, and was inter
preted as only they can. This
number was followed by liv
ing pictures, which were well
presented, although on account of
the lateness of the hour few re
mained to see them all.
Three of the numbers, the
"Drinking Song," "Three Old
Fakes," and "Trilby, the Co-Ed,"
were written by C. K. Field, '95.
The entire affair was originated
and presented underthe supervision
of Chas. J>. Pinkam, manager,
Chas. Dillon, stage manager, and
11. I). Connick, musical director,
and to them a large share of the
credit is due for the success of the
entertainment.
