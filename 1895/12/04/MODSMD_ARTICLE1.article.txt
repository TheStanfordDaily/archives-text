# STUDENT BODY CONTROL.
## A 						Communication and an Interview on the Burning Question of the Day in Student Affairs. 
### 
The following communication
was received Tuesday of last week,
but could not be published until
today on account of lack of space:
Editor Daily Palo Alto: The
report of the committee appointed
to devise a scheme to bring the mu
sical organizations of the University
under the control of the treasurer
of the Associated Students makes
the further existence of the organ
izations a matter of question, and
if the students at large desire to see
the musical organizations continue
to exist they should take some im
mediate action regarding the re
port of the committee as published
in Friday evening's issue of the
Daily Palo Alto.
It may be well enough for the
treasurer of the Student Body to
receive a salary for taking pleasure
trips with the Glee Club ; but when
it comes to a careful consideration
of the ruling that any surplus
money must be held by the treas
urer of the Student Body, while any
deficit must be met by assessing
the members of the club, any fair
minded person can see that the
demand is unjust.
Art. 1, c, will cause no end of
trouble and delay. As each voucher
must be signed by the president of
the Associated Students and pre
sented by the business manager of
the club to the treasurer of the
Associated Students for payment,
the question arises, what would be
done in case the president of the
Associated Students happened to
be in Los Angeles ; would the club
have to remain in town until a
voucher for hotel bills, etc., could
be sent to the president for his sig
nature ?
Art. 11, l>, states that the respec
tive clubs shall not have anything
to say as to whether they may loan
one another money, but must be
governed by the approval or dis
approval of the president and treas
urer of the Associated Students.
Art. 111, b, again restricts the
clubs, and virtually takes from
them the power to arrange for any
trips. The manager of any club is
elected to fill the office of manager,
and is supposed to know as to
whether it will be of advantage for
his club to give a concert or series
of concerts without the advice of
the president and treasurer of the
Associated Students. The object of
such an arbitrary ruling 1 can not
understand, nor do I think that
anyone would undertake the man
a gen lent under such restrictions.
Art. IV is a fitting climax to the
report, stating that no organiza
tion or club shall go on any tour
or take part in any entertainment
under the management or auspices
of any person or organization
foreign to the University. This
article sounds the death knell of
the musical organizations of the
University. Are we in a prep,
school or a University?
Jt requires no great amount of
consideration and thought to see
that every concert given under a
guarantee or under the auspices of
the Y. M. C. A.,etc., of the different
towns is in direct violation of this
article. According to this ruling

the Glee Club could not go to Palo
Alto and give a concert for the
benefit of the Improvement Fund,
nor could it go to any other town
and sing for charity, percentage, or
a guarantee. There is not, nor
never will be, an organization go
out from this University that can
avoid violating this article; and
further, no trip can be made with
out guarantee or percentage con
tracts. Such being the case is it
reasonable to expect a Glee Club to
exist, spending time and money on
music, with no prospects of a trip
in view ?
On account of the continued an
noyance and trouble forced upon
the clubs by such rulings as the
above I feel justified in severing my
connection with the musical organi
zations of the University, to go into
effect Friday, Nov. 29, 1895.
Chas. B. Pinkham,
Manager Vaudeville, Orchestra,
and Glee Clubs.

H. D. Sheldon, chairman of the
Executive Committee, was seen by
a representative of the Daily Palo
Alto in regard to the questions
touched upon in the communica
tion. He stated that the objections
urged against the rules drawn up
by the Executive Committee were
the result of misconception, but the
committee, foreseeing the difficulty
which the ambiguity of one or two
expressions might give rise to, in
tended to revise the rules in such a
manner as to avoid the objections.
The signature of the president will
not be necessary to meet obligations
incurred on trips and the clubs may
appear in entertainments given by
outside parties providing that no
trip shall be taken under foreign
management. The Executive Com
mittee is willing to make any ra
tional changes which will in any
way facilitate the work of the
musical organizations.
In regard to the charges of un
due interference brought against
the committee he replied that every
endeavor has been made to reduce
interference to a minimum. The
clubs have the handling of their
own funds, which are kept apart
for them and can not be used for
other purposes. They elect their
own manager and other oflicersfree
from outside influence. The only
restraint put upon their independ
ence is the supervision of their ac
counts by the officers of the Student
Body. This is absolutely necessary
for the protection of the University
name and the prevention of profes
sionalism. There has been noth
ing to prevent the two or three
persons in control of the clubs from
making deals which tended to de
stroy the good name of the Univer
sity. This has occurred at the Uni
versity of California, and although
it has thus far been impossible to
collect evidence to prove anything
of the kind here, the danger is none
the less apparent.
Mr. Sheldon added in conclusion
that the committee had every rea
son to believe that the great major
ity of the members of the musical
organizations were heartily in favor
of the proposed changes which would
protect them from the manipulation
of unscrupulous managers. The
clamor raised in opposition to the
Executive Committee is evidently

the work of a few individuals, who,
angered at the defeat of their plans
of self-aggrandizement, take this
method of exhibiting their spite.
