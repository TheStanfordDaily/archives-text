In our thankfulness to the Var
sity football team for the valuable
services rendered, let us not lose
sight of the work done by the second
eleven. Without these men a well
trained Varsity team would have
been an impossibility. Some of
those on the second eleven turned
out faithfully day after day know
ing all the while that they had no
chance of making the Varsity, but
giving their time out of genuine
patriotism, it seems no more than
fair that these men should receive
some recognition of their loyaltyâ€”
at least a sweater might be given to
each of them.
