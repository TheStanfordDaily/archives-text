As the clipping from the Oakland
Saturday Xiglit was read on the
bulletin board yesterday, Stanford
students could not but reflect how lit
tle the slur at the Berkeley faculty,
whether deserved or not, would ap
ply to our teachers. We of Stan
ford are so accustomed to seeing
professors and students mingle to
gether and so totally unacquainted
with antagonism between faculty
and student body that perhaps we
often but poorly appreciate the un
usual freedom we are allowed in
the matter of meeting on a com
mon level with our superiors. We
are certainly treated with much
more consideration in this respect
than the students of most like in
stitutions in this country. It
should be the aim of every student
to prolong these pleasant relations
and to allow no abuse of the privi
lege to terminate them.
