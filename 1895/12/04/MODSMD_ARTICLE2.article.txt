						Stanford Gun Club.
## 
### 
A few students have been dili
gently at work during the past few
days attempting the organization
of a gun club at Stanford. Many
students and a few professors have
signified their intention of joining;
therefore the club is almost an as
sured success. The club is not to
be formed solely for the benefit of
those who can already shoot well,
but also for those who desire
to become proficient in the art of
shooting.
Grounds can be secured within
easy access to the University, where
a rifle range and traps for clay
pigeons can be erected at a trifling
expense. For the majority of
students individual trap shooting
is far too expensive to be indulged
in, but by uniting in a club the ex
pense will be inconsiderabla.
Although there are now a num
ber of organizations in college there
is ample room fora gun club.
Those who contemplate joining the
club can hand their names in to
Dan E. Williams, '98, or Horace
Pomeroy, '97, at Encina Hall.
