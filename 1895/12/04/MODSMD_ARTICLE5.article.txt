# Regulation of the Varsity Sweater at Oxford.
## 
### 
The following is an extract from
a letter to the Harvard Crimson
concerning the method adopted at
Oxford to control the use of the
various varsity sweaters:
A "committee of blues" regulates
the granting of the varsity uniform
in each particular instance. This
committee is composed of the lead
ing varsity captains — the presi
dents of the boat club and athletic
club and the captains of the cricket
club and of the Rugby and Asso
ciation football teams. They usu
ally award a "full blue" to the
members of the live teams they
represent; and in addition, to the
chief representative in court tennis
and rackets. On the athletic team,
however, the "second strings" get
only a "half blue." This differs
from a "full blue" in that the
sweater has no blue trimming 011
the neck and sleeves, and is with
out the emblem of the club on the
breast, while the blazer and the
cap are striped with white. Mem
bers of the cross-country team, the
bicycle team, the (field) hookey
team, and perhaps some others are
all awarded half blues, which differ
slightly in each case. Members of
such minor organizations as the
golf club, the shooting club, the
swimming club, etc., wear special
colors, not the university blue. The
etiquette with regard to all these
colors —and in fact all club colors
—is strict, and in consequence the
most famous "blue" is proud to
wear his insignia.
