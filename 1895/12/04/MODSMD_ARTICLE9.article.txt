As yet the element of social
events has been almost entirely ab
sent from Stanford life during the
first semester. To those who look
to an increased enjoyment of this
feature hereafter, the plan of hold
ing a Freshman Glee will appeal
as a highly desirable innovation.
The undertaking of the Class of '99
is worthy of all praise and success.
Every one should make an effort to
have this Glee so successful that
in the future the Freshman Glee
will be considered one of the fixed
and important events of the year.
