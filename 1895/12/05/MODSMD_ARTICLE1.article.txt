slated that he would have the re

ing committee in a few days. Rep
resentatives from the Glee and
Mandolin Clubs and the Orchestra
were present. Sutherland, '98, rep
resenting the (ilee and Mandolin
Clubs, submitted the following to
the Committee: As the Glee and
Mandolin Clubs have recognized
the authority of the Student Body,

clubs? If it will do so all receipts
now in the treasury of said clubs
will be turned over to the Execu

constitute reasonable expenses on
outside trips.
