There are many college duties
to be performed every year which
we are too prone to delay until the
final semester, and it seems as
though some changes should he
made. Nearly all the elections,
the debates, the hops, etc., have
heretofore taken place in the second
half, yet there appears to he no
good reason why a considerable
number of these matters should not
be disposed of during the lirst
semester of the college year. Elec
tion of football captain, preliminary
debates, and certain other routine
functions might profitably be dis
posed of during the lirst semester,
leaving the second, which is bound
to be sufficiently arduous under
any circumstances, somewhat freer
for University work.
