The Freshman Glee promises to
be a charming innovation. It
breaks the long monotony of the
first semester and affords an op
portunity for new students to make
friends before Commencement
week. Many young people upon
first coming to Stanford are dis
satisfied and homesick, not because
their studies are disappointing, but
because there is a terrible gap in
their lives which was once filled
by friends and relations. These re
gard college life as an <l inhospit
able shore" and feel an absolute
need for companionship and some
social life.
It is almost universally conceded
nowadays that we work better for
having played a reasonable amount.
It is commendable in the youngest
class to be the first to open the
doors of social life and to do ibis
early in the college year.
