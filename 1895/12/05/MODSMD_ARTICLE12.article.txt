Now that football is over, we
may establish fraternal relations
with our friends across the bay.
A great many of the Stanford stud
ents were entertained at Berkeley
on Junior day and experienced the
pleasure of friendly association with
other students and of finding that
even rivals have much in common.

The Stanford Mandolin Club and
the U. C. Glee Club demonstrated
last summer that harmony is pos
sible between even the cardinal and
blue and gold.
It can not but be harmful to
both universities to constantly bar
ter cheap wit and poor jokes at
each other's expense. While riv
alry does much to stimulate energy,
common sense and co-operation
do more, and we, as students,
should do our best to show that in
telligent people are not dependent
upon cliques, but are congenial the
world over.
