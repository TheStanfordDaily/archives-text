Chancellor Macckacken of the
U Diversity of theCity of New York has
started a movement to bring about
the classification of American uni
versities,colleges, and schools, which
will doubtless meet the approval of
all the higher institutions of learn
ing. His plan is to have Congress
direct the Commissioner of Educa
tion to inquire into the standing of
educational institutions and to
classify them according to their
real status. It is well known that
degrees are coming to be granted
with such lavish profusion on ac
count of the great increase of so
called universities that they are
losing much of their meaning, and
the graduate of the high-grade uni
versity has been compelled to add
to his degree the name of the
school granting it, in self-protection.
It is time to establish a standard
which means something, if we are
to have a standard at all, and Chan
cellor Maccracken will deserve great
praise if the present movement suc
ceeds.
