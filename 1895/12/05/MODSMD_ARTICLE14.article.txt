It is not the mission of the
Daily Palo Alto nor its policy to
act as an adviser to the Faculty.
Generally it is presumption fora
college paper to inform professors
what they should or should not do.
But when there is a wide-spread
feeling among the students of an
institution that injustice is being
done, it is right that this feeling
should find expression through the
college paper.
That is the present condition.
Complaints are heard on all sides
that members of the Faculty who
have not been able to accomplish
up to date what they had planned are
now piling on work beyond all
reason. A class is not to be blamed
if the work lias lagged. It is the
duty of the teacher to so prescribe
work that the proper portion of the
subject or text shall be mastered
day by day. If this .is not done it
is unjust to ask tlie class to carry
a double burden the last few weeks
of the semester. If a student has
neglected a thesis in some subject
till the last, he must suffer for that.
But he should not be compelled at
the same time to take double the
usual amount of work in a number
of different courses.
