We Americans in modern times
tend too strongly to physical de
generacy. We live too much in
doors, we allow our muscles to be
come flabby and flaccid, we eat too
much, and, sometimes, drink too
much, and then run to the doctor
to patch us up and repair the waste
for which we ourselves are directly
responsible. Which is the better
fora boy of twenty, to have a
broken arm or a blackened eye or
a sprained ankle, or fora man of
forty to surrender to chronic
pepsia, gout, rheumatism, nervous
debility, or any of the long train of
diseases which result from neglect
of the physical system, followed by
a necessary reaction upon the men
tal and nervous system?
If the football boys roll each
other in the mud and sand; if they
stack up a pyramid of waving arms
and legs until the man at the bot
tom is pumped out of wind; if a boy
roots his nose in the dirt and plows
a furrow with his forehead, what of
it? There is no real harm done,
and his power of almost immediate
recuperation is a complete demon
stration of his physical condition
and a justification of the training
he has gone through. Just so it is
with rowing, running, walking,
jumping, baseball playing, throw
ing the hammer, and all the num
berless varieties of athletic sports.
The use of athletics is to be com
mended —its abuse is to be con
demned. Some boys ought never to
be allowed to run fifty yards at top
speed; others can run a quarter or
half mile and come out as fresh as
a new-born rose.
What is needed is to put ath
letic sports on a strictly scientific
basis. No young man, whether he
be a college student or not, should
be permitted to go into training fin
ally sort of a great event until he
has been examined closely and
carefully to discover whether he
possess any sign of organic disease
or weakness. Passing muster in
this way and coming out with a
clean bill of health, let him row or
run or leap or play football or do
anything of the kind he likes, and
if, in his experience, he happens to
come to some temporary or trifling
hurt, he will be the first to charge
it to the fortunes of war, and his
grandchildren will get the benefit,
not of the injury but of the high
physical condition which enabled
him to treat it as a trifle and to re
cover from it immediately and
easily.— Chronicle..
