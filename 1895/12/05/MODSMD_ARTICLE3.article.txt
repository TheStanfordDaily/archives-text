# "MAN vs. MACHINERY."
## An Interesting Lecture to a Socialistic Audience. 
### 
Dr. Ross lectured last night on
"Man vs. Machinery" before the
Liberty Section of the Socialistic
Labor Party in the Turk-street
Socialistic Temple, San Francisco.
His lecture was the second of a
course on economics and social
problems arranged by this organi
zation. The first was given by Hon.
Thomas V. Cator. Last year Pro
fessors Moses and Plehn of the Uni
versity of California delivered lect
ures in a similar series.
The Call this morning gave the
following abstract of the lecture by
Dr. Ross:
The tool is more under the com
mand of the man wielding it than
is the machine under the man at
tending it. Machinery is less under
the control of the will than is the
tool.
Machinery has come gradually
into use, yet the nineteenth cen
tury is the age of the power of
machinery. There are those who
believe that this is the burst
of inventive genius that will never
be equalled. Others there be who
think the twentieth century will
surpass it.
How shall we regard this era of
mechanism ? One view is that a
certain character of labor can be
performed by machinery that can
not be done by any other means.
Another is that machinery excuses
the employment of human strength.
Surely it is a good thing that the
waters flowing down the Sierras
may enable us to ride about the
city. We may say very truly, when
a machine has been invented that
does the work of a hundred men
we have practically a hundred
slaves. It is a slavery that en
slaves no one, however.
There is a difference in the view
of the introduction of a machine
on the part of the man who owns
it and the man whom it displaces.
A set of optimists tell us that,
while machinery may deprive a
man of his job, it benefits him in
the direction of a lessening in the
price of commodities. This is small
comfort to the man who loses a
dollar a day, if he is able to get his
socks three cents cheaper a pair.
Neither do the optimists give ma
terial help by their theory that
there will be a greater demand for
goods which the introduction of
machinery has made cheaper. That
is questionable reasoning. 1 ap
prehend that if there should be a
great reduction in coffins there
would be no inclination on our
part to lay in a stock of coffins.
England's industrial history
shows that the introduction of ma
chinery tends to drive men over to
other forms of service—in other
words, a shifting of labor from
trades employing machines to those
not yet applying them. Men are
leaving industries that are steady
and sure, for others more unsteady
and precarious—from the manu
facture of staple articles to those
for which the demand is less cer
tain.
The use of machinery has tended
either to prolong the day's labor or
to interfere with its being short
ened.
Machinery tends to restrict the

liberty of the man who attends it.
It has a tendency, by the monotony
of its service, to shrivel up the
higher powers.
Machinery does not deprive a
lawyer, a physician, a newspaper
man of his income. It does not
disturb it except that its purchas
ing power is increased thereby. It
is the laborer whom it drives from
the position of a skilled to an un
skilled laborer.
A man who does the same char
acter of work as a mule is in dan
der of losing his job through that
mule. Likewise, the man who does
such work as may be done by dyn
amite may be superseded by dyn
amite.
People's incomes are becoming
more unequal. There is a disper
sive power of machinery. The
whole system of competition tends
to this end. This is no one's fault.
No man is to blame for the market
value of classes of work. It is a
natural, spontaneous evolution.
Every time a machine has been
introduced it has been in obedi
ence to some claim or law of ad
vantage.
Sooner or later society will en
deavor to mitigate the evils caused
by the general use of machinery.
There is no use trying to abolish
machinery. It represents mechani
cal civilization, and the people will
object to return to mechanical bar
barism. 1 believe socialism or
collectivism can cure the evil, but
that, and that alone, would seem to
me like pouring the baby out with
the bath. Society will, I believe,
provide for the manual training of
youth to the point of skill.
