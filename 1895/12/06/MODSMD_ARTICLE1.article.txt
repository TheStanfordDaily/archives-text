# IN SEARCH OF SPECIMENS.
## A
						Party from the Hopkins Zoological Laboratory Going to South America. 
### 
The Panama fish expedition to
We sent out under the patronage of
Mr. Timothy Hopkins will leave
Han Francisco next Wednesday on
the San Juan, the boat which
picked up the Colima survivors.
The party will consist of Dr. Gil
bert, C. J. Pierson, '96, R. C. Mc-
Gregor. '97, and Starks, sp.
Panama, the object point, is in
the United States of Colombia and
has a very mixed population. The
place is eight degrees this side of
the equator and it will be impos
sible to stir out of doors even at
this time of the year without carry
ing umbrellas as a protection
against the sun's rays. This is the
most healthful part of the jrear at
Panama. It is now the dry season
there, which will continue three or
four months.
On the way down the ship will
stop at eight ports, some stops be
ing fora day or two. At these ports
the party will take boats and go off
to spend the time killing tish with
dynamite and collecting them.
Finally Panama will be reached
after twenty-five days and the
most important part of the work
will begin. A month will be the
length of the stay; then Aspin
wall will probably be visited and
some collecting done there.
Upon arriving at Panama, a
house will be secured in which the
work will be carried on. Particu
lar attention will be given to the
collecting of tish, and of inverte
brates, reptiles, and mammals.
McGregor goes along to collect
birds, and the party will pick up
everything in the way of zoological
specimens. Quite a collection will
be made of the skeletons of fish,
and one or two will work at this
all the time.
There are three or four methods
of procuring tish on an expedition
of this kind. In the tirst place,
many are found in the markets
and bought from local fishermen.
One method is to put poison in tide
pools and to dip out the dead fish.
Another is to put dynamite in the
water to stun or kill its finny in
habitants; when this is done the
party usually is followed by fish
eating birds, and it is often a race
between the scientists and their
hungry rivals to see who gets the
specimens. Still another way is to
seine for the tish ; and this means
is used very extensively.
The poison used in the tide pools
is something resembling strychnine.
It is made in Mexico and a supply
will be taken on board at Mazat
lan. This poison turns the water
milky and seems to affect the eye
sight of the watery tribes. It
brings fishes in great numbers out
of rocks and clefts which otherwise
could not have been secured.
The trip will be something like
the one made by Dr. Jordan and
eight students to Mexico last win
ter. Dr. Gilbert has been in these
waters twice before and has de
scribed a great many new tish found
there. One large collection he
once made there was burned in the
museum of the University of In
diana and at the same time manu
scripts describing them were de

stroyed. It is hoped to secure
several specimens already known
of in this way by Dr. Gilbert, as
well as many new ones.
A set of all specimens obtained
will be kept at the University.
Then some will be sent to the Brit
ish Museum, to the German Mu
seum at Vienna, and to the differ
ent museums of the United States,
among them the Smithsonian In
stitute and the California Academy
of Sciences.
There will be a steamer down
every two weeks carrying mail, lint
as it will take a month to cover
the distance, the party will not be
at all over-run with news from
home. They go prepared to take a
good many pictures and doubtless
they will find plenty to interest
them. They expect to be back the
first of March.
It is not certain that the party
will be able to start Wednesday.
The San Juan has not arrived from
the south. She was scheduled at
first to sail tomorrow night on
the return trip from San Fran
cisco; two changes of time have
since been made and still another
postponement may be necessary.
