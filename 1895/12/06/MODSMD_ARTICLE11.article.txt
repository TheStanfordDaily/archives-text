Eveby student who cares enough
for the future of Stanford musical
organizations to lmve followed with
interest the development of the pro
visions securing student body con
trol of them must now have a feel
ing of relief that the controversy
has terminated amicably. The
plan finally adopted by the Execu
tive Committee, by which the stud
ent body assumes explicit control
of the different musical and dra
matic clubs, and in turn becomes
responsible for any deficit that may
occur, meets with general approval.
Nearly every one has believed that
some change from the irresponsible
management of the past was desir
able. But many questioned the
justice of control that was only
partial and that seemed to place
the clubs at a financial disadvan
tage.
However desirable the new con
dition of things may be ideally,
there will doubtless be many dif
ficulties found in the administra
tion of this general control. The
treasurer's duties will be immensely
increased, and doubtless many dis

putes will arise between him and
the club managers, and at times
some will feel that the new system
bus failed. In spite of these con
tingencies, the general feeling is
that the musical organizations have
entered upon a new and more pros
perous era in their history; an era
that will redound more to the good
name of Stanford than could the
old regime.
