# The 						Southern Trip.
## 
### 
Since the Executive Committee
of the Student Body assumed en
tire control of the (llee and Man
dolin Clubs, preparations for the
southern trip during the Christmas
holidays have been actively carried
forward. The members of the t * lee
Club who will go on this trip were
selected yesterday and are as fol
lows: First tenor, Sutherland, '98,
Magee, gr., Sewall, '98; second tenor,
Bush, '98, McNeil, '98, Decker, '98,
Schneider, '98; first bass, Abbott,
'98, Young, '97, Dillon, '99, Pink
ham, '96; second bass, Cochran,'96,
King, '99, Kaufman, '97, Schlacks,
'99. The members of the Mando
lin Club will be chosen the first of
next week. Both clubs will have
to do a, great amount of work in
order to become well prepared for
the trip,which will in all probability
commence two weeks from today.
E. R. Zion, gr., has been selected as
advance agent and will leave Mon
day for the south to arrange most
of the contracts and to do the ad
vertising and billing in the towns
where concerts will take place. A
concert will be given in San Fran
cisco before the clubs start and it
has also about been dteidcd to give
one in the University chapel on
next Thursday evening.
Although these matters are being
pushed with the greatest dispatch,
yet there are several questions
which have recently arisen, espec
ially in regard to finances, between
the student body and the clubs,
which must be amicably settled
before the trip is assured.
