### 
A new volume of the Students'
I Series of Latin Classics, published
by Leach, Shewell ifc Sanborn,
| has been received. This number,
I the latest one issued, is the Formio
of Terence, by Herbert Charles El
! mer, Ph. 1)., Assistant Professor of
| Latin in Cornell University, and
| belongs to the series of which Prof.
; F. M. Pease and Prof. H. T. Peck
| of Columbia College are the editors.
The work has been prepared with
great care and contains besides the
text a history of the play, a his
tory of the Greek and Roman
j drama, extensive notes and biblio
j graphy ; stage directions for the
i play add to the value of the book.
It will find ready acceptance for
use in advanced Latin work, es
pecially as it is the only English
edition of this play.
This series was begun several
years ago by Professors Pease and
j Peck and has already attracted
considerable attention, mainly on
account of the excellent manner in
which the volumes issued have
been prepared. Pr.of. Pease in se
lecting his corps of assistants chose
for the most part young men, and
it is worthy of note that several
have been advanced in their posi
tions since beginning the work. A
large number of professors are at
present working on books for this
series, some of them not yet ready
to have their names announced ;
but among those whose books have
appeared are Paul Shorey, Ph. 1).,
Chicago University; J. H. Kirk
land, l'h. J)., Vanderbilt Univer
sity; Isaac Flagg, Ph. 1)., Univer
sity of California; William L.
Cowles, A. M., Amherst; Charles
S. Smith, A. M., Princeton ; Walter
Miller, A. M., Stanford; Harriet
Waters Preston and Louise Dodge,
Stanford.
The book on Latin Composition
prepared by Prof. Miller has had
an extensive sale. It is now being
used in the following, among other,
institutions: Vale, Princeton, Uni
versity of California, Chicago Uni
versity, Amherst, Dartmouth, Bow
doin, University of Vermont, Wel
lesley, Union College, Ohio State
University, Oberlin, University of
Michigan, Rutgers College, Univer
sity of Missouri, University of Kan
sas, Rochester University, Cornell
I University, Columbia College, La
: fayette College, Northwestern Uni
versity, De I'auw University, and
in the University of North Carolina.
Another of this series, " The Pri
: vate Life of the Romans," is by
Harriet Waters Preston and Louise
Dodge, both of Stanford. It is a
book which should be in the hands
of every classical student in the
country; students in Roman His
tory will also find it invaluable.
The Nation in an extended review
on February 15, 1894, says:"The
editors may be congratulated on a
work well done. Their book, in
i spite of its condensed treatment, is
no mere marshalling of facts; it is
readable, interesting, and in the
main reliable. It deserves a place in
the library of every good classical
scholar, and standing alone as it
does in the field, it will probably
enjoy a large sale."

Most of the volumes of the series
which have appeared are on ad
vanced work, while a great number
of those now in preparation are for
preparatory work.
