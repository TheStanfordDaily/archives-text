# The 						Sunday Sermon.
## 
### 
Dr. Thoburn preached in the
chapel Sunday morning on the sub
ject "Rest." The music was of
unusual interest, the Orchestra con
tributing to it. Dr. Thoburn began
by quoting the following hymn:
(), where shall rest be found,
Rest for the weary soul?
Twere vain the ocean's depths to
sound,
Or pierce to either pole.
The world can never give
The bliss for which we sigh.
It is not the whole of life to live,
Nor all of death to die.
lieyond this vale of tears
There is a life above,
Unmeasured by the flight of
years;
And all that life is love.
We are struck with the peculiar
unfitness of the view contemplated
by this hymn, written nearly a
century ago, to that which we of
today hold. The spiritual lives of
those who sung this hymn would
indicate that they lived entirely for
heaven; that man's business in this
world was to hold on to himself, as
it were, until he got through the
vale of tears, when at last he should
be where he is fitted to be.
1 speak of this subject because
the present generation is an heir to
the previous ones, in which the
people did things that still con
tinue to come up before us and
cause us to stumble. And with
this hymn before me, I inquire,
what is rest? Is life a long night
mare of which it is a crime to rid
ourselves, and a. blessing to be rid
of? 1 love life —there is so much
more of sweet than bitter in it. I
have an affection for my body, not
withstanding it has sometimes
given me trouble. And this dear
old world has had many more
angels than devils in it. Why,
then, this melancholy wail? Is it
true that faith and hope do not
abide?
The answer is partly found in the
fact that men love gloom and mel
ancholy. The weeds of mourning
are not worn simply because it is
inevitable. If you attempt to lift
the trouble from some lives they
will hold on to them; they really
enjoy being miserable; to them the
darker side of life has an unmis
takeable attraction. This has been
due largely to the mistakes of past
generations. For example, all
through the Catholic countries we
find very great emphasis laid on
the pains, the blood and gaping
wounds of Christ; the pains of this
life, of purgatory, etc. And today
many people religiously attend all
funerals, not to honor the dead or
console the living, but to avail
themselves of the opportunity to
grieve.
Then, again, men love the mys
terious. We laugh at the thous
ands who are at present worship
ping the wonder-worker at Denver,
yet we will buy at the drug store
patent medicines that are repre
sented as working greater miracles
by far than Schlatter ever thought
of. For the last two thousand
years antichrist has always been
decked in the uniform of Christians.
Furthermore, men like ease and
rest. Throughout human history
man has been lighting for ease.

Although not entitled to any spec
ial credit, yet in so doing lie has
realized power and made steady
progress; by enlarging his quarters
lie found increased responsibilities,
and by his struggle to escape them
he found still greater burdens.
Progress has been not voluntary,
but compulsory. Christ has be
come a part of man's environment,
and man cannot rest until he has
measured up to the standard which
he sees in Christ. Rest, then, in
this life is impossible.
Hut I affirm in contradiction to
this hymn that rest —real, recuper
ating, invigorating rest —can be
found in this world, in this body,
during this life. This world with
holds its blessing only from those
who sigh; it is a vale of tears for
those only who will not look for the
rainbow tints reflected from the
falling drops. This life, more than
any other life that man knows any
thing about, is a life of love. The
old life which we inherit and still
feel was especially vicious in that
it directed man away from his only!
possible source of happiness and
peace —1 mean his inner life. That
old life was governed by external
standards and regulated by stern
commands, so that the one who lived
it walked through life a slave. It
destroyed man's faith in himself—
a natural result of governing man
by laws.
Jesus Christ had faith in man
and believed that man could stand
alone and be a law unto himself.
Hut this old standard set men to
watching, studying, knowing them
selves; and even today men go to
prayer meetings and, instead of
praying, feverently emu late their
virtue. On the other hand we
sometimes laugh at persons who
have trouble in their religious life;
but a close examination will dis
cover the elements of the same
trouble in our own lives. This self
study and horror destroys indi
viduality and thwarts human pro
gress. Hook at the young child
(before it is contaminated by con
tact with older people): every mo
ment is the best moment of its life.
We talk of altruism as loving
other people, just because they are
other people. This is not the rea
son why the child loves its mother;
it knows no difference between its
love for its mother and love for it
self. So there should be no dis
tinction of love in altruism.
The greatest sin is not ignorance, I
but laziness. The peace of God is j
the peace of living and growing,!
not of planningand taking thought;
because we stop growing when we
begin to plan. Do you remember
those momentous words of Christ,!
''The kingdom of God is within
you"? And yet through all these I
years men have been trying to find j
that kingdom somewhere else.
How can 1 have a kingdom within
me? by drawingall beautiful things!
within, and then beholding them
there? No; the moment 1 begin to
accumulate, I begin to lose.
The little stream runs down the
mountain side refreshing as it goes |
the lives of flowers, trees, cattle,
anil men. It did not know at the i
start what it was about to do. It
simply took the little life that was
given it, and diligently went its
way.
