In accordance with the constitu
tion by which it is governed, the
publication of the Daily Palo Alto
will stop for this semester with Fri
day's issue. It may be said in ex
planation to new students that this
is following both law and custom.
The Daily Palo Alto has never
been published during the last week
of a semester. The object is that
the editors and assistants, the print
ers and the devil, may take advan
tage of the brief respite to square
themselves if possible with their
professors and get credit for the
semester's work.
Anyone having announcements
to make should send them in as
early this week as possible, cer
tainly in time for Friday's issue.
