The action of the Executive Com
mittee in appropriating a sum for
the purchase of sweaters for the
members of the second eleven was
an eminently proper one. So anx
ious was the management to keep
down expenses this year that the
members of the second team were
given no short trips as they were
last season. By this action the
second eleven is given well deserved
recognition. .
Of course the sweaters will not be
\ arsity sweaters, but they should
have some distinctive mark and
their use should be as carefully
watched as the use of Varsity
sweaters. No person who was not
a member of the second eleven
should ever be allowed to wear these
sweaters. When there is a pro
miscuous use of Varsity insignia by
those not entitled to that privilege,
the honor of wearing them is infin
itely lessened.
