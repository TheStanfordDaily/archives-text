A committee of fifteen has been
appointed l>y the president of the
Associated Students to devise some
plan hy which cheating in exami
nations may be prevented. Its
plan will be reported to a student
body meeting and there acted upon
as student sentiment shall dictate.
The aim was to make the commit
tee as representative as possible, so
that its action may be both well
considered and acceptable to the
student body.
This movement is nothing if not
timely. Cheating in examinations
corrupts (lie morals and destroys
the good name of an institution of

learning. There is no excuse for
its existence ; the very fact that its
prevalence in the past is offered as
a reason why leniency should he
shown in present cases, is greater
cause for shame. But there are
many reasons why the action to
suppress the reprehensible practice
should come from the student body
and not from the faculty.
Such an attempt, if it is to he
effective, must arise from and he
supported by an aroused public
conscience. Faculty surveillance
can not be a substitute for student
honor. Every one in college must
be made to feel that dishonesty in
examinations disgraces him in the
eyes of his associates, if not in his
own opinion; and it must not only
disgrace him, but it must bring
upon him something more tangible
in the way of punishment.
That control of the matter should
be left to student sentiment is es
pecially desirable, because in that
way only can the unique relation
existing here between faculty and
students be preserved. Whenever
a member of the faculty shows a
lack of confidence in the honor of a
class, he falls at once in the esteem
of that class. Whenever a faculty
committee is forced in the perform
ance of its duty to mete out harsh
punishment to individuals, its posi
tion is unpleasant and at the same
time arouses antagonism. Every
case of the kind lessens the old de
gree of friendliness and mutual
confidence of faculty and students,
the most precious of our young tra
ditions.
The committee can do one of sev
eral things. It has the experience
of Amherst, of Princeton, of Cornell,
in their several attempts to solve
the same problem. One of these
plans may he favorably reported,
or a new and better one devised, if
possible. By ull means, let some
way of eradicating this disgrace lie
adopted ; and as one means to this
end, it should be recommended to
the members of the faculty that
they take care to so arrange exami
nations as not to offer premiums
upon dishonesty.
