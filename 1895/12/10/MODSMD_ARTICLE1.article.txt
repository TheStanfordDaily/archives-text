The semi-annual tournament for
the championship took place on
lioble courts Saturday lust. The
entries were as follows: Preliminar
ies—Byes: Misses Rose, Lieb, Mc-
Cray. First match, Misses Simons
and Phillips. The champion, Miss
Martin, entered for the finals.
The matches were as follows:
Miss Simons defeated Miss Phillips,
ti-2, (s—l. Miss Simons defeated
Miss Rose, 7-9, by default. Miss
McCray defeated Miss Lieb, 6-8,
6-8. The sub-linals between Misses
McCray and Simons resulted in
Miss McCray's winning, 6-2, 6-1.
r rhe finals between Miss Martin
and Miss McCray ended in a vic
tory for Miss Anna Martin, last
year's champion. On Saturday
a part of the championship match
came off. The game was very
closely contested and some excel
lent playing resulted. Miss Mc-
Cray won the first, set by a score of
6-8. She had an apparantly safe
lead in the second set, but the
champion finally won; score 8-6.
It was decided to settle the match
by making it the best three of five
sets, those of Saturday being
counted. Miss Martin won both
sets played, 6-1, 6-8, though every
point was a hot one. So for
another year the championship
will he held by the champion in
'94.
A trophy will soon be purchased
to be kept by the champion be
tween tournaments. By thismeans
it is hoped that a greater number
of entries will be made in the com
ing tournaments.
