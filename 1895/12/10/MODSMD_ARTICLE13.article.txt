The Orchestra, certain members
of the Glee Club and other vocal
ists of the University, and the
young ladies who decorate the
chapel altar, are all deserving of
praise for what the}' are doing to
lend attractiveness to the Sunday
morning services. Through their
efforts the service in question is
losing much of its resemblance to a
lecture, and becoming more devo
tional in its tone.
