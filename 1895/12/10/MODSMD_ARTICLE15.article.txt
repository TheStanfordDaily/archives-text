Thetie are a number of lessons
which we might learn with profit
from Berkeley, and not the least of
them is in regard to the election of
varsity football captain. Every
student recognizes the danger in
college politics of a too long ex
tended electioneering campaign.
Its evil effects are always notice
able, and while it is a good plan to
make the rivalry intense for all
honorable positions, it is a bad pol
icy to unduly prolong it. For this
reason it is desired that the foot
ball men should elect their next
vear's chieftan before the close of
the semester. By this method that
necessary ceremony is not left to
the long semester, which is sure to
be overcrowded with work under
any circumstances. Then, too, it
is good policy to hold the election

while the merits of all the players
are so fresh in the minds of the
students and before the football
enthusiasm has sunk into tempor
ary oblivion.
With the captain selected now,
he may be maturing his plans for
the coming season; and our chances
of success are heightened accord
ingly. By all means let the cap
tain of Stanford's team of '96 be
elected at once.
