Those who are interested in
baseball are wondering if the spirit
of economy, commendable in the
main, which lias overtaken the
student body, is going to interfere
with the plans for the improve
ment and repair of the baseball
field. The diamond as it now is
is in a wretched condition, and
some repairs are absolutely neces
sary before it will be in shape for
practice. Among those who are in
charge of the finances there seems
to be an undercurrent of feeling
that the expenses of baseball
should be cut down as much as
possible this year 011 account of the
fact that the expenditures from
this branch of athletics are an
nually greater than the receipts.
That baseball is, financially, a los
ing venture is admitted. That it is
right to reduce the expenses of
this sport is also admitted; but
the point upon which speculation
is rife, is whether in their zeal to
reduce the outlay, those in power
will not be so sweeping in their re
forms as to cripple the interests of
the game. If baseball is unavoid
ably a financial burden upon the
student body there of course is no
help for it, and as long as it con
tinues to be an important branch
of intercollegiate athletics, in order
to keep up our end of the game, it
is plainly evident expenses must
he met with a liberal, although not
an extravagant hand.
