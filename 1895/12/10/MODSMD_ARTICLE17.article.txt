## 
### 
Professor Munro, the chairman
of the Brown University Athletic
Committee, has compiled a report
on the general scholarship of the
athletics at that university. I lis
report shows the average standing
of the athletes to be unusually
high. The average standing of
twenty-one members of the football
team was 77.07 per cent. The fif
teen men on the baseball team who
competed in any game had aver
ages of 70.10 per cent. One senior
stood fifth in his class ; another
was awarded two degrees for extra
work. Professor Munro's report
shows that neither football nor
baseball are injurious to the
scholarships of earnest students.—
