verse by Edward M. Huhne, 'U7.
Among the new poems in the book
that have not been published as yet
is tin ode to Autumn, written in an
original verse form, and of which
we quote the opening stanzas:
() Autumn, child of the fast wan
ing year,
Of passionate desire and sad re
gret,
Whose tawny-coated thrushes,
hushed in fear,
No longer in leafless twilight
sing,
Whose linnets all their morning
lays forgot,
And wait in silence for the far
off spring,
How like thee is my heart in sor
row set!
The twittering swallow's nest be
neath the eaves
Lies empty and forsaken, and
afar
The idling lingers of the wind, the
leaves
Have strewn along the road
side as of old
Thy footsteps on the painted hill
sides are,
Hut all thy wondrous charm,
though wrought of gold,
Has left my heart as cold as some
pale star.
Among the literary people who
have given praise to Mr. Hulme's
work are Lizzette Wood worth Reese,
Louise Imogen CJuiney, and (Jra
hanie 11. Thomson.
