The action taken by the Execu
tive Committee of the student body
in regard to the Christmas holiday
trip of the Glee and Mandolin
Clubs, was so hasty and unsatis
factory that the (ilee Club deem it
advisable to present the facts to the
entire student body and t<> protest
against the action of the Executive j
Committee.
At the last regular meeting of I
this committee, representatives of!
the two clubs were present and sub-1
mitted a proposition whereby they
agreed to place themselves under!
the student body power, if the stu
dent body would assume all control
of the clubs. In accordance with
this proposition the clubs agreed to
turn over all money in the treas
uries, the amount being estimated
at about $150. To this proposi
tion the Executive Committee
agreed. Subsequent developments
showed outstanding liabilities of
both clubs amounting in the ag
gregate to over $100.
Preparations fora trip were well
under way before these arrange
ments were made. A day or so
later the Executive Committee de
manded that all debts be paid and
an advancement of $100 be made to
them before our representative
leave the campus. To raise this
amount an assessment was neces
sary from both clubs. The Glee
Club unanimously decided to raise
their share of the amount, and this
threw the decision as to a trip into
the hands of the Mandolin Club in
determining whether they would
raise their share.
Yesterday morning the president
of the Glee Club was informed by a
cursory remark that there would be
a meeting of the Executive Com
mittee, but nothing was said as to
the importance of the meeting; ac
cordingly only the business mana
ger of the Glee Club was present.
At this meeting the representa
tives of the Mandolin Club ap
peared and reported that their cluli
had refused to assess themselves.
The Executive Committee refused
to rescind its action. The Mando
lin Club then brought forward a pro
position to allow them to join with
the Berkeley Glee Club in a South
ern trip, the student body to as
sume all liabilities. To this the
Executive Committee agreed with
out demanding any advance.
There has been since the begin
ning of the' semester a desire on
the part of a few members of the
Mandolin Club to combine with
the Berkeley club in preference to
the Stanford club, although there
exists a written agreement which
combines the two Stanford clubs
until after the Christmas holidays.
To further this project with Berk
eley the president of the student
body was asked to call a meeting
of the Executive Committee with
out the knowledge of the Glee Club,
at which time they wished to se
cure the sanction of the committee
to this scheme "for promoting har
mony between the two universities''
and discord among our own Uni
j versity organizations. These are
the facts.
The necessary result of such an
action will be that the Glee Club,
1 an institution which has been one

of the University representatives
during the past four years, will be
sacrificed simply because the Ex
ecutive Committee chooses to be
lieve that a IJerkeley-Stanford com
bination will be more lucrative;
which is simply selling the Stan
ford Cilee Club for the fifty dollars
which the Mandolin Club has re
fused to advance.
The Executive Committee in de
fense of their action say that im
mediate action was necessary.
Very true, but by so acting they
took the chances of deciding
wrongly rather than delaying until
both sides could be heard.
We consider that they decided
wrongly. Respectfully yours,
EXECUTIVE CoMMITTEE
of the Glee Club.
