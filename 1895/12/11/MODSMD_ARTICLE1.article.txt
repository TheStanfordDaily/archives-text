# LAST NIGHT'S ENTERTAINMENT
## An Interesting Talk, Some Excellent Singing, and a Well-pleased Audience. 
### 
In place of the regular lecture
last evening, Mr. A. B. I'asmore of
San Francisco gave a short talk on
''Singing" with illustrations by
several of his pupils. The lecture
was devoted mainly to a discussion
of a proper use of the voice, with an
analysis of the qualities which go to
make up a good tone. The singing
was especially good and was re
ceived with well-deserved applause.
Miss Florence Wyman's solo was
marked by ease and finish; her
voice is a pure, high soprano with
a range of nearly two octaves; the
high notes were given with good
tone and without straining. Miss
Wyman's work in the part songs
was also noticeable for its excellence.
Miss Elna Olsson sang Florian's
song in a very agreeable manner;
her voice possesses in a high degree
the qualities of sweetness and sym
pathy.
The rendering of Schubert's
"Am Meere" by Miss Edith Waters
was particularly enjoyed. Miss
Waters' voice is an alto of very
unusual depth and richness of tone
and is suited for heavy solo work
as well as for part songs, where it
also appeared to great advantage.
Mr. W. E. Smith sang "Because
1 love you, Dear," Hawley. His
voice is both strong and high, but
his singing lacked flexibility and
expression.
The part songs were especially
attractive. The rendering of the
different parts was marked byclear
ness and individuality, although
the most harmonious inter-relation
was preserved. The work through
out was characterized by ease, nat
uralness, and freedom from strain
ing or labored effect, and the lack
of affectation or self-consciousness
on the part of the singers was evi
dence of artistic appreciation.
Mr. I'asmore said in part:
Realizing that lectures are fre
quent hereand professional,and that
musicians are infrequent and not
professional, 1 have brought with
me a number of young people who
will illustrate the lecture. The
lirst point I wish to make is in re
gard to differences of pitch. The
quality and kind of sounds of deli
nite pitch are almost as infinite
as those of indefinite pitch. We
have, for instance, in the orchestra
all kinds of instruments and strings,
and yet the ear will catch in an in
stant the difference between these
sounds. It is safe to say that the
same player will never produce the
same tone-quality twice on the vio
lin; the variation is the beauty of
the instrument. This wonderful
variation in the tone-quality is
shown more by the voice than in
any instrument; it takes an expert
alwavs to produce a good tone with
the voice and he can never produce
the same tone. An amateur will
occasionally produce a good tone,
the professional will always pro
duce a good tone, provided his
organs arc in line condition.
The power of raising or lowering
the pitch is I>y stretching or relax
ing the vocal cords. Above the
true vocal chords we have the false
vocal chords which have a very
great influence on the voice.

The breath bears the same re
lation to sinking that the bow does
in playing the violin. It bothers
the child a great deal to teach him
to get the bow in the right position:
it will give the teacher a great deal
of trouble to get him to hold it
right. And so it is of the greatest
importance to get the breath in
the right way.
Any one may learn to sing. In
order to become a tine singer you
have to have talent, dramatic
power, a good physical condition,
an opportunity, which often means
money, good vocal organs, and a
good teacher. Singers are born and
not made, but any ordinary voice
may be made into a tine voice.
