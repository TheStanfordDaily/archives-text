A recent editorial in the Daily
Palo Alto closed with this sen
tence : " It should be recommended
to the members of the faculty that
they take care to so arrange exam
inations as not to offer premiums
upon dishonesty."
Some have understood this to be
a complaint against over-work.
It was not meant to convey any
such idea, and how such a mean
ing could be put into the words is
difficult to see. The sentence im
plies that in the past some mem
bers of the faculty have given ex
aminations in which the opportun- 1
ity and temptation to cheat were
present in an uncalled-for degree.!
That this is true, any one con- j
versant with the facts must admit
Probably the most obvious illus-l
trations of this have been in classes,
composed of a number of sections,
reciting at different hours. To,
give these different sections the:
same sets of questions is to invite
cheating. Sometimes this has j
been done with classes in three!
sections reciting at three different I
hours. In such a case, is it a very i
black crime fora member of the
last section to ask one of the first j
what passages were given them to j
translate? Surely the ingenuity
of a professor should serve him to
prepare different sets of questions
for the different divisions.
