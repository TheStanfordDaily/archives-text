The difference in the character
of examinations also has much to
do with the question of cheating.
Some members of the faculty can
so choose their questions that the
student who has not done the work
can have little chance to pass by
unfair means ; others ask for iso
lated facts which can be so easily
cribbed that the temptation is of
ten too strong to be resisted. There
are subjects of course in which this
cannot be avoided, but attention
should be given to this phase of
the question.
But after all, any little short
comings on the part of professors
are of minor importance, paling
into insignificance by the side of
the question of what action we are
to take. A meeting of the As
sociated Students will be held to
morrow afternoon. If the com
mittee of fifteen has done its work
well some definite plan will then
be submitted. Whether the com
mittee's plan or some other shall
be adopted or the time wasted in
formulating resolutions that in a
month will be meaningless, depends
upon the attitude of the student
body. If the student body does
not rise to the occasion, a return to
the former indifference to cheating
will be inevitable. Now is the
time to act and to act to some pur
pose.
