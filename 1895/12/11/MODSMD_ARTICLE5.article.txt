Editor Daily Palo Alto:
To justify the Mandolin Club in
their action regarding the combina
tion with the U. C. Glee Club, I
desire to present a few facts and
explanations, as the situation of
the local Glee Club and the' Ma
ndolin Club is not at all generally
understood.
At the beginning of the semester
an invitation was extended to the
U. C. Glee Club fora trip South
this Christmas with the Mandolin
Club. It was accepted by theU.C.
Glee Club and acted upon. 11
seemed at the time that there was
no question but that the trip would
l»e made with Berkeley, and both
clubs planned accordingly. The
Stanford Glee Club began to com
plain, and the Mandolin Club in
deference to it put oft'arrangements
with Berkeley. The Glee Club was
then in an almost hopeless condi
tion. All the first tenors were gone
and there was no new material in
the Freshman Class, in fact there
were only five old members back,
including the captain of therfoot
ball team. The Mandolin Club,
however, was certainly generous in
postponing action waiting for the)
possible development of a glee club
which could accompany it on a
trip, and was jeopardizing its own
interests all the while, as it was
generally admitted that it was
doubtful if the Glee Club could ever
get in condition to go off the cam
pus. And at the least encourage
ment it agreed to take a trip South
with it this vacation, and began to
raise money for that purpose by
joining in the vaudeville entertain
ment.
It was expected that this would
raise money to enable the clubs to
start on the trip. Since making
the agreement with the Glee Club,
however, the situations of the clubs
have been entirely changed. Jt re
sulted that the student body took
charge of the clubs and guaranteed
their expenses.
They did so upon the representa
tion of those in charge of the
Vaudeville Club, and who were in
a position to know the finances of
the Thanksgiving entertainment,
that after debts were paid there
would he about $150 in the two
treasuries —for it was a question
whether the trip could be success
fully taken financially.
Owing to complications with the
management in the settlement of
the vaudeville entertainment, the
clubs have not received any money
as yet. The Executive Committee
of course required that the repre
sentations to them be at any rate
partly fulfilled, and required that
$100 advance be made before the
clubs could go away.
The final report of the manager
and treasurer of the Vaudeville
Club showed, however, that there
would be only about $ 10 for each
club, arid the Mandolin Club debts
amount to $90 above the amount
in the treasury. It refused to raise
the required $50 and so notified
the Executive Committee, which
refused to allow the trip to be taken.
Now in addition to this, accord
ing to the acknowledgement of its
leading members, the Glee Club is
not in condition to give satisfactory
performances and should postpone

any trips until next semester. The
Mandolin Club then saw that a trip
could not be successful, either finan
cially or musically.
Further, there was a recent offer
from Berkeley to accompany them
on their trip South. Owing to the
success of the trip last year and
the fact tlmt there is a strong feel
ing in the faculty that such a com
bination of rival university talent
is productive of the best results to
the University as a whole, and that
it could not make a successful trip
with our Glee Club under any cir
cumstances if the Berkeley Olee
Club went too, the Mandolin Club,
after consultation with the faculty
committee, decided to go with the
U. C. Glee Club. It obtained the
consent of the student body, ac
cepted Berkeley's offer, and both
clubs have made arrangements.
As the Executive Committee is the
agent of the whole student body
and has given its consent, upon
which contracts have been made
with an organization of another
university, it would be a serious
matter for the committee itself, as
a representative agent of the stud
ent body, to abrogate its contracts.
It is now a question between two
universities, and if the student
body here should abrogate the con
tracts of its responsible agents, it
may result in irreparable injury to
its reputation, and the relations of
the two universities may be
seriously affected.
There are many other considera
tions why an interference in this
case would result disastrously.
There is no more reason to believe
the Olee Club will be sacrificed by
the past action of the Executive
Committee, than that the Mandolin
Club will be sacrificed and great
injury result to the whole Univer
sity, by a hasty action on what stud
ents may present at a meeting to
overthrow the action of the respons
ible agent of the whole student
body. As the Mandolin Club was
not represented at all at the meet
ing of the Executive Committee
when it consented tohaveits action
submitted to the student body, it is
desired for the reputation of the
University that no hasty action be
taken at the student body meeting
for that purpose.
