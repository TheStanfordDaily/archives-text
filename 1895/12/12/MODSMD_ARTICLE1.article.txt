# STUDENT BODY MEETING.
## Committee System Adopted—Mandolin Club Will Stay at Home. 
### 
The largest meeting of the Asso
ciated Students which lias ever as
sembled in the chapel was called
to order this afternoon by Presi
dent Sheldon. According to pre
vious announcement, the primary
object of the meeting was to take
some action in regard to dishonesty
i n examinations.
Cathcart, '96, read the following
report from the Committee of Fif
teen appointed lust week to devise
some plan of action:
The Committee of Fifteen, ap
pointed by the president of the As
sociated Students on Dec.9, respect
fully submits the following report.
We recommend first the adoption
of these resolutions:
Whereas, The absence of distrust
ful espionage and the existence of
cordial relations of personal friend
ship between professors and stu
dents to a degree, almost unprece
dented in educational history, have
heretofore formed one of the most
attractive features of Stanford Uni
versity life; and
Whereas, The continuance of this
invaluable spirit here is greatly
jeopardized by the indifference
which we, as a student body, have
displayed toward frequent viola
tions of the general good faith by
which alone such relations can be
maintained;
]ie it resolved, That, as a stu
dent body, we do regret our past ap
parent ind ifferenee, toward cases of
dishonesty in examinations —an in
difference which has largely caused
the increase of such cases —and do
hereby express our determination
that from this time forth such dis
honesty shall cease among us.
That to this end we will use our
public and private influence to
prevent further violation of good
faith among us, and to merit, as a
student body, the continuance of
the respect and confidence of our
professors and instructors.
The committee further recom
mends that on condition of the
willingness of the Committee on
Student Affairs to place the matter
in the hands of the student body,
the Associated Students shall elect
a committee of seven members con
sisting of one post graduate, three
seniors, two juniors, and one soph
omore, which committee shall de
cide upon the guilt or innocence of
students accused of cheating in ex
aminations.
This committee shall depend en
tirely upon information volun
teered by individuals, and the
identity of the informant shall in
no case be revealed ; but no ac
cused student shall be adjudged
guilty before lie shall have had an
opportunity to defend himself be
fore the committee.
The subject was then thrown
open for discussion, and the argu
ment in favor of the scheme as
presented by the Committee was
taken up by Cathcart, who made a
stirring speech appealing to the
students to rally to the support of
the Committee in order that this
detestable practice might be abol
ished.
The argument for the opposition
was opened by (VXeil, ".>7, who ob
jected to the plan on the ground

that every person who was accused
should he confronted by his ac
cusers; he argued that this was a :
right which was recognized in all
systems of law, and that it would
he unjust to adopt any scheme in
which this right was withheld.
This was the trend of the argument
throughout the entire discussion,
and many brilliant speeches were
made which would have done credit i
to a session of the General Assein-;
bly; the addresses of the women,
especially, were right to the point.
After considerable discussion,
Stowe, '98, moved to amend the
original proposition by inserting
the following: That in every case
the accused person shall be con
fronted with the accusing witnesses, j
This amendment prolonged the j
discussion, and President Sheldon |
was several times obliged to warn j
the speakers that their remarks
must be short. The amendment
was finally brought to a vote, and
was carried by against 11)6.
After another amendment by
Anfenger, '96, which was lost, and !
more oratory, the original question
was adopted.
Cathcart, '96, then made the fol
lowing motion: That any person j
informing against any other person !
shall have the approval of the entire
student body. This was carried
unanimously.
Nominations for the Committee
were then declared in order, with
the following result: Arnold, Zion,
and Hinsdill, gr.; Mills, Cathcart,
Gregory, and .Miss Kohler, '96;
Palmer, Bell, Ross, Burcham, and
Miss Fielder, '97; Dole and Spinks,
'98.
While the tellers proceeded to
count the ballots, the attention of
the meeting was called to another
matter of almost equal importance, j
The Executive Committee at its |
meeting last evening decided to re-1
fer to the student body the entire!
difficulty between the Mandolin!
Club and Glee Club, which has oc
cupied so much of the attention of
the Committee lately.
To get the matter before the meet
ing, Collins moved that the question
be referred back to the Executive
[ Committee, as it was capable of rep
resenting the Associated Students.
A spirted discussion ensued and
personalities were used so freely
that the president was more than
once forced to show his authority
land call the belligerents to order.
1 Wigle and Wells led the discussion
j for the Mandolin Club, while Coch
ran and Abbot spoke for the Glee
j Club. The motion was finally lost,
j the Glee Club was pleased, and the
I spectators were becoming interested.
Wells then moved that the
I Mandolin Club be allowed to join
■with the Berkeley Glee Club in its
trip South, and the question was
again open. Wells spoke to his
motion, Pinkham produced the
i agreement, and Cochran and Ab
bot explained the position of the
Glee Club. Wigle closed the dis
cussion, and the matter was put to
a vote, with the result that the
Mandolin Club will stay at home.
The tellers announce the follow-
I ing as the result of the election for
; members of the Students' Commit
tee : Graduate, Arnold ; '96, Miss
Kohler, Gregory, Cathcart ; '97,
Miss Fielder, Ross ; '98, Dole.
