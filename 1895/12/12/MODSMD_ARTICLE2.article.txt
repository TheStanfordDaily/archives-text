# THE 						LAW DEPARTMENT.
## Unique in Its Relation to the University. 
### 
The novelty of the scheme of our
Law department and the apparent
success with which it is being car
ried out will justify a brief sketch
of the practical operation of the de
partment.
It has long been supposed |
by educators that the law I
must be studied in a school set
apart for that express purpose.
That law could be studied in a de-
partment of the university in the!
same way as history, economics, and
other such subjects seems never to
have been thought of until the cre
ation of an undergraduate depart
ment of law at Stanford University.
The idea of studying professional
subjects in a department of the uni
versity orginated, presumably, in
the mind of Dr. Jordan. He be
lieved that a lawyer should be
trained in other subjects than law;
that law should not be set apart
and studied by itself, but should lie
studied in connection with those
other subjects to which it is closely
related. To complete a regular uni
versity course before entering a law
school requires more time and ex
pense than most students can af
ford to spare. To follow a univer
sity course with office study has its
objections. It was thought by Dr.
Jordan that a student would be
more likely to continue the strictly
professional study of law with more
momentum if he should begin such
study while in the university, and
while studying other related sub
jects, than he would if he began
the study in an office after finish
ing a university course. Relieving
that this theory would prove prac
ticable, the Law department was
created as an experiment.
The objects of the department
I are: (1) To teach law for the pur
poses of citizenship; (2) to teach law
! for purposes of a profession.
The problem for the instructor in
putting this scheme into execution
was this: How far to teach law in
a technical sense and how far to
teach it in a popular sense. Law,
like all other subjects, may be made
a very dull subject, if not properly
taught ; while if it is properly
taught, it may be made very inter
esting.
It has been the object of Prof.
Abbott to teach sound technical
! law in an attractive way. if law
is taught accurately and attrae
j tively the man who studies it for
purposes of citizenship will be at
tracted, and the one who studies it
for purposes of a profession will not
be harmed. To put these ideas
into force the following means are
used.
1. A given subject is first covered
by lectures in order to give the stu
dent an idea of the questions in
i volved and the manner in which
they should be studied from cases
assigned.
2. Frequent reviews are given to
fix the principles in the mind.
3. Hypothetical questions are
written out and distributed among
the students in order to stimulate
independent research and to estab
lish fundamental principles.
Moot courts are organized by
those who expect to practice law.
Five moot courts are now in opera

tion, each having nine members.
Thesis work is done by those who
wish to study law for purposes of
citizenship, and by others who have
time.
There is a danger in studying
law in connection with other uni
versity subjects. The student is
supposed to spend about one third
of his time on law and two thirds
upon other subjects. The danger
is, that in assigning law work so
that a subject may be covered in
proper time, the time spent upon
other university subjects is likely
to be trespassed upon. Law re
quires more reading than many
subjects, hence the danger. To
avoid this difiiculty it has been
found necessary to extend courses
over a considerable length of time.
The professors in the depart
ment have attempted to stimulate
in the student, as a necessary
qualification for his profession, a
high sense of honor.
The Law department has a very
bright outlook. It is hoped that
within a very few years the strength
of this department will bear wit
ness of the soundness of the princi
ple on which it is based.
