The greatest student body meet
ing in Stanford's history has dealt
with the question of honor in ex
aminations, and has dealt with it
in the main satisfactorily. The
intense interest in the question
manifested, the tone of the speeches
made, and the general attitude was
such that we may confidently ex
pect that in the future compara
tively little cheating will be done
in examinations at Stanford.
Upon one important provision,
sentiment was almost equally di
vided. It seemed fora while that
the entire report of the committee
of fifteen might be rejected on ac
of the clause providing for with
holding from the accused the name
of the accuser. On that provision
the debate waxed fierce and furious.
No doubt there are many who be
lieve that the efficacy of the whole
plan was destroyed when the
amendment was carried; time and
experience will show which side
was right.
There are several reasons for
thinking that the scheme as
adopted may prove as successful
as have the forms in operation in
Eastern universities. That some
students will be deterred from re
porting cases by the knowledge
that the culprit will be given the
name of the accuser, cannot be
doubted. However, that need not
cause the system to break down;
and it certainly has some compen
satory effects. The terms " espion
age," " private detective system,"
etc., cannot be applied to the
amended scheme.
The individual who, in the face
of all the feeling manifested today
against dishonesty in examinations,
still has the inclination to use un
fair means in examinations, will
now have two strong reasons for
refraining from it. He knows that

general sentiment is against it, and
that while a few of his associates
may be on his low plane, the ma
jority of those who see him cheat
ing will consider him lacking in
loyalty and in honor. If lie has
the hardihood to defy public senti
ment, he will still know that there
may be some one among those who
chance to see the offence who will
have the moral stamina to report
him to the committee and to be
willing to face him in it. And woe
to him if there is.
Another strong reason for the
belief that the Stanford form of
control will succeed rests upon this
ground: In the interests of the cul
prit, the proceedings will be kept
quiet. The offender is the last
one who would be anxious to pub
lish them to the world. The charge
is made, the case is tried before the
committee, and the guilty man dis
appears from Stanford life. The
public only learns through the
valued columns of the Daily Palo
Alto that he ''has a leave of ab
sence," or he "has serious trouble
with his eyes," or "business affairs
have called him home." Many stu
dents will be found willing to face
the cheat before the committee who
would not do so if they were to be
made the targets of the vituperation
of a certain class of students to be
found in every instution.
At any rate, let us hope for the
best, and strive to make the Stan
ford plan a success; no one knows
but that it may prove to be incom
parably better than any other
tem in existence.
