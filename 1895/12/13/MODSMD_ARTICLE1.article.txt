# A 						Day of the San Jose Rose Carnival Offered Us.
## 
### 
The promoters of the Hose Carni
val to be held at San .lose May 7,
S, 9, and 10, are anxious to turn â– 
one day over t<> the students of j
Stanford I'niversity. Great prep-j
arations are being made to eclipse
all former efforts in this line, and
to produce a carnival that by its
beauty, attractiveness, and general
interest shall long be remembered
and be of lasting benefit to Santa'
Clara county and valley. It is I
thought to be fitting that Stanford ,
should have one day of the fourj
for its own.
It is required that two entertain
ments be provided by the students, j
One, in the afternoon, is to be of I
an athletic nature, a field-day and
possibly a baseball game, l'rizes;
will be offered, and the expenses of
the competing athletes will be paid.
At night it is desired that a
grand musical entertainment be
given, in which our happy family
of musical organizations will have
a chance to show the value of
music as a means of culture.
The Southern Pacific Company!
is interested in the success of the j
carnival and will grant extremely I
low rates and provide good train
accommodations. Entire control of
the day's entertainment will be left
in our hands, the only stipulation ;
being that it shall not be a money
making affair.

hi accordance with the motion
carried in the Student Body meet
ing yesterday the following have
been appointed a committee to take
charge of the Stanford day at the
San .lose Hose Carnival: C. F.
