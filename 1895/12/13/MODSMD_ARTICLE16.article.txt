As an answer to the many com
plaints against the massing of ex
aminations at the end of the semes
ter, many of the professors have,
this year, given their tests during
the last two weeks of the term or
have refrained from giving any
finals whatever. The result is that
a majority of the students will not
be rushed and crowded in the cus
tomary manner at the close of the
half. The faculty members are
deserving of gratitude for thus
lightening the work.
