The proposition that Stanford
shall abandon cardinal and adopt
some other color, strikes one as
supremely ridiculous, especially
when coining, as it does, from an
outsider who expects to work the
reform by growing sarcastic at our
expense. This latest agitator, whose
feelings are so jarred by the sight
of another college flaunting any
shade of red, even though quite dis
tinct from that of his alma water,
seems to think that, since we are
both color-blind and void of reason,
possibly we can be bluffed into
complaisance.
