At the meeting of the Coif Club
Saturday night the case of J. B.
Stanford et al. vs. City and County
of San Francisco, now pending
before the Supreme Court, was
argued, Hopkins and Wilson rep
resenting the plaintiffs, and Apple
white the defendants. The facts
involved are briefly as follows:
Plaintiffs were lessees of a cellar on
.Jesse street in which they stored
wall-paper. Defendants, through
the action of their Board of Super
visors, constructed a culvert along
said street after paving the same,
but failed to provide cesspools for
the escape of water into the sewers.
By reason of a heavy rainfall the
surface water was collected about
plaintiffs' premises, and for the
want of a means of escape into the
sewer, flowed into said plaintiffs'
cellar, doing material damages to
the stock of wall-paper. Action
was brought for damages by reason
of defendants' negligence in failing
to construct cesspools.
The judges who sat at the hear
ing of the case were Malcolm, Cul
ver, Walker, and Huber. After the
arguments the decision of the case
of A vs. B was read by Wilson.
Damages of $200 were allowed and
a permanent injunction granted.
