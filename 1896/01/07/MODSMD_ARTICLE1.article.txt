# The 						Vacation in the Halls.
## 
### 
The dry weather which the farm
ers are so deploring tended to de
crease greatly the number of those
remaining in the halls. Many of
those whose homes were too far
awav fora vacation tour enjoyed
trips to neighboring resorts or
rambling excursions among the
hills, which tended to reduce the
aggregate numbers. Probably En
cina averaged about thirty-live in
mates, and Roble about twentv
livc.
The weather was conducive to
exercise, and the tennis courts of
both halls were filled at all hours
of the day. Whist was a general
recreation among those so fortunate
as to have no "incompletes" to
work off. Then there were Christ
mas boxes galore, and as most of
the fortunate recipients invited in
their friends,there was a''feed" of
some kind going on almost every
night.
Christmas morning there was a
general distribution of presents at
lioble. Each girl contributed one
article to the general fund which
was divided on the "grab-bag"
plan. At 6:80 there was an old
time Christmas dinner, followed by
an informal reception and dance in
the Roble parlors. Numerous
pleasant little card parties were
given in Roble from time to time,
but the most noticeable social af
fair was iin informal dance which
occurred in the Roble gymnasium
Friday evening, Jan H. The gym
nasium was tastefully decorated
with greens and mistletoe, by the
committee in charge. Schubert's
Orchestra furnished the music.
About thirty couples were present.
The Enema ' stag-dances" were as
numerous as ever, and although
silks, laces, and feminine society
were conspicuous by their absence,
the dancing men in sweaters
seemed to enjoy the exercise.
Not the least noticeable feature
of the vacation was the fact that
meals for both halls were served in
Roble. With true Stanford social
chill, the men lined-lip on one side
of the dining-room, the women on
the other. A few hardy indi
viduals crossed the line, but these
were exceptions. It was noticeable,
however, that the seats facing
toward the centre of the room were
most popular on both sides of the
house. One dislikes so much to
face a vacant wall.
