The Daily Palo Alto in its
necessary change of management
each semester offers every opportu
nity for gradual and constant im
provement. Each new editor who
assumes charge must make certain
changes, for no two men look on
the running of one college paper in
exactly the same way. These
changes often amount to little, hut
the effect on the paper is ultimately
good, and it is due to this evolution
that the Daily Palo Alto has at
tained the present high standard it
occupies among college dailies of
the country. At no period in its
history did the paper give such
general satisfaction as it did under
its painstaking editor of last se
mester, and if that high grade can
lie maintained during the coming
semester, we shall feel that we have
cause for self-gratulation.
It will he the policy of the pa
per to earn the good will and es
teem of the students by giving
them the news they want, The
daily, however, is but an institution
of the students, and depends on
them for its existence. Each one
should therefore take sufficient in
terest in the paper to see that some
one of the staff gets whatever infor
mation of general interest he may
possess. Such concern in the
daily's well-being is often of more
value than any other possible in
terest one might express.
