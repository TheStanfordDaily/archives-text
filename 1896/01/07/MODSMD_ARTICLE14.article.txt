As the next few days are being
devoted by the students to arrang
ing their courses,it is well for them
to remember that an hour of good
physical work daily will greatly
aid them in safely carrying their
mental tasks.
It is not a matter of building up
their mental capacities alone that
will lead to the students' success,
but a union of both physical and
mental development when exer
cised in harmony.
When university life has closed,
it is well for the student if he has
prepared himself physically as well
as mentally to cope with the hard
ships lie is likely to encounter af
ter leaving college.
Physical training is not made
compulsory here, and too few stu
dents observe the danger of neglect
ing their physiques. A very small
proportion of our eleven hundred

students* register for systematic
work.
It is just as important that the
body be properly nurtured as that
the mind be rigidly cultivated.
Inasmuch as credit is allowed
here for university work, the stu
dent cannot excuse himself by af
firming his lack of time. It be
hooves every student, therefore, to
register at once for gymnasium
work.
