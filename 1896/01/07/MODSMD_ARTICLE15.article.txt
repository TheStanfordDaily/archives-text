Stimulated by the consciousness
of defeat, our debating societies
commenced last semester with a
determination to bring the lost cup
back to this side of the bay. Al
most all the best debaters in the
University announced themselves
as candidates, and the preliminary
debates were arranged with an ex
ceptionally strong array of talent
in the field. It was a body of men
of which this or any other college
might well have felt proud, and
the enthusiasm shown augured well
for our success in this year's con
test.
Somehow our enthusiasm has
strangely disappeared. Not only
is there less feeling among the soci
eties and less work among the men,
hut one or two individuals have
come forward and announced their
intention of withdrawing from the
contest. These men are not mere
tyros, whose work will be watched
only as a matter of encouragement
to new material; they are old wheel
horses. One of them, at least, is
practically sure of a place on the
team, and is a man upon whom,
more than upon any other single
individual, we have depended to
bring us this year's Victory.
We are aware of the fact that ill
ness, the reason given in the last
case, is the most valid of all good
excuses. Nevertheless, a special ef
fort should be made in this emergen
cy, since Senator Perkins' prize has
turned universal attention to the
contest of this year.
