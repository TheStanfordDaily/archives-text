President Darkness delivered a
short address in which he reviewed
the work of the academy for the
past year, which, he said, had been
noted for the activity of the mem
bers and the excellence of the work
performed.
President Jordan was asked as
to the future work of the academy,
and said: "First, I want to say that
however much Dr. Darkness may
have been criticised, there can be
no question in my mind that he has
been one of the most faithful ser
vants the academy has ever had.
For many years he has devoted all
iiis time to it, and has scarcely ever
thought of anything else.
"As to my own purpose, I can
only say that 1 accepted the presi
dency hoping to be able to help the
academy by helping science through
the academy. 1 wish to do all I
can in the way of encouraging orig
inal investigation. To that end we
must look to the development of
the museum, the library, and es
pecially to the employment of thor
oughly trained men as curators.
Another function of the academy is
the publication of the results of
original research. These have in
the past represented the best origi
nal work done in California, and
they will keep up with the growth
of research in the future. Last
year's work compares well with the
best in the world." â€”Cull.
