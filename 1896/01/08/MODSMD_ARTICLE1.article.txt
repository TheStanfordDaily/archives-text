With the beginning of ihe new
semester interest in baseball af
fairs is once more on the increase.
The captain and manager of the
team have already been doing some
preliminary work, and everything
will soon be in shape for the usher
ing in of the new season.
William L. McLaine, the cap
tain of this year's team, entered
Stanford with the Class of '96 in
September, 1892. Previous to com
ing to Stanford he attended the
public schools in San Francisco and
from there went to St. Matthew's
School, San Mateo, where he spent
live years, graduating in June, 1891.
He commenced playing hall in 1888
as a left-fielder and played on the
school team for four years, the last
two of which he played the position
of pitcher and captain. Since en
tering here, Capt. McLaine has had
great success in his position as
pitcher and has made the Varsity
each year with ease. Last year he
was the only twirler on the team,
but was never found wanting when
it came to winning a game. He
accompanied the famous team of
'94 on the Northern trip, alternat
ing in the box with Campbell and
Weldon. With the exception of
last year he has been a member of his
class team every season. Football
has also claimed some of his atten
tion. In his sophomore year he was
quarterback and captain of the
second eleven and this year played
left end on the '96 team.
Concerning the prospects for this
year Capt. McLaine is very non
committal. It is understood that
there will be several new candi
dates for the team, and that a few of
them might prove to be first
class players. However, it is a dif
ficult matter to forecast the strength
of the team, as the ability of each
of the new players is an unknown
quantity. Of last year's team only
four members are back, Young, '97,
Jeffs, '98, Pincus, '98, and McLaine,
'9(5. Of course the new team will
be materially weakened by the loss
of such good men as the Class of
'95 produced. In addition to the
members of the Class of '95, Ex-
Capt. Dyer, '97, and Weldon, '97,
have left college and this necessi
tates the formation of almost an en
tirely new team.
Practice for this year will com
mence next Monday afternoon at 4
o'clock and will continue live times
every week during the season in
stead of twice a week as was done
last year. No candidate will be al
lowed on the field without a uniform.
The manager and captain are go
ing to San Francisco Saturday to
purchase uniforms and necessary
supplies. Work on the grounds
will be commenced this week in
order to put them in shape for the
regular } tract ice.
