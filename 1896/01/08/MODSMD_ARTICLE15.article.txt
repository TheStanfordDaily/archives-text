It is, as a rule, very difficult fo
students to get back into the rou
tine of hard study after a vacation,
and, recognizing that fact, Stanford
professors have heretofore light
ened the work somewhat in the be
ginning of each half and increased
the burdens gradually as the stu
dents were able to stand them.
This wise policy seems to have
been neglected this half by several
of the professors, if impossibly long
tasks and exhaustive text study
can be taken as any indication.
With a semester ahead of us
nearly a third greater in length
than the one just completed, most
of the faculty members can ar
range work without difficulty, so
that students need not spend more
than the required two hours in
preparation for each recitation.
A word in regard to this mat
ter will be sufficient, as all
the professors have always, in the
past, shown a disposition to ar
range the work of their students as
may most easily be adapted to
their capacities.
