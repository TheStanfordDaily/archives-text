In his review of football on the
Pacific Coast, Casper \V. Whitney,
in Harper's Weekly, makes a charge
against Stanford which places him
in a ridiculous position with re
gard to his knowledge of the facts
on which the statement is based.
If it were true that we insisted on
tlie enforcement of the rule debar
ring from playing men who had
less than ten hours credit only
after one of our best men had been
injured in practice, then there could
be no doubt that our reputation as
sportsmen would suffer. But it is
not true.

Our faculty from the beginning,
and after it was known that Garton
would fall under the provisions of
the rule, insisted that the rnle be
enforced, and it was with the great
est difficulty that Berkeley was in
duced to sanction the agreement.
When they discovered that Simp
son and liall would he rendered
ineligible, they protested that the
rule was a bad one and should he
disregarded.
No one will deny that Mr. Whit
ney knows a good deal about foot
ball; it is evident in this case at
least that his information ema
nated from an irresponsible source,
lie must he blamed, however, for
overlooking the fact that in our
coach we had a man who is as de
sirous of pure athletics as he him
self is.
