The Berkeley (J lee Club did not.
go South after all. As predicted l>y
those interested at the time, when
the student body refused to allow
the Stanford Mandolin Club to
take the trip to Los Angeles with
them, they were obliged to abandon
the proposed undertaking, and by
so doing have shown more forcibly
than could be done in any other
way how dependent they 'are on
Stanford in the way of musical as
sistance. It is a well-known fact
that one organization of Ibis kind
can not undertake a trip of any
consequence without losing money.
The Berkeley (lice Club tried it
two years ago and brought home
with them a deficit of between two
and three hundred dollars. A pro
gram to be a success must include
; both vocal and instrumental mu
! sic, and as Berkeley was unable to
! furnish the latter, their glee club
11
was obliged to abandon the trip
this year. It is to be regretted that
| discord among our own organiza
| tions prevented their making a tour
(luring the holidays; but with a
i long semester before them and
bright prospects ahead, all difi'er
j ences should be made up and every
| energy extended toward taking the
I trip during Easter vacation.
A conciliatory disposition on the
part of the members of both organi
-1 zations would bring two of our best
! student enterprises together for
i their own good and for the good of
| our alma water.
