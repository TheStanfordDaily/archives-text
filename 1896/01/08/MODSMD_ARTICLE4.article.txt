But few students in the Univer
sity seem to realize the amount of
work accomplished outside of regu
lar courses, while in fact some of
the best efforts are directed through
different students' clubs. The En
gineering clubs, Laboratory clubs,
Geological club, numerous Law
clubs, and many others, do almost
as important work outside the class
room as is done under class in
struction.
At the present time the Mechan
ical Engineers' Club is one of the
most successful. Roper, '96, is
president of the club, which is com
posed of fifteen members. The
club has been organized about two
months and is fairly under way for
good work this semester.
The members meet every two
weeks, when papers are read which
are prepared by different individ
uals. Reports are given and gen
eral discussions indulged in by all
the members concerning work in
that special branch of study,
Roper, ".Mi, president; Uenne,'97,
vice-president; McCord, '90, secre
tary and treasurer; Lesley, '90;
Bunker, '90; Roy, '90; Lawrence,
'90; Saunders, '97; Kimball, '97;
Young, '97; Black, '97; Wood '90;
Connon, '97; Toombs, '90; Van
Norden, '96, are Mechanical Engi
neers.
The Civil Engineers' Club is
composed of ten members, with
Parcel!, '90, as president. All the
members are advanced students
and work hard to make their club
a success. It has been organized
for two years, with a limited mem
bership of fifteen.
The objects are: the promotion
of an engineering disposition among
the students; to brin£ them in
touch with engineering problems;
to teach them to (x press their opin
ions on engineering structures in a
clear manner.
Meetings are held every two
weeks, when two or three reports
are given on existing or proposed
structures. The last meeting of
each semester is given over to a so
cial time. Following is a list of
the members: Pa reel 1, '96, Pratt,'97,
ttockhold, '90, Brown, '97, Pope,
'97, McDonnell, '90, 11. Z. Osborne,
Jr., '97, \Y. L. Brown, '90.
