The activity which students are
manifesting in the formation of de
partment clubs is commendable in
every respect. It is only bv such
means that the members can keep
pace with the progress of the world
in investigation, and become ac
quainted with the great bulk of
contributions to science and litera
ture that is added every year.
80 far there has been but one or
ganization in the field of literature,
the Shakspere Club, formed last
year. Students in engineering,
physiology, zoology, and geology
have active and wide-awake socie
ties, while students in other depart
ments are beginning to organize.
The weather is a threadbare
topic, but at present we trust we
may be pardoned for referring to
the sunny days and star-lit nights
■'Old Probs." has been giving us of
late. As students of Stanford we
feel that we are favored beyond the
greater part of the student world,
in being surrounded by such cli
matic conditions as obtain herein
the Santa Clara valley. To think
of our enjoying here in mid-winter
practically all the beauties of sum
mer is enough to turn the students
of Eastern universities green with
envy. Probably nine tenths of us
do not properly appreciate the
splendid climate we enjoy. It is
when we turn our thoughts back to
wards our friends in the East and
picture the delightful succession of
blizzards, thaws, frosts, and rains
they are now experiencing, that we
are most thankful for the glories of
the Golden State.
