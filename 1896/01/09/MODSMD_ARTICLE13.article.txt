The fact that so many new stu
dents are entering the I niversityat
this time of the year shows that
Stanford is slowly hut surely ex
tending its influence and name
throughout the country, and that
people are everywhere becoming
more convinced of the permanency
and worth of the institution. We
whose interests are hound up in the
fortunes of the University have
never had so much as a douht that
the University will continue to
stand as a. perpetual monument'of
learning to the memory of its il
lustrious founders; but the fact that
so many outsiders, who former!}',

through misguided information,
hud been inclined to question its
stability, are now ready to admit
the contrary, is a source of much
self-congratulation and can only
add that much the more to the
depth of our convictions.
The suit lias not yet been settled
nor can it be told with accuracy
when it will be. It has hut lately
suffered another postponement;
but we are confident that when the
decision does come, it will but aug
ment the faith that every individ
ual has placed in the staunchness
of our college.
