# Another Danger From Football.
## 
### 
In order to save the nation's ar
mament from being sacrificed to
the pursuit of football, the director
general of the ordnance factories
has felt himself compelled to issue
the following warning to workmen
in the Royal arsenal, Woolwich:
"Owing to the great inconvenience
caused by employes absenting
themselves without leave on the oc
casion of local football matches,
the director of the ordnance facto
ries has decided that any person
absent without leave on such an
occasion in the future will, for the
lirst offense, be suspended one or
more days, and that any repetition
of the offense will be more seriously
dealt with."-~London 'I'elcifraph.
