The Hastings. — it is a well
known fact that the most prom
inent clothing firm in San Fran

corner of Montgomery and Sutter
streets. They have the reputation
of square dealing, low prices, and
first-class goods. Goods are just
as represented. They also make a
specialty of gentlemen's furnishing
goods. Our readers will do well by
patronizing "The Hastings."
Plants.
Full assortment, best kind, rea
sonable prices. Sunset plants are
grown to sell, not to keep, and the
good people of the University and

elsewhere for plants than to the
nurseries of the Sunset Seed & Plant

creek.
