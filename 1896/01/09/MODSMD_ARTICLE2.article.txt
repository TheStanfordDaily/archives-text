The Geological 01 til» has been in
existence for four years and em
braces a membership of about
twenty-five earnest workers. Roy
Moore, '1)8, is president, and S. A.
Gilchrist, 'US, secretary.
The objects of the club are to
promote good fellowship among the
students in geology, to study geo
logical problems of local import
ance and economic value, and to
promote discussions upon general
subjects. The club meets once in
two weeks, and its assemblies,
which are open to all students in
geology and to others interested,
take the place of the geological
seminary. Papers and short, in
formal discussions are the princi
pal features of the program.
Nearly every member of the
Geological Club undertakes to visit
some part of the country which is
of unusual geological and economic
interest, and many interesting re
ports are the result. During last
year the most notable reports were
as follows: Chris. Ilenne, "J7,
''Alaska"; Dr. J. I\Smith,''Paleon
tology of California"; lliter, '!«>,
"Grand Canon district"; Buck.

Silverton mining camp"; Higgles,
'96, "Artesian wells on the campus";
and others having a bearing on
local geological features.
The Zoological Club was organ
ized during the lirst year of the
University's existence. Its main
purposes are to explore the im
mediate vicinity of the University
and to obtain knowledge of animals
which live in this neighborhood, as
well as to gain experience in field
work. The club meets every two
weeks and discusses topics of zoolog
ical interest to the members. Al
though the work is purely volun
tary the club is nevertheless one of
the most aetiveorganizations in the
University. The membership in
cludes all students interested in
zoological work and consists of
about forty members. J. O. Snv
der, '96, is president and R. W.
Doane, '96, secretary.
