Now that the registration of new
students is about completed and
the work of the courses well under
way, it is to be hoped that every
student has chosen the major under
which he expects to graduate with
some definite end in view. To
change one's major is to work an
injustice to your previous major
professor as well as to yourself.
On graduation after a couple of
such changes you feel equally fitted
for all and insufficiently grounded
for any profession. Every student
has an inclination toward one sub
ject or department more than to an
other. He feels that if there is any
thing in him it must be in that par
ticular line, and it would be wise for
him to waste no time in changing
about from department to depart
ment.
