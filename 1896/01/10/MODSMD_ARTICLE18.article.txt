It lias been the policy of this
paper to avoid, as far as possible,
all display of bad feeling toward
our older sister university. Dur
ing last semester the Berkeley
papers heartily cooperated with
us in this matter; and during all
that time, even in the thick of the
football season, there was not a sin
gle utterance on either side which
voiced anything beyond natural,
healthy rivalry.
It. is a matter for regret, there
fore, that a Berkeley paper came
out in a recent issue with an ut
terly unwarranted attack on prom

inent Stanford track men. The
article in question criticised several
of our athletes by name, ridiculed
their abilities, and boasted of the
number of men at the University;
of California who could "run away"]
from our best athletes.
We would like to remind the j
author of the effusion in question j
that Stanford has in the past been i
as uniformly victorious on the
diamond as has Berkeley on the
track. Nevertheless this would not
justify us in slandering the best
U. C. baseball men, or in boasting
of our own champions. When the
University of California teams
are winners in every sport, the
editor of the Berkeley paper will
have some excuse for exultation.
From the manly and sensible at
titude assumed by their papers last
semester, from their moderation in
one or two trying incidents during
the football season, and from the
fair and just criticism which the
Occident printed regarding the
Thanksgiving game, we are led to
hope that the editor's time was over
crowded that day with "finalex's,"
and that some freshman assistant
took advantage of his chief's ab
sence to air his own misdirected
enthusiasm.
