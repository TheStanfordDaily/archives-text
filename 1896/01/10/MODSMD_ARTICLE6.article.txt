# A 						New Business Manager.

### 
At a meeting of the Board of
Control of the Daily Palo Alto
this afternoon, George B. Wilson,
the present business manager, tend
ered his resignation on account of
his appointment by the faculty
to the office of treasurer of the Stu
dents' Hoarding Club and because
of pressure of University work.
Ife stated that the business of the
paper was being left in good shape,
and made a somewhat detailed
statement of the financial condi
tion of the daily. He introduced
Mr. Zion, who had gone over the
accounts, to bear him out in his re
marks. Mr. Zion stated that af
fairs were in excellent shape, con
sidering the time of year, and that
the manager's books were in good
condition. He did not think that it
was a bad time of year fora man
ager to withdraw, and believed that
the right man could make the bus
iness a success by taking hold at
the present time.
The resignation was then accepted
and a motion passed that thechair
nian appoint an auditing commit
tee to go over the books and ac
counts of the retiring manager, and
to report to the Board at a later
meeting.
F. W. Morrison, '96, and C. F.
Aaron, '97, were nominated for the
office of business manager. The
vote was by ballot, which on being
counted showed that Mr. Morrison
had five to Mr. Aaron's three.
The chairman of the Board, af
ter announcing the result, suggested
the advisability of having the bus
iness manager make a report to the
Board at stated times, and further
suggested that if it lay within the
power of the Board, a permanent
committee be selected to go over
the books, and that the books
should be the property of the pa
per and not of the individual.
The suggestion met with favor,
and will be acted upon, incase it is
found that the constitutional pro
vision will admit of such action by
the Board.
