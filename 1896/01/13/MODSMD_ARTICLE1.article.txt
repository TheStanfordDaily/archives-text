# The
						Preliminary Debate.
## 
### 
The first of the preliminaries for
t lie Inter-Collegiate Debate was
held in the chapel Saturday even
ing. The question was: "Resolved,
That the United States Senators
should be elected by popular vote."
Professor Barnes presided and in
troduced the speakers in the follow
ing order:
.1. T. Burcham reviewed the or
ganization of the Senate, the ideas
in the minds of the frame rs of the
Constitution, and the points where
in the present system failed.
Elections by the Legislature were
governed entirely by the party cau
cus, every member of the party be
ing bound to support the party
nominee. Local and Federal is
sues were united and state ques
tions, lost sight of in the desire for
the election of Senators.
A. M. Cathcart maintained that
the burden of proof rested with the
affirmative to show that there were
any great evils in the present sys
tem and that there would be any
less evil in the system proposed,
lie took up the various arguments
in favor of the new system, J,lie out
cry against the use of money in
Legislative elections, the charge
that the present system is undem
ocratic, and held that the effect of
election by tfie people was easily
observed in municipal affairs, in
the State Legislature, and even in
the House of Representatives; that
the Senate was needed as a con
servative branch, and that giving
it over into the hands of the people
would not only take away this fea
ture of our governmental system,
but would also bring about a grad
ual destruction of state sovereignty.
Nello Johnson, who spoke next
for the affirmative, recited the acts
of fifteen State Legislatures petition
ing for the change, to show that
there was a manifest distrust of the
Senate today, and claimed that if
the people demanded the right to
elect their Senators no power on
earth could prevent them. He
sides wasting time in their selection,
the will of the people is not duly
heard; instances were given in Con
necticut and Rhode Island where a
minority of the people were able to
choose the United States Senator.
As to the caucus, a majority could
name the candidate, who might not
be the choice of a majority of the
people. If the Senators represent
the people, the people should have
a chance to vote for them; the Leg
islature may be corrupted but you
can not corrupt a whole people.
(i. L. Williams, speaking for the
negative, deplored the loss of rev
erence for the United States Senate,
which he attributed to the presence
of a new school of politicians. He
vindicated the Senate on the ground
that it best fulfills the condition of
the time; that it is as good as it can
be â€”no stream can be better than
its source; that the evils did not
arise from the manner of selection,
hence the remedy must be sought
in the Legislature itself; and that it
was absolutely essential that the
states be represented in their sov
ereign capacity. In closing he paid
a glowing tribute to the character
of the men whose names have
graced the rolls of the United
Suites Senate.
AW P. Harrington held that the

opposition to the change came from
the selfishness of those who owed
their positions to the present system,
who had done nothing to deserve
the support .of the people, and who
would stand no chance of election
in a popular contest. As to the
origin of the system it was the only
thing possible at that time, owing
to the impossibility of holding a
popular election over a large ter
ritory. The character of the Hen
ate would be in no way altered by
the change; there would still be two
representatives from each state;
they would be elected for six years;
and the Senate would have equal
power with the House; the change
would only allow the people to
choose men to represent their in
terests.
Cecil Smith, the closing speaker
for the negative, insisted that the
chief reason for the present forma
tion of the Senate was the need of
a check on the other branches of
government; that the present sys
tem was the result of a compromise,
a union of the liberal and conserva
tive elements. It was not a mere
matter of detail, bit'- a momentous
change. The evils of our present
form of government are more uni
versal than in the Senate; if the
present system has failed, it is due
not to the Senate, but to the Legis
lature. His remarks received long
continued applause.
Decision will be given at the con
clusion of the final preliminaries,
Saturday, Jan. 18.
