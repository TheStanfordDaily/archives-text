As a matter of routine work, it
may be of value to new students to
call their attention to the "schedule
system" formerly used almost uni
versally by careful students. By
this plan a regular time each day
was set aside for the studying of
each subject, and was never, if pos
sible, departed from. It was found
that such a system not only tended
to the formation of regular habits,
but that it actually rendered study
ing easier. The many-sided col
lege life of today, with its numerous
and unexpected calls on the stu
dent's time, makes it impossible to
follow implicitly such a course,
but it is nevertheless to be recom
mended to those who desire to be
exact and painstaking in their
work.

There has been considerable talk,
and it is very likely that the plan
will be adopted, of giving a dance
in the near future for the benefit of
the baseball fund. As is well
known the coffers of the baseball
management are in a condition of
pronounced emptiness, and it is
more than necessary that some
steps be taken to restore the de
pleted exchequer. The student
body is at present laboring under a
debt of several hundred dollars and
it is obvious that very little aid
may be relied on from that quarter.
Therefore the only possible way
of helping baseball interests out of
the difficulty seems to be some such
a one as a popular dance in the
gymnasium. Such a plan should
meet with the earnest support of
every student, for it seems to be
the only way in which baseball can
be put upon a firm footing at Stan
ford this year. If we are to beat
Berkeley, we must have the neces
sary money and materials with
which to put*our best team in the
field; without these it is utterly im
possible to carry on the work. It
is hoped that the season of 1896
will not be the first to mar our well
earned baseball record. Let every
one who is interested in baseball
affairs and who wishes to see the
Cardinal again triumphant over
Berkeley assist in placing our base
ball finances in the best possible
condition.
