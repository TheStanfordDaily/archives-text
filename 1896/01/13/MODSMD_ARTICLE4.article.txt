# A 						Strike Averted

The student waiters employed in
Encina and Roble Halls sprung a
surprise Sunday morning. Before
serving breakfast they announced
to the steward, through a spokes
man, that they wanted board and
room for their services instead of
board alone as formerly. Mr. Tait
was given until eleven o'clock to
consider the proposition, and it was
announced that, failing a favorable
settlement, the student waiters
would go on a strike. One of the
leaders of the movement said to a
Palo Alto representative: "We
have nothing to say of Mr. Tait's
treatment of us. We simply feel
that the pay is not sufficient. We
have to work about four hours
each day and receive for this only
our board, while students in other
dining-rooms on the campus get
board and room for the same
amount of work. There are fifteen
student waiters at Encina and Ro
ble. Four of these act as regular
waiters, and receive board and five
dollars per month ; the rest are
'busses' or assistants, and receive
board only for their services. The
professional waiters are paid thirty
dollars a month, board, and room.
Of course they work longer hours
and are more skilled, but at the
same time we consider the dispar
ity too great."
Before noon the steward met the
strikers and a compromise was ar
ranged. Half the price of room
rent in the halls is to be paid the
student ''busses" for the present
calendar month. On Feb. Ist Mr.
Tait promises to pay the sum de
manded, provided the receipts from
the halls justify it. The dwellers
in Encina, who had been expected
to file into the serving-room and
bring out their own duck and ap
ple-sauce, were served at dinner as
usual, and peace reigns supreme in
the dining-room.
