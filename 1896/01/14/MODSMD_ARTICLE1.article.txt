# Righteousness, the Sum of Religion.
## 
### 
Rev. George B. Hatch of Berke
ley delivered the Sunday sermon,
taking his text from Paul's Epistle
to the Romans, i, 17: ''For therein
i> the righteousness of God revealed
from faith to faith: as it is written,
The just shall live by faith."
According to the speaker there is
a great confusion of ideas ;is to the
vital thing in religion. Sometimes
it is called spirituality, sometimes
love: sometimes it is simply to be
saved, sometimes it is a creed; but
all these are embraced in the term
righteousness. There can be no
love or spirituality without right
eousness. There can be nothing
good or beautiful except where
righteousness is.
In Jesus we find our best exem
plification of righteousness. It is
absolute disinterestedness. Com
plete absence of any thought for
self —the sole aim to do good for
others —that is righteousness.
It would have been easy for Jesus
to gain a foremost place in his day,
but had lie done so the poor would
have had no helper, sinners no sa
vior. Men before bis day had con
sulted self-interest; men since his
day have consulted self-interest; to
(b) so has been the immemorial cus
tom of the human race; but Jesus
did not do so; he could not and be
righteous.
Righteousness involves salvation.
It is the only path to salvation.
Conformity to rules and observ
ances laid down by the churches
can avail nothing. The idea that
salvation is merely a matter of set
tling up accounts and of entering
into a state of eternal bliss is false
and pernicious. We work out our
salvation as we go through life by
simple acts of lowliness, such as
characterized the life of Jesus.
Spirituality also is included in
righteousness, and like salvation it
can be attained only through right
eousness. Wealth is thought by
some people to confer a claim to
righteousness and social position;
even intelligence is so considered by
some Hut to God all are equal —
the meek and the mighty, the rich
and the poor. His only question
is," What have you been doing"?
And in his eyes the beautiful and
sublime deeds are just such as Jesus
did when he was on earth.
Let us then in our lives try to
emulate Jesus, working constantly
for the good of others, training our
selves daily in the gymnasium of
self-sacrifice, striving to lill every
moment with self-forgetfullness.
