Ik the attendance at the debate
this evening is not better than it
was Saturday evening it will be
time for the president of the Asso
ciated Students to call another
meeting for the purpose of arousing
enthusiasm. The disinclination of
students to support an enterprise of
this kind is even more sadly felt in
this instance than it was on the
football field. When the team was
compelled to play night after night
before an empty grandstand, there
were some grounds on which a
plausible explanation could be
given. Hut at this time of the year
when class work is not over op
pressive nor the weather uncom
monly bad, a half-filled lecture
room is discouraging to the speak
ers, disheartening to those who feel
that Stanford's reputation is at
stake, and unworthy of the senti
ment for which our institution has
heretofore been noted.
