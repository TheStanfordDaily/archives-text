At the beginning of a new se
mester every one is more or less a
'"dig.'' It is human nature to go to
extremes. We are putting an extra
touch on our German, or getting in
as much time as the law allows in
the Library, or taking an especial
pride in keeping ahead of our labo
ratory hours. By the end of the
semester we will be at the other ex
treme, when a few "cuts" will seem
somewhat excusable, or a badly
prepared lesson a matter not es
pecially to be deplored. Few of us,
it must be admitted, have reached
that itleal state wherein a certain
and definite amount of work is
done each day. Perhaps it is just
as well that the rest of us are put
ting on extra pressure just now.
The spring months are coming,
bringing their round of social and
athletic recreation, when one can
put in spare time most pleasurably.
It will be a consolation in those
days to think that we leave behind
us a record that will permit us to
rest on our oars a while.
