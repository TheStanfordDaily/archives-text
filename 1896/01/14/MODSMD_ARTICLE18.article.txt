It is sometimes questioned
whether the student who takes
more than fifteen hours is acting
wisely. Certainly a student would
be seldom justified in undertaking
more than fifteen hours if lie were

at all sure that he could receive
credit for just fifteen hours each
semester for four years. But the
possibility of losing a few credits
during one's course makes it neces
sary to take a few hours extra to
insure graduation at the proper
time, without undue work and
worry the last semester.
No doubt it would be the part of
wisdom for most college students to
spend five years on the regular
course prescribed for four years, but
as long as students are divided into
freshman, sophomore, junior, and
senior classes, and these classes
lead up to each other, it is not
likely that ambitious students will
consent to drop behind their class
mates. It is all well enough to say
that no one should pay attention to
credits; but until it is no longer the
policy of schools to give credits and
grant degrees, it is useless to blame
the average student for allowing
these considerations to seriously in
fluence his work in college.
