lioaton, Muss., .Jan. 13. —At the
annual meeting of the Universalist
Clul» held at the Thorndike tonight
the offer of the Lei and Stanford
University to establish a chair in
Universalist theology in return for
m fund of #40,000 came up. Rev.
F. 11. Roblin made ;i motion that a
committee of three he appointed to
raise $10,000 which, with $10,000
raised for that purpose in the West
and $20,000 left hy the late Father
Throop of I'asadena, Cal., will
complete the sum required. After
some debate the motion was passed.
—Call.
[ In regard to the above dispatch
Dr. .lordan states that he made the
same proposition to all theological

clubs three years ago, i.e., that if
they raised the proper funds and
a Unwed t lie occupants of t heir chairs
to he selected by Stanford officials,
chairs might be established here.
This is evidently the outcome of
one of these propositions, though
Dr. Jordan has had no private in
telligence on the subject. —Editor.]
