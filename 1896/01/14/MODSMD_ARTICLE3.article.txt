Speaking of the recent meeting of
the State Teachers' Association, the
Oakland Saturday Xiyht, in its is
sue of January 11, has this to say:
"There has never been a better pre
siding officer than Professor Earl
Barnes. With a respect for honest
effort whenever it was apparent;
with a great fair-mindedness, a
keen appreciation of the ability of
others, a great fairness to his fellow
teachers; with a strength of thought
and a certain brilliancy, he seemed
to intensify what must have been
in any case a success.
Professor Barnes' address'was able,
showing an enthusiasm, a happy
optimism, that in themselves are
the first, the strongest element,
tending toward success."
