# SECOND PRELIMINARY DEBATE
## Arguments of the Different Speakers. 
### 
The second of the preliminaries!
for the Inter-Collegiate Debate
took place in the chapel yesterday
evening. The question was: "Re
solved, That the United States
should build, own, and operate, the
Nicaragua Canal."' I'rof. Murray
presided and introduced the speak
ers of the evening.
Mr. Sheldon, tin* first speaker on
the affirmative, opened the debate
of the evening by discussing the ef
fect of the Nicaragua Canal upon
the commerce of the world, show
ing how in the hands of America it
could be used as a handicap upon
foreign commerce. The proposed
route has great natural advantages
over all others. Whether or not
the government operates the canal,
is a question vital to the commer
cial transactions of the whole coun
try. In fact, when completed, it
will bean important and essential
waterway of the United States.
Much time would also be saved in
the building of the canal. If built
by a corporation it would take at
leiist nine years; the United States
can complete it in five years as cal
culated. If owned by a corporation
there is a.so fear of its being taken
by foreign powers. Governmental
interference in the Latin-American
countries has not hitherto been the
policy of the United States. We
should lend a helping hand.
Mr. J. F. Haffey, leading for the
negative, maintained that it would
not be safe for the United States to
extend its territory and jurisdiction,
for fear that it would lead to cor
ruption of governmental officers.
The canal could not be built and
maintained as cheaply in the hands
of the federal government as if
undertaken by a private corpora
tion, and for the furthering of com
merce we need a cheap toll-rate.
Furthermore, the United States
should maintain its neutrality and
preserve its national honor. Should
the canal be built by private parties,
it would be in American hands
nevertheless. Government owner
ship would only be another form of
socialism, dangerous to the Repub
lic. Foreign governments would
interfere, if this country would pre
sume to take a step toward holding
the canal. To build the- canal
through the medium of the govern
ment would be putting our nat
ional honor at stake.
F. C. Doty, speaking for the af
firmative, stated that there were
three phases to this question: the
engineering phase, the national
phase, and the financial phase. No
other nation in the world would re
ceive the benefit that the United
States would. This country needs
the canal for self protection. Mr.
Dotv then illustrated England's
policy by its interference in Central
America, and stated that the safety
of the United States lay in antici
pating England in the building of
the canal. It would save 10,000
miles of travel by steamer from San
Francisco to New York, and bring
us nearer to Liverpool and the
great ports of the Old World, and
thus be of incomparable advantage
to the Pacific Coast. That the
people of the United States are in
favor of governmental ownership is

shown by the number of petitions
continually sent to Congress asking
that body to take action upon the
question.
R. E. Outealt, the closing speaker
for the negative, held that private
ownership and control would be
more efficient than public control,
because then it would not be an ob
ject of international dispute. If in
the hands of the government every
obstacle would be placed by other
governments in the way of its suc
cessful operation. We could not,
with security, discriminate between
American and foreign commerce.
If in the hands of the government,
it would l>e considered as war
spoils, and the government would
have to hold it by means of war
ships. The provisions of the Mon
roe Doctrine call for our neutrality
in this enterprise. To keep it free
from litigation the canal must not
be in the hands of any one country.
If controlled by private ownership,
by its location and the attitude the
United States takes towards the
Spanish American powers, it would
be as great an advantage to us,
without involving us in interna
tional difficulties.
The final preliminaries will take
place in the chapel next Saturday
night, and the decisions will be
rendered.
