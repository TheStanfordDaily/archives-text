It has been suggested that the
long-needed board walk from the
rear of Encina to the Co-op. might
he obtained by raising a sufficient
sum among those stopping at the
big dormitory. The expense would
be comparatively nothing to the in
dividual subscriber, and this im
provement, which would save time
and trouble to hundreds of stu
dents, could be made at once. A
subscription list is always regarded
with aversion here, but in such a
good cause as this, each one remem
bering how much individual bene
fit he would derive from its being
carried into effect, there should be
no trouble in raising the amount
required to lay this plank walk.
