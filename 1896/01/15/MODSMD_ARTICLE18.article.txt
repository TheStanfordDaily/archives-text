Fresh reports of thievery com
mitted in Encina during vacation
continue to roll into the office of
the Hall each day. There have heen
rare and isolated cases heretofore
of stealing, hut it has never before
been carried on to such a wholesale
extent. One man who was absent
lost during the holidays over thirty
dollars worth of books and cloth
ing, and fully a score of students
report missing articles of more or
less value.
It does not follow that, because
these offenses were committed in
the Hall, the thieves were necessa
rily students. Encina is free of ac
cess at all hours of the day and
night. The few inmates were so
scattered over the large building
during vacation that one might
have looted a room in broad day
light without much danger of de
tection. The night watchman is
near the building only a few min
utes in every hour, and he would
have had trouble in distinguishing
a burglar among the numerous in
dividuals who crept through the
windows or crawl up the tire es
capes after 10:30 p.m. Therefore,
until the contrary is proved, stu
dents should have the benefit of the
doubt.
Every effort, however, should be
made to detect the criminal, and in
case he is apprehended, his punish
ment should lit his prolonged crim
inal career.
