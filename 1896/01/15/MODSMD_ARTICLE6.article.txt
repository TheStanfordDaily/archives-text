A regular business meeting of the
Gymnasium Club was held Monday
night and the matter discussed of
obtaining a boxing and fencing in
structor for the club.
This organization was effected in
October and is preparing to do ex
tended and beneficial work this
semester. It began with eleven
charter members and has since
added several new members to its
rolls.
Meetings are held weekly, the
time being devoted to apparatus
work and to the classification of
men as to their fitness for special
work. In addition to this there
will be special instruction in fenc
ing, boxing, and wrestling. Special
apparatus will be obtained by the
club and several pieces have been
ordered by the gymnasium; with
the aid of the regular instructor
and the additional equipments the
club can not fail to make a good
showing.
There will be a special meeting
of the club next Friday evening in
order to fix a time for regular
meetings. Visitors are cordially in
vited to all regular gymnasium
meets.
