# REPORT OF THE AUDITING COMMITTEE.
## A 						General Statement on the Handling of Our Finances. 
### 
THE ASUHER S ACCOUNTS.
The committee have given Treas
urer Hinsdill's accounts a search
ing examination. The results are
extremely satisfactory and show an
efficient and economical adminis
tration of funds. The expendi
tures are all covered by vouchers
in such a way as to make fraud im
possible. The accounts also pre
sent evidence of continuous effort to
keep expenses at the lowest possible
limit.
FOOTBALL MAN AGE \I E NT.
Some little confusion has arisen
in the financial dealings between
the treasurer and the football man
ager. In theory the treasurer is to
have sole control of expenditures.
In practice this is impossible, as
emergencies may arise requiring
immediate action in the absence of
the treasurer. At the present time
the manager is not allowed a
voucher book, and consequently his
bills can not be subjected to the
same scrutiny that is given to the
treasurer's accounts. Although
the privilege was in no way abused
during the present season, it might
be the source of evil in the future.
The committee therefore recom
mend that action be taken in the
form of adopting some device to
meet the exigencies of the case.
The Executive Committee should
also define the term ''personal ex
penses 1 ' in such a manner as to
leave no ground for misunderstand
ing in the mind of the manager.
Items for postage and telegrams
were placed in the general expense
account during the present year,
while the Executive Committee un
derstood that all such Kills were to
be covered by the manager's allow
ance. The committee desire to
place on file their belief in the ca
pacity and general business ability
of the manager for the present
season.
OLD ACCOUNTS.
The baseball accounts of the two
preceding seasons came before the
committee to audit. The commit
tee has no reliable means of verify
ing accounts two years old, and
this practice tends to place the stu
dent body treasury at the mercy of
former managers. As to whether
the responsibility for tliis negli
gence rests on the managers them
selves or on former student body of
ficials, the committee has no means
of judging. It recommends, how
over, in the future that all such old
accounts be turned over to the stu
dent body for strict official investi
gation.
CONSOLIDATION OF DEBTS.
it has been the practice hitherto
to allow outstanding bills against
the student body to remain over
from one year to another awaiting
settlement. The present adminis
tration is paying debts four years
old. This practice of allowing old
bills to remain unpaid injures the
student body credit with the bus
iness public and affords numerous
opportunities for fraud. The com
mittee therefore recommends that
sufficient money be borrowed from
some bank of good repute to pay

off all the liills outstanding at the
end of the present season.
INJURED PLAYERS.
Hitherto it has been the custom
for the treasurer lo pay all hills
contracted by injured football
players out of the ordinary funds
of the season. Inasmuch as the
University possesses' an organiza
tion devoted to this special pur
pose, the committee recommends
that this matter he placed in the
hands of the Students' Guild.
A thorough system of vouchers
for expenditures was worked out
during Treasurer Hoover's term of
office which prevents any form of
looseness in paying out money.
Regarding receipts from games,
however, the student body has no
such protection. The committee
has no means of knowing how tick
ets are disposed of. Arrangements
could undoubtedly be made with
the printer, having him certify to
the executive committee the num
ber of tickets printed. The treas
urer could then be held accountable
for the disposal of the tickets.
PRESENT CONDITION OF FINANCES.
The treasurer's figures will ap
pear in Friday's issue in detail.
It is only necessary to anticipate
that portion which deals with the
outcome for the year. With ordi
nary sources of revenue the student
body will be from seven to eight
hundred dollars in debt at the end
of the present year. The causes for
this state of affairs are not far to
seek. The loose management
which prevailed until the entire
control of finances was placed in
the treasurer's hands was respons
ible for old debts to the amount of
$1,f>50 which the present adminis
tration has had to meet. .An en
tirely new field with enlarged seat
ing capacity had to be provided for
this year's game at the cost of
$1,100 to each university. The
coach cost $1,150. The rain re
duced receipts fully $8,000 on
Thanksgiving. Despite these ad
verse conditions the management
is fully $800 ahead on the present
season.
THE OUTLOOK.
With ordinary sources of revenue,
as has been said, the student body
will be from seven to eight hun
dred dollars in debt. If the stu
dent body and the various musical
and dramatic organizations are
willing to second the efforts of the
administration, there is no reason
why this debt should not be wiped
out. Only one third of the student
body assessments have yet been
collected. With any sort of co-op
eration, the treasurer should be able
to raise $200 from this source of
revenue alone. $200 more may be
raised from lecturers from abroad.
The assistance of the musical tal
ent ought to be good for the re
mainder. The executive com
mittee and treasurer, however, are
powerless without a strong public
sentiment back of them.
