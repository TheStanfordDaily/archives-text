From all accounts, Berkeley is
putting forth unusual efforts this
year to obtain a championship
baseball team. Class games are
already being arranged, :ill avail

able material is being brought out,
and there is every prospect of an
outburst of baseball enthusiasm
among the students at the State
University.
This is one branch of sport in
which Stanford has, in the past,
proved herself superior to her rival,
but it has not been by indifference;
energy has been demanded and has
been freely expended. With the
loss of a majority of our "reliables,"
it behooves us to exercise unusual
activity this year, not only in call
ing out every possible candidate,
but in giving the men plenty of
practice when once they are out.
A schedule of inter-class games
should be arranged to take place as
soon as practicable, and the man
agement, in planning inter-col
legiate matches, should arrange
to have the entire series completed
by the middle of April. If this is
not done there will be the same
complaint heard that has been
heard in past seasons, viz., that the
games interfere with the studies of
those who participate, as well as of
those who are merely spectators.
Let our baseball men get together
immediately and go in to win the
inter-collegiate championship once
more; let the students give the play
ers hearty, energetic support, and let
this not be the year that the glori
ous cardinal sinks on the diamond
for the first time before the blue
and gold.
