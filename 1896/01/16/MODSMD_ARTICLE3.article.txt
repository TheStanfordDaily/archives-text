# Music by Stanford. Talent.

### 
A new march has lately been
composed by Kaufman, '97, dedi
cated to the Kappa Alpha frater
nity. The music of this new work
is said to excel anything yet com
posed by the author. The .John
Church Co. are publishing the
march, and the fact that it will ap
pear in form for bands, orchestras,
mandolin and banjo clubs, as well
as for the piano, is in itself evi
dence of its high merit.
Mr. Kaufman's "Stanford Uni
versity March" is now being played
by Scheel's Symphony Band at
Hammerstein's Theatre, New York,
one of the greatest play-houses in
the United States. The '''9G
INI arch" is being played at the Co
lumbia Theatre, San Francisco, to
gether with the "Freshman Two
step," which will be on the campus
soon. The "Sophomore March,"
lately written by Mr. Kaufman,
completes the list for all the classes.
