# The
						Economics of Education

Mr. P. \V. Search,ex-superintend
ent of schools in Los Angeles, de
livered a lecture in the chapel last
evening on "The economics of edu
cation." The following is a brief
abstract of his discourse:
There is a lack of appreciation
in this country of the true values
of education. Its value even from
a pecuniary standpoint is under
rated. For, if Herbert Spencer is
right in that education makes pos
sible a greater generation of power,
it must follow that with education a
man is better equipped for his bus
iness than without it.
In this country, too, the idea of
"protection" permeates everything.
We want to protect men in the pur
suit of their business —to surround
them with a, high wall. Rut men
who are skilled —and skill comes
from education —need no protection.
When we have schools to train
men in the different trades we
shall no longer have to go abroad
for the better class of our goods.
It is true that with the coining of
the skilled man there is a crowding
to the wall of those who do not re
adjust themselves. The solution of
this problem is better education
for the unskilled.
The representative educated man
is the college graduate. Of these
there have been less than two hun
dred thousand in our country up
to the present time, about one to
every five hundred of population.
It is interesting to note what a
large proportion of the men who
have held high positions have been
college graduates.
Of our 24 presidents, 17 have
been college graduates; of 24 vice
presidents, 15 have been college
graduates; and this proportion holds
good of the cabinet officers; the
chances, on the whole, being about
31(1 to 1, in favor of the college
graduate as against those who have
not a college education —in favor
of the educated against the uned
ucated. In our cyclopedias of bi
ography, which may he taken as
registering the names of those who
have been most successful in life,
we find the same large odds in fa
vor of the college graduate.
Another value of education not
fully appreciated is its power to
make work easier and more efficient.
A review of the daily life of our
hard workers, like President Har
per for example, who is an inces
sant worker, would show the im
mense gain in efficiency of the abil
ity to avoid and bridge over the
difficulties of life; while the sav
ing in energy is amply shown in
the length of the lives of our great
thinkers and workers. On this
last point statistics show educated
men, almost without exception, to
be blessed with a long life, good ex
amples of longevity being Mr.
Gladstone and Edward Everett
Hale, both very conspicuous in the
affairs of the world.
Summing up, education is desir
able because it gives success in bus
iness, conduces to longevity, and
makes possible that culture and
refinement and all-round success
which we see exempli tied in the lives
of our great men, past and present.
