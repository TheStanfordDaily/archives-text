The statement that only a third
of the student body assessments
have been paid is enough to take
away the breath of any one who
stops to consider such a condition
of affairs. Stanford students rather
pride themselves on their loyalty
and devotion to their alma mater.
Their self-congratulation is rather
ridiculous, however, in face of the
astonishing fact that only one in
every three students has had the
enterprise and public spirit to pay
to the student body what everyone
knows is necessary if there is to be
a vigorous and efficient administra
tion of student affairs. Probably
the great majority of the delin
quents are so through neglect; but
neglect of the kind that forgets to
pay its dues is inexcusable. There
should not be a single student in
this University in debt to the stu
dent body. All are equally bound
to pay the moderate sum required.
Education at Stanford costs little,
and it is surely within the power
of every one to contribute to the
funds that are so necessary if we
would attain the position in ath
letics and other fields desired by all
of us.
