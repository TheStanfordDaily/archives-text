The dance which it was proposed
to hold in the gymnasium next Fri
day night for the benefit of the
baseball fund will not be given.
That much was decided this week
by the Faculty Committee in
charge of the gymnasium, when
they refused to allow the baseball
management the use of the build
ing for that purpose, giving as their
reason the tendency of such events
to distract the attention of the stu
dents from their work. It will be
difficult for many to see just how a
small informal party given on a
Friday night will distract very
much from a person's studying, es
pecially in view of the fact that
that is a night of general relaxa
tion from study on the part of
nearly every student, and that
there are numerous other social at
tractions taking place in various
quarters at the same time, to which
those will go who are now pre
vented from going to the dance.
The action of the committee may
be taken to mean that no more
dances will hereafter be allowed in

the gymnasium except the annual
affairs given by each of the different
classes.
It is certain that this decision
will impose additional problems
upon such student organizations as
are dependent upon such affairs for
much financial support. There is
no question that these social events
are an unfailing source of revenue
and assistance to worthy causes.
Last year a dance of this nature
was given by the Student Guild,
netting over one hundred and fifty
dollars for carrying on their noble
work, and everybody had hoped
that the affair would be repeated
this year.
As to what those in charge of
baseball will now do, remains to be
seen. There is no help to be
counted on from the treasury, and
the management finds itself in a
position worse by far than it has
ever occupied before. The one
source of aid seems to be effectually
closed to them, and what will turn
up as a possible means of release
from the dilemma is not easy to
imagine. Private subscriptions,
always the last resort of a crippled
cause, will almost certainly prove
inadequate, and the prosperity of
our baseball interests this year
must necessarily depend upon some
yet to be determined scheme for
support.
