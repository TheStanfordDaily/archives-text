# The 						Trophy Cup.
## 
### 
The Women's Tennis Club has
just purchased a trophy cup, the
funds for which were raised partly
by entrance fee of the tournament
a ye;ir ago and partly by sub
scriptions of interested friends.
The cup is to be played for each
semester, and is to be kept in the pos
session of the winning student
until it shall be taken from her by
the winner of the next tournament.
