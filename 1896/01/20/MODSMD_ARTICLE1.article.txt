# THIRD PRELIMINARY DEBATE.
## Judges Announce the Names of the Three Speakers. 
### 
The last of the preliminaries of
the inter-collegiate debate was held
in the chapel Saturday night. The
subject of debate was "Resolved,
That the protective tariff policy of
the United States has been detri
mental to the best interests of
American agriculture.' 1 Mr. 15. M.
Palmer acted as chairman of the
evening ami introduced the speak
ers.
Frank V. Keesling, first for the
affirmative, argued that protection
in conjunction with other causes
liiis produced the present depression
and fall in prices. Our farm ex
ports at present are seventy-live
per cent, of entire export; this is
ten percent, of entire agricutural
production. Our tariff system has
placed the American farmer at the
mercy of the foreign markets.
Furthermore, prices are being con
tinually lowered by new fields
opened in other countries. Protec
tion has prejudiced the foreign
buyer, giving our farmer the poor
est of a poor market. Manufac
tured goods are declining less than
r i w materia 1.
.J. M. Ross, speaking for the neg
ative, said, in substance: Agricult
ure in America has attained its
highest state under protection. The
fall in prices of farm products can
not be attributed to the tariff sys
tem. A general depression, over
production, as shown in the raising
of wheat, and charges of transpor
tation, ail tend to lower prices. It
has been said that the protective
svstem has covered our farms with
mortgages. These reports can not
be verified. Eighty-seven percent,
of tlie mortgaged land lies in six
states, and this is mostly on town
and city lots. The closing of for
eign markets limits the sale of farm
products in other countries and
lowers the price. The growth of
our cities has much to do with the
status of our farms. The real ef
fects of the protective tariff system
have been to uphold the prices of
farm products.
11. C. Smith, for the affirmative,
speaking of the origin of our pro
tective tariff system, showed how it
was tirst employed to aid the in
fant industries of our country.
Agriculture has never received such
aid from the government. Since
the introduction of the system he
has been enjoying high prices for
what he buys and receiving low
prices for what he sells. The
farmer more than the munufaeturer
must compete against the world.
Protection prejudices our foreign
commerce and thus the farmer is
made to suffer. Furthermore, the
protective system must be con
stantly revised, causing a general
confusion and marked depression
in the markets.
R. 11. Wardall, for the negative,
reviewed the history of the protec
tive system. Industries have been
developed by protection and a
home market created. Again, on
account of the failure of crops
throughout Europe in INB7, there
was great incentive in the United
States to go into farming. This
caused an over-production which in
its turn caused a depression in
prices. Again the protective tariff

I system has brought about great
j progress in all manufacturing and
commercial lines, all of which
! must be a help to the farmer.
After the closing remarks of Mr.
! Keesling the judges retired. The
board of judges, consisting of Pro
fessors 0. C. Elliott, E. A. Ross,
and A. I>. Show, appointed to de
cide upon three debaters, chose
i 11. D. Sheldon, J. M. Ross, and
| A. M. Cathcart, with \V. P. 1 larring
! ton as substitute.
