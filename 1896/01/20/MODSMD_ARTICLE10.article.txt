The amount of enthusiasm that
is being shown by Berkeley this
year in all lines of college work is
truly remarkable. Not only in
athletics but in a literary way is
this indication prominent, and it is
very likely that Stanford is des
tined to rub u|» against an opposi
tion this semester that will tax to
the utmost the abilities of her rep
resentatives to meet.
As candidates for the honor of
representing their college in the de
hate for the Carnot. medal, Berke
ley has twelve active and deter
mined aspirants in the field, and
this number contrasts very forcibly
with the paltry three of which
our University boasts. As three
speakers are to be chosen from each

university in this debate, the Stan
ford candidates are all practically
sure of their places. It is indeed
fortunate that they are all students
in whose ability we have the great
est faith, for with the element of
competition removed, there is lack
ing that impetus that aids in bring
ing about victory.
At last we are to have our de
partment of music. It is true that
the new institution is not to be di
rectly supported by the University,
but the arrangements as made
bring the fees, except for individual
instruction, down to the juice of an
ordinary laboratory course. Ordi
narily a great obstacle in the culti
vation of the voice is the high price
charged by competent teachers.
The fees in these courses will be
within the reach of almost any one.
We have long needed just such a
spur as this to our musical activi
ties. The Glee Club, our only or
ganization for the production of vo
cal music, has never been much of
a success, and, with the exception
of "Pinafore," no other attempt at
organized singing has ever been
made. Lectures, public debates,
general entertainments, have passed
off from the lirst without any mu
sic whatsoever, except that fur
nished by outsiders. A well-trained
chorus could add immensely to the
pleasure of these events.
Let no false modesty prevent
students from coining forward to
register for this chorus work. The
instructor is not expecting to find
phenomenal voices; any one who
can carry a tune and who has a
voice without impediment is qual
ified for the course.
