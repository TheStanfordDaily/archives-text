# The
						Junior Annual.
## 
### 
Work on the '97 Annual is now
; well under way. Yesterday Pro
j lessors Lathrop, Newcomer, and
Hardy, who acted as judges, an
nounced Mr. D. Coolidge as the
winner of the prize offered for the
best short story. The story is en
titled "Thrown Among Barbarians,''
and it reflects an interesting phase
lof life at Stanford. The prize for
the best poem was awarded to Mr.
I Irving E. Outcast for his poem "A
Token." It is written in blank
verse which exhibits considerable
mastery of that difficult form, and
an exact observation of nature,
with the ability to happily char
acterize some of her more subtle
moods.
A feature will be made of both
the art and the literary depart
ments. Regarding illustrations,
there will be almost forty full-page
I drawings, in addition to numerous
| headings and tail-pieces. Among
I those already engaged upon the il
lustration ot the Annual are R. K.
Culver, Miss 11. M. Morton, Merle
| Johnson, Miss Hyde, Roy 1). Ely,
Miss Mitchell, Henry McCartney,
Miss Hoi ley, 11. C." Allen. Miss
j Lesley, and Miss Louise Cul
j ver.
Among the literary features, in
addition to the prize story and
| poem, will be a story by Miss Mary
L. Meyriek. The theme is one of
local interest,and will be illustrated
by Miss Culver. Mr. E. M. Huline
has written a memorial poem in
memory of Leland Stanford .1 unior,
in the difficult, but beautiful, Ten
nysonian stanza. In the poem Mr.
! 11 n 1 Die strikes a new note, and
it is certainly the most ambit
! ions work that he has yet at
tempted. It will receive two full
page illustrations by Mr. Culver,
l who will a Iso decorate an >ther poem
by the same writer. Miss Sarah
i Comstock will also be represented
I>v two poems, both of which will
be illustrated by Miss Morton. Mr.
Charles K. Field contributes a
'poem that will receive two full-page
I illustrations. "A Coquette" is the
title of a poem by Miss Winifred
Harper that is to be illustrated by
j Merle Johnson. It is of the nature
of what is known as rrrs <1c st>cietc,
1 for the want of a better phrase. It
! is neither too slight nor too heavy,
and contains the proper admixture
of daintiness, tenderness, and hu
mor that makes for the success of
metrical wares in this scarce suf
ficiently appreciated <ievrc.
Several members of the faculty
will be represented by photographs
and biographies. The financial
outlook is a bright one, and all in
dications point to a degree of suc
cess that will reflect credit upon the
Pniversity, as well as the Class of
'97.
