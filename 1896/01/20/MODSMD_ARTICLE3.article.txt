# New Course in Music.
## 
### 
Editor of Daily Palo Ai-to:
Sir: —Last semester the attempt
was made by several persons inter
ested in music to provide an op
portunity for obtaining musical in
struction of a high quality at the
Pniversity. This attempt did not
succeed, but some of us resolved to
carry it through this semester if
possible. The University author
ities kindly granted us the use of
the rooms we might need, and of
fered to allow credit towards the
degree for such study, under a
teacher selected by us and approved
by the Pniversity, as deserved a
place in the University course.
We feel we have a right to con
gratulate ourselves and the Pniver
sity on the fact that we made ar
rangements with Mr. 11. R. Pas
more of San Francisco for the work.
Mr. Pasmore studied at the Leipsic
Conservatory, where at the re
quest of Professor Jadassohn he
translated .Jadassohn's well-known
text-book of harmony. Mr. Pas
more is a composer of merit, being
the author in particular of a num
ber of beautiful songs. He is now
a teacher of vocal music, which he
studied under Shakespeare of the
London Conservatory. Many of
us will remember with pleasure his
lecture on the art of singing last
semester. The union of wide and
thorough musical knowledge with
special knowledge of the voice and
of the art of singing fit Mr. Pasmore
peculiarly for the place we hope he
will fill here as instructor in music
and as a helpful guide in the mu
sical activities of the University.
Mr. Pasmore will give lessons in
harmony and lessons in singing
and the use of the voice—the latter
in private, in small classes and in
"special" classes, and will lead a
chorus if a sufficient number of
persons, say sixty, join it.
Mr. Pasmore will spend all day
Wednesday of each week at the
University.
The scheme of the courses is as
follows:
Harmony.—A thorough course
in the elements of harmony. This
course will meet one hour a week,
will require about five hours of
preparation and practice a week,
will be recognized by the University
as a two-hour course, and will be
known as Music 1. The class will
meet in sections of not more than
eight, preferably of six, at hours to
be determined by the convenience
of the students, and the fee, fifteen
dollars a semester, is payable to the
Registrar in advance.
The Chorus.-—A mixed chorus
will be formed if the number desir
ous of joining it is sufficient. No
technical knowledge of music is
requisite for membership, and
everybody who can manage to
carry a tune is advised to have his
voice tried. Membership in such a
chorus affords a rare opportunity
for becoming acquainted with the
works of great masters, and pro
vides an element sadly lacking in
our University life. The fee, from
one to five dollars a semester, ac
cording to the numbers, will be paid
in advance to a treasurer elected by
the members of the chorus.
Voice Culture and Singing.
The instruction in singing is to )*•
arranged for between Mr. Pasmore

and the individual students, and
the fees are to be paid to him.
Special Class Lessons. —Ten pu
pils will form a class and will he
taught collectively. The class will
go through a regular course of vo
calization and tone work, and in
short will he taught ;is one voice,
while as much individual criticism
;ts possible will be given. Fee, ten
dollars a semester.
Conservatory Classes.—Two or
three students will lie taught to
gether in an hour, obtaining thus
the advantages both of individual
criticism and of observing the work
of others. Fee: each of two in an
hour, thirty-seven dollars and a
half a semester; each of three,
twenty-live dollars a semester.
Private Lessons.- Two dollars
and a half fora half-hour lesson,
or thirth-seven dollars and fifty
cents a semester.
Mr. Pasmore will be at the Uni
versity to make arrangements for
the work on Wednesday next, Jan
uary '2'2, from 10 to 12:80 in the
Roble parlors, and from 1:00 to
"r.OO in the chapel. Persons inter
ested in any branch of the instruc
tion to be given are invited to con
fer with him at any time during
these hours. At 7 :.'>() Wednesday
evening the chorus will meet in the
chapel for preliminary organiza
tion. At 4:00 Mr. Pasmore will be
glad to have a,< many as find it
convenient to meet him in the
chapel fora general conference
with regard to the plans here out
lined.
As the total number of members
of the University actively inter
ested in the matter will probably
not lie sufficient to support this
movement as well as we could wish,
the privileges here offered will be
extended to persons not registered
iu the University. An invitation
is cordially given to all people of
musical tastes living within reach
of the University to take advan
tage of the opportunity thus given.
