At the last meeting of the Seniors
Julius Frankenheimer, manager of
'ao's Annual, reported on the
linances of the class publication
and formally turned over to the
class $200 â€”profits from the ven
ture. Of course Messrs. Franken
heimer and \\\ D. Briggs, editor-in
chief, were justly entitled to all
profits, so their action was one of
voluntary liberality. The class ac
cepted tilt; sum and donated it to
the ilildebrand Library Fund,
proving by this action an unusu
ally enterprising class spirit.
