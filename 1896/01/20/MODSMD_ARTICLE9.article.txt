The election of our three repre
sentative debaters by the judges
was eminently satisfactory. All
three of the men chosen are repre
sentative Stanford students, and
all have good records as skillful de
baters. The choice made could
not be improved upon; and our
standard bearers enter the lists
feeling that they have the good will
and hearty support of every Stan
ford student, each of whom feels
the utmost confidence in the ability
of our debaters to win back our de
parted prestige.
