Lately the botanical laboratory
has been closed against those who
formerly ate their lunches there.
During this disagreeable weather
the students who bring lunches
with them to the University can
hardly be expected to sit outside
while eating them. If lunch-taking
can not be allowed in this building,
a suitable place should be desig
nated so that there can be no fur
ther misunderstanding.
