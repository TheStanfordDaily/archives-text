Certain students in Encina Hall
are becoming entirely too reckless
in their acts of vandalism. He
sides the theivery Fin the rooms,
which may or'may not have been
done by the students, and the
rough treatment of periodicals on
the reference tables, there has been
a great amount of general lawless
ness in the way of smashing furni
ture and damaging property. Sun
day night two chairs and a table on
the fourth floor were broken; a few
nights before some one destroyed
considerable furniture in the main
lobby; and something is lost or de
stroyed nearly every day.
The truth is that a certain un
desirable class of students is
stronger in the hall than ever be
fore. We refer to the men who
come to college with the idea that
university life is a round of free-for
all revelry, and that a student is a
privileged character who can con
duct himself as lie pleases without
let or hindrance.
We can well spare this class of
men, and, while the proper com
mittee will eventually overtake the
persons guilty of this vandalism,
they can yet do much harm while
they remain. Since each inmate
of the hall must help pay for the
broken furniture, the suppression
of such persons becomes a duty
every Encina resident owes to him
self as well as to his fellows.
