Those who have contributed to
wards a reading-room fund in
Encina are beginning to wonder
when there is to be any systematic
control of the papers and maga
zines. At present it seems to be
everybody's business, and conse
quently nobody's, whether the

reading-room is properly managed
or not. The monthly magazines
are put on the tables long after
they come out in the stores; and
after being mutilated at will by
unthinking readers, they myster
iously. disappear. The latest issues
of the weeklies are rarely on the
tables when they should be. At
this time of the month all that can
be found are copies ad libitum of a
religious paper, the dailies, and a
few copies of Puck and Judge.
This state of affairs should be
speedily remedied. It should be
made an object to those who have
charge of the reading-room to keep
it in order, and the only way to do
this is to offer some' remuneration
for the time and trouble. The
honor of holding the position lias
proven an insufficient incentive.
In case a new system of control is
adopted, steps should be taken to
lit out the room with proper facil
ities for preserving the papers.
Racks for the dailies are sadly
needed. There being no other
proper committee to take this mat
ter in hand, we suggest that the
hall committee do so. Any move
ment that they may take towards
bettering the management of the
room will be greatly appreciated
