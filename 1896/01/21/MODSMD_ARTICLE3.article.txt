# The 						Chess and Whist Club.

### 
Although there are a great many
students in the University who
play both chess and whist, the non
existence of such an organization
may he given as a cause for the lack
of interest in the two games.
During the years '90-"94 and '94
-'95 an organization was in exist
ence known us the Stanford Chess
Club, hut beyond the forming of
the club nothing was ever done; not
even once did (he players get to
gether for practice, ami the conse
quence was that the club was a de
cided failure. The same is true of
the history of whist in the Uni
versity. While a few interested
whist players were able to meet oc
casionally, yet it was realized that

the best players could not be
reached unless there was some cen
tral organization. Those interested
in either of the great games felt
that a separate organization of their
favorite game would be too weak,
and it was finally decided to com
bine the interests of the two games
under one head.
The object of the club is to find
some room or snite of rooms and to
furnish them in real club style.
Then whist and chess tournaments
can be carried on, and a decided
improvement may be expected in
the quality of the players.
Then, should the Berkeley club
approach us as they claim to have
formerly done, a different answer
and favorable result might be an
ticipated.
At Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
and Columbia such tournaments
are carried on annually, and there
is no reason why Stanford should
not defeat Berkeley in these games
as is done in many others.
