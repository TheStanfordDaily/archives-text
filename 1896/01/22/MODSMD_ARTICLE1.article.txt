# The 						Stability of Truth.
## 
### 
The regular Tuesday evening
lecture was delivered last evening
by 1 >r. Jordan on ' The stability of
truth." The substance of the lec
ture is reproduced in the following
outline:
Within the hist three years sci
ence has received three notable as
saults: two from the hostile camp
of mediaeval metaphysics, the other
from science itself. "Belief" may
rest on the foundation unknown to
'"knowledge." We are in the hands
of the Fates, and the greater our ac
tivities the more evident become
the limiting conditions. Scienceas
a whole is no longer individual. Jt.
is the gathered wisdom of the race;
it is the flower of altruism of the
ages. We know only by our own
experience and the experience of
others, and we can find the mean
ing of phenomena only from our
reasoning bused upon these experi
ences. Thus the laws of nature are
not the products of science. They
are human glimpses of that which
is the "law before all time."
So we have the question, Is be
lief to be tested by science? or is
science useful only where belief is
indifferent to the subject? If be
lief is subordinate to the test of sci
ence, then it is simply an annex to
science, and the authority of the
latter is supreme. It", however,
truth comes to us from sources out
side of human experience, it must
come in some pure form, free from
human errors.
The Martinis of Salisbury con
tended that the central thought of
modern science is evolution. His
advice to the scientific association
to which he spoke may be stated in
the words of Thackeray: "We
should think small beer of our
selves, and puss around the bottle."
Mr. Balfour in his "Method of
Belief' has shown that the method
of science can not give absolute
t ruth. 1 ts method is ' of the
earth" and fallible. Science can
give no ground solid enough to
bear the weight of belief.
The commonest things become
unknown or impossible when
viewed in the critical light of
philosophy. Balfour says the
term, "the sun gives light," loses
all \\> meaning and possibility
when taken out of the category of
human experience and discussed in
terms of philosophy. So a man
may be forced to doubt the exist
ence of himself or any object. All
that we know even of ourselves is
that which is external to ourselves.
Our mind is "the stuff that dreams
are made of" ; and our bodies
what are they? But the conclus
ions of science represent human ex
perience. Each fact of law must
be expressed in terms of human
experience, if expressed at all. To
such words the term reality applies,
and beyond that we have never
gone.
The measure of man is the basis
of human knowledge, and what
ever can not he brought to this
measure is no part of knowledge.
The primal motive of science is
to regulate the conduct of life
"Men and nations rcapas they have
sown."
Each living being is a link in a
continuous chain of life. Into this
chain of life so far as we know

Death lias never entered; because
only in life has the ancestor the
power of casting off the germ-cells
by which life is continued. Each
link is tested as to its fitness; those
creatures unadapted to their en
vironments are destroyed; and this
environment is the objective I'ni
verse. Nature has no pardon for
ignorance or illusions. This adapta
tion is the essence of obedience.
Death ends the chain of which
the creature is a link, and the life
of the world is continued by those
whose choice has not been fatal.
To the wise and obedient the most
complex life brings no special
strain or discomfort. The freedom
of self-realization involves the free
dom of self-perdition. There is no
alleviation for the woes of life,
''save the absolute veracity of ac
tion: the resolute facing of the
world a> it is."
The truths of science are truths
in part only. Knowledge that can
only accumulate without being
woven into conduct has never been
a boon to its possessor. With the
reduction of the accuracy of recog
nition of reality, the person ceases
to hold his.place as a man among
men. The sober mind is necessary
to secure life. The perverse, the
insane, and the stupid live through
the tolerance of others. As Dr.
Powers has said: "There is in civil
ization not a single vice that race
progress can spare." The fool lives
in society only by the sufferance of
the sane; the weak by the altruism
of the strong. What we call social
virtues are the elements of race sta
bility.
1 low do we know that an im
pression is true? Because we can
trust our lives to it. If it were an
illusion it would kill, because action
based on illusion leads to death.
The security of human life in its
relations to environment is a suf
ficient answer to the "philosophic
doubt" of Berkeley and Balfour as
to the existence of external matter.
With the power of "movement"
and the "knowledge of good or
evil," man has no choice but to ac
cept the conditions. We may play
at philosophy but we must guide
our lives by science.
