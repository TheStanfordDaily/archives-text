Much inconvenience and delay
could be prevented if those desir
ing certain text-books would leave
their orders at the Co-Op. in time
for them to be ordered and re
ceived before they are needed in
class work. The distance between
us and the publishing houses of
the Last, and the small demand in
the West for the books used
here, make it necessary for all books
of this kind to be sent for in ad
vance. Unless the number of
persons needing copies of a par
ticular work is definitely known,
either too few or too many must be
bought by the Co-Op. In one case
those who go last to the store must
do without until the arrival of
another lot. In the other the
Co-Op. must keep dead stock on its
shelves, to the detriment of all its
patrons.
