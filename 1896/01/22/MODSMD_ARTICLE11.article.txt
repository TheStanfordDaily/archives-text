The action of the Women's Ten
nis Club in purchasing a trophy
cup to be contested for each semester
by members of theclub, is certainly
a very enterprising one and shows
that the organization is in a most
healthy and active condition.
Interest in tennis has been steadily
increasing among the women of the
I'niversity for sometime, and it is
gratifying to note that this enthu
siasm has at last taken some tan
gible form. Hereafter there will be
not only pleasure but honor and
reward in store for the winners of
these tournaments.
In this connection it will perhaps
not be amiss to state that the Men's
Tennis Association might wisely
follow the example set for them by
their younger sister organization.

Although members of this club have |
a most powerful incentive in that I
j the winner represents Stanford in;
1 the annual inter-collegiate contests !
| with Berkeley, yet it cannot be out ,
Of place to increase this impetus, j
| To contest for such a cup would j
produce an added interest in these|
j tournaments and result in placing j
I the standard of the game on a
higher level than it has ever oc
cupied before.
