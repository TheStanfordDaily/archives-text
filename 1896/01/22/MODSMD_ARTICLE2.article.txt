Miss Ray Frank of Oakland de
livered the I'niversity sermon Sun
day. The subject of her discourse
was"The moral law in nature,''
and ;i brief abstract of her remarks
follows:
The speaker began by giving an
account of a trip to the Far North,
the object of the recital being to
show how the one central law of
the universe manifests itself to the
seeing. She had been detailed to
do ;i certain work, a part of which
was to interview an Indian chief.
While seeking the chief on the
Indian Reservation, she came upon
a lonely cabin 011 the corner of
which she saw tacked up a Scroll of
the Law. indicating that he was a
Jew. It was a holiday, and when
she chided him for not going to the
settlement to celebrate it, he re
plied thai the day they were to
celebrate was that in honor of the
sounding of the trumpets at Jeri
cho and that he had but to step
outside of his door and hear in the
voices of nature the notes of the

trumpet. To him the flowing!
river, the trees, the stones, the very
sod spoke law and beauty and.
order. City folks, he thought, do i
not see these things.
There is always a tendency to i
look upon the outside of things.;
The speaker noticed this in her
self as she came down by the bay.
On one side of the train was aj
weary stretch of water, on the other
side all was green and beautiful, j
W T hy was m1 I the beauty on one j
side and all the barrenness on the
other? And the eternal "click
click" of the car-wheels, why
should that be? The answer is,
because they are all parts of one
grand whole. We should not
separate the click of the car-weeels
from the rails, the barren from the
beautiful, but should recognize
them as being parts of one whole,
tinder one law, directed by one
We are liable, too, not to con
sider that the same law which acts j
upon the tree acts upon us. We
think, as we go our way, that we
are free moral agents and that we
will do as we like. We forget that
our freedom is merely to obey or
not to obey, and that we have no
freedom from pain, which always
and inevitably follows disobedience.
Obey. Obey. This is nature's
first, command. But how shall we
know this law, a law so far be
yond mortal ken ? There is 110
answer. We can only keep learn
ing 1 >3' experience, and constantly
apply the knowledge we have.
Just as a blind person after collid
ing with a few things learns to put
out his hand and in this way saves
himself from further injury.
One truth which we have learned
concerning this universal law is
that man is doing his best only
when he is working for the many.
Man has no right to sit
still; he must concern himself
with others. The way in which
persons come to grief who are self
ish and intent 011 gain, was illus
trated by a story from Talmud
which the speaker heard at the
World's Parliament of Keligions.
A woman who had been sent into
hell wailed so loudly that the Lord
had compassion on her and sent an
angel to ask her will. She said she
had repented of her sins, and asked
to be removed from the flumes, no
matter how small a distance, if she
was but moved. The angel returned
to the Lord, who, on hearing the
poor woman's request, instructed
the messenger to take a carrot, and
carrying it to hell, have the poor
sinner take hold of it. This he
did. W hen the woman took hold,
she immediately began to rise, but
as she rose she felt a weight at her
feet which grew constantly heavier,
i All the people in hell were hang
ing from her feet, one from another,
and when the weight became un
bearable the poor woman called
out in the frenzy of her fear, " I be
carrot is mine!" In an instant the
stem which the angel held parted
from the carrot, and the woman
and all who were below her fell
back into hell. What is thine is
thine and what is mine is mine, is
the right view to take.
