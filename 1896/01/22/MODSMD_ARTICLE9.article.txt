Now that the Junior Class iiiis
chosen its officers, it is imperative
that preparations for the celebration
of Junior Day be made at once.
Hitherto we have been disposed to
crowd all amusements and social
functions into the last month of
the semester, leaving the intermedi
ate months dull and full of care.
Let the time from now until May
be divided between the debates and
class exercises, and nothing but
Commencement disturb the seren
ity of final examinations.
