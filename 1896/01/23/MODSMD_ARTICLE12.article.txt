I'hk bicycle ordinance, passed by
the Town Board of Palo Alto dur
ing the fall, requiring bicyclists to
carry lamps at night, stands a
chance of being repealed. The or
dinance lias been found inconveni
ent, not only by bicyclists in Palo
Alto, but by those living on the
campus, and on this ground the
Merchants' Protective League of the
town is endeavoring to have it re
scinded. It is to be hoped they
will meet with success.
