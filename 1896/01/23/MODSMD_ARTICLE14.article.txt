The •University is dependent
upon students fora lire depnrtnient.
The recent lire in the chemistry
laboratory proves how willing in
dividuals are to respond to such a
call. Nevertheless, the work done
on that occasion was largely hin
dered by a lack of some method of
indicating the location of the lire.

The first comers were obliged to go
lo the engine-house to obtain such
information, and in this way the
tirst few minutes., so important in
such :m emergency, were wasted.
A simple system of signals might

house —for example, one for the

Any similar plan generally known,
and used in case of tire, might he

It is not often that Stanford stu
dents need reminders in mat
ters of courtesy and tact. Hut
among the most considerate and
j well-behaved there is always •some
one inclined to be a trifle regard
less of the rights of others—a trifle
thoughtless of their comfort. There
j are a few students who seem to re
j gard the reading-room of the
library as a rendezvous and con
versation-room rather than a place
|of study. We have heard several
j complaints lately about the talk
ing that frequently goes on at the
| tables in the reading-room. I'rob
| ably those who are guilty of the of
i fence do not mean to be rude, but
; they should endeavor to remember
j that even whispering, when long
continued, is distracting and ex
j asperating to those who are trying
jto study. There are always enough
' unavo dahle disturbances in a large
reading-room without the addition
jof unnecessary ones. We trust
| that whatever ground there has
been for complaint will disappear.
Talking and laughing at the study
tables ought to be strictly avoided.
