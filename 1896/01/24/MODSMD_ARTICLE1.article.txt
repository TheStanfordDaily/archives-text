# The
						Choral Society.

The Chorus met Wednesday
evening in the chapel, and while
the attendance was small, interest
and enthusiasm were not lacking.
Prof. D. 11. Campbell was chosen
president, Prof. 11. B. Lathrop vice
president, CL. Ma gee secretary,
Miss Burck halter treasurer, and
Miss I'eck librarian. It is expected
by those in charge that the mem
bership will reach one hundred,
there being a considerable number
from Mountain View, Maytteld, and
Palo Alto who have signified their
intention to join, as well as a num
ber of the members of the faculty;
at present there is rather a lack of
women's voices.
Mr. Pasmore made a statement
as to the purposes and plan of the
organization. The work will take
one and one half hours a week, no
outside preparation being required.
All persons, whether particularly
acquainted with music or not, will
be accepted as members. The mu
sic will be the highest order of
choral music, and some <>112 the cho
ruses of the great masters will be
taken up at once. The fee for
membership will be not more than
two dollars and fifty cents, perhaps
not more than two dollars.
With the aid of loans from some
of the members of the society, a
complete library has been obtained
which once belonged to a musical
society in San Francisco. It was
appraised some time ago at $4,800,
but is new purchased for $'200. It
includes over one hundred copies of
the vocal scores of each of the
choral works of all the great mas
ters, and will be presented to the
University for the use of the mu
sical societies. The fee for the
course is not intended to cover the
cost of the library; it will be paid
for by popular subscription. Meet
ings will be held every Wednesday
evening.
