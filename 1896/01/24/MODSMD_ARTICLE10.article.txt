# Student Aid for the Armenians.

### 
Daily Palo Alto:
It is now ;i common place
of the daily news that while
the great powers play their
interesting games of political
diplomacy, the people of Armenia
are hourly subjected to unspeak
able atrocities. As a result of
Turkish and Kurdish outrages
their means of subsistence have
been cut oft', and they are menaced
with immediate famine. Indeed,
there is already in many districts
of Armenia a degree of destitution
little short of starvation.
Such conditions appeal very
strongly to the humanitarian feel
ings of the American people.
Almost spontaneously a great move
ment hits been organized to carry
relief to the Armenians. This
movement is wholly nonsectarian
and without reference to creed or
confession; it rests entirely on the
broad principle of human fellow
ship. Its character and prospects
are sufficiently guaranteed by the
fact that Clara Barton and the lied
Cross Society have taken it up.
Miss Barton has sailed for Turkey,
with the pledge of the American
people to furnish her half a million
dollars for relief work. The Turk
ish government is not likely to
stand in the way of this mission.
The students of their own motion
have taken steps to give our Uni
versity community a share in this
commendable work. The cause ap
peals to us all alike, and I aln sure
the committee will meet with ;i
hearty response. The following
persons have been appointed as
committee to receive subscriptions
to the relief fund: Misses Bishop.
Haven, and Markham; Messrs.
1). L. Arnold, 11. 11. Brown, (iuy
Cochran, P. K. Davidson, 11. Har
i wood, B. M. Palmer, \Y. E. Nichols,
A. B. Siiow. A subscription list
can also be found at the Registrar's
office. Very truly,
i Arlky B. Show.
