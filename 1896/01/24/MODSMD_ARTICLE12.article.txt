Thk recent class elections hut j
emphasize the unwillingness of the
average student to accept minor |
class offices. The office of class j
president never goes hogging, hut it !
is no uncommon thing to sec some
half dozen offices declined before a
person can he found who hasenough
class spirit to remain on the ticket.
Some of the persons may have
reasons for so declining, hut the
majority, we feel certain, have no
excuse other than indifference.
Nevertheless,class organizations can '
not he continued nor class enter
tainments carried on unless in
dividuals are willing to accept these j
positions.
