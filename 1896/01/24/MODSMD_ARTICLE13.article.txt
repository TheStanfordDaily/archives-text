In another column will b& found
an outline of a most meritorious
work for the relief of the distressed
Armenians and an appeal for aid
from the students. From the daily
reports which have appeared
in all newspapers.for months past
everyone knows the terrible cruelties
this nation has suffered at Turkish
hands. Added to the brutality of
the soldiery the Armenians are now
suffering from the ravages of fam
ine, and a great movement has been
started in the United States to as
sist by subscriptions in tiding
over this period of destitution.
The movement has taken root
among college students and has
found a place at Stanford. A
merely nominal donation from
each individua 1 means a respectable
amount in the aggregate, and it is
to be hoped that the work will be
carried on hurriedly, the need be
ing urgent.
