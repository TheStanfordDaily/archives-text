There seems to be a marked
tendency for the interest in Sunday
sermons to drop off. This is a re
gretable fact. Notwithstanding
that it is quite difficult to secure
eminent thinkers and talented
speakers from outside points to
take charge of these meetings, we
have been favored in the past by
numerous men whom it was a
privilege as well as a pleasure to
hear. Hut it is evident that any
one who comes here to talk to
empty seats can be secured
fora second visit only with dif
ficulty. From this standpoint,

then, it is to be regretted that tiie
attendance at the chapel should he
j growing smaller and smaller as the
I weeks pass by.
! Hut there is another point of
view. The student who neglects to
I attend services at the beginning of
I a semester, will in all probability
continue to do so. It is not our
i business to argue with anyone as
I to whether attendance at the weekly
sermon is a gain or is not a gain;
j but we believe that those who have
once made a practice of attending
I must be convinced that he who
j stays away suffers a distinct loss.
I On Sunday next we shall have a
I gentleman with us who, it is fair to
suppose, will say a good deal worth
hearing. The Rev. Dr. Minton is
at the head of the Presbyterian
Seminary at San Anselmo and is a
man of reputation. It is to be hoped
that there will be a large at
tendance, not only because he
lisa talented man, but as an in
' dication that in the future the in
! terest in the Sunday services is go
! ing to increase.
