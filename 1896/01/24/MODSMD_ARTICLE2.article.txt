At the Economic Seminary Tues
day afternoon the tariff scheme
proposed by David Lubin of Sac
ramento was discussed. The ques
tion was, "(Jranting that protect ion
is to be the policy of the Cnited
States for some time to come, is it
just and expedient that an export
bounty be placed on agricultural
products. Zion,'94,and Harrington,
''.Mi, supported the affirmative; Ross,
'97, and Webster, '97, spoke in op
posit ion.
The affirmative spoke of the de
pressed condition of American agri
culture, the number of farm mort
gages, and the movement of the
rural population towards cities.
This, it was claimed, was caused
by the competition of staples from
Argentine, Russia, and India in
the markets of the world. These
countries now possess the labor
saving machinery of which the
American farmer but a few years
ago had a monopoly. With their
additional cheap labor they arc en
abled to sell their products in
Liverpool for less than the Amer
ican farmer with his higher stand
ard of living. If we do not send
staples abroad to pay for what we
buy, we shall have to send silver
and gold, which will result in finan
cial ruin.
The American farmer, who com

poses the largest part of our popu
lation and upon whom the nation
must depend for its sustenance,can
not turn from his present occupa
tion. It is therefore the duty of
the government to assist him as it
has the manufacturer; the farmer
can not he assisted hy the tariff, so
he must be protected hy a bounty.
In reply, the negative insisted
that the bounty is class legislation
The American farmer is not in the
condition that he is painted.
Wheat ond cotton are exceptional
staples. Prices have fallen because
more is produced than is needed.
The system can be remedied only
by lessening production or by di
versification. The bounty would
give only temporary relief; would
produce an artificial state. The
farmer would become dependent,
and the incentive toward produc
tion would be lessened. If a bounty
is given, the price of agricultural
products will fall to the amount of
the bounty; the price to the farmer
will then lie the same :is before the
bountv was added.
