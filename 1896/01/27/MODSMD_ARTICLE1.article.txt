# THE 						WORLD WITHIN.
## An Interesting- Discourse by a Talented Divine. 
### 
Rev. H. C. Minton of San Angel
mo discoursed yesterday on "The
world wiihin." lie chose for his
text Ecclesiastes iii,2: ''Also he hath
set ihe world in their heart"; and
spoke substantially as follows:
The meaning of these words is
certainly not very plain, though
the drift of the chapter is more ob
vious. The ancient author of the
words contemplated God in his
character of creator. God was the
originator of man. He made both
the world of matter and the world
of mind. He not only set up the
machinery about us, but he set up
the machinery of the human heart.
God him created the soul and set
up a world in that soul. This
world is not what men call the mi
crocosm, referring to themselves as
epitomes of the Universe, nor the
macrocosm, the universe itself; but
is a divinely created world â€”a
world of ideas and purposes, a world
of conceptions and ideals. It is a
mysterious world, with its pulsing
of life, its motions and commotions,
its actions and reactions. Therein
are all the splendors and grandeurs
of human thought, the matchless
majesties of human character. The
vagaries of mermaids and hobgob
lins are not of the world of God,
but are mere sportings of the hu
man brain. They come unbidden,
are lawless and valueless, and we
are in no way bound to observe or
obey them.
There are laws in the world of
God, however, which wecan not dis
obey. The fool saith in his heart
that a curved line describes a
shorter distance than a straight
line, but this is false. The fool
saith that a part of an object is
greater than the whole, but this too
we know to be untrue. We call
these axioms, but all axioms do
not belong to the world of math
ematics. There are truths which
are a part of us, truths from which
we can not get away. The idea or
belief or truth that there is a God,
is so firmly rooted in us that there
must be something wrong with the
inner world of the man who says
there is no God. We may call
these truths intuitions; we may say
that they come from above or from
below: but they are still with us.
We can not get away from them.
Take, for example, the belief in
infinity. We know that every
mountain, every river, every coast,
has its limit, its end. Every ge
nius of human thought, be it Far
aday or Newton, Goethe or Shaks
pere, all have had their limit. And
yet we have the idea of infinity.
The word is in every language, and
conveys something to all who hear
it. If there is nothing to corres
pond to this thought of infinity,
then God has set a falsehood in
the human soul. And so with the
belief in God. The conscious or
unconscious feeling of God is a part
of the human soul, and that sold
must indeed be dwarfed which does
not feel it. It was logical and rea
sonable, a sign of spiritual and in
tellectual advancement, the build
ing by the Greeks of an altar to the
I'nknown God.
The inner world of a man is his
character. It is the essence of the

man. Our thoughts within shape
our lives without. We live out our
own selves. All the achievements
of man in the physical world have
been the working out of thougts
which are a part of our inner
world.
Most of us have read or heard of
the St. Gothard Tunnel, and know
how the workmen, hundreds in
number, began in two bodies, one
on either side of the Alps, and how
the tunnels, when they were con
nected, varied but one eighth of an
inch from a straight line. This
great work, requiring more than
ten years for completion, and re
markable alike for the amount of
labor and the nicety of calculation
involved, was the execution of the
thought of a great French engineer,
M. Louis Favre.
And another instance : The
speaker met Dr. Murray at Oxford
some years ago and was shown
rooms where trained men were
reading all the old English litera
ture and setting down methodically
the different ways in which words
had been used up to that time.
Recently the world has received
the first volume of Dr. Murray's
great Historical Dictionary, and
the wideness and minuteness of re
search is a wonder to everybody.
But when the whole work is com
pleted it will stand for the work
ing out of a single thought of a
single man. Our three score and
ten years are not haphazard things.
We act out our thoughts of our
inner world. Every deed, good or
bad, springs from a thought. But
the thought must always precede
the action. For that reason the
millennium will not Come in society
until the millennium has come in
the human heart. In this we are
ever advancing. It is true the
world is blighted with sin and self
ishness, that we must all drink of
the bitter cup and bear our bur
dens alone. But we dream of a
world without sorrow or pain. It
is the soul's cry; it is the heart's
call; and unless there is something
somewhere to answer these long
ings, we nre a lie and the atheist's
belief is the best.
