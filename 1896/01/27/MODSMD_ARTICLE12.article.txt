Students should be very careful,
during and after each rain storm,
not to cross the cinder path or the
baseball diamond with their heavy
shoes. A moment's thoughtless
ness on the part of a single student
may cause hours of work on the
path, and the diamond could be
greatly damaged by making a
short cut across it to and from
the gymnasium.
As there is no money in the
treasury to expend in repairing the
track and field, the work devolves
on a few interested students. It is
but just for all others to cause them
as little labor as possible by keep
ing off both the track and diamond.
