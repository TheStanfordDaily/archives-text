The Class of aided in a large
degree by the three following classes,
created at Stanford what we term
the " Stanford spirit."' It is shown
in our attitude towards the Uni
versity and in a recognition of the
true purpose for which we are here.
We have prided ourselves upon
this spirit in the past, and have felt
confident that incoming classes
would recognize it and would act
in accordance with it. It is to be
deplored, therefore, that certain
members of the under class, by
their acts of depredation in Kncina,
have shown themselves entirely at
variance with the spirit which
must characterize our students.
Further depredations, therefore,
should be summarily dealt with.
Forbearance is no longer a virtue.
