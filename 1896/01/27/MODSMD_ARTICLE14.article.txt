At last, after most tiresome

suit —conies up for final hearing to
morrow. At present tilings look
very bright for us; even the papers
[which are l>y political affiliation|

acknowledge that we will probably!
win. Nevertheless the greater mini-1
her of us, to whom the outcome!
means so much, will await the 're-'
suit as anxiously as that noble wo
man to whom it means everything.
There is another side of the ques
tion, however. We may lose. The
law of the land is fearfully and
wonderfully arranged, and its re
suits are not to be predicted by the
t uninitiated. Most of the students
|in speaking of the suit think of
only one outcome —a glorious and

celebration. We hope fora favor
able result and we expect it. But
! there is this other side and it must
| not l>e lost sight of. It may be
that all the University's brilliant
prospects will receive a set-back,
i This is only a gloomy possibility.
We feel that the sacrifice in which i
the University was founded, the
j heroism with which it has been de

trial will not prove to have
been in vain. We expect a victory
that will make Stanford the rich
est and do much towards making
her the greatest University in the
! country.
