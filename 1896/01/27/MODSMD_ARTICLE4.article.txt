things—the long delay in court nor
the court routine which makes the i
delay of one case postpone another.
I am told that the sad death of
Judge Dillon's little grandchild,
although he was engaged on the
California irrigation cases, just pre
ceding mine on the court docket,
has also delayed the hearing in my
case.
"1 am waiting the outcome with
as much patience and little anxiety
as I can. Of course much depends
on it for me—everything in fact—
and I could not bear up under the
strain if I did not trust in a surely
just influence higher than any
power here engaged.
"It has seemed sometimes as if I
could not bear the anxiety and bur
den any longer," she continued.
"This litigation has constantly
been the uppermost subject in my
mind for nearly two years. And
while my lawyers feel very much
eneouraged over the success they
have had in the lower courts, I can
not but he anxious for the outcome
of every succeeding hearing, es
pecially here, where the decision is
to be final.
"I am not used to combating
against such odds. If my husband
were alive, I feel that the whole
trouble would melt away without
touching me, just as I have so often
seen him with ease banish great ob
stacles. 'I hen, too, the mainte
nance of the University, as the re
sult of this litigation, lias been a
great tax upon me, mentally and
tina ncially.
Mrs. Stanford says that, although
the court allowed her $10,000 a
month for her support, she has
lived on $300 a month and has
used $5.1,700 per month to help pay
the professors. She has also sold
bonds out of the $1,000,000 worth
which she held.
"The University only received
what I had been able to supply
from the proceeds of Vina and Palo
Alto farms and my personal funds.
I have been endeavoring for the last
two years to make these two large
properties bring in an income
larger than the outgo, and am |
much gratified to find that there
has been su< cess in a moderate way,
and am encouraged to believe that
I may do much better in years to
come. I ha ve learned through ex
perience that 'a dollar saved is a
dollar earned.' These have sup
ported the University since June,
1893, and it was a pleasure to take
for this use the gift of my husband
on the twenty-fifth anniversary of j
our marriage in 1875, for 1 con
sidered it was a sacred obligation
on my part to do the best possible
to keep the doors of the University |
open until this suit was finally de-:
eided favorably.
" I would receive what I had ex
pended and, if favorable, I would
have the blessed satisfaction of

knowing that I have used my best
endeavors. I also wish to add that
the experience of the last three
years, since my husband passed
away, has opened a new life to me.
1 find that there is more good in
human nature, more tenderness
and helpfulness than those who
live in affluence, who have no need
for sympathy and help, can ever
realize."—Call.
