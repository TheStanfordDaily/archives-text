# HOUSTON HALL.
## A 						Communication From an Authority on Pennsylvania's New Club House. 
### 
The following account of a new
feature in college life is especially
interesting to Stanford students,
who hope some day to see a, simi
lar feature here. Houston Mall is
unique in its way, and students of
the University of Pennsylvania are
very enthusiastic over it at the
present time.
Editor Daily Palo Alio:
The University of Pennsylvania
has recently inaugurated a novel
feature of student life, in the form
of a students' hall. The idea of such
a hall was conceived several years
ago, and has since become a reality
through the liberality of 11. H.
Houston, a friend and alumnus of
Pennsylvania, who donated $100,-
000, since increased to .$150,000, for
the purpose.
The hall was formally opened on
the evening of January '1 with a
smoker, to which every one con
nected with the university was in
vited. The management of the
hall is entirely in the hands of the
Houston Club, membership in
which is open to all graduates, un
dergraduates, professors, and offi
cers of the university upon pay
ment of a nominal yearly fee.
The object in the minds of the
founders of the hall was to provide
a home for university students,
where recreation would be afforded
under refining influences. Every
phase of human life has been con
sidered. and every want provided
for. The hall is in every way a
model club house, affording facili
ties for every proper pleasure. The
privileges to which the members
are eligible may be best realized by
a description of the building itself.
Entering from, the campus one
finds himself in a spacious recep
tion room, with open lire-places at
each end, and provided with com
fortable chairs for lounging and
conversation. To the right is the
billiard room, equipped with six of
the most approved billiard and pool
tables, and at either side are rooms
for smoking and conversation.
Occupying the extreme eastern
end of the lower floor is the reading
room. Here are to be found all the
best foreign and American reviews
and magazines, liles of daily news
papers from more than twenty
cities, and the most important col
lege publications, including all the
college dailies. Opening in ni the
room on the one hand is the chess
and checker room, and on the other
the correspondence room furnished
with the necessary writing mate
rials.
Two massive stairways lead to
the second floor. At the top of the
stairways are the trophy rooms,
where a collection of Penn's ath
letic trophies, medals and cups,
and photographs (if teams and
crews are at present being arranged.
Over the billiard room are the
rooms of the university Y. M. C. A.
and the bedroom and study of the
custodian. At the other end of the
hall is a large assembly room, with
a stage and dressing-room, which
may be utilized for numberless pur
poses. A pipe organ costingsB,ooo
lias just been placed in this room,

and a series of organ recitals is
promised for the near future.
Going up to the third floor a
number of compartments are found
for the use of the various student or
ganizations. The most striking is ;
the music room for the use of the j
musical clubs. This is fitted inar
tistic oak superbly carved, the j
whole effect being perhaps the most
pleasing in the hall. There is a ;
kitchen and a small cafe, while a
perfectly equipped dark-room is i
provided for the camera clubs.
Here also are the offices of the uni
versity publications.
The basement is entirely devoted
to recreation of one kind and an
other. At one end bowling alleys
and shuffle boards are arranged; at
the other are the gymnasium and
swimming pool. The latter is 1.50 |
by 50 feet in dimensions, lined
with marble, and provided with
means for altering the temperature
of the water. The depth varies j
from three to ten feet. Adjoining
are dressing-rooms and shower and ;
needle baths.
There is scarcely a fault to be I
found with a detail of plan, con
struction, or appointment, and the
hall is one of which Pennsylvania
men may well be proud.
