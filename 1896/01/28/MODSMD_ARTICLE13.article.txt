Thk opening of Pennsylvania's
new Houston Hall marks a new
step in the evolution of the mod
ern university. The greater Amer
ican colleges are outgrowing the old
ways. They have become too large
and too much divided into cliques
fora survival of college spirit and
of intimate relations among their
students. Several of the greater
universities, whose registration lias
passed the two thousand mark, are
casting about for some means of
holding their student body to
gether.
Pennsylvania's plan seems the
best one so far proposed. It provides
fora common house fora student
body which is in the nature of the
institution. Henceforth no man in
the University of Pennsylvania
need be isolated from his fellows or
kept apart from that communion
with kindred spirits which is after
all the best thing in college life.
