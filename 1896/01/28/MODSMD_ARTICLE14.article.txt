Ever since the law library was
opened there has been a continued
complaint that books are taken
from the room and a large part of
the class thereby deprived of their
use. In the general library there
has grown up the same abuse, and
professors who place their libraries
at the service of the students run a
very great risk of having their
shelves depleted and books pilfered
or lost. Such a practice is entirely
out of harmony with our University
teaching and especially with that
influence of which we are here so
proud.
University of California students
have voluntarily agreed to work to
gether with pick and spade, im
proving the lawns, laying out wa Iks,
and beautifying the college grounds.
Co-operation to this extent has
never been required of Stanford
students, but is does seem possible
that we might carry our socialistic
principles far enough to put a stop
to this evil. Those who are respons
ible for the present condition, who
are evidently lacking in the co
operative spirit —the spirit of mu
tual aid—should in some way or
other be made to perceive the
wrong they do their classmates.

The Tennis Club has decided to
I hold an extended tournament this
j semester and the new feature of
| percentage games will be introduced
j into it. This scheme of percentage
! games has been tried in various
| places and has been found to work
successfully, and there apparently
lis no reason why it should not do
| the same here. Jt will at least put
all the players, irrespective of
ability, on an equal footing; and
will do more towards awakening
the slumbering enthusiasm of mem
bers of the club than any thing
that could possibly have been done.
Under the rules of such a tourna
ment every member is required to
play with every other member a
certain number of games; and, of
course, this provision allows the
poorer players a chance fora brush
with the more expert.
On this account the tournament
ought to prove a most popular one,
for the inferior players have here
tofore been treated with scant con
sideration in contests of this sort,
j Now they have a chance to show of
I what they are made. The tourna
ment will not take the place of the
regular tournament which is to de
cide who shall represent us in the
intercollegiate contest, but will be
held before and. subsidiary to it,
and with an aim of putting the
contestants in the best possible con
dition for the more important
I struggle that is to follow.
