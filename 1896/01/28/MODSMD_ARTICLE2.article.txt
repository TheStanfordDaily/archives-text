# Will Hold a Tournament.
## 
### 
A meeting of the executive com
mittee of the Tennis Club was held
Friday afternoon, and it was de
cided to hold a club tournament in
the near future. A new feature, I
that of percentage games, will be
introduced and it is confidently ex
pected that it will arouse a great;
deal of enthusiasm among club
members. Every member will be
required to play with every other
member a series of thirteen games,
and whoever at the completion of!
the circuit has won the greatest
number of games will be declared
the winner of the tournament.
This scheme, it can readily be seen,
will give the inferior players a
chance to rub up against the better
players and will accomplish a great
deal toward awakening their inter
est in the contest.
The entries for the tournament
can be made at once with either!
the president or the secret a ry of the
club, and they will be open only to
club members. It is hoped to com
mence the games very soon, in fact
as soon as the weather will permit,
so as to run off a great part of the
tournament before the great con-1
test for intercollegiate honors.
