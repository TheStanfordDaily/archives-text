# Meeting of Glee Club.
## 
### 
The Glee Club held a meeting in
the chapel at 1:80 this afternoon
for the purpose of discussing the
advisability of giving a concert on
the campus in the near future. It
was decided to give such a concert,
and in all probability it will take
place some time in March. The
regular meetings of the club for
practice will hereafter take place
in the chapel at 1:80 p.m. on Mon
days, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
