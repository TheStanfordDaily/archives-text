The case of The State vs King
was argued before the Curtis Law
Club last night. The facts were as
follows: Jones, who was under
twenty-one years of age, was hired
by the prevention of vice society to
induce King, the defendant, to sell
him cigarettes. King, knowing
Jones to be under twenty-one, sells
him the cigarettes. There is a
statute in the state which makes
the selling of cigarettes to a minor
a felony. Jones is indicted for vio
lation of statute. The attorneys
for the state were Crow and Wills,
for the defendant, Stansbury and
De Wolfe. The case was argued
before Morgan, chief justice, with
Oskison, Stowe, Bigelow, and Roth
rock, associates.
After the hearing of the case, the
decision in the case argued at the
last meeting was read by Morgan,
chief justice.
Stansbury was elected president
and Stowe was elected clerk for
the semester.
