## 
### 
Prof. W alter Miller delivered the
regular Tuesday evening lecture
last evening, his subject being
"How 1 became a general in the
Greek arniv."
l'rof. Miller related in a thrilling
and interesting manner the experi
ences and adventures of his travels
through Northern Greece which led
up to the reception of his commis
sion as captain in the (ireek army.
The substance of his lecture was
about as follows:
Starting from Athens for the
historic places of Northern Greece
I'rofessor .Miller traveled without
a guide through groves of olives in
the midst of which Athens stands
in its splendor, ih rough picturesque
(ireek villages, over mountains,
and into the "historic plains of
Ma rathon."
"From Marathon on a beautiful
Sunday morning I started for the
ancient town of Pangora. Upon
coming to the road which led to
Delium, all the events concerning
the city of antiquity coming back
to me, I was tired with a desire to
see Delium. and turned my course
from its intended purpose.
'"I had not gone far before 1 met
two young men riding towards me.
Upon approaching them they
stopped and began questioning me
in a manner peculiar to the (ireek.
1 answered their* questions
promptly; and after they had
asked me everything concerning
myself, my parents, and my ances
tors. I, a (ireek among Greeks,
asked the same questions of them.
Then one of the young men having
asked me three times to hang my
traveling bag on the horn of his
saddle, and having been refused
three times, he at length gained his
object upon a fourth demand, as
sisting me at the same time to lift
the bags. Hiding slowly behind
him I saw the young man attempt
ing to open them. Noticing this 1
lifted the bags from his saddle and
again placed them upon a horse
that I led. Then at an unlooked
for moment the (ireek cut the lash
of my horse and he bounded away.
The pack not being securely fas
tened. fell from the horse. I imme
diately leaped to the ground and
picked up the pack. The Greek
sprang upon me, and that led me
to believe that the young men were
in earnest." The combat resulted
in a victory for the Greeks and a
loss to the lecturer of everything
he had. saving a few copper coins
undiscovered by the youths.
Fatigued and exhausted he set
out to find the nearest "demark."
Misled bv the statements made by
the natives as to the distances, Mr.
Miller walked sixty miles before he
arrived at the nearest railroad sta
tion, at first reported to be but
four hours'walk from the place of
his adventure.
Arriving at the station and hear
ing the sound of a distant whistle,
lie was informed that the last train
that night had started for Athens.
The next day he went to the min
ister of foreign affairs, to whom he
related the affair of his robbery.
Through the aid of the minister he
applied to the government for aid
in the apprehension of the thieves.
Impressed with the readiness and

fluency with which he could speak
(ireek, the minister not only lent
him the aid of the government for
the apprehension of the criminals,
but immediately gave him the com
mission of captain, and placed him
at the head of a formidable troop
ofiireek soldiers. "This was the
proudest moment of my life," said
the professor, "as I surveyed the
body of men at mv absolute dis
posal." At the head of these men
he proceeded into Northern Greece,
and after a long search for the
criminals they were finally found
and were convicted for their mis
deeds.
"Thus for ten years 1 have been
a captain in the Greek army, until
finally our Honorable I'rofessor
has elevated me to the position of
gene ral."
