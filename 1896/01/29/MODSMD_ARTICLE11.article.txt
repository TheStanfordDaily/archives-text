The present condition of the
wiilk from the campus entrance to
the railroad track at Palo Alto is
an outrage to this community.
Several days ago the boards were
I iiken np and work was begun on a
new walk. Now this work has been
suspended :nul the students are
compelled to wade through the
mud this rainy weather. Those
whose duty it is to keep up thin
walk have never pit id much at
tention to its condition, but they
have been unusually careless of
late. It is to be hoped that little
more time will be lost in complet
ing the new walk. En /tanxarit it
might be well to remark that the
interests of the pedestrians are not

in general very well looked after.
The University authorities spend a
great deal in providing good roads
for the buses and carriages, but
those who walk to and from Palo
Alto continue to do so through mud
and water.
