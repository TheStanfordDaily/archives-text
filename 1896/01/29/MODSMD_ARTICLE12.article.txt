The plan adopted by some of the
professsors, notably in the Eco
nomies department, of collecting
one dollar from each student for
tlie payment of syllabus fees and
the purchase of reference books, is
already meeting with gratifying
results and justifies fully the wis
dom of the professors in pursu
ing such a course. In ever\ r
class in which this fee has been col
lected a snug little sum has been
realized and a number of valuable
reference books purchased for the
use of the pupils in these classes.
Where before students have been
greatly inconvenienced by the scar
city of material for their library
reading, they are now able through
their own efforts to enjoy the much
more extended facilities, and all at
very little cost to themselves. Of
course the payment of this fee is
not compulsory upon any student,
but it is needless to say that all
are only too willing to assist in the
enlargement of the library, if it can
be done in such advantageous ways
as by the method adopted.
