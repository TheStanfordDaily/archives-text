# The
						Stanford Suit.
## 
### 
Arguments in the suit of thej
United States against the Stanford]
estate were heard yesterday. Mrs. |
Stanford was among the auditors;
and was represented by Joseph 11. j
Choate of New York.
The Assistant Attorney-General;
and the Solicitor-General in their |
arguments stated that the law of]
! California hound stockholders of
corporations to answer personally!
for their debts in proportion to]
their holdings of capital stock.
That Mr. Stanford was a stock-!
holder in the Central Pacific Kail-j
road Co. and the Western Pacific I
Railroad Co., two California cor- j
porations chartered in 1 <S<> 1 and)
1802 respectively, and consolidated]
in 1870 under the name of theCen- j
trai Pacific Railroad Co.
It was alleged that, under the j
I iiit.ed Stales' statutes of 18(>2. the]
Central Pacific Railroad Co. was j
loaned bonds amounting to $25,-!
885,120, and the Western Pacific j
Railroad Co. was loaned bonds
] amounting to $1 ,V)70,5C>0, to aid in j
building their railroads; that the j
I companies were obligated to pay
the United States the amount of
these bonds at their maturity to
gether with the interest upon the
same. The United States had paid
the interest and maturing bonds,
and no part of the principal ami
interest had been paid by the cor
poration. It was alleged that the
indebtedness to the United States]
on account of these bonds loaned to ]
| the railroads would amount to]
! $(>5,489,560; that these railroads
were insolvent, were covered with a
paramount mortgage exceeding
] their value, and that the United
i States had no remedy except against
the stockholders of said companies.
; The Government contended that
the railroads were indebted to the
: United States to the amount of the ]
bonds issued to them, and were oh-j
ligated to pay the same with in-j
Iterest; that the constitution of Cal
ifornia imposed upon the stock
holders a personal obligation fora
proportion of all debts and liabili
ties; that by no act had the United
States manifested an intent to ab
solve the Central Pacific Railroad
| Company from the obligations as
sumed by the companies or from
the liabilities imposed on the stock
holders.
Mr. Choate in his argument in
behalf of the defendant. Mrs. Jane
i Stanford, referred to the magnitude
of the claims as unparalleled. The
i claim demanded $15,000,000 from
the defendant and an equal amount
from the three associates of the de
fendant, amounting to $60,000,000.
I from four individuals solely because
j they held stock in the Central
Pacific Railroad Company. The
defense of the suit was based upon
four principal grounds.
First —That the successive acts of i
, Congress intended them to cover,
control, and regulate the entire
relations of the government to all
the companies with respect to the
subsidiary bonds, without reference
to the laws of any state; that the
com pa nies were created and adopted
as government instruments fora
great national purpose in which they
were to be subject to the federal
government; that the government
did not contemplate, rely upon, or

intend the personal liability of the
stockholders, but did intend that
there should be no such liability t<»
the government. Numerous de
cisions of the Supreme Court were
quoted.
Second—ln addition the estate
of Senator Stanford was also cer
tainly free from individual liabil
ity for the subsidiary bonds by the
law of California in force at the
time of the passage of the act of
1861 and also at the time of the is
sue of the bonds from 1860 to 1869.
Third—At the time of the con
tract between the United States
and the company, evinced by act
of Congress of July 1, 1862, there
was no liability of stockholders as
the Supreme Court of California
has uniformly held, as the right of
the L'nited States depends upon that
contract, and as no liability of
stockholders could be imposed by
subsequent legislation of California,
the bill set forth no cause of action
whatever.
Fourth—There was 110 obliga
tion to the Union and Central
Pacific Companies to repay the
moneys represented by the subsidi
ary bonds except according to the
act which imposed a statutory lien
for the subsidiary bonds without
personal liability.
The government aided the work
ns a national enterprise and gained
j great advantages by it.it could
send its mail, troops of war, and
control the operation of the road.
The government was a party to
that great national work.
Mr. Choate continues his argu
ment today.
