# The
						Stanford Suit Closed.
## 
### 
The arguments in the Stanford
suit were concluded yesterday.
Joseph Choate finished his argu
ment for the defense, and Solicitor
General Conrad followed for the
government. .Mr. Choate's plea
was most eloquent.
Mr. Choate, in continuing his ar
gument, held that at the time of
the act of 1862 there was not, un
der the laws of California, stock
holder's liability for the debts of a
corporation, ami that these stock
holders could not he made liable by
any subsequent act of the Califor
nia Legislature. No stockholder's
liability could have then existed,
unless under the Constitution of
California, and the Supreme Court
of California has held that consti
tutional provision not to he self-ex
ecuting, by a decision that has
stood for thirty years.
Mr. Choate insisted that, accord
ing to the act of 1 862, as construed
in the Supreme Court, it was clear
that the company was under no ob
ligations for the repayment of the
bonds, except as provided in the
act.
In conclusion, Mr. Choate rested
the case on these propositions:
First, that Congress intended to
make and did make itself sovereign
in the whole business covered by
the Pacific Railroad Company, not
to rely upon the laws or aid of any
state: that all the companies were
to he upon an equal footing, and
the Central Pacific was not singled
out alone to furnish indemnity to
t he government by the personal li
abilitv of its stockholders.
Second, that by the law of Con
gress, as construed by the courts,
there was no such thing as individ
ual liability of stockholders at the
time the contract was made between
the Central Pacific Company and
the government, and hence the de
fendant is not liable.
Third, that even if the liability
did exist, it was only :i qualified li
ability, according to the la w of Cal
ifornia, as construed bv its courts,
limited to the condition that it
should mature and be enforceable
within three years from the date
when the liability was created.
When the United States made the
bonds for thirty years, it necessar
ily excluded the possibility of any
stockholder's liability.
Fourth, that by the true con
struction of the act of Congress, il
lustrated and guid< d by the decis
ions of the Su|(feme Court.the com
panies themselves are only liable
for the repayment of the bonds,
upon the conditions and in the
manner provided in the act, and
therefore the defendant *is not
Mr. Choate resented strongly the
personalities against the memory
of (tovernor Stanford.
I n conclusion, he urged as speedy
a decision as was consistent with
the other duties of the court, and
referred to the exigencies of the de
fendant and of the University. As
a precedent for speaking of the
University, he cited the example of
Webster speaking for Dartmouth
('ol lege.
Solicitor General Conrad then
closed the case for the government,
lie argued that the Central Pacific
was a corporation created bv the

State of California, and was so rec
ognized and contracted with by the
United States Government, and
that the company had no life, save
that given it by its California char
ter. He held that every stock
holder of the Central Pacific Com
pany was liable for its debts, and
denied that the act of 1862 con
tained the whole contract between
the government and the roads.
He also denied that the Union
Pacific and the Central Pacific
Railroads were subject to the same
conditions.
Congress saw that under the
constitution and laws every stock
holder of the Central Pacific was
liable for its debts, and no stipula
tion for such security was needed;
it was imposed by the operation of
law. He held that this liability
was recognized by capitalists in
general, and was a principal ob
stacle in securing subscriptions to
the stock.
It is understood from friends of
Mrs. Stanford and from other
sources that the Supreme Court
may reach a decision in the case
not later than next Monday.* The
Chief Justice has heretofore an
nounced that upon Monday the
court will take a recess until
March 1, and if the Stanford de
cision is not handed down next
week, the friends of Mrs. Stanford
are convinced that the conclusion
of the court will be made public as
soon as the court convenes in
March.
