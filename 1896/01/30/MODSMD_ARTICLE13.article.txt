Somk people seem to forget that
in the work of petting out a daily
—especially such a one as the
Daily Palo Alto, all the work
upon which is voluntary—it is
sometimes impossible to avoid
slight errors. They expect a news
paper to he infallible, overlooking
the haste in which it is necessarily
produced. They do not reflect that
where all the reportorial work is
done by students amid the hustle
and press of the thousand and one
tasks that crowd upon a university
man, the minute verification of
every little statement is impossible.
The Daily Palo Alto has not a
paid staff. Those who write its
matter do so through loyalty to the
I'Diversity, to the paper, and to the
student body. If these facts were
borne in mind, possibly there would
he less disposition to criticize and
a greater appreciation of efforts
which are unrewarded and wholly
unselilsh. In student institutions
of every kind slight short-comings
are to be condoned rather than
harshly criticized.
