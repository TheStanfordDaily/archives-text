<>N'io of (lie most remarkable facts
con nee I c( [ w i I h I in- S .1 i ford suit
from its beginning, lia- !><cii the
apathy towards tliis institution —
or ratlier 11 it> thin-veiled hostility
—displayed by :i large portion of
the press of this state. Friends of
Stanford University do not com
plain because they have any
grounds to fear that such hostility
at all lessens our chances of suc
cess in the momentous legal light
now drawing to a close; but they
do complain—and with good cause
— that the coolness evinced in so
many California newspapers as re
gards the future of the University
reveals the utter ignorance of the
reputation which this institution
has given the state in educational
circles the world over, as well as a
serious' misapprehension of our
aims.
We venture to assert that none
of the American universities are
more widely known throughout the
ICnglish speaking world than is
Stanford. Notwithstanding that
her career has been so short, her

reputation has spread with truly j
j marvellous rapidity; and the fact;
that students are drawn yearly
| from every part of the Union and
i so many from foreign countries, af-j
! fords proof of the statement. It is |
j gratifying, moreover, to learn from j
! strangers and visitors, as well asi
'from students who come here from
T '
j distant places, that Stanford Uni
versity is not only widely but fav
orably known. It does not become
us to sound our own praises; but in
simple justice we think it can be
said, that, with the'exception of
Chicago, no university, at least in
j this country, has ever acquired a
fame so extensive in so short a
| period of time?
I It is,felt that a good deal of the
j apathy with which the University
has had to contend in its native
state is due to the loyalty of the
people toward the University of
California. Such loyalty is en
! tirely praiseworthy. Hut, as so
frequently pointed out, there is no
j sound reason why it should imply i
I hostility to a friendly institution.
Honest merit never suffers through
honest, go<>d-nature<l emulation.
{And surely in the great State of
i California destined, no doubt, to
be one of the chief centers of popu
lation in the Union—there is room
! for two great universities ! Stan
| ford was not created to injure and
retard the sister institution at
Berkeley, nor is it any part of her
present aim to do so. Anything
j that hurts Stanford can not truly
j benefit our friends across the bay
and must in the long run hurt the
I State of California. Sooner or
j later the people here are going to
! see things in that light.
