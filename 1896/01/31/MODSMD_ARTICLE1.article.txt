Tlie following is all outlineof the
first lecture given in the Popular
Science Series, delivered by Prof.
.). I*. Smith last evening. 'I he at
tendance was lair, and those pres
ent enjoyed a most instructive lec
ture.
California includes several sys
tems of mountains, the most im
portant of which are the Sierra Ne
vadas, extending from the north
eastern part of the state south to
Tejon Pass, where it swings west
ward and joins the Coast Range.
The Sierras reach an elevation of
15,000 feet, and have mostly a
westerly sloping surface, bearing
numerous west-flowing streams.
The eastern slope of the mountain
drops abruptly 5.000 feet. The
western flank of t lie mountains con
tains the auriferous slates, but its
main mass is granitic.
The Coast Range is about (550
miles long, a nd averages about 4,000
feet in height. It is made up of a
number of parallel chains of about
the same height. At the north the
Coast Range joins the Klamath
.Mountains, an irregular mass with
a granitic cen.cr. The Coast Range
is continued at the south by the
Sierra Madre. The trend of these
mountains is at an angle to the
Coast Range and to the coast, and
therefore belongs to another moun
tain system.
Another topographic province
is the southern end of the Cascade
system, running down through the
north-central part of the state, in
cluding Alt. Shasta and Lassen
Peak and the lava sheet poured out
over the north-eastern part of the
state.
In the south-eastern part of the
state, in the White Mountains, the
Panainiint Range, and Death Val
ley. there is presented another to
pographic feature in the the steep,
parallel mountain ranges, and
the narrow intervening valleys,
showing a fault system of topogra
phy extending down from Nevada
and dying out further in the south
in a desert and sand-covered sys
tem.
At the western foot of the Sierra
Mountains lies the state's great
valley, which is about (500 miles
long and over 100 miles broad.
Other valleys of less importance
are the Salinas, the Santa Clara,
and the Russian River. All these
valleys are of late origin.
We naturally look upon the hills
as everlasting, and land as term
finna, or unchangeable, but such is
far from the fact. There is no part
of the earth that is not constantly
changing in elevation and in lon
gitude and latitude. Each drop of
falling water dissolves some min
eral substance from the rocks with
which it conies in contact, and as
these drops accumulate into brooks
and rivers, sediments are carried
along in suspension and depos
ited on lower levels or in the sea.
In high altitudes streams cut
deep canyons, but as lower eleva*
tions are reached, or as the moun
tains are worn down, the channels
widen out, forming broad flood
plains and narrow, intervening
ridges. Then these ridges are worn
away, and the whole country is
worn down to a low. level plain.

Such forces as glacial action and
! volcanoes are of small importance.
In the Archaean time thereprob
; ably was land surface about the
south end of the Sierras.
In Cambrian times there was
ja sea lying to the east of the pres-
I ent crest of the Sierras, for at the
eastern foot are found Cambrian
strata.
In Silurian ami Devonian times
there was a sea covering a portion
of Northern California and depos
iting fossiliferous limestones, but
we know little of the land areas.
In Carboniferous times a sea ex
| tended east of the Sierras and over
* a large part of Northern California.
I The sediments and fauna are open
I sea types, so the position of land
| areas is not known.
In Triassic times an open sea
[spread over much the same area as
: in the Carboniferous.
In the beginning of the .Jura the
I same open sea conditions existed
and the fossils show a temperate
climate. L.niestones and slates
| were deposited. Rut the top beds
iof the Jura show a change of cli
j mate in the Alaskan and Siberian
I faunas, showing the opening up of
| the sea to the north and cold cur
: rents from that direction. At the
end of the Jurassic time the whole
coast region was uplifted, but the
Klamath mountain and Coast
i Range region were again sub-
I merged.
During Cretaceous times the cli
; mate became milder, the ocean bot
tom at the foot of the Sierras un
derwent subsidence as it received
: the sediments from the adjoining
| land. The interior basin region
I was a land area cutting off the seas
1 from the east, so that the Cali-
I '
j fornia Cretaceous marine fauna has
! no species common to that east of
: the interior region. Rut the Cal
ifornia Cretaceous fauna is like tluit
of India and South Africa, showing
I open sea connections with those
! regions.
During Tertiary times the Coast
! region was a coastal plain, a sub
j marine platform and an archipel
ago.
In the northern part of the Sier
ras are found at elevations from
j 6000 to 9000 feet Tertiary river
beds filled with gravel. River ba
sins can be formed only at low
; levels, and rivers do not deposit
j gravel at high elevations. So dur-
I ing this time the Sierra region was
worn down nearly to a base level
|or a pure plain condition and has
| since been uplifted.
During the time of the gravel
j deposition, Northern California
! was a scene of great volcanic ac
i tivity.
During Pliocene times the Coast
Range region underwent great sub
sidence. accumulating a vast thick
ness of sediments. Near the end of
the Pliocene time an elevation took
place, lifting up the Coast Range,
land at the same time the Death
Valley region began to sink. The
increased erosive activity on the up
turned Pliocene strata rapidly wore
1 hem down to a plane, and then
by an epurogenie movement this
j plain was lifted into a plateau,
which has been dissected by
streams, until we have the succes
sion of parallel ridges of the Coast
Range.
