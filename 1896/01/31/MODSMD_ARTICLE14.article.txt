Twk initial lecture of a most
valuable series was delivered in the
chemistry lecture room last evening
and for the coming fourteen weeks
these lectures will be given regularly
every Thursday evening. The
Popular Science Course has been ar
ranged for the special edification of
those whose studies have little to
do with practical scientific sub
jects. Each lecture will be
made as free from technicalities as
possible, in order to interest the
students generally. The topics for
discussion have been arranged with
special regard t<> the practical value
of each discourse, and the selections
have generally been assigned to
those who are specialist* on the
subjects treated.
Few students are aware of the
fact that all these lectures are just
so much extra work for the pro
fessors. In most institutions when
a professor delivers a lecture either
in an extension series or before
students, he is permitted t<> take
necessary time from class work.
Here, this extra work is voluntary
and is another proof of the willing
ness of the faculty to do all that
lies within their power to add to
the popularity of University work.
A vote of t hanks is due those under
taking such a meritorious work.
