# The 						Encina Banquet.
## 
### 
The second dinner given by the
men of Encina to the young ladies
of Roble was given Friday evening!
in Encina dining-room. The hall
had been tastefully decorated with
palms, ferns, and ivy, and presented j
an attractive appearance in strong'
contrast to its accustomed barren-j
ness. The guests began to arrive
about six o'clock. At half j
past six, when dinner was an-!
nounced, fully two hundred and j
tiftv persons passed into the dining- j
room.
The following menu was served: j
Cream of Tomato
Olives Celery
Patties a la Mare
Roast Young Veal, with dressing
Mashed Potatoes
Green Peas
Orange Water Ice
Assorted Cake
Fruit
Dates Nuts Raisins
Cafe Noii-
After dinner President Jordan
responded to the toast "College
Society," dwelling particularly on i
some late phases in the develop-'
ment of co-education; and Miss
Toles, 'H9, responded in a charming
little speech to "College Spirit.''
Adjournment was then taken to
the lobby, where a short program
was rendered. Sutherland, '99,
sang "When 1 Grow Up"'; Wells,
'1)7, rendered a violin solo, with j
beautiful expression; llulme, '97,
gave a sympathetic rendition of his
own song "Unreturning," and res
ponded to an encore with Shelley's
'"Love's Sorrows"; and DeWolfe, I
i
"9(S, gave a comic monologue. The j
hit of the evening was made by I
Dillon, '99, in his dialect songs and
recitations. He was compelled to
respond to several encores. The
''Chiinmie Kadden" impersonation
was especially good.
Conversation and a general good
time followed until after 10 o'clock, |
when the inexorable lights put an
end to Enema's second venture in
the social world.
