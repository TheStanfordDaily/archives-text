Are not we college students of the
present day outgrowing our enthu
siasm? Is not the, reaction against
the boisterous type of student of a
decade ago going too far? Colleges
are in fashion just now, largely,
perhaps, on account of this very en
thusiasm. Blase Madam tirundy
found a healthy, natural, unre
strained sort of creature, a new
type, which she elected to favor,for
a time, with her fickle attachment.
College men and women, on the
other hand, have felt this influence,
and have 'Honed down" to meet the
conventionalities of polite society.
They have put themselves under a
little restraint; have abolished a
little of that free and easy Bohem
ianism of the old days.
This is all very well. The col
lege spirit of those times was en
tirely too free; college enthusiasm
too wild in its manifestation. But
we are running towards a more
dangerous extreme. At Harvard,
for years the leader in American
thought, there is so little college
spirit that this fall Harvard men
hardly cheered their struggling
athletes in the close and exciting
game with Pennsylvania, a game
held on their own campus, and in
sight of their own student body.
The newspapers of Boston are com
menting on the blase indifference
of the "Harvard variety of the hu
man young" -ibis at t he university
which sent whole graduating
classes into the Civil War, and
whose patriotic spirit was only
equaled then bv her college spirit.
Alumni and faculties at the
greater universities are complain
ing that the students hardly know
one another, that the best athletes

refuse without cause, other than in
difference, to try for varsity teams, J
and that their athletes are not sup-j
ported.
The college craze is a good thing;
for society at large, but is it in the]
end good for the colleges themselves?
Assuredly, if it is going to deprive
us of our youthful, healthy optim
ism, if it is going to render us in
different, if it is going to take the
vitalizing force from life's elixir, it
is not. Indeed, influential college
men are already taking steps to
remedy this indifference, to break
up the exclusive spirit of cliques, to
bring back something of the old,
social, democratic feeling which
was at the bottom of student en
thusiasm. Harvard and Pennsyl
vania are forming University Clubs;
other institutions are moving in the
same direction along other lines.
It may be long before we at Stan
ford stand in need of a club of this
sort, but we do need to guard
against that miasma which is af
fecting the older institutions and is
already making itself somewhat ap
parent in our midst.
