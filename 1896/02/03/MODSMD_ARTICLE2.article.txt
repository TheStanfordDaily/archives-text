# Meeting of Track Men.
## 
### 
A large number of men. respond
ing to the call of Captain Toombs,
met in the gymnasium Saturday
at 10 a.m. Captain Toombs pre
sided and made a brief speech con
taining valuable suggestions for
trackmen. He urged at present
faithful work in the gymnasium
and faithful and careful training in
the future. He showed the neces
sity of regular habits and regular
hours, lie expressed his gratifica
tion at the interest shown and his
belief that a creditable team could
be turned out without a coach,
lie warned the new men not to be
come discouraged in a few days or
weeks, but to be persevering and
may be they would be successful.
He urged the men to specialize in
their events.
Hernhard, '96, said that if the
men were faithful and did their
best, he thought a successful team
could be turned out.
Mr. Hetherington was called
upon and gave the men a brief
talk, lie showed how the success
of a team depended not entirely

upon the men who obtained first in
their events hut upon the men who
got second and third. He depre
cated discouragement and timidity
to train for the track "because some
one has a cinch on an event." It
requires more than one year to
turn out a successful athlete. Fven
if they do not make the team they
must consider the physical benefit.
Jm view of not having a coach he
suggested turning the new men
over to those who had specialized
in events and had formerly trained
under a coach.
Dole, '98, urged obedience to the
captain as of great importance.
Captain Toombs said that they
hoped to set up a training table the
last four or six weeks, and to have
professional 'rubbers'' from the
city. He asked the men to report
Monday at 4:80 p.m., as the track
would then be in shape for work.
