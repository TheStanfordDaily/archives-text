It is the intention of the track au
thorities to hold an interclass field
day some time during the coining
month, primarily for the purpose
of arousing a more general interest
in the sport, and secondarily for af
fording comparison between the
relative merits of the different
classes in track athletics. With
this consideration in mind, three of
the classes of the University have
elected track managers and cap
tains for their teiims. The one
that has not as yet taken any steps
iu the matter is the Class of '97.
If it is to have a team this year,
interested members of the class
should see to it that the proper rep
resentatives are elected by the
class or appointed by the presi
dent. But a short time remains
before the field-day will be held,
and all haste is urged in the
matter.
