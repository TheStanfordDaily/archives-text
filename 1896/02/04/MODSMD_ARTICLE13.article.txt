Thk bicycle ordinance passed
some time ago by the I'alo Alto
town board has been repealed at
the petition of most of the prom
inent merchants of that enterprising
town. It appears that the ordi
nance passed unknown to many of
the merchants and in opposition to
the wishes of many more who recog
nized that no such law was neces
sary in a place of that size, and
that its effect might be disastrous
in the end. The law was given a
trial, however, and demonstrated
its own absurdity. Objections were
heard from all sides, and the mer
chants finally took up the matter
and induced the authorities to re
peal the obnoxious measure. The
result is gratifying to a large num
ber of students who reside at or do
business jn Palo Alto and who
were chiefly affected by the ordi
nance.
