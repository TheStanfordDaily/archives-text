Considering the fact that yester
day was practically the lirst favor
able opportunity <>112 this year for
the work of track athletes and base
hall men, the number of men on
hand for practice in both branches
of sport was fully np to expectations.
In track athletics the season opens
up with bright prospects, but these
may be easily dimmed by a lack of

interest or by an unwillingness to
train conscientiously. Now is the
time for all trackmen to show what
they are made of and how much
interest they take in Stanford's
prestige. Their work can't help
showing it.
In baseball our chances of win
ning were never more precarious,
but the honor of a victory will he
augmented by the very existence of
such unfavorable conditions. There
is every opportunity this season
fora fairly good player to make
the team; and to make the Varsity
baseball nine is but second in
honor to making the Varsity
eleven. To make the team, how
ever, should be considered as noth
ing with winning the intercollegiate
championship. Let every man who
works faithfully feel that he is
helping his college out of an unfor
tunate position.
Finally, let every man, he he a
baseball player or a candidate for
track honors, remember Camp's in
junction, to "feel proud to be able to
assist athletics of his college, even
though he may never get a first
place or make the team." It is the
ordinary athlete who works so
steadily that he forces a better man
to exert himself to the utmost, who
wins the points, though indirectly,
for his college.
