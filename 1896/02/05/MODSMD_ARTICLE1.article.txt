About fifteen men responded to i
('apt. Mc Lai lie's cull for prsn^tice!
last night. The work was some
what better than the first practice,
particularly the infield.
Although rather early in thej
season, il is sale to say that Stan-1
ford will put a strong team into the
field this year. A nuniher of fresh-j
man candidates appear to he veter
ans at the hat and will give some of!
the Varsity men a hard ruh to hold
their positions.
Some of the new men who ap
peared last night were Cotton, 'V>B. j
Freeman,'V)9, Mc( Joy,*«'!(, and ()s- 1
good, "V>7. (Jotton and Osgood will j
try for catcher's position, while
Freeman and McCoy are infield
Candida tes.
Among the new students, Taylor!
and Sharp are among the k'phe
lioms." Sharp is somewhat un-1
certain and shows lie is out of i
practice. Taylor, as short and sec-1
ond, made some brilliant plays.!
St roll n, Montgomery, Mcintosh,;
and Wight also did good work on
the infield.
Morrison and Jeffs did good work
in the outfield. Thompson i: ; out ]
of practice and failed to do himself
justice. Stanshery might lie put
on the same list as Thompson.
It is too early to give anything
definite ahoiit the new players.
Stanford has been misled too often
by "crack" men both in baseball
and football. It will be better to
watch the men play and report on
their meriis. than to take them on
their previous records.
'1 he first practice game will be
played Saturday, on the diamond,
when Capt. McLaine will have an
opportunity to observe the new men
under fire. The time of the game
will be announced later.
