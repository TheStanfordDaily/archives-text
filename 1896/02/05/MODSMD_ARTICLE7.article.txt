# Sermon by Bishop Nichols.

### 
The Sunday sermon was deliv
ered by Bishop Nichols of San 1
Francisco. The Bishop took for
his text Matthew xxii. <>: "It thine
eye be single, thy whole body shall
be full of light." A very brief
synopsis of his remarks follows:
A double metaphor is used in the
text. In the first place the eye is
spoken of as the light of the body,
the lamp of the body, as it is in the
revised edition. It explains the
relation of the eye to the body by
the relation of the lamp to the
light. The second figure, that of
comparing the spirit to the mind,
was a familiar one to the Greeks.
Aristotle said as sight is to the eye,
so mind is to the spirit. Under
standing this, then, we have the
text as giving the means to an end,
the right use of an organ to the
finding of the fullest truth.
To be single in eye means a
singleness of head and action, see
ing things without folds. We speak
of something unfolding to the
vision; and this seeing things with
out folds is singleness of eye, clear
headedness. If the mind is clear
headed in the fullest capacity, then
the whole bodv shall be filled with
light.
There are many things in these
times to make men want to be
right. They oftentimes find them
selves puzzled. In the Venezuelan
[question, when the evidence is all
in, the question will arise, what is
right? Jt needs a single eye to see
what is right. The single eye, the
| clear head, these two things are
brought together in the text, and
with them the search for truth may
reasonably be expected to be suc
cessful.
