# A 						Recent Publication, the Work of a Stanford Student.
## 
### 
An interesting addition to the se
ries of Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity publication* in the field of
history and economics is the mon
ograph recently published, on ''The
Official Relations Between the Uni
ted States and the Sioux
The author of tlle study, Miss Lucy
E. Tex tor, M. A., has succeeded in
presenting, in an entertaining and
lucid style, this chapter in one of
the most interesting, if most neg
lected, departments of American
history. Comprising one hundred
and sixty-two pages, and including
amongst its other matter maps, sta
tistical tables, and a complete bib
liography, Miss Textor's study may
be regarded as an important con
tribution to the minute investiga
tions now being carried on by a
host of historical students with a
view to the collection and interpre
tation of all the facts bearing on
the past of our own country. In
an editorial note Prof. Howard
points out that "the material for
our social, institutional, and ad
ministrative history is to be
gathered." It is gratifying to know
that Stanford is sustaining its share
of the investigation.
It was through the generous ap
preciation of Mr. Joseph Hutchin
son of l'alo Alto that Miss Textor's
paper was published, and to that
gentleman the historical depart
ment is therefore under a debt of
gratitude.
The author begins by an outline
of the Indian policy of this country.
In a rapid hut comprehensive man
ner she outlines the original policy
lof this government, the modifica
t ions it has undergone, and the pres
jent attitude of both government
and people on the much debated
Indian question. She then passes
! to the Sioux Indians and describes
j minutely the treaty relations be
tween that nation and the govern
| ment at Washington, closing with
i a summary of the present attitude of
j the Sioux and their probable future.
Miss Textor's work is not one
! that will l>e of great interest to the
j general reader; it is intended as a
! reliable collection of data for the
guidance of future students of the
greatest, fiercest, and most intel
ligent of the North American In
dian tribes.
The author has avoided the fault
I common to historical writers, of
â–  overlooking literary style. The
ideas are conveyed throughout in a
plain, finished, and accurate style
which makes the work delightfully
easy reading.
