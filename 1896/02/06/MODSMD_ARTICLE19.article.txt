The Class of '95 set ;i good ex
ample l>y founding, in the senior
year of that famous body, a per
manent Stanford institution, the
sophomore-freshman "hatchet bury
ing." This idea of having each
successive class leave some addi
tion to our meager stock of tradi
tions is a good one. We are all
fond of grumbling at the''newness"
of the life here, and at the lack of
these same little institutions which
make university life so pleasant
and so distinctive. There can be
no more practical way of remedy

ing this defect than the adoption,
hy each succeeding graduating
class, of some new custom.
If ' ( J(j intends to follow the ex
ample of the glorious "Pioneers,"
we would suggest the wearing of
the cap and gown for their consid
eration. This distinctive univer
sity badge is the emblem of senior
ity over all the college world, and
it would add a picturesque feature
to our cloisters.
