:i brief discussion a motion was
carried providing for the appoint
ment of a committee of nine, by the
president, to canvass the sentiment
of the class.
Motions to appoint a committeee
of five on arrangements for the sen

for making the necessary arrange
ments for Commencement week,
were carried. The appointments

Mr. llanscomb of Darmorth,
is thinking of getting out a class
book containing cuts of the class,

faculty, college teams, and views of
the grounds; and a motion giving
him the sanction of the class was
brought forward, but laid on the
table until a more delinite idea of
his project could be obtained.
