# Free Concert in the Chapel.

The pianoforte recital to be given
in the chapel tomorrow evening bv
Miss Ida Shelley, promises to be
the most finished exhibition of its
kind which ever took place at Stan
ford. It is seldom that such an op
portunity as this is given Stanford
students to hear such a program as
has been arranged, and large num
bers of the students will doubtless
take advantage of this occasion.
All seats are free.
