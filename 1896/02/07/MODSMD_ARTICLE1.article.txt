# "The Ethics of Social Reconstruction."

### 
Professor Edward I!, 'iriggs de
livered the Tuesday evening lecture
and was listened to throughout
with profound attention. A short
abstract of ihe lecture follows:
Our time is one of great social
unrest; vast changes are taking
place, and there are many lofty
hopes as to what the future will
bring forth. These hopes at times
are ideals toward which we should
struggle; at other times they are
vain dreams, impossible of realiza
tion, from the very nature of life.
The recognition of the laws that
regulate social progress is essen
tial to a wise attitude toward
tbe prevailing unrest.
The causes of social progress are
many and interacting. Every
cause is to some extent the effect of
an earlier one, and it is impossible
to reach an absolute beginning.
Ilaec-kel has said that in Nature
"little causes produce the great re
sults"'; anil t his is supremely true in
the moral world. Yet the mul
titude of canst s of social progress
falls naturally under three main
headings: changes in the law and
institutions; progress in invention
and discovery; and changes in in
dividual ideals of life. These
causes are found interacting in
every vital period of history; yet
we generally find that the cause
which lies furthest back is the
subtle change in the ideal of life.
Thus in the rebirth of Europe, be
hind the momentous changes, the
discoveries that added a new world
to the consciousness of men, and
the inventions that made education
possible to the common man, lay
the entire change in the ideal of
life. 'This change began far back
in the Middle Ages; and it became
in the Renaissance that "redis
covery of man and nature"' which
determined the character of mod
ern civilization.
Social progress must always
be slow, since it results chiefly trom
the modification of ideals of life;
while social evils are in part the in
evitable result of the law of
struggle, and in part are due to the
co-existence of high and low types
in every society. (Sudden leaps in
progress are only possible when
force has been gathered up under
the surface during a long period of
time.
Hence "schemes" always fail.
Every reformer overrates the im
portance of his measure. Substan
tial progress may result, but no re
form has brought the Golden
lCpoch, whether called "l'ant.soe
racy," "Communism," "Republic,"
or "Brook Farm." And no reform
ever will bring the Golden Epoch,
whether it is Prohibition, Woman
Suffrage, Tax, or Currency Reform,
or Altruria. The most that any
of these can accomplish is an im
provement of certain social condi
tions, and a modification of ideals
of life which may lead to further
progress; but human nature will re
main much the same, and greed
and selfishness will find an oppor
tunity to assert themselves.
We err in imagining that a con
dition of statical perfection iseither
possible or desirable in human
society. This is the error at the
basis of most Utopias. It shows in

the first and noblest of them,
Plato's Republic. Plato sacrifices
the expansion and development of
individual life to the perfecting of
a permanent type of social organi
zation. For instance: the banish
ment of the poets, the destruction
of the family, and other mistakes.
A similar error shows in Campa
nella's City of the Sun, Bacon's
j New Atlantis, Moore's Utopia, Bel
lamy's Looking Backward. Many
of these assume further the exist-
I ence of impossibly perfect officials
and philosophers.
Life is always dynamic and pro
gressive; only while there is growth
is there life. Hence life must in
evitably be incomplete and im
| perfect. Progress must be slow,
| since it results chiefly from the
modification of individual ideals of
| life.
Hence the ethical attitude to-
I ward problems of social recon-
I struction is evident:
1. HI very helpful reform should
i be welcomed. Especially when a
reform in which we believe is unpop
ular, when it is on the modern
; rack of ridicule and contempt, does
i it need all the assistance which it
is in our power to give.
2. Yet we must recognize the
limitations in any reform and not
exaggerate its importance. The
fanaticism with which narrow
| reforms have been urged has many
j times hindered true social progress.
We should seek to do everything
1 in our power to elevate individual
ideals through education. This is
the constant reform problem. It is
impossible to estimate the worth of
one man absolutely consecrated to
a noble aim. Twelve men once
I changed the aspect of the world;
(and twelve men devoted entirely to
: a common end might do the same
i thing again at any time. Not that
j we could hope for any sudden
dawning of the Golden Epoch; but
wide changes in social condition
would result from the spreading of
nobler ideals of life.
4. We should seek to carry out
I the highest ideal in our personal
life. To fulfill our personal duties
in social relations is to do much of
what lies in our power in aiding
! the solution of the problem of so
j cial reconstruction. The primary
philanthropy is to lead a good
life.
People for whom life is easy find
it difficult to appreciate the condi
tion of the masses. Aristocratic
prejudices are the result, and, in
! turn, the cause of artificial social
conditions. There is in every so
ciety the danger of settling down
into fixed forms. But the individ
ual will is the moving power in his
tory. As in the organic world var
iation occurs only in individuals,
so in the moral world every move
ment begins as a. thought in some
man's mind. Il is the history of
every reform the world has seen
that it began as an inspiration in
personal life, gradually took shape
and became an institution, and
ended as a dead form. Hence there
is a need for the perpetual affirma
tion of the individual will and
ideal. Thus we can see the value
of social unrest. With all its eco
nomic waste, t he wide-spread social
unrest is the most hopeful sign in
our country today ; for it indi

cates that we are alive, and not
dead.
To live the highest ideal we know,
to enter into the humanity of every
life that touches ours, and do all in
our power to make it realize more
fully its manhood and womanhood,
is to serve in the largest way the
progress of social reconstruction.
