The lack of interest that mem
bers of the upper classes exhibit in
the debating societies can be pro
ductive of only harm to our debat
ing interests. Ju the past it has
been largely through the efforts of
our two principal societies that
Stanford has been aide to defeat
Berkeley in debating. At first the
enthusiasm and practice gained in
t hese societies brought about sharp
competition for a place among our
debating representatives; but re
cently, indifference to our debating
societies has produced a marked
change. Instead of the large num
ber of contestants that formerly
characterized the trial debates, it is
with difficulty now that the re
quired number can be induced to
enter the contest. The only way to
account for this is through the
apathy that the members of the
Iwo upper classes exhibit towards
the debating societies. There is
undoubtedly considerable first-class
material among these classes that
is never heard of, simply because
many of those who can debate bold
aloof from the societies. The upper
classmen are responsible for this
condition, and they should dis
charge their duty to themselves and
to the Iniversity by supporting the
debating societies. "
