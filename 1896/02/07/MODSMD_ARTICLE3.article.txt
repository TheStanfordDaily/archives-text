# Track Notes.
## 
### 
Last evening the number of ath
letes at work on the track had in
creased to twenty. The sprinters
seem to be doing the most ener
getic work, with the weight men
good seconds. Dole is doing some
training at the hurdles, but no one
is as yet broad-jumping or pole
vaulting. The following men were
out last evening: Dole, Smith, Bell,
Brown, Capt. Toombs, Hoi brook,
Brunton, Wilkinson, Scale, B.
Thomas, M. Johnson, Bernhard.
Fiekert, Freeman, and Wilson.
