# Baseball Practice,

'The work of the men last evening
| was encouraging in one sense, that
is that the players worked with a
will and stayed with the practice
I for about two hours. In one way,
| however, the practice was dis
appointingâ€”too few men were on
! hand to have played a practice
I game. A number of the men
i showed up well. The infield seemed
j stronger than the outfield. This
may have been due to the fact that
the men at the bat nearly the whole
time were very weak and sent few
balls into the outfield. More men
should be put to work batting and
more players should turn out to
regular practice. Among those
whose work was noticeable last
night were McLaine, Young, .left's,
Taylor, Bell, Wight, Thompson,
Sta nsbery, Sharp, Freeman, Strohn,
Leppo, Austin, and Osgood. James.
! '97, was on hand last night for
: work.
