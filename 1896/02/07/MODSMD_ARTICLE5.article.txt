# Regarding New Lamps.
## 
### 
When new lamps are needed to
replace those burned out or other
wise out of repair, the old lamps
must be returned to the electrician
before the new ones will be sup
plied. If the old lamps are not so
returned, the cost of each new lamp
(25 cents) will be charged to the
person wishing it.
