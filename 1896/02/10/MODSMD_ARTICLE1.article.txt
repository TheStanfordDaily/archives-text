The debate between the repre
sentatives of Stanford and the Uni-j
versity of California for the Carnot
medal offered annually by I >;«ron
de Coubertin of France, took ]>laeei
at Stiles Mali, Berkeley, Friday
evening. M. C. Flaherty of the
I*. C. was awarded the medal.
The question for debate was, "Is
the centralized form of the French
government favorable to the stabil-i
ity of the republic?" The debaters j
for the affirmative were: 11. D.;
Sheldon, Stanford; F. S. Howard, j
Stanford; M. C. Flaherty, Univers
ity of California. For the negative
were: E. 1. Miller, Stanford; C. 10.
Fryer and Theodore de Laguna,!
University of California.
The judges were: James I). Phe- j
lan anil M. Frank Michael of San'
Francisco, and Colonel Charles 1!.
(i reenleaf of Berkeley. Professors
Lathrop and Boss ot Stanford and
Professors Bacon and Gayley of
the University of California const i-:
tuted the Committee of Arrange
ments. President Kellogg presided.
After the rules of the debate had
been read, Mr. Sheldon of Stanford
opened the debate for the aflirnia
tive. Mr. Sheldon bad good argu
ments, but their force was lessened
by the defects of bis diction and
use of language. Ii was noticeable
that the Berkeley men excelled our
men in delivery, stage presence,
and elocution. Mr. Sheldon showed
the advantages of a centralized
form of government. That cen
tralization was necessary fora
stable government. It suited the
characteristics of the French people.
The number of anarchists made it
necessary that the head of the gov
ernment should have the army at
bis immediate command. France
was surrounded by unfriendly
neighbors. Her movements must
be quid:. The centralized govern
ment enabled her to act with dis
patch in foreign affairs and to
carry out her sweeping foreign pol
icy consistently. lie mentioned
the suppression of Boulanger
through the power of the head of
the government.
C. E. Fryer of the U.C. followed
for the negative. Fryer has a very
line stasre appearance, and delivered
a smooth speech, though his style
is a little stiff and his delivery mo
notonous. 1 lis argument was not
well organized, lie held that cen
tralization was a menace to stable
government, and cited the danger
of the rise of a second Napoleon as
a fundamental objection. Ibis is
particularly liable to occur in a
state honeycombed, like France,
will) corrupt ion.
F. S. Howard of Stanford gave a
very good argument for the affirm
ative, although he spoke with in
sufficient force, and showed lack of
practice. Mr. Howard took the
practical side of the question, and
showed the practical advantages of
the present system, as shown by
the present stability of France. He
dwelt upon the fact that France
gained her sirenglh by centraliza
tion, and that she must have
strength to live. I le referred to the
good rule of the Chamber of Dep
uties.
10. I. Miller of Stanford, for the
negative, gave a well-organized ar
gument which showed thorough

study. I lis delivery did not have
enough animation. His argument
-was historical. His principal point
was that the government was not
protected from the ambition and
ability of a second Napoleon. If j
Napoleon could overturn the gov
ernment, why could not a second?
The temperament of the people, fa-j
voting changes, makes such a reac- j
tion possible. The present system I
is very susceptible to tyranny and I
change.
Theodore de Laguna of the U. C. >
for the negative had a good enunci
ation and delivered a finished
speech. He is a master of rhetori
cal effect although his arguments
are not pointed and his speech dif
fuse and bis figures rather extra
ordinary. His principal argument
was the evil effect of centralization
upon personal and civil liberty,
lie showed the effect of the control
of the provinces from Paris upon
local self-government.
M. C. Flaherty of the U. C. was
the last debater on the affirmative.
He is an easy and clear speaker,
stated his points very well, and his
speech was a remarkable combina
tion of good arguments and clear
presentation. He was character
ized by clearness rather than
strength, lie drew a distinction
between the Saxon and Latin races
that the Saxons were suited to
local self-government and that the
Latins to a centralized form. He
condemned the negative for applv-
I ing Saxon standards to Latin races.
He fortilied this statement with
; citations from the history of Eng
! land and France. He showed that
centralization was necessary to pre
serve the homogeneous character of
j French people.
Mr. Sheldon in his second speech
demolished the bugaboo of a social
Napoleon by analyzing the present
J character of the French people as
j compared to their former, and by
■ explaining the organization of the
j Chamber of Deputies. His second
argument was better than his first,
being characterized with more force
and point.
Mr. Flaherty also gave a very
good rebuttal. He contended that
: the present system is the only one
which served its purpose thus far,
! and that it could not be changed
I successfully owing to the nature of
the French people.
The other speakers marred the
i effect of their lirst efforts.
The judges then retired and thus
; classed the debaters: M. C.
Flaherty of the U. C. first ; 11. I).
Sheldon and E. I. Miller of Stan
ford second and third respectively.
Their decision was unanimous.
President Kellogg gave a dinner
after the debate to the speakers,
judges, and committee of arrange
ments.
