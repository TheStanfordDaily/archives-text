The action of the Inter-Society J
Debating League in holding open j
meetings of the four societies will I
probably result in reviving interest !
in debating and adding to the
membership of the societies the
most ambitious material. Just!
such meetings as those decided i
upon have long been needed. In - (
terest in the societies has been (.ly
ing out, and the most desirable men ;
in the upper classes have held aloof â– 
from the societies, owing probably I
tothe lack of a sutticent incentive to
make membership desirable. The
proposed com hi ned congress will fur-!
nish this incentive, and we may ex- j
pect the societies to be infused with
new life.
