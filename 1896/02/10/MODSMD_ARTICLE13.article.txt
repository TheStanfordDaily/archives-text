Our defeat in the Carnot content
was not at all unexpected. There
has been a culpable lack of inter
est in that important contest this
year. \\ hile some eight or ten ca
pable Berkeley men havts been
struggling for the honor of repre
senting their University in this im
portant event, there was not even
a preliminary contest here, and
places on the debate went begging.
At one time it seemed as though
Stanford would not be represented
at all. We have, as might have
been expected, met defeat as a re
sult of this policy.
There is another lesson in there
suit of this year's contest our need
of a department of elocution. The
speakers representing the Univer
sity of California were easy, grace
ful, and finished in style and de
livery. The arguments of the Stan
ford debaters were as forcible and
logical, but their delivery was, in
comparison with that of their op
ponents, unfinished and awkward.
It is true that the English de
partment has instituted a one-hour
course in elocution, but this course
is I>3' no means adequate. It isun
der an otherwise busy professor
who can give no time to individ
uals; it is limited in point of num
bers admitted, and its membership
confined to the upper classes.
Such a course can by no means
meet our present needs.
