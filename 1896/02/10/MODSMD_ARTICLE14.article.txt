Particular stress has already
been laid Upon the fact that the
track and baseball men must beex

eeptioiially diligent in training if
we are to keep up the unbroken
record in baseball and hold our own
on the field. There seems to be
little doubt that this can be done,
provided the proper training and j
support are given. The men them- j
selves are getting out early each j
afternoon, and are showing a spirit!
that leaves little to be desired.!
The student body, however, is not j
giving the men that encouragement
and enthusiasm which can be ob
tained only by the presence of a
large number of enthusiastic spec
tators on the field. We are all
deeply interested in the showing
that our athletes make, but it seems
never to occur to the majority that
the most effectual way of showing
our interest is to be present at the
track or baseball lield when the
men are training. There is no
greater incentive that can be given
the men than the enthusiasm of a
large crowd of fellow students.
Everyman, especially if he is a
traciv athlete, needs just this enthu
siasm to make him do his best.
The lack of it makes training a dull
thing, or tame at least in compar
ison to what it would be otherwise.
Its existence creates interest and
brings out latent talent. It will
thus be seen that the importance
of the support which the student
body can give can hardly be over
estimated. Let us all go out and
inspire the men with our enthu
siasm, and then we may safely
leave the results with the men
themselves.
