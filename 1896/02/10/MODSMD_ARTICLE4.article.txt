# Track and Field.
## 
### 
The full squad turned out for
practice Friday evening. The
track is still somewhat heavy, and
little jumping or pole-vaulting can
as yet be done. However, Toombs,
Dole, Brunton, and Whittier went
over the bar a few times in the high
jump.
The runners were given the usual
practice in starting and "jogging."
Several of the new men give consid
erable promise, though their form
is, without exception, poor.
Wilbur had the full squad of
weight men at work in the ring.
Dole is showing marked improve
ment in putting the shot, but the
jvisdom of putting Dole on the
weights is a matter of serious ques
tion. There is too strong a tend
ency to work good all-round men
like Dole and Brunton in too many
lines, instead of concentrating their
energies on the one or two events in
which they excel.
