# "THE BUBBLES OF SAKI."
## Sermon by David Starr Jordon. 
### 
Text: Job ii, 3: "The spirit of
God has made me and the breath
of the Almighty has given me life."
The thought of what 1 wish to
say is suggested by a verse in the
poem of Omar:
"The eternal Saki from her bowl
hath poured
Millions of bubbles like us and
will pour."
It is a curious feature of the hu
man mind that there is nothing
sweeter to it than philosophic or
poetic sorrow, the pain which is
purely intellectual. This pain has
been the basis of a great deal of the
poetry of the world. The subjects
of love, death, and infinity have
inspired nearly all our great poems.
In the poem of Omar which 1 read
you have a breath of this philoso
phy of sorrow. It, is the other side
of the feeling of grandeur. It is
not merely the shortness of human
life, the uncertainty as to whence it
comes and whither it goes, but there
is the feeling of grandeur that there
is some one who does know."The
eternal Saki from her bowl has
poured millions and will pour," im
plying the inexhaustible resources
of the infinite mind. If the mind
of man is a spark struck out from
the mind of the infinite, the
thought comes in, how great must
infinite mind be to strike out such
sparks! So there is a pleasant
side to the feeling of sadness ex
pressed in poetry of this kind —a
sweetness as of remembered kisses
after death.
W hat J wish to do is to point out
certain defects in the philosophy of
Omar's poem. Such philosophy is
not suitable as a basis for life. It
is something to be enjoyed, like a
strain of line music; it cannot
safely become a part of one's life;
sad music is not a guide to action.
It leads to inaction, death, to the
cup that "clears today of past re
grets and future tears." But when
we examine this cup we find that
the regrets and tears are all there.
They appear in different form, but
we are not rid of them.
The answer to this philosophy of
sadness might be put in these words
of Thoreau: ''There is no hope for
you so long as this bit of sod under
your feet is not sweeter to you than
any other in this world or in any
world." Here on this bit of sod the
grass grows greenest, the sicy is
bluest, the heaven highest. This
bit of sod under your feet is the
center of the universe to you.
Everything you know of love, of
heaven, or of God comes clearer to
you there than anywhere else.
Whatever may be the extent and
reach, the greatness or littleness of
other bubbles, you know that one
particular bubble exists as a part
of this universe and has a duty to
perform in it.
Viewed in this light the meanest
portion of time becomes important.
"The meanest day," as Carlyle said,
"is the cor flux of two eternities,"
—the eternity of yesterday and the
eternity of tomorrow. If you strike
out today, you strike out the center
of time and il collapses. Space
reaches out to infinity in all direc
tions. Its lines meet in you. If you
are stricken out, they can not meet.

It is the fact that there are
so many bubbles which makes
one seem insignificant. If there
were only a dozen men in
the world, each might think
himself of most importance. There
are so many great men that it takes
a century fora really great man to
rise above the mass. Everyman is
a man of importance if he does not
choose to compare himself to his
betters. Every man might be a.
god if he did not compare himself
with the infinite.
In the history of life the meanest
day has its place. Tennyson
speaks of the "dragons that tear
one another in the slime." These
dragons had their part to play. It
was to tear each other in the slime,
and however unpleasant the pic
ture may be, their part was neces
sary in bringing about the con
ditions of life as they now are.
Each meanest life is a part of the
life of eternity. Omar speaks of
the folly of the scheme of life be
ginning in nothing and ending in
nothing. "1 come like the water
and like the wind I go." It is often
suggested that the scheme might be
remodeled and improved. This
brings to mind the little girl in
Howell's story who wished every
day were Christmas. And so every
day became Christmas and brought
its wealth of gifts and pleasure.
Bye and bye this became distaste
ful, and the little girl wished that
Christinas did not come so often.
Were man permitted to mould the
scheme of life to his heart's desire,
he would not be able to better it.
He might make it better for him
self; but he is only a single word in
the great song of life.
It is a question then of truth, not
one of improving the scheme of life.
If we know what we are to do, we
may have a joyous and successful
life before us. Not the life an eter
nal Saki may have, but a life of
our own. W'e find that our own
will is one of the forces of the uni
verse. We find that wisdom is
simply knowing what to do next.
Not what was done when the foun
dations of the world were laid, but
what lies nearest us now. The only
time man has is today.
In Norwegian mythology there is
an old legend which tells how Odin,
sitting on his air throne, saw what
a bad piece of work men were mak
ing of life; how the giants, the
forces of nature, abused them; and
how the dwarfs, the petty weak
nesses of human nature, drove men
to do foolish things. He saw one of
the giants hurl a shepherd into the
sea, and putting his flock into his
pocket, go off cracking the sheep
like nuts between his jaws. He
asked for wisdom that he might un
derstand these things. Hut wisdom
had a price upon it. It cost him
his right eye. But he gave it, and
was taken through the mists of
Neffellieim, where he saw the yes
terday and the tomorrow of time,
the what was and the what was to
be.
Men like to look back and for
ward. But the ability to look into
the past and future brings sadness,
and men, like Omar, have wished
to put an end to this wisdom; to
strike out the dead past and un
born tomorrow. But to strike these
out whould be to put one's self back

where there was no wisdom, when
the dwarfs and giants played with
men.
But it is not the far away things
that concern men so much as the
near ones. Our lives exist in re
lation to tlie near tilings of the past
and future. Whittier has said:
"lie that wanders widest lifts
No more of beauty's jealous veil
Than he who from the doorway sees
The miracle of flowers and trees."
To see the wonders of life no mi
croscope or telescope is needed.
One can go out and see the dew
fall and how the plants respond to
its fall. Wisdom inaction paves its
own way. Every life governed by
action isstrongand helpful. The
man who so lives never stops to ask
whether life is worth living. It is
the man who destroys life by inac
tion who has time to discuss such
quest ions.
This wisdom of action tells how
to be happy, because it tells what
to do next. By being clean and
clear he can be happy, even though
he is only one in a procession of
bubbles.
1 met a young man recently who
said he quite agreed with Schopen
hauer that the only real thing in
life is pain. But it seems to me
that one who reaches this conclu
sion has no real idea what life is,
has never felt the force of reality.
All the pain I have ever had has
been but a minor consideration.
The football player, in going into
the game, does not worry over the
sore nose or the bruise he may get.
Bain, except in so far as it is a sign
of weakness, is a matter of minor
importance. I'ain is simply na
ture's signal that something
is wrong. But you would
not stop the train simply he
cause there was a scratch in the
paint on the engine. The state
ment that the only unreality in
life is pain, is quite as true as the
other.
Time is long and life is short.
God, as Emerson says, tosses hack
our failures; hut most of us have to
leave the failures to others to make
good. Each one of these failures,
however, paves the way for sell
realization, just as the dragons in
the slime prepared the way for
self-realization of lives made beau
tiful and sweet by unlikeness to
dragons.
1 have tried, in season and out
of season, to preach a doctrine that
may be expressed hy making a
slight change in the words of the
text which Rabbi Voorsanger
quoted from the ancient llabbis:
"Serve God, not as slaves hoping
for reward, but as gods who will
take no reward."
Every man has in him the same
life that is in the trees and plants
and lower animals. The proto
plasm must be fed. Each man
must feed his own hunger, or else
become a dead weight upon society.
No adjustment of civilization can
relieve him of the necessity of feed
ing this hunger of his protoplasm.
The better he feeds it the better it
will he for himself and for others.
What there is in life that is
worth living comes in over and
above the stilling of this primal
hunger. Art, religion, knowledge,
are their own reward; no one can
pay for them. "Not as slaves, hop

ing for reward, but as gods that
will take no reward." These make
up the spiritual world.
All we know of life is derived
from experience, either of ourselves
or of others. What we know of the
spiritual world is likewise a matter
of experience. The essence of
Christ's teaching is that this spir
itual world is the one in which we
now live. The spiritual world is
that part of our lives that is not
merely vegetative, that which we
do not for reward, hut knowing
that no reward can be given; what
the gods do, not as slaves or ser
vants.
Love is the ruling principle of
this world. This J have expressed
elsewhere in the phrase, ''Love is
Heaven's very atmosphere." It is
the only heaven we shall ever
know, for where love is not, can not
be heaven. Men are inclined t<»
think of the spiritual world as off
in the distance.
l'hilip asked fora sign, a spirit
ual vision. "Let us see the Father
and we shall be satisfied," he said.
But Christ answered, "Have I been
so long time with you, and yet hast
thou not known me, Philip?''
To illustrate the defect in Omar's
philosophy. Let us suppose this
poem of his to be perfect. It is
made up of many words and sen
tences, any one of which is insig
nificant in itself. It is a single
breath of a singer who can sing
many songs. Shall one of these
sentences despise itself because s»»
many go to make up the perfect
song? We might better say:
A humble note in an eternal song
The perfect singer hath made
place for me;
Not one in Life's long caravan
But shall he needful to Infinity.
Carmen Sylva has beautifully
expressed this in her Song of the
Hay, where she represents it as
saying:
'i bear away with me
The sunshine's dear remembrance,
and the low
Soft murmurs of the spring.
My breath is sweet as children's
prattle is ;
I drink in all the whole earth's
fruitfulness,
To make of it the fragrance of the
soul
That shall outlive my death.
Now to the morrow's flowers will 1
say:
'Dear children of my roots:
1 charge you, love the sun as J have
loved,
And love the lovers, and the little
birds,
That when ye bloom anew,
They never may remember I am
dead,
But always think they see the self
same flowers ;
Even as the sun that ever thinks
he sees
The self-same birds and lovers
upon earth,
Because he is immortal, and for this
Never remembers Death.'"

God has made me and the breath
of the Almighty has given me life."

No more of beauty's jealous veil
Than he who from the doorway sees
The miracle of flowers and trees."
To see the wonders of life no mi
croscope or telescope is needed.
One can go out and see the dew
fall and how the plants respond to
its fall. Wisdom inaction paves its
own way. Every life governed by
action isstrongand helpful. The
man who so lives never stops to ask
whether life is worth living. It is
the man who destroys life by inac
tion who has time to discuss such
quest ions.
This wisdom of action tells how
to be happy, because it tells what
to do next. By being clean and
clear he can be happy, even though
he is only one in a procession of
bubbles.
1 met a young man recently who
said he quite agreed with Schopen
hauer that the only real thing in
life is pain. But it seems to me
that one who reaches this conclu
sion has no real idea what life is,
has never felt the force of reality.
All the pain I have ever had has
been but a minor consideration.
The football player, in going into
the game, does not worry over the
sore nose or the bruise he may get.
Bain, except in so far as it is a sign
of weakness, is a matter of minor
importance. I'ain is simply na
ture's signal that something
is wrong. But you would
not stop the train simply he
cause there was a scratch in the
paint on the engine. The state
ment that the only unreality in
life is pain, is quite as true as the
other.
Time is long and life is short.
God, as Emerson says, tosses hack
our failures; hut most of us have to
leave the failures to others to make
good. Each one of these failures,
however, paves the way for sell
realization, just as the dragons in
the slime prepared the way for
self-realization of lives made beau
tiful and sweet by unlikeness to
dragons.
1 have tried, in season and out
of season, to preach a doctrine that
may be expressed hy making a
slight change in the words of the
text which Rabbi Voorsanger
quoted from the ancient llabbis:
"Serve God, not as slaves hoping
for reward, but as gods who will
take no reward."
Every man has in him the same
life that is in the trees and plants
and lower animals. The proto
plasm must be fed. Each man
must feed his own hunger, or else
become a dead weight upon society.
No adjustment of civilization can
relieve him of the necessity of feed
ing this hunger of his protoplasm.
The better he feeds it the better it
will he for himself and for others.
What there is in life that is
worth living comes in over and
above the stilling of this primal
hunger. Art, religion, knowledge,
are their own reward; no one can
pay for them. "Not as slaves, hop

ing for reward, but as gods that
will take no reward." These make
up the spiritual world.
All we know of life is derived
from experience, either of ourselves
or of others. What we know of the
spiritual world is likewise a matter
of experience. The essence of
Christ's teaching is that this spir
itual world is the one in which we
now live. The spiritual world is
that part of our lives that is not
merely vegetative, that which we
do not for reward, hut knowing
that no reward can be given; what
the gods do, not as slaves or ser
vants.
Love is the ruling principle of
this world. This J have expressed
elsewhere in the phrase, ''Love is
Heaven's very atmosphere." It is
the only heaven we shall ever
know, for where love is not, can not
be heaven. Men are inclined t<»
think of the spiritual world as off
in the distance.

To illustrate the defect in Omar's
philosophy. Let us suppose this
poem of his to be perfect. It is
made up of many words and sen
tences, any one of which is insig
nificant in itself. It is a single
breath of a singer who can sing
many songs. Shall one of these
sentences despise itself because s»»
many go to make up the perfect
song? We might better say:
A humble note in an eternal song
The perfect singer hath made
place for me;
Not one in Life's long caravan
But shall he needful to Infinity.
Carmen Sylva has beautifully
expressed this in her Song of the
Hay, where she represents it as
saying:
'i bear away with me
The sunshine's dear remembrance,
and the low
Soft murmurs of the spring.
My breath is sweet as children's
prattle is ;
I drink in all the whole earth's
fruitfulness,
To make of it the fragrance of the
soul
That shall outlive my death.
Now to the morrow's flowers will 1
say:
'Dear children of my roots:
1 charge you, love the sun as J have
loved,
And love the lovers, and the little
birds,
That when ye bloom anew,
They never may remember I am
dead,
But always think they see the self
same flowers ;
Even as the sun that ever thinks
he sees
The self-same birds and lovers
upon earth,
Because he is immortal, and for this
Never remembers Death.'"
Text: Job ii, 3: "The spirit of
God has made me and the breath
of the Almighty has given me life."
The thought of what 1 wish to
say is suggested by a verse in the
poem of Omar:
"The eternal Saki from her bowl
hath poured
Millions of bubbles like us and
will pour."
It is a curious feature of the hu
man mind that there is nothing
sweeter to it than philosophic or
poetic sorrow, the pain which is
purely intellectual. This pain has
been the basis of a great deal of the
poetry of the world. The subjects
of love, death, and infinity have
inspired nearly all our great poems.
In the poem of Omar which 1 read
you have a breath of this philoso
phy of sorrow. It, is the other side
of the feeling of grandeur. It is
not merely the shortness of human
life, the uncertainty as to whence it
comes and whither it goes, but there
is the feeling of grandeur that there
is some one who does know."The
eternal Saki from her bowl has
poured millions and will pour," im
plying the inexhaustible resources
of the infinite mind. If the mind
of man is a spark struck out from
the mind of the infinite, the
thought comes in, how great must
infinite mind be to strike out such
sparks! So there is a pleasant
side to the feeling of sadness ex
pressed in poetry of this kind —a
sweetness as of remembered kisses
after death.
W hat J wish to do is to point out
certain defects in the philosophy of
Omar's poem. Such philosophy is
not suitable as a basis for life. It
is something to be enjoyed, like a
strain of line music; it cannot
safely become a part of one's life;
sad music is not a guide to action.
It leads to inaction, death, to the
cup that "clears today of past re
grets and future tears." But when
we examine this cup we find that
the regrets and tears are all there.
They appear in different form, but
we are not rid of them.
The answer to this philosophy of
sadness might be put in these words
of Thoreau: ''There is no hope for
you so long as this bit of sod under
your feet is not sweeter to you than
any other in this world or in any
world." Here on this bit of sod the
grass grows greenest, the sicy is
bluest, the heaven highest. This
bit of sod under your feet is the
center of the universe to you.
Everything you know of love, of
heaven, or of God comes clearer to
you there than anywhere else.
Whatever may be the extent and
reach, the greatness or littleness of
other bubbles, you know that one
particular bubble exists as a part
of this universe and has a duty to
perform in it.
Viewed in this light the meanest
portion of time becomes important.
"The meanest day," as Carlyle said,
"is the cor flux of two eternities,"
—the eternity of yesterday and the
eternity of tomorrow. If you strike
out today, you strike out the center
of time and il collapses. Space
reaches out to infinity in all direc
tions. Its lines meet in you. If you
are stricken out, they can not meet.

It is the fact that there are
so many bubbles which makes
one seem insignificant. If there
were only a dozen men in
the world, each might think
himself of most importance. There
are so many great men that it takes
a century fora really great man to
rise above the mass. Everyman is
a man of importance if he does not
choose to compare himself to his
betters. Every man might be a.
god if he did not compare himself
with the infinite.
In the history of life the meanest
day has its place. Tennyson
speaks of the "dragons that tear
one another in the slime." These
dragons had their part to play. It
was to tear each other in the slime,
and however unpleasant the pic
ture may be, their part was neces
sary in bringing about the con
ditions of life as they now are.
Each meanest life is a part of the
life of eternity. Omar speaks of
the folly of the scheme of life be
ginning in nothing and ending in
nothing. "1 come like the water
and like the wind I go." It is often
suggested that the scheme might be
remodeled and improved. This
brings to mind the little girl in
Howell's story who wished every
day were Christmas. And so every
day became Christmas and brought
its wealth of gifts and pleasure.
Bye and bye this became distaste
ful, and the little girl wished that
Christinas did not come so often.
Were man permitted to mould the
scheme of life to his heart's desire,
he would not be able to better it.
He might make it better for him
self; but he is only a single word in
the great song of life.
It is a question then of truth, not
one of improving the scheme of life.
If we know what we are to do, we
may have a joyous and successful
life before us. Not the life an eter
nal Saki may have, but a life of
our own. W'e find that our own
will is one of the forces of the uni
verse. We find that wisdom is
simply knowing what to do next.
Not what was done when the foun
dations of the world were laid, but
what lies nearest us now. The only
time man has is today.
In Norwegian mythology there is
an old legend which tells how Odin,
sitting on his air throne, saw what
a bad piece of work men were mak
ing of life; how the giants, the
forces of nature, abused them; and
how the dwarfs, the petty weak
nesses of human nature, drove men
to do foolish things. He saw one of
the giants hurl a shepherd into the
sea, and putting his flock into his
pocket, go off cracking the sheep
like nuts between his jaws. He
asked for wisdom that he might un
derstand these things. Hut wisdom
had a price upon it. It cost him
his right eye. But he gave it, and
was taken through the mists of
Neffellieim, where he saw the yes
terday and the tomorrow of time,
the what was and the what was to
be.
Men like to look back and for
ward. But the ability to look into
the past and future brings sadness,
and men, like Omar, have wished
to put an end to this wisdom; to
strike out the dead past and un
born tomorrow. But to strike these
out whould be to put one's self back

where there was no wisdom, when
the dwarfs and giants played with
men.
But it is not the far away things
that concern men so much as the
near ones. Our lives exist in re
lation to tlie near tilings of the past
and future. Whittier has said:
"lie that wanders widest lifts
No more of beauty's jealous veil
Than he who from the doorway sees
The miracle of flowers and trees."
To see the wonders of life no mi
croscope or telescope is needed.
One can go out and see the dew
fall and how the plants respond to
its fall. Wisdom inaction paves its

to be happy, because it tells what
to do next. By being clean and
clear he can be happy, even though
he is only one in a procession of
