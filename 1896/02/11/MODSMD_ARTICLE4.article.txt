It is ;i notorious fact that the li-!
hrary hooks are being marked and
mutilated in an outrageous manner. '
Whether this is done by freshmen;
or by old students, it is equally
reprehensible, l! is not uncommon J
to fin(i ;i rare old copy with careless I

the opinion of the student who 1111-1
derscores brilliant passages is much
to be desired. The authorities
ought to hire such a competent ft-1 -
low to go over the whole library
and mark off the valuable sayings;
then there would not be three kinds
of ink, or pencils in live degrees of
blackness, as at present used in
this gratuitous work.
The markings in some books
seem to be the work of six-year-olds.
In certain books on the course in!
the French Revolution scarcely a
I age is free from pencil marks; and
one of the professors who kindly
opens his valuable private library
to the use of students has had books
returned covered with mud and \
otherwise defaced.
Onk of the unique developments
of the last quarter-century in Amer
ica is the wealthy university. Many
instances of the tendency for ini-j
mense sums of money to be set
apart for higher education have;
come before the public, within a few
years. The founding of Stanford
and Chicago, and the liberal en
dowment of Columbia by its presi
dent, lion. Seth Low, readily occur
t;> one in this connection. But uni
versity education is not, in America,
dependent solely upon the gener
osity of individuals. The wise
movement begun by Thomas Jeffer
son, in Virginia, has gone steadily
forward, and today the majority of
the state universities are supported
with no niggard hand by the legis-
The movement scarcely finds a
parallel in history, except it be in
the establishment of the monnster
ies throughout 10urope during the
Middle Ages. There the motive
was religious. I'ietv induced the
wealthy to convey their gold and
land? to the clerical orders; the
feeling that religion and govern
ment were inseparably bound

together led the state to afford pro
tection and fostering care to spirit
ual corporations, during a long
period. Today piety lias given way
to the all-pervading worship of
knowledge; and the supposed con
nection between spiritual ami po
litical functions, to an equally
strong conviction that education is
one of the tirst cares of government.
After all, the change of attitude is
insignificant, and the parallel we
have indicated most striking.
The question naturally arises, Is
the day likely to come when the
universities, like the monasteries,
will he deprived of the state's pro
tection, and in fact subject to hos
tile legislation? So soon as the
clerical orders waxed too strong
and wealthy, statutes of mortmain
began to appear. Signs are not
wanting that a spirit of opposition
against the sequestration of such
immense sums for university pur
poses is slowly springing up in
some quarters. We believe the an
swer to the problem may be found
in a recent paradoxical utterance of
President Angell of Michigan Uni
versity. 1 >r. Angell said that a
university, if it does its duty, is al
ways poor. Ky these words he
meant that a university, in order
to keep itself abreast of the times,
must constantly live up to the limit
of its finances. Only when the
monastic orders became worldly
and selfish were they attacked.
Only when our modern universities
fail to do their duty with the en
dowments trusted to them will they
be in serious danger from public
opinion, ami not before.
