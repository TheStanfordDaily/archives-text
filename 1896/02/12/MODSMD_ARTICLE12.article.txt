It is generally supposed that
students in a university have
passed through babyhood, audit is
taken for granted that they have
put aside intanti.e habits along
with rattles iind teething-rings It
is also commonly believed that col
lege men are men of judgment and
understanding.
In certain instance, sthese pre
vailing ideas seem to beat variance
with fact. The majority of uni
versity students have indeed put
away childish things and estab
lished a reputation for common
sense and self-possession, and ii is
well for us that the actions of this
majority have been accepted as

evidence of general good-breeding.
On the other hand, we can not deny
that a few persons now and then
take refuge among us whose ideas
of propriety are very meagre, and
that these would bring us, as stu
dents, somewhat into disrepute
were it not for the watchful eye of
the Faculty which quickly weeds
out such material when once dis
covered.
There is apparently a need of fur
ther weeding along this line. The
treatment which a party of refined
Eastern tourists received while
driving past Enema recently, is
but an all too common occur
rence. Hoots, jeers, and imperti
nent remarks from certain win
dows which too often greet visitors,
send them away justly indignant at
such insult and with a very poor
opinion of Stanford University.
Easterners who have a 1 ingering sus
picion anyhow that Californians
are boors will be wholly convinced
that such suspicions are well
grounded when such manners as
these are found in a university here.
There are also certain hoarders
at Encina who are guilty of making
it very undesirable for ladies to
pass within hearing distance of the
Hall.
These are lamentable facts to be
spoken of in a college paper, but
they are facts nevertheless, and the
quicker these evils are wiped out
the better for all concerned. The
more satisfactory way would be for
the culprits to reform at once.
Failing to do this, measures should
be taken to eradicate this element
with as little delay as possible.
