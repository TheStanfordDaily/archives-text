### 
Two new candidates appeared at
last night's practice —Whipple, '98.
and Lawrence,' 99. Whipple conies
from the University of the Pacific.
He pitched for the U. I'. nine when
their team played our freshmen
two years ago. He will be given
an opportunity to show his ability
in the box.
The infield work has not been up
to the standard of late. Taylor at
short-stop is not playing his game.
I n Saturday's game several ground
ers got through liini, and several
wild throws to first were credited
against him. Sharp at third also
needs to brace up.
There is not much improvement
as yet in the outfield. This is es
pecially shown in the judgment of
short Hies. The fielder generally
waits too long before running up,
and allows the ball to bound before
he gets to it.
The practice game last evening
was discouraging. Muffs were the
rule, and good plays the exception.
Neither pitcher showed much
ability, and both need a great deal
of practice. Heavy batting was
the principal feature of the game.
