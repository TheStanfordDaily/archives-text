# What Can be Done for the Farmer?
## 
### 
The chemist rj* lecture room was
well filled Tuesday afternoon l>y
the students and professors who
wished to hear the discussion of the
Lubin proposition between Mr.
Lubin himself on the allinnative,
and Messrs. Ross and Cathcart on
the negative.
Before the beginning of the dis
cussion, Prof. Ross introduced Mr.
(irter, head of the State Grange of
California, who said that the de
pressed condition of agriculture
made the farmers of the State
think that there should be some ad
justment of the laws for the benefit
of the agricultural interests, and
that the organization which lie
represented was inclined to believe
in Mr. Lubin's proposition for such
adjustment.
Prof, Ross then stated the con
ditions of the debate, and intro
duced Mr. Lubin, who, in his open
ing speech, merely emphasized the
fact that the question was based on
the assumption that the United
States would, for a considerable
period, continue its present protec
tive policy.
Mr. lioss declared that, to prove
the affirmative of the question, it
was necessary to prove, first, that
an export bounty would be a just
and expedient compensation. He
held that the depressed condition of
agriculture was much overstated,
when compared with the fall of
prices in other lines, and that the
influence of the tariff was grossly
exaggerated. Payment of a bounty
would tend to create a. dependent
class of industry, would discourage
diversified production, and would
defeat its own object by bringing
up money prices of all classes.
Mr. Lubin in answer said that
an}' argument as to the depressed
condition of agriculture had noth
ing to do with the question. The
farmer's wheat must lie sold at the
world's price, but he can only buy
manufactures at protection prices.
If the government can be called
upon to raise the price of manufac
ures, the same relief should be open
to agricultural products.
Mr. Cat heart then argued for the
negative. He held that if a bounty
were offered the increased amount
of exports would cause the export
price to fall, thus preventing the
farmers from realizing any benefit:
a comparison of prices from 1S70-
V>1 shows thai farmers have been
more fortunate in this regard than
any other class of producers.
Farmers are not at a di: advantage
as regards the tariff with ihe great
majority of the people, yet all
would have to help | ay the bounty.
In his closing speech Mr. Lubin
declared that a careful study
would show that the farmers who
are the conservators of the republic
are the only class which does not
receive any benefit from protection.
The chapel was comfortably filled
Tuesday evening to hear the dis
cussion of the Lubin proposition,
participated in by Professors Ross
and Powers and Mr. David Lubin
himself. The discussion was un
bearably long, but was at times
spicy and bristling with repartee.
Mr. YV. \V. (Jreer, Master of the
State Grange, was first introduced,
and gave the position of the farm-

ers of the State in regard to the
plan proposed. The farmers are
greatly interested in this question;
they believe that something must
lie done to give the farmers the
same share of protection as is given
to the manufacturing interests. If
any weakness can he shown to ex
ist in the plan, the sooner it can be
shown to the farmers the better it
will be.
Prof. E. A. Ross was then intro
duced and he spoke in support of
the plan on the ground that though
protection may be a bad thing and
the bounty be a bad thing, yet if
we take the two together they will
both be better than either one
alone. They say that a protective
tariff protects American labor; the
agriculturists are laborers as much
as the manufacturers, hence are en
titled to the same protection. All
the arguments in favor of a protec
tive tariff can be applied with
equal facility to the bounty system.
The tariff tends to spread out to all
classes, but not to the agricultural
class in the same degree as the oth
ers. Hence it is intended by this
plan to extend the protective prin
ciple so as to include the bounty
principle.
Prof. 11. 11. Powers spoke next,
and before proceeding to attack tlie
plan, outlined the terms upon
which the discussion was to be con
ducted. The condition was that
the protective system was to he
continued as at present, but he was
not willing to concede that this
system should be continued by the
government without good reason
for so doing. There is a great deal
assumed in the term ''protection to
[American industries." There is no
such thing as protection to indus
tries, except to certain particular
industries. When we started this
country there was but one industry
in operation and that was agricul
ture; and it was believed by Alex
ander Hamilton that it was not
suitable for the country to be
specialized in one industry in this
manner. This is why the protec
tive principle was adopted; but the
country never talked about protect
ing the industries of the United
States, but to protect those indus
tries which did not at the time ex
ist.
Protection acts just this way: we
will take from our strong industries
and protect those which are weak.
There is no way under heaven
given among men by which you
can protect industries in any other
way.
Again, it is absolutely essential
that nations which export must
also import. If we send our pro
duets to Europe, there is but one
thing for us to do and that is to
import something in return; it may
not be done directly, but it will be
done in effect. If we simply want
to protect those that are weak at
the expense of those that are strong,
then we can do it only in the man
ner proposed; but how will it be
done? Simply by protecting them
all—and this leaves us just where
we were at first. And this double
protection is no protection at all;
it simply leaves a double burden
on the la boring classes. Is it worth
while to employ a man in taking
his money from one pocket and
putting it into the other?

There is an open question as to
whether there is a need for any
such measure as this. Is there
such great depression among the
farming class as has been sug
gested ?
The further question is whether
this proposition would bring any
such relief. The increased amount
of agricultural products thrown
upon the market will simply re
duce the price which the world
would otherwise pay for those pro
ducts. Representing the one hun
dred per cent, of those who eat
breadstuff's, 1 protest against this
enhancement of the price which 1
have to pay.
Mr. David Lubin was then intro
duced as a model of what an
agitator should do in taking up the
work in a serious manner. In
answer to the attacks of Professor
Powers, Mr. Lubin stated that the
time had long ago passed when it
was necessary to take from the
strong industries to give to the
weak. The tariff is a good thing to
catch one way, but it. will not
catch those which go theother way;
this is what the bounty is intended
to do. It was extremely diiiicult
to follow Mr. Lubin's arguments, as
it consisted almost wholly of figures
with a considerable admixture of
llie hackneyed expressions common
to the average tariff supporter. He
stated that the measure wherever
it came before the people had a
majority against it, and whenever
it had been put to a vote after dis
cussion there were very few votes
cast against it. It is attracting the
attention of the farmers and several
states have taken it up. The
speaker disclaimed the authorship
of the measure, saying that it had
been in use in England many years
ago.

that the organization which lie
represented was inclined to believe
in Mr. Lubin's proposition for such
adjustment.
Prof, Ross then stated the con
ditions of the debate, and intro
duced Mr. Lubin, who, in his open
ing speech, merely emphasized the
fact that the question was based on
the assumption that the United
States would, for a considerable
period, continue its present protec
tive policy.
Mr. lioss declared that, to prove
the affirmative of the question, it
was necessary to prove, first, that
an export bounty would be a just
and expedient compensation. He
held that the depressed condition of
agriculture was much overstated,
when compared with the fall of
prices in other lines, and that the
influence of the tariff was grossly
exaggerated. Payment of a bounty
would tend to create a. dependent
class of industry, would discourage
diversified production, and would
defeat its own object by bringing
up money prices of all classes.
Mr. Lubin in answer said that
an}' argument as to the depressed
condition of agriculture had noth
ing to do with the question. The
farmer's wheat must lie sold at the
world's price, but he can only buy
manufactures at protection prices.
If the government can be called
upon to raise the price of manufac
ures, the same relief should be open
to agricultural products.
Mr. Cat heart then argued for the
negative. He held that if a bounty
were offered the increased amount
of exports would cause the export
price to fall, thus preventing the
farmers from realizing any benefit:
a comparison of prices from 1S70-
V>1 shows thai farmers have been
more fortunate in this regard than
any other class of producers.
Farmers are not at a di: advantage
as regards the tariff with ihe great
majority of the people, yet all
would have to help | ay the bounty.
In his closing speech Mr. Lubin
declared that a careful study
would show that the farmers who
are the conservators of the republic
are the only class which does not
receive any benefit from protection.
The chapel was comfortably filled
Tuesday evening to hear the dis
cussion of the Lubin proposition,
participated in by Professors Ross
and Powers and Mr. David Lubin
himself. The discussion was un
bearably long, but was at times
spicy and bristling with repartee.
Mr. YV. \V. (Jreer, Master of the
State Grange, was first introduced,
and gave the position of the farm-

ers of the State in regard to the
plan proposed. The farmers are
greatly interested in this question;
they believe that something must
lie done to give the farmers the
same share of protection as is given
to the manufacturing interests. If
any weakness can he shown to ex
ist in the plan, the sooner it can be
shown to the farmers the better it
will be.
Prof. E. A. Ross was then intro
duced and he spoke in support of
the plan on the ground that though
protection may be a bad thing and
the bounty be a bad thing, yet if
we take the two together they will
both be better than either one
alone. They say that a protective
tariff protects American labor; the
agriculturists are laborers as much
as the manufacturers, hence are en
titled to the same protection. All
the arguments in favor of a protec
tive tariff can be applied with
equal facility to the bounty system.
The tariff tends to spread out to all
classes, but not to the agricultural
class in the same degree as the oth
ers. Hence it is intended by this
plan to extend the protective prin
ciple so as to include the bounty
principle.
Prof. 11. 11. Powers spoke next,
and before proceeding to attack tlie
plan, outlined the terms upon
which the discussion was to be con
ducted. The condition was that
the protective system was to he
continued as at present, but he was
not willing to concede that this
system should be continued by the
government without good reason
for so doing. There is a great deal
assumed in the term ''protection to
[American industries." There is no
such thing as protection to indus
tries, except to certain particular
industries. When we started this
country there was but one industry
in operation and that was agricul
ture; and it was believed by Alex
ander Hamilton that it was not
suitable for the country to be
specialized in one industry in this
manner. This is why the protec
tive principle was adopted; but the
country never talked about protect
ing the industries of the United
States, but to protect those indus
tries which did not at the time ex
ist.
Protection acts just this way: we
will take from our strong industries
and protect those which are weak.
There is no way under heaven
given among men by which you
can protect industries in any other
way.
Again, it is absolutely essential
that nations which export must
also import. If we send our pro
duets to Europe, there is but one
thing for us to do and that is to
import something in return; it may
not be done directly, but it will be
done in effect. If we simply want
to protect those that are weak at
the expense of those that are strong,
then we can do it only in the man
ner proposed; but how will it be
done? Simply by protecting them
all—and this leaves us just where
we were at first. And this double
protection is no protection at all;
it simply leaves a double burden
on the la boring classes. Is it worth
while to employ a man in taking
his money from one pocket and
putting it into the other?

There is an open question as to
whether there is a need for any
such measure as this. Is there
such great depression among the
farming class as has been sug
gested ?
The further question is whether
this proposition would bring any
such relief. The increased amount
of agricultural products thrown
upon the market will simply re
duce the price which the world
would otherwise pay for those pro
ducts. Representing the one hun
dred per cent, of those who eat
breadstuff's, 1 protest against this
enhancement of the price which 1
have to pay.
Mr. David Lubin was then intro
duced as a model of what an
agitator should do in taking up the
work in a serious manner. In
answer to the attacks of Professor
Powers, Mr. Lubin stated that the
time had long ago passed when it
was necessary to take from the
strong industries to give to the
weak. The tariff is a good thing to
catch one way, but it. will not
catch those which go theother way;
this is what the bounty is intended
to do. It was extremely diiiicult
to follow Mr. Lubin's arguments, as
it consisted almost wholly of figures
with a considerable admixture of
llie hackneyed expressions common
to the average tariff supporter. He
stated that the measure wherever
it came before the people had a
majority against it, and whenever
it had been put to a vote after dis
cussion there were very few votes
cast against it. It is attracting the
attention of the farmers and several
states have taken it up. The
speaker disclaimed the authorship
of the measure, saying that it had
been in use in England many years
ago.
