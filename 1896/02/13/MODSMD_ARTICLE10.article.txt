life of the student as an endless

live among honks are never hurried,

harassing hustle and hustle of the
great world of action; of necessity

ment. Hut there is a sense in
which the student —at any rate the
modern student -is not on a much
better footing with respect to leis
ure and opportunity for enjoyment
and repose than the man of the

man knowledge becoming, com
pared with what it once was, that
the student of today is forced to
dip into an ever-lengthening cata
logue of subjects without time to
meditate and digest a single one as
he would wish to do. We venture

dents in any university of the pres
ent day fail to enjoy their work as
it might he enjoyed because they
are compelled to go at a break-neck
rate all the time, and must jump
from subject to subject, book to
book, without ever being able to
sit down and realize adequately
what it all means. No one is to

books somewhat indifferently.
