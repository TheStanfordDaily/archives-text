Isn'i it ahout time that the
Berkeley ()ce'nln\f should get some
rational and unprejudiced person
to write up the articles concerning
track athletics? The good feeling
displayed this year hy the papers
of our rival university has heen fre
quently commented on in these
columns. The individual who
writes this series of articles has of
fered the only exception. Not a
week has passed hut he h;is intro

duced Home h1 ij>liti nreference re
garding our athletes.
I lis latest effusion is an attempt
at sarcasm concerning a Stanford
estimate of some of our track ath
letes. The Sequoia article in ques
tion mentioned four of our promi
nent athletes as being "expected to
win first places" in the coming
field-day. There was no dispar
agement of Berkeley athletes in all
this; it was simply a calculation
bjised upon the fact that each of
the men in question has once de
feated his most prominent opponent
from the University of California.
How much right the brilliant
freshman journalist in question
lias to criticize Stanford's over-con
fidence may be estimated by com
paring his latest with the former
effort, presumably by the same au
thor, wherein the Occident, gave
vent to its misdirected enthusiasm.
That article has already been
quoted in this paper. It is unnec
essary to repeat at length the
enumeration given of the number
of athletes at U. C. who can, accord
ing to our freshman friend, "run
away" from Stanford's fleetest men.
The mere mention of this article
and of its assuming and arrogant
tone is enough to show the incon
sistency of Berkeley's prize journal
ist in the athletic line. It is to be
hoped that before the next inter
collegiate field-day the writer in
question may have solicitous
friends to put him aboard the right
train.
