# AILMENTS OF THE NOSE.
## Last Evening's Lecture by Dr. Jordan. 
### 
1 have been asked by different
students at different times to give
:i practical lecture on the subject
of the nose. My litness for this
distinction lies mainly in the fact
that I have a large nose and have
had it longer than almost any one
else around here, so we have become
somewhat acquainted with each
other.
The nose originally was con
structed for the purpose of smell
only. In the fish is a hollow sack,
connected with which is the olfac
tory nerve. This sack has two
openings, so when the fish swims
through the water it will go in at
one opening and out at the other.
The air going to the lungs to be
used in breathing passes by the ol
factory nerves, and as ;i result the
nose is a complicated organ, and
the new parts have not become
very well fitted for the conditions
in life. The lishes swim with
mouths kept closing and opening
so a current of water passes back
ward through the gills.
In animals the nostrils are used
for the purpose of respiration. The
nose is lined With mucous mem
brane, which membrane gives out
a secretion keeping the surface
moist. In the natural condition it
would secrete just enough fluid to
keep it healthy. That is to say, the
nose is not perfectly adjusted to the
surroundings. That is especially
true in northern climes, where the
mucous membrane is subjected to
more changes of atmosphere.
The nose serves the general pur
pose of giving us warning as to the
kind of air we breathe. The little
hairs in the nose serve the purpose
of straining the atmosphere to some
extent, shutting out particles of
dust, etc. The passages in the nose
being moist tend to make the air
moist and warm, and much better
for breathing. The same mem
brane extends from the nose down
ward into the throat, and the same
diseases in one way or another
may extend from the nose into the
throat and thence to the ear.
Many diseases of the ear have
their origin in the mucous mem
brane congestion. The little blood
vessels in the mucous membrane
become swollen and clotted with
blood. The blood Hows slowly
through and becomes congested.
This will be caused by sudden cool
ing of some portion of the body, as
of the feet or hands. The dilat
ing of the nose arteries causes an
abnormal flow of blood to the little
blood vessels and the mucous mem
brane becomes clogged and so the
nose gets tilled up and some times
inflammation sets in. Or ihe
nose may be without any secre
tion at all. This we ordinarily
know by the name of cold or ca
tarrh. In the nose of the lower
animals, it was intended to be a
structure for the pur| ose of smell
ing, and so there were reasons why
it is not subject to very great
sensitiveness in othc r ways.
A very considerable inflamma
tion may exist in the membrane of
the nose without pain, and one
danger of the disease is that it is
often painless.
A healthy person does not breathe

through the mouth, and when one
dot's it is an indication that the in
flammation is comparatively seri
ous. So also of snoring.
Some forms of sore eyes are con
nected with trouble of the nose in
the same way.
There is no such tiling as hered
itary nasal troubles or catarrh, any
more than there is hereditary con
sumption ; only in some people the
membranes are weaker than others.
Hereditary traits can be avoided
by carefully avoiding the cause.
Wetting one's feet is one great
source of colds, and standing at
the door on a cold night bidding
some one goodbye ; wearing shoes
too thin ; going from very warm
room into cold one. Very often
the things taken to relieve are in
the end extremely injurious. The
odor of ammonia or camphor and
other sharp, stimulating sub
stances act on the membranes and
thicken them. Almost anything
with pungent odor has a tendency
to irritate. Another bad thing is
the smoking of tobacco. Its effect
is most injurious on the linings of
the nostrils.
It is bad to wash the nose out
with water, for it thickens the
membranes. Salt and water is
often prescribed. The salt will not
irritate the nose but anything in
water tends to thicken the tissues.
In many cases where there is a
growth in the nose or throat it is
best removed by surgery. A good
simple remedy is melted vaseline;
snuff it or rub on the outside of
the nose.
But don't use patent medicines.
