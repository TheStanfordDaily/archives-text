As matters stand now, it seems
that the straining of athletic rela
tions between Vale and Harvard
is to result in unlimited good.
Last fall, for example, conditions
growing directly out of this state of
affairs brought about a much wider
extension of the game of football
than was ever possible under the
old conditions. Now it seems likely
that Vale will enter the Henley re
gatta and make an attempt to wipe
out the memory of last year's fiasco.
It is unfortunate that o.d friends
and old rivals like Vale and Har
vard should be at outs, but ama
teur sport in general has been
greatly benefited by the changed
situation.
