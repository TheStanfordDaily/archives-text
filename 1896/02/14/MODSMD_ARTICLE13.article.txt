The idea of the baseball man
agement for the raising of necessary
funds seemed to have sunk into ob
livion after the failure of the plan
fora dance in Encina gymnasium.
That idea has now been revived and
there is every prospect that in its
new form, when once it is in oper
ation, it will keep the exchequer
sufficiently well filled. The new
plan is to charge admission to the
inter-class matches which are soon
to take place. This will give a
chance to every student to prove
his class loyalty and will, at the
same time, assist our baseball in
terests. Little can be done by the
team until there is sufficient money
to properly equip the men. It
might be a sagacious financial
scheme for the management to
bring about a rush between the un
der-elassinen on the day of one of
these games, as was done two years
ago, for the amusement of the co
eds and upper-classmen. This
could be properly advertised and
would make a good drawing card.

There seems to be a tendency to
give i)j) the enjoyable (?) old cus
tomary rush. Doubtless all classes
have had the same inclination to
avoid these class conflicts, but the
upper-classmen who participate in
the struggle (as spectators) have
been energetic in keeping up the
custom. Have they decided to al
low it to sink from sight, or have
the laws of evolution accomplished
such a transformation in the make
up of the freshman that he can no
longer be made an instrument for
the pleasure of the officious junior
or senior?
