# The
						Great Love of God.

### 
Rev. John E. Bushnell, pastor of
the First English Lutheran Church
of Oakland, spoke in the chapel
Sunday on "The Great Love of
God." Mr. Bushnell chose for his
text I John, iii, 1: "Behold, what
manner of love the Father hath be
stowed upon us, that we should be
called the sons of God." His re
marks follow:
In the new version of the Scrip
tures the text quoted is followed by
these words, "and such are we."
It is a question whether this state
ment should appear or whether it
is simply an addition.
1 take it that we might today
read the same text in that book of
Nature which many of you study
more closely, no doubt, than those
of us who spend our time in the
study of this written Word. But
that book of Nature to many who
seem to understand this word is as
though it were written in a foreign
tongue. In this Book what would
otherwise be as Greek has been put
in commonplace language, that all
might understand it.
In your private lives, too, I have
no doubt this text can be read.
I thought perhaps you might take
me to the various home circles
represented here this morning. I
feel that we are strangers. 1 feel
that your private life is a closed
volume to me. Still if you should
take me to your home, perhaps 1
could not at lirst put rny finger on
a text; yet if 1 could see you greet
father, mother, someone whom you
loved, prehaps above everything
else it would lead me to say ''Be
hold, what manner of love."
So, too, in our social instincts.
The spirit of Altruism, of man's
love for man, grows daily; until we
can truly say within the words of
the founder of this University that
"The beneficence of the Creator
towards man on earth, and the
possibilities of Humanity, are one
and the same." Man's love for his
neighbor, and the love that our
good Father God cherishes for us,
is one and the same.
And yet as we seek to understand
how God loves us as his dear chil
dren. perhaps we do not always
find ourselves brought to realize
the length and breadth, the infinity
of the love of God. The ordinary
expression of our love towards one
another does not compare with it.
When Garfield, trained and devel
oped by bis mother, stood before
the representatives of the civilized
world and took the oath of oflice,
and t hen without affectation turned
reverently to his aged mother and
embraced her, that all might recog
nize what he owed to his mother,
it was but a natural and ordinary
expression of love. But the love of
God, who can measure it. if this
was but the ordinary manifestation
of man's love?
There are conditions and circum
stances in which we seem to see de
velopments that enable us to real
ize more fully how there is a
divinity—something in our ordi
nary experience of life that enables
us to fathom, to a certain extent,
the infiniteness of God's love. 1
passed a man the other day as he
stood in the door of his store. He
looked sober and sad, as if business
interests were going against him.

I passed a word with him, and lie:
must have caught some tone of;
sympathy in my works, for when a ;
little later in the day 1 passed thatl
way on my wheel, he beckoned me
to stop, and taking me into his
store was soon unfolding to me his
story. His wife was dead —died of
a broken heart, as it proved. A
son, (lie brightest of tlie children,
had been dragged down by vicious
companions, until fom shame he
had left the parental roof. For
fourteen years he had been gone,
and for ten years of that time they
had not so much as a word from
him. 'Fhe mother had died from
grief. "And now," said the father,
'"lie writes only for money —some-
thing to buy him drink, lie writes
for live dollars, I send him ten; he
writes for twenty-five, 1 send him
fifty. In every letter I beg him to!
come and comfort me, but he will ;
not come. O, would that he could !
know how much I wish for his re- j
turn!" Such love as this father i
showed I think helps us to under-1
stand the love of God. And these!
stories are not uncommon. Not !
alone do sons tread the downward
path, but daughters go out to lives
of shame. And the love of mothers
for their wayward daughters, wit
nessed by wide open doors and
lamps burning at midnight, often
equals the love of this father for his
son. This love is only the love of
man, but does it not help us to
understand the love of God? And
then to think that all the love of
God is ours, that no matter how
great our failures or how black our
sins, if we but turn to him he will;
receive us. "Behold, what man
ner of love the Father hath be
stowed upon us, that we should be
called the sons of God."
