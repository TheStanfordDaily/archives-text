Judging from the recklessness of
the spectators who crowd near
those practicing hammer-throwing
a serious accident is liable to occur.
A word of warning, therefore,
should he sufficient to keep spec
tators at a reasonable distance.
There is just a vague possibility
that should a person be struck by
one of these hammers, he might
never survive to tell the tale, lie
would certainly be in anything but
a communicative state of mind.
Moral: Give the weight throwers
plenty of room.
