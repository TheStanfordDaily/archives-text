A lakge part of the most desir
able students that enter a univer
sity are recruited from the first-class
preparatory schools in its imme
diate vicinity. This fact has re
ceived more and more consideration
by the students in our larger univer
sities, and this consideration has
done much to influence prospective
students. From necessities of the
case, different universities have ad
opted different ways of appealing
to the mind. Some can effectively
bring up the athletic argument, and
the am bit nous prep, athlete is easily
brought into the fold by it. Yale
men are noted for making effective
use of this means. Others plead
from the side of age and culture,
others from the standpoint of frat
ernity advantages, and, in short,
every argument and every influence
is brought to bear by the dif
ferent universities upon the desir
able prep. man. Fora time
at least he is an important in
dividual, and rightly so; for the
character of a university is made
up from the character of its indi
vidual students. This cultivation,
then, of the prep, man is an impor
tant factor in the standing of a uni
versity. The bright man in the
preparatory school is usually a
bright man in college, and the
bright college man generally suc
ceeds in life. His success gives
character and standing to tin; uni
versity itself. Here ;it Stanford
there seems to be little or no ap
preciation of these facts. No ef
fort at all. or perhaps merely unor
ganized and misdirected effort, is
made to cultivate the students of
our California preparatory schools.

Berkeley, however, pursues :i vigor
ous policy in this respect, and with
j noticeable effect. She draws desir
i able athletic and literary material
to her simply through her policy,
| while we look on and wonder at
| the lack of judgment (with apol
ogies to U. (J.) of the men who do
not come to Stanford. We trust
too much in the vision of Stanford's
future greatness. We are too ap
athetic as regards the present. The
remedy we suggest is a systematic
cultivation of the men in the
preparatory schools near at hand,
and in this work our athletic,
musical, and literary organizations
should take an active and har
monious part.
