At a meeting of the Curtis Law
CIuIÂ» Thursday evening the case of
Hitch vs. Chicago Fire Insurance
Company was argued. The facts
were as follows: Ritch insures his
premises against loss by fire for
$15,000. During the great Chi

up with gun-powder by order of the
municipal authorities in order to
stop the spread of the fire. It was
a total loss and Ritch brings suit
to recover on the policy.
The case was argued before Roth
rock, chief just ice, W ills, Stansbury,
Crow, and I)e Wolfe, associates.
Oskison and Stowe acted as at
torneys for the State, and Biglow
and Morgan for Ritch.
The decision in the case argued
at last meeting was then read by
Rot brock, chief justice. The de
cision of the lower court was sus
tained, with Stowe and Morgan, as
sociates, dissenting.
