# Track and Field.

### 
Work'on the cinder path goes
merrily on. Between thirty and
forty candidates of various degrees
of excellence appear every evening,
and the oval presents an active and
businesslike appearance which
promises well for the success of this
year's athletic team.
We will probably be compelled
to depend again upon Bernhard to
represent us in the sprints as no
freshman has yet developed suf
ficient strength and speed to prove
a serious factor. Holbrook starts
well and runs beautifully for the
first fifty yards of the course, but
he has not yet developed wind for
the full distance. Whittaker gives
promise but lacks experience.
No section of the track men
shows better form and greater im
provement from day to day than
the weight men. Under Wilbur's
training a number of candidates
are throwing the hammer and put
ting the shot to distances far be
yond all previous Stanford records.
Freeman and Fickert place the
metal ball nearest to Wilbur's
mark.
Hazzard's hammer-throwing is
daily improving. He throws in
fine form, but is unfortunately a
little light for the event. Fickert,
on the other hand, has all neces
sary weight and strength, but is a
little slow as yet.
It is now definitely settled that
Reynolds will train for the high
as well as the low hurdles. Dole
is working vigorously in this line,
and is rapidly coining into form,
although he is seriously handi
capped by his weight. Col liver,
'90, who was Culver's "second
string" last year, came out last
week,'as did I'ope, '97, a well-built
man, but a novice at hurdling.
It looks as though Captain
Toombs would be left alone in the
high jump, unless Reynolds enters
for this event. Toombs is also try
ing for the broad-jump, a new
event for him. lie has good force
and "lift," but is not, as yet, sure
of his take-off, nor does he run with
sufficient force.
The graduation of Timm and the
withdrawal of Farmer leaves Wilk
inson as our only walker with any
experience. However, seven can
didates have come forward. Jack,
'99, is the only one who has begun
to show form.
