Theuk was a movement set on
foot some time ago to have the con
stitutions of the various organiza
tions under the control of the Stu
dent Body gathered and printed in
pamphlet form. Nothing has been
heard of this matter lately, and it
seems likely that the project will
be entirely abandoned.
A pamphlet of this description
has long been a necessity here.
Time and again persons wishing to
make some change in the govern
ment of such organizations ha ve had
to spend hours and days hunting
fora secretary or raking over
musty papers. The slight trouble
and expense which would be in
curred in having such j tapers printed
would be more than repaid by an
immediate saving in time and
t rouble.
