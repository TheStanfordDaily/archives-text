How many [Stanford students
have ever elimlied to the summit of
any of the neighboring mountains,
<>r, gun in hand, heat through tlie
surrounding foothills for quail, or
even tramped live miles at a stretch
along any of the beautiful roads
that intersect in all directions the
Santa Clara valley? No univer
sity ever had more beautiful nat
ural surroundings than ours. We
are favored with a thousand advan
tages of climate and scenery. Yet
the majority of us make no use of
them whatever. We are content to
sit within doors, hour after hour,
week after week, cramming our
selves stupid with musty lore and
dreaming that man's chief end is to
be a walking encyclopaedia of nn

attested theories and unapplied
facts. When we do turn out for an
hour's relaxation, it is to watch the
other fellows exercise themselves on
gridiron, diamond, or track, or to
go through a prescribed round of
mechanical and perfunctory move
ments under shelter of the gym
nasium. Or if we desire a brief
vacation now and then, we rush
into the city to spend our time in
theatres and second-hand book
stores. Surrounded on every side
with the most charming environ
ment, few of us have the wisdom to
put ourselves in touch occasionally
with Nature, and gather new
strength, new inspiration from her
whose heart is always open and her
face always new. The majority
lead lives too cramped, too artificial,
too suggestive of the dusty,mildewed
volumes which they thumb. We
have a magnificent sheet of water
at our very door, yet no boating;
beautiful hills and forests round us,
but no pedestrian clubs, no camera
clubs or organizations of that sort.
The student should off-set his all
too bookish and artificial existence
by contact with rough invigorating
nature. To be an apt scholar and
a growing man he must do so.
Where there are so many charming
features to invite him out into
the fresh, pure air as are found in
California, lie is simply culpable in
refusing to obey the call.
