A large number of professors and
students visited King's Mountain
last Saturday. Prof, and Mrs.
Jordan, Prof, and Mrs. Barnes,
Prof, and Mrs. Ross, Prof.and Mrs.
(iriggs, and Miss Darrah, with

about fifteen students rode, while
about forty others, mostly students,
walked the entire distance, both
ways.
They were all well entertained at
King's Mountain Hotel,and at night
they made a big camp fire in a
circle of redwood trees. Gathering
round this they sang college songs
and gave the Stanford yell. Mr.
King entertained the crowd by tell
ing how he came round Cape Horn
in 1848. The number who were
fortunate enough to have buggies
or wheels arrived on the campus
Sunday night; the others came
back Monday morning.
