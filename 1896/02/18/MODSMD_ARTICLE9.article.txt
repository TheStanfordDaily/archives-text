# A
						Peculiar Fish.

### 
A peculiar pear-shaped fish, a
new genus of the family Scorpae
nidae, has been received at the
zoological laboratory. It comes
from Hawaii, where it lives in the
lava rocks. These rocks are
black and the fish takes its
color as well as its rough
indented skin from them.
Along the side of the spine is a
groove which would seem to indi
cate that it ejected poison. The
fish does not, like most of its class,
catch its prey by swimming, but
lies in wait in the rocks.
