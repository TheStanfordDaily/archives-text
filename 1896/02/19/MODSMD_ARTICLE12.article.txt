One of the most gratifying fea
tures of this year's revival in track
athletics is the appearance on the
cinder path of a number of entirely
new candidates for athletic honors.
Heretofore only men who have
made records for themselves before
entering the University have been
accustomed to come forward as can
didates for the track team. This
year a number of well-built men
with no former experience in ath
letics are regularly working on the
track. It will be some time, of
course, before these novices can be
come proficient, but some ot* them
are already acquitting themselves
with credit.
This is an encouraging sign. No
university can hope to keep up
any branch of sport by relying
on a few "cracker-jacks" who come
there with an athletic reputation
made in preparatory schools.
There must be a training school for
athletes within the university.
This "rise of the common man"
means more to our athletics than
all the cinder tracks and coaches
money could buy.
