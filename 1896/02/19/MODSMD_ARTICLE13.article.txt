Caspku W. Wiiitnky, editor of
the athletic news of llneper'# Weekly
is making a tour of the Pacific
Coast for the purpose of becoming
more closely acquainted with west
ern athletics. Air. Whitney has

always stood for purity in athletics,
J and has waged a constant war
against professionalism in the guise
of amateurism. Stanford also lias
always aimed at and attained in a
large measure purity in athletics;
and it behooves us to welcome Mr.
Whitney heartily, and show him
the exact status and manner of
conducting our athletics. Ky a
cordial and open welcome of Mr.
Whitney we shall giiin one of the
most important friends of college
athletics. Mr. Whitney is an en
tertaining lecturer, and recently
addressed a large Harvard audi
ence on "Purity in athletics." The
proper authorities should endeavor
to secure the presence of one so
familiar with American and Eng
lish sports in every phase as a
lecturer in our chapel, and that we
may welcome to the University
"one who knows more about foot
hall than any man in America ex
cept Walter Camp."
