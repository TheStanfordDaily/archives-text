# Two Interesting Games of Baseball.
## 
### 
The regular Tuesday practice
game showed what may he ex
pected when the pitchers round
into form; three clean hits off Mc-
Laine and five off Whipple being
the record. Whipple's support was
poor, three hits at least going safe
which should have been cut off.
The captain suggests that in fu
ture games each man learn his po
sition ill the batting order and lie
ready, bat in hand, to take his turn
at the plate. At the end of each
inning the change of sides should
be made as quickly as possible. In
this way the play is made much
more interesting for both player
and spectator. Tuesday's game
was much better in this respect
than has formerly been the case.
