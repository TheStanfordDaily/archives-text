# The 						Revival of the Olympic Games.

### 
The revival of the Olympic games
at Athens promises to be of unusual
interest if the present plans are
; carried out. The initiative was taken
I by France, and in .June, 1894, an
j international congress was held in
I Paris at which it was decided to
I revive the Olympic games in mod-
I ernized form, but with close approxi-
I mation to ancient types and stand-
I aids. The competitors were to
i represent their nationality, none
but amateurs could compete, and
: no money prizes but only badges
| of honor were to be offered. The
I first celebration will be at Athens
on April 5 to 15, 1896. The whole
I scheme is in the hands of a perma
| nent international committee.
Greece is taking an active inter-
I est in the games. The Crown
I Prince is chairman of the Special
Greek committee, and his aid and
suggestions have been invaluable,
t Other statesmen have aided person-
I ally and by financial assistance.
| $36,000 was raised by popular sub
scription in Greece, and M. Averoff,
a patriotic Greek of Alexandria,
has contributed $107,000 for the
restoration of the ancient Stadion.
The Greek government will devote
one half of the proceeds of a special
| design of stamps for live months as
a subsidy for the games. Great
efforts are being made to accommo
date the expected tourists, and
committees are now considering
means of providing suitable enter
! tainment. So the success of the
games from the standpoint of
Grecian hospitality is assured. It
only remains for the foreign ath
i letes to encourage (ireece with their
presence. The fare to Greece is
about $210 from New York.
The Greeks do not expect to carry
off many athletic honors if a full
attendance of foreign athletes is ob
tained, for Grecian athletics have
degenerated. However, several
i flourishing athletic clubs are now
i in operation at Athens and her
i athletes maybe expected to gain
! success in the national sport of dis
j cus throwing.
The general program for these
j games includes the following classes
1 of events:
A. General athletic sports: (1)
Running—llo yards, about; 440
| yds.; 880 yds.; 1653 yds.; 120-yd.
I hurdle: run from Marathon to Ath
ens, 25 miles. (2) Jumping —Run-
i ning broad-jump; hop, step, and
I jump; pole-vault. (3) Discus
j throwing (weight of discus is 4
j pounds 64 ounces). (4) Putting
I shot (weight about 16 pounds).
Length of throw is perpendicular
line to platform or continuation
thereof.
B. Gymnastics: (1) Parallel and
horizontal bars. (There are two
| classes —exercises in strength and
I exercises in agility and grace). (2)

miles; h. sailing yachts, of 3 tons,
5 miles; of from 3 to 10 tons, 10

yds., 11,000 yds., (52 miles, and of
twelve hours, all upon track.
(J. Athletic games: (1) Lawn
tennis. (2) Cricket. (3) Football
(Rugby and Association).
It is feared that this last part of
the program may be a failure, as
there are no grounds in (ireece. lie
sides, ihere is no assurance that or
ganized teams will come from
abroad. Tennis will also depend
upon foreign athletes.
Notwithstanding the enthusiasm
and the earnestness of the Greeks,
there remains a great amount of
work to be completed on the sta
dion. A cinder track must also be
built in the remaining two months
before the games. Some confusion
and disappointment may result un
less greater energy is developed in
carrying on the work.
It is to be hoped that the games
will be a success, and will become
an annual feature of international
athletics, and may aid materially
in restoring the ancient spirit of
Greece.
