# "How I Became a Private in the French Army." —Prof. Brun.
## 
### 
Sometime sifter I landed in New
York 1 noticed thsit the niagsizines
were full of reminiscences of the
Wsirof the Rebellion I noticed
that the generals came first and:
gave their impression of the wsir. |
W hen the material from the high
officers was exhausted, then the
captains lisid their show, and sifter j
that the privates. Tonight I am
going to try to tell you how 1 be-;
citnie si privsite in the French army.
One requisite is to lie born a
Frenchman, and to resich the stgei
of twenty-one or thereabouts, andj
you are sure to be drafted in the i
French army, to be enlisted smd
kept on the list until the sige of j
forty-one, that is to ssiy twenty
years. After the Franco-dernism
war, France had received such a
whipping thsit her people thought it :
was necessary to get every French
man possible into the sirmy to whip j
the < Jernians.
Every Frenchman was obliged to
serve live years ii; the sirmy, or if
he was si college graduate, by pay-i
ing to the French government the
sum of 1500 francs (equivalent to!
si bout $300) si nd enlisting si few
months before drawing his lot, he
need serve only one year; smd si 1 -
most sill college graduates took ad
vantage of this provision of the law,
sis I <1 id with lifly-six college friends.
I readied my regiment on the Mb
day of November, 1 «577, which was
then quartered in Toulon. The
impressions that I received during
that year were not very pleasant.
There are three or four points I
want to emphasize to make you see
I he sidvsi ntage sin American hsis
over a Frenchman in thsit respect.
The discipline wsis rigidly en
forced, smd we soon saw if we
wanted to leave the sirmy sit the
end of one year we had better mind
all the rules and regulations. Trie
first order 1 received was to have
my hair cut; you would be sur
prised to know how particular they
sire in the sirmy about the hair.
A corporsil acquaintance of mine
had the misfortune in si moment of
pique to have his mustsiclie shaved,
and sis a consequence had to go to
jail until his mustsiclie grew to its
former length.
On one occasion some of us were
given leave of absence for four days,
the time expiring at. six o'clock in
the evening. Now the train did
not reach Toulon until seven
o'clock, and because we delayed un
til thsit time we spent something
like eight days in prison.
The French soldier is hardly con
sidered a human being; he is in
the French mind classed sis a spe
cies of cattle. Whether he hsis
means or not, lie can not trsivel in
lirst- or second-class cars. I lis uni
form prevents his doing so. I he
third-class is good enough for him.
The private can not go to the op
era or theatre and by paying the
price sit in the parquet or any good
seats, but must go to ihe third
lerv. None bin officers can have
the best. I want to emphasize —
when you reach the French army
you no longer belong to yourself or
your family, but to the Msite com
pletely. And to illustrate. On
the 22(1 day of February, I»S7H, I
wsis taken sick with a slight sittsick

of typhoid fever, and wsis sent to si
line hospital not far from Toulon.
My parents were notified and came,
wanting to have me removed home,
in which they were refused, and
were allowed to visit me for only
two hours si day.
In one csise si young man had
consumption, and the chaplain ob
tained permission for him to go
home to die. The general has
power to grsint twenty days' lesive
of absence, lie gave this time,
hoping the man might die within
the period, but he did not, but was
linally given ten days more, with
the condition thsit if living sit the
expiration of that time he must be
removed to the hospital, lie fortu
nately died within the limit of
time.
Even the horses sis well as the
men sire drafted in the army.
Once si year you must bring your
horses to the public square for in
spection sind drafting. You are
obliged to msike declaration of the
number of rooms in your house,
smd the number of people consti
tuting your family, and the author
ities will come along smd say, "You
! may occupy this portion of your
' house, and we will take the rest of
'the building for the soldiers."
W hen 1 see your army oflicers en
during discomforts, sleeping in
: tents, etc., as they do, 1 can not
help saying to myself that your
i forefathers fought well for rights
| and principles, and these should
: never lie invaded by the soldier.
The college man was put through
: the same severe discipline as sill
others in the barracks. We could
have no room in the town w here we
could go and be comfortable; smd, if
| caught so doing, were severely pun
, islied. Fifteen days in prison
! meant to us another year in the
army. When one was kept in the
| bstrrsicks, lie had to do menial duty
|in the day time. At night they re
i moved one's stockings, coat, and
I cravat. I never could find out
! why, but those were the things one
had to lose for the night, and then
was obliged to sleep on boards,
thirty or forty men in one room.
1 I was there on several occasions
1 si nd yet would not want to give the
; impression thsit J was si bad man,
becsiuse 1 was not given sin honor
i able discharge. The discipline is
i very absurd; they try to break the
| will, especially of a young man
who has si will of his own.
1 have a little book here, which
in spite of liisiny times wishing 1
might lose it, I have never been
I able to be rid of. When you enter
the army a book like this is given
: you. In it is si description of the
owner, sua! his belongings, then sill
i the regulations smd penalties at
| taclied; and if you read the list you
find death prescribed for almost
j anything you do. This book you
must keep until drafted out of the
j army, at the sige of forty-one. and
i until you lesive the army you must
send this book to hesidqusirtcrs, and
when you want to leave your home
for two months or more you must
report to hesidqusirtcrs. Then
when you arrive sit your destination
j you must report to the authorities.
When 1 csime to America I felt
that life would be worth living if I
could get rid of this book, so I took
out miiuralizsition papers.

I understand the French law
now is that si college graduate can
no longer only serve one year, but
is drafted for three years. It used
to be that young men studying for
the ministry were exempt, but now
they sire all drafted. Young men
who were preparing to be teachers
were also exempt —by serving the
state ten years sis tesichers, but this
is now done away with.
