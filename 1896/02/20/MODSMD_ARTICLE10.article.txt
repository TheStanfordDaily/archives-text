Agitation is iigiiin on foot look
ing towards a trip for the (ilee and
Mandolin Clubs through southern
California during the Easter vaca
tion. This trip will probably take
the place of the one so auspiciously
planned but so lamentably aban
doned last semester, and it is hoped
will meet with a much greater de
gree of success than did its di
lated predecessor. Profiting by
past experience, all arrangements
should be perfected as soon as pos
sible and future contingencies and
opportunities for misunderstand
ings carefully provided for. Then,
with almost certain prospects of a
trip and its attendant pleasures in
view, both clubs can settle down to
conscientious work. Laying aside
all locai prejudices it can not be
doubted that musical organizations,
when properly managed, constitute
the healthiest medium of general
advertising that a university pos
sesses. Our clubs have never as a
combination undertaken any trips
of any consequence; and for that
reason it is all the more desirable
that they should undertake such a
one this year. The present offers a
valuable opportunity for Stanford
energy and Stanford talent to im
press themselves upon the people of
California and those of neighbor
ing states as well.

Voluntary assessments for any
purpose are very difficult to collect
among students, and unless the de
mand is an urgent one which all
at the same time feel to be but
just, it is seldom productive of a
respectable amount. No one can
complain that such levies are not
paid, for each one feels that there
is no authority behind such a levy
and no limit to their number. In
the case of student body assess
ments the case is different. Every
single student who enjoys his
privileges as a student, who has
the remotest interest in the college,
or who takes the least bit of pride
in her welfare and her prestige in
a11»let ies and other lines, should feel
bound to pay such an assessment.
Notwithstanding this, it is a mat
ter of record that much less than
half the students have paid their
student body fees. This too in the
face of the fact that but one dollar
was the assessment for the year and

that the payment of this small
sum would guarantee the holder of,
the receipt as released from all
further assessments.
That these delinquent tax payers
are willing to he such is in many!
cases no fault of theirown. A very j
few are, in truth, unable to payi
even one dollar towards the support I
of athletics; hut in the majority of
cases most delinquents would payi
their just fees if properly pushed by
the collectors. The treasurer
should appoint collectors and get
them to work at once. There seems
to he no reason why a per cent,
sliuuld not he paid for all collec
tions. If so, it is quite probable
that the student body would grant
such authority to the treasurer on
his representations of such need.
Never was there greater need of
money by the baseball and athletic
branches of the University; but
until more than one half the stu
dents have paid their student body
assessments it is not likely that
sufficient funds can be raised by
voluntary subscriptions. It is a
delicate matter to request a volun
tary subscription from those who
paid there student body fees: for if
seventy-live per cent, of the stu
dents were properly approached
there would be no need of these end
less requests for money. Sufficient
money would be derived from the
one official assessment.
