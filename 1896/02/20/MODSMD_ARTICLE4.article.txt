The prospect of inter-class field
days has brought out seversil new
men. None of these hsis shown
any marked ability, though several
are well built and may develop
with practice.
It looks sis though the places left
vacant by Copehmd and Knowles
would be filled by two freshmen,
Brunton and Borke. The former
is si speedy man and si quick starter.
He is si fast sprinter, but his wind
and his strength especially fit him
for the quarter mile. Borke,on the
other hand, hsis no especial speed,
but great endursince, and si long,
finished stride. lie will most
likely give his main attention to
the half mile.
