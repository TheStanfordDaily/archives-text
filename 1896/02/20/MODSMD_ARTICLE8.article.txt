Theodore D. Judah, the subject
of Mr. Hittell's lecture for Friday,
was the man who, in Mr. Hittell's
opinion, was more instrumental
than any one else in bringing to
the attention of Mr. Stanford and
his associates the possibilities of
putting a railroad over the Sierras;
his name is often forgotten in con
nection with the project, but Mr.
11 ittell considers his work too im
portant to be passed over in silence.
This lecture, therefore, promises to
have a peculiar interest for Stan
ford people.
