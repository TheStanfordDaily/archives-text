Thosk in charge of student body
finances and interested in putting
them on a sound basis have such
an entertainment on their hands
now as has never before been han
dled 1)V a student body. This is
no less than an exhibition by Pad
erewski, the great pianist. In
order to secure one performance by
this artist an immense guarantee
was required, but there is every
prospect that a very respectable
profit can be made for the treasury
of the student body. A special
train will take the students to San
Jose returning the same evening
after the performance, at a one-trip
fare for the round trip. This being
;i student enterprise it should be
encouraged by tlw st intents. The low
price of seats for the entertainment
will doubtless give many students
an opportunity for hearing the
pianist who under other circum
stances would feel obliged to forego
the treat.

iior Class is deep in plans
for (' mmericenient week. With
all their scheming we hope that
they will not forget the suggestion
dame in these columns some time
ago regarding the adoption of tlie
cap and gown. The time is ripe
for the introduction of this institu
tion. Michigan, the last of the
great universities east of the Mis
sissippi to take up this badge of the
cloisters, adopted it two years ago.
It is already universally worn at
all the older and larger colleges.
Of course the prevalence of any
custom at another place is no rea
son for its adoption here, but there
are good reasons in favor of the cap
and gown. It is the emblem of
scholastic life, the symbol that
marks us as set-off from the world
in the best sense â€”"In the world,
but not of it." It is time that we
added this tradition to our meager
stock; will 'S)G take the initiative?
