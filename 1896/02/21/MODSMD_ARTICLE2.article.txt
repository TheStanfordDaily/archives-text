# "The Animal Motor."—Dr. Jenkins.

### 
In the various means of accomp
lishing work, a matter of funda
mental importance is the motor
used. The common forms are
gravity, heat, chemical action, elas
ticity of springs, and the momen
tum of air or water in motion.
These are made to run many forms
of machines. In the animal body
the motor, that is the prime motor,
probably chemical energy, acts
through the muscular substance,
which has the power under certain
conditions of contraction. This
substance holds the same relation
to the animal body that steam has
to the engine. There is this dif
ference, that the muscular substance
by its contraction exerts a pull,
while the steam produces a push.
A muscle consists of microscopic
muscular cells, containing the con
tractile substance. The cells are
bound together by connective tis
sue fibers which are continuous at
their extremities into the densely
woven tendons. The whole is a
motor system really woven into a
single piece, with salts of lime de
posited in certain parts in a way to
give them the rigidity and form of
fulcrum, lever, and fixed point of
attachment, and with the contract
ile substance deposited in another
portion to act as the moving pow
er. The whole system is permeated
by blood vessels and completely
supplied with veins.
The muscles of warm-blooded an
imals remain active and contractile
only under the nicely balanced con
ditions of quick and constant sup
ply of oxygen and nutrition, and of
a nearly constant temperature.
The muscles of cold-blooded ani
mals will remain alive under quite a
range of limit of the same conditions.
Muscle physiology lias been
greatly advanced by the investiga
tions made on the frog muscle.
When a stimulus is given to the
nerve by an electric shock, a ner
vous impulse goes along the nerve
to the muscle cells. This causes a
contraction of ihe muscle, which
pulls upon the lever. A vibrating
tuning-fork connected with anelec
trical mechanism is made to record
its vibrations by the side of the
muscle tracing, thus giving the
time in very small fractions of a
second; this shows what are called
the "phases of a muscular contrac
tion." It allows the exact study of
the latent period.

The muscle may be subjected to
many conditions of temperature,
additions of drugs, etc., and tracings
of the contraction taken for each
set of conditions. These compared
form a basis for study of the mus
cular substance. There are differ
ent kinds of muscular substance,
the voluntary, the cardiac or heart
muscle, and the smooth muscles,
such as are found in the walls of
the alimentary canal. The skeletal
contracts only on receiving a stim
ulus from the outside; it contracts
promptly—ceases contraction on
the cessation of the stimulus.
The cardiac muscular substance
has the power of rhythmic contrac
tion independent of external
stimuli. Such stimuli have only
the effect of quickening or lessening
the rhythm. This is the character
of the contraction best adopted to
working a pump that must be con
tinuous in its action. The hearts
of frogs and turtles may be removed
from the bodies of the animals and
so arranged as to pump blood from
one reservoir to another for hours,or
even days.
With sufficient care the heart of
a mammal can be isolated in the
same way. This has been done
with hearts of dogs.
The activity of muscular sub
stance expresses itself in four dif
ferent forms: mechanical in con
tracting and producing motion,
thermal in producing heat, electri
cal, and chemical. In man the
main work of muscles is mechanical
and thermal, being the source of
motion and the main source of the
heart of the body. In some, such
as the torpedo (fish) on our coast,
certain muscles have lost the power
of contraction and heightened the
electrical power.
The experimental demonstrations
were made by Miss Briggs and
Messrs. Wilbur, Grow, and liedon.
