# First Inter-Class Game.
## 
### 
The first of the series of three
| inter-class baseball contests took
! place Thursday, '96 winning from
• '99 l>y a margin of three. The
' game was close and interesting from
i beginning to end, and the cTowd of
! 200 on the bleachers made things
j lively by applauding every play.
A much smaller score would have
| been the result had the receiving
ends of the batteries been in better
shape. Morrison could not hold
! McLaine, while no one was pre
vented from stealing bases by either
catcher. Austin's work in the box
was very fair. Fife and Vander
veer made some good fielding plays
for '96, and Cochran and Gould
| wielded the bat with good effect,
jOn the other side Smith, Mackin
tosh, and Freeman did good bat
ting and the latter fielded well on
i first.
