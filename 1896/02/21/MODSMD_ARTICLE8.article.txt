# The 						Harvard-Yale Rupture.
## 
### 
Prof. Albert Bushnell Hart of
Harvard College, after reviewing
the causes which led to the athletic
separation of Harvard and Yale, in
the current Harvard Graduated
Magazine, states that college athlet
ics have already been greatly bene
fited by the disruption between the
two universities. Prof. Hart says:
"W hat have been the net results
of Harvard's present policy? The
liveliest football season since 1.S8V);
four interesting great games with
Cornell, Princeton, Michigan, and
Pennsylvania; plenty of minor con
tests and brisk class and scrub
games. On the other hand, relief
from the extreme excitement and
bitter rivalry of last year's Vale-
Harvard game; freedom from the
wear and tear of intercollegiate
diplomacy; escape from any idea of
exclusive arrangements with any
body; acceptance of the policy of
giving to any great institution the
advantage of 'the most favored na
tion' clause a basis fora resumption
of sports with our ancient rival;
the conviction in the public mind
that Harvard is in earnest in her
attempt to make athletics a sport
and not a pursuit."â€”K.r.
