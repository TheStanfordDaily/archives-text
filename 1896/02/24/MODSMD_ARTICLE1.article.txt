# Friday's Lecture by Theodore H. Hittel.

### 
Mr. Theodore H. Hittel lectured
in the chapel last Friday, having
for his subject "Theodore 1). Judah,
and his part in the building of ihe
Central Pacific Railroad." The
classes in engineering were dis
missed to hear the lecture, and at
tended in a body. Mr. Hittell was
introduced by Prof. Mary Sheldon
Barnes, and spoke for an hour.
He said: The subject of an At
lantic-Pacific railroad was talked of
even before the acquisition of Cal
ifornia. All who treated of the
subject recognized its feasibility;
even ihe Senate had agreed that it
was the theme of all classes of the
population, but more especially of
the farmers. Its more enthusiastic
partisans were continually urging
points in its favor: the long and
dangerous route around the Horn;
the needs of emigrants demanded a
closer connection with the East;
and that the road was necessary
from every point <>112 view, business,
military, arid social. But still, cap
ital and men were too timid to un
dertake the project until they
should have its feasibility clearly
demonstrated by a competent man.
Theodore D. .Judah was that man.
The occasion of his coming to
California was the construction of
the Sacramento Valley Railroad.
He was sent for from the East to
take charge of this road, and laid
out and built it with that energy
and success which ever atter char
acterized him. This road he made
the foundation for the Central Pa
cific.
He was instrumental in the call
ing of the railroad convention in
San Francisco. His presentation
of the practicability of the project
and his complete information on
the subject brought about the de
cision to build the road.
Judging by his earnestness, un
tiring energy, ami activity more
thoroughly interested the people in
the road and called the attention of
Stanford, Huntington, Hopkins,
and Crocker to it. These men
afterwards became the owners of the
road. The young enthusiastic en
gineer then went to Washington,
I). C., and by the most extraordi
nary efforts interested Congress and
President Lincoln in his favorite
subject. He was granted the priv
ilege of the floor in both houses,
and worked almost incessantly until
he obtained the passage of the bill
on .July 1, 18C>'2, giving all the
liberal grants, aids, and encourage
ments which the government has
always given to railroads.
Judah then exercised his talent
choosing and surveying the most
practicable routes. After testing
three different ways he chose the
present route, which has proven to
be the best.
The construction of the road was
begun on .Jan. 8, IS(k>, at the cor
ner of 4t,h and K streets, Sacra
mento, (iov. Stanford throwing up
the first shovel of dirt.
Although capital was scarce, and
discouragements many and ser
ious, Judah by his genius and un
wavering loyalty kept the road
under construction. So obstacles
beyond what he had shown were
encountered. As chief engineer he
superintended the construction of

the first part of the road, and after
he had overcome the most difficult
impediments of the undertaking
and made everything clear in front
he met an untimely death on Nov.
2, 18(>o, at the age of thirty-seven
years.
Here perished a genius. He had
pointed out the possibilities of this
great undertaking and had brought
them to be fully realized. But for
him the road could never have been
built. He always stood in the van
of the light and bore the brunt of
the battle. He fell a noble sacri
fice in point of what would doubt
less have been a great and useful
life. But the results of his labors
are seen in the subsequent pros
perity of his associates.
