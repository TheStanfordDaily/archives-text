Now that the baseball manage
ment has secured the services of
such a coach as Mr. Lange, every
player, no matter what his ability,
should turn out regularly at prac
tice. The training he will re
ceive will more than repay him,
and will tit him for future seasons.
It is seldom that amateurs are en
abled to learn under the super
vision of such a coach as Stanford
has engaged, and all men of any
ability should take advantage of
this opportunity.
From now on let every player
work conscientiously. Let us go in
to win, and by drawing a little on
our latent enthusiasm, let us carry
before us the baseball champion
ship for another season.
