The success of the baseball man
agement in securing the services of I
Mr. Lange brings with it some val-i
liable lessons which might be well
applied to future needs of student

body organizations. Heretofore it
has been with the greatest difliculty
that money could he raised by vol
untary subscriptions for student
body purposes. The one dollar as
sessment at the beginning of each
year has never been fully collected,
nor indeed has the greater part of
it been secured. That this is due
to the method of securing the as
sessment is shown by the success of
the baseball management in secur
ing Mr. Lange. The student body
will never be backward in suit
scribing if the purpose of an assess
ment is adequately set before it.
This is what was done to secure
Mr. Lange, and what, unfortunately,
is o'mitted when collectors attempt
to secure the one dollar assessment.
The student body always has the
success of its organizations at heart,
and will never fail to show its lib
erality, provided the needs of any
organization are properly presented.
