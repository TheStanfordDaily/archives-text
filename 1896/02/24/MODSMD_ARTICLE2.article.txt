# The 						Basket-Ball Game.

### 
The Castilleja basket-ball team
was defeated last Friday by the
Stanford team, the score being one
to nothing. The play was very ex
citing; the large crowd on the
grandstand and those seated in the
shade of the trees enjoyed the play
as much as if it had been a game
of football.
The teams were very evenly
matched, and at the end of the
third period of play the score stood
nothing to nothing. The captains,
however, agreed to play an extra
five minutes, so that one side or
the other might win. They had
played but a few minutes of the ad
ditional time when Miss Kiefer
threw the ball into Castilleja's bas
ket, and the game was over.
Misses McCray, Merritt, and
Morley played the star games for
Stanford. They showed remark
able speed and were always in the
right place. Miss Wing, captain
of Castilleja's team, played a bril
liant game for her side. She was
closely followed by Misses Shelley
and Ducker.
The following were the players
and their positions:
ST A N F( )H I). CASTILLEJ A.
Tucker r h Ducker
Merritt 1 h Hessinger
Walter c h Johnson
Kiefer re..." Wing
McCray c Shelley
Corbert 1 c Ferguson
Ducker r g Bromfield
Ryan eg Stevenson
Morley 1 g Charles
The basket-ball team feel justly
proud of their victory, and today
they challenged the San Jose Nor
mal School, and also sent a, chal
lenge to the Young Women's Bas
ket-ball Team of Berkeley. So we
shall probably have in the near fu
ture intercollegiate basket-ball
games, as well as football and
baseball.
