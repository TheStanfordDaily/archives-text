# Joaquin Miller.

The students of Stanford will
have a rare opportunity of hearing
tomorrow evening Joaquin Miller,
the poet of the Sierras, on "A hint
from nature." It is needless to say
that his very words will be full of
the poetry gained from a near
knowledge and close communica
tion with nature. Mr. Miller has of
late almost lived the lifeof a hermit,
and his visit is to be valued more
for this reason.
Cincinnatus Hiner Miller, for
Joaquin is only his nom de plume,
was born in Indiana on Nov. 10,
1841. He removed with his par
ents to Oregon in 1854, became a
miner in California, and returned
to Oregon in 1860 and studied law.
He was judge in Grant county,
Oregon, in 18H6-70, and during this
period he began his literary work.
From early boyhood he had written
verses not devoid of merit though
ignorant of the rules of versification
and grammar. Having published
a paper in deference of Joaquin
Muiietta, the Mexican brigand, he
signed his first collection of poems
by the latter's first name, lie was
abroad in 1870 and while there
he prepared his first volume of sus
tained verse, which met the praise
of the English critics. He became
a journalist in Washington, 1). C.,
and in 1887 returned to California.
Besides his successful prose and
poetical works he has written
several successful plays, including
"The Danites." His chief poetical
works are "Songs of the Sierras,"
"Songs of the Desert," "Songs of
Italy," "Songs of the Mexican
Seas." His chief prose works are
"The Baroness of New York," "The
Danites in the Sierras," "Shadows
of Shasta," and " '49, or the Gold-
Seekers of the Sierras."
The Saturday Review,published in
London, thus characterized Mr.
Miller's first efforts: "A new poet
has come from a new country. . . .
Whatever his faults —and they are
many and flagrant—there can be
no doubt that he possesses the gen
uine poetic faculty. . . . The fact
that his lines glow with tropical
passion, and that his descriptions
transport us in imagination to the
scenes among which they were
composed, compel us to forgive him
the lawlessness with which he
tramples on the conventional limi
tations of art.''
Every student who fails to hear
this bard of the Sierras is undoubt
edly neglecting the last opportunity
he will ever have to hear the one
voice above all others that has
echoed the secrets of California's
mysterious mountains and valle\'s.
