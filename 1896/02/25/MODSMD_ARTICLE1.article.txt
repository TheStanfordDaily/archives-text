# "BEATEN PATHS."
## Discourse by Prof. M. W. Haskell of the University of California. 
### 
The subject of my talk is well
stated in this homely little poem
which appeared in the last number
of the Altrurion. The title of the
poem is "The Calf-Path."
< )ne day through the primeval wood
A calf walked home, as good calves
should;
Hut made a trail all bent askew,
A crooked trail, as all calves do.
Since then two hundred years have
tied,
And, I infer, the calf is dead.
Hut still he left behind his trail,
And thereby hangs my moral tale.
The trail was taken up next dav
Hy a lone dog that passed that
way;
And then a wise bell-wether sheep
Pursued the trail o'er vale and
steep,
And drew the flock behind him, too,
As good bell-wethers always do.
And from that day, o'er hill and
glade,
Through those old woods a path
was made.
And many men wound in and out,
And dodged and turned and bent
about,
And uttered words of righteous
wrath,
Heeause 'twas such a crooked path;
Hut still they followed—do not
laugh—
The first migration of that calf,
And through that winding wood
way stalked
Heeause he wabbled when he
walked.
This forest path became a lane,
And bent and turned and turned
again;
This crooked lane became a road,
Where many a poor horse with his
load.
Toiled on beneath the burning sun,
And traveled some three miles in
one.
And thus a century and a half
They trod the foot-steps o.f that calf.
The years passed on in swiftness
fleet;
The road became a village street,
And this, before men were aware,
A city's crowded thoroughfare;
And soon the central street was
this
Of a renowned metropolis,
And men two centuries and a half
Trod in the footsteps of that calf.
Kaeh day a hundred thousand rout
Followed the zigzag calf about:
And o'er his crooked journey went
The trafl'.c of a continent.
A hundred thousand men were led
l>y one calf near three centuries
dead. •
They followed still his crooked
way,
And lost one hundred years a day;
For thus such reverence is lent
To well-established precedent.
A moral lesson this might teach,
Were I ordained and called to
preach.
For men are prone to go it blind
Along the calf-path of the mind,
And work away from snn to sun
To do what other men have done.
They follow in the beaten track.
And out and in, and forth and
back,
And still their devious course pur
sue,
To keep the path that others do.

Hut liow the wise old wood-gotta
laugh,
W'lit) saw the first primeval calf!
Ah! many things this tale might
teach —
Hut 1 am not ordained to preach.
There is a lesson in this poem to
which we may profitably devote
some consideration. It pictures the
blind following of authority with
no attempt at self-orientation. On
many subjects the world has
gradually drifted into lixed modes
of thought and action, and holds
fast to them because the fathers
did —solely on the weight of auth
ority. The so-called science of
jurisprudence is founded on in
numerable cases and decisions of
the courts — for the most part
awarded to that side which can
present the strongest array of par
allel cases. In the medical profes
sion we have seen every effort to
modify their many barbarous
methods resisted with obstinacy
and bitterness. In the educational
world the idea that Greek, Latin,
and mathematics alone constituted
an education was long the preva
lent one, and the history of the
Christian religion has been a con
tinual strife in behalf of estab
lished doctrine until the essential
features are entirely obscured.
The Nineteenth Century marks a
revolution against authority in
every department of human thought
and action —in science, in educa
tion, in religion, in the constitution
of society. Whence does this re
volt against authority come, and
whither will it lead us? Generally
stated, it has been produced by the
widening of the sphere of human
thought and action, and a conse
quent perception of the relations
between fields formerly considered
distinct.
Hut it is of the religious move
ment that 1 wish to speak. The
followers of all the religions with
which we are acquainted have from
time immemorial held each other
up to scorn. Jews have persecuted
Christians and Christians the Jews;
Catholics have persecuted Protest
ants and Protestants the Catholics.
Ai d what is it after all? A mere
conflict of authority.
I n our day the comparative study
of religions is turning the attention
of broad-minded men away from
differences and bringing them to
see the resemblances to lie found in
the different religions; and gradu
ally the feeling is dawning that we
have missed all that is permanent
and vital in religion.
Hut in the first leaction the pen
dulum is liable to swing too far,
and men are liable to conclude that
all religion is a farce. It behooves
us then to look closely and see if
we can not find the permanent in
religion. Is it religion, after all,
that is tottering? Once we sepa
rate in our minds religion and the
ology, we can instantly answer, no!
The religions principles at the
foundation are the same with all
peoples: it is in their theology that
they differ; and it is theology that
is crumbling. People are winnow
ing over the creeds and isms, keep
ing what is good and casting away
thechaft. I he idea, of salvation,
for instance, which belongs to the
ology and not religion, and on
which rests the whole scheme of

i Christ's position in the church, is
fast losing ground. The need of
salvation is not a natural feeling,
else there would be no need of re
: vivals to create it. The belief rests
| entirely on authority and will he
gradually cast aside, for beliefs
founded on authority alone can not
live. They must have the approval
of the mind, else they are in con
stant danger of rejection as the
mind develops.
The evils of a reliance upon au
thority are two: One is that it
I hampers the activity of the mind,
I often appearing to arrest its growth
altogether. The other comes when
the authority is overthrown. In
the reaction the tendency is to des
pise and dishonor the lost author
ity in proportion to its previous
honor. The character of Jesus has
suffered in this way. Me has been
attacked by skeptics as he never i
could have been had not too zeal
ous believers lifted him out of the
pale of humanity into deity. No-!
body would think of picking to
j pieces his beautiful sermons and
the account of his life, had not the I
claim of absolute perfection been i
set up for him —a claim he never \
advanced himself. This is a se
! rious defect and it can be avoided j
only by resting authority on simple!
reason. The rejection of human
j authority will not bring anarchy.
We shall still have the authority of
truth and conscience. These are
growing in power every day, and
their sufficiency can not be ques
tioned.
