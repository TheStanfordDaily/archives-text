The remarkable contention of
Dr. Jordan that all Englishmen in
the world are blood relationships
not very far back, is somewhat
startling but apparently quite
demonstrable. When the average
man is shown by a mathematical
calculation to have more of the
blood of Alfred the Great in his
veins than has the present Queen
of England, he is liable to feel him
self a person of slightly greater im
portance than he had imagined.
Hut what will be said by the mem
bers of the Four Hundred—and by
the way every little community
has its Four Hundred—when in
formed that their descent is neither
better nor worse than that of John
Smith and Richard Roe? Should
Dr. Jordan see fit to give to the
world the strange results of his in
vestigation, we may expect such an
outcry from the followers of the
late lamented Ward MacAllister
that free silver and the new woman
will forthwith sink to the position
of fifth-rate issues.
