Ouk track management has dis
played-a commendable spirit in en
couraging the preparatory schools
on this side of Ihe bay to form
track teams and to bold an inter
scholastic field-day on Stanford
grounds. We need the support
and friendship of these schools. We
can best arouse this spirit by assist
ing them in their athletics, and by
giving them the use of our grounds
for their sports.
