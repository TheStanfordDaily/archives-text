# THE 						PADEREWSKI RECITAL.
## Something About the Famous Pianist Who Will Give a, Concert for Stanford Students. 
### 
Stanford students are promised a
rare treat for next Saturday even
ing. The great I'aderewski, now'
on his third season, is to appear in
San .lose on that evening under the
auspices of our own associated stu
dents.
I'aderewski was born in l'odolia.
a province of Russian Poland, on
the sixth of November. 1800. lie
received all his musieal jzifts from
his mother. From a boy he was
very fond of music and displayed
his remarkable genius on many oc
casions. However, he received lit
tle or no training until bis twelfth
year, when he went to Warsaw and
studied under the best masters.
Such rapid progress was made that
when only sixteen years of age he
undertook a concert tour of Russia.
His playing excited little admira
tion and bis t rip was far from be
ing a success. Returning to the
Warsaw Conservatory he resumed
his studies and two years later was
considered far enough advanced to
he appointed to a professorship.
Later he went to Berlin where, un
der such teachers as Kiai and l'r
han, he had most excellent oppor
tunities for improvement. Three
years later he accepted a position
;ir- professor at the Conservatory of
St rasburg.
Ip to this time apparent ly no
one had suspected Paderewski's la
tent greatness. It takes genius to
discover genius. i! so happened
that during his stay in Strasburg
he became intimately acquainted
with the famous Polish actress
Mine. Modjeska, who was perchance
the lirst to recognize bis rare gifts;
and the conclusion naturally fol
lows that it was due largely to her
sympathetic encouragement that
I'aderewski gave up the drudgery
of teaching and went to Vienna, to
prepare himself for the career of a
concert pianist.
II is debut took place in \ ienna.
but did little to establish bis fame.
It remained for Paris and the Par
isian public to recognize bis merits
on his appearance there in 1881).
The public and press treated him
so kindly that he was induced, in
181)0, to cross the Channel and give
a concert in London. The result,
however, was a keen disappoint
ment. A very small audience
greeted him and the total receipts
did not exceed $.">().
Upon bis first appearance in
America, in New York on Novem
ber 17. 181)1, lie was greeted by an
immense and enthusiastic audi
ence, ami from that time his repu
tation as the world's greatest liv
ing pianist was made. The critics
were at first chary of recognizing
his merits, but the public every
where accorded him a succession of
triumphs. In less than six months
I'aderewski gave one hundred
and seventeen concerts, his fame
growing all the time like an ava
lanche.

In 1894 he made another tour of
this country, and his success was
even greater than before.
As regards his style of playing,
I'aderewski is a living refutation of
the assertion that a trace of charla
tanism is essential to the success of
even a genius. He makes no con
cessions to the popular craving for
cheap tunes, but gives his hearers 1
only the choicest products of the
highest musical geniuses. He does
not need to resort to such tricks to
succeed. What )repossesses an aud
ience at once in bis favor is the gen
uine simplicity of his bearing; the
absence of all desire to please.
Perhaps the first thing that
strikes the average spectator on
seeing I'aderewski at the piano is
the entire; absence of effort in his
performance. Nothing is difficult

for 11i 111. Vanity is also an clement
that is outiinly lacking in his na
ture.
i 1 1<' supitMllachievement of
I'aderewski's technique i> the dem
onstration that the singing tone
and perfect control of every variety
of tone color ate possible in all cir
cumstances, no matter how difli
cull the passage. He has held the
theory that the singing tone must
he preserved at all hazards, and his
accurate renderii g of the same has
contributed in no small degree to
his success.
Added to his genius in (his res
pect is the marvelous rhythm which
he introduces into hi< playing.
Kvery note must have the proper
duration or the rhythm is disturbed.
Kvery tone must be sounded with
the corrvct dynamic relationship to
those which precede and those
which follow it, or the rhythm dis
a ppea rs.
But laying aside the mechanical
features of I'aderewski's playing,
behind the technic is the soul of an
artist. Without musical emotion
that can be communicated to the
hearer, the most exquisite touch in
t he world will have no effect. Pad

erewski has a powerful musical or
ganization and his soul is filled
with temperament and emotion.
Whenever he plays he throbs with
emotion and is lost to all about
him. He has no looks nor gri
maces for the audience. No public
smile ever sits on his lips, yet if
you look closely you will observe
subtle changes of expression on bis
features; he is listening intently to
his own playing, and if the tone is
as beautiful as he wishes it, an ex
pression of pleasure flits across his
features. He seems to be far away
in dreamland, playing for himself
alone; and bis reward is nottheap
plause of the audience, but the de
light in bis own playing.
That I'aderewski should have
triumphed over the cultured au
diences of the civilized world is a
tribute not only to his wonderful
artistic ability, but also to hissyni
pathetic and magnetic personality.
Notwithstanding his phenomenal

success in all countries, he lias re
tained the geniality and simplicity
of I'aderewski the debutant. One
of his noblest traits is his genuine
modesty, a trait which has not
altered bv the fact that lie now re
ceives homage as the greatest liv
ing pianist and one of the most
gifted composers. I)e Pachman,
tlie famous pianist, has said "that
I'aderewski is the most modest
artist that I have ever seen, and
one of the very few musicians who
does uu| behave as if lie considered
himself the greatest man in the
world."
I'aderewski is a most prodigious
worker and is in constant practice.
To ibis day he will practice ten or
twelve hours more a day when pre
paring fora concert tour to keep
his lingers supple and bis memory
rcliable. It is related that a curious
statistician once occupied a room
adjoining I'aderewski's. but of
curiosity took the trouble to note
that during one of his practicing
periods the pianist executed a par
ticular cadenza without a moment's
cessation something like 7"Â»() times.
Hut the secret of his success lies in
the fact that he practices not

merely with his fingers but with
his brain too. lit; once told a
friend that lie often lies awake for
hours at night going over his next
program mentally, note for note,
trying to get at the very essence of
every bar.
Such exhaustive work is not con
ducive to good health, and he often
| must needs be careful of himself on
j this score. Whenever he gives a
concert all his faculties are so com
pletely engaged that he is quite ex
hausted at the end and is unable to
to sleep for hours. lie is pas
sionately fond of billiards and he
regards it as a sort of tonic, for be
i says, '"If 1 walk or ride or merely
rest, 1 goon thinking all the time
j and my nerves get no real rest.
Hut when 1 play billiards I can
forget everything, and the result is
mental rest and physical rest com
| billed."
Like Liszt and Rubenstein Pad
: crewski lias an intense personal
! magnetism which especially at
tracts women. In all bis concerts
be is pleasant and obliging and
j seldom refuses the hearty encores
of his audiences.
I To sum up his personality and
! characteristics in the words of Mr.
.J. (i. Iluneker: "His life has been
! full of sorrow, of adversity, of
vicioitsness never. His heart is
pure, his life clear, his ideals
! loft v."

Stanford students are promised a
rare treat for next Saturday even
ing. The great I'aderewski, now'
on his third season, is to appear in
San .lose on that evening under the
auspices of our own associated stu
dents.
I'aderewski was born in l'odolia.
a province of Russian Poland, on
the sixth of November. 1800. lie
received all his musieal jzifts from
his mother. From a boy he was
very fond of music and displayed
his remarkable genius on many oc
casions. However, he received lit
tle or no training until bis twelfth
year, when he went to Warsaw and
studied under the best masters.
Such rapid progress was made that
when only sixteen years of age he
undertook a concert tour of Russia.
His playing excited little admira
tion and bis t rip was far from be
ing a success. Returning to the
Warsaw Conservatory he resumed
his studies and two years later was
considered far enough advanced to
he appointed to a professorship.
Later he went to Berlin where, un
der such teachers as Kiai and l'r
han, he had most excellent oppor
tunities for improvement. Three
years later he accepted a position
;ir- professor at the Conservatory of
St rasburg.
Ip to this time apparent ly no
one had suspected Paderewski's la
tent greatness. It takes genius to
discover genius. i! so happened
that during his stay in Strasburg
he became intimately acquainted
with the famous Polish actress
Mine. Modjeska, who was perchance
the lirst to recognize bis rare gifts;
and the conclusion naturally fol
lows that it was due largely to her
sympathetic encouragement that
I'aderewski gave up the drudgery
of teaching and went to Vienna, to
prepare himself for the career of a
concert pianist.
II is debut took place in \ ienna.
but did little to establish bis fame.
It remained for Paris and the Par
isian public to recognize bis merits
on his appearance there in 1881).
The public and press treated him
so kindly that he was induced, in
181)0, to cross the Channel and give
a concert in London. The result,
however, was a keen disappoint
ment. A very small audience
greeted him and the total receipts
did not exceed $.">().
Upon bis first appearance in
America, in New York on Novem
ber 17. 181)1, lie was greeted by an
immense and enthusiastic audi
ence, ami from that time his repu
tation as the world's greatest liv
ing pianist was made. The critics
were at first chary of recognizing
his merits, but the public every
where accorded him a succession of
triumphs. In less than six months
I'aderewski gave one hundred
and seventeen concerts, his fame
growing all the time like an ava
lanche.

In 1894 he made another tour of
this country, and his success was
even greater than before.
As regards his style of playing,
I'aderewski is a living refutation of
the assertion that a trace of charla
tanism is essential to the success of
even a genius. He makes no con
cessions to the popular craving for
cheap tunes, but gives his hearers 1
only the choicest products of the
highest musical geniuses. He does
not need to resort to such tricks to
succeed. What )repossesses an aud
ience at once in bis favor is the gen
uine simplicity of his bearing; the
absence of all desire to please.
Perhaps the first thing that
strikes the average spectator on
seeing I'aderewski at the piano is
the entire; absence of effort in his
performance. Nothing is difficult

for 11i 111. Vanity is also an clement
that is outiinly lacking in his na
ture.
i 1 1<' supitMllachievement of
I'aderewski's technique i> the dem
onstration that the singing tone
and perfect control of every variety
of tone color ate possible in all cir
cumstances, no matter how difli
cull the passage. He has held the
theory that the singing tone must
he preserved at all hazards, and his
accurate renderii g of the same has
contributed in no small degree to
his success.
Added to his genius in (his res
pect is the marvelous rhythm which
he introduces into hi< playing.
Kvery note must have the proper
duration or the rhythm is disturbed.
Kvery tone must be sounded with
the corrvct dynamic relationship to
those which precede and those
which follow it, or the rhythm dis
a ppea rs.
But laying aside the mechanical
features of I'aderewski's playing,
behind the technic is the soul of an
artist. Without musical emotion
that can be communicated to the
hearer, the most exquisite touch in
t he world will have no effect. Pad

erewski has a powerful musical or
ganization and his soul is filled
with temperament and emotion.
Whenever he plays he throbs with
emotion and is lost to all about
him. He has no looks nor gri
maces for the audience. No public
smile ever sits on his lips, yet if
you look closely you will observe
subtle changes of expression on bis
features; he is listening intently to
his own playing, and if the tone is
as beautiful as he wishes it, an ex
pression of pleasure flits across his
features. He seems to be far away
in dreamland, playing for himself
alone; and bis reward is nottheap
plause of the audience, but the de
light in bis own playing.
That I'aderewski should have
triumphed over the cultured au
diences of the civilized world is a
tribute not only to his wonderful
artistic ability, but also to hissyni
pathetic and magnetic personality.
Notwithstanding his phenomenal

success in all countries, he lias re
tained the geniality and simplicity
of I'aderewski the debutant. One
of his noblest traits is his genuine
modesty, a trait which has not
altered bv the fact that lie now re
ceives homage as the greatest liv
ing pianist and one of the most
gifted composers. I)e Pachman,
tlie famous pianist, has said "that
I'aderewski is the most modest
artist that I have ever seen, and
one of the very few musicians who
does uu| behave as if lie considered
himself the greatest man in the
world."
I'aderewski is a most prodigious
worker and is in constant practice.
To ibis day he will practice ten or
twelve hours more a day when pre
paring fora concert tour to keep
his lingers supple and bis memory
rcliable. It is related that a curious
statistician once occupied a room
adjoining I'aderewski's. but of
curiosity took the trouble to note
that during one of his practicing
periods the pianist executed a par
ticular cadenza without a moment's
cessation something like 7"Â»() times.
Hut the secret of his success lies in
the fact that he practices not

merely with his fingers but with
his brain too. lit; once told a
friend that lie often lies awake for

program mentally, note for note,
