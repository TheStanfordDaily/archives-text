In connection with the article on
Paderewski, which appears on the
front page of this issue, we wish to
call attention again to the fact that
this noted pianist comes to San
Jose under student body manage
ment. It is a large undertaking,
as the guarantee which must be
paid for Paderewski's appearance
is immense, and any unexpected
lack of attendance would bring se
rious straits upon our already em
barrassed finances.
We trust that this direct appeal
is unnecessary. Attractions such as
I'aderewski are few and far between
on this coast. The chance of hear
ing, at a moderate price, the great
est living exponent of the classic
masters should insure a large at
tendance from this University, and
from the sale of .tickets this after
noon there need be no fear for the
success of the undertaking from a
financial standpoint.
