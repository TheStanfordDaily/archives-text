While our college friends in the
East are cooped up in their rooms
dissipating their energies in the
task of keeping warm, we are en
joying all the glories of outdoor ex
ercise under a semi-tropical sun. It
is difficult to realize what terrors
in the form of cold and storm are
being suffered in the eastern states
when ours are the beautiful lawns,
the glorious sunshine, the inviting
mountains, the evergreen trees,
the pleasant walks and drives.
It needs only a comparison of
the condition of affairs here and
elsewhere to make Stanford stu
dents extremely patriotic. Not to
speak of the great spirit of freedom
and liberality which permeates the
very atmosphere in this college
community and which is equaled
nowhere in history, it is certainly
safe to say that there is im> uni
versity in the country which en
joys the advantages of location pos
sessed by Stanford.
