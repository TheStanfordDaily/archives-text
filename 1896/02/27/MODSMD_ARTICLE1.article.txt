# A
						Hint From Nature.
## 
### 
Some one said "I see you are to
talk to the young ladies and gentle
men of Stanford on human nature."
1 said ''No, not human nature, nor
horse nature —but just nature."
1 thank you for your good humor —
you receive me kindly. I could
amuse you, hut a man hearing my
years, has laid upon his shoulders
heavier work than your amuse
ment.
A good many years ago, nearly
a dozen, I came home after some
years in other lands and went up
into the mountains to meditate
and digest what I had seen abroad.
Crossing the continent of my land
where my fathers lived, fought, and
fell, I observe this: the American
people are unhappy. There is
more happiness to the square mile
in Europe. Europeans lead a
purer, larger life than we money
getting, greedy Americans are liv
ing. I'nderstand you are not the
representative people. You are
not the masses hut the selection.
Now what is the reason we are
not content? Bluntly, the Ameri
can is not at peace with himself,
because he is not near himself.
He does not know nature, therefore
he does not love nature. We put
<m the love of nature as we put on
a, coat, for an occasion.
For an American, "A primrose
by the water's brim a simple prim
rose is to him"; and 1 think it
must be an English primrose to ex
citeany particular interest. We have
paid millions to Scotland for the
simple songs of Burns, to look upon
the scenes he looked upon, to place
our feet where the poor plough boy
placed his feet while following the
plough, to see as he saw his neigh
bors when he sung their sorrows
and their joys.
Consider, if you please, the dif
ference: An English gentleman
lives in the country among the
Druid oaks. For a brief season he
takes his family and to the
city, but with the precision of the
clock at the end of the opera sea
son he is back again with his
family, living the old life that he
loves. Mark another distinction:
The Englishman goes abroad and
makes his money and comes home
to spend it. The American makes
his money at home and goes abroad
to spend it. The round-up at the
end of the year makes a mighty
difference in the balance sheet of
this republic.
A friend of mine who passed over
the other day said, "1 know you
are right about fun. We are not
funny in America. 1 was not only
gray, but had lost every gray hair
out of my head-—and a great deal
of the gray matter —before 1 tried
to be funny." That was Bill Nye.
We are not funny ; and let us
abandon the idea. Are we a race
of fools to be forever laughing at
the would-be wits and clowns?
Let us be sincere. We are uif
happy because we are far away
from t he truth and our better selves,
living remote from nature.
Let us get up out of fault-Hnd
ing. Let us see what we might
gain from mother nature. Let
there be light !
Consider the very iirst word you
find in the one great book of poetry,
it you want light. Do you care

for the infinite colors —the light!
and the darkness together? Howl
much there is in color —the soft
touch of color. See the tawny
breast of the lion —the color of j
California, the inane of strong,
long grass waving in the wind and
tossing like the sea.
What do we know of perfume?
The perfume of the jocund noon
time when the whole world hangs
heavy with sweet odors.
And the snow: there has never!
been a palace, a temple, a garment,
or anything of man's handiwork
that matches the single Hake of I
snow.
Have you seen the rain? I like
the rain in my uplifted face. 1 live
on the mountain side in a little hut
- the one door open —it is open now.
Rain or shine, winter or summer,
that one door is open.
And the wind that walks arm in
arm with the great white rain; the
wind that comes from the four cor
ners of the earth. And the light
ning, chain on chain; and the won
derful thunder.
Let us go down to the earth
again. I would talk about the al-1
phabet of nature, and have gone!
past it. Pausing only to say, you j
shall not affect a lo\e of nature;
you must begin learning about it.
You may lie to every lover you
have, but you can not lit; to nature.
People say, We can not love na- j
ture, for we can not go and live ten
years on a mountain side, and it j
takes time to learn to love nature.
1 say to such people, if you give
one tenth of the time to studying!
books on nature that you spend on j
sensational literature and so-called
humorous papers, you will easily!
learn the alphabet of nature, and I
the rest is easy.
In our writings one tiling that
robs nature of her rights is the
superfluity of words. Burns wrote
in less than 4000, anil the Bible, i
such poetry as has not been since
written and can not be again, is
written in 7000 words. Milton
used 17,000, Shakspere 24,000,
and yet Webster boasted that his
dictionary contained nearly 200,-
000 words. At such a rate in less
than fifty years we will have more,
words than the Chinese, and fewer!
ideas. Our American schools are
far superior to England's, but our
general education is not. 1 want
to say to you who are going out
into the world to make money, as
we Americans are all taught to do,
there is a difference in the dollars
you may get. There are dollars
with dirt on them, dollars with
tears on them and even blood, dol
lars that you should not pick up
out of the road if to be had for the
taking; consider that well!
I want to impress upon you the
dignity of human toil. The laws!
of health demand toil. It is a mis- i
taken idea that the rich people of)
Europe are idle; they are the most!
industrious of people.
Tonight read the book of nature!
by the light of the stars —and by I
the first blush of light in the morn
ing. There is so much to read here
in California. Read as the Eng
lish read the book of nature. Re-1
member that we begin the next
life precisely where we left off in
this. Be not blinded to this beau-!
tiful world, but live and love it. 1

There are millions of tomorrows;
there is only one today.
Come listen, 0 love, to the voice of
the dove.
And hearken, and hear him say,
There are many tomorrows, my
love, my love,
There is only one today.
