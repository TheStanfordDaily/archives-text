Would it not be well for the stu
dent body to formulate some plans
fora celebration in case we win
the suit? In the general pande
monium that will immediately
break forth in the case of a favor
able decision, we will take no time
to formulate plans. On the other
hand, the preparation of an organ
ized program would add greatly to
the enjoyment of the occasion.
Let it not be understood from
this that we are entirely confident
of victory. When we say that we
expect the decision will be in favor
of this University, we are only
voicing the sentiment of this
country's best legal talent. The
student body as a whole is taking
a right view of the matter; our
men and women expect justice, and
are ready to abide uncomplain
ingly by the decision, be it for our
interests or against them. The
"law's delay" has been trying in
this case, but our. comfort now is
that there will be only a few more
days of waiting and hoping.
