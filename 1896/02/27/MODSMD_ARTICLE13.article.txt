The signs of renewed life dis
played by the Stanford Press Club,
which yesterday met and elected
its officers for the ensuing year,
are gratifying to such students as
expect to make journalism their
profession or feel an interest some
what more remote in the future of
the great Fourth Instate. Much
good can surely be accomplished
by a live, active club of this char
acter in our midst. There are a
hundred and one ways in which
such an organization, if properly
conducted, can confer inestimable
benefits on its members.
Perhaps one of the most hopeful
signs of the times, to those who de
sire the uplifting of newspaper
methods to a plane of greater de
cency and fairness, is that so many

j college-bred men are now drifting
into the ranks of journalism. With
| a larger leavening of trained and
I cultivated intelligence, the journal
j istie profession is no doubt destined
to become even more influential
and to occupy an even higher place
in the esteem of. all enlightened
communities than in the past.
Many faults of the present-day
newspaper will yield before the on
ward march of education and cul
ture —and before that alone. The
organization of press clubs and the
establishing of courses in journal
ism in the universities —all such
movements, indeed—are to be en
couraged. Perhaps our own Uni
versity may some day undertake
j the work of preparing for their life
vocations not only lawyers, teach
ers, etc., but journalists. Jn the
meantime there is a very prac
tical and equally important line of
work to which such an institution
as the Press Club can address it-*
