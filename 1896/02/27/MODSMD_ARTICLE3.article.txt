# Saturday's Baseball Game.
## 
### 
The interclass championship
game between '96 and '98, which
was to have taken place tomorrow,
has been postponed until next
week, on account of a practice game
to be played with the Santa Clara
College nine on Saturday. It was
feared that McLaine's arm would
be weakened by requiring him to
pitch both games.
The Santa Clara team is very
strong, and unless the Stanford
nine plays fine baseball it will be
defeated. At 2 p.m. the game is to
take place. An admission charge
of twenty-live cents will be made.
