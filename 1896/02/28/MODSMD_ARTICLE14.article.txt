The new feature which the Com
mittee on the Sophomore Cotillion
has decided to introduce this year,
in the shape of general buses for
the conveyance of the parties to the
dance, is one whose need has long
been felt but never sufficiently re
cognized, and the committee de
serves every commendation for the
stand it has taken in the matter.
There can be no doubt that our
hops, as they have heretofore been
conducted,have been run on an al
together too expensive scale. It has
not been the juice of the tickets
only, but the inordinately large
outlay for carriage hire or meansof
conveyance. Nearly every build
ing on our campus is so placed
that J,it lies almost in the_ imme
diate vicinity and within easy dis
tance of the gymnasium, in which
all of our dances are held, and
it certainly can not be deemed
a sacrifice for the young ladies
to be conveyed thither in other
than private carriages. In fact it
is well known that most of them
have wished and often requested
that no carriage at all be provided
for them, and consequently this
step will undoubtedly meet with
their hearty approval.
