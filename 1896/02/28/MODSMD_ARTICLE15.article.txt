As the semester progresses the
work on the Junior Annual must
he hastened. Delays in past years
have heen due as much to different
organizations which were slow in
getting their'matter or photographs
in as to any other cause. The man

| agement is anxious to have as few
delays in this regard as possible
| this year, and desires that a
l classes, clubs, and societies that ex-
I pect to get photographs taken for
the Annual should have them in
as early as possible. The Junior
Class itself is to have its photo
graph taken next Wednesday, and
every member of the class should
be on hand at the appointed time
to insure the success of the picture.
