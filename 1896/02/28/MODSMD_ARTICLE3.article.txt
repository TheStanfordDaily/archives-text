'98 will meet '9<> for the class
championship of the I'niversity.

It took ten innings of the hardest
playing ever seen on this campus,
and one inning of the hardest root
ing ever heard anywhere, to ac
complish this result. It was the
most exciting contest in the na
tional game that this University
has seen for many a long day.
Jeffs, Strohn, Taylor, and Whip
ple were mainly responsible for'9B's
victory, while Young, Montgomery,
and liuddell did the best work for
their side. Young fielded ground
balls well, as did Strohn. .Jeffs
catch of a foul in the ninth inning
was one of the prettiest plays seen
here. Taylor's stop of Young's hit
to short was also noticeable.
