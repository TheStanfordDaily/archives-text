# The 						Paderewski Concert.
## 
### 
No sale of seats on the campus
for many a day has equaled that
for the Paderewski recital which is
to take place tomorrow evening at
San Jose. In the "Garden City"
the rush for seats was even worse,
and there is no probability that a
single seat will remain unsold by
noon tomorrow. All those who
had ordered tickets reserved should
call and get them at once, for they
can not be held after Saturday
noon.
Those holding tickets on the
special train must be sure to catch
the (5:52 p.m. train, for the tickets
â– ire good for this train only.
