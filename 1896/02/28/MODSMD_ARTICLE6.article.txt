### 
The regular weekly lecture of the
Popular Science Course was de
livered by Mr. Everett M. Loomis
of the Academy of Sciences, his sub
ject being "Alexander Wilson, the
poet-naturalist." The following is
a brief abstract of the lecture:
In order to understand the char
acter of Alexander Wilson, one
must understand the times in which
he lived. The Seven Years' War,
the Napoleonic wars, our own Rev
olutionary War, and the beginning
of the War of 1812 encompass his
lifetime. The literary glory of Ad
dison, Pope, Scott, and Johnson,
and of that brilliant coterie of men,
was waning.
Not much is known of his early
life and education. At the age of
thirteen he was apprenticed for
three years to learn the trade of a
weaver, and when his apprentice
ship was over he continued at the
loom for four years as a journey
man. During his leisure hours he
endeavored to obtain culture by
reading and observation.
In 1794 he resolved to go to
America, and by living on otie
shilling a week managed to save
enough fora deck passage. Ar
rived in America, he supported
himself in various ways. His pur
suit of teaching led him to a study
of natural history and drawing.
He was also employed in editing
liee's "Cyclopedia." In 1804 he
made an expedition of 1200 miles
on foot, collecting material fora
book of American birds. The first
volume appeared in 1808, at the
unprecedented price of $120, and
the second volume in 1810. Hecon
tinued his great labors,and by 1813
the seventh volume of his great
'"Ornithology" had been published.
Intense and excessive labor weak
ened his constitution, and he died
in Philadelphia Aug. 23, 1813.
In person he was tall, handsome,
and vigorous. He possessed strong,
good sense, high moral worth, and
a sturdy independence. During
all his life he was a stranger to
dissipation. He was a careful ob
server, a lover of nature, an orig
inal thinker. His life was full of
poverty, toil, and privation; always
met with lofty courage, persever
ance, and determination. His style
as a writer was clear, natural, and
eloquent; and his book remains the
most complete work on American
Ornithology as well as being the
pioneer of its kind.
