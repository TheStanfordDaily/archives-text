A second dispatch froiu liinoihy

How the News Was Received.
At 11 :H() ih's morning the news
came through a bus*driver that
Mrs. Stanford had received a t'avor
ahie decision in her suit . This was
.
wildest enthusiasm. The students
in tile class-rooms were soon drawn
together hy shrill sounds of the
Stanford veil, given again and
aga.il as only I ova I i"-lantord stu
dent- can give our veil. The quad
thu-iasiie gathering which ever as
sembled under its arches. The
drums and cymbals of the Stanford
Band aided in making the quad
resound. A procession was tunned
which proceeded to the registrar s
<ifiiee and inquired for ['resident
Jordan and for confirmation of the
news. It was learned that Dr.
.Ionian wa - at his residence, and
that the news had been received
from Palo Alto announcing a
favorable decision.
The procession, headed by the
improvised band. proceeded towards
Dr. Jordan's residence. Professors,
co-eds, students, all were rejoicing,
each in a manner characteristic to
himself. The senior unbended his
dignity and gave forth lusty Stan
ford ralis: the junior surpassed the
senior in the breadth of his smiles,
and in the joy fulness* of his spirits;
sophomore and freshman, arm in
arm, furnished the climax of the
pandemonium.
Dr. Jordan was met at Ruble
Hall and was greeted with rousing
cheers. Dr. Jordan had not se
cured authentic news of the decision.
He said that lie had always ex
pected a favorable decision' and had
so often expressed hi-* sentiments
on the result that he did not wish
to ft take any speech until he had
ed Dr. Jordan to the registrar's
office where he might ascertain the

exact news received. An extem
pore meeting of the student body
and faculty was then held in the
chapel.
Mass-Meeting in the Chapel.
In a trice the chapel was crowded
as it ha- seldom if ever been before.
The scene was a truly inspiring
one. Hals, hand kerchiefs, um
brellas, everything not fastened
with buttons or nails, were waved
wildly in the air. while hundreds of
lusty voire-- 'united in salvo after

salvo of cheers, or rung musically
in the familiar strains of the Stan
ford yell. Hi" improvised band
added not a little to t lie din and
enthusiasm.
Presently Dr. .Jordan arrived,
and a soon as he was seen wedg
ing hi ■ way towards the platform,
the spirits of the great surging au
dience burst all bounds. Cheer
after cheer went up, and it was sev
eral miniucs before the President
eould speak.
i)r. Jordan began by humor
em!v remarking that the Supreme
Court judges had commissioned
Justice Harlan to make known
their decision, that he had done so
fifteen minutes ago, and that it
was receive'l bv telepathy at the
i Diversity. He had no official in
timation oi the judgment and could
not speak of facts, but this enthu
siasm Was what he expected. He

had always believed that sooner or
later the result would be in our fa
vor. In their enthusiasm the stu
dents should not-forget Mrs. Stan
ford, who had sacrificed more tluin
any one else* -who " for the past
three years had suffered-and waited
in patience, as no one but herself
j could understand. Without any
; great resources, without any mil
lions of her own to draw upon, she
had supported-the t niversity dur
ing the darkest hours. Her oppor
tunity to do good has been greater
than that of Any other woman, and
few understood how i'aithfuily she
had carried out her trust.

Mr. Sheldon on stepping forward
was greeted with • cheers, and

shook hands with the Presi
dent in congratulation. He ex
pressed his joy il the victory of
of which 1 hey had all been so con
fident, and which wa- now assured.
The students should celebrate the
event in a fitting mama r. and with
this end in view the Executive
(■ommittee would meet at the close
J of the meeting. The arrangements
i for the celebration would be an
nounced in the afternoon. \\ bile
j not officially qualified to make such
iin announcement, he believed he
could state on the authority of
what Dr. Jordan had stated a
month ago, that there w< uld be a
vacation and that the students
could do anything but tear down
the.buildings or pai nt the jtrofe- sors.
A motion was made to take U|> a
collection to defray the expenses of
the celebration, and it wa finally
decided to collect at the doors <>l

the chapel. President Sheldon ap

man who hud done much "to bring
about the present victory, and who
should not be forgotten. lie pro
posed three eiieers for Joseph

The proportion met with a hearty
reception three rout-raising cheers
being given.
Not less enthusiastic was the res
ponse to President Sheldon's call
for cheer- for I>r. Jordan and Mi-.'
Stanford.
Then it was proposed that "Hail

the glorious old air rung forth
from hundreds of voiocs with mi
enthusiasm and vigor that lias
never been surpassed,

Crowds of -chool children from
Palo Alto and Mayfield attracted

No one seemed to give a thought
to the morrow's lessons, but en
joyed himself just as though Presi
dent Sheldon had been really
authorized to announce the week's
vacation, which he thought we
: might possibly get.

The iown of Palo Alto was not
behind the University itself in the
promptitude with which aminge
menis were made for celebrating
th' 1 great event. After the first
rumor arri\ed, the main street of
tin' bustling little town was de
corated in short order with hun
dreds in small flags, streamers, and
other outward signs of rejoicing.
Everyone wore smiles of gladness,
and eongratulat iom were exchanged
as freely at on the quad. Ihe
Palo Alto business man recognizes
that tins decision means much
indeed all for the future of the
town, and tonight there will be as
much genuine rejoicing among the
property holders of Palo Alto as
there is among the professors and
students of the University.
During the afternoon there was
a steady stream of promenaders
about the quad all, no doubt, dis
cussing the same thing. The ap
pearance was as of a general hoi i
dav though no one appeared to for
get the great celebration in store
for the evening.
ISone of the fourth hour classes
met thi- morning owing to the re
ceipt of the news.
