I he Sophomore < 'otillion ('om
111i 11e< has decided to provide a new
feature lor .the dance this year,
and one that is well worthy of in
troduction. The plan is at* follows:
covered buses and carriages are to
he provided for gathering up and
taking the parties to Encina gym
nasium and afterwards conveying
them home. The committee is to
ha ve sole charge of the luises, a-nd
upon applica t ion to a n.y of its mem
bers will have them call at any
address, provided that these ad
dresses are limited to Palo Alto,
Maylield, and thecamjms. Onlv a
nominal price will be charged for
this conveyance, the bare cost alone
being estimated, and it will be col
lected by t he commit tee.
This step was taken in' order to
decrease ii possible the unnecessar
ily large expense which has hereto
fore attached to these dances. A
great many have been kept awav
from these dances for this reason,
and ii all resolve to go together in
large buses there is no reason why
the project can not be carried
tliTough and"the cost of the dance
materially lessened.
