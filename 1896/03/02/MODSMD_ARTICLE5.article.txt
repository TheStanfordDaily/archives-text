The result is one in which the
I Diversity lias a right to take
great satisfaction. The decision
represents the conclusion of not
merely one judge, hut of one judge
in the District Court, three in the
Circuit Court of Appeals, and as I
understand, a unanimous court at
Washington, or thirteen judges in
all. Such harmony of opinion
among the best judges of llie I nited
States after argument by compet
ent attorneys, ought to satisfy can
did minds that it is time that liti
gation was at an end, and that the
Stanford estate had its own. How
ever, i.l is not possible to say
whether any efforts will be made to
take further proceeding on an
amended bill, but it would seem as
though the tloverninent could not
feel justified in incurring further
expense or in hindering the .de
velopment of the University in
view of such a long list of unani
mous federal judges opposed to
its claim.
DR. ORltlN L. ELLIOTT.
The triumph of Mrs. Stanford is
a crushing legal defeat for the (iov
ernment and demonstrates the
folly or worse of the initial action
of Mr. Secretary Olney. But this
aspect of the case is now of no im
portance. The triumph of Mrs.
Stanford is the triumph of the Un
iversity and of the Stanford Uni
versity idea. It means that the
inspiration of Leland Stanford Jr..
embodied in the splendid concep
tion of {jenator Stanford, wrought
into such noble material form in
the quadrangle, and made alive by
the enthusiastic co-operation of
founders, faculty, and students,
shall suffer no impairment. It
means that the heroic, self-sacrifice
of Mrs. Stanford shall not fail of
its fruition. It means that the fair
outlines of a great university so
broadly and so firmly laid by i'res
ident Jordan shall suffer no
eeli jise.
For the future it means growth
along the lines already laid out. to
include all departments properly
identified with a university, new
buildings, libraries, enlarged Labor
atories, additional instructors, and
greatly increased numbers of stu
dents.
The final settlement of the suit
does not at once release the estate
from the Probate"Court. No sud
den allluence is likely to beset the
University. But the future is se
cure. And with a prospective en
dowment greater than that which
any university now enjoys, with
scholarly traditions, high ideals,
and fearless liberty in the truth, it
is reasonable to believe that the
University will realize all that its
friends have ever dared hope.

The building of Stanford Uni
versity has made a great change in
Santa Clara valley. I have- lived
in this valley since 1SS7. When I
came here a large majority of the
people did not realize what a uni
versity was or what higher educa
tion meant. Even if Senator Stan
had only put up these buildings,
that alone would have a very bene
ficial and educative influence. No
where in this country have I seen
anything to match their beauty. 1
am glad to know that Stanford
University is going to continue to
hold her high place in the educa
tional world.
PROF. E. A. ROSS.
Now that the future of the Uni
versity is absolutely assured we
will be quite content to endure
whatever economy may still he

necessary before the material expan
sion of the University begins.
What we have been needing is not
so much more instructors and
more buildings, but the assurance
that what we do will have a contin
uous life in the future of the Uni
versity. Now that this is assured,
let us pull together in doing such
work, initiating such student insti
tutions and observances as shall
befit one of the coining universities
of the world.

The rejoicing is fitting, bu't the
appreciation of what has happened

has been a foregone conclusion al
most from the lirst. There never
was any chance of the (iovernment
suit injuring the Stanford estate.
But there was a chance, almost a
certainty, of its ruining the Stan
ford I' diversity. If the (iovernment
could not get the money, it could

tic it i!)i, which meant the same
thing to us, for the present at least.
I he suit has dragged its slow length
along (juite enough to have wearied
an ordinary patience and battled;
a 11 ordinary heroism. We do not
owe our salvation to the Supreme j
Court. They have but affirmed
an easy principle and recorded
another legal commonplace. We
owe our existence (for even tem
porary closure would have meant
ruin)to the extraordinary ability
and undaunted purpose of Mrs.
Stanford. We should rejoice be
cause her efforts have been crowned
with success and her anxieties are
at an end. Shall it ail end in a
"Hah, Rah, Kali." and a feast and
a racket, or shall it leave with us
all as a supreme purpose the de
sire to justify her efforts in our be-

When the Class of '98 entered
the University this institution was
in the midst of its adversity. We
feel proud that we have passed
through two years of the darkest
days this University will ever see,
and we rejoice that there still re
mains for us two years in which to
enjoy its prosperity. We all hope
that in our two remaining years
we may see Stanford University
well on the way toward becoming
the greatest, as today it has become
the richest, university in America.

and we rejoice that there still re
mains for us two years in which to
enjoy its prosperity. We all hope
that in our two remaining years
we may see Stanford University
well on the way toward becoming
the greatest, as today it has become
the richest, university in America.

The Class of 'I)'.) probably holds
the most unique position in the
' University, as it is the last class
that entered during the period of
anxiety and hardship. During its
short stay the Freshman ('lass has
always shown great loyalty and
love for Stanford; and now as the
period of prosperity is dawning,
this spirit will ever confine and in
crease.

PROF. NATHAN ABBOTT.
The result is one in which the
I Diversity lias a right to take
great satisfaction. The decision
represents the conclusion of not
merely one judge, hut of one judge
in the District Court, three in the
Circuit Court of Appeals, and as I
understand, a unanimous court at
Washington, or thirteen judges in
all. Such harmony of opinion
among the best judges of llie I nited
States after argument by compet
ent attorneys, ought to satisfy can
did minds that it is time that liti
gation was at an end, and that the
Stanford estate had its own. How
ever, i.l is not possible to say
whether any efforts will be made to
take further proceeding on an
amended bill, but it would seem as
though the tloverninent could not
feel justified in incurring further
expense or in hindering the .de
velopment of the University in
view of such a long list of unani
mous federal judges opposed to
its claim.
DR. ORltlN L. ELLIOTT.
The triumph of Mrs. Stanford is
a crushing legal defeat for the (iov
ernment and demonstrates the
folly or worse of the initial action
of Mr. Secretary Olney. But this
aspect of the case is now of no im
portance. The triumph of Mrs.
Stanford is the triumph of the Un
iversity and of the Stanford Uni
versity idea. It means that the
inspiration of Leland Stanford Jr..
embodied in the splendid concep
tion of {jenator Stanford, wrought
into such noble material form in
the quadrangle, and made alive by
the enthusiastic co-operation of
founders, faculty, and students,
shall suffer no impairment. It
means that the heroic, self-sacrifice
of Mrs. Stanford shall not fail of
its fruition. It means that the fair
outlines of a great university so
broadly and so firmly laid by i'res
ident Jordan shall suffer no
eeli jise.
For the future it means growth
along the lines already laid out. to
include all departments properly
identified with a university, new
buildings, libraries, enlarged Labor
atories, additional instructors, and
greatly increased numbers of stu
dents.
The final settlement of the suit
does not at once release the estate
from the Probate"Court. No sud
den allluence is likely to beset the
University. But the future is se
cure. And with a prospective en
dowment greater than that which
any university now enjoys, with
scholarly traditions, high ideals,
and fearless liberty in the truth, it
is reasonable to believe that the
University will realize all that its
friends have ever dared hope.
PROF. BRUN.
The building of Stanford Uni
versity has made a great change in
Santa Clara valley. I have- lived
in this valley since 1SS7. When I
came here a large majority of the
people did not realize what a uni
versity was or what higher educa
tion meant. Even if Senator Stan
had only put up these buildings,
that alone would have a very bene
ficial and educative influence. No
where in this country have I seen
anything to match their beauty. 1
am glad to know that Stanford
University is going to continue to
hold her high place in the educa
tional world.
PROF. E. A. ROSS.
Now that the future of the Uni
versity is absolutely assured we
will be quite content to endure
whatever economy may still he

necessary before the material expan
sion of the University begins.
What we have been needing is not
so much more instructors and
more buildings, but the assurance
that what we do will have a contin
uous life in the future of the Uni
versity. Now that this is assured,
let us pull together in doing such
work, initiating such student insti
tutions and observances as shall
befit one of the coining universities
of the world.
PROF. II. II. POWERS.
The rejoicing is fitting, bu't the
appreciation of what has happened
does not seem to me to he adequate
nor wholly correct. '1 he decision
has been a foregone conclusion al
most from the lirst. There never
was any chance of the (iovernment
suit injuring the Stanford estate.
But there was a chance, almost a
certainty, of its ruining the Stan
ford I' diversity. If the (iovernment
could not get the money, it could

tic it i!)i, which meant the same
thing to us, for the present at least.
I he suit has dragged its slow length
along (juite enough to have wearied
an ordinary patience and battled;
a 11 ordinary heroism. We do not
owe our salvation to the Supreme j
Court. They have but affirmed
an easy principle and recorded
another legal commonplace. We
owe our existence (for even tem
porary closure would have meant
ruin)to the extraordinary ability
and undaunted purpose of Mrs.
Stanford. We should rejoice be
cause her efforts have been crowned
with success and her anxieties are
at an end. Shall it ail end in a
"Hah, Rah, Kali." and a feast and
a racket, or shall it leave with us
all as a supreme purpose the de
sire to justify her efforts in our be-
I half?
I'ROF. KARL r.ARXKS.
i Stanford I'niversity represents
I an endowment nearly or quite
j equal to the amount of money that
i the State of California has invested
j in elementary education. Suppose
(that during these past months the
, fate of all the primary and grammar
schools of California had been hang

ingin the ha lance,what would he the
feeling in the state when the decis
ion was announced securing their
perpetuity? During these past five
years our University has done a
great work in building up all the
branches of state education in Cali
fornia. The people of our state
recognize this, and over a thousand
miles of valley lying along the
Pacific, the people will breathe a
sigh of relief that the suit is done
and Stanford University i> secured
to the world forever. With mil
j lions of money, the devotion of the
woman who has so nobly struggled
to complete the work her husband
began, and with the love and con
fidence of a people around us, lie
who does not dream dreams today
must have small stock of that
quality which makes this human
world with constant aspirations to
ward the Divine.
PROF. E. M. PEASE.
Every one interested in the cause

of education and in the develop
ment of California will join with us
in celebrating this final victory.
This decision means more for the
intellectual, moral, and even ma
terial advancement of this Coast
than our friends, the newspapers,
have ever dreamed of. Now with
a broad foundation, ample resour
ces, and the best spirit that ever
pi-evaded an institution of learning,
we shall see this I'niversitv become
one of the most influential institu
tions in the land. May it be the
privilege of Mrs. Stanford, whom
we congratulate today, to witness
the full realization of her plans.
PROF. M. B. ANDKItSON. '
I think that the matter was first
settled by Judge Ross. Thai was
the turning point in its history,
but today will be remembered a
thousand years from now as a
great historic day.
PROF. J. M. STJLLM AN.
There is absolutely, as far as
1 know, no positive information in
regard to the decision of the Su
preme Court, hut if it has been
given in our favor I hardly know
how to express myself. 1 have been

holding myself so long in suspense
that it is hurt! to give an adequate
opinion of what's what.

HENRY 1). SHELDON,
President of Student Body.
Stanford University was foundetl
as a national institution. For
three years it has heen an open
question whether the realiza
tion of the founders'purpose was
within the hounds of possibilities.
The uncertainty exists no longer.
1 lenceforth there will be one institu
tion of learning of the first class
between the Mississippi and the
Pacific, and that institution will be
Stanford University. The mem
bers of the student body are san
guine of the future. The complete
harmony of students and faculty
wast he most pleasing a ltd emphatic
feature of the celebration. Stan
ford is preeminently a students' uni
versity; they felt that the victory
was their victory, the future be
longs to t hem.
R. L. WILBUR,
President oj !)0.
The Class of has seen today
; the greatest day in its history.
We are the only, class that has
see the complete history of the Uni
versity from the day of Senator
Stanford's death, and it has been
instilled deep into our hearts an
undying Stanford loyalty, that can
ilot find expression even on a day
like this. We have been told that
we might be the last Stanford grad
uating class, but we now see our
selves only as one of the most
worthy of the many that will bear
the name of Stanford down to
posterity. *1 think I am speaking
I for every member of t he class when
1 say, '• "VMS aifd Stanford forever.
CHRIS HENNE,
I'reside nt of 'U7.
Now let us rejoice! The climax
for which we have been waiting for
so patiently has come at last.
Brighter da.vs open before the Uni
versity and the .Junior Class unites
with all students in common
thanksgiving. We have struggled
against adverse circumstances and
at last we are free. Every member
of "'.>7 feels grateful to the noble
woman who has sacrificed her com
fort and personal resources for
three years past that the University
; might continue, bet every student
stand by the University now and
forever and continue to shout for
the Cardinal.
STEWART W. COTTON,
