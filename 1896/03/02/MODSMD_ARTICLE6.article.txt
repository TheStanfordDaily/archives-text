# THE 						CONCERT IN SAN JOSE.
## A 						Financial Success—Crowds Turned Away From the Door. 
### 
Probably the most notable mu
sical event that has happened in!
San Jose for some time was the l'ad
erewski concert given in that city j
Saturday evening under Stanford;
Pniversity auspices. Long before!
the time for the doors to open a!
large crowd had collected outside
the Auditorium, waiting for ad- 1
mission, and when linally the doors
were thrown open such a rush was j
made for seats as to tax to the ut-1
most the abilities of the doorkeep
ers.
The special trains bearing the |
Stanford students left Palo Alto at !
(5:55 and 7:05 p.m. respectively,
and arrived in San Jose in good!
time for the concert. The cars I
were packed with people and many
had to remain outside on the plat
form.
Through unavoidable delays the
concert did not begin as promptly'
as usual. The extraordinarily!
large crowd made it a difficult mat-1
ter for the ushers to handle it prop
erly and it, was fully nine o'clock I
before Paderewski stepped on the >
stage to begin his concert. Viewed j
from the stage the audience was a |
most brilliant and fashionable one. |
Every seat from top to bottom of |
the large building was occupied l
and with the elite of the commun
ity. Crowds who applied for stand
ing room only were turned away
from the doors, as the contract I
with Paderewski's manager re-1
quired that everything in the hall !
should be as quiet as possible.
Concerning Paderewski's playing
so much has been said that but
little mention will be required
here. Suffice to say that his play
ing was received with the most en
thusiastic applause and numerous
encores were responded to with lib
erality. The audience was com
posed largely of people who love
and know music, and the charms of
the great pianist's playing were
quickly seen and appreciated, j
During the selections the most, in
tense quiet prevailed throughout
the large house, everyone listen
ing intently to catch the faintest |
sounds of the far away piano, j
Paderewski himself said after the!
concert, that it was one of the most j
attentive audiences that he has
ever appeared before.
After all expenses and guaran-|
ties have been deducted, the pro-1
ceeds of the evening's entertain
ment will probably yield about j
•$2OO net to the Associated Students.
Considering the nature of the enter
tainment and the immense guar
antee required, this i> a most satis
factory result, and those who, by
their energy and wise arrange
ments, contributed to this outcome,
have reason to feel proud of their
venture.
The special train bearing the
Stanford students home left San
Jose immediately after the concert,
and reached Palo Alto about 11
p.m.
