### 
The Freshman baseball team left
j early Saturday morning for Bel
! Mont, where it met and defeated
the Belmont School team. A num
ber of buses were chartered for the
use of those who wished to see the
game, and quite a few students
went up to "root" for the freshmen.
The game was a good one, though
but seven innings were played,
some of the Stanford players hav
ing to return 'to the campus in
time for the afternoon game, which,
however, was postponed. The score
was 7t06 in Stanford's favor. In
batting, honors were about evenly
divided, but the individual play
ing of the Stanford freshmen was
I superior to that of their opponents.
