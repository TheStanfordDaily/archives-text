# The
						Supreme Court Decision.
## 
### 
On Monday, March 2. Mrs. Stan
ford received the first favorable de
cision in the suit of the United
States against her. .Justice Harlan
delivered the decision for the
Supreme Court, and his decision
followed closely the lines laid down
by Judge Ross in the Circuit Court.
Mrs. Stanford's attorney, Joseph R.
Choate, was present.
Justice Harlan in bis decision
held that individual stockholders
were not liable for the (government
debt of the Central Pacific Hail
way Company. The Congressional
acts of P v o2, I<S(»4, and l<S6f> re
garding the Pacific Railroads must
be construed as one law, as the ob
ject was the construction of one
continuous line, Congress employ
ing the different railway companies
as instruments. Security was given
by the Government mortgages. If
individual stockholders bad been
made personally liable, the purpose
of Congress to secure a national
highway would have been seriously
interfered with ; and we find that
none of the Pacific Railroad acts
contained any clause imposing
upon the stockholders of corpor
ations receiving subsidy personal
liability if said corporations did
not pay the bonds at maturity.
No liability was imposed upon
the stockholders of the Union
Pacific Railroad, and no evidence
can be found in the legislation
of Congress which confirms the
theory that Congress intended to
take a larger security in respect to
that corporation than of the Union
Pacific.
Throughou'. the whole of these
Acts the purpose is manifest that
the California corporation should
enjoy the same rights, privileges,
and immunities given to it upon
the same terms as were prescribed
to the Union Pacific.
.Justice Harlan particularly
stated that the question whether
the stockholders of the California
company can be made liable for its
debts to the United States in some
other way than under the Pacific
Road Acts or by the acceptance of
its bonds in aid of the construction
of its road, is not involved in the
case. "Nor are we to decide
whether the adoption of the Cali
fornia company as an instrument
of the national Government in ac
complishing a national object ex
empted ils stockholders from lia
bility ui.der the Constitution and
laws of California to ordinary con
ditions.'' The question related
only "to the liability of the stock
holders of the California corpora
tion, on account of the claim of the
Pn i ted States arising out of the par
lieu la r Acts of Congress which au
thorized the issuing of bonds to
that corporation, and made provis
ions for the security of the United
Slates, which Congress deemed
proper but which did not provide
for the personal liability of stock
holders."
All the above condensed state
ments were strengthened and forti
fied by quotations from the Acts of
Congress and from the decisions of
the Supreme Court.
In conclusion the decision said:
"The relations between the Cali
fornia corporation and State were
of no concern to the national Gov

eminent at the time the purpose
was formed to establish a great
highway across the continent for
governmental and public use.
Congress chose this existing artifi
cial being as instrumental to ac
complish national ends, and the re
lations between the United States
and that corporation ought to be
determined by the enactments
which established those relations;
and if those enactments do not ex
pressly, nor by implication, sub
ject the stockholders of such cor
porations to liability for its debts,
it is to be presumed that Congress
intended to waive its right to im
pose such liability.
"The views we have expressed
render it unnecessary to consider
any other question in the case.
We are of opinion that the bill
filed by the United States was
properly dismissed, and that the
order of the Circuit Court of Ap
peals affirming such dismissal was
correct.
'•.Judgment is therefore affirmed."
According to Judge McKisiek of
San Francisco, as the case was de
cided by the unanimous judgment
of the eight justices who heard it, a
rehearing csin be secured only if
one or more of the justices changes
his mind. This is improbable,
and this decision closes the Stan
ford suit.
