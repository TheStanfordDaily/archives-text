# Monday Night's Celebration.

### 
Stanford's greatest clay is over.
One tiling only was lacking to
ninke the occasion perfect—- the
state of the weather. All day long
a gusty, drizzling rain fell, and a
cold wind came down from the
snowy hills; hut a blizzard could
never have chilled the enthusiasm
of the happy students who gathered
for the evening's jollification.
]>y seven o'clock the quadrangle
was fairly packed by the enthusias
tic population of the University
and vicinity. They brought their
Stanford colors, their football horns,
their brass bands—in short, every
conceivable noise machine.
The women of the University
were there also, as happy as the
men, if not quite so noisy.
The crowd fell into line and
marched twice around the quad
rangle and turned at length to
ward the gymnasium, which was
soon packed. President Sheldon
of the Associated Students pre
sided and introduced each speaker
with appropriate remarks.
Dr. Jordan was the first speaker
to address the assemblage. In sub
stance he spoke as follows:
"Friends and students: You may
not have noticed it, but I have
made my speech while you were
yelling. I believe this is not the
second time 1 have spoken today.
I have spoken very many times
since the news was received.
"For three years we have been un
der a cloud. One gets used to that
kind of thing, and 1 more than any
one else, because J was a college
president leading a forlorn hope.
Senator Stanford once said he
thought J made a better president
at Stanford than J would at Har
vard.
"Then, too, 1 had made up my
mind to linish up my college ca
reer in a picturesque way. Down
in San Antonio there was an old
padre who sold tiles and geese, and
J had made up my mind to flood
the quadrangle here, live all alone,
and sell tiles from the chapel roof
and geese, like the old padre; but
this hope is now banished. 1 was
going to say something about the
way in which these three years
have solidified us —how they have
given us strength and hope for the
future. 1 think all of us can feel
what this must mean to the woman
who has waited for so long a time
for this result.
" What a lesson in self-devotion
that must be, in order, as Mr.
Stanford once said, 'that the cliil
dren of California shall be my chil
dren.' (Then cheers was given for
Mrs. Stanford.) And now that is
all 1 have to say tonight."
Mrs. Stanford was not present,
but the following letter was read
from her :
To the Students: I can not re
frain from saying that 1 am pro
foundly thankful to the ministers
of the law at their just decision,
and 1 thank you one and all for
your loyally throughout the past
year of doubt and uncertainty, and
now you can rejoice to your hearts'
content, while 1 will remain at
home and be thankful. Yours,
always, Jank L. Stanford.
San Francisco, Cal., March 2.
Prof. 10. A. Ross spoke as the
representative of the faculty, say

ing thnt he presumed he was chosen
to represent the faculty because he
went further up. "The great hope
of the future is not simply that
this decision shall put us beyond
economics, it is the assurance that
this work will last. This is now
the plastic period in the history of
the institution. Future students
find the life laid down in grooves.
There is the finest student initia
tive among the students, and this is
a warrant that you will go on and
build for the future."
L. J. Hinsdill was introduced to
speak for the Class of '95. He
said that he would rather speak
for the whole University. "This
time marks the beginning of our
real career as a University. We
have struggled on for three years;
many times the skies lowered and
if it had not been for Dr. Jordan
with his words of cheer to the stu
dents, it is impossible to foresee
what might have happened. This
case was decided upon the law and
not upon sentiment. In his plea
before the justices of the Supreme
Court Mr. Choate begged them to
decide the case simply upon the
law.
"In this hour we should not for
get our many friends. We have
them all throughout the United
States. On this coast we should
remember Timothy Hopkins who
has been our firm and loyal friend.
Then the trustees who have stood
firmly by us. And lastly Dr.
Jordan who has been Mrs. Stan
ford's firmest friend."
H. 11. Brown, speaking for the
Class of '96, said that to be present
in Stanford University, to be a
part of it, and to feel the joy of
his jubilee, was a feeling of a life
time. "One thing more remains,
to let eastern colleges know the
stuff we are made of by beating
Berkeley on the track this year.
It has been said of Stanford Uni
versity that we have no tradition,
that we were not born, but came
into the world full grown. Hut
see what three years have done.
As your spokesman 1 conclude
with a tribute to that great soul
tempered with fire —Mrs. Stanford."
Burton 31. Palmer, for theJunior
Class, read a poem entitled "Vic
tory." The poem was especially
prepared for the occasion and
evoked prolonged applause for its
author.
After the speech making was over
the throng hastened back to the
quadrangle and watched the dis
play of fire-works. After this
those whose nervous force had
not been worn out by continuous
excitement followed the residents
of Palo Alto to the University
town, where the jollification was
kept uj> far into the wee sma'
hours.
