The expressions of good will and
the Hood of congratulatory tele
grams which have poured in since
the linal decision was rendered,
bear witness of the esteem in which
l
this University is held. From all
over the United States words of
thankfulness and pleasure are re
ceived, and if we may judge from
these, our friends are legion. We
can therefore look forward to a fu-;
ture such as no other educational
institution in the world can con
template. Our student body has
become united through our past ad
versity into a closer bond of com
radeship and sentiment than is I
usual at like institutions. We I
have a vast endowment fully as- j
sured; an endowment which far ex- !
ceeds that of Harvard, Vale, or ;
even Berlin University. At the ;
head of our faculty we have a I
strong, progressive, watchful presi-j
dent, who is even now in the prime;
of his manhood, and who, never
theless, has made himself famous I
by bis scientific and practical work.'
About President Jordan is grouped;
a faculty corps of comparatively
young men whose names are al-1
ready renowned through their work
in their various specialties. Last,
but not least, our patroness is at
last able to carry out her own and
her husband's colossal project, and
we are able to show her the appre
ciation and gratitude we have for
her.
