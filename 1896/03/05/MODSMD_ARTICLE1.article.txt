# "IMMORTALITY."
## An Address by Dr. Wilbur W. Thoburn. 
### 
The human mind has always
held a belief in immortality. Men!
are always asking, (Jan it he that'
we are to live hereafter? Kromj
time immemorial this question has
been propounded, and there have
always heen those who believed i
that there was a life hereafter.
There is reason for this belief.
There is always a reason for doubt.
Manv books have attempted to
prove the immortality <>t" man by
carrying analogies of the physical
world over into the world of the
spirit. But none of these can bring
peace. Immortality is a spiritual
fact. It belongs to the same realm
that love does and can be weighed
no more than love can be weighed.
Our bodies are constantly raising
the question of immortality. There
belief and doubt have met —belief
in continual existence and doubt
of its possibility. Some held that
there was no such thing as matter;
others that there was no such tiling
as spirit. I believe neither extreme
is right. I recognize the supremacy
of mind over matter, and yet this
supremacy is limited. But immor
tality can not be mathematically
demonstrated. I pon this question
science is agnostic —which is just
another way of saying that science
is honest. The evidence proving
immortality is out of the realm of
science. Only with the immortal
ity of the body has science to do.
I in* question can never be proved
nor disproved by any analysis or
test known to science. If you hope
by studying nature to find ab
solute proof of immortality, you
will he disappointed. Immortality
does not stand upon scientific
grounds. It depends upon ele
ments of character, and these have
no place in the laboratory.
People have been led to reject
immortality as a truth, and to re
gard it as a. sentiment. They say,
even though science says there is
no such thing as immortality, I
will feel and believe that there is.
But such a belief can not serve as a
working basis for life. It is pos
sible to produce a state of seeming
health by the use of drugs, but it is
an unreal thing and can not serve
as a basis for work.
\\ hat did Christ say regarding
iin mortality? We have turned to
science she offers no proof, she of
fers no barrier. Faith built upon
philosphy we have also found to
be insufficient. Now how did
('hri.-t, with his keen insight into
nature, view immortality? In
-( arching his word we find that he
offers no proof, but simply treats it
as a thing to be assumed. Life
was so real to him that the possi
bility of its ending did not enter
his mind, lb l made no distinction
between spiritual and temporal
things. Heaven to him was a con
dition of things that might be real
ized upon earth. Now is the day
of judgment. In spite of the mis
use of his teachings, that myster
ious kingdom of heaven was not to
be let down from heaven, but is
now. Christ waited no time try
ing to settle things by reason,
things that can not be settled by
reason. He simply assumed that
man was immortal.

But, you will say, assumption is
not truth. Yes, it is. Assume
tiiat man is immortal, and he will
be so. What we call life is not
merely a stretch of three score
years and ten. In fact, we must
break away from this life and go
up higher before we really begin to
live. The higher powers of man,
such as love and benevolence, are
then awakened into activity, and it
is these that constitute spiritual
life; it is these that are eternal;
these are the life immortal. If we
can move up into the higher realm
we shall be immortal. And love
alone can lift man out of the ma
terial into the spiritual. We are
ourselves only when we love —
when we forget It is a
law that we have nothing until we
have given it away. Wisdom and
power are all vain until they are
turned into love. Perfect altruism
lifts man above the physical where
death reigns, and places him in
the spiritual where there is life
everlasting.
