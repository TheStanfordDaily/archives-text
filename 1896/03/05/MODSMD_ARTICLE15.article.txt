Amuuosk Bikhce, the brilliant
journalist who writes about every
thing that comes within the sweep

of his all-inclusive intelligence,
with a pen dipped in gall and
sharpened 1»y a malignant pugnac
ity, sees tit in his Washington dis
patch to yesterday's Examiner to
sneer at Judge Harlan and the
other justices of the Supreme Court
on the head of their decision in
the Stanford suit. Inuendo is the
cheapest and meanest of weapons—
resorted to only when no other is
to he had.
The friends of Stanford can af
ford to smile, however, at all such
attempts as Mr. Bierce's to weaken
the significance of Monday's great
victory. The spectacle of Mr.
Bierce assailing, even covertly, the
integrity and impartiality of the
I'nited States judiciary reminds
one of an ant's attempt to stiug an
elephant. When all the journalists
of San Francisco together are for
gotten as entirely as last year's
rains, the reputation of the Su
preme Court will remain as it is
now that of the most august, im
partial, and fearless tribunal in the
world.
