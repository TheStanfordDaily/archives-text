Since the decision in the Stan
lord case has ended favorably for]
j us scores of editorials have ap
peared in as many newspapers, and
j generally of a congratulatory na
ture. Among the most conipli
i mentary are those in the Los An
j geles EsprcsH, the San .Jose Mercury,
San Francisco Chronicle, and one
i from the S;in Francisco Cull, which
we reproduce in full, as it displays,
i in hrief, the friendly feeling towards
this University which exists in
1 many newspaper offices :
"The Supreme Court has acted
with unusual promptness in the
Stanford case, and by a decision af
firming the judgment of the lower
i courts has decided that the estate
I of Leland Stanford is not liable for
i any portion of the debt due to the
Government by the Central Pacific
Railroad Company. This decision
j closes the case, and the Govern
ment has no further recourse orap
peal.
'"As the result of the decision will
be to relieve the great University
founded by Leland Stanford and
i Mrs. Stanford from any danger of
losing so large a portion of its rev
enues as was sued for by the Gov
ernment, the news of the decision
will be received with complaisance
by the great majority of Califor
nians. The University was founded
and endowed for the benefit of Cal
ifornia, and h.is already proved its
great usefulness in the cause of ed
ucation. The decision is virtually
a decree in favor of the people, al
though in express terms it declares
1 against them, and there is good
reason fora general sympathy with
i the rejoicing that prevails at I'alo
| Alto.
"The Stanford estate has long
since ceased to be private properly
in anything more thai; in mime.
Under the management of a noble
woman who now directs it all, its
I revenues pass to the service of the
: University and through the influ
ence of that institution to the St:itc
i at large. The advancement at
I'alo Alto, which has been some
what checked by the suit brought
by the Government, will now goon
without further hindrance. That
the University is destined to be
come in the near future one of the

greatest seats of learning in the
world none can question, and in
contemplating the magnificent
plan upon which the foundations
were laid, the broad system of edu
cation designed to he carried out,
and the potent influence it is cer
tain to exert in the upbuilding of
the true grandeur of the State,
there will surely come to all a sense
of gratification with the knowledge
that the estate is not to be shorn of
any part of its great proportions,
but will remain for all time as an
endowment to carry out the will of
the munificent founder."
