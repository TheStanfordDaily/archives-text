# The 						Concert Last Night.
## 
### 
Only ;i fair sized audience greeted
the (.Jlee and Mandolin Clubs on
their appearance last night in the
chapel. It has been customary in
the past for the clubs to play to
crowded houses, especially when:
appearing on the campus, and the
unfortunate date selected for tlie j
event undoubtedly explains the!
comparatively small audience of i
last night. However, those who
did attend were very enthusiastic,
every number on the program re- i
eeiving an encore, and in some
cases several recalls were given.
Following is the complete pro
gram:

On the whole the program was,
very acceptably rendered and criti
cism must be confined to details.
Both clubs might profitably give
closer attention to these. Un
seemly long waits between numbers
should be avoided, and a closer re
gard for stage appearances would
create a much better impression.
The work of both clubs was a little i
uneven, and particularly so of the j
Mandolin Club. The excellent j
condition of the (ilee Club was an
agreeable surprise. The men, how
ever, need more unity and evenness
in their singing. Uniformity is
badly needed by both clubs. There
is little or no excuse for the ragged
work of the Mandolin Club in be
ginning pieces. With this possible
exception the work of the club was
up to its usual high standard.
The opening piece, "Estudian
tina,"â€¢given by both clubs, is a
very appropriate introduction and!
was exceptionally well rendered.
Of the three numbers given by j
the (ilee Club the "Medley" was
undoubtedly the best as a whole, j
though parts of "Old Kentucky
Home" were sung with more ex
pression. In the latter piece, how
ever, there was not that evenness
that characterized the "Medley."!
The humorous selections by the j
club were all well given and were
received with applause.
The Mandolin Club showed t<>
the best advantage in "Harwood

Gavotte," inasmuch as more atten
tion was given by the c 1111 > to the
line points of the piece. "La Czar
ina'" was well interpreted.
The University needs no intro
duction to the work of -Messrs.
Baker and Abbott. Both sang in
their customarily excellent manner,
and were compelled to respond to
well-merited encores. "The Vaga
bond" by Baker was given with
much feeling.
The "Nocturne" by Wells, though
marred by the nervousness of the
player, was received with hearty
applause. A march by the same
composer was given as an encore.
The selections by Dillon were all
received with great enthusiasm, es
pecially "An Irishman's Way of
Telling How. Columbus Discovered
America." Dillon lias never been
heard here to better advantage.
Messrs. Field and Baker, at an
unmistakable request of the audi
ence, gave a humorous duet depict
ing the troubles of the "cold, cold
world." It was well given and
caused considerable merriment.
