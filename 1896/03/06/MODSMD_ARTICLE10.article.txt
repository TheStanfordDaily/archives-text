Editor Daily Palo Alto: Since
the trophy cup has been pur
chased, it is hoped that more inter
est will he taken by the women of
the University in this sport, which
is the most fascinating and most
healthy of all the sports shared in
by the Athletic Association.
There is a mistaken idea about
the cup as to its ownership. Itcan
be played for and won by a player
any number of times in succession,
but it does not remain in her per
manent possession. Each cham
pion's name is engraved on the cup,
and when it is covered with names
it will be turned over to the mil
seum as a curiosity. However,
the cup is possessed pro t<m bv the
champion bet ween the tournaments.
The second annual tournament
for the championship will take
place in May. At present there is
no continuous tournament, as there
was last, semester. The manage
ment of the tennis interests is
vested in a committee of three ap
pointed annually by the president
of the Athletic Association.
The fact that Berkeley has no or
ganized tennis association prevents
a match taking place between the
two universities which would vie
in interest with the coming basket
ball struggle. Such a match will
doubtless be secured before many
years. Rohle Coukt Playeh.
