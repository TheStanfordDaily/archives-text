If there is any one annoyance a
lit le more aggravating than any
other, it is that which many
professors are putting up with
in the shape of late arrivals at
their lectures. It is not only an
aggravation to the lecturer, but to
the auditors as well, and a marked
discourtesy to both. Nothing but
leniency and forbearance of pro
fessors could possibly save the of
fenders from well merited rebuke.
This is especially the case with
popular lecture courses, when the
classes are large and the room
noisy at best.
In most instances there is no ex
cuse for such tardiness. Hut occa
sionally a professor holds his class
after the time is up and in such
case it is not the students but the
professor who is to be blamed. If
each of the faculty members would
be punctual in bis dismissal of the
class on the tap of the bell, there
would undoubtedly be less cause
for general complaint.
