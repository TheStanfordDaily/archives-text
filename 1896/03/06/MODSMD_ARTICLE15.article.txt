Much lias been said and written
concerning cliques in student elec
tions. Kastern colleges have bat
tled with the difliculty, and in none
of them has it been entirely over
thrown. With us there has never
been more than a slight tendency
in that direction. While there is
much in our political methods that
is not commendable, yet no one
can say that the will of the major
it}'has not been properly respected.
The very purpose of a clique is
enough in itself to condemn its ex
istence. it is formed with no other
end in view than to put into an of
fice one whose ability and fitness

for the place would not entitle him
to it. Nothing could he move re
| prehensihle than this, unless it were
ian attempt to purchase the office
l outright. It will not do to argue
j that such methods are employed in
| outside politics; if they are, so much
I the worse. But here within our
j own student organization we can
i take a definite stand against hoss
ism in any form, and guarantee in
| stead a full and free expression of
individual opinion.
