# "Everybody Satisfied."

Yesterday's BerkAcyan has this
|to say of our victory. It must be
very pleasing to our friends across
the bay to know that in the future
they will have to strive just as
hard to keep up with us as they
[ have had to do in the past:
"In tendering our congratulations
to the students at Stanford on the
favorable decision of the United
States Supreme Court in the great
suit against the Stanford estate, we
| feel that we represent t lie whole stu
dent body. With the uncertainty
| and suspense removed, which has
! been chilling and cramping the life
; of the great university down the bay,
! we may expect her to take root once
more and grow up like a spring
plant. Wo students at California
! also congratulate ourselves on the
I return of prosperity to Stanford. It
means that we shall have almost at
our very gates a sturdy rival to
stimulate us and keep us in the way
of progress."
