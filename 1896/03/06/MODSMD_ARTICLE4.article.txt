# The
						Coming Lecture.
## 
### 
The lecture by Prof. Fairclough
on Greek lyric poetry and music,
which was postponed on account of
the bad weather, will be given next
Tuesday evening in the chapel at
7:80. Mrs. A. W. Smith will sing
part of Pindar's First Pythian Ode
and the Hymn to Apollo, with or
chestral accompaniment. This
hymn, both words and music, was
discovered at Delphi by the French
Archaeological School of Athens,
and is the most complete as well
as the most interesting of the sur
viving specimens of ancient Greek
music. It is over 2000 years old
and yet possesses great beauty.
