# Friday Evening- Lecture.
## 
### 
llarr Wagner's remarks in his
lecture last Friday evening were in
substance as follows:
I have never been a great success
nor a great failure, and the only
excuse 1 have for coming to you
ibis evening is the excuse made by
Dr. Jordan when he said, "It will
be well for you to practice upon
t he students."
In my travels in America I have
heard lectures on liberty and seen
pictures on liberty. One day in
San Diego 1 heard the president of
this institution show something of
the hereditary environment of
people, and to me it wast he strong
est lecture on liberty 1 ever heard.
From that time on I began to no
tice, and 1 bring to you some of the
things I have noticed, not alto
gether in history but along the line
of human lives. The story of lib
erty is one of human interest; it is
the divine autobiography of Provi
dence; it had its birth on Mt. Sinai,
its cradle in Bethlehem, its sickly,
crying childhood in Home, its edu
cation in England with France and
Spain as its scion school-masters, its
voung manhood in America, and
its future life —the universal world.
If there were to be made a com
posite picture of all the flags of the
world, that composite flag would
not be over a nation that is free,
unless that composite Hag of na
tions was the Star of Bethlehem.
(lalileo said, ' The world moves."
Then we come to England to the
green meadows of llunnyinede.
.June 1") —over the meadow the
army of God and opposite the
Castle of Windsor where lived .John
Lackland. The army demanded
certain liberties, and these liberties
were given to the barons of Eng
land under the name of Magna
Charta, and that was the begin
ning of constitutional liberty.
Then came Watt Tyler, the great
promoter of liberty and freedom;
and Caxton, who first used the
metal type in printing. Germany
gave us Luther. He was a student,
a professor, and later a monk, and
in his missions in the church he
started a wave of liberty that has
touched upon every shore. On
England's throne at this time was
Henry VIII, whose record of infi
delity is almost unparalleled in the
world's history.
When we come to Spain we
would that her history had not
been written were it not for the fact
that Columbus sailed from her
shores and discovered America, the
new home of liberty. And in Amer
ica do we not feel the poet's dream,
that from the Atlantic to the Pa
cific there is the universal bond?
I saw three pictures during the
past week that have never been
painted. Pictures of today. On
the streets of San Francisco an old
gray haired woman, so pitifully
old, selling papers for money with
which to buy a bit of bread. A
little farther down the street at the
Palace Hotel door, a little boy
hardly five years old, selling pa
pers fora bit of bread to eat; and
I said that in this country liberty
was a failure as long as that old
woman and that young boy sold
papers to keep them from starva
tion, while millionaire passed by
who had accumulated their wealth

right here. I went into a little
shoe shop, anil while there u man
came in and left his own shoes
taking a poorer pair in exchange,
with two hits to hoot, with which
to huy a meal. When a country
produces as this country does, there
is no excuse for conditions of this
kind —something is wrong. The
time never will come until the Ser
mon on the Mount is put into prac
tice in the daily lives of people.
Our senate and legislatures seem
margined ahout with capital, and
laws are hardly ever passed bene
fiting the poor and laboring peo
ple. 1 sometimes wonder what it
will all lead to —yet I am not an
alarmist. J think there is a divine
will running through the affairs of
men. And to love liberty and not
love this country! —one might as
well 1 ove poetry and not love the
works of Shakspere, Lowell, and
Longfellow —love art and despise
the works of Raphael and Angelo —
love music ami not love Beethoven
and Mozart.
1 would rather believe with the
Californian senator who said,
"America baptized anew will live
yet a thousand years to come."
The Colossus Liberty —her feet up
on the continents, her scepter over
the sea. and her forehead among
the stars.
After the lecture a variety of
stereoptieon views were given.
