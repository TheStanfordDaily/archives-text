At last the baseball management
has followed the example set by
K a stern colleges and organized a
second nine for regular practice
with the Varsity. Such a move
has long heen expected and will
undoubtedly result in great bene
fit to the baseball interests. Ad
mittance to the second nine will he
just as closely watched and in pro
portion just as difficult to obtain as
is that to the Varsity. Its mem
bers will he controlled by a captain
appointed by the captain of the
first team and will be everywhere
subject to his orders. Trips are to
be taken and games played with
outside teams, and the nine treated
in all respects as is the second
eleven during football season. As
soon as a member of the second
team shows himself qualified fora
position on the first, he will be
duly promoted and a member of
the first team correspondingly
lowered. In short, by such a
scheme the interest and expecta
tions of the players will not lag.
No man will be sure of his position
and the life blood of the team will
he kept in active, healthy circula
tion. If the players will turn
out and receive the aid and in
formation which the coach has to

impart to thetii in the short time
that remains to him, our prospects
j for victory over Berkeley this year
! will suffer no diminution from that
i of previous years.
