### 
The annual meeting of the Inter
collegiate Association of Amateur
Athletes of America was held in
New Vork, Feb. 29.
A motion to form an alliance
with the Amateur Athletic Union
was passed and in the future the
1. A. A. A. A. is entitled to repre
sentation at all meetings of the
A. A. I'. by four delegates, having
collectively one vote.
A motion to add the three-mile
run to the list of events for the an
nual championship games was lost.
An important change was effected,
however, on the program. Instead
of a two-mile bicycle race, live
cycling events were added. They
will take place on Wednesday pre
vious to the Saturday of the ath
letic championship, and a separate
challenge cup will be presented to
the winning college.
The entire program now is: 100-
yard dash, 220-yard dash, quarter
mile, half mile, mile, high hurdles,
low hurdles, one-mile walk, running
high jump, running broad jump,
pole-vault, putting the shot (IB
pounds), throwing the hammer (IB
pounds); in the bicycle meeting:
quarter mile, half mile, one mile,
five miles, and one mile for tan
