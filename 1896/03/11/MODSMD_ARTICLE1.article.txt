# FOUNDERS' DAY EXERCISES.
## Senator Stanford's Birthday Fittingly Observed. 
### 
Monday, the birthday of Leland
Stanford, was appropriately ob
served by exercises in the evening
in the chapel. The lecturn and
railing were tastefully decorated,
and the room was comfortably
tilled by half-past seven.
The program was opened with
Prof. Smith's Founders' Day
Hymn, "'Wind of Freedom," sung
by the (ilee Club. Then prayer
was offered by Prof. A. B. Show,
followed by a solo by Mrs. Ida. A.
Morey of Belmont. Her selection,
''(■Jo Thou in Peace," was delicately
rendered.
The speaker of the evening, Mr.
John S. Ilittell, was introduced by
President Jordan, who said that
the memory of the founder of the
University, his life, his purposes,
and his devotion to the interests of
the people, are very fresh and will
ever remain green with all of us.
And they will always be very near
to the hearts of those who love edu
cation and those who love learning.
It is fitting that one day in the
year we should give consideration
to the works of his life. "Tonight
we have The history of California
and Leland Stanford's place in it,'
by Mr. John S. 11 it tell of San Fran
cisco."
Mr. Ilittell spoke in part as fol
lows:
On this occasion when we have
met to recall and to cherish the as
sociations connected with this insti
tution of learning, no subject could
be found more appropriate for
your consideration than the history
of the place in which you live and
an account of what Leland Stan
ford did in it during more than a
quarter of a century of his life.
A century and a half ago the
only inhabitants of this state were
red men. We know comparatively
little of them and of their work.
They left a large following of de
scendants, but the only trace of
their existence is in their stone im
plements and mortars.
In 1769 Spain undertook to
christianize the natives. Twenty
two missions were founded and the
Indians were reduced to bondage.
They were treated as children and
called wards.
Partly through disease and partly
through change in manner of liv
ing the red men decreased rapidly.
The mental constitution of the
savage could not adapt itself easily
to the change. All the examples
have failed to produce one good
farmer or one good mechanic of red
blood in California.
They were never thoroughly
christianized; they showed no zeal
for the faith, nor comprehension of
the doctrine.
The Franciscans should not be
blamed for their failure to christ
ianize the Indians. The friars
were not learned outside the ec
clesiastical studies.
Pecuniarily the results were a
failure. They raised nothing but
cattle, and dealt only in hides and
tallow.
Still, though in many respects
failures, in others the missions ren
dered valuable service to California.
In 1822, after an existence of
fifty-three years, the missions ended

when tlie of Spain was hauled
down and the territory passed un
der Mexican rule. As Spaniards,
the friars hated the Republic. As
they saw that the authorities would
not protect their system they left.
The important result of the es
tablishment of Mexican rule in
California was the subjugation of
the missions. The land was divided
up among individual owners and
the Indians left free to return to
their savage life. The government
offered to every'citizen land enough
for his cattle; a man who had a
dozen cows might get a Spanish
league, containing about three
square miles. The only noticeable
improvements 011 the ranches were
a house and a corral. The walls
of the buildings were made of adobe.
The people were a healthy race;
many of the men and women were
remarkably handsome. Their diet
and dress was simple. All the
herds of the ranch were wild ex
cept the riding horses. The people
married early, and the women gave
their chief attention to children
and family cares.
After a duration of twenty-live
years this life ended in 1848 when
gold was found in the Sierra Ne
vada range. This country became
the placer miner's paradise. Men
rushed in on all sides to share the
spoils. Provisions could be ob
tained only from a distance; these
commanded an enormously high
price.
Gradually business became more
stable. Most of the mining came
from hydraulic mining, which re
quired more skill. The laws of the
United States concerning land ti
tles involved much litigation; and
the lawyers did much to complete
the work which the squatters had
done.
The savages died from contact
with white men; the friars fled from
the Mexicans.
Such are some of the changes
in this region within a century
and a half. Mining ceased
to be the chief product of our in
come when a trans-continental rail
road became an assured thing.
This was the result of the enter
prise of live Sacramento merchants
who comb.ned to build a railroad
across the continent. Their work
was a great success. They not
only built the Central Pacific, but
they devoted their lives to the
work of building railroads. They
all died in the harness.
Let us recall the condition of the
State before 18(>(>. Travelers spent
three weeks in coming from New
York. The farmers could not bring
their implements across the conti
nent.
The only hope for the new era of
prosperity was the construction of
a railroad system opening up our
valleys and connecting them with
the Atlantic. To fulfill this hope
Mr. Stanford with his associates
devoted much of his lifetime. They
induced Congress to grant them sub
sidies.
Of these live railroad builders, the
one whose name was most widely
known, who was believed by the
State to have the strongest organi
zation of mental and physical qual
ities, was he la ml Stanford. He
made acquaintances easily; he was
just, generous, and brave. Slow to

feel and gentle in anger, he was
liberal to all. lie did not know
what it was to tighten the strings'
of his purse or his heart.
He had a remarkable faculty of
organization. During his life he j
was interested in four great enter
prises: The railroad to California;
the street-car system in San Fran
cisco; the horse farm at Palo Alto; |
and this University. lie possessed
those faculties that command sue-,
cess in life. The railway opportu-1
nity had scarcely made its appear-!
a nee when he seized it and pushed!
it to its final conclusion. He has I
left this institution as a magnifi- J
cent benefaction to those in whom he ;
was always interested. Governor
of California, Senator of the United
States, and for thirty years he
was president of the railway com
pany, during which time he spent>
much money in developing 1 he sys
tem. Of all California's men Stan
ford was the one who held the most
high offices, who contributed most
to the wealth of the State, who, to
use the phrase of an engineer,
wrote his name from end to end on
the map in letters of iron; and his
name is most identified with its
history. Nothing said against him
prevented the public from believing
that he was a good man.
The last work of his life was the
establishment of this University in
the State in which he had lived',so
well. Death overtook him at last.
And in the midst of the business
depression that prevailed ovjrth e
United States a suit was brought
by a federal officer to overthrow
the results of this bequest.
It was a suit by the. United
States against the people of the
State of California, who own this
institution as much as the one at
Berkeley. The burden of the ef
fort was laid upon Mrs. Stanford,
who has proved herself equal to
the task. She developed a remark
able courage and an administrative
capacity that attracted the admi
ration of those who have watched i
her in the last three years.
Two names will ever stand side
by side as the founders of the Le
land Stanford Junior University.
Husband and wife together, one
heart, united in purpose, they set
about this grand work. Their
memories should hold a high place
in the hearts of the people of the
State of California, because in its
history their names will ever be
prominent.
The program was concluded by
a solo, "Santa Maria," by Mrs.
Morey. This selection was received
with applause.

Stanford, was appropriately ob

nity had scarcely made its appear-!
a nee when he seized it and pushed!
it to its final conclusion. He has I
left this institution as a magnifi- J
cent benefaction to those in whom he ;
was always interested. Governor
of California, Senator of the United
States, and for thirty years he
was president of the railway com
pany, during which time he spent>
much money in developing 1 he sys
tem. Of all California's men Stan
ford was the one who held the most
high offices, who contributed most
to the wealth of the State, who, to
use the phrase of an engineer,
wrote his name from end to end on
the map in letters of iron; and his
name is most identified with its
history. Nothing said against him
prevented the public from believing
that he was a good man.
The last work of his life was the
establishment of this University in
the State in which he had lived',so
well. Death overtook him at last.
And in the midst of the business
depression that prevailed ovjrth e
United States a suit was brought
by a federal officer to overthrow
the results of this bequest.
It was a suit by the. United
States against the people of the
State of California, who own this
institution as much as the one at
Berkeley. The burden of the ef
fort was laid upon Mrs. Stanford,
who has proved herself equal to
the task. She developed a remark
able courage and an administrative
capacity that attracted the admi
ration of those who have watched i
her in the last three years.
Two names will ever stand side
by side as the founders of the Le
land Stanford Junior University.
Husband and wife together, one
heart, united in purpose, they set
about this grand work. Their
memories should hold a high place
in the hearts of the people of the
State of California, because in its
history their names will ever be
prominent.
The program was concluded by
a solo, "Santa Maria," by Mrs.
Morey. This selection was received
with applause.
Monday, the birthday of Leland
Stanford, was appropriately ob
served by exercises in the evening
in the chapel. The lecturn and
railing were tastefully decorated,
and the room was comfortably
tilled by half-past seven.
The program was opened with
Prof. Smith's Founders' Day
Hymn, "'Wind of Freedom," sung
by the (ilee Club. Then prayer
was offered by Prof. A. B. Show,
followed by a solo by Mrs. Ida. A.
Morey of Belmont. Her selection,
''(■Jo Thou in Peace," was delicately
rendered.
The speaker of the evening, Mr.
John S. Ilittell, was introduced by
President Jordan, who said that
the memory of the founder of the
University, his life, his purposes,
and his devotion to the interests of
the people, are very fresh and will
ever remain green with all of us.
And they will always be very near
to the hearts of those who love edu
cation and those who love learning.
It is fitting that one day in the
year we should give consideration
to the works of his life. "Tonight
we have The history of California
and Leland Stanford's place in it,'
by Mr. John S. 11 it tell of San Fran
cisco."
Mr. Ilittell spoke in part as fol
lows:
On this occasion when we have
met to recall and to cherish the as
sociations connected with this insti
tution of learning, no subject could
be found more appropriate for
your consideration than the history
of the place in which you live and
an account of what Leland Stan
ford did in it during more than a
quarter of a century of his life.
A century and a half ago the
only inhabitants of this state were
red men. We know comparatively
little of them and of their work.
They left a large following of de
scendants, but the only trace of
their existence is in their stone im
plements and mortars.
In 1769 Spain undertook to
christianize the natives. Twenty
two missions were founded and the
Indians were reduced to bondage.
They were treated as children and
called wards.
Partly through disease and partly
through change in manner of liv
ing the red men decreased rapidly.
The mental constitution of the
savage could not adapt itself easily
to the change. All the examples
have failed to produce one good
farmer or one good mechanic of red
blood in California.
They were never thoroughly
christianized; they showed no zeal
for the faith, nor comprehension of
the doctrine.
The Franciscans should not be
blamed for their failure to christ
ianize the Indians. The friars
were not learned outside the ec
clesiastical studies.
Pecuniarily the results were a
failure. They raised nothing but
cattle, and dealt only in hides and
tallow.
Still, though in many respects
failures, in others the missions ren
dered valuable service to California.
In 1822, after an existence of
fifty-three years, the missions ended

when tlie of Spain was hauled
down and the territory passed un
der Mexican rule. As Spaniards,
the friars hated the Republic. As
they saw that the authorities would
not protect their system they left.
The important result of the es
tablishment of Mexican rule in
California was the subjugation of
the missions. The land was divided
up among individual owners and
the Indians left free to return to
their savage life. The government
offered to every'citizen land enough
for his cattle; a man who had a
dozen cows might get a Spanish
league, containing about three
square miles. The only noticeable
improvements 011 the ranches were
a house and a corral. The walls
of the buildings were made of adobe.
The people were a healthy race;
many of the men and women were
remarkably handsome. Their diet
and dress was simple. All the
herds of the ranch were wild ex
cept the riding horses. The people
married early, and the women gave
their chief attention to children
and family cares.
After a duration of twenty-live
years this life ended in 1848 when
gold was found in the Sierra Ne
vada range. This country became
the placer miner's paradise. Men
rushed in on all sides to share the
spoils. Provisions could be ob
tained only from a distance; these
commanded an enormously high
price.
Gradually business became more
stable. Most of the mining came
from hydraulic mining, which re
quired more skill. The laws of the
United States concerning land ti
tles involved much litigation; and
the lawyers did much to complete
the work which the squatters had
done.
The savages died from contact
with white men; the friars fled from
the Mexicans.
Such are some of the changes
in this region within a century
and a half. Mining ceased
to be the chief product of our in
come when a trans-continental rail
road became an assured thing.
This was the result of the enter
prise of live Sacramento merchants
who comb.ned to build a railroad
across the continent. Their work
was a great success. They not
only built the Central Pacific, but
they devoted their lives to the
work of building railroads. They
all died in the harness.
Let us recall the condition of the
State before 18(>(>. Travelers spent
three weeks in coming from New
York. The farmers could not bring
their implements across the conti
nent.
The only hope for the new era of
prosperity was the construction of
a railroad system opening up our
valleys and connecting them with
the Atlantic. To fulfill this hope
Mr. Stanford with his associates
devoted much of his lifetime. They
induced Congress to grant them sub
sidies.
Of these live railroad builders, the
one whose name was most widely
known, who was believed by the
State to have the strongest organi
zation of mental and physical qual
ities, was he la ml Stanford. He
made acquaintances easily; he was
just, generous, and brave. Slow to

feel and gentle in anger, he was
liberal to all. lie did not know
what it was to tighten the strings'
of his purse or his heart.
He had a remarkable faculty of
organization. During his life he j
was interested in four great enter
prises: The railroad to California;
the street-car system in San Fran
cisco; the horse farm at Palo Alto; |
and this University. lie possessed
those faculties that command sue-,
cess in life. The railway opportu-1
nity had scarcely made its appear-!
a nee when he seized it and pushed!
it to its final conclusion. He has I
left this institution as a magnifi- J
cent benefaction to those in whom he ;
was always interested. Governor
of California, Senator of the United
States, and for thirty years he
was president of the railway com

prevented the public from believing

The last work of his life was the
