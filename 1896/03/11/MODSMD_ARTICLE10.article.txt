The student body and the man
agement of the athletic team are
exerting all possible efforts this
year to wrest from Berkeley their
ancient supremacy on the track.
The students have provided most
generously the sinew of war, and
the captain and manager have been
untiring in their efforts. More
over, a strong athletic spirit has
been worked up here. The track
squad this year numbers almost
double that of last year. Good men
who have formerly held back arc
coming out as candidates for the
teams, and are training hard and
faithfully.
Nevertheless, the effect of all
this enthusiasm has been largely
neutralized by the action of a few
of the very best men we most rely
on our best and most experienced
athletes. To put it plainly,certain
men are openly and continually
breaking training rules. What

c;in v.i txpect from the newer ath
, lcu-s, if the older men who have
, trained long enough to know better
appear upon the oval smoking, or
are seen up and about long after
the hour when any athlete is ex
pected to be in bed?
We need these same men. and we
need them badly; but it would be
better to drop them entirely from
the athletic team than to permit
them to demoralize that athletic
discipline without which we can
not hope for victory.
