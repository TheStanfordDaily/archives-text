Kjmtok Daily Palo Alto:
Some members of the Junior
Class show an utter indifference to
the success of the Annual. Inside
of two weeks the hook goes to press,
and it is from now on that the
heaviest expenses must he met.
[lie class assessment was relied
upon for this, hut up to date so
many have not paid the two dol
lars that work ;it present is seri
ously handicapped. There are
some in the class, no douht, who
can not afford this amount; there
are also a very few others who will
not pay because they can not he
forced to it; with such people
nothing can he done. lint the ma
jority of the delinquent}* (ran and
are willing to pay some time, hut
insist on putting it off. These
should understand that it is right
now that money is needed the
worst, when there is no other source
â€¢ it' revenue. The treasurer has col
lected only half as much as was re
ceived from the : i><> Class. This is
not because a thorough canvass
has not been made of the class, jis
nearly every member has been seen
over and over again; but because
the majority feel too little interest
in the matter to pay the assess
ment. It is to he hoped that a
great many will pay up within this
week. Q. K. I).
