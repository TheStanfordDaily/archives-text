# Basket-Ball.
## 
### 
It appears at last that we are to
have an intercollegiate game of
basket-ball. The Stanford man
agement has consented to Berkeley's
request that the game he played in
doors, and today Miss Kiefer sent
the following answer to Berkeley's
acceptance:
Miss Edith .J. Bkownbell, Man
ager of Basket-ball Team, Uni
versity of California: In reply to
your acceptance of our challenge
dated March 4, 1 would say that
we are entirely willing to play in
doors, and prefer to play before la
dies only. On account of the
liability to accident we prefer a
dirt or tan-bark floor to a wooden
one.
We are compelled to ask you to
reconsider the date of the game,
since our spring vacation occurs
between March 21 and March 80,
and several of the members of the
team have arranged to go home at
that time. We would tind it most
convenient to have the date set not
earlier than April 8.
We shall be glad to send a rep
resentative to confer with you in re
gard to the details of the game, on
any date you may mention.
Very respectfully yours,
Miss Kihkkk, Manager.
