Tn K generosity displayed by
many of San Jose's leading society
ladies and prominent business men
in their recent dealings with the
(ilee and Mandolin Clubs strikes a j
chord of gratitude in the heart of
every Stanford student. San Jose
has always been an ardent friend
and supporter of this institution,
and the recent kindly action of her
citizens but emphasizes her friend
liness toward us. The concert
which the two musical organiza
tions are to give next Saturday
evening is the first that they have!
given in that city for two years.
At the time of the last concert the
clubs barely made expenses, and
their intentions being misunder
stood, came away somewhat under
a cloud. For this reason it is;
hoped that the coming entertain
ment will be a great success, and
that the people of San Jose, as well
as the representatives of this Uni
versity, will be fully vindicated for
the confidence they have placed in !
each other. Now is an opportune
time for those students who live in i
San Jose to prove their loyalty to
the I niversitv by promoting the in-j
terests of an entertainment given!
for the benefit of two of the Uni
versity's most prominent organi
zations.
