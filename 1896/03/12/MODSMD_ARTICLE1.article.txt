# GLORIOUS LIFE.
## Sermon by Rev. R. F. Maclaren of San Jose. 
### 
Text, Epistle to the Unmans,
viii, S: ''For I reckon that the suf
ferings of this present time are not
worthy to be compared with the
glory which shall be revealed to
us.''
The one decisive thing in this
text is glory. We shall find that
the work and labor involved in
loving and serving our Lord and
Master all tends to glory. The his
tory of all the world's great men
has shown this to be true.
In the old Jewish times there
were many promises made and
many great things held out as a re
reward for doing right. I'he Lord
protected the Israelites from their
enemies; He led them through the
I ted Sea and brought them into the
promised land. Everything was
promised them if they would but
obey Him. The Christian Era
dawns and our Lord sends out His
disciples. Then was the time of
great unrest. But the disciples
were not promised great things; in
fact, they were promised nothing
but suffering. Their lives were a
most magnificent sacrifice.
The disciples might have escaped
from these sufferings. If I had
lived in the time of Paul, and if I
had not had the courage of Paul, I
should not have gone to Rome.
There only the sword awaited him.
I should have gone to Alexandria,
with its great and magnificent li
braries, or to Antioch, or to some
other of the numerous cities where
I might have lived in peace. But
if Paul had done this, we should
not be speaking his name this
morning.
If we put on the character of a
voluptuary we shall get along all
right. But if we are Christians
and there is a single sufferer, we
can not rest or take comfort until
that person has been attended to.
The preacher is called upon to
strike, oftentimes very hard, against
the evils of his day. It is often
easier to withhold. Isaiah by a
very little deflection could have
compromised with Jezebel, and
would not have had to go out into
the world, a castaway. And so
with John the Baptist. King Herod
bad a kindly feeling towards him,
and if John had only compromised
a little, he need not to have been
led to a dungeon, nor there to have
met his death. The same will
power and courage, the same devo
tion to principle, is required to
preach the truth in this day. Dr.
Parkhurst could have preached
about the evils of Babylon all his
life, and he would always have had
a large audience. But had he (lone
so there would have been no such
victories of right over wrong as we
have all had the pleasure of wit
nessing. Paul voices a great truth
when he says,"I reckon that the
sufferings of this present time are
not worthy to be compared to the
glory which shall be revealed to
us.''
The lives of these kinds of men
are always connected with suffer
ing. But the suffering, in turn, is
always connected with glory.
Those who are pleased to visit
the Old World will find that no
monument has been raised to a

voluptuary. Those who have mon
uments are those who have been
willing to suffer—who have suf
; fered. Of those who visit the great
Venetian cathedra! dedicated to St.
I Mark, how many know how it
| came to he named after Mark?
I Mow many think of Mark, and
1 how he and Barnahas holdly sailed
out into the Mediterranean to
preach the gospel, chancing once
to land on the muddy shore of one
of the islands on which Venice now
rests; how, when the Gauls swooped
I down upon Koine, hearing it asun
der, a little hand tied to the shores
'of the Adriatic, that they might
j preserve their civilization and their
religion; how piles were driven
; into these muddy isles, and the city
lof Venice grew upon them; and
! how, centuries after, when their
| great cathedral was built, it was
called St. Mark, because th;it
j apostle had once kneeled upon the
I muddy shores of one of their
islands. Such examples as this
j are very largely historical, and be-
I yond the reach of the vast multi
tude. But in every one we can see
the glory which comes to those who
serve Truth with unswerving fi
; delity.
We all aspire after glory. Hut
let me give this warning: those
who would win glory must be pre
pared to suffer. I have indicated
that very much of this glory will
appear here upon this earth; but
the greater part is to come hereaf
ter. That wonderful and glorious
empire that lies beyond contains
glories with which the glories of
| this world are not to be compared.
Struggle onward! remembering
' that to the victor is the crown, and
j to him that hath borne its burdens
faithfully are monuments and
I glory in this world, and joy ever
lasting in the world to come.
