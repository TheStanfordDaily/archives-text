The Merchants' Association of
Palo Alto is about to use its in
fiuenee to induce the Southern
Pacific Company to have the fiver
both down and up stop ;it the sta
tion there. The association will
ask the authorities and the students
of the University to aid them in
this - project. If the railway com
pany could he persuaded to grant
the request, it would be a great con
venience both to the townspeople
and the students of Stanford. The
passenger traffic between Palo Alto
and the city is said to be greater
than from any other station as far
south as San Jose. Not only so,
but that traffic is likely to become
much heavier in the near future.
As the student body of Stanford
grows more numerous and as the
population of the University town
expands, the train service with the
city will have to be improved.
There is no reason whv the im
provement should not commence at
once. We sincerely hope, therefore,
that the merchants of Palo Alto
will meet with success in this move,
and that anv assistance the Uni
versity can lend them will befreely
rendered.
