# Varsity Victory.
## 
### 
A team composed mainly of ex-
Stanford players, under the cap
taincy of ''Jack" Sheehan, played
a practice game with the Varsity
Tuesday. The visitors were evi
dently out of practice and the
pitchers soon became tired, so that
the Varsity had a more easy vic
tory than was warranted by the
real playing strength of the nines.
The Varsity played a good game
for this period of the season. The
handling of ground-balls by the in
field was especially good, all the
errors being muffs of thrown balls.
The score:
STANFORD.
