# The 						Sophomore Cotillion.
## 
### 
Encina gymnasium never wit
nessed a prettier or more enjoyable
social affair than t lie cotillion
given Friday evening bv the Class
of ' ( JK. The big bare structure, so
hard to give a presentable appear
ance, was for once successfully dec
orated. White and purple, the
class colors, were displayed every
where. Long festoons of these fa
vored colors hung from the apex of
the hall to its corners, or twined
around the pillars and railings.
The roof and corners were trimmed
with living green. The east cor
ner, reserved for the patronesses,
was cosily canopied and softly
lighted by piano lamps. All to
gether the decorations were beauti
ful and tasteful, and reflect great
credit on the committee in charge.
Engraved programs were pre
sented to the dancers, the front of
the cover being ornamented with
the words "Sophomore Cotillion"
in purple letters, encircled with a.
delicate scroll, and the back with
the Stanford yell, also in purple let
ters. The program proper con
sisted of twelve dances and four
extras besides the cotillion. The
music was furnished by Schmidt's
Columbia Orchestra of six pieces
and was the best that has been
heard here in some time. Its ex
cellence was a cause for general
comment.
At about eleven o'clock the fea
ture of the evening, the cotillion,
began. There were but four figures
in all and their evolution occupied
about two hours. Stewart \V. Cot
ton as president of the class had
the honor of leading the cotillion.
He was assisted on the floor by
(i. H. Francis and W. C. McNeil.
The tigures were gone through with
very prettily and smoothly, and
showed well the careful preparation
of the leader and the lirstset. Out
of two of their intricate windings
and revolutions were produced the
figures 98, and the outline of the
quadrangle with its four arches,
through which four young ladies
led their followers, and executed as
many "separations" inside the
square. The latter figure was a
lantern and llag figure, the lights
in the hall were turned out and the
effect of the many moving and
winding lights was bewitching and
dazzling in the extreme. After the
conclusion of the cotillion figures
the regular dances were continued,
and with the addition of several
extras the program was brought to
an end at about two o'clock.
About sixty couples participated,
many coming from San Francisco
and San Jose to attend.
