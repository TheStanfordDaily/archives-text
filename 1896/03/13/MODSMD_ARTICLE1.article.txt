# "GREEK LYRIC POETRY AND MUSIC."
## The 						Lecture Tuesday Evening- by Prof. Fairclough. 
### 
An unusually large audience
gathered in the chapel last Tues
day evening to hear the lecture by
Prof. Fairclough upon "(ireek lyric
poetry and music." The subject
proved of exceptional interest both
from the exhaustive treatment of
the subject and from the musical
illustrations, which accompanied
the lecture. One of the latter —
notably the "Hymn to Apollo"
was given in all probabil
ity for the first time in any col
lege in this country. A brief sum
mary of the lecture is given below:
11 is hardly necessary to insist
upon the intrinsic and permanent
value of Greek poetry. Asa body of
literature (ireek poetry is the most
valuable legacy that we moderns
have received from ancient times.
Nevertheless, the great bulk of
Greek lyric poetry has disappeared.
The reason is to he found in the es
sential character of that poetry. It
was song poetry and composed for
singing, the soul of which vanished
when the music passed away.
After the loss of Greek independence
(ireek music rapidly degenerated.
Scanty, however, as are the frag
ments of Greek lyric poetry, these
fragments are of priceless value.
Their intrinsic worth and beauty
are often most conspicuous, and as
a rule they bear out the eulogies
pronounced upon their authors by
the ancients.
The epic held undisputed sway
in Greece down to the end of the
eighth century before our era. Then
began a movement in the direction
of political freedom. It was coin
cident with this change that lyric
poetry, the poetry that voiced, not
the ancestral glory of kings and
princes, but the feelings and experi
ence of the individual, came into
being. In lonic Greece the new
poetry took two forms, the elegiac
and the iambic, but that which
alone was regarded by the Greeks
as lyric was the poetry of tin; Aeo
lian and Dorian tribes The Aeolic
was intended to be sung by a single
voice, while the Doric lyric poetry
was sung by a number in chorus,
accompanied by dancing and mu
sical instruments.
The history of lyric poetry in
Greece is intimately connected with
the history of music, and the his
tory of Greek music, if we set aside
the fables of Aniphion, Olympus,
and Orpheus, begins practically
with Terpander, who, like Alcaeus
and Sappho, was born in the Aeo
lian isle of Lesbos.
Before Terparider's day the only
accompaniment used by the early
Greeks was a four-stringed lyre, an
instrument so generally used that
the whole system of (ireek music is
based upon it. Terpander added
three strings to it, and Pythagoras
is credited with adding the eighth
st ring.
The music of part of Pindar's
first Pythian ode, which was found
in MS. in a monastery near Mes
sina, about the year I (550, was writ
ten at a time when both the hepta
chord and octachord were known,
but we may infer from this music,
which contains only two intervals
of more than four tones, that even

i at the time of its composition nielo
j dies were often confined to the old
' tetracliord.
Besides tlie simple diatonic sys
tem, (J reek musicians devised two
others, the chromatic and the en
j harmonic. In the former the in
! terval is a tone and a half and two
j semitones (E, C sharp, C, B). In
tlie enharmonic the tetracliord has
an interval of two full tones and
two minor ones of quarter tones (E,
0, B sharp, B).
In early times there wjere only
I three scales known, the Dorian, the
; Phrygian, and the Lydian. After
' wards were added the Hypolydian,
Hyi jophrygian, Hypodorian, and
Mixolydian. The'Se modes or scales,
which figure so much in Greek litera
ture, differ first of all according to
the position of the semi-tones in the
sen le, and in the second place in act
ual practice they differ in the pitch
of the whole, the Doric being the
lowest, the Phrygian the medium,
and the Lydian the highest. The
Dorian, therefore, was appropriate
| for male voices, the Lydian for
' women and children.
[These modes were played on the
piano to represent the points made
l>y the lecturer. Other illustra
tions of Greek musical character
istics were made at this point. Pin
dar's beautiful ode was sung by
Mrs. Smith in a charming manner.]
In the best days of (ireek society
the only musical instruments em
ployed were practically the lyre, a
string instrument, and the flute, a
wind instrument. Other string in
struments, such as the citara, phor
minx, psaltery, chelys, barbiton,
and pectis were all mere variations
! of the lyre. Instruments with a
large number of strings were known
as the magadis and trigon. The
trigon was something like our harp,
and had as many as thirteen
strings, while the magadis would
have as many as thirty.
Did the Greeksemploy harmony?
is a question often asked. Yes and
no, we can answer. Part-singing
was unknown among them, as well
as the elaborate harmonies of the
modern art. Yet they did under
stand and employ harmonies,
j though with the exception of octave
i singing these were confined to in-
I strumental music. (Ireek sculpture
| exhibits groups of players on pipes
i of different lengths, which must
: have produced different notes when
played simultaneously. Plato speaks
with disdain of certain accompani-
I ments that were elaborate and
quite independent of the air, and
exhibiting a variety of intervals,
j In the best days of (Ireek song,
however, harmony seems to have
I been little more than a matter of
j octaves, fourths, and fifths.
[An ancient hymn to the muse
was here sung with simple harmo
nics arranged according to (ireek
theorists by Mr. Wells. |
Ancient notation, which was
based on the letters of the alphabet,
i was designed for twenty-one notes
within the octave, each original
note being followed by two supple
mentary ones. Quarter tones were
sung by the voice and played on
strings. [An illustration of (ireek
musical notation was given from
Euripides. ]
European music seems as bar
barous to Orientals as theirs does to

us, and therefore if we recovered
Greek music we should probably re
gard it with more curiosity than
admiration. And yet the recently
discovered hymn to Apollo, has, in
certain musical circles, as in Paris,
where it was sung by a large cho
rus, been received with great enthu
siasm. This hymn is the most
complete specimen that we possess
of ancient Greek music. It was
discovered at Delphi in May, 1893,
engraved on two blocks of marble.
It is written in the Dorian mode, in
the Cretic or Paeonian rhythm, and
in the peculiar time of five fourths.
[Mrs. Smith here sang the hymn,
accompanied by Mrs. Maitland at
the piano and an orchestra consist
ing of Miss Fletcher and Messrs.
Dully and Mr. Wells. The hymn
was beautifully rendered, and in
the opinion of many possesses great
charm and musical merit, though
it is over 2000 years old.]

with Terpander, who, like Alcaeus
and Sappho, was born in the Aeo
lian isle of Lesbos.
Before Terparider's day the only
accompaniment used by the early
Greeks was a four-stringed lyre, an
instrument so generally used that
the whole system of (ireek music is
based upon it. Terpander added
three strings to it, and Pythagoras
is credited with adding the eighth
st ring.
The music of part of Pindar's
first Pythian ode, which was found
in MS. in a monastery near Mes
sina, about the year I (550, was writ
ten at a time when both the hepta
chord and octachord were known,
but we may infer from this music,
which contains only two intervals
of more than four tones, that even

i at the time of its composition nielo
j dies were often confined to the old
' tetracliord.
Besides tlie simple diatonic sys
tem, (J reek musicians devised two
others, the chromatic and the en
j harmonic. In the former the in
! terval is a tone and a half and two
j semitones (E, C sharp, C, B). In
tlie enharmonic the tetracliord has
an interval of two full tones and
two minor ones of quarter tones (E,
0, B sharp, B).
In early times there wjere only
I three scales known, the Dorian, the
; Phrygian, and the Lydian. After
' wards were added the Hypolydian,
Hyi jophrygian, Hypodorian, and
Mixolydian. The'Se modes or scales,
which figure so much in Greek litera
ture, differ first of all according to
the position of the semi-tones in the
sen le, and in the second place in act
ual practice they differ in the pitch
of the whole, the Doric being the
lowest, the Phrygian the medium,
and the Lydian the highest. The
Dorian, therefore, was appropriate
| for male voices, the Lydian for
' women and children.
[These modes were played on the
piano to represent the points made
l>y the lecturer. Other illustra
tions of Greek musical character
istics were made at this point. Pin
dar's beautiful ode was sung by
Mrs. Smith in a charming manner.]
In the best days of (ireek society
the only musical instruments em
ployed were practically the lyre, a
string instrument, and the flute, a
wind instrument. Other string in
struments, such as the citara, phor
minx, psaltery, chelys, barbiton,
and pectis were all mere variations
! of the lyre. Instruments with a
large number of strings were known
as the magadis and trigon. The
trigon was something like our harp,
and had as many as thirteen
strings, while the magadis would
have as many as thirty.
Did the Greeksemploy harmony?
is a question often asked. Yes and
no, we can answer. Part-singing
was unknown among them, as well
as the elaborate harmonies of the
modern art. Yet they did under
stand and employ harmonies,
j though with the exception of octave
i singing these were confined to in-
I strumental music. (Ireek sculpture
| exhibits groups of players on pipes
i of different lengths, which must
: have produced different notes when
played simultaneously. Plato speaks
with disdain of certain accompani-
I ments that were elaborate and
quite independent of the air, and
exhibiting a variety of intervals,
j In the best days of (Ireek song,
however, harmony seems to have
I been little more than a matter of
j octaves, fourths, and fifths.
[An ancient hymn to the muse
was here sung with simple harmo
nics arranged according to (ireek
theorists by Mr. Wells. |
Ancient notation, which was
based on the letters of the alphabet,
i was designed for twenty-one notes
within the octave, each original
note being followed by two supple
mentary ones. Quarter tones were
sung by the voice and played on
strings. [An illustration of (ireek
musical notation was given from
Euripides. ]
European music seems as bar
barous to Orientals as theirs does to

us, and therefore if we recovered
Greek music we should probably re
gard it with more curiosity than
admiration. And yet the recently
discovered hymn to Apollo, has, in
certain musical circles, as in Paris,
where it was sung by a large cho
rus, been received with great enthu
siasm. This hymn is the most
complete specimen that we possess
of ancient Greek music. It was
discovered at Delphi in May, 1893,
engraved on two blocks of marble.
It is written in the Dorian mode, in
the Cretic or Paeonian rhythm, and
in the peculiar time of five fourths.
[Mrs. Smith here sang the hymn,
accompanied by Mrs. Maitland at
the piano and an orchestra consist
ing of Miss Fletcher and Messrs.
Dully and Mr. Wells. The hymn
was beautifully rendered, and in
the opinion of many possesses great
charm and musical merit, though
it is over 2000 years old.]
