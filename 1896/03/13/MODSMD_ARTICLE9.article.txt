It is perhaps unnecessary to call
attention to the announcement
that Mr. Ira I). San key is to lead
the singing in the chapel Sunday
evening. No person in America
has done more for the cause of
religious song than has been ac
complished by Mr. Sankey. As co
worker with Moody, he brought
this branch of evangelism to a
prominence never before known,
and his appearance here will cer
tainly be welcomed and appreci
ated by all.
It is a matter for regret that Mr.
Lange's stay here has been cut
short. Saturday is the last day of
his stay with us, as he will then be
obliged to leave for Galveston to
join the Chicago team. In spite of
the short time he has worked with
the team, noticeable progress has
been made. The raw material
upon which we have to depend this
year is rapidly getting into shape,
and better still, the team is work
ing well together. Mr. Lange takes
away with him the hesl wishes not
only of the baseball men, but of the
whole student body.
One of the most hopeful tend
encies of the modern educational
system is the growth of the univer
sity extension ideas. Young men
and women leaving college are not
only called upon to take part in
the world's business, but the world
requires of them an active inter
est and participation in the solu
tion of its social and political prob
lems. Through extension clubs
and university settlements our
great cities are being invaded by a
vast body of college-bred men and
women whose influence in the cause
of reform will be powerful because
it is intelligent. No one can deny
that the annual injection into
society of hundreds of bright, in
telligent college graduates will
shove into the background cranks,
agitators, and fools and put all
reforms upon a sound, scientific
basis.
