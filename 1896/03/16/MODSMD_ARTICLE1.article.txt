# VISIONS.
## An Interesting- Sermon by Miss Anna B. Shaw. 
### 
Text, Acts xxvi, 19; "Whereup-l
on, O King Agrippa, I was not dis
obedient unto the heavenly vision."
Every age of the world has had i
its theological problem to solve.:
In some ages it has been impossi
ble for the people to decide their i
problem and they have resorted to
theories. Our age is eminently aj
practical one. Everything is ques
tioned from the utilitarian stand
point, and it, is my purpose to no
tice what I regard as the uppermost
of the questions being propounded.
It is, "What constitutes a Christ
ian? "
Some say to be a Christian one
must be born in a Christian land.
But we know that a man may be
born in a Christian land without I
being a Christian. Nor does being i
a member of a church entitle one
to lie called a Christian, as is some
times urged. We know that a man
may be a church member all his
life and never once feel the zeal of
the true Christian. Neither does
acting, of itself, constitute Christ.-]
ianity. A Christian must be all
three —must believe, must feel,
must act. These taken together
make up the Christian life.
Some years ago a dying agnostic,
at the earnest solicitations of his
wife, consented to a Christian bur
ial, but imposed these conditions:
there was to be no prayer, and in
the place of a sermon I was to read
an article which he designated, and
which 1 found to be a virulent at
tack upon Christianity. The arti
cle sought to show that Paul and
not Christ was the founder of the
Christian church; that Paul had
been prompted by a vision, and
that therefore the whole Christian
faith and church had for its founda
tion merely the vision of one man,
Paul. 1 had never thought of
this passage until 1 read it under
these circumstances. When I went
home 1 read it again, and now,
when I ask myself what is Christ
ianity, 1 invariably think of the
words of Paul: "I was not disobed
ient unto the heavenly vision."
What has made it possible for
reformers to stand out against the
whole world? They have all had a
vision. And the hope that one day
their vision would obtain, would
become a reality, has buoyed them
up and enabled them to withstand
the persecutions, the indignities,
and the sorrows to which they have
been subjected. Never in the
world has there been a reformer
who succeeded in his project with
out a vision. In the great anti
slavery convention in London there
rose a great discussion as to whet her
two women who had been invited
to the convention should be al
lowed to take a part in it. It was
finally decided that they might
look upon the proceedings from the
gallery, but that they could take
no part. These women were Eliza
beth Cady Stanton and Lucretia
Mott. As they rose to go up into
the gallery, a gentleman rose also
and took his place with them. A
great cry went out, for the gentle
man was no other than William
Lloyd Garrison, America's greatest
abolitionist. "We can not spare
you," they cried. Put Garrison

answered that there was nothing
gained by liberating one class if at i
the same time we enslaved another
class. That night those three peo
ple walked the streets together.
They saw a vision, a time when ,
women would be barred from noth
ing, and they determined to have j
that vision realized. They toiled and
suffered, and because of their toil
and suffering —because of the vis
ion that was behind their toil and!
suffering —you men and women
meet on equal footing, with the
same chances for success.
Every human being who has ac
complished anything has been the
follower of a vision. No one ever
accomplishes anything who is not
inspired by a vision. Let us take
it on the lowest plane, the material
plane.
My early home was on the sea
shore. As children we gathered
shells on the beach, and watched
the ships come in. The boys sooner
or later would sail away on those
ships, often when only ten years
old. Some had a vision, others
not. Some saw themselves the ad
miral of a great ship; others saw
themselves always before the mast.
In time the vision of the one be
came a reality: and the only differ
ence between the admiral and the
seaman, in the beginning, was that
one had a vision and the other had
not.
But visions have not always
been in the past. Before a single
stone of this University had been
laid, a man and a woman had had
a vision. They saw stone rise on
stone, they saw class after class
graduate, they had seen the minds
of the people growing everywhere.
And in all these days of weary
waiting, that woman could not
have stood the strain had she not
had a vision. Because of that vis
ion men and women in every state
shall rise up and bless those two.
If visions play such a part in the
material world, how much more po
tent it must be in the case of the
Christian. All the way through
Paul's life, because of his obedience
to his Master, he had put on the
likeness of the Master. This isen
tirely natural. We are molded by
the influences that surround us, by
the things that interest us. \\'e
may study the character of Christ
in its beauty and grandeur until
we actually become like him. And
to my mind to be a Christian is to
sit in the presence of this holy
picture, day after day, and be
changed into its likeness; at last
saying, *'i live, yet not I, but
Christ lives within me."
