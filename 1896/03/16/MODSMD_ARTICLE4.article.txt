# The 						San Jose Concert.
## 
### 
The Glee and Mandolin Clubs
have never given a better concert,
all things considered, than that
given in San .Jose Saturday night.
Not only was the concert the most
successful musically, but it was
equally successful from social and
financial standpoints. The credit
for this is due in no small degree to
the kindly interest taken in the
clubs by the patronesses. Through
their kindness the expenses were
reduced to a minimum figure, and
the social side was assured.
Musically both clubs surpassed
themselves. Indeed the whole con
cert was such an improvement upon
the one given upon the campus a
few evenings ago that it would be
difficult to recognize the work as
being from the same clubs. There
were no long waits between the
numbers, and the unevenness so
noticeable in the concert on the
campus was entirely lacking. The
(* lee Club was in exceptionally fine
voice. The parts sung in unison
are worthy of special praise.
As for the soloists, Dillon capti
vated the audience, and Abbott
sang a difficult solo with much fin
ish and expression. Wells has
never been heard to play better in
public.
The San Jose Mercury of Sunday
has the following to say:
"The Stanford University Man
dolin and Glee Clubs gave a mu
sicale at the Vendome last night,
which was attended by a large and
appreciative audience. The con
cert was one of the most pleasing
and successful given in San Jose
for many a day. As a rule San
Jose audiences are very cold and
critical, but last night was one of
the marked exceptions. Every
number was heartily encored, and
no special mention can be made of
any one number without the whole
program being considered, for
each number was delightfully ren
dered. The opening number, how
ever, may be mentioned as being
especially fine. The clubs are in
splendid condition. The men who
compose them have a pleasant way
of making the concert seem as if it
were being given in the parlors of
some wealthy entertainer. We
hope to hear the clubs soon again.
At the close of the entertainment
a dance was given. The patron
esses were Mrs. S. F. Lieb, Mrs. C.
T. Park, Mrs. Fred Plank, Mrs.
Frank V. Wright, Mrs. James V.
Kelley, Mrs. B. 1). Murphy, Mrs.
Maclaren, Mrs. Bowman, Mrs. J.
T. McGeoghegan, Mrs. W. T. Adel,
Mrs. J. il. Henry, and Mrs. C.
Burrel."
