# The 						Evolution of the Drama.

### 
Frederick Warde delivered a
lecture in the chapel today before a
large and appreciative audience, on
the rise of the drama and its vari
ous phases. Mr. Warde appeared
at his best, and his lecture was in
structive, witty, and eloquent. The
following is a brief extract, andean
not portray Mr. Warde's command
of language, his graceful gestures,
or his delicate humor.
The welfare of a community de
mands amusement. The drama is
the most popular form of intellect
ual amusement. The drama may
be traced back to early Grecian his
tory, 500 B. C., when it was
simply a song sung in the feast
of Bacchus. Thespus was the lirst
man to introduce an individual who
recited in verse a sequential story
which had formerly been sung by
choruses. Fifty years later Aeschy
lus introduced two persons with a
chorus. Sophocles and Euripides
later introduced an entire drama fix
/H't'smme and perfected, as they
thought, the drama. In the be
ginning music was the mother of
the drama, but it has in modern
times entirely disappeared.
The Romans received the Grecian
drama. It flourished fora time
and was used to provide amusement
for rich men's feasts. Then it to
tally disappeared.
Strange to say, the drama was
then revived under the fostering
care of the church and was used to
illustrate the mysteries and portray
the life and sufferings of Jesus
Christ. It was then discarded and
the church henceforth was antag
onistic to the drama. Then there
was a long interval of rest in which
the only signs of life were exhibited
in the troupes of mummers and
buffons. Not until the Elizabethan
age did the drama take its place as
an institution and an art.
Then arose Shakespeare—i innior
tal Shakespeare —and that galaxy of
friends and compatriots. Elizabeth
and James patronized it and the
drama flourished until the over
throw of Charles I and the Puritan
commonwealth. The drama was
restored, but it became depraved,
licentious, and vulgar. Thus it
continued until the Revolution,
after which, purified, it arose in
its might and strength. At that
time the prevailing plays were the
tragedy and the comedy. Then
arose Sheridan, Knowles, and his
comedies. Realism enters to the
disadvantage of art. The perform
ances came to he opened with a
light farce, followed by a heavy
tragedy, and closed with a low com
edy. French plays, dealing with
unsolvable social problems, were
then introduced, followed by the
burlesque, which ridiculed serious
subjects. Pantomimes arose, ex
pressing emotion without the aid
of the voice. Realistic drama
reached its height in the railroad,
water-tank, and race-horse plays.
Lastly, there is the farce-comedy,
which combines the worst elements
of the farce, comedy, and burlesque,
without pith or point, not even a
skeleton, and merely designed to
introduce specialties, which is the
most popular play of tlie present
day. Such is the condition of the
stage today.
Mr. Warde then discussed the

great actors of the world. Iloseius
and Aesops, of whom little is known,
acted in Rome. Richard Burbage
was the first Hamlet and acted
under the personal supervision of
Shakespeare. Betterton was the next
great actor, a man well advanced
in years and of some intellectual
attainments. David Gar rick at
tained greatness on the English
stage at a time when there was as
yet no scenery or modern stage art.
Edmund Kean, born in poverty,
dwarfed in stature, overcame his
disadvantages, sneers, and taunts
and attained great popularity with
the English people. Maclean was
the tirst. actor to give a correct in
terpretation to the character of Shy
lock. Master Hetty, a youth,
created a furore, but was not suc
cessful. Macready, a rival of Kean,
perfected the mechanics ofthestage
and introduced that school which
was governed by stage effect
and mechanics. Then appeared
the elder Booth of Jewish origin,
and with the Oriental intensity of
his race became one of the rivals of
Kean. The elder Booth emigrated
to America and thereby gave Edwin
Booth to America. Edwin Forrest,
a grand specimen of manhood both
intellectually and physically,
gained a reputation by his sweet
voice and delicate expression.
Edwin Booth inherited his
father's power of acting. His
methods were sinuous, graceful,
Italian, of the delicate serpentine
order. lie was subdued and soft
ened by the melancholy of his
nature. He endured with patience
the illness which ended fatally.
He was always a humble gentle
man, as grand a man as breathed
thebreath of life,who left behind him
a legacy to time which can never be
appreciated.
Edwin Booth was of humble ori
gin and attained success by work
only. He had an unbounded en
ergy, a, faculty for work, and a de
termination to succeed. It was a
case of mind conquering matter,
lie left behind him an honored and
respected name. His methods were
scholarly.
John McCullough was born in
Ireland and attained success on the
American stage. He was generous,
genial, and kind-hearted. Mc-
Cullougli's success came from his
heart, not by art.
Mr. Warde then gave an analy
sis of Hamlet's character, andgave
it as a Shakespearian axiom that
the key to a character could be
found in the first soliloquy. He
advised reading Shakespeare the
first time for the story, the second
time for his poetry, the third time
for his philosophy.
Mr. Warde closed with quotation
of the seven ages of man, but was
called back by tlie repeated ap
plause, and responded with a discus
sion of the character of Portia, who
he said was not a "new woman."
