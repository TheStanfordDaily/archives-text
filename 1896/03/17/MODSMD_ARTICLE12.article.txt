With today's issue the Daily
1'alo Alto appears in its enlarged
form, which change the manage
ment intends to maintain until the
close of the present semester. It
may he stated that this improve
ment is made possible largely
hy the energy of the business man
ager, whose efforts have resulted in
tilling the paper so full of business
that an enlargement is necessary to
give our patrons the news to which
they are entitled. Stanford has
boasted in the past of possessing
one of the nine daily college pa pert*
published in the United States;
she can now boast of possessing the
only college daily which appears
regularly with more than four
pages.
Among other innovations which
the management has decided upon
for the balance of the semester is
the publication of a serial story.
The one procured, a portion of
which will appear with each issue,
is considered by many authorities
to be one of the best college stories
written of late years by an American
story-writer. The story is of a
highly humorous character, and
the privilege of its use involves
considerable expense.
Arrangements are also under way
to obtain letters from Herkeley,
which we feel sure will prove inter
esting, and which will have the
further value of fostering friendly
relations between the two insti
tutions.
