Since our coach has left us, it is
of the utmost importance that the
baseball men practice faithfully for
the purpose of fixing the principles
of play and team work which the
coach has been endeavoring to im
press upon the men. Much of this
work depends upon the second
team. As in football, games are
necessary for real practice; but for
tlie last three or four days not
enough men have turned out to
form two nines. If inducements
must be offered for men to take
this beneficial exercise, what more
could be required than the contem
plated games for the second nine
against the preparatory schools of
the vicinity, and the possible, or
even probable, places on the Var
sity in this or succeeding years?

A discussion of great general in
terest to the student body liasj
arisen in connection with the;
matter of sweaters for the various
Varsity teams. Certain persons,
athletes in particular, are advo
cating a uniform sweater. That is, |
ihey desire that all members of any .
University team, whether it be
football, baseball, track athletics,
or tennis, shall be entitled to wear
the same kind of sweater.
The argument advanced in favor
of this plan is the encouragement
it would give to sports (he less pop-1
ular, notably, track athletics. On
the other hand it is argued that a
man who makes third place in an
intercollegiate field-day has not
trained so steadily, worked so
heavily, nor deserved so highly of
his college as the one who has made
the football team.
It seems that this last argument
ought certainly to be valid. These
sweaters are given as a badge of
service, a reward of devotion to the
University, and it is only fair that
he who has done the most should
receive the highest reward. Vet j
there are certain advantages in the!
way of appearance in a sweater
uniform in texture,color, arid shape.
Probably the solution most satis
factory to all parties would be the
adoption of a garment uniform in
these respects, but distinctive as re
gards tlie device. For example, a
large black "S" in Roman charac
ters might mark the football men;
a small white <k H'' in German
script the baseball men; and a
large white Roman "S" the track
men. This is probably the best of
all the plans proposed by our war
ring athletes and their interested
friends.
