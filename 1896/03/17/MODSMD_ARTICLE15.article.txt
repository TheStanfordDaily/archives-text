CHAPTER I.
TIIK NAME AM) FAMK OF BANGS.
A little* round stone lav in the'grass
in that portion of the Yale baseball
;■•round which is technically known as
left licld. The color of tin; stone was
blue. Its position was exactly right,
and the grass was just long enough
tii conceal it. The.se details had been
arranged by fate with her usual care
and foresight. \f the stone had not
been round it would have been use
less; and if the grass had not l.een
carefully nourished by rain and sun it
\\<uld not have concealed the stone,
anil somebody would have thiown it
away.
The decisive game between Harvard
ami Vale had progressed as far as the
last half of the ninth inning. Yale
needed two runs to win. Two of her
men were out, and two were on the
bases. Jack Hangs was at the bat and
a responsibility larger than two full
moons rested upon his shoulders. No
body who has not. been in a similar
; ituation can know how he felt.
If an individual with horns and a
tail, and carrying a blue flag as an evi
dence of good faith, had risen beside
.lack Hangs with the presidency of the
I nited States in one hand ami a base
hit in the other, Hangs would have
struck him over the head with his bat
for insulting him with the s. ggestion
of a choice. Hut that individual did
not rise beside Hangs. I'ci haps he was
out in left field watching' the little
blue stone.
The Harvard pitcher tried to re
member a short Latin prayer which
had once struck him as a good thing to
use in desperate emergencies. Fail
ing in this he made .several good reso
lutions. Then he launched the ball,
lie imparted to it a peculiar rotary mo
tion which caused it to leap up about a
foot just before it got to the batter.
This was done for the purpose of de
ceiving Hangs so that he would either
strike under the ball or semi ii up into
the air. Hangs' bat encountered the
ball with a sound like the crack of a
rille. The sphere soared aloft. A
dreadful din of voices rising alter it
seemed to buoy it up. All the pretty
gills in blue cried "Yale, Yale: ' 15.,t
as many of their brothers as knew the
game were silent and their hearts were
like lead.
The Harvard pitcher felt a strong
•.pasm of relief. His "rise" had done
the work. Hangs had batted a high
lly. The odds at that moment were a
thousand dollars to a cent against
Yule, for that lly would drop into left
field, where "infallible"' Hee kept
guard for Harvard. The pitcher was
as sure that Lee w> uld catch the ball
as lie was that it would not stay "pin
the sky.
Lee had to run in a little way to get
under the descending ball, lie was
pet feetly sure of it. The game was as
good as won. Already the cry of
"Harvard!" seemed to be drowning the
cry of "Yale!" In the tempest of
shouting lie distinguished his own
name with remarkable clearness. It
had rung out like that before in many
similar emergencies and a great cheer
had always followed it. He renum
bered suddenly that he would never
hear that thrilling call again. This
was his last effort in any college con
test. He had borne the red ii on his
breast for four glorious years, and this
was the end. Well, though it must

come, it could not come, better. He
was very glad of the final opportunity.
He could think of all these things as

lie ran, for the time seemed as long- as
a dream.
And then he trod upon the little blue
stone. It caught the metal plate on
his shoe and rolled like a wheel on the
hard ground. He plunged forvvardand
the ball went over his head.
Everybody in the world cried:
"Yale!"' The two blue-legged runners
crossed the plate. The game was lost
and won.
In an instant the crowd swept over
the lield. Above the frantic throng ap
peared nine figures borne upon the
shoulders of their friends. Each was
surrounded by a cheering, struggling
mass, and the biggest and the wildest
was around .lack Jiangs.
But out in the left field, alone, a fig
ure lay upon the ground. It was the
infallible Lee who had failed just
when there was no hope of retrieval.
They say he sobbed like a child. And
he was si?: feet and one inch tall, and
could litt a load of liay. Well, there's
a loser for every winner, t hough we do
not hear so much about him.
In the grand stand, meanwhile, the
enthusiasm had been enormous. The
vast crowd was upon its feet yelling
like inad people. Pretty girls percheo
upon the seats and screamed aloud
Some of them knew that Vale had woi
without being told: but most, of then
didn't and they just yelled beeansi
they couldn't help it. Among thost
who saw and understood was a pariicu
larly pretty girl named Florence
Lome. She; had kept a full score with
her own fair hand and had every point
recorded, with a few extra errors for
the Ilarvanls. For Florence was a
Yale girl through and through and
wore half a cable's length of blue rib
bon on her dress.
When it was all over she trembled to
think how near she had come to miss
ing that glorious culmina Lion. In her
excitement she would certainly have
fallen off the seat on which she was
standing if she had not steadied her
self by putting her hand upon the broad
shoulder of a man in front.of her. It was
a considerable sat isfaet ion to her 1 hat lie
was introduced almost immediately
afterward for it gave her a chance to
thank him. That was <pnte unneces
sary for he had been entirely oblivious
of the occurrence. If she had been
Chang, the Chinese giant, lie would not
have felt the weight at such a moment
"Oh. Mr. Hangs!"sheexclaimed when
the apology wnsout of the way, "wasn't
it perfect ly thrilling?"
"It. was indeed," he rejoined with
what, remained to him by way of a
voice after the cheering. "Did you en
joy it, Mrs. Lome?"
