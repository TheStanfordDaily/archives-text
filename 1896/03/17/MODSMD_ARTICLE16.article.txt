The question was addressed to a
pretty, motherly woman who stood be
side Florence.
'"I'm afaid I didn't appreciate all of
it," she replied. "Hut I'm glad Yale
won. I have a son in college."
"Poor .1 iminy!" exclaimed Florence,
"lie's an enthusiast, hut he can't play
hail. He didn't even make the fresh
nian nine this year."
"Perhaps he will develop," said
Italics, sympathetically. "I've known
men to tail in the freshman year and
<lo very well afterwards."
"Were you interested in athletics
when you were in college, Mr. Hangs?"
asked Mrs. Lome.
".Mother!" The girl's tone was full
of reproachful pity. "Read your coun
try's history. Everybody in the world
has heard of Mr. Harry Hangs, lie
was the greatest back-stop Yale ever
had. and played football, too. He wa.-
the man who broke Harvey Duff's nose
in the great slugging game of 'SO. And
that saved the game because Duff was
the best ground-gainer that Harvard
had. Isn't that so, Mr. Hangs?"
"Well, in the matter of Duff's nose."
said Mr. Hangs, "I'm afraid I'll have
to plead guilty. The remainder I leave
to the historian."
"Mother is just beginning to learn,"
said the girl, "but she is doing very
well. You must know, mother, that
Mr. Hangs' family has been very dis
tinguished at Yale. They have done
more for the university than any
other."
Hangs, who had been in high spirits,
became suddenly gloomy.
"I'm afraid our day is over," he said
"My cousin .lack graduates this year.''
'"Can't he go to one of the profes
sional schools'?"
"lie's been through 'em all. He's
been in college nine years, but he's got
to go now. And he's the last hope of
the family.''
"Hut there's your brother!" ex
claimed Florence, with sudden recollec
tion. "1 heard that he was going to
enter this fall."
The gloom on Hangs' face became a
dozen times darker.
"It's a hard thing to speak of," he
said, "but I'm afraid my brother is a
total failure."
"Oh, what a pity!" exclaimed Mrs.
Lome. "Can't he pass the examina
tions'.'"
A grim and mournful smile over
spread Harry Hants' face.
