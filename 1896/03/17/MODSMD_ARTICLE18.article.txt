The financial responsibility of
the athletics at Indiana University
is borne by the university.
Vale spent $54,000 on athletics
last year, of which $10,000 was sub
scribed by undergraduates.
The Harvard Lampoon'* twenti
eth anniversary was celebrated on
Monday evening by a dinner at
which fifty editors were present.
I>y the recent semi-annual ex
amination at Annapolis forty-eight
men were found to be deficient and
eighteen were recommended to be
dropped.
The gross receipts of the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania Athletic As
sociation in football were58(5,250.17,
the expenditures $18,591.85, leav
ing a net balance of $22,658.22.
The late Theodore Runyon gradu
ated from Vale in 1842. He re
ceived the degree of doctor of laws
from Wesleyan University in 1807,
from Rutgers in 1875, and from
Vale in 1882.
The Harvard football manage
ment has arranged a series of seven
fortnightly football talks by prom
inent football men. The subject of
the first is: '"Practical lessons from
the development of the Yale team
of 1895."
The juniors and seniors of Wes
leyan recently had a serious class
row. The trouble arose over an at
tempt of the seniors to destroy the
straw hats belonging to the juniors
and which were decorated with
class colors.
A game has been arranged to
take place between Vale's varsity
team and a graduate team, of which
the coaches will form the greater
part. This will give the varsity an
opportunity to size up the men,
particularly the pitchers.
Haver lord College has swung
into line with Boston University
and a number of other institutions
in the matter of allowing editorial
work on the college paper to count
toward a degree. About two hours
credit per term is allowed.
The Vale freshman crew will row
the eight-oared crew of the Univer
sity of Wisconsin. The race is due
to the exclusion of the Vale fresh
man crew from the freshman race
between Columbia, Harvard, Cor
nell, and the University of Pennsyl
vania.
At a recent meeting of the Cor
nell faculty it was resolved "that a
student against whom there is a
condition upon an entrance re
quirement be not allowed to register
fora second year's subject without
special permission from the
faculty."
Harvard intends to hold an inter
collegiate bicycle meeting this
spring, on its new track, which is
three laps to the mile. The usual
events have been arranged. The
college scoring the most points will
be presented with a silk banner,
and gold, silver, and bronze medals
will be given to first, second, and
third, respectively. This meet is
the result of a desire to place inter
collegiate bicycle racing on an in
dependent footing.
