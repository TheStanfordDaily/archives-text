of square dealing, low prices, and

specialty of gentlemen's furnishing
goods. Our readers will do well by
patronizing "The Hastings."
The attention of the students and
our readers in general is called to
the advertisement of A. G. Spald

and summer line of baseball and
athletic supplies is unsurpassed,
their trade mark legend "Spalding
Highest Quality" on their goods
being absolute guarantee that the
articles bearing it are the best that
can be produced. The managers of
track and baseball teams would do
well to secure estimates from this
firm before placing their spring
orders. A handsome catalogue will
be mailed free to any student send
ing his address.
