# "Mob-Mind," by Prof. E. A. Ross.

### 
One of the most interesting chap
ters in the study of social psychol
ogy that is now fascinating many
observers is the psychology of
crowds.
In examining social life among
animals one is struck by the won
derful susceptibility of the members
of a herd or Hock to the contagion
of feeling. By long association an
imals become so attuned to each
other in spirit that when an emer
gency arises there is no disagree
ment, no pulling in different ways.
Whatever be the experience that
befalls them, all the members of a
Hock feel it almost at once. In
their psychic life there seems to be
nothing answering to discussion or
deliberation, yet let anything hap
pen and a wave of excitement
surges over the herd, followed by
instant and unanimous response.
The facile obedience of gregarious
animals to suggestions from their
fellows is not hard to account for
when we recall the harsh condi
tions of animal existence. They
are the least formidable in natural
powers of defense, hence most de
pendent on mutual aid and sup
port; consequently a marvelous
power of comprehension and sym
pathy, and most alert response to
signs.
It is this phenomenon of psychic
contagion as exhibited among men
that I refer to by the term "mob
mind." 1 fere we have an audience
of a thousand people listening to
Salvini's Othello, and at the close
bursting into wild applause. This
looks like complete unanimity; but
if you could test these thousand in
dividuals by having them hearSal
vini one by one, you might find
that seven hundred applauded from
frantic approval, while the remain
ing three hundred applauded be
cause the rest did. Now this is an
artificial unanimity and must be
distinguished from a natural una
nimity. From scores of other ex
amples we arrive at the conclusion
that there is a tendency in a mass
of people for the sentiment or idea
that becomes common to become
universal, which tendency may be
termed mob-mind.
Not all disorderly, lawless, or
violent crowds are built up in this
way. The mob in New Orleans
that lynched thirteen Italians a
few years ago did not show mob
characteristics. There was pecfeet
unanimity, because each man in it,
on seeing or hearing of Chief Hen
nessy's assassination, was impressed
in just the same way and lired with
a desire for vengeance. This kind
of unanimity is not a mark of mob
mind.
Besides the unanimity that
comes to a mass of people by like
impressions, there is a one-niind
edness that is a result of discussion.
Psychology recognizes that even a
human being is more or less ame
nable to the sway of ideas or feel
ings that reach him from without.
As in company, where one yawns
the rest follow suit. Every sugges
tion from without tends to realize
itself in you, unless you react upon
and oppose it.
A mob is irrational, because it is
dominated by the impressions of
then:"i i.t; tickle, because the
guMi . of reason and prin

ciple being overthrown, the mass
becomes as a weathercock to chang
ing conditions; evil, because self
control is lost. It is shameless, be
cause each man is supported by
knowing he has the approval of all
the'rest; fearless, because the sense
of fusion begets the illusion of ir
resistible power; cowardly, because
actuated not by stern purpose but
by mere suggestion; and cruel, be
cause of the absence of all personal
responsibility. At the same time
it is generous, even sentimental, be
cause of high emotional tension.
Mobs form more readily in the
lower strata of population. It is
the city populations that form true
mobs.
The unfitness of mob-mind for
serious humane purposes proves it
to be a form of disease. The Amer
icans can not be held to be much
given to these gusty passions of
senseless, swaying throngs of men,
and the soundness of the American
public is vindicated by the amount
of control that can be accorded in
this country to public opinion.
The mob-mind crops up in unex
pected forms, such as fads, crazes,
and fashions.
With the railroad and telegraph,
the enterprising daily and the cheap
magazine, people are brought into
each other's presence, as it. were.
The modern mob is represented by
the thousands who greedily devour
daily reports of the Durrant trial,
a graphic prize-fight, etc.
The instability of mental state,
now so characteristic of many of
the'fairly intelligent reading public,
is a sign of weak inhibitive power.
The fault is not with the intellect;
it is a defect of the will. Knowl
edge comes, but wisdom lingersâ€”
I the power to choose between ideas
does not keep pace. Chief among
the agencies responsible for the i ise
j of crazes is the sensational news
paper. In our large cities we find
hordes of excitable people who
could not survive at all if thrown
i among primitive conditions where
I they would have to fall back on
their own mental resources. It is
said popular will, will inevitably
acquire mob qualities. li' we are
to vindicate the dignity of popular
government, despite the upbuilding
I of our cities, it will be only by de
veloping the burgher type in place
j of the volatile rif-raf.
The remedy for this degeneracy
J of the will is the building up of
strong characters, and while teach
ing the subordination of the one to
the welfare of the whole. It is
partly due to social foolishness that
people have not been more verte
brate than they are. Society,
while powerless to prevent all sorts
of leeches from fastening on it, is
all the time running after people
and shying stones at them because
they do not conform to its \Vays.
S>nt the main root of the imitation
we have is not coercion but weak
ness ot character, and can be cured
only by that which strengthens
character. We need in this country
more men of a higher education.
I hit how far should this resis
tance to suggestion go? Moments of
mob-mind are in many cases the
most precious possessions we have.
To every experience there is a feel
ing that one should enrich his life
by trying to get that feeling. This

is the doctrine of impression
ism.
Responsiveness, capacity for com
mon feeling, openness to suggest
ion, love of accord, belong to the
social man and should not be dis
couraged. We should have the
power of self-control so that we
may withstand or yield to the in
fection of mood as circumstances
require. One can always yield,
but if to take the tome of your
neighbors means to forfeit your
common sense or your conscience,
then test the worth of a robust in
dependence that can stand alone
against the world.

The fault is not with the intellect;
it is a defect of the will. Knowl
edge comes, but wisdom lingersâ€”
I the power to choose between ideas
does not keep pace. Chief among
the agencies responsible for the i ise
j of crazes is the sensational news
paper. In our large cities we find
hordes of excitable people who
could not survive at all if thrown
i among primitive conditions where
I they would have to fall back on
their own mental resources. It is
said popular will, will inevitably
acquire mob qualities. li' we are
to vindicate the dignity of popular
government, despite the upbuilding
I of our cities, it will be only by de
veloping the burgher type in place
j of the volatile rif-raf.
The remedy for this degeneracy
J of the will is the building up of
strong characters, and while teach
ing the subordination of the one to
the welfare of the whole. It is
partly due to social foolishness that
people have not been more verte
brate than they are. Society,
while powerless to prevent all sorts
of leeches from fastening on it, is
all the time running after people
and shying stones at them because
they do not conform to its \Vays.
S>nt the main root of the imitation
we have is not coercion but weak
ness ot character, and can be cured
only by that which strengthens
character. We need in this country
more men of a higher education.
I hit how far should this resis
tance to suggestion go? Moments of
mob-mind are in many cases the
most precious possessions we have.
To every experience there is a feel
ing that one should enrich his life
by trying to get that feeling. This

is the doctrine of impression
ism.
Responsiveness, capacity for com
mon feeling, openness to suggest
ion, love of accord, belong to the
social man and should not be dis
couraged. We should have the
power of self-control so that we
may withstand or yield to the in
fection of mood as circumstances
require. One can always yield,
but if to take the tome of your
neighbors means to forfeit your
common sense or your conscience,
then test the worth of a robust in
dependence that can stand alone
against the world.
