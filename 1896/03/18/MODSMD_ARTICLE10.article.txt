Few lectures ever given in
the chapel exceeded in interest
that delivered last evening by
Dr. Ross. The subject. 'â– .Mob
mind." was treated in that
scholarly manner characteristic of
the speaker, and every person who
attended was well repaid for the
time spent there. Unfortunately
the lecture was not given as much
publicity through these columns as
it deserved, and the audience was
few in number on that account. It
will be a pleasure to those who
failed to hear it to know that the
discussion will be repeated next
Friday before the class in .Evolu
tion.
