The sudden indifference mani
fested 1 >y the baseball men for all
pract ice is astonishing at this time
of the season, and is unequaled in
the history of our athletics, unless
we except the apathy which be
came apparent during last football
season. Now we have no Waiter
Camp to arouse flagging energies
and interest; the men must do it
for themselves. Let the players re-'
member that in accepting the
coaching and training of Mr. Lange
they laid themselves liable to one
great responsibility. i. e., of assist
ing the gaint here in every possible
manner. It is palpably unfair and
unjust to accept the services of the
coach a lid ca plain for severa I weeks,
and then at the most critical mo
ment, when the coach has departed,
to decline to attend the regular
practice games. m
With the training the players
have received, careful and conscien
tious practice would result in Stan

ford's winning tlie championship
again, this year; but the pennant
will go to Berkeley as sure as fate,
unless the players come to their
senses, and that pretty suddenly.
