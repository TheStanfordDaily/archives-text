"".Mother doesn't understand these
things." said Florence. gently. "or she
would be just as sorry as I am. Can't
your brother do anything at ail?"
"lie won't try," said Bangs, bitterly.
"He'd rather read Greek."
"Oh. what a shame. Can't you do
something to inlluenee him?"
"That's my only hope. You see the
trouble is that 1 haven't had a chance
at him. Every time lie's been home
from school in the last two years, I've
been away, and 1 haven't seen him in
that time. But I've written constantly
and father has done what he could.
It's all no use. Lawrence is big enough.
I'm told, and perfectly sound, but he
hasn't the head for it. lie can't do
smytiling but study. I tell you it's a
hard blow to the governor."
There was silence fora moment out
of deference to Mr. Bangs' sorrow.
Then the young man said:
"It's ungracious to begin an ac
quaintance by unloading one's burdens.
You must pardon me. <>n such a day
as tiiis I can't help brooding on it. To
think tliat a brother of mine—"
He broke off suddenly, and turned
his face away. I*" lore nee was on the
verge of tears, but she compressed her
pretty lips and said:
"This simply shan't be. Introduce
your brother to me, Mr. Bangs, and 1 11
talk to him. We'll set Jimmie after
him too. Ah. here he comes. lie
slipped away the instant that run came
in to look out for our carriage."'
•Imimic Borne was made acquainted
with the famous athlete whom he re
garded with veneration. He would
have remained there till the following
day im ibing wisdom from this em
inent authority, but Mr. Bangs dis
creetly took himself away.
As lie walked across the field tliro.igh
the crowd now rapidly thinning there
was a light of hope in his face and he
whispered to him: i•! 112:
"If my Iv -I her could fall in love with
such a girl as .Miss Borne it might make
a man of him."
