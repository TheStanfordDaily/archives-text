''Let her go. It's a bargain. I'm [
\vi<l yer!"
Paddy pot up and stretched liis long
limbs, lie looked around at the fa
miliar trees, and the monument on the
hill. He wanted to see whether they
were all there. It seemed more proba
ble to him that they would be absent,
and that he would find himself in bed
somewhere, and just waking" from a
dream.
Hut the common looked no different
from its ordinary. The trees were
waving gently under the blue sky. His
late companions in the game were
scattered about on the grass. And be
fore him stood a person whom he
vaguely suspected to be the boss of the
ward — the highest dignitary with
whose office he was familiar — who
wanted to give him a lot of money just
for going to school.
It looked like a good thing. Paddy
reflected with joy that the schools
were all closed and that his work could
not begin till he had had a taste of his
wanes.
The sudden surprise had accentuated
the dryness in Paddy's throat.
"'lf yer got the price o' two beers,''he
began.
"No, sir," said Hangs. "I'll attend
to the outside of you. It's more con
spicuous. The hrst thing you need
most, is a suit of clothes."
Of that first day of his new life
Paddy retains a most confused recollec
tion. Ho remembers a batii some
where in a place that was so hot it
made his head ache. There was a
little room where he undressed, and
when he got back to it he found a lot
of new clothes. There was not only a
brand new suit, but there were some
articles to put on under it, quite super
fluous as he protested, in warm
weather. Then he went to store;
where people bowed to Mr. Haul's, and
never mentioned paying for anything,
which led Paddy to beL ve that his
benefactqr was connected with the po
lice.
Afterwards they went to a big house
where there were rooms which re
minded I'addy of the show windows oi
furniture tores.
"You'll live here for the present,'"
said !tangs.
"Me? In dis place? Say, I'd be
afraid o" breakin' some thin'."
Hangs laughed.
"Don't you worry about that. These 1
are some rooms where I live when my
father's house is closed in the summer.
It is open now so you'll be by yourself
lames." he continued, nddres ipg a j
servant, "see that Mr. (VTooJe ha
whatever he wants, (ret his meal
from the St. Vincent. We'll have din
ner now."
Hie re never was anything like that
dinner. Whateverhei'rht of I ixury Pad
dy may attain in the future, he can I
never know the joy of iiothcr .such no- '
petite. Immediately after dinner he ■
fell asleep in a chair, ai. l when in j
invoke Hangs ha l gone away, an.! I
•lames was inquiring whether Mr. '
O'T'tolc desired anything, more before j
going to lied.
"I'd like to eat some more," said Pad
dy. "but I can't."
Ten minutes later he was asleep
a train, and haunted by a fear, even in
his drew ins, that he might awake on
the grass under a tree in !><>st >n Com
mon.
