# Baseball Game.
## 
### 
The baseball game between the
Santa Clara College and Stanford
on the diamond at 2:80 tomorrow
afternoon promises to be one of the
best this season. As the visiting
nine is the one that defeated our
team two weeks ago, and as this is
the last game before vacation, a
large number should be present.
An admission of twenty-five cents
will be charged to help defray the
expenses of the game.
