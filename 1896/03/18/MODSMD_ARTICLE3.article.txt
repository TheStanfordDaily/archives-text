; a week ago is rapidly drawing to a

with Cochran,'s)6. The scores of the
sets were 9—7 and 7-5. Those

solation series, and the winners of
I the first two places will contest
! with Freeman and I'icher, last
j semester's champions, for places on
i the team which will represent us
I against Berkeley this year. Ac
cording to a ruling made by the
Tennis Club the winners of previ
ous tournaments do not have to

remained out of the present contest.
