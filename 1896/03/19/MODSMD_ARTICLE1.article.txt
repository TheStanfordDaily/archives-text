# Prof. Abbott's Lecture.
## 
### 
There was a large audience last
night to hear Prof. Nathan Abbott
of the Law Department on the
"Dedications of law books." Ow
ing to lack of space it is impossible
to do Prof. Abbott's excellent and
entertaining effort anything like
justice, but the following is a brief
summary of his remarks:
The dedications of books are a
valuable criterion of the taste of
the age in which they are written.
How the host ornaments his portico
or stands there to bid us welcome
is a foretaste of the entertainment
we may expect beyond the thres
hold. And the dedications and
prefaces of Ijooks are much the
same sort of standard.
Selecting as a single illustration
of writers of the 17th century
one is impressed with the venalty
of many of the authors of that age.
Hooks were dedicated to the rich
fora fee to the author. The more
the adulation in the dedication the
greater the fee. In a book called
" Dedication to a great man concern
ing dedications'" the author des
cribed dedications as "Hills of ex
change drawn by the witty upon
the great and payable at sight,"
and continuing says: 'T have
known an author praise an earl
for twenty pages together though
he knew nothing of him but that
he had money to spare. He made
him wise, just, and religious for no
reason in the world but in hope to
find him charitable; and gave him
a most bountiful heart because he
himself had a most empty stomach."
Prior to the 16th century the re
ports of the law courts were largely
in manuscript. About the middle
of the 17th century such reports
were unearthed, printed, and, to
give them standing, attributed
wherever possible to lawyers of rep
utation. The law reports between
1648 and 1088 are therefore unre
liable.
Let us now turn to some specific
dedications. That of Dyer's re
ports is in the form of a Latin poem,
entitled "A song to the reader."
The dedication of Plowden's reports,
In' who was called by Coke "Master
Plowden, a grave man and singu
larly well learned," begins quaintly
as follows: "Edmund Plowden, to
the students of the Common Law of
England and especially to his com
panions of the Middle Temple who
wisheth increase of learning."
Should any one feel sceptical
that in a dedication one may find
a criticism of the age in which it
was written, let him compare works
of two ages. The dedications of
law books are sometimes store
houses of information of the men
and methods of their time.
Hy law books I mean law reports
and treatises. Early law reports
were not the work of men appointed
for the duty who had means and
access to all briefs and opinions of
the court, but by students of law
who took notes from their exper
ience. These notes were sometimes
taken by the judge and were dif
ficult to decipher.
In 1 ();•)'.I Sir Francis Hacon pub
lished his Maxims, and it is inter
esting to compare his epistle dedi
catory with the dedications of his
great rival, Lord Coke's edition of
Littleton's Tenures.

''Deo,
Patriae,
Tibi."
After this followed Haeon's
dedication to the queen.
Carter's Reports (1688) had the
following dedication:
"To the Hamsters and Students
of the Honorable Society of the In
ner Temple.
" The Antiquity and Usefulness of
Reporting Cases at Common Law
is so well understood by those who
have been conversant therein that
it were a superfluous Address in
one to treat of either to Persons of
your Profession: And it is by Rea
son of the Grave Deliberation and
Solemnity, always used and ac
companied in the arguing of them
that the Sages of our Law have so
constantly had so great esteem and
veneration for them.
"Gentlemen, 1 present to you
Cases which were thoroughly ar
gued by Grave Sergeants at the Bar
(before they received Resolutions
at the Pencil) in the time of that
Learned C.J. Hridgman(afterwards
Lord Keeper).
"1 doubt not but you will find
most of the Arguments (both at
the Har and Bench) to be closely
and usefully managed, and the
Cases therein Cited to be perti
nently applied: For nothing spoils
a good argument more than to
Muster up many Important cita
tions alo vole and at Random. In
the Argumentof C..J. Hridgman me
thinks 1 find that Eviceratio
causae,as the Roman orator calls it,
—An exact Anatomy of the case and
a dexterous piercing into the very
Bowels of it. A sudden and un
methodical plunging over Head
and Ears into an Argument is as
rude as unprofitable; and it was no
small Commendation of an emi
nent Professor of our Law and one
that afterwards was advanced to
the Highest office a person of that
Profession can be Capable, That he
always argued like a Lawyer and a
Gent leman. Hut I shall digress no
further.
"Gentlemen, 1 beg pardon for my
lapses and Mistakes, and shall sub
mit the whole to your judgment.
S. C."
