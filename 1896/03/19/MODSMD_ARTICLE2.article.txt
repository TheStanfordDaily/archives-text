This sweater proposition has been
misunderstood. It is claimed by
its opponents that it is a movement
I on the part of the track athletes
against the football men. On the
j contrary it is a movement for the
general good of University athletics,
and not a scheme on the part of a
few to encourage one branch of
sport at the expense of another.
The theory on which it is based is
j that all men who represent their
college in certain recognized annual
athletic contests should be consid
ered as athletic equals. It is
claimed for the footba 11 team that
j they work harder and obtain greater
honor than do the other I'niversity
athletes, and that they therefore
should be recognized as a, distinct
ci'iss. It is admitted that they ex-

pend a great amount of physical
force in their work; but is the small
man who has quick muscles and is
therefore a sprinter, a baseball
pitcher, or a tennis player,and who
wins recognition for his university
in one of these lines, to be consid
ered inferior to his heavier muscled
companion who has made the foot
ball team? What possible reason
is there for such a distinction?
There is none made in the eastern
colleges, at Harvard, at Yale, at
Pennsylvania, at Columbia, at
Michigan. It is claimed that the
football team earns more money,
creates a more general interest, and
is therefore of more importance in
university athletics than are the
other teams. While this is true at
present as regards interest and
money, it is not owing to the super
ior athletic ability ot' the men com
posing the team, but to the natural
interest and excitement of the game
to outsiders.
It is openly avowed by many of
the football men that they do not
wish to be classed with the track
athletes, with the baseball team, or
with the tennis players. They say,
Give us our due and give them
theirs, and if in time they become
of more importance than we, they
may have the credit. This view
seems to be narrow and selfish. Is
this the spirit we wish to foster in
this University? Is each individ
ual to go into athletics for his own
personal glory? Distinction is re
pugnant to the idea of Stanford
University. All that is asked is
that there be uniformity andequal
itv in our athletics. 1). T. G.
