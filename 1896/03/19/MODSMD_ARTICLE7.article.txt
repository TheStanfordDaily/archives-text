The great interest which the
student body has manifested over
the "sweater" question shows con
clusively the desire of the students
at large to establish good and per
manent institutions and traditions,
now that our future is assured. One
direction in which some of this en
ergy might be directed is in estab
lishing a trophy room in which the
trophies won by the Stanford teams
—football, baseball, tennis, debat
ing, and track—might he preserved
as a permanent memorial to the fu
ture classes of the past successes.
Such a room is kept with the great
est care by nearly all the eastern
colleges, and it is certainly dis
graceful to see silver trophies, won
by the earnest efforts of our ath
letes, floating round Encina and do
ing duty at undergraduate "feeds."
We are busily making history
now, and every effort should be
made to preserve it for future gen
erations.
