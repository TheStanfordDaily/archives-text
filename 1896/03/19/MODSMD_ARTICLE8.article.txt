Judging from expressions heard
about the quadrangle and in the
class-rooms, the vacation which be
gins at noon tomorrow is going to
be characterized for the most part
by a perfect epidemic of zealous
study. Everywhere one hears of
the intention to accomplish great
things (luring the holidays. Theses
are to be written, set papers worked
up, whole shelves of books de
voured; and —except, of course, in
Encina and Itoble —the proverbial
"midnight oil" is going to "catch
it" as it has seldom done before.
Work is all very well in its place.
It is what we are here for. Hut it
is a pity that so Large a percentage
of students, either through their
own fault or as a result of circum
stances over which they have no
control, should be obliged to toil
and moil through a period which
all should set apart for rest and di
version. Any one who has worked
as he should have done during the
past two months and a half needs
the coming vacation for phj'sical
and mental recuperation, for free
dom from restraint, for life in the
open air, for the indulgence of his
own sweet will. Hound about us
in these beautiful spring days the
mountains and forests are calling
to neglectful humanity. Hut too

few can find time to accept the
invitation. The majority of us
are obliged, for one reason or an
other, to remain in the dingy re
cesses of a library or (he solitude
of a cheerless boarding-house, to
thumb dull volumes and only
dream of the blue sky, the green
hills, and the golden poppies. A
few even prefer to do so, but hap
pily not many. Now why can't we
all make up our mind that the va
cation is not to be all work? Even
if we must accomplish sovie tasks,
let us get out of our ruts fora little
while and come back to work with
renewed hearts and minds.
