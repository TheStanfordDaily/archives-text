CIlAl'Ti:ii III.
T1IK TlIOIiN'Y I'ATII OF ICNOWl.F.DOE.
Harry lt:i;i:r ■ went to his elab and
hottliu largest cigar ou sale there.
Tills wws a m;m that he intended : 1
consume .mi una unlly large amount of
bruin ti.v uc 1.; thought.
I It* devoted all of it. to Paddy O'Toole,
and at the end of an hour he s 'mined
np the result in the words: "lie's a
wonder."
So completely had lie given himself
to the subject on lia. .d that he was
oblivious of 11>e presence of other
men by the window where lie sat smok
ing; ami lie pronounced the words
aloud.
"Who's a wonder?" asked an ex-Har
vard baseball player of some note who
sat near.
"We won't mention any names," re
sponded Bangs, "but 1 don't, mind tell
ing you that the person to whom 1 re
fer is destined to give a lot of trouble
to the pupils of i)r. Eliot's school for
boys out on the banks of the Charles."
"I know who it is." said the Harvard
man. "it's your brother. Aiu I right?"
But, bangs was not ready t > give any
information about ruddy, lie simply
winked and said nothing. The remark,
however, had touched him on the raw.
"I wish il w is my brother," lie mut
tered as he 1 urned a way. "When that
Irishman get.-, to Yale lie will make a
name for himself that will live a hun
dred years. And Lawrence will never
be ho;: rd of "
Tiii last, reflection put Hangs in a
very bad temper, and he went home and
lay awake two hours thinking of his
brother. *
lie was at his bachelor quarters early
next m< irninprepared for an important
interview with Paddy O'Toole. He
found that young man in a sweet
dream of peace.
"Come turn out!"" called I'angs, cheer
ily. "it's time for breakfast."
"Breakfast?" cried i utiuy, awake in
a moment. "Say, do 1 get some? Is
that si 1 night?"
"Of course it is. As soon as you've
had your bath—"
"Mi bath? An' me that was washed
only yesterday? Say, do 1 wash every
day? Am I a Chinese laundry?''
"You're a civilized Christum now,"
rejoined Hani's, "and the sooner you
begin to act like one the better. Per
haps 1 didn't make you understand yes
terday, inst what has happened to you.
The case stands this way. You've got
the making of a great ball player in
you. Now, I'm a Yale man."
"What's that? Deni fellies what
plays football, and slugs der heads
offn each other?"
"Well, that's part of it. Yale is a
college in New Haven, and tlioi if us
who have been there are bound to see
Yale win every time. You've got to go
to Yale and play on the nine. I don't
want to give you a big head, but it's a
fact that you handle a baseball better
than any other fellow I ever saw, and
I've seen many a good one. Now, rich
men give money to colleges. I'm w ill
ing to do that, but I want to be sure
that the money is spent in a way that
will do the college 1 ine good. There
fore I'm going to ud it myself. I'm
going to spend "ding you there.
It's a great ty for you, but
you'll lr 11 by hard study,
and ' fin right now."
■' sy complacently,

"the schools is all closed. I heard a
kid say so."
Bangs laughed.
"You won't go to school yet. I'll be
your teacher for the present. Heaven
knows 1 don't like the job, but I'll do it
for the sake of the college. Now get
up, and eat your breakfast, for you've
got a hard day's work before you."
Bangs went out into the parlor and
presently Paddy appeared, wearing the
suit of clothes which Bangs had pur
chased on the previous day, and carry
ing his shirt collar in his hand.
"Had luck to it!", exclaimed Paddy,
throwing it on the floor. "It cuts me
t'r< >at."
Bangs ordered him to put it on. Pad
dy deinured. 1 Ie said he was willing to
v> ear it <.11 Sundays, but he thought that
seven days a week of it was "crowdin'
der limit."
".No collar, no breakfast," said Bangs
at last, and that carried the point.
It is only fair to say that Paddy, prop
erly dressed, and with his mouth closed,
was a good-looking youth. His skin
was unusually white, despite his out-of
door life, and his face was thm to
match his figure which was like a lit
tle man on stilts. But his features
were strong and his eyes bright and
steady. Altogether he had a good
head for a student, if there had been
anything in it. Ilisgreatstrength lent
a certain grace to his movements,
thnigli one would have expected him
to be as awkwaul as a young calf.
It is impossible within the limits of
this narrative to describe the educa
tional process to which Paddy was sub
jected. Naturally he did not learn
much on the lirst day, but Harry Hangs
iiill. r i hose of us who have had the ad
vantages of early training do not real
ise what its total absence implies.
Bangs had never been a student. He
had studied just enough to get an idea
of the vast number of things which
one can know. He had a general no
tion that somebody knew them all. but
he had never considered the possibility
of the existence of a person who did
not know any of them.
We forget, sometimes, that infinity
is just as long one way as it is the
other. It is as hard to grasp the real
meaning of nothing as it is to under
stand everything.
That was what was the matter with
the education of Paddy O'Toole. It
was impossible to get back to the place
where it ought to begin. It is all very
well to talk of beginning a child's edu
cation with that of his grandfather,
but what ire you going to do if the old
gentleman is dead?
In the course of a week Bangs had
not found anything to teach Paddy,
because there was always something
which he ought to learn before that.
And so at random he started him 011
Hngli.sh grammar. Now, a merciful
.'rovidi'tice, which sends the mumps
and things of that kind to us at an age
when we are unable to comprehend
the horror of them, has wisely made
the same provision in regard to the ail
vent of grammar into our lives. There
are e.v < ;'lions, of course, and every
body must have an idea how very bad
an adult case of mumps would be. Im
agine grammar, then, at the age of
seventeen an age when most of us
have had it, and forgotten all about it.
Paddy O'Toole thought that he was
going to die of it. He contracted it
from a man named Brown. They say
