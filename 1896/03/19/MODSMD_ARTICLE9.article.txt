CIlAl'Ti:ii III.
T1IK TlIOIiN'Y I'ATII OF ICNOWl.F.DOE.
Harry lt:i;i:r ■ went to his elab and
hottliu largest cigar ou sale there.
Tills wws a m;m that he intended : 1
consume .mi una unlly large amount of
bruin ti.v uc 1.; thought.
I It* devoted all of it. to Paddy O'Toole,
and at the end of an hour he s 'mined
np the result in the words: "lie's a
wonder."
So completely had lie given himself
to the subject on lia. .d that he was
oblivious of 11>e presence of other
men by the window where lie sat smok
ing; ami lie pronounced the words
aloud.
"Who's a wonder?" asked an ex-Har
vard baseball player of some note who
sat near.
"We won't mention any names," re
sponded Bangs, "but 1 don't, mind tell
ing you that the person to whom 1 re
fer is destined to give a lot of trouble
to the pupils of i)r. Eliot's school for
boys out on the banks of the Charles."
"I know who it is." said the Harvard
man. "it's your brother. Aiu I right?"
But, bangs was not ready t > give any
information about ruddy, lie simply
winked and said nothing. The remark,
however, had touched him on the raw.
"I wish il w is my brother," lie mut
tered as he 1 urned a way. "When that
Irishman get.-, to Yale lie will make a
name for himself that will live a hun
dred years. And Lawrence will never
be ho;: rd of "
Tiii last, reflection put Hangs in a
very bad temper, and he went home and
lay awake two hours thinking of his
brother. *
lie was at his bachelor quarters early
next m< irninprepared for an important
interview with Paddy O'Toole. He
found that young man in a sweet
dream of peace.
"Come turn out!"" called I'angs, cheer
ily. "it's time for breakfast."
"Breakfast?" cried i utiuy, awake in
a moment. "Say, do 1 get some? Is
that si 1 night?"
"Of course it is. As soon as you've
had your bath—"
"Mi bath? An' me that was washed
only yesterday? Say, do 1 wash every
day? Am I a Chinese laundry?''
"You're a civilized Christum now,"
rejoined Hani's, "and the sooner you
begin to act like one the better. Per
haps 1 didn't make you understand yes
terday, inst what has happened to you.
The case stands this way. You've got
the making of a great ball player in
you. Now, I'm a Yale man."
"What's that? Deni fellies what
plays football, and slugs der heads
offn each other?"
"Well, that's part of it. Yale is a
college in New Haven, and tlioi if us
who have been there are bound to see
Yale win every time. You've got to go
to Yale and play on the nine. I don't
want to give you a big head, but it's a
fact that you handle a baseball better
than any other fellow I ever saw, and
I've seen many a good one. Now, rich
men give money to colleges. I'm w ill
ing to do that, but I want to be sure
that the money is spent in a way that
will do the college 1 ine good. There
fore I'm going to ud it myself. I'm
going to spend "ding you there.
It's a great ty for you, but
you'll lr 11 by hard study,
and ' fin right now."
■' sy complacently,

"the schools is all closed. I heard a
kid say so."
Bangs laughed.
"You won't go to school yet. I'll be
your teacher for the present. Heaven
knows 1 don't like the job, but I'll do it
for the sake of the college. Now get
up, and eat your breakfast, for you've
got a hard day's work before you."
Bangs went out into the parlor and
presently Paddy appeared, wearing the
suit of clothes which Bangs had pur
chased on the previous day, and carry
ing his shirt collar in his hand.
"Had luck to it!", exclaimed Paddy,
throwing it on the floor. "It cuts me
t'r< >at."
Bangs ordered him to put it on. Pad
dy deinured. 1 Ie said he was willing to
v> ear it <.11 Sundays, but he thought that
seven days a week of it was "crowdin'
der limit."
".No collar, no breakfast," said Bangs
at last, and that carried the point.
It is only fair to say that Paddy, prop
erly dressed, and with his mouth closed,
was a good-looking youth. His skin
was unusually white, despite his out-of
door life, and his face was thm to
match his figure which was like a lit
tle man on stilts. But his features
were strong and his eyes bright and
steady. Altogether he had a good
head for a student, if there had been
anything in it. Ilisgreatstrength lent
a certain grace to his movements,
thnigli one would have expected him
to be as awkwaul as a young calf.
It is impossible within the limits of
this narrative to describe the educa
tional process to which Paddy was sub
jected. Naturally he did not learn
much on the lirst day, but Harry Hangs
iiill. r i hose of us who have had the ad
vantages of early training do not real
ise what its total absence implies.
Bangs had never been a student. He
had studied just enough to get an idea
of the vast number of things which
one can know. He had a general no
tion that somebody knew them all. but
he had never considered the possibility
of the existence of a person who did
not know any of them.
We forget, sometimes, that infinity
is just as long one way as it is the
other. It is as hard to grasp the real
meaning of nothing as it is to under
stand everything.
That was what was the matter with
the education of Paddy O'Toole. It
was impossible to get back to the place
where it ought to begin. It is all very
well to talk of beginning a child's edu
cation with that of his grandfather,
but what ire you going to do if the old
gentleman is dead?
In the course of a week Bangs had
not found anything to teach Paddy,
because there was always something
which he ought to learn before that.
And so at random he started him 011
Hngli.sh grammar. Now, a merciful
.'rovidi'tice, which sends the mumps
and things of that kind to us at an age
when we are unable to comprehend
the horror of them, has wisely made
the same provision in regard to the ail
vent of grammar into our lives. There
are e.v < ;'lions, of course, and every
body must have an idea how very bad
an adult case of mumps would be. Im
agine grammar, then, at the age of
seventeen an age when most of us
have had it, and forgotten all about it.
Paddy O'Toole thought that he was
going to die of it. He contracted it
from a man named Brown. They say
that llrmvn in private life was not
worse than his neighbors. It is only
when we tackle his {fraiuraiir that we
perceive how nnich of the (Hd Satan
was in him. Paildy could read in a
general way, though he had no recol
lection of having learned. An account
of a baseball game in a newspaper was
moderately clear to him. Hut Hrown
was not nearly so lucid as a modern
sporting writer.
"Just read the first part of this till
you get an idea of what he's talking
about," said Hangs, laying the book
before his pupil, "and when I get back
you can tell me about it."
And l'addy honestly tried to do it.
He worked his shirt collar off in the
first ten minutes, and his coat and
waistcoat soon followed.
"I'll take a fall out o'dis gillie," he
said, apostrophizing Brown, "if it
breaks me back."
At the end of an hour the dryness of
the subject had imparted a thirst to
him which water couldn't quench. And
there was nothing else to be had.
Hangs was liberal in every other way.
but he would not hear of mixed ale or
any other deleterious beverages. He
had given his man .James strict orders
to deny Paddy all such things. Paddy
had not suffered from this absti-

nonce until lie encountered Tirown. Tie
was quickly convinced that lie would
never understand llrovvn, but he be
lieved that with the aid of a pint of
beer he might be able to endure him.
lie had some money in his pocket, but
he dared not go out for fear that James
would tell Hangs.
"I've got to rush der growler," he
said to himself. "I'll die if I don't."
In desperate emergencies such as
this there is always a means of salva
tion it' one only seeks it. Paddy sought
and found. There was a large ball of
cord in the room, and an ordinary,
small coffee pot which had once been
used when Hangs was sick in his rooms.
This had been thrown into a cupboard
where it had sustained serious injury,
lint it was still water tight. Paddy
put some money in it and lowered it
out of the window at the end of the
cord. By and by a boy came along.
Paddy stuck his head far out of the
window so that James could not hear,
and bawled his errand to the boy. The
experiment worked well, and Hrown's
introductory remarks seemed some
what more lneid afterward. Thereaft
er Paddy mixed P.rown and beer in
the proportion of a pint to a page, and
when Hang , returned the beer, at least,
had found it i way to Paddy's head.
lie was asleep, with ''rown fora pil
low, and the empty tin beside him.
