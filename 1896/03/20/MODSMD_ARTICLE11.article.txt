Stanford has learned by bitter
experience that a college is often
blamed for the acts of outsiders
who wear its colors. In view of
this we are glad to learn that
hoodlums who attracted so much
attention by their actions at yes
terday's baseball game were Santa
Clara town boys and do not attend
the college. Our friends from
Santa Clara should be careful, how
ever, as to whom they permit to
wear the red and white.
