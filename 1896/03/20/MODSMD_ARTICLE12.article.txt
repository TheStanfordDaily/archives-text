Complaint is made that some
members of the Junior Class are
not this year displaying the inter
est in the success of the Annual
which those in charge have a right
to look for. The semester is draw
ing rapidly to its close, and it is
high time that every member of the
Class of '97 who intends to pay the
necessary assessment should place
his mite in the hands of the treas
urer. From the present moment
forward funds will he urgently
needed. In a few days the Annual
will go to press. Those upon whom
the Junior Class placed the re
sponsibility for the success or fail
ure of the publication should not
have to meet discouragement and
unnecessary trouble. The class
owes to them all the support and
assistance it can give. We feel
sure that any delinquency hereto
fore existing has been due rather to
neglect and carelessness than to
positive lack of interest, and only a
word should be necessary to rouse
the forgetful ones to a proper sense
of their duty.
