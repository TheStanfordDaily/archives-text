Berkeley, Cal., March IS', 189(>.
If the full with us is a lime of
great excitement over one concern,
culminating on Thanksgiving day,
spring is certainly a time of just as
great collective excitement over
many, so that we are in a sort of
steeplechase from one week to the
next. After the Carnot debate and
the anxiety about question and
sides for the Intercollegiate, we
were plunged into "Student Labor,''
and have emerged from that (with
blistered hands) to encounter field
day, baseball, basket-ball, Stanford
debate, Eastern athletic tour, and
enough other things to make a
book. As for the labor on the
campus, a few did not work and
the rest had a good time. Hours
were such as a tarrier might have
laughed at, but the task was ful
filled and an epoch marked in our
university life. Some of us are in
clined to slap ourselves on the back
for it, but the most of us are not
given to saying much about it now
it is over, except it be to hope,
through our labor, fora righting of
opinion where opinion has gone
wrong concerning the college man.
We do rejoice that the newspapers
have not once misreported us in
this affair: indeed, they have been
almost too lavish.
The women of the university are
not going to be behind the men.
They propose to crown their broth
ers' toil with the beauty of plants
and grass. The faculty, too, was
well represented in the pick-and
shovel brigade.
Tonight, March 18, comes the fi
nal trial debate for the Intercolle
giate. Flaherty, "J6, is the only
member of last year's team to try.
The question is the intercollegiate
question. More interest is shown
here in debating than ever before.
Last Saturday, March 14, the
Freshmen beat the Dentals at base
ball, winning the interclass cup.
The same day the Sophomores beat
the Freshmen on the track and
field. Individual work of both
classes was good, but '9<S had more
men. In Lloyd, '99, is our most
likely successor to Koch as all
round athlete. He broke the Coast
record with the shot, and almost
did so in the pole-vault.
The men of the Senior Class en
joyed a trip to the Presidio a week
ago, to view the batteries and the
parade. Everything about the
new dynamite guns and the mor
tars was carefully explained by the
officers at the post.
THE BERKELEYAN.
