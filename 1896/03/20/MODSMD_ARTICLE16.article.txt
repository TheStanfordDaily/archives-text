# Baseball Averages.
## 
### 
Baseball averages are uncertain
guides for determining a player's
real worth to a team, but the fol
lowing figures may give some idea
of the batting ability of our players.
In all the games played on the
campus to date the Varsity play
ers rank as follows: Taylor, .400;
Wight, .893, Thompson, .886; Har
ris, .875; Sharp, .888; Stansbery,
.804; Jeffs, .285; Freeman, .250;
James, .285; Young, .217; Mc-
Laine, .211. The players of
the second team stand as follows:
Smith, .500; Ruddell, .411; Osgood,
.800; Campbell, .294; Strohn, 222;
Leppo, Mill, Austin, Whipple,
Kla liber, Cotton. Allowance
must be made for the fact that the
second nine bat against better
pitchers in practice games than the
Varsity, as a rule.
The present Varsity may be
strengthened from the second team
in one or two places, and with
needed improvement in team-work
and base-running will form a strong
team.
