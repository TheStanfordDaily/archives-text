# Track and Field.
## 
### 
Work is going on again on the
cinder track. Most of the men got
out of condition in the rest caused
by the rains and they are justcom
ing into form again.
It looks as though we would be
stronger than usual in the sprints,
formerly our weakest point. Bern
bard is in better form than ever be
fore, great things are expected of
Brunton, while Wootten showed by
his running in the Sophomore-
Freshman field-day that he is go
ing to prove a factor.
On the other hand no one but
Brown and Brunton and possibly
Burke has shown anything like
Varsity form in Ihe 440, 880, and
mile. We can not enter Brunton
in everything, and Brown may
have his hands full with both the
longer distances to run. We miss
Knowles and Copeland this year.
