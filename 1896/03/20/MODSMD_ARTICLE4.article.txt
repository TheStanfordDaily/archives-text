# Stanford, 5—Santa Clara, 0.
## 
### 
It will be many a day before j
another such game as Thursday's
will be played on the Stanford cam-!
pus. But for two unfortunate mis
takes of the team behind him, Mc-j
Laine would have shut out the;
Santa Clara nine without hit or
run. To show what this would |
mean, it may be said that the best!
of pitchers perform this feat once,
perhaps, in their terms on the dia
mond. And it was against no fif
teenth-rate team that this was done, I
but against one of the best amateur
nines on the Coast. Taylor did not 1
start quick enough for Kelly's hit
over short, or he could probably!
have cut it off. Wight and Harris;
allowed Morrisey's fly to drop be
tween them, which either could j
easily have taken. Five Santa
Clara men, all told, reached first
base, and but two reached second.
The batting of the game was of
such a character that the Santa
Clara in-field had much more work!
to do than their opponents, and]
they did it in a more brilliant fash-1
ion.
