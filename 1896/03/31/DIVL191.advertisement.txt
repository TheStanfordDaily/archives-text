BEFORE LONG
Ail who riik' thy bicycle will he wearing
the Deinu'l Linen-Mesh Underwear. j
Those who do now are enthusiastic in :
praising it.
People who exercise much, such as j
wheelmen, ball players and lovers of:
other kinds of athletic sport, ought to i
appreciate the invaluable advantages of I
our Linen-Mesh Underwear, which ab- j
sorbs the perspiration and dries quickly, J
hence feels warm and comfortable dur- J
ing exercise and after; which neither!
overheats the body while exercising, nor !
chills it when at rest, and which never j
clings to the body like a wet woolen or
cotton garment. These facts speak for
t liemsel ves.
Mr. Lewis Herreshoff of Defender
fame, has this to say: "1 think the I
I)eimel Linen-Mesh should be worn by j
all who ride the bicycle; you should lay
far more stress on that."
