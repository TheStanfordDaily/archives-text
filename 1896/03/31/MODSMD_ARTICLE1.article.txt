# Pan-Hellenic Banquet.
## 
### 
At Roble Monday evening the
Woman's Pan-Hellenic Associa
tion, organized in January, held its
first banquet. The table was in
the old Roman shape, of the letter
-. and beautifully decorated with
the flowers of the six sororities rep
resented —Jh'iir df fix, red and yel
low roses, carnations, pansies, and
lilies of the valley.
The young ladies were in even
ing gowns, and the scene was un
usually beautiful and impressive.
Miss Lucy Evelyn Wight, Kappa
Kappa (ianima, made a charming
and graceful toastmistress, effecting
the transition from subject to sub
ject with tact and cleverness.
The first toast, ''When Greek
meets (ireek," was responded toby
Miss Helen Williams, Pi Beta Phi.
She sketched with wit and clever
ness the peculiar relations of rival
sororities associated in Pan-llel
lenic pleasures.
Mrs. Waller Miller, (iatnma Phi,
gave the next toast, "The Alum
nae.'' She discussed the advantage
to the woman out of college, of her
fraternity ties, and spoke feelingly
and justly of the disadvantages
urged against fraternities, and of
the preponderance of benefit.
Miss Winifred Webb, Kappa Al
pha Theta, spoke on ' A woman of
the century," and extolled the no
bility and true womanliness of Mrs.
Stanford, dwelling on her qualities
of loving wife and mother as well
as her business ability and devo
tion to her University.
Miss Florence Whit tier, Delta
(iamma, gave a humorous talk on
<- The co-ed," meaning the boy stu
dent. She touched lightly on the
frailties of "our brothers," and
painted in vivid tints the various
types.
Miss Agnes Morley, Alpha Phi,
gave a sparkling toast on "The
goat,'" which she "had found a hard
subject to deal with." Her remarks
were brief, but witty and to the
point.
The last toast was "Auf Wieder
sehen," by Miss Fannie Mitchel.
The sadness of parting, the memory
of college joys, the surprising meet
ings of college youth in after years,
were feelingly treated.
Mrs. Smith led the patriotic
song, '' 11 ai 1. Stanford, Hail." and
the charming intermixture of girl-
Greeks ceased, to be renewed upon
many future occasions.
Souvenir toast cards with cardi
nal Stanford flags for covers, and
pen and ink sketches of all the
"frat" pins, will ever recall a
unique and happy evening, when
(ireek met (ireek.
