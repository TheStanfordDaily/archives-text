W'k learned with pleasure n<>t
unmixed with regret, of the ap
pointment of Professor Woodruff
to a chair of Law in Cornell. It is
unusual to give so young a man as
I'rofe&sor Woodruff such an im
portant position as he has accepted,
and this fact adds to the honor of
the appointment.
We can spare a professor now
and then for the presidency of a
college, hut it seems as though Cor
nell might have left us Professor
Woodruff, lie occupied a unique
position in the University, and it
will he long before any of us who
knew him forget his ready wit,
charming personality, and class
room ability. His Stanford friends
wish him every success in his new I
position.
