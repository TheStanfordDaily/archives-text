In the past students have some
times had cause to complain of the
great number of examinations
heaped upon them during the clos
ing week or ten days of the year'.
It is not always possible for the
members of the faculty to arrange
their tests so as to fall before the
end of the semester, but wherever
it can be done, the students are
sure to appreciate such considera
tion. In cases where one has to
write on half a dozen examinations
in the course of three or four days,
the burden is by no means light.
We feel sure that the professors in
fixing the dates tor the various
tests they intend to give, will con
sult, wherever possible, the con
venience of their students by
spreading the work through the
final week of the semester instead
of crowding it into a few days at
the close.
