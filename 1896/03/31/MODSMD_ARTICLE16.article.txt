Eight more weeks and the col
lege year, which for Stanford has
been so momentous in various
ways, will be a part of the past.
The brief remainder of the semester
must be a busy one for all of us.
Much is still to be done in the in
terval between now and Commence
ment week. In all the activities of
undergraduate life, there will be
from this on a great many tasks to
be disposed of.
The remainder of the semester
will certainly not witness any
lightening of the burdens of study;

and in addition to the tasks con
nected with the regular work of the
University there will he a great
deal to attend to in regard to purely
student interests —athletic, mu
sical, and otherwise. The month
of April is always the busiest from
an athletic standpoint, in the whole
college year. What with field-days,
baseball games, and tennis matches,
those whose interests lie in the di
rection of sport, will find enough to
keep their minds and tongues busy.
The production of Said Pasha, the
exercises of Junior Day, the work
of issuing the Quad and Senior
Claspbook, the arranging of details!
in connection with the Commence-j
ment exercises —a 11 these and
many other similar tasks will keep
those who take an interest in gen-j
eral student affairs as busy as bees j
for the remaining weeks of the se-j
m ester.
