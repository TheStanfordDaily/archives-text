ft was evident that Paddy 0"T<ole,
who hud been accustomed to an active
life. would not thrive without. exercise.
Therefore llanos was in the habit \<i
playing ball with him on a vacant lot
in the Hack I Jay district for two hour.,
every day in the week.
Tin result of this practice more than
eon firmed Hangs* original opinion.
Paddy as a pitcher was certainly a
wonder. Ilow he had learned the art
was a mystery to Hangs and >10 less
to Prddy himself. He said that he had

a mystery. Ilow did Shakespeare

faddy had the .speed of a cannon
ball, and curves and shoots that vvoifld
have made a boomerang thrower aban
don his weapon in disgust.
Ii was near the close of the fourth

hi- protege v.-ere taking their custom

Had h'• remarkable eurves. He stood
with :«i • bark tn J be street, and he was
a very busy man. To face I'addy in
such a pastime required about all the

attrition that iniv one man could give.

It was Florence who was calling,
llanos jumped over the low fence and

the girl. "von can understand how de-
I iirhted I am to sec you—"
Mie paused as if trying 1 to select an
appropriate phrase..
"Me. I hope." .said Uangs, laughing.
"Don't hesitate to say it. lam too old
to miml liattery. And lam very glad
to see you. i did not know you were
in boston."
"We are here fora few days." said
Mrs. Lome. "We came up from New
port where wc are spending the sum

We are staying at the Ashton s, and
hope to see you."
"Yes. indeed," said Florence. "I have
a gtval deal to say to you. You know
I mcl your brother in Newport.''
"Yes: Lawrence wrote me about it
immediately."
"Indeed." said Florence,and she gave

bangs turned ant! saw Paddy staring
open-mouthed at the carriage. In half
a minute he began to advance towards
j it.
"11 rent Cassar!" muttered Hangs. "I
can't let him get within speaking dis
j tance."
Hut Paddy steadily advanced. Hangs
had the ball in his hand, and in des
| peration he threw it with tremendous
l.force and high over Paddy's head.
"He'll have to chase it to the other
end of the lot." thought Hangs, as he
turned toward the carriage.
"Splendid, splendid!" cried Florence,
clapping her hands.
Hangs wheeled around. Paddy had
soar d into the air like a bird, and had
captured the ball with one hand.
1 "That'sall niy doing." said Florence,
proudly. "I talked to him."
"Von talked to him?" repeated Har
ry. in amazement.
"Yes. 1 gave it to him good, I tell
you. I told him that he was just aim
ply throwing himself away and break
ing a1! your hearts. 1 said that lie ought
to do something for the university. Of
course 1 oughtn't to have done it, but 1
told you that 1 was going to. He didn't
like ii much, 112 thought that he wa:i
seriously offended. Hut it seems that
it did him good."
Hangs gasped. He wondered what
could be the matter with his head, lie
con!dn l make the least sense of what
the girl was saying.
"We had quite a quarrel," the girl
continued, "lie said that so far as he
had been able to learn the best ball
player in the country was an ignorant
Iri .hman: and 1 said: 'He can't be so
v *v ignorant because he can teach the
let.rued Lawrence Hangs something,
lie can teach him how to play ball.'"
"Whom are you talking about? M3'
brother."'
"Why, of course. There; he's coming
at last.."
Hangs heard the sound of Paddy's
feet on the sidewalk as he came down
from his leap over the fence. Another
second and"the wonder" was beside
him.
"Take off your hat, you monkey,"
whispered Hangs, in Paddy's ear, and
Paddy pulled it olf. as if it was nailed
to a wall and he was tearing it down.
"So you didn't remember me," said
Florence, archly, "but it seems that
you remembered what I said to you."
"Remember you!" cried Paddy, in his
richest brogue. "An 1 who could l'orgit
the loikes av ycz?"
"Ifood, splendid!" cried Florence,
laughing heartily. "I see you've taken
more than one lesson from the Irish
man you spoke of. Come, mother, we
mustn't interrupt the good work."
She nodded cheerily to I tangs and
Paddy. The carriage moved away.
Hangs rubbed his head with the left
hand catcher's glove, which is the size
of a ham; but it did not produce fric
-1 ion enough to stimulate his mind in
: he proper degree.
"Paddy," he said, "let's go home. 1
want to think this thing over quietly."
"What's der matter?" asked Paddy,
sympathetically. "Did she t'row yer
j down?"
Hangs said never a word. He led
the way to the rooms. As they en
tered a young man rose from a chair
ind advanced toward them. He was
. cry tall, and his legs were inordinate
ly long.
"P.rotlier llarrv." said he. extending

•'Lawrence! Well, upon my word,

"Your hrudder?" said I'addy. ''Well,

Lawrence was staring hard at I'addy,
and the elder Langs gaped upon them
as thev stood facititr each other.
