Although Oxford proposes to ad
mit women students to the degree
of bachelor of arts, it does so only
on condition that they pass a bet
ter examination than the men.
This seems unjust, but it is not un
exampled. They must take honors
in at least one course of study or
they will not get a degree, although
one is conferred on men who sim
ply "pass" without taking honors.
But the privilege of having a de
gree at all, small though the favor
is, is thankfully received by the
women students.
