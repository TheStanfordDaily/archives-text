# The 						Collecting Expedition.

### 
Dr. Gilbert and his assistants,
; Pierson,'97, MacGregor, '97, and
; Starks, special, arrived at the Uni
| versity March 19, from their expe
| dition to Panama. Over 275 dif
ferent kinds of fishes were collected
during their stay in Panama.
' Forty were entirely new species
never before discovered, and about
J seventy-five were species which so
far as is known were never before
I taken from the Bay of Panama.
In addition they secured a few
| mammals and some rare species of
birds. Complete sets will be kept
in the Zoological museum of the
University and duplicates will he
| sent to museums in London, Vienna,
{and the National Museum at Wash
ington. The fish have not been
I opened yet as the alcohol ordered
! has not yet arrived.
This is Dr. Gilbert's third trip to
Panama. In 1880 lie was making
a census of the fishes of the Pacific
I Coast and returned home by way
iof Panama. In 18S1 he made an
! expedition there under the auspi
ces of the Smithsonian Institute.
He was also connected with the
| University of Indiana. 1.55 va
rieties of fish were collected, but
were destroyed with all the data by
lire at the Indiana University.
During the thirteen years interval
none of the species were rediscov
ered, and it was determined to
j make the last expedition. This
i was possible only through the
generosity of .Mr. Timothy Hopkins.
| The present trip cost $1000. Dr.
| Gilbert is full of interesting remin
iscences of his trip and gave a des
cription of the method of fishing.
I "We took a long about ten gallons
!of the juice of the I lava tree, a
i white milky fluid, a poison which
will kill the fish if poured into the
i water in large quantities. We
| would pour some of this fluid into
the tide pools, which would stir up
i the fishes in the depths, so that
! they would come to the surface,
| where we would catch them with
dip nets. Many valuable speei-
I mens were secured in this way.
We obtained permission from the
government to use dynamite, and
I also killed the fish that vvav. We
J used an electrical hand dynamo to
| transmit sparks to an electric cap
| imbeded in the dynamite and thus
I discharged it at the proper time,
j For skeleton collections the dyna
mite method is useless, for it breaks
the fishes' bones, although no ex
| ternal wound is given. We made
a good collection of skeletons.
"We did not cross to the Atlantic
side owing to the sickness of our
party, however, I reached the sum
mit of the ridge where the canal
makes a big cut. A new company
|is now working on the canal and
employs about 2000 men who re
ceive about o0 cents a day in U. S.
money.
"The results of the trip were
most satisfactory. Only 185 va
rieties were secured in my second
expedition while 275 were secured
in this last. We rediscovered all
; the new species and many more be
sides. We discovered new species
up to the day we left."
