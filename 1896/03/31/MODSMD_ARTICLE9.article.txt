### 
The performance of "Said Pasha,"
for which all the leading musical
J talent of Stanford has been dili
gently practicing, will takeplace in
Eneina gymnasium, April 10 and
11. A complete and well appointed
■ theatrical stage with cut traps is
| being built in sections so that it
■ may be easily set up and taken
! apart and will also serve for the
Junior Farce and University
■theatricals. The electrical effects
will be a novel feature. The cos
tumes are new, the management
having secured them at an expense
of $200. The scenery used by the
Tivoli Opera Company in its recent
production of ''Said Pasha" lias
j been obtained and will be the most
j artistic ever seen at Stanford. In
stage-sittings it will excel any pro
j duction previously given at Stan
ford.
