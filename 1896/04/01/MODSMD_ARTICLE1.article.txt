# "JUDAS ISCARIOT, SON OF PERDITION.”
## Sermon by Francis E. Hinckley. 
### 
Eleven of the diciples were ( Jali-,
leans, most of them fishers by oc
cupation, sturdy, honest in convic
tions, and slow in ideas. I he
other disciple was of Judea, a
native of Keriotth, which was an up
land village within the suburban
territory of Jerusalem. Judas was
by instinct a trader. City news
awoke his thought; the quick trans
actions of city business quickened
his imagination and aroused his
enthusiasm; the companies of com
peting merchants in the strife of
sale brought his energies to action,
gave him knowledge of intricate
commercial relations, suavity, per
severance, forcefulness. lie was a
man of ideas, far reaching,
thoroughly - searching, powerful
ideas-—ideas predominating in the
records of the temple —essentially
Jewish ideas. Speaking little,
thinking much, he pondered over
history and the future of his peo
ple; he was an intensely devoted
patriot, hating the Roman most
bitterly, brooding over the dark
fortunes of Israel, anxiously ex
pecting the Messiah to come who
should again give rule to the throne
of David in Mount /ion. In such
a man Jesus saw the possibility of
a noble character. Therefore he
made Judas one of the twelve.
Each of these twelve was to become
an apostle — all save one. He,
against opportunity, was to become
an apostle. The man of strong
convictions was to be in danger of
nothing so much as his own
strength. "Judas," said Lavater,
"acted like Satan, but a Satan who
had it in him to be an apostle."
The austere man of Kerioth
knew not the ways of the men of
(Talilee. Although called to be
with them, to journey from place
to place in common with them, he
was yet a stranger and alone. Pe
culiarly strong and self-reliant as
he was, he might not share with
others his own and their problems,
tasks, successes, and comforts. Of
human sympathy and counsel he
had none to give and none to re
quire. I would not say that Judas
was selfish; he was too noble for
that. He grew more silent, sombre,
and separated. Consequently there
arose in his mind dissatisfactions,
distrusts, and suspicions.
He cherished Jewish notions of
the Messiah to come, and when the
Master spoke of his suffering and
death at the hands of men, Judas
was offended. He would not aban
don the idea of a universal theoc
racy in which God should be king,
and the people of Israel chosen to
rule with him. The other disciples
gradually forsook their own fond
hopes for an earthly empire, but
Judas never did.
What were the real motives of
Judas in his dark sin? Certainly
the love of money was not a mo
tive; avarice can not explain the
act. Nor can the motive of mis
taken enthusiasm stand. The mo
tive of Judas was revenge. The ca
reer of Jesus to his sin-blinded eyes
was more and more a dissapoint
ment. His ambitions were con
fronted by dismal humiliations of
Him whom he had expected to be
come King of the Jews. Reproof

came from the lips of one to whom
he had pledged his strong loyalty.
Circumstances seemed to f;iil to
coerce the Savior into rise of his
miraculous power. Judas had used
vigor to try to persuade Jesus to
overcome his enemies hy force, and
now Judas would use violence to
show his own disdain of the rebukes
of Christ. He had offended Christ
and this liberty of offense begat vir
ulent hatred. For the very heat of
anger he would go over to the party
of the priests and cast them against
Jesus to wound him unto death
with the revenge of Judas.
Temptations similar to that of
Judas appeal to ourselves. If we
are aggressive, if we love power, we
have traits of the character of Ju
lias. May 1 compel anyone to do
right or to become good? May I
force the growth of character?
May I seek to control by sheer
strength my friend or myself?
Then I am liable to the temptations
of Judas!
