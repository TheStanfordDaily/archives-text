' 'There ccrtunily is u remarkable re
semblance between us,'" s-iaid Lawrenee,
"and if 112 am not mistaken that was
what you intended to imply.'"
"Say, if you'd get your hair cut," re
sjjomled Paddy, "i wouldn't be dead
Mire o" meself any of the time. I'd be
? inkin' it might be you."
llarr' P.angs sank into a chair, and
pressed his hands to his head, lie did
more Thinking in tin* next two minutes
than he had done in any month of his
life.
"What is it, Harry?"asked Lawrence.

"Yon sot'jTi lo l)i' struggling \iith some
perplexing problem. Can 1 help you'.'
\Viml is it?"
"I was thinking." said llanos, "what
i: man for Yale you two would make if
you e:uil.1 he rolled into one. I5y Jove."
and lie shipped his thigh, "I believe
you can be!"
"What do you mean?"
"Can you play baseball?"
Lawrence stared hard.
"I never tried." he said. "It seems
to me that the prominence now be in}/*
given to athletic sports is deleterious
to the—"
"Can you play football?"
"No, indeed."
"Can you pull an oar?"
"No.''
"Are you good for any single tiling
on earth? Will you be of the least use
to Yale? Will anybody except the pro
fessors know that you are there or re
member you ten minutes after you
leave?"'
"This is unkind." said Lawrence.
"We have not. seen each other in years,
and now you load me with reproach
es.'*
"You mustn't take it that way, Lar
ry." said his brother kindly. "I am
only paving the way. 1 am going to
show you how von can do something
for the university."
"Never in the line of sports, I'm
afraid."
"Yes, you can. See here. Thisyoung
man is I'atrick O'TooIe. lie is going
to be the finest ball player that this
country ever saw. I have offered to
send him to Yale. Hut his education
has been totally neglected. It would
take seventeen yea.rs to lit him for a
primary school. Hut his resemblance
to you solves the whole problem. You
can be the student; he the athlete. I
tell you that the dual personality could
be carried on for four years -yes, sir,
tor four hundred years, and no mortal
human being over suspect it. Lawrence,

will you «lo this? Will you maue tins
sacrifice for the good of the univer
sity?"
"I would do anything 1 for Vale." re
plied Lawrence, "and certainly I would
do anything to please you and father.
Hut is this honest? 1 am imperfectly
acquainted with the rules of sport. Is
such a thing permitted?"
'•Say, what is ihis yer givin' us?" in
qnire.d i'.iddy. "Do youse mean that
I'm to be a ringer for your brother?"
"That's it. exactly."
"Hut is it honest?" repeated Law
rence.
"Honest?"said Paddy, "i don't know
much about that, but it's more common
than j:i;. r .• on the I'onrf o' .Inly. Why.
there ain't a nmaclii«>r scrapping tour
nament in the country that don't have
half a dozen ringers in it."
"1 aiii g/ad to know that it is permit
ted by the, rules." said Lawrence, "but
1 dislike the dee pi ion. 1 supposi the
riuger. as Mr. O'Toole calls him. i ju.,l
be introduced secretly into the game,
and can be disbarred if <leteete.il. The
truth is only justifiable when success
ful, like so many others in this world.
Am ! right?"
"Lead right," said Paddy, who did
not understand a word.
"But would it not be discovered?"
"There's no danger at all." said
Harry. "Miss Lome just mistook
Patsy for you and slur was not un
deceived even when he spike to her."
"If I could fully reconcile it with my
conscience." Lawrence began.
"Reconcile it with your duty," ex
claimed Harry; "your duty to the uni
versity and to your father. lie will
never know that Paddy is not you, and
he v. ill be proud of you. And oh," he
added, raising his hand aloft like an
inspired prophet., "I tell you that with
Paddy in the box. Harvard simply
won't be in it. Think of that, Larry;
think of that!"
