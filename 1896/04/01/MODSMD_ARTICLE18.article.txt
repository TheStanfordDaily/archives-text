With swing and verve and jollity
The college students sing;
The days gone by, the incidents,
To recollection bring.
Then on the campus green we stood
And joined in the refrain;
Now when we hear t he st udents sing
We do it o'er again.
We feel the blood of youth once more
Chase wildly through our veins
The world seems brighter than it did
I n list'ning to t lie st rains.
We see our college mates about,
As close they gather 'round;
And loud the rising chorus swells
I pon the college ground.
There's Hobby .lenks, who pulled the
st roke,
A judge of racing boats,
A tenor high, and Sammy Smith
Who reached the lower notes.
And I'odunk French, a baritone,
Whom no one could excel,
And Skinny Tubbs. who couldn't
si ng —
Great gods how he could yell.
Old Hank Ma gee, a lusty chap
Willi wonderful biceps,
Led on with cane and swinging arms
From off the chapel steps.
Sly Jim Pennell, the college wit.
When loud his voice did rise
All other silence, then maintained,
To hear him improvise.
Pennell was not much upon tone-
His voice was out of reach
If von could hear him improvise
You'd say he was a peach.
And when a pretty girl passed by
Wedroppcd the sharps and Hats,
And lined right up in proper shape,
And all then doffed their bats.
And when a prof, came sailing by
Our song went with a go;
Then Johnny Morgan was the t heme
Way down the lands below.
There's something in these college
songs
That lil Is us a 11 wit h glee,
Solidities the college boys
In great fraternity.
There was no guile nor subterfuge
In those old college days;
And common honesty prevailed,
And not because ii pays.
Sing on, O college students, sing;
llring back to memory dear
The days we sang together,
In friendship and good cheer.
