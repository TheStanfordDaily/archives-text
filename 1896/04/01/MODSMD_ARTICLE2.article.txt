Word reached here this after
noon that the Hon. Chauncey M.
Depew of New York had accepted
an invitation to lecture to the Stan
ford students tomorrow. The lec
ture will be given in the chapel at
2:15 p.m.
This brilliant gentleman needs
no introduction. He is visiting the
Coast on pleasure bent, and thus
far on his trip has refrained from
addressing any audiences whatso
ever. His exception in the case of
this University is indeed a compli
ment.
