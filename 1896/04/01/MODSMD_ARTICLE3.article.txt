# Basket-Ball.
## 
### 
The event which takes place next
Saturday afternoon at 8 o'clock in
Armory Hall, Page street, San
Francisco, is decidedly unique, it
being the first intercollegiate game
of basket-ball ever played. It is
earnestly hoped that as many as
possible of the Stanford women
will be present at the game. There
will he a large representation' from
Rerkeley and our team will feel
the lack of hearty support if every
one does not make an earnest effort
to go.
Admission fifty cents. Tickets
on sale at Roble gymnasium or
room 88 Roble Ilall.
