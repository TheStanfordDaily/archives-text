Berkeley, March HO, 1896.
Another Charter Day, Monday!
March 20, has come and gone,
making the twenty-eighth year of
the life of the university. The
usual exercises were held in the
gymnasium, notable among which
was the presentation to the univer
sity of a, portrait of the Rev. Horatio
Stebbins, one of the early sponsors
of the U. C. and lately a regent.
One of the best speeches of the day
was by Prof. St ill man of Stanford,
who is among our early alumni.
The "eastern trip" is of course
uppermost in our minds athletic
wise just now. The only thing in
doubt is finances —and some have
an idea that the money question is
not so easily brushed aside. There
is nothing like being sanguine,
though, when we have a chance to
meet each one of the Rig Four be
sides any number of small fry, and
when Rob Edgren has thrown (he
hammer 150 feet in practice, and
when Thomas of the Dental College
ran the hundred in 11 seconds the
first time he had on spikes, it does
seem as if funds should be found
somewhere. The Examiner is
backing a benefit field-day; beside
which there are a number of
schemes on foot for raising money.
Mr. Syle, of the English depart
ment, for instance, is working up a
presentation of Congreve's "Love for
Love," adapted, and proposes to
devote half the proceeds to the
Athletic Association. The other
half goes to the English depart
ment library. This undertaking of
Mr. Syle's is no small one, and he
ought to see good houses on April
11 and lo as a reward. The
cast is made of the college students.
Rut to return —there is t<» be a
mass-meeting of the Associated
Students this afternoon at which
the "eastern trip" will be launched,
and at which also the first public
distribution will be made of the big
"C"to those athletes who have won it.
Commencement speakers have
been chosen, Hirst, DeLaguna, Miss
Eleanor Rennet, Flaherty, VVyckoff.
They are thoroughly representative
of the senior class, and have all
along been regarded as its leaders
in college work. The lit. Rev.
Bishop Nichols is to preach the
baccalaureate sermon. Class day
will be unique in many particulars
but yet along the traditional lines
in general.
Baseball is progressing, but finds
it hard to crawl out of the lethargy
of past years. Victories and defeats
have been about even so far. Third
base is hard to fill; and the box,
also, is rather shaky. Kaarsburg
is counted on fora good deal next
year as pitcher, though Morden, of
the Dental, will probably pitch this
year, with Wheeler catcher and 0.
Elston on second. The final make
up is still rather indefinite.
The Reukklkyan.
