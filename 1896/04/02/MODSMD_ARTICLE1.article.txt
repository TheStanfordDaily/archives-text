# THE 						SOUTHERN TRIP.
## The 						Most Successful Trip Yet Made by Stanford Organizations. 
### 
The (ilee and Mandolin Clubs
returned to the I'diversity Tuesday
evening after the most successful
tour, all things considered, that
has been made by any Stanford or
ganization. Financially the trip
was not a brilliant success, but it
must be remembered that the suc
cess of such trips can not be judged
absolutely from a financial stand
point. From all other standpoints
musical, social, aesthetic —and
from the actual good done the Uni
versity by bringing it before the
public in an attractive way, it
would be hard to conceive of a
more successful trip. Hosts of
friends were gained for Stanford,
and our musical organizations re
ceived the highest praise, both for
their work as musicians and for
their conduct on the trip.
The clubs were composed of the
following men:
G I.KE CLUB.
First tenor: Chester Magee, W. A.
Sutherland, Edward C. Sewall.
Second tenor: ("has. (i. Decker,
(i. W. Mush, W. ('. McNeil, F. A.
Sell neider.

Phil F. Abbott, W. T. Voung, Tarn
McGrew, ('has. I. 1 )illon.
Second bass: (luy Coehr.an, A. (».
Kaufman, C Van H. King, W. .).
Sch lacks.
MANDOLIN CLl'B.
First Mandolin: W. Kittle Wells,
Edward C. Sewall, Thos. K. Code.
First guitar: (ieo. 11. Wilson,
Win. L. McCuire.
Second mandolin: A. (». Kauf
man, E. 1. Bartholomew.
Second guitar: 11. 11. Welch,
L. E. MeChesney.
In addition to these, L. J. Hins
dill and .J. A. Quelle accompanied
the clubs, the former representing
Ihe student body.
The first concert was given in
San Francisco Thursday, March 19,
and oneeach in Oakland and Fresno
on the two following nights. Had
the concerts in these places been
well advertised the trip would have
been a financial success, for during
the time that the clubs were in
Los Angeles and vicinity expenses
were paid. The San Francisco con
cert, owing to lack of time, had not
been sufficiently advertised, and
there was only a fair sized audience
present. However, it was one of
the most enthusiastic that the clubs
played before.
Sunday the 22d the clubs ar
rived in Los Angeles and appeared
in Pasadena Monday evening.
The concert was well attended, and
the student body manager had the
satisfaction of carrying away
thirty or forty dollars above ex
penses.
Tuesday was a busy day. Dur
ing part of the morning the clubs
were driven about Los Angeles in a
tally-ho. Later they gave a con
cert in the high school, which
gained for us many friends. In the
afternoon a tea was given the clubs
by the society young ladies of Los
Angeles. In the evening the con
cert was given in the Los Angeles
Theatre. After the concert a re
ception took place at the residence
of one of the patronesses.

Wednesday evening the clubs ap
peared in Santa Ana before a most
ap]>reeiative audience. Something
over expenses was made, and the
clubs did exceptionally well from a '
musical (standpoint.
Thursday and Friday concerts'
were given in Kedlands and lliver- j
side respectively. These two J
places were points of exceptional
interest, especially Kedlands, where I
the clubs were driven about the
country in four-in-hands. The fa
mous Smiley Heights and other
points of interest were visited. All
of Friday afternoon was spent in
riding about Riverside. The clubs
were taken to a large orange grove
and told to help themselves, llavoc
reigned supreme for about half an
luiu r.
Saturday evening a return con
cert was given in Los Angeles in
the normal school. The audience
was probably the largest that
greeted the clubs during the entire
tour. Sunday evening the
clubs left for Fresno, where
a concert was given Monday
night. The audience was very
small, but owing to the generosity
of Mr. Sherwood, who had charge
of the arrangements, the clubs were
enabled to reach San Francisco by
train. To the Stanford boys,
Fresno and frost are synonymous.
In all the towns where the clubs
appeared the most flattering not
ices were received, and when the
student body takes into consider
ation the great good that the trip
did the clubs and the number of
friends won over to Stanford, no
one can regret that the trip has
been taken, even though it has not
been the financial success that was
anticipated.
