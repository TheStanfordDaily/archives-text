It seems almost impossible to get.
out enough basKet-ball players to
I form two full teams. Day after
(lay tbe first team has been crippled
by the absence of some of the best
| players, who are obliged t<>
strengthen the second team. Un
less more interest is taken Berk
eley will surely win next Saturday,
as the blue and gold players are
! practicing fathfully.
In the game Tuesday with Cas
tilleja only eight players appeared
on each side. As it was those who
were out played well. Miss Clark,
a new player, proved herself a hard
player and a sure thrower. It is
late to make a change, but never
theless Miss Clark is likely to line
up with the Varsity for the Berk
eley game.
