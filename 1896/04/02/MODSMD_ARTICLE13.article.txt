Since the University was first
opened ;i constant line of com
plaint has been raised concerning
the library service and the inability
<>l students to get books at the desk.
If bad service needs condemnation
good service needs recognition, and
we could hardly ask for more at
tentive, painstaking, intelligent
service than we are at present re
ceiving from the young men in
charge of the delivery desk. The
small library and the large reading
public makes the position of a li
brary attendant a very difficult
one, and if our recognition of this
fact keeps pace with the present ef
forts of the attendants to assist us
we shall have little more to ask.
