Oi'u I'niversity has had a very
high compliment paid to it I>v Mr.
I )epew's consent, to lecture before
the associated students this after
noon. Mr. Depew lias been en
gaged in a tour of the l'acilicCoast,
and particularly California, for
some time, and this is the first op
portunity that any considerable
number have had of hearing him
speak. Although his remarks this
afternoon were of an informal or
der, yet they were greatly appre
ciated, and we feel especially for
tunate 1 in having been able to hear
him at all. There are many noted
men and women who come to this
Coast every year, and Stanford
I'Diversity has been extremely for
tunate thus far in having been able
to induce so many of them to ap
pear before the student body. In
this respect, and in view of our
happy location, we are probably

more highly favored by the oppor
tunity of listening to so many fa
mous speakers than any oilier
university in the country.
