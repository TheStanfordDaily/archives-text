The arguments In which Lawrence
Hongs was induced to yield to his
brother's wishes are not es-ent ial to
this narrative. It is enough that the
reader should know that the famous
youug man was in reality one-tenth
himself *and nine-tenths Paddy O'Tool.
Neither is it important to explain here
Hie ninehinery by which the trick was
played. it, was very simple. Harry
Han;.'.-* rented a house i.i .\ew Haven,
and Lawrence and I'addv lived there
with him. There was no other occu
pant except an old woman who acted
as housekeeper. Lawrence was visible
during the earlier hours of the day. At
the close of the recitations he went
home, and ceased to exist, Paddy took
his place. One of them was always in
the house, hidden from mortal view,
while the other played the pari <.112
student or athlete in the college world.
These details may be passed over
with mere mention, but there is one
point which needs a serious considera
tion. It may be that to the render
tliis scheme of dual personality will
appear objectionable on the ground
taken by Lawrence lianas at first,
namely, that it is not honest, if such
is his view, lie must remember Unit
t his is an isolated case. II i.. absolutely
i ::eep. i .i.and has no bearing upon
the <|ne si ion of the purity ol college
athletic.,. There is. in reality, no ..rich
question at all. If there i.s anything'
in men's later dealings with one an
other whicli is so honest, pure and
manly as college sport, it has eh verly
eluded tlie writer' observation. li
there is any tendency to take an un
fair aovaiuage, ii docs not come from
the b. s ili ;:i elves, but from men
who. sii.ee leaving college. have ar
rived at "business principles" by a
pi'oee -s wiiiehis vcr\ properly called
"eonbrdown." And even business
principles and the recognit i >11 of the
fact i hat a victorious team of athletes
is a good advt rtisenient. haVcbeen mic
<es i;;|i withstood thus far by the
native honesty of American youth.
The case of Lawrence llanos is an in
st aih eii' mi dirci ted enthnsi.ism which
will sometimes work mischief in the
best ft•: uhilv M societies, li is valuable
only a -an illustration of the relative
popularity of Ihe student and the ath
lete. .\ recognition of this fact dawned
upon La wrence very early in the game,
lie re:olvcd to make his name so il
lustrious by scholastic attainments
that the work of l'addy O Toole would
pale in comparison.

Langs had decided not to allo,w Poddy
t i In a candidate for the football team,
l'adti; public appearances during the
first three months were limited to a
few vi .it to the gymnasium. Harry
accompanied him on such occasions un
til lie became familiar with the build
ing. The deception was perfect. It
never occurred to anybody to doubt
the identity of the athlete and the stu
dent .
Meanwhile Lawrence burned the
midnight oil as he had never done be
fore. lie had sworn to make his name
known, and he succeeded. In a month
it was the talk of the college that the
brot her of the famous Harry Langs was
n long haired grind.
Tii". i- a term of reproach, and yet it
<■«: fi ies no bitterness. There is no
other pli.ee on earth where the individ- i

u;;l rights of man are so perfectly rec
ognized as they are in a lirst-rale Ameri
can colle - e. One may do as lie likes
there. And yet it is a fact that a
young man who spends fourteen hours
a day in h:.rd study has not much time
for making friends. bellows who
called up in him at first found him al
way: !:•■<>• deep in <ireek or Latin, and
they ceased to come because they dis
liked to disturb him.
During thi* time l'addy was being
subjected to an educational discipline

which was equally severe, though the
curriculum was limited, lie was being
taught to say a few words in a voice
which would not suggest the South
Cove of Iiostou to anybody who had
ever vi ited that locality. The natural
tone of his voice was, happily, quite
similar to Lawrence's, but his vocabu
lary was entirely different, lie did
not ay much, but when he did 1 unch a
remark it whi/./.ed through the air like
one of his masterly "in .shoots," and
left a sulphurous trail behind it. Not
that Paddy was a bad boy; no, indeed:
he was lull of amiable qualities which
had never been developed. lie ad
hered to his own standard of morality
with admirable fidelity, and it was cer
tainly not his fault that the standard
was no better, lie considered himself
bound in honor to please Harry Wangs
in everything, and it was he who first
sol veil the difficulty presented by his
peculiarities of conversation which
suited so ill with the character of Law
