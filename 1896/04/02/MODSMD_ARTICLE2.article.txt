# Senior Class-Book Photographs.
## 
### 
There are a few members of the
faculty and senior class who have
not as yet handed in their photo
graphs for the Senior Class-book.
Thors' will be open on Friday and
Saturday. All those who have no
photographs, or have not had a
sitting, must go there on one of
those days. It is urgently desired
that each member of the faculty
and senior class be represented in
the book. This is positively ths*
last chance that faculty members
and seniors will have to get their
photographs in on time, and all are
requested to give the matter im
mediate attention.
