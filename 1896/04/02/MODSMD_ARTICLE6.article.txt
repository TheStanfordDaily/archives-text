Wednesday's practice game of j
baseball was a lie, the score stand
ing 8 to 8 at the close of five in
nings. The game was interfered
with by the usual lack of players,but
two of the Varsity are laid off with j
slight sprains and this may account ;
somewhat for this shortage. Whip- j
pie pitched three innings for the!
second nine and held the Varsity!
down to three hits and two runs. |
Kuddell then went in and was
batted more freely.
The batting order of the Varsity
is as follows: Wight, Taylor,
Thompson, Harris, Sharp, Young,
Jeffs, Stansbery, James, Freeman,
and McLaine. Smith, Kuddell,
Osgood, Campbell, and Strohn
lead t lie second nine. Taylor,
Stansbery, James, and Freeman
have fallen off greatly in stick work
for the last few games. Thompson
has had too many strike-outs to his
credit of late. Young met the ball
squarely for the first time this sea
son, but his hits do not goon a line
and ran not always be expected to
go over the fielders heads.
in fielding, Harris was doing
brilliant work at second base before
his lay-off. Taylor at short plays
hard and conscientiously,and hiser
rors are mainly due to his inaccu
rate throwing. At third, Sharp
has been playing poorly for some
time. He does not run up well on
ground balls, and does not throw
hard to tirst.
The work of the battery is good.
Jeffs might make his throwing to
bases a little more accurate. In
the outfield, Thompson is weak on
ground balls; Wight is a little slow
in starting; Stansbery does not al
ways judge correctly; Freeman —
indeed the whole outfield has the
same fault —thinks he has done
enough when he has caught the
ball; and James is slow both on fly
and ground hits.
Notwithstanding these faults,
which may be corrected, the team
is capable of playing a good game,
and should try to make a good
showing when they bat against
Campbell, with his ''Stanford
Stars,'' on Saturday.
