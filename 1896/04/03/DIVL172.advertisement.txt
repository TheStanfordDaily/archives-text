BEFORE LONG-
All who ride tlie bicycle will he wearing
the Deimel Linen-Mesh Underwear.
Those who do now are enthusiastic in
praising it.
People who exercise much, such as
wheelmen, hall players and lovers of
other kinds of athletic sport, ought to
appreciate the invaluable advantages of
our I/men-Mesh Underwear, which ab
sorbs the perspiration and dries quickly,
hence feels warm and comfortable dur
ing exercise and after; which neither
overheats the body while exercising, nor
chills it when at rest, and whitih never
clings to the body like a wet woolen or
cotton garment. These facts speak for
themselves.
Mr. Lewis Herreshol't of Defender
fame, has this to say: "I think the
Deimel Linen-Mesh should be worn b\
all who ride the bicycle; you should lay
far more stress on that."
