# HON. CHAUNCEY M. DEPEW.
## Short Lecture to the Studen Yesterday. 
### 
When Dr. Jordan introduced Mr.
Depew yesterday ihe gymnasium
was filled to its limit, and every
point of vantage on the rafters was
occupied by the more daring mem
bers of the audience. The brilliant
speaker was greeted with applause
: nd at, the conclusion of his brief
discourse three rousing Stanford
yells were given in hi:- In nor.
The lecture was vuy general in
ii sna tu re.a bounding in rich figures
and humorous anecdotes which
kept the audience in a happy frame
of mind.
In opening his remarks, Mr.
Depew said that he had never
before in all his experience made
an address in a gymnasium. lie
spoke of the trip which his party
was making and his surprise at the
wonders of the Golden State. Me
came, he Paid, as an elder brother
from Vale with its two hundred
years of tradition, yet here was a
prosperous, vigorous condition, the
munificence of its founder having
accomplished the work of a century
in a day. He was glad to see two
great institutions of learning in the
state, for there could never be too
many such. Even the academies
were good â€”they were like the Ken
tuckian's whiskey, all good, but
some better than others.
The founder of this University
was cited as an instance of a man
"coming from nothing, creating a
great everything, and recognizing
the responsibility attendant upon
great success, to use its product
wisely for the benefit of the public
of the state where he lived."
Concerning self-made men the
speaker asserted that all men were
in a sense self-made men, which
was especially true as to college
men. General Garfield was se
lected as the noblest type of a self
made man.
"There is one fault in every col
lege," said Mr. Depew. "and that is
a belief that genius can accomplish
anything without work. Such be
lievers are a nuisance in every
way, for there is nothing in the
world worth having that does not
require hard, honest work."
A short dissertation on athletics
of today as compared with those of
the speaker's college days called
forth much merriment. Reference
was made to the defeat of Dun ra
ven and of the Cambridge athletes
by American sportsmen.
Mr. Depew urged the need of tin'
study of oratory, which iie said
was dying out in colleges. He fur
ther advised that if a student de
sired, he could find many an idle
hour in which he might be im
proving himself.
A compliment was paid to co-ed
ucational institutions, and the be
lief was expressed that the time had
come when women should receive
just as good an education as was
given to men. Mr. Depew closed
with a pertinent quotation from
Kingsley.
