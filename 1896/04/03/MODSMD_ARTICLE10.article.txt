A sTitiicrNQ injustice in the ar
rangements for most of our student
entertainments is the fact that there
is no limit placed upon the num
ber of tickets sold to any one party.
It is entirely possible, under the
present management, for one per
son to buy up all the best seats in
the house either for the purpose of
speculation or for the benefit of
himself and friends.
The evil effects of the present
system were strikingly apparent at
the sale of the "'Said Pasha"' tick
ets. The first half dozen persons
in line secured all the desirable
seats, while persons tenth or
twelfth in the line had to content
themselves with second-rate tick
ets. The rule observed by all iirst
elass city theaters limiting the
number of seats to be sold to each
person should be adopted here.
