Tomouuow afternoon eighteen
healthy exponents of physical cul
ture for women will line up on the
Armory floor at San Francisco to
demonstrate that their sex is n< t
necessarily the weaker, though the
fairer one. We have the greatest
faith in the ability of our repre
sentatives, and our support andl
good wishes go with them.
Nevertheless, the winning or los-1
ing of this one game is, a> it should !
be in all college athletic*, subordi
nate to the moral effect. If theath-l
letic women of the sister university
can prove to this part of the world
that femininity is not weakness
and that enlightened, higher edu
cation means "a sound mind in a
sound body" for women as well as
for men, they will have accom
plished a result far greater than
the bringing of victory or defeat
for one side or the other.
