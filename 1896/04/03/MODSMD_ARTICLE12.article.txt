It will indeed be a hard matter
to estimate the amount of good
that will accrue to the University
through the recent trip of the Glee
and Mandolin Clubs to the south
ern cities of the state. Although
financially not a success, it must be
remembered that it is not a matter
of dollars and cents that determines
whether an enterprise of this kind
has been successful or not; it is the
quantity of advertising and favor
aide notice that a university re
ceives through the representatives
it has sent out; and it is safe to

say that the past trip was unusually
successful in that respect. In all
the towns that were visited the
name of Stanford University was
brought very prominently I<> pub
lic notice, and numbers of people
who before had only a vague idea
of Stanford University, are now,
through their contact with the vbi -
ing students, more or less conver
sant with her history and methods.
The trip was a pronounced sceial
and artistic success, and the high
order of the concerts, together with
the gentlemanly bt havicr of the I
men tit all times and under all cir
cumstances, reflects great credit j
upon the members of the two clul s. j
This is the first tour tiny of
our university organizations have j
undertaken under student body I
management, and it is difficult to |
forecast the feelinu; with which the I
results of the venture will be re-j
ceived.
