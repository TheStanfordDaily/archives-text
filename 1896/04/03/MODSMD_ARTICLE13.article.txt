### HOWARD FIELDING 
Convritrht, 1804.

"rsoe ncre. Mr. lJangs,'" he said one
«!ay \v!jcu Harry had been lopping off
a few excrescences from the South
Cove dialect, "every time I open me
trap you jumps oil me neck. 1 can't
learn that dago that you want me to
tall;. W hat's dcr matter wid me closin'
me jaw tor keeps? I'm willin". You
just call time oa me. see? An'any
body what {rets a word out o' me after
that i.a beaut? Does it go?"
"Hut you've got to have something
to say when you get cornered."
"What's dcr matter wid yes an'no?
IVm two words will carry a fellie a
1 • i<;r ways. I'm t'inking?"
"Somi fellow may nail you on the
iicl 1 and try to get p<;ints out of you
on the studies. Remember that Larry
i> a great grind, lie ssupposed to know
everything. Suppose a fellow .should
ask voi! to translate a line of ('(reek?"
"I'd say, very perliteiy: 'Don t be
after botherin' me wid that dago. 1
knows it inesclf, see? An' 1 ain't
givin' it away to the 1 ilet's of youse.'
How would that strike him? Do yer
fink he'd be after ine 011 that lay
again?"
"No, 1 don't think he would," re
joine I Harry, "but you'd lose your job
and I'd have to skip the country."
"Would he tumble to me just from
them fow ""vords?"
"Well. I should say he would. Hut
your suggestion is a good one, and 1
believe you're the man to stick by it.
I'il give you just one sentence to say
a.';.l wc'il j ;>end the next month in get
ting it d.iwn line. Just use 5* every
1 'me y • 1 vet si tick, and don't say any
thing elon any consideration."
".v 11 right. Vou can gamble on me.
What's the sentence?"'
Harry t inight a few minutes and
tlien lie sai l: "It's har.l to decide. It
must be something high toned to fii
Larry's reputation. 1 should say h
ought to be something like this: 'I
never pjrniit my studies to encroach
upon my hours of recreation."
"Say. that's great. That 11 be three
strikes and out for any gillie that fa co
me. .iu.it let me learn them words.
How does t hey go. now?"
Langs repeated them: and he. kept
right on repeating them about live
hundred times a day for the next
month, lill Paddy knew the;u much bet
ter than he knew the alphabet.
In January the make-up of the nine
began to be the principal subject of in
terest throughout tile college. (If
course the name of Lawrence Langs
was never mentioned isi that connec
tion. In fact, it.was randy mentioned
anywhere except in the class room. lie
was one of the least known men in the
college.
i»ut one day there came a change.
Harry iiangs took Paddy by the arm
and h 1 him to that great center of in
ter >1. i ;i». baseball cage.
■ 1 ' Wilki s, the famous catcher,
v>'a . captain ol' the nine tliat year.
"J on any. said Langs, "I've brought
my brother over. He wants to try for
the nine."
11 ( apt. \\ ilkes had not been leaning
<«n a I'di he would have fallen down.
He had heard of Lawrence Lang;, as a
• ••rind of the bluest description. Also,
i'. must be remembered, Paddy was
made up to lit that character, lie wore
sped a*. K (with perfectly plain glasses),
ami had withal the .studious air of a
young man who meditates studying
for the ministrv.

"1 — I'm delighted," stammered
Wilkes.
Then he grasped Paddy cordially by
the hand.
"I'm mighty glad you've come out,"
he said. "We want every man who
plays ball to show up here, and do
it right now. Harvard is going to have
a mighty strong nine this year, anil all
Vale must get up and hustle if we're
going to beat them."
"■S os," said Paddy, in that calm and
studious tone which he had learned
from Lawrence.
It was all he dared to say —all he was
permitted to say under the contract.
Neither the reply nor Paddy's manner
impressed 112 apt. W ilkes as being per
meated with that enthusiasm which
should characterize a candidate for the
nine.
"What position do you play?" asked
the captain. This question could not
be answered by yes or no, and Paddy
turned an appealing 1 eye upon Langs.
"lie pitches—a little," said Langs.
"Hood,"' responded Wilkes. "We're
weak in the box. I'll give him a trial
now. Let into the box, Langs, and I'll
have the fellows bat around."
Paddy removed his spectacles, and
wiped them carefully as he had seen
Lawrence do. Then he handed them
to Langs for safe keeping, and went
to the pitcher's position. The can
didates for the nine looked at him and
smiled. His face still wore the ab
sorbed and mi .i.-.terial air which he
had copied from Lawrence. He looked
like anything else 011 this terrestrial
sphere more than he did like a ball
player.
( apt. Wilkes put on his mask and
gloves, and got behind the plate,
"llcef" Ldwards, who had led the bat
ting of the nine in the previous year,
steppe 1 up and prepared to drive the
first ball pitched through the side of
the huu. 0. Wilkes threw the ball
down. I addy rubbed it on the leg of
hi., pa aiu loons, while he looked up in
to the air with an expression which he
iiad seen on Lawrence's face when a
one < i Horace was puzzling him.
1 hen lie sent in the bull. "Beef"
Howards never knew when it went by
him. lie didn't sec a little piece of it.
lie saw Paddy's arm waveand that was
all. The ball hit Johnny Wilkes on the
center wire of his mask. He did not
even get his hands up. Johnny is a
pretty good catcher, as everybody will
admit, but he is not fortilied against
all the surprises of this mortal life.
And if a Latling gun had opened lire
on him he would not have been more
astonished than he wa.s then. The
mask protected him from injury, but
he saw morr> stars than are set down on
any reliable astronomical chart.
He walked slowly toward the ball,
which had gone to the roof and then
come down in a corner. Without say
ii g a word he tossed it back to Paddy.
I hit no was ready next time.
"Lcof' Edwards struck out. They
aII struck out. Wilkes took a turn at
the bat, and he had seven strikescalled
011 him before he found the ball.
! '.ut this 1 riumph did not make Paddy
lo .e Li head or forget his part. He
continued throughout the practice to
wear the look of one whose daily food
is locelt roots. And, faithful to his
agreement, he did not open his mouth.
