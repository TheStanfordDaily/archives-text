As was expected, the meeting of
the associated students last Mon
day afternoon resulted in an enthu
siastic demonstration in favor of
sending the track team to the East.
There is a feeling here, we think,
that whatever l'rof. Edwards, who
spoke at this meeting, throws his
interest into, is pretty certain to
succeed somehow. It he should
preach popular subscription iigain,
as he did for foot ha 11 once and for
an Eastern trip another time, the
university would probably "pun
gle,"' but so many benefits are in
view that it may not be necessary.
It is even said that many fellows
arc buying tickets in considerable
quantities to the Stanford-Califor
nia basket-ball game, tickets which
they can not use themselves of
course, and so must give them to
their friends of the other sex. We
do not forget, however, that we
meet Stanford in lield and track
athletics, and there is a decided
and very wholesome feeling that
the day is past for three-to-one
scores ii favor of California. We
hope it is.
The university spring field-day
conies Saturday, April 11. The
track was never in better shape,
and several university records
ought to go. We have an idea that
the mile run will be lowered by
llrown, ' I .KS, the shot-put by Lloyd,
! i>V) (perhaps the pole-vault by the
same man), and the hammer-throw
by Edgren. It would not be sur
prising to see the mile walk low
ered too by Captain iMenvin. And
the bicycle race will certainly be
lowered if Crofts enters.
A good deal of interest is shown
over the intercollegiate debate. It
is rumored that our team is going
down —indeed, have already been
down —to the public square in < Oak
land to harangue ilie mob that con
gregates there nightly to listen to
all sorts of agitators. If this unu
sual report be true it will be a new
and perhaps very useful training
for them. Who knows but that
something of the kind would lead
to the frequent sight of college men
imparting by public speech to the
less fortunate somewhat of the
sound and sure wisdom they are
supposed to acquire in their class
rooms? The Herkeleyan.
