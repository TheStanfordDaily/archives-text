# Sugar and Sugar Refining—J.M. Stillman.

### 
The history of sugar and sugar
refining was made the subject of a
lecture I »y Professor Stillinan last
evening in the Popular Science

Course. A brief outline of the lect
ure follows:
The writings of the ancients have
many allusions to honey, but none
to sugar or the sugar cane. We do
not have to go far back into the
history of civilization in Europe to
find the time when sugar formed
no part of the bill of fare.
The desire for sweets and spices
is apparently a feature of the
transition of races of men from
flesh-eating habits to agricultural
habits and a diet of grain and vege
tables. Esquimaux, Hottentots,
and other flesh-eating tribes today
are not greatly addicted to the use
of sweets, though the Hottentots
are said to collect honey for sale to
ot her tribes.
Sugar, which now replaces honey
as the main source of sweetness,oc
curs in very many plant juices and
fruits, notably in the sugar cane,
sugar beet, sorghum, palms, and
sugar maple. The home of the
sugar caneand sugar making is an
cient India, in the valleys of the
Ganges and Euphrates where it
has doubtless been cultivated for
thousands of years. Thence its
knowledge spread to China. Some
where near the beginning of the
Christian era, perhaps, and on the
west, the Persians became ac
quainted with the culture and
making of sugar.
No real knowledge of sugar in
Europe, however, existed in the 7th
century when the Byzantine
emperors and the Arabians invaded
Persia. The Arab conquerors bore
the siurar cane through their west
ern conquests to Egypt, Morocco,
and to Spain, and the cities of
southern Europe became acquainted
with sugar through their trade with
the Arabians, though not perhaps
before the Uth and 10th centuries.
The first crusade (109(>-9) served
as the first great world's fair and
brought to the knowledge of the
residents of France, Germany, Eng
land, and other northern nations
the knowledge of sugar.
From this time on its use spread;
the Portuguese and Spaniards dis
eoverors carried the sugar cane
to America and the West Indies.
Many authors have supposed sugar
cane to be native to America, but
this is not so; probably all has
come from India.
About the beginning of this cen
tury the beet sugar industry began
to develop in German}', and soon
after in France. Now beet sugar
shares the world's market with
cane *ugar about .equally. Prices
have fallen with the development
of the industry from about two
dollars and a half a pound in Eng
land in 1250, A. 1)., to four cents a
pound in IXSIO.
The history of refining processes
was briefly sketched from the crude
methods of India and China to the
modern refining process. •
