The Stanford co-eds showed their j
worth hy defeating Berkeley's has-j
ket-ha 11 team Saturday bv a score'
of two t<> one. The game took
place in the Armory Hall of San

the superiority of the Stanford
players in accuracy in throwing the
hull, hy their quickness and agility,
hy their cool and careful playing,
and finally hy their team work.
The Stanford team, accompanied (
hy a contingent of co-eds diaper-j
oned hy Prof. Mary Roberts Smith,
left for San Francisco in the morn
ing. The girls were confident, al
though, of course, they experienced
:i 11 the doubts of athletes before an |
important contest.
Armory Hall was filled with fem-1
inine spectators, and as usual the
Berkeley sympathizers largely pre-;
dominated.
The officials were Mrs. W. E. j

ternately as umpire and referee.

The Berkeley girls wore white!
sweaters, navy-hlue bloomers, and j
black stockings. On their sweaters I
were the college letters in blue and
gold, and each girl wore a rosette
ot blue and gold ribbon. The j
Stanford co-eds wore black bloom
ers, cardinal sweaters, and cardi
nal silk caps. The Berkeley girls
were taller and heavier, but not so
active and supple.
Captain McCray won the toss-up,
and the south goal was chosen, j
The ball was tossed in one way |
and then another by the eager
players. Soon, however. Stanford J
made a foul by tackling. This
gave Berkeley a free throw for!
goal which was unsuccessful. The!
play commenced again; Berkeley J
fouled this time and Miss Clark I
made a successful try for goal.
The Stanford girls were jubilant, j
Berkeley then secured the hall but j
lost it by a fumble and fouled soon
afterward. Miss Tucker failed to
make a goal for Stanford. Berke
ley t hen showed some good t browing
accompanied by some wild throws.
Captain McCray made a long run.
Berkeley got the ball and failed in
several trys for goal on account of
strong interference by Stanford.
Then Miss Jones of Berkeley by a
good throw made a goal for Berkeley.
The score stood at the end of the
lirst half one to one.
Stanford opened the second half
with the determination to win.
The Stanford team showed good
catching and interference. Berk
eley soon made a foul and Miss
Tucker made the score 2 to 1 in :
favor of Stanford amid the cheers
of the spectators. Stanford fouled (
but Miss Brownsill did not make a
goal. The ball went back and forth

and the final score was two to one.
The star player of the game was
Miss McCray, who made some good
gains running with the hall and
played a cool game throughout.
Miss Merritt also glayed a strong
game. Miss Tucker and Miss
Morley made good throws. Miss
Williams and Miss IJrownsill were
Berkeley's strongest players.
The game was won l>y good play
