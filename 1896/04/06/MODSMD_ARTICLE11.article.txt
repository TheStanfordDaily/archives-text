What is the matter with our
interest in track athletics? Here
we are within three weeks of the
intercollegiate meet, (he truck in a
vile condition, so bad in fact that
some of our best men are injured,
and nil because a cent can not be
procured from the student body.
Are we going to go against Berk
eley and make a poor showing, or
are we going to give them a nar
rower escape than they have ever
had on the Coast before? The ans
wer all lies with the students. If
they are content to make track ath
letics a side issue to every other
college sport and enterprise, if they
'satisfied to see a half dozen
loyal Stanford athletes bearing the
brunt of the whole track business,
even to doing manual work on the
track and slaving to keep up the
interest of other athletes, then the
answer must be that we are willing
to meet Berkeley each season
simply to be ignobly defeated.
We can not believe that such is
the case. We know that students
generally would be as delighted
over a field defeat of our rivals as
they would over a victory in any
other branch of sport. Every day
\\e hear tlie remark I would give
anything to see Stanford defeat
Berkeley this year.'' Often the en
thusiast limits his valuation of a
victor}' to dollars and cents. Now
it may be stated that sufficient
funds at the present time may put
the men in condition fora hot con
test with Berkeley. The University
of California has three athletes to
our one and they have the advan
tage of several years start in build
ing up their athletics. Neverthe
less our athletes are all good
conscientious workers and they will
give Berkeley a good hard light
this year. Why,should they not
have the sympathy and support of
the students? We can hardly
blame the remark heard recently,
that "Stanford has no college spirit
or else it is sleeping pretty
soundly.'" If it is asleep let it be
aroused. The possibility of a vic
tor}* over Berkeley on the track a
week before they leave for the East,
even though a mere possibility,
should set the Stanford blood ting
ling. li would mean as much as a
football victory for Stanford and
would put us near the front in the
a'hletic world. hpbpwsibhmum
