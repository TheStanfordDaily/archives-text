Let the students turn out nightly
to witness the track work. Let us
not rest all burdens of the track on
a few men. Let us remember that
a training table and a professional
rubber are more essential to a track
athlete than any other man that
represents a college. Lastly, let us
provide the means for getting
these essentials for our men and
for putting our track in condition
immediately.
The Daily Palo Ai/ro will head
a subscription list to which we
trust all will subscribe. Several
fraternities have already volun
teered their willingness to help ihe
track men financially, and if all
who can afford, faculty members,
fraternities, and individual stu
dents, will co-operate, our track
athletics will soon be on a sound
basis and the athletes will do the
rest on the next tield-dav.
