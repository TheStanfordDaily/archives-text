It is usual to preserve a considera
-1 ;lt* degree of reticence regarding the
pei'l'oimanee of candidates for an ath
letic team. Hoastfnlness is the least
common of all oll'enses at colleges.
he works of the athletics praise them
and not their own lips. The captain
< 112 the nine always says modestly that
he will do his best, and that his in?n
will do their best, and he leaves the re
mainder to the official scorer.

not be kept quiet. It was all over the
college Ilefore morning, and the name of
Lawrence l>an.";s was more common in
conver..ation than the deiinite article.
V* hen he appeared at prayers he was
the object of ad' ration which was very
nearly sacrilegious, considering the os
tensible purpose of the gathering.
On the grounds aniLin the class room
many iellows took occasion to be kind
to him. lie was a freshman, and he
looked like one. but several upper class
men spoke to"liim in a way that was
calculated to make him think that he
had been in college several years.
Lawrence was less susceptible to flat
tery Mian most young men. yet he
could not help admitting to himself
that this consideration would have
been agreeable if it had been honestly
acquired. It grew and grew in the
succeeding weeks till it became posi
tively harrowing. Lawrence was well
in the lead of his class, but everybody
forgot it. When the nine came back
from its practice tour in the ; j ring re
ee: she was the ball player and noth
ing else. It was as impossible for any
body to think of him aside from his
connection with the nine, as it is to
separate ('apt. Kidd from his piracy.
< ; f course. Lawrence remained hid
den during that recess and Faddy had
the character all to himself, lie did
very well with it, thanks to the con
tinual prompting of Harry Langs, who
traveled with the nine.
To Lawrence such a period of retire
ment, from the world would ordinarily
have been no hardship. He was always
glad to be alone with his hooks. Hut
<>n this occasion it happened that Miss
Lome was in New Haven, and Law
rence knew of it. Now Lawrence had
been powerfully impressed by Flor
ence's beauty, and he counted the days
which must elapse before I'addy could
return and set. him free. When the
distinguished pitcher at. last appeared
Lawrence made it the lirst business of
the existence which had been restored

to him, to go and call upon the young
lady.
She received him in an entirely new
way. She had appeared to take an un
usual interest in him when lie had first
met her. but it had been tempered by
the shadow of her displeasure. She
I had argued with him severely on the
I question of his duty to tne university,
i She believed that her arguments had
J given to Yah the greatest pitcher thai
the shade of old F.li had ever looked
down upon with approval. And she
received Lawrence as one whom she
| hi> 1 saved from oblivion, and set upon
j the pinnacle of fame. There was no
concealment about it. She asked for
his gratitude and he gave it. Lewil
dered by the light of her eyes In-told
her that he had no other ambition in
life except, to shut Harvard out without
a base hit. and she replied that he was
! her knight and must wear her favor in
every contest. They talked baseball
! for three delightful hours and Lnw-
I renee, who had committed to memory
' on her account the newspaper accounts
| of all Yale's games, acquitted himself
almost as well as Faddy O'Toole conhl
