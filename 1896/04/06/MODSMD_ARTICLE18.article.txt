### 
The latest publication of the be
hind Stanford Jr. University is a
memoir by Vernon L. Kellogg, as
sociate professor of entomology, en
titled "New Mallophyga, I ; with
special reference to a collection
made from maritime birds of the
l!ay of Monterey, California. This
is the fourth of the series of con
tributions to biology from the Hop
kins Seaside Laboratory, edited by
Professors Charles 11. Gilbert and
Oliver P. Jenkins and issued under
the patronage of Alr. Timothy Hop
kins of Menlo Park.
The paper presents the descrip
tions and figures of one new genus
and thirty-eight new species of
nialloplniga, together with identifi
cations and figures of twenty-two
species previously described, but
now, with few exceptions, first de
termined as parasites of American
birds.
"The mallophaga constitute a
small order of parasitic insects
which live externally on the bodies
of birds and mammals. The in
sects are small, one tenth of an
inch being perhaps an average
length, wingless, and have biting
mouth parts, with which they feed
on the feathers or hair of their host,
not sucking blood ?is the true iiee
do." â€”/ nl mil action, p'njc /.
Prof. Kellogg's paper is the first
systematic treatment in America of
ibis order of parasites, and is de
signed as an introduction to their
study by American students. The
present paper deals with the species
collected from water birds, and will
be followed by a second treating
with the species discovered onshore
birds. It contains an account of
their structure, life history, and
habits, and a classification of the
families and genera.
The style is clear and concise.
The plates are very fine and exact,
being the work of Miss Edna
Hyatt, artist for the botanical de
partment of the University of Ne
braska. The price is fifty cents.
