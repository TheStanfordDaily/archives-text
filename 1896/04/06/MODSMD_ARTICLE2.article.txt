Note from Mrs. Stanford:

Basket-Hall Tram, Stanford t'niver
ftity, Cat. .
My dear young friend: 1 re
ceived your communication dated
March 2 enclosing two tickets for
the "Basket-Ball Game." Please
accept my sincere thanks for the
polite attention which is satisfaction
sufficient for me without the added
enjoyment of the game. I have the
usual weakness of human nature to
highly appreciate all tender, kind
attentions from the young. J some
times feel that all I have left me
and all that 1 can claim in this life
is the love and prayers of the stu
dents of the Stanford University.
Regretfully yours,
Mas. J>elani> Stanford.
