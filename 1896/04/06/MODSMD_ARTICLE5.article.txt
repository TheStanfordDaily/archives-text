# A 						Baseball Defeat.
## 
### 
The Stanford Varsity met with
defeat in baseball on Saturday, the
ex-Stanford Stars winning by the
score of 7 to 4. Walton's all
round work in batting, base-run
ning, and fielding, and the batting
and fielding of Harrelson and
Sheehan were factors in the victory
of the visitors.
It can not be said that the result
was simply due to an "off-day" on
the part of the home team. It was
the result of the style of play used
by our men. They depended en
tirely on the battery to do the work
which should have been divided
among nine men. By waiting for
balls to reach them and by slow
ness in throwing the visitors were
allowed repeatedly to gain first and
second base. The principal weak
ness of the home team is at the bat
and in base-running.
Three of the men continually
tried to "kill" the ball, and in con
sequence either struck out or
knocked flies. Young got one over
Downing'* head but a Berkeley
fielder could easily have captured
it. The players have no ability to
"pull out" a game by a batting
rally, which is so necessary to good
play.
Many runs are lost by slowness
in getting down to first. In Sat
urday's game two men stood be
tween the bases waiting to see if
Harrelson would drop Harris'
liner; a triple play was the result.
Such batting and base running will
lose us the games with Berkeley if
not soon remedied.
