# On the Cinders.

### 
The need for more funds for the
support of track athletics is be
coming daily more apparent. In
spite of the individual worn done
by members of the team, the track
and in fact the whole oval, is in
miserable shape. The truth is that
students who do not understand
track repairing can not, no matter
how much time they give to the
work, keep the cinders in good con
dition. The one hundred yard
straightaway, in particular, is
lumpy and full of holes. Danger
ous injuries are likely to happen at
any time. In fact several minor
casualties have occurred, and only
good luck has prevented them from
being serious. Burke, one of our
most promising novices, has been
entirely incapacitated for training
by the constant jolting and shaking
up lie 11ms undergone on account of
the condition of the track.
Another serious drawback to ef
fective work is the lack of a train
ing table. It is a fact that not one
of our best men are in proper phys
ical condition. Most of the can
didates live at Encina, and hall
food, no matter how well suited to
the average student, is notoriously
unfit for training. Brunton, in
particular, is decidedly "stale,"and
although his condition is probably
due in part to his having worked
too hard, lack of proper food must
be mainly blamed.
We have the enthusiasm and the
athletic material fora first-class
team; but we can not go further
without a proper supply of the sin
ews of war.
