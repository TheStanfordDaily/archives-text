All who ride the bicycle will he wearing
the Deimel Linen-Mesh Underwear.
Those who do now are enthusiastic in
praising it.
People who exercise much, such sis
wheelmen, ball players and lovers of
other kinds of athletic sport, ought to
appreciate the invaluable advantages of
our Linen-Mesh Underwear, which ab
sorbs the perspiration and dries quiekly,
hence feels warm and comfortable dur
ing exercise and after; which neither
overheats the body while exercising, nor
(thills it when at rest, and which never
clings to the body like a wet woolen or
cotton garment. These facts speak for
themselves.
Mr. Lewis Herreshoff of Defender
fame, has this to say: "I think the
Deimel Linen-Mesh should be worn by
all who ride the bicycle; you should lay
far more stress on that."
