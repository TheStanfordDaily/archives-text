# Easter Service.

### 
The Easter sermon was deliv
ered by Rev. W. A. Brewer of Han
Mateo. The text chosen was St.
John, xv, 18: "Greater love hath
no man than this, that a man
lay down bis life for bis friends."
To risk one's life is the popular
test of high courage. The man
who holds bis life in his hand that
he may save the life of another is
often the hero of a whole country
side. Oftentimes ;i nation does
him honor. Beside the station
there stands a tramp; he represents
the off-scouring of civilization; a
train approaches; a child totters
upon the track; it is a critical mo
ment,; the tramp sees her and
snatches her from her fate. Our
tramp becomes a hero. As he re
store;- the child to its mother we
grasp bis hand. lie is a better
man for bis deed. As a lens brings
together rays of light, so bis deed
brought togfether all the good parts
of his nature. He is the hero of
the hour —but the hour, how brief
and 11 eeting! Our tramp is still a
tramp, waiting to steal a ride. Is
not. then, our interpretation of the
text erroneous, or at least inade
quate?
Gallantry is oftentimes a vain
thing. There is no heroism in sac
rificing one's life recklessly. The
important thing is not always the
laying down of life, but the living
of it. I venture to change the text
to read thus: "Greater love than
this hath no man, that be live his
life for others." This was what
characterized Christ. He lived for
others, not merely died for them.
Our lives are our own; we can live
them for ourselves or for others.
If there is a day in the whole
year that is most worthy of setting
apart, it is Easter day. Spring
time with its flowers and verdure
seems to add to the sweetness of the
day. By the Easter service and
Easter festival we are carried back
to the Easter nineteen hundred
vears ago. We see the life of Christ
in its entirety, and are led to ask
ourselves, What is my life? To
what degree am 1 giving my life to
my friends? The life of Jesus
gives the key to all such heart
sea rchings—furnishes a criterion
by which to judge our lives. His
words are simple, yet we feel that
there is an infinitude of meaning
behind them. As his words were,
so were his actions. The absence
of all pretentions shows the depth
and grandeur of hissoul. Simplic
ity and greatness go together. All
our great men are characterized by
simplicity of speech and action.
Simplicity does not imply a lack
of courage. Did not the Savior
take a lash and cleanse the temple?
It is claimed that the growth of
wealth and the prevalence of
luxury of our day makes it impos
sible to reproduce either the temper
or the character of our forefathers.
A great preacher has asked why
our Christanity is so poor and
meagre and depressed. Might it
not be that we have forgotten the
love and the life of Christ? We
are told, and it is true, that there
has been a fierce struggle for in
dividual existence and that our
progress has depended upon the
survival of the fittest in this strug
gle. But a new law is coming to he

universally accepted —the law of
the struggle for others —the living
of our liven for our friends. We are
coming to interpret aright the
words of our God: "Greater love
hath no man than this, that a man
lay down his life for his friends."
