It is very gratifying to us as stu
dents to read the many favorable
press notices in the papers of
Southern California called forth by
the visits of several Stanford pro
fessors to that part of the state dur
ing the vacation. We are sure that
the praise of the lecturers, un
stinted as it was, was fully de
served and will do much to spread
the respect and influence already
enjoyed by Stanford. A few trips
<>112 this kind on the part of profess
ors will greatly benefit the Univer
sity which we love.
