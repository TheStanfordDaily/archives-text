Ik we are beaten on the track by
Berkeley this year, it will not be
through lack of hard work and en
thusiasm on the part of our older
track men. As a general rule the
men have trained faithfully in all
kinds of weather and have been un
tiring in their enthusiasm. It is a
fact not generally known to the
student body at large that all the
manual labor of keeping the track
in order, such as rolling, laying
pipe, and unloading cinders has
been done by the candidates for the
track team themselves. This is
the spirit that wins battles, and we
only need a continuance of that
Niine feeling.
