Thk action of the Associated
Students last Friday afternoon in
throwing the future election of the
editor-in-chief and business mana
ger of the Daily Palo Alto into
the hands of that body has added
another to the long list of changes
that have heen brought about in
the management of student affairs
this year. At the beginning of the

year the only college interests of
any importance under the control
of the student body were those of
football, baseball, and track ath
letics. Since then the arm of that
organization has been slowly but
surely reaching out until it has
gathered into its fold almost, every
club that can properly come under
its supervision.
Whether this has been a wise
move or not on its part of course
remains yet to be determined.
This University has a system of
managing its student affairs differ
ent from that of any other large
university, and it will take more
than a few weeks or a few months
to determine whether this hitherto
untried scheme shall be a success.
The recent trip of the Glee and
Mandolin Clubs has demonstrated
that there are certain risks con
nected with the undertaking which
can not be overlooked and which
add to the problem a great element
of uncertainty; but on the other
hand the same trip has shown the
great moral influence which the
Associated Students, through its
relations with the management, can
exert upon the conduct of the en
terprise. At any rate as regards
this particular way of managing
and controlling college institutions
we are making history daily, and
every new development of its pos
sibilities will be watched with keen
interest.
