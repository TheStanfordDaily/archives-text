Sir: The patriotic and'willing
stand the fraternities have taken in
coming to the aid of the track is
gratifying and highly commend
able. But what of the rest of the
student body? Are we going to al
low it to be said that all the Stan
ford spirit is in the fraternities?
Are we to allow the burdens to lie
borne by a few?
Let us contribute freely and at
once. Let us organize subscription
clubs and inaugurate some plan by
which money may be quickly and
easily raised. Let nr. not wait to
be called upon but do it of our own
accord. Let every one give what
he can, according to his means.
Berkeley is raising $2,000 to send
a team East. Can not we raise
$200 to give our team, for two
weeks, those things our opponents
have had fora whole season? It is
often asserted that Berkeley has
more college spirit than we have,
but she surely has not ten times as
much. A training table, a profes
sional rubber, and a good track are
absolutely necessary for the success
of a track athletic team. Therefore
let every one do his duty that Stan
ford may, for the first time, have a
victorious track team.
Enthusiastically, N. K.
