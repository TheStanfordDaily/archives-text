The finals for the intercollegiate
representatives were played be
tween Freeman, *99, and Piclier,
'98. The contest was spirited and
very exciting, and resulted in a
victory for Freeman, as the follow
ing score shows: 6-4, 6-0, 6-0.
Freeman's game was very strong
and sure.
With such a team as this to rep
resent us in the intercollegiate
match our chances are very prom
ising. The lirst game will be
played next Saturday. The
singles will be played in the morn
ing and their doubles in the after
noon.
