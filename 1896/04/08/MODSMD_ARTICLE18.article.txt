Invitations to the big intercol
legiate debate are now ;it the
Registrar's office. Stanford ath
letes and speakers have always
heen handicapped in public per
formances in San Francisco bv
having to appear before a crowd
composed mainly of U. (J. sym
pathizers. Any assistance in
swelling the Stanford contingent
at the debate will be of material
benefit to our speakers. For this
reason it is urgently requested that
all students having friends in San
Francisco should send them in
vitations.
