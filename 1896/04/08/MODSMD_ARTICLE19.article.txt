Coming as it does from a man of
so high standing among present
day orators, Chauncey M. Depew's
plea for the cultivation of oratory
among college sindents is of speeia I
interest. Notwithstanding the
gradual encroachment of the press
upon the prerogatives of the pulpit
and platform so that today it
wields by far the greater influence,
there certainly can he no doubt
that, the orator will always con
tinue a great power in human
society and that the man who is
well trained in public speaking
will always have a, great advan
tage over his fellows of equal ability
in other respects.
hi litis connection it is interest
ing, and gratifying, to notice the

increase in tlie membership of the
literary societies at Stanford dur
ing tlu' past year and the growing
interest taken in the debating at
| this University. If Stanford's en
thusiasm in this direction does not
j cease to grow, and if at the same
j time the apathy which is so de
precated by Mr. Depew continues
I to hover over oursister universities,
I . ~
[it is not at all unlikely that the
! distinction long enjoyed by the
Sunny South in the production of
orators may ere long be transferred
to the ({olden West.
