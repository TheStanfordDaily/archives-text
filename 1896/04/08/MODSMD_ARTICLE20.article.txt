# Old Eli's Favorite Son.
## A 						Revelation of the Romantic and Remarkable Career of Lawrence Bangs, the Famous Yale Athlete. 
### HOWARD FIELDING 
CoDvrifht, 1804.

Lawrence. absorbed in study, sat in
his room. The time passed more quick -
ly thun lie knew. Suddenly lie heard
a sound us if pandemonium had slipped
its cable and was drifting down on
him. He peered out between the
blinds; The street was tilling with
people. A street band whieh had been
picked up by the way came marching*
along, its seven members playing
, very cue his own tune in the key that
suited him best.
And behind the band came Paddy,
borne upon the shoulders of a yelling
mob of cutliusiasts. lie escaped from
them some way, and ran into the
house.
"We did 'em up." he said to Law
rence. "They were easy fruit."
"Ami you distinguished yourself, no
doubt'.'"
"1 guess 1 did. Hear those frillies
howlin' outside. I like it all right, but

I'm (load tired now. Go out and take
your turn a t it."
So Lawrence went to the door after
a sufficient interval, and stood on the
st.op.su moment, looking 1 out over the
great crowd on the street.
"Now. all together!" yelled some
one: "a triple round for Larry Bangs!" )
The cheers rattled the windows.
Then a score of students swept down
or Lawrence and carried him away, i
lie was like a man in a dream. The 1
illusion overpowered him. lie tasted
the sweet savor of popularity, and for
got that it was not really his. lie I
waved his hat to the crowd with the
air of a conqueror, and all the fellows 1
cried with one voice:
i-S! HANGS!!"
CHAPTER VII.
AN OBJECT OF ADMIRATION.
Lawrence, borne above the crowd,
yielded himself absolutely to the in
toxication of popularity. He was the
liilftrest man in New Haven for an hour

sit least, and lie thoroughly er.joye
the sensation. The route of his tri
umphal procession chanced to take
him by the house where Florence
lived, and she was standing 1 on the
step 1 ., surrounded by a dozen other
girls, when he passed.
'i here was a shrill chorus of ap
plause, and all the girls waved hand
kerchiefs. Florence was so proud of
him that the tears came into her eyes.
She felt very small and unimportant
to lie the sweetheart of so distin
guished a man. It seemed to her that
many of the other girls looked more
worthy of the honor They were tall
an i queenly, while she was only livt
feet four i:i high-heeled shoes. And
then she remembered that her per
suasion had made Lawrence what lie
was. ilut for her ho might never have
been famous. And with that thought
; he became so tall that she coul l look
over the heads of all the other girl
and see what was going on as well as
if they hadn't been there.
