# On the Track.
## 
### 
One of the most encouraging
signs of this year's revival in track
athletics is the persistent training
of new and green men. In former
years we have frequently heen able
to get out a great number of men
at the beginning of the season, hut
almost without exception they
have dropped out after a few weeks'
work. Toombs, for example, had
no more athletic ability when he
began training in his first year
than a dozen other freshmen who
came out. The difference was
that he has kept at it and has made
an athlete of himself.
Among the green men .lack and
Wootten are especially distinguish
ing themselves, the former in the

walks and the latter in the sprints.
Jack has in him the making of a
good athlete. lie is built for the
event, is getting into first-class form,
and seems to have the necessary j
pluck and endurance. NVootten is ;
a novice at sprinting, but he gives
good promise.
The student body is responding
liberally to the call for funds, and
it looks as though we were sure to
have a training table after all. It
is sadly needed, as most of the men i
are "going stale."
