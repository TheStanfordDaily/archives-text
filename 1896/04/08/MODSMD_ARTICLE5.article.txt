The practice game of baseball i
yesterday afternoon was evenly;
contested in spite of the fact that
the second nine made twelve errors
to the Varsity's four. The playing
lacked snap, but the hitting was]
more on a line than is usually the j
case.
The Varsity now ranks as fol-!
lows in batting: Wight .400, Tay- i
lor .848, Jeffs .840, Sharp .820, Har
ris .824, Thompson .817, Freeman i
.259, Staushery .257, Young .28f>.!
McLaine .217. In the four Varsity i
games they stand thus: fcsharp.4ll, i
Thompson 400, Stansbery .400.
Wight .875, Taylor .250. Freeman'
.250, Young .280, Jeffs .187, Harris,!
.100, McLaine .071. The club-bat
ting in the Varsity games is .250 j
and club-lielding .800, each at least
50 points too low.
