# Argument of " Said Pasha."
## 
### 
In view of the approaching per
formance of "Said Pasha," the fol
lowing outline <>112 the story ma}' be
of interest:
The scene of the tirst act is tit
Constantinople. Said Pasha, a
Turkish diplomat, is preparing for
a pleasure trip around the world.
Serena, his daughter, is anxious to
accompany him because she does
not want to he parted from her
lover, Hansen Hey, who is Pasha's
first officer. The Pasha, who does
not favor this attachment, forhids
her. Meantime there are a couple
of adventurers introduced, Hadad
and Nockey. Hadad, in search
of his daughter stolen from him
in India, when a ha by, seven
teen years before, desires to reach
that country, which he finds to he
the Pasha's first destination. In
structing Nockey to personate an
idiot brother (with a vocabulary
limited to the interrogation
''Why?") whom he is desirous of
taking to a certain shrine in hopes
of his recovery, Hadad asks that
they may lie of the party, to which
the Pasha consents. Then becom
ing aware of the dilemma of Hassen
Hey and Serena, Hadad endeavors
to establish a claim on them by
suggesting that Serena shall dis
guise herself as a sailor and thus
accompany her lover.
During the preparation of this
scheme, finally carried out in spite
of the Pasha's suspicions, there ar
rives a rich young Mexican, Terano,
in search of the ideal woman of
whom he has dreamed. The Pasha,
with an eye to business, parades
the ladies of his harem, hoping to
sell one of them, and even sends
for bis daughter, as lie considers
the Mexican a desirable son-in-law.
Hut Terano, still unsatisfied, ac
cepts an invitation to go to India
with the Pasha, who hopes to ar
range there a match that may be to
his own advantage; and the curtain
falls as the ship sails away with all
the principals on board.
The scene of the second act is
laid in the little village of Altara,
India. For several months Alti,
the adopted daughter of the Rajah
of Altara, has been afflicted with
some psychologic ailment, which
bailies the skill of the local learned
men. Hadad and Nockey appear
on the scene. Overhearing the
Kajah lamenting, they conceive tin;
idea of offering their services as
doctors. The Kajah accepts their
offer but has them watched. In at
tempting to leave Altara they are
seized and are about to be put to
death when the arrival of the Pasha
and the rest of his party creates a
diversion in their favor.
The Kajah is made to believe
that the Pasha is a famous expert
in psychology, and claims his ser
vices for Alii. Terano recognizes
in Alti tin; face of his dreams; Alti
in Terano a preordained spirit,
whom she had met in her astral
form.
The Pasha is very much taken
with Alti's beauty, and in trying to
gain an interview meets Kalah
Sojali. the Kajah's sister, a very
susceptible creature of uncertain
age, who has blossomed into the
"sere and yellow leaf" of single
blessedness on account of the vacil
lating character of her affections.

The Pasha, being near-sighted,
makes violent love to her, mistak
ing her for Alti. Hadad and
Nockev, upon whom Kalah had
previously lavished her affection,
overhear the interview, and upon
the announcement of her enormous
wealth, enter the li.-ls with the
Pasha for her hand. The Pasha,
whose exchequer has become de
pleted. is anxious to gai*i her for
himself, and upon her announce
ment of her inability to choose be
tween them, commands the with
drawal of Iladad and Nockey, and
on their refusal makes things un
pleasant for those worthies.
The Kajah is informed of the
true character of Ir.s distinguished
guest and is only too happy at the
prospect of such a brother-in-law.
Hadad and Nockey are given twen
ty-four hours in which to seek part
ners for their joys and sorrows.
The presence of Terano recalls
Alti from her "spirit life." Hadad
discovers in Alti his long lost
daughter, but is afraid to disclose
the fact to the Kajah. Alti prevails
upon the Pasha to give his consent
to the marriage of Serena and Has
sen Key. A celebration is given in
honor of Alti's recovery. Hadad
and Nockey "meet the enemy''and
are forgiven.
The Pasha invites the Kajah to
accompany him to Constantinople,
and preparations are begun at once
fora speedy departure amid gen
eral wishes fora long life to Said
Pasha.
