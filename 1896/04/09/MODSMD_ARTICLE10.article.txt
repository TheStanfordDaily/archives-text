There are few universities hav
ing sueh a line sheet of water as
San Francisco Bay within a few
miles of their doors that do not
number rowing among their sports.
To keep our engagements with
Berkeley we must be able within a
couple of years from the present
time to put a crew in competition
with our friends across the hav.
The time may seem a long one. but
in reality it is very short when we
consider that at present we have
neither hoathouse, boats, nor oars
men. if the provision calling fora
boat-race is not to be dropped by
mutual consent, it is high time
that some effort should be made in
the direction of overcoming the
many difficulties that will have to
be met before Stanford can dream
of adding acquat ic contests to those
of the gridiron, diamond, and track.
No one will belittle the many bar
riers in the way of training a crew
here. They are certainly very dis
couraging; but difficulties can not
be overcome'by ft policy of letting
tilings slide. The only way is to go
to work and overcome them. If
Stanford is ever to have a Univer
sity crew, we might as well begin
now as ten years later to discuss
the barriers in our way and plan to
remove them.
