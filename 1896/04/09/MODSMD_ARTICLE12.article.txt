## A 						Revelation of the Romantic and Remarkable Career of Lawrence Bangs, the Famous Yale Athlete.

Lawrence wa> forced to leave his ad

and prescribed by the highc: t medical

not been well since Ids lirst encounter

from the table. To him. just then,.

dissatisfied with her. lie had seen the
light in her eyes, the glow on her
cheeks, the ecstasy of pride when he
went, by. All this came back to him,
and not pleasantly.
"She is in love with Paddy O'Toole."
said Lawrence, in his heart. "It is dis
graceful."
Now everybody will readily admit
that if sue!) was the truth. Paddy had
a great deal more right to complain
than Lawrence had. Yet is very hard
to satisfy a young 1 man when he is in
love, and Lawrence became wildly
jealous of Paddy, who had never'met
Florence, and in the natural course of
event-, never would. However, there
was some justification for Lawr • s
feeling*, for lie had not Ix'cn all i ike

"lie will not discuss baseball this
evening." said he to himself, very iinn
' ly. "We will converse upon more seri

call upon 1 ircr.ce. There was a kiss

before her the treasures of his mind,
and captivate her with his knowledge.
To this plan he scrupulously adhered:
and Florence had never thought him
dull before.
She had looked forward to the inter
view with feelings of the liveliest joy,
and the result was a bitter disappoint
ment. She was offended that he did
not claim his reward at once. IJut lu
scorned to do it. f< r he felt that t,lie
prize had been won by his hated rival
lie would not approach the subject
Instead he opened out to her tin
treasure house of his mind, which wa:
really not bad fora freshman. The re
sult was that by half-past eight o'clock
she was not only angry but bored; b .
half-past nine they had cpiarrelod; an 1
at ten. Lawrence took his leave, with
out having mended matters at all in
the last In If hour, and without having
secured his own kiss or the tine that
belonged to Paddy.
'J hi was only the beginning of bit
terness. There was another game, ol
ball a few days later, and Paddy again
distinguished himself, lie shut out
Amherst without a hit. and Amherst
was sur.]> sod to have a 'strong batting
nine that year. IJut Paddy was too
good for anybody's nine that day, and
the visit■ rs merely fanned the air one
after another. Paddy's work was
justly regarded as the very finest arti
ele of ball plaj'ing that ha 1 ever been
seen in .New Haven, and the vasl
crowd simply went, wild over him.
Florence, who had considered herself
estranged from him, shed tears oi peui
tence. She wanted to be; forgiven
right away. So with a great company oi
her rvirl iricrrds, and some men to give
them countenance, she waylaid Pa deb
< / 'l\>< >le as lie wa •>once more beingborn(
away in triumph, and fairly captured
him from the hands of his admirer.
Larry is;", who had been hovering
on the outskirts of the crowd, vie we
this scene with the blackest disma;.
He had deadly fear that in the pre
eiice. of so much loveliness Paddy's
to; "is' might be unloosed. Theyouii"
n ' had developed some signs* of tin: .
iiantry which distinguishes the
wj !i race. On one occasion when h
h.:d been more heartily applauded than
u Iby a bevy of girls in the grand
s'nnd. he had horrified Hangs by
throwing a kiss to them in the most
courtly style known t > the chivalry of
the Soul!) Cove. Happily his gesture
had 1.1 ii ,taken fora private signal
to th" !")•. and the incident had es
