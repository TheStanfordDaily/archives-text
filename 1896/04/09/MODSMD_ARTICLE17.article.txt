The Hastings.— it is a well
known fact that the most prom
inent clothing linn in San Fran
cisco is "1 he Hastings," southwest
corner of Montgomery and Sutter
streets. They have the reputation
of square dealing, low prices, and
first-class goods. Coods are just
as represented. They also make a
specialty of gentlemen's furnishing
goods. Our readers will do well by
patronizing "The Hastings."
The attention of the students and
our readers in general is called to
the advertisement of A. 0. Spald
ing & Bros, which we are carrying
in another column. Their spring
and summer line of baseball and
athletic supplies is unsurpassed,
their trade niarK legend '"Spalding
Highest Quality'' on their goods
being absolute guarantee that the
articles bearing it are the best that
can be produced. The managers of
track and baseball teams would do
well to secure estimates from this
linn before placing their spring
orders. A handsome catalogue will
be mailed free to any student send
ing his address.
