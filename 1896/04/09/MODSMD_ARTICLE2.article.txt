The Class of '96 held an impor
tant meeting in the chapel this
afternoon. The reports of the com
mittees on Commencement Week,
Senior Hop, Senior Farce, and Sen
ior Class-Hook were approved. The
Commencement Week Committee
gave an outline of the plans for
that week, and if well carried out,
they ensure the most successful
Commencement Week yet held at j
Stanford. The Farce Committee
reported that five farces had been I
submitted for the #25 prize offered,
and that a sub-committee of five
members, two from the faculty and
three from the class, had been ap
pointed to select the best farce
easily capable of production. The
Senior Class-Hook Committee gave
an outline of the work of the pro
jectors of the book and recom
mended that it receive the sanction
of the class.
Considerable discussion then fol-i
lowed as to whether the Commence-1
nient Week invitations should have J
the names of the members of the
class engraved on them. It was
decided that the invitation should i
be simple in design and consist of
a formal engraved announcement j
with an enclosed card bearing the j
program for the week. The quest
ion of whether the class should re
quest that itsdiplomas be engraved
then came up, and was referred to!
a committee of live to find out the j
expense necessary and the senti-;
nient of the class in regard to the
matter. An assessment of $4 was
levied to defray expenses of Com
mencement Week.
