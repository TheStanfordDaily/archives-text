# The 						German Student.
## 
### 
Prof. Kriehn lectured Tuesday
evening in substance as follows:
An American student going to
Germany need have no fears about
coming too late lor the beginning of
the semester. Everything is run
on the "gemiitlich" plan. Lectures
commence two weeks later than the
official beginning of the semester,
and end two weeks earlier than the
close. Professors make a. point of
giving the students their time-hon
ored "akademisches Yiertel," i. e.,
a quarter of an hour grace after
bell taps before beginning a lecture.
The German student comes to
the university well prepared from
the gymnasium or Realschule.
Entering the university he proceeds
with zest and avidity to enjoy his
much-cherished "akademische Frei
heit." He lives alone, fora comrade
or a boarding-house would fetter the
freedom of his movements. lie is
more independent in action than it
is possible for us t<> conceive. Un
fettered by social restraint, un
moved by popular opinion, he en
joys what is more valuable still,
complete freedom from care.
He has privileges of cheap entrance
to the theatre, opera, and concert,
lie is also treated very leniently
by the courts of law.
Brother Studio cares little for the
society of the Philistines. lint he
has an infinite number of societies
of his own. These may best be di
vided into two classes, "farbentra
gende" and "nichtfarbentragende."
The former always wear colors,and
on festive occasions don the pictur
esque student attire of olden times.
Their prime object is of course so
ciability, but also to promote honor
and knighthood among the stu
dents. They now number about
five per cent, of all the students.
Societies which do not bear col
ors exist for the purpose of promot
ing some science, art, or amusement,
iii addition to sociability. Such
are the "Turnvereine," singing so
cieties, the academical historical
society, and the like. There is no
ungentlemanly conduct in the
"Kneipe," and little intoxication.
The most charming thing about
these social evenings is the student
songs which they sing. Plaint
ive love ditties, stirring patri
otic anthems; the joyous song
of the wanderer on the march, the
sad lay of the exile from home.
There are songs of greeting and of
farewell to alma mater, and songs
in praise of the pleasures of stu
dent life.
One of the curious customs of
German students is that of settling
disputes by duel, with the "Schlii
ger," or rapier. All elements of
danger are removed by bandages
and spectacles; harmless scars are
the only result. To a foreigner
this practice seems very ridiculous.
If he can afford it the German
student never neglects his vacation
tour, which is usually made on
foot. His ideal devotion to
science carries him through the
dullest subjects. Of course lie is
absolutely free to study whatever
lie pleases.
The university is the great cru
cible through which all the profes
sional men of Germany must pass.
The university therefore wields
an incredible influence on German

life. Lt is as free as it is great;
even so powerful a state as Prussia
has been repeatedly worsted in con
flicts with the University of Berlin.
Prospective German students in
America should leave for Germany
as early in the summer vacation as
possible. Associate with German
students and live just as tliey do.
