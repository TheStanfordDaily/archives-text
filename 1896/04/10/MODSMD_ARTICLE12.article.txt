# Literary Meeting Saturday Night.
## 
### 
The second joint meeting of the
literary societies will be held in the
chapel, Saturday evening, April 11.
The discussion will concern the ad
visability of Congress appropriat
ing $100,000,000 for increasing the
navy and providing coast defenses.
As the future interest of the liter
ary work of the University depends
much upon the interest shown in
this experimental series of joint
meetings, it is earnestly requested
by those in charge that all the
members of the societies be present.
The public are cordially invited.
