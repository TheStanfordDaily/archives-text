of Chicago find that they are till
able to agree on a rule regarding
the "rushing" of freshmen. The
faculty forbids them to pledge fresh
men, hut the rule has not been lived
up to in all cases and the frater
nities, in order to protect, them
selves, decided to have a rule of
their own, but were unable to agree.
