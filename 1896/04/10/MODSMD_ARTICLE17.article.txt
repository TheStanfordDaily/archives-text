We might suggest to the Class
of ".Mi that its musicians and verse
makers have an opportunity of
leaving a valuable legacy to the
l T Diversity in the shape of one or
two characteristic student songs.
We have no humorous or convivial
songs which belong distinctively to
Stanford. "Hail, Stanford, Hail"
is a university anthem, not a stu
dent song, and the tune of '"The
Little Vendome" is not original.
What we need in this direction is
two or three songs breathing a
Stanford spirit both in words and
music.
