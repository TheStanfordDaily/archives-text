\Yk should congratulate our
selves on having passed the cap
and-govvn period of university life.
More than once attempts have been
made to revive the mortarboard
and to introduce the thing among
us, but each time good sense and
wisdom have prevailed. When the
present Junior Class was yet in the
swaddling clothes of its infancy,
the cap and gown were adopted as
class emblems; but within a week
this action was reconsidered; even
class caries, which were adopted,
have come to be generally dis
carded.
Our development is not along
that line. More and more we have
gravitated towards freedom and
simplicity, and away from the cus
toms and observances", that clus
tered about the training of a cen
tury ago. The mortar-board is
one of these pagan institutions; a
relic of the cloisters when education
meant a life of penance, privation,
and prayer. We of the West need
no such follies to mark us in our

university career. Ilow delicious
will be the sensation experienced
lÂ»v lite professors whom ue send to
Chicago during the coming sumnier
when they are obliged to address
the students clothed in the austere
ma jesty of tasselled cap and silken
gown!
