# Track and Field.
## 
### 
On Monday a training table for
the track men will be opened in
Eneina. Eleven of the most prom
ising candidates will be admitted
at once, two other probable Varsity
men preferring their present board
ing places. Three or four more
will be admitted in the week, and
a field-day will be held Monday or
Tuesday to determine what men
shall fill these places.
Brown, Toombs, Bernhard, Brun
ton, Jack, Dole, Reynolds, Frazier,
Roper, Kickert, and Wilbur will be
the chosen, while Johnson and
Hazzard will remain at their pres
ent boarding places. Of course
the other track candidates, either
Wootten or Holbrook, will get a
seat, which one depends on the
work they do in the field-day next
week. One of the green hurdlers
and a distance man and probably

a walker or a wheelman will com
plete the list. The athletes will oc
cupy the old football table next to
the window, and will enjoy a bill of
fare similar to that furnished to
our kickers of last fall.
