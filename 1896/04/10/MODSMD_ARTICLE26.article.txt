The Graduate Club meets tomor
row nielli at dinner at the Hotel
Metropole, Oakland. It'.- a good
thing, of course, to have a Gradu
ate Chili and to have it dine, hut
Ihe most interesting thing on the
table will undoubtedly be the dis
cussion. This will be on the wis
dom and expediency of reducing
the college course from four to
t hree yea rs, apropos of Ha rva rd's re
cent action in this direction. E. X.
Prouty and Miss M. I). Boynton
will lead.
Tomorrow the Associated Stu
dents meet. They will discuss the
Eastern trip, and especially Yale's
unwelcome backdown, which some
construe as an intention to ignore
California completely; many others
as asiLi,n of cowardice; each con
struction is unfortunate for both
Yale and us. There will also be
brought up in the meeting the idea
of presenting the big 'TV to the
basket-ball team, as being entitled
to wear them the same as the foot
hall and other teams. There is
some curiosity as to how the young
ladies will take this plan. Miss
Millicent \V. Shim , 'U7. by the
way, appears tomorrow with an
article accounting for the defeat of
t he California girls.
A dance gotten up by town peo
ple, and always referred to in the

Professor Setchell is reported to
have under way a new work on
botany. Everyone is pleased that
(ioveruor Budd will preside at the

Wheeler's being laid up. ('. Els
ton will probably catch in his
stead. Each fraternity is to be
asked to donate a sweater to the
team, which is very "hard up."
Sat urdav t he spring tield-day comes
off. Entries are numerous and
records ought to go.
