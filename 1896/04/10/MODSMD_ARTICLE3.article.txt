# Archery Practice Revived.
## 
### 
There is being shown a good
deal of enthusiasm in archery. The
range has been cleared and a new
backstop has been put up, for which
burlaps and straw were given by
Mr. Sherman and Mr. Stanhope of
Palo Alto. Through the energy of
Miss Stebbins, Miss Minor, and
Miss Keifer the backstop was com
pleted.
The various classes in the gym
nasium are practicing, and so much
interest is shown that several plan
to purchase bows and arrows for
themselves, although the Women's
Athletic Club has its own.
It might be well to correct the
mistaken idea that many have in
regard to the Women's Athletic
Club, which is open to all the
women of the University, whether
they are taking gymnasium work
or not. The dues are twenty-five
cents per semester, and no assess
ments. Membership admits to all
branches of the club.
