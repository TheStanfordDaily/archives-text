# Stanford at Berkeley.
## 
### 
The Stanford nine leaves tomor
row to play with Reliance on the
Berkeley diamond. The team
against which they will he pitted
is considered a very strong aggre
gation. They have defeated Berke
ley hy a score of 8 to 2, and the
showing our team makes against
them will he a good basis from
which to make an estimate of our
nine. Bert Oliver pitches for the
Reliance team. Stanford plays
this game at Berkeley in order to
become familiar with the U. C.
field before the intercollegiate
matches.
Berkeley will play a game here
with Santa Clara College a week
from tomorrow for the same pur
pose.
Owing to the rains the Varsity
nine has not had its regular prac
tice for several days, but all of the
men have fair form and are play
ing a game that should win a vic
tory for the cardinal.
The Stanford nine will play as
follows: .Jeffs c, McLaine p, Taylor
ss, Young lh, Harris 2b, Sharp 81),
Stansbery If, Freeman cf, Thomp
son rf. One substitute will be
taken.
