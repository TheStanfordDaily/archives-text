BEFORE LONG
All who ride the bicycle will be wearing
the Deimel Linen-Mesh Underwear.
Those who do now are enthusiastic in
praising it.
People wlio exercise lnncli, sncli as
wlieehnen, ball players and lovers of
other kinds of athletic sport, ought to
appreciate the invaluable advantages of
our Linen-Mesh Underwear, winch ab
sorbs the perspiration and dries quickly,
hence feels warm and comfortable dur
ing exercise and after; which neither
overheats the body while exercising, nor
chills it when at rest, and which never
clings to the body like tt wet woolen or
cotton garment. These facts speak for
themselves.
Mr. Lewis Herreshoff of Defender
fame, has this to say: "1 think the
Deitnel Linen-Mesh should be worn by
all who ride the bicycle; you should lay
far more stress on that."
