The Varsity nine easily defeated
the Reliance baseball team on the
Berkeley campus Saturday after
noon. This was the first oppor
tunity given for the U. C. to size
up our team, and a large number
of people filled the grandstand and
bleachers. The game was one-sided
throughout, the score being 19â€”5.
Stanford. made four runs in the
first inning. Stanford's batting
was good, our men having no dif
ficulty in hitting either Oliver or
Campbell. Jeffs knocked a three
bagger at one period of the game
when three men were on bases.
When the fact that the Reliance
team defeated Berkeley 7-2 is con
sidered, the conclusion is obvious,
yet the team needs to be improved
in several respects before we may
lie confident of victory.
The Reliance players were Camp
bell, pitcher and first base; Lanyon,
catcher; Oliver, first base and
pitcher; -J. Campbell, second base;
Walton, third base; Arlitt, short
stop; Dyer, left field; Ireland, cen
ter field; Ewing, light field. The
Stanford players were McLaine,
pitcher; Jeffs, catcher; Young, first
base; Harris, second base; Sharp,
third base; Taylor,shortstop; Stans
bery, left field; Strohn, center field;
Thompson, right field. Sheehan,
Stanford '95, was umpire.
