The tendency of modern univer
sity life to develop the activities of
students along all desirable lines
has lately received a strong
impulse forward in the ac
tion of several universities in giv
ing credit for work done on college
publications. It is noticeable too
that other branches of student ac
tivity are receiving substantial rec
ognition. In some colleges the
movement has extended to giving
credit for orchestral work, inde
pendent of the department of
music. Hand work has long
been recognized, two hours' credit
being allotted to it in our own Uni
versity when the department of
military science was in existence.
It is a surprising fact, however,
that other organizations much more
efficient in every way than either a
band or an orchestra have never re
ceived substantial support from the
hands of any faculty, and were
it proposed to give credit for
work done in them, the prop
osition would doubtless be re
ceived as absurd. Glee and man
dolin clubs are organizations of
such a class. It is doubtful if any
college hand or orchestra ever ac
complished one half of the good,
either to the individual or to the

university, that these clubs accom
plish, and yet tlie band and the or
chestra receive more recognition, if
not by the students, certainly by
the faculties of our American uni
versities. We would not maintain
that university credit should be
given for work on these clubs, but
it is only fair that some considera
tion be extended to those who rep
resent the University on the trips
taken by the Glee and Mandolin
Clubs. The work in these clubs ex
tends throughout the entire college
year, and the time and attention
required of each member in order
that tbe clubs may represent the
University in a creditable manner
is probably greater than that re
quired in any other University or
ganization.
