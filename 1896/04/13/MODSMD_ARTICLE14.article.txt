"No, 1 never did," he replied. ''You're
wonder, that's what you are. 1 said
so the first time ! ever saw you."
Florence went home and wrote a
sweet little, note. She sent it by a
1 rusty messenger, aged ten, whose se
ereey could be purchased with candy of
an inferior grade. Lawrence received
the note indue course, and he read as
follows:
• I was wrong when we quarreled. I
have regretted it ever since. But you
were not yourself that evening. Doubt
less your studies were worrying you. I
.should have made allowances. To-day
i have seen your true self, and I admire
you."
The words "true self" were under
lined once and "admire," three times.
"She admires I'addy O'Toole," mut
tered Lawrence with a groan. "1 sup
pose she thinks lie's a'wonder,'as my
brother says. Well, he is a wonder,
lie is the only one of his kind ever born
without a caudal appendage. lie is an

anthropoid. And Florence admires
him."
Lawrence buried his face in his hands
and ground his teetli with rage.

"Larry," said his brother one morn
ing, "we'll have to <lo something' for
you. You're falling behind."
"Falling behind whom?" asked Law
rence.
"The other half of you; the half that
is good for something."
"You mean Patrick."
"Of course."

Lawrence struggled to be calm.
"Granting for the .sake of argument,"
he said at last, "that it is possible to
be inferior to such a creature, I will
ask you in what respect you think me
to be deficient."
"Why, you're out of condition. You
look overtrained. You're ten pounds
under weight, and it shows in your face.
You're pale as a ghost, my boy."
"I fear," said Lawrence, thoughtful
ly, "that there is some truth in what
\'<>u say. The difference in our ways of
life lias done much to decrease that un
fortunate resemblance which—"
"Unfortunate." echoed his brother.
*'lt was the greatest piece of luck that
ever happened to Yale. What do you
think of the Harvard game?"
"I am trying not to think of it at
all." sighed Lawrence.
"Well. 1 tell you it's worth thinking
about. The Harvard team was made
up of nine sluggers from SI uptown,
and if anybody but Paddy had been in
the box they'd have batted the ball ail
over the state of Connecticut. You
ought to be proud of that game, Larry,
it was a big thing for Yale, and it
couldn't have been done without you.
Now, we can't take any risks. At any
cost of money or comfort we must pre
serve your resmblanee to Faddy. I've
thought that all out, and I'll tell you
vhat you must do.'*
