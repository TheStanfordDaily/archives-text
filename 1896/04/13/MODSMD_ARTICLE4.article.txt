"Cathode Radiation" is a name
given by Goldstein to one of the
forms of electric discharge through
very rare gases. If a spark be al
lowed to pass between metal balls
or points in the receiver of an air
pump while the air is being ex
hausted, the spark will cease when
the pressure of the air has been de
creased to about one fifth of an
atmosphere, and a glow or ''brush"
of light will be seen about the posi
tive pole. As the pressure is still
further decreased, the How spreads
out toward the negative pole, and
when the pressure has fallen to
about one two-hundreth of an at
mosphere it may fill nearly the
whole tube. This is the "positive
light." In air it is of a reddish
orange color. At the same time a
bluish light is seen about the nega
tive pole. The negative pole is
called the cathode, and this bluish
light is called the "cathode flow."
When the pressure has been de
creased to about one four-thous
andth of an atmosphere the posi
tive light will occupy a much
smaller space about the positive
pole (the anode), and the cathode
glow will have almost disappeared.
The cathode will be seen surrounded
by a dark space, called the cathode
space. Through this a beam of
pale blue light, much paler than
the cathode glow, will be seen go
ing off perpendicular to the cathode
surface. This beam is made up of
the so-called cathode rays. It goes
clear across the receiver, and im
pinges upon the anode or the glass
walls.
In every respect these cathode
rays act like particles of electrified
matter. They produce mechanical
effects and heat effects like particles
of matter projected with a great
velocity. They are deflected by a
magnet, like electrified particles.
They produce fluorescent effects
upon the glass walls of the receiver.
If the cathode is made of any metal
but aluminum the interior surface
of'the receiver where the rays strike
becomes plated with the metal of
the cathode. Evidently the cathode
is volatilized by the discharge, and
its particles are projected off with
great velocity.
The Roentgen X-rays were at
first supposed to be the cathode
rays which had passed through the
walls of the tube. They were ob
served by Hertz in 1891. They
were further investigated, and their
photographic properties discovered
by Lenard in 1893. Roth Hertz
and Lenard believed them to be
cathode rays which had passed
through the tube. Roentgen be
lieved them to be set up in the
glass by the impact of the cathode
rays. Their nature is not yet un
derstood. They are not cathode
rays. They may come from the
anode, while the cathode are being
discharged in another direction.
They are stronger from the anode
when the cathode rays discharge
upon it. They may come from a
condition in the receiver which is
neither anode or cathode, if it is
placed in the path of the discharge
of the anode and cathode. They
now seem to be the same rays with
which photographs have been taken
in our laboratory for nearly four
years. If so, the first photographs

were made with them here at least
a year earlier than elsewhere.
