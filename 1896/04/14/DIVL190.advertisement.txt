BEFORE IjONG
All who ride the bicycle will be wearing
the Deiuiel Linen-Mesh Underwear.
Those who do now are enthusiastic in
praising it.
People who exercise much, sucli ;ih
wheelmen, hall players and lovers of
other kinds of athletic spurt, ought to
appreciate the invaluable advantages of
our Linen-Mesh Underwear, which ab
sorbs the perspiration and dries <|uicklv,
hence feels warm and comfortable dur
ing exercise and after; which neither
overheats the body while exercising, nor
! chills it when at rest, and w hich never
clings to the body like a wet woolen or
1 cotton garment. These facts speak for
themselves.
Mr. Lewis Herreshoff of Defender
fame, lias this to say: "I think the
Deimel Linen-Mesh should be worn bv
all who ride the bicycle; you should lay
far more stress on that."
For sale at the store of
THE DEIMEL LINEN-MESH
SYSTEM COMPANY,

Opposite Occidental Hotel.
