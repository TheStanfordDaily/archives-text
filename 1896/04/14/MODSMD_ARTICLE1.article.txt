## Two Successful Presentations of the Comic Opera "Said Pasha" by University Talent. 
### 
The sen ting capacity of Encina
gymnasium was taxed to its utmost
on Friday and Saturday evenings
to accommodate the large crowds
gathered to witness the niuch
talkcd-of presentation of the comic
opera ".Said Pasha" !<)• University
talent. Every one wore a load of
pleasurable anticipation, and it is
safe to say that not one went away
without having his anticipations in
a large degree realized.
The opera, a difficult one in it
self and the most elaborate and
most extensive entertainment yet
attempted by local management,
was successful beyond expectations.
The costumes worn, the scenery
presented, and the pretty groupings
of the players beyond formed a
most striking and attractive scene
and was one of the noteworthy fea
tures of the evening.
The costumes and scenery were
'brought direct from the Tivoli
Opera House in San Francisco and
were truly magnificent. There
were a number of breaks and delays
that occurred, particularly on the
first night, which marred somewhat
the pleasure of the evening, but on
the whole every thing went off
as smoothly as could be expected.
The most annoying delay was that
occasioned by the shifting of scen
ery during the intermission of the
lirst and second acts. In fact all
the '"waits" between acts were en
tirely too long. This defect can
doubtless be ascribed to the lack of
facility for handling the scenery.
The audience, however, was good
natured and was well entertained
during the long waits by the antics
and "guving" of the crowd on the
bleachers. On the second night
the performance was characterized
by more promptitude and went off
much more smoothly and rapidly
than on the previous night.
The general acting and singing
of the play was excellent. Perhaps
the most noticeable feature was the
work of the men's and ladies'
choruses, the singing of the latter
being especially good. Individu
ally all acquitted themselves with
credit, although the singing was at
times completely drowned by the
over enthusiastic accompaniment of
the orchestra. There seemed to be
a general complaint on that score,
but it is probable that the miserable
acoustic properties of the building
had much to do with the result.
Among those who deserve especial
mention for their work are 1\ F.
Abbott and Miss McMillan who, as
Hassen Bey and Serena respect
ively, in their dual role of lover
and loved, had a most difficult
part to perform and did it with
much credit to themselves; their
singing and acting were very good.
(i. P. Baldwin and Chas. Dillon,
who took the parts of Iladad and
Nockey respectively, made the hit
of the evening bv their clever act
ing; the ability they displayed in
their parts was remarkable and
their witty sallies and local hits
fairly captured the audience. Miss
Mann, who was Alti, made a lovely
and bewitching queen, and Miss
Farrel, as Balah Sojah, acted her
part with all the skill of a pro

fessional and received her just
share of praise and commendation.
Miss Farrel posses a voice that ap
parently has been very carefully
cultivated and shows by her
actions that she is not an entire
stranger to the stage. G. \V.
Bush, as Said Pasha, carried out
his role with considerable ability.
W. A. Sutherlalid, as Terano, sang
well. I lis part was a most dif
licult one to assume, being that of
a dreamy ideal wife-hunter dur
ing the first two acts and a fiery
Mexican gentleman in the last.
His work was admirable. W. .J.
Schlacks assumed the difficult role
of Rajah with acceptable cleverness.
The cast of those who took part
in the play was as follows:

The opera was planned and
played under the sole supervision
of 11. I). Connick, '97, who deserves
great credit for the success of the
affair, as indeed do all who took
part in it. This is the second suc
cessful opera Mr. Connick has pre
sented at the University, and shows
that he has unusual ability for the
management of such an affair.
The tot a I receipts of the entertain
ment were about $4~>o, and after ex
penses are deducted the proceeds
will he divided between the student
body and the management of the
'97 Annual.
