## 
### 
Hon. Samuel T. Black, State Su
perintendent of l'ublie Instruction,
addressed an audience in the
chapel this afternoon on the sub
ject "The California school system."
lie gave an outline of the school

law and government of this Slate,
in some respects commending and
in others criticising it.
Special attention was given to
the faulty way of granting certifi
cates to teachers in the State, and
to the fault in the State Constitu
tion where it makes specific pro
visions in regard to school matters.
Mr. Black said that the constitu
tion should he general, and the
specific rules be made by the legis
lature or other wieldy body.
The method of organization of
the State Hoard of Education was
shown to be very strong and was
highly commended.
