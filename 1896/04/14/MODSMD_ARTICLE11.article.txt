						Revelation of the Romantic and Remarkable Career of Lawrence Bangs, the Famous Yale Athlete.

Copvrtrht,

lie proceeded to outline his plan. In ,
..e first place Lawrence was to study : i> j
future on the roof of the. house during |
the day time.
4 I've found a nice hot corner lip there j
for yon," said Uarr.v. "You'll have :i i
southern exposure and a chimney In*- '
hind you that gets pretty warm, i K- i
lieve. in the middle <»112 the day-when t! j
sun's on it. Xolmxlv can see y<»n rj>
there and you win lay 011 all tin- color |
you need."

"Then you must take a lot of exer
eise," continued Harry. "I*addy is iili
ing out a good deal, and you'll have to I
keep up with him."
"Hut my dear brother," Lawrence

•eplied, "I can't fiml time fur <111 this.
T.ie. over-indulgence in physical exer
«1 r» which you recommend will en
croach upon my hours of i.ludy."'
•Can't, you study ami ex< r-.-ist at the
same time? <iet some light dumb
•oils and swing them while you're
grinding 1 Greek. Then you w« n't Ijc
casting your time altogether with the
blasted stuff. And. besides, you may
develop. There's no telling. If you
were a little heavier you'd be an ideal
man for football."
Lawrence brightened at this last re
mark and Harry took it for a hopeful
tdgn.
•'By Jove," he cried, "it would be a
great thing if 1 could get both of you
into shape for the game. We could
play it on Harvard in great shape.
We'd have one of you half killed in
practice just before the Harvard game.
I'robably it would have to l>e you, be
cause Paddy woul.l be the better ma.ri.
Then I'd put you in the If nitrl :;ttt let

every body know that yon were there.
We'd have reliable doctor's certificates
to .show that yon couldn't possibly
play again during the season. There"d
be a jubilee in Cambridge and
Harvard inonev would come out
at odds on. Then, at tlie last minute.
I'd get you out of the hospital and hide
you. and ruddy could go into the game.
All Harvard would walk back fr;>ni
Springfield and Yale would have money
to burn after the game. It would beat
the trick we played the first year 1
rowed on the crew. We got an artist
to paint boils on the backs of our
'.seeks, and the papers came out with a
story that we had been poisoned. The
odds on Harvard jumped to three to one:
and then we won the race by about a
quarter of a mile. Asa matter of fact
they hadn't been in it from the first of
May to the day of the race."
Lawrence faithfully observed his
brother's directions. He had noticed
that out.loor life and exercise were im
proving Paddy's appearance, and he
had Florence's word that the Irish
man was the better looking of the two.
It must 1101 be supposed that he was un
affected by this criticism or that he was
so much wrapped up in his studies as to
be c litvly oblivi ms to the considera
tion of his personal appearance, lie
deci Vd that a little color in the cheeks
word i improve him, and so he mounted
to the roof the next day with the antic
ipation of securing great benefit. It
was very hot in the; corner which Harry
had m leeted for him, but Law rence
stuck io it all day with the exception
of hi-, hours of recitation. IJy evening
his fact; was burned to a blister, and he
had t > remain in the house two or
three days until the color moderated to
a shade which matched Paddy's.
