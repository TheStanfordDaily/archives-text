# SPIRITUAL PERSPECTIVE.
## A
						Sermon by Professor Edward Howard Griggs. 
### 
The meaning of any fact of
] science is determined by the point
jof view from which it isseen. The
fact that an apple falls to the ground
I is a small thing, but when it is seen
I in relation to the movements of the
stars it reveals the law of gravita
tion. W hen we see the struggle of
j a man like Giordano Bruno in the
| light of the forward progress of the
| race toward freedom, his life is full
of meaning. Thus the wisdom of
j life consists largely in seeing things
Jin true perspective. Ignorance and
! error are distorted vision.
Time and space sift out inequal
| ities and give us this perspective.
J It is only the large positive tend-
I encies of history which are evident.
| How easy it is for us to see in their
j large outlines the great movements
| of history, like the rise and spread
|of Christianity. It is almost itn
i possible to justly estimate the pres
j ent. We lack utterly the perspec
! tive of time and space. We give an
adventitious value to modern points
of view, forgetting that the value
of modern thought can never be
understood unless we see it in its
historical relations. Hence the re
action of men like Rousseau and
Carpenter. They sec the evils of
the present and the noble meaning
of the past, and believe the solution
of social problems lies in a return
to primitive conditions. Rousseau
and Carpenter have profound les
sons to teach us; but their theory
that civilization is a disease and
savagery the ideal condition of hu
man life, is a simple result of the
difference in the perspective in
which present and past times are
seen.
We are met by the same prob
lem in all spheres of personal life.
We fail to see the opportunity and
responsibility of present life. We
do not see that life always has
been made up of commonplace
j things, and yet that at heart it is
always great. Herein is greatness,
that one be able to see the divinity
of common things, to recognize the
nobility of daily life while it is with
us, and before the opportunities
i have slipped from our reach.
Hence the great need is to correct
I this error in our view of things
! about us: to secure a perspective of
I the soul in place of the wanting
| perspective of time and space. To
I this end we must strive to attain
I more of that serenity of soul which
I can lift us above the submerging
j stream of things. Our constant
i activity is of priceless value, but it
is too hasty and unconsidered.
The ideal activity is like the mo
tion of the stars —so harmonious
that it seems like rest.
To attain this serene poise of life,
solitude and meditation are neces
sary. Too much contact with
others distracts and weakens us.
Ideal society is possible only
between two; and in friendship we
have two of the greatest forces in
lifting us to this quiet vision of life.
Even when we are deprived of the
society of our friend we know that
|he is there, and when we turn to
him again we shall be sure to find
the strength and rest that comes
from meeting a frank sincere per
sonality.

There is one friend we may have
for the choosing —the great wise
nature-mother, who knows how to
speak when we would he charmed
with the music of her myriad
voices, and who can he silent when
her child is wearied and would rest.
The appreciation of beauty is
simply the conscious recognition of
the harmony between nature and
human sensibilities, which is one re
sult of the long process of life. We
need the perspective of the spirit to
see this world of beauty.
It is the chief value of all art
that it can aid in uplifting us to
this serenity of soul. The best
thing in Spinoza, Kant, or Plato is
the wide vision from the mountain
height of thought which makes lift'
lie clearer before us. If to this se
renity we can add something of
that noble courtesy in the personal
relations of life, we shall come very
near the true spiritual perspective.
It is the significance of this courtesy
that it lends a spiritual atmos
phere to the bare, hard realities of
1 i fe.
Spiritual perspective means then
the wise, calm vision of things
which lie close to us. It means
living in time but in the presence
of eternitv.
