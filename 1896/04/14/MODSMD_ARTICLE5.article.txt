# To See U.C. Play Ball.
## 
### 
The U. C. varsity baseball team
will play the team of Santa Claru
College on our campus Saturday
afternoon at 2:80 pin. An admis
sion fee of twenty-five cents will be
charged, as the expenses of the
visiting teams must be defrayed by
lis. The remainder of the proceeds,
if any, will go to the student body.
This will be the first opportunity
for Stanford to size up the rival
team before the intercollegiate
matches, of which the first will be
played on April '2'2 at Berkeley.
The game will be interesting and
should be largely attended.
