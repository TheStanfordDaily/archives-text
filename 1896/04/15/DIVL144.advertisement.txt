All \vl>o ride the bicycle will be wearing
the Deiniel Linen-Mesh Underwear.
Those who do now are enthusiastic in
praising it.
People who exercise much, such as
wheelmen, ball players and lovers of
other kinds of athletic sjnjrt, ought to
appreciate the invaluable advantages of
our Linen-Mesh Underwear, which ab
sorbs the perspiration and dries quickly,
hence feels warm and comfortable dur
ing exercise and after; which neither
overheat8 the body while exercising, nor
chills it when at rest, and which never
clings to the body like a wet woolen or
cotton garment. These facts speak for
themselves.
Mr. Lewis Herreshoff of Defender
fame, has this to say: "I think the
Deiniel Linen-Mesh should be worn by
| all who ride the bicycle; you should lay
j far more stress on that."
