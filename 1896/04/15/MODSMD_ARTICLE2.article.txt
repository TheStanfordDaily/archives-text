The following briefs for the
Thursday debate in Forensics are
printed by request.
"Neither equity vor the encourage
ment of invention require* the grunt
ing of a complete monopoly' to every
patentee. The government .should
have the right at the time of granting
a patent to purchase it for, nay,
$100,000, if it appears to he worth
so much to the community; the thing
patented then to he open to free com
petitive manufachive."
Affirmative.
{Ahe and Dyke.)
INTRODUCTION.
I. Original thought sufficient to
produce a valuable invention to
society should be rewarded.
11. There are at least two meth
ods of rewarding inventions:
1. By allowing the government
to pay the inventors liberal sums
at the time of patenting and allow
ing free competitive manufacture.
2. Ky granting them patents for
terms of years by which they re
ceive the benefits accruing from
monopolies on the manufacture and
sale of these patented articles.
111. We maintain:
1. That neither equity, i.e., jus

tice toward the inventor, nor the
encouragement of invention re-i
quires that an absolute monopoly I
I»t' granted in all rases; lint
2. That the government should
have the right to purchase at the
time of patenting any invention
considered sufficiently valuable to
society, the thing patented to lie
open to free competitive manufac
ture.
BltlEF PltOPEH.
I. lvjuity does not demand an
absolute monopoly to patentees in
all cases; for,
1. ''All intellectual effort is an
historical product."—Ely: Out
linen of Economics, p. 2U5. Illus
trations: the telephone; the tele
graphy.
2. It often happens that several
individuals simultaneously and in
dependently make the same dis
covery and invention.
3. The inventor under the pres
ent system is seldom the patentee;
for,
a. The manufacturing firm be
comes the patentee of inventions
made by the mechanics, because
the firm demands the products of
its mechanics' labor.
b. Manufacturing firms by crafty
machinations or by purchasing the
invention prevent the inventor
from becoming the patentee.
II. The encouragement of inven
tion does not demand absolute mo
nopoly to the patentee in all cases;
for,
1. Our patent system does not
insure the advantages accruing
from monopolies to inventors; for,
a. The average inventor who re
ceives a patent is compelled to sell
it below its value to a manufactur
ing firm which receives the advan
tages of the monopoly.
2. The liberal sum of, say $100,-
000, from the government is more
than the inventor, who gets any
patent, is liable to receive.
3. A certainty is more liable o
stimulate invention than an un
certainty.
III. The government should have
the right to purchase at the time of
patenting any invention considered
to be worth -$100,000 to the com
munity, said patent to be open to
free competitive manufacture; for,
1. Monopoly manufacture is con
ducive to the accumulation of
large fortunes at the expense of
society; for,
a. Society p;iys for patented
articles not.only the cost a nd legiti
mate profit, but as large a royalty
as the trade will warrant.
CONCLUSION.
It has been shown:
1. That equity and encourage
ment of inventions do not demand
absolute monopoly to patentees in
all cases.
2. That reward to patentees by
the government is more economical
to society than by monopoly.
3. That economically small im
provements and inventions will
receive a sufficient reward under a
system similar to the present.
a. The proposition is maintained.
Negative.

INTRODUCTION.
I. History.
1. First patent ever granted in

America given by the General
Court of Massachusetts, May (5,
1045. This was granted:
a. Under the system of law
called the Body of Liberty.
h. Given to Joseph Jenckes of
Lynn fora scythe.
c. Jenckes prayed for "protection
for fourteen years without disturb
ance by any other setting up the
invention so that his study or cost
might not be in vain or lost."
2. First patent law passed by
the United States government
April 10, 1790. Three patents the
first year; fifty-five the lirst three
years.
3. The patent laws have fostered
inventions in our country so that
the fifty-five patents granted dur
ing the first three years that we
had such laws have grown to over
20,000 yearly and are increasing
all the time, there being some
43,000 applications iiled each year.
After a careful consideration of
this history we maintain:
11. That equity and the en
couragement of inventions require
a complete monopoly to be given to
every patentee fora certain time,
and that it would not be advisable
for the government to have the
right to purchase patents.
BRIEF PROPER.
1. Equity of patents.
I. If there be any equity in
property rights of any kind, the
very principles of equity itself de
mand the protection afforded by
patent laws.
a. The man who brings some
thing out of nothing has rights
therein which can not belong to
any other sort of property.
11. Encouragement of invention
requires the protection afforded by
patent laws, and would not be sub
served by the plan proposed by the
affirmative.
1. The capitalist as necessary as
the inventor.
2. Many inventions require
great expense in perfecting.
3. The introduction of new
articles requires large capital.
4. People will not undertake the
introduction of new articles without
the protection of a patent.
111. Advisability of the govern
ment having the option of purchase.
We contend that this would not be
an improvement on the present
plan.
1. Because of the impossibility
of correctly estimating the value of
inventions before they have been
tested.
2. Because of the too great
chance for favoritism. The in
ventor who had the heaviest pull
on the officials would be the one
who would get the bonus, regard
less of the value of the device.
3. Poor men would lose the in
centive which our present law gives
them.
4. There is scarcely today any
such thing as free competitive
manufacture in the United States.
The added cost of the bonus would
have to be paid by the people in
form of additional taxes, while the
cost of the articles themselves
would not be made any less.
5. All appropriations for money
must come from the House of Rep
resentatives, and the personnel of
that body is not such as to war

rant the conclusion that it would
use this power wisely in the way
of paying for inventions.
CONCLUSION.
I. No century in the history of
the world has seen such wonderful
progress made as has the 19th cen
tury. This progress has been due
to our patent law as much as to
any other one thing.
II. Equity demands that intel
lectual property should have pro
tection.
III. Encouragement of inven
tions requires the same protection.
IV. Now patents cost the gov
ernment nothing, as the patent of
fice is more than self-supporting.
V. Government purchase would
entail vast expense, and must be
unjust.
VI. While our present law might
be improved in its workings in
many ways, and we would earnestly
advocate such improvement,yet we
maintain that we have proved that
it should not he abolished for the
sake of trying a chimerical experi
ment.
VII. The best interests of the
public require the protection and
encouragement of patents afforded
by our law.
