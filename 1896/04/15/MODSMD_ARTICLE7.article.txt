Among the institution* at â–ºStan
ford deserving the careful consider
ation of students, the Co-operative
Association is by no means least.
A university co-operative store
gives students an advantage in the
purchase of supplies which, while
very considerable, is but poorly ap
preciated. To meet with any de
gree of success, however, in saving
money for its patrons, a store of
this kind must be truly co-opera
tive. No one person, nor a score of
persons, can make it a success; but
the co-operation of all is necessary.
A few remarks in regard to possible
improvements in our own system
may not be out of place at this
time, and if they result in turning
a little more attention to the need
of co-operation, their purpose will
lie attained.
It is sometimes impossible for
professors to know how many
books will be needed in a certain
course. This is especially true at
the beginning of a semester. But
after a class has once been organ
ized there is no reason why the
number of 'nooks ordered should
not coincide exactly with the de
mand for them. One of our pro
fessors has adopted a plan that is
very commendable. He announces
the book to be used next in his
class. A paper is then passed for
those to sign who want copies of
the book. The paper containing
signatures is handed to the mana
ger of the Co-op. When the books
arrive the names are checked off as
fast as the books are taken away
by those who ordered them. In
this way no one who wants a book
is left without it, there is no delay,
and no dead stock is left on the
shelves at the Co-op.
Every one should remember that
all dead stock accumulated means
just so much added to the price of
books sold. W hen this is realized
it will be seen how important the
matter is to every one who buys
books or stationery.
