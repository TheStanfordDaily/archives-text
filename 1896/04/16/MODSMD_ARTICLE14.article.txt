The present year will witness the
publication of several important
works by members of our faculty
on subjects connected with their
various departments of work. It is
gratifying to friends of the Univer
sity to kiiow that Stanford is tak
ing her place among the older uni
versities in the production of sci
entific literature. In the present
day the standing of a college is
largely determined by the ability
of its professors, as shown in the
production of valuable additions to
the sum of knowledge. From pres
ent indications we need have little
fear that Stanford is not going to
take a foremost place as a book
producing cent re.
