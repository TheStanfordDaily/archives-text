I'hok. (Jot.mvis Smith, the 11ist<Â»-
lian, is doubtful whether the new
Olympic; games inaugurated this
year ;it Alliens will prove a lasting
success. In an article in AtJilctic
Life I'rof. Smith snys that the
movement is the outcome of two
things, the craze tor everything
(ircek, and the renewed love of
hodily culture which has finally
abolished the ascetic ideals of the
Middle Ages. Hut the racial inter
est which was the life of the games
can never, in I'rof. Smith's opinion,
he revived. The modern gather

ings will lie nothing but a motley
assembly of people from ;ill lands,
i which will hear no resemblance to
j (Jreeks of the time of I'indar. The
J(1 reek* people, says Prof. Smith.
| will not be likely to take any real
j interest in the games, and on the
| whole it is extremely doubtful if
the institution can be made sue-
I
jeessfnl in its modern setting.

There is no reason why the defi
nite article should be used before
the name of Stanford University.
Nevertheless, its use is very general.
University publications commonly
speak of "the Lelaud Stanford .Jun
ior University," and the offensive
article is seen on the names of
books written by Stanford profes
j sors. Why should we say ''the Le
laud Stanford Junior University"
any more than "the Harvard Uni
versity" or ''the Cornell Univer
! sitv" or "the .Johns Hopkins Uni
i j
I versity"? Such a use of the article
before the names of those institu
; lions would be extremely offen
sive to their adherents. Ii seems
j strange that its use here does not
i seem in just as had taste, but judg
j ing from its prevalence with those
j whom we would least expect to
j make such a blunder, there are
j many whom it does not strike as
being out of place. True, the usage
! is sanctioned by the charter of the
I University, but it is none the less
unfortunate and should be dropped*.
