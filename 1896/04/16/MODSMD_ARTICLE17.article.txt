# Old Eli's Favorite Son.
## A 						Revelation of the Romantic and Remarkable Career of Lawrence Bangs, the Famous Yale Athlete. 
### HOWARD FIELDING 
Copvrlfht. 1804.

W hen the article appeared the ab
sence of all reference to educational
subjects was the most conspicuous
tliiny about it —to Lawrence, lint it is
safe to say that nobody rise noticed it.
The reporter was a very polite young
man. and did not wish to offend any
body who would be good for so much
space in the future as Larry Bangs
would. So he wrote a nice note to the
subject of the interview, explaining
that he had faithfully recorded all that
Lawrence had said, but, unhappily,
"space" was short in that particular
Sunday's paper, and so the educational
matters, as being of less interest to the
public, were crowded out.
Lawrence had a considerable respect
for the profession of journalism, which
he had some thought of entering after
iiis college course was over, lie did
not intend to reform it. On the con
trary he thought it quite good enough
as it was to engage his most serious ef
forts. lie was not nearly so much in
clined to question the judgment of the
editor who had omitted the educational
part of his interview, as one acquainted
with his studious disposition might
have expected that he would be. (>11
the contrary lie was led to wonder
whether education had notceased to be
of any importance in the world. Evi
dently that was the view of the editor,
an<J such a man should be in touch with
public sentiment. The experiences of
iiis first year at college had naturally
prepared him to take such a view,
therefore on the occasion of the sec
ond reporter's visit lie devoted all Lis
tiiii" to a serious discussion of lmseba II
and its probable effect 011 the destiny
of mankind, interspersed —at the re
porter's request—with stories ■ trat
ing the most advanced ineth'xis of bull
dozing ;:n umpire as that science was
taught at Vale.
The whole of this interview was
printed. Most of it was unintelligible
to l'addy. but such parts as lie under
stood- 1 > use his Dwn expression—
"gave him a poin."
"It's no 11:..e, Larry," be said, "you
haven't got the head for it. - '
And Lawrence was inclined to agree
with him in secret, though openly he
afrcctcd to despite advice from such a
quarter.
"Is it possible " he said to himself
afterwards, "that 111 regard to certain
important, branches of human knowl
edge I am what Patrick would call
't hick.' "
CIIAJ'TKU IX.
A n.OT AGAINST T1IK ITNIVKK8ITY.
Lawrence liangs had been reading
from the works of Quintns lloratins
Flaceus, a gentleman for whom lie en
tertained, in his customary state of
mind, the IJIO ,t cordial sentiments. On
this occasion, however, he laid down
the monument more lasting than brass,
and scowied at it in a dark and menac
ing fashion.
It was eleven o'clock, and that was a'
very early hour for Lawrence to cease
studying; but he had less appetite for
study 011 this night than any other that
he could remember. The truth is that

he ha;l reached a crisis which usually
comes much later in the college
life of a thoughtful man, that period,
to put it plainly, when he first
realizes that he does not know as
much as a cow. The information of a
cow, regarding that sphere of life to
which she is called, is apparently ex
haustive. and eminently satisfactory to
herself. Shi; has learned to chew the
cud. an operation which yields greater
contentment with less visible result,
than anything else in the world. To
the col lege professor is often granted
an almost identical blessing, but it is
different with the student. lie will
certainly feel, now and then, a desire
to do more than chew the cud; lie will
wish to swallow it. In other words,
he will desire to make an end of some
thing. not merely by laying it aside,
but by getting the whole of it. And
he can't do it, in his line of life. Not
one educated man in a thousand
really knows very much about the
alphabet. lie cannot give its full his
tory, nor suggest a truly valuable im
provement upon it, nor even say it
backwards without making a mistake.
When the studen . finds that this is
true of everything which he had pre
viously thought that he knew, he may
very naturally feel a desire to turn to
some other pursuit in which the
triumphs are speedy and final. lie
will find such a pursuit right under
his nose. lie will see that the man
who makes a home run with the bases
full, exhausts the possibilities of the
situation, so that anything which he
or anybody else may do afterwards,
wi'l be, at best, no more than a repeti
tion. And though the finest player in
the world may scarcely hope for so
much <.florv as that, there are lesser
achievements which have the same
agreeable quality of completeness, and
arc nearly sure to come.
