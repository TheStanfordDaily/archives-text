# Lighting and Electricity in the Air.
## 
### 
One hundred and forty-two
years ago a philospher jotted
down in his note-hook: "Lightning
resembles the electric fluid in color,
appearance, in sulphurous smell,
in noise, in being conducted by
metals, and in killing animals.
We do not know that it is attracted
by points, but since it resembles
electricity in so many respects,
probably it does in this respect too.
Let the experiment be tried!"
This is the reasoning that led
Franklin to believe that a rod
could be constructed, serving a dou
ble purpose of attracting lightning
and carrying it harmlessly to the
ground. We are all familar with
Franklin's kite experiments, first
tried in 1752. We use kites nowa
days in experimenting, having
them in tandem,eight on one string,
supporting a metal plate weighing
two pounds, eighteen hundred feet
above the ground, for many hours.
In the region of air one thousand
to one thousand five hundred feet
high occur the greatest changes of
the atmosphere and this is also the
region we are least able to tell
about.
The clouds are the great conduct
ors and accumulators of electricity.
Some of the finest photographs of
cloud effects have been taken from
the Blue Hills meteorological obser
vatory. Thunder storms reach
their highest perfection as seen from
Ben Nevis observatory —4400 feet
above thesea —that place some
what resembling our own Tanial
pias. The largest observatory in
the world is in Germany. We have
few observatories in this country
compared with those abroad.
Very few would imagine that
there is a great similarity
of the air during a thunder
storm and a snow storm, but it is
true.
In this country we hardly realize
the havoc caused by storms until
we know that on an average more
than two hundred lives are lost
yearly by lightning, and it is inter
esting to note that not every one
who is struck by lightning is nec
essarily killed.
The great question is, can not we
utilize the lightning, one flash of
which results of experiments have
proven averages 75 horse-power.
In the matter of fires alone in the
United States lightning has caused
a loss of more than fifteen million
dollars during the last decade.
Lightning is a great purifier of
the atmosphere from dust, smoke,
etc., and it has been suggested to be
possible to dissipate fog with it.
There are possibilities of great ad
vantages to humanity from the
development of its control and
use. In what direction have we a
more promising field?
Mr. McAdiegave some fine stere
opticon views of the different ob
servatories, atmospheric maps,
wonderful cloud effects, the differ
ent kinds of lightning, etc., making
his lecture highly entertaining as
well as instructive.
