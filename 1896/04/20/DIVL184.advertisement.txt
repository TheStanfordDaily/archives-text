All who rit It* the bicycle will ho wearing
the Deimel Linen—Mesh Underwear.
Those who do now are enthusiastic in
praising it.
P-ople who exercise much, such as
wheelmen, ball players and lovers of!
other kinds of athletic sport, ought to
appreciate the invaluable advantages of
our Linen-Mesh Underwear, which ab
sorbs the perspiration and dries quickly,
In-nee feels warm and comfortable dur
ing exercise and after; which neither
overheats the bod)- while exercising, nor
chills it when at rest, and which never
clings to the body like a wet woolen or
cotton garment. These facts speak for
themselves.
Mr. Lewis Herreshoff of Defender
fame, has this to say: "1 think the
I'eimel Linen-Mesh should be worn by
all who ride the bicycle; you should lay
tar more stress on that."
