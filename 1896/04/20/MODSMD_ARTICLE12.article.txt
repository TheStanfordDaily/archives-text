We note with pleasure the ap
pointment of .Mr. Herbert T. Nash
as librarian of the University in
place of Professor Woodruff. Mr.
Xash was for years the secretary
and confidential advisor of the
late Senator Stanford, and
the appointment is therefore
all the more fitting. Mr. Nash
is, moreover, a scholar and a man
of deep culture, who is in every way
capable of filling the important po
sition to which he has been ap
pointed.
