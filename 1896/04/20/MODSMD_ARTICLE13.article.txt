Tmo University is fortunate in
securing the celebrated Wagnerian
tenor, Anton Schott, fora concert
in the chapel Thursday evening.
Scliott is recognized as one of the
greatest of living tenors, and as the
concert is to be for the benefit of
the Mildebrand Library Fund, it
is doubtful if the chapel will bold
all who wish to attend. It
would be advisable to hold the con

can be no possibility of aisles, doors,
and windows being occupied, as is
often the case with entertainments
i n the chapel.
