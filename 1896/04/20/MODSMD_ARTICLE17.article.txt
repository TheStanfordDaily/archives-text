### HOWARD FIELDING 
Copvrirht, tScÂ«.

Lawrence's thoughts took such a
course as this while he sat scowling at
hi.i book, and when he had reached the
point to which the reader has been
brought, he lifted his gloomy eyes from
Rood old Horace and fixed them upon
Paddy O'Toole. The hour which was 1
early f,>r Lawrence wasjlate for I'addy,
who was ordinarily asleep by ten. The
sight of him at that moment would
naturally have led one to believe that
the youth had been kept from his i
bed by a multitude of the most agree
able thoughts, lie sat in a big arm
chair with his head thrown back, and
smiled at the ceiling.
"What are you thinking about, Pat
rick?" asked Lawrence.
"Nothing," answered I'addy, with
the utmost cheerfulness.
"Hut, great heavens, man. Your
mind couldn't have been an absolute
blan It.'*
"Don't you fool yourself about my
mind.*' rejoined Paddy. "It seems to
worry you a big lot, but it never
bothers me any."
"You were thinking of something
agreeable," said Lawrence, positively.
"Your face showed it."
I'addy rubbed liis head doubtfully.
"Well," ho admitted at last, "I was
feeling pretty good."
"I perceive the distinction," said
Lawrence. "The point is well taken. 1
would like to feel better and think less
my: elf. I would like to change places
with you. Patrick."
"Do vou mean that you'd like to play >
ball?"
"Well, if it comes to that, 1 would; ;
though that was only a small part of }
my thought on the matter."
I'addy slowly and gently pitched an
i mamillary out curve.
"You can't," he said. "It isn't in !
you."
"You might teach me."
"Not in a thousand years,'* said Pad
dy. promptly.
"I don't believe it. It is incredible i
that you should know anything that
1 can't learn."
I'addy <li<l not respond. The idea
failed to appeal to him. Lawrence
tried another line of approach.
"Is there anything in my life," h'> |
asked, "that would make you wish t
change with me?"
"Yes, there is." responded Paddy.
"You go to places that I'd like to go
to. You see all those irirls any j
time that you want to. Say, tiiey're a S
great crew! They got hold of me out j
on the field, and 1 never struck any- ;
thing like it in my life. Say, they just ;
talked the cars oit of me, and they can j
do it again any time they're ready. It j
was great."
"You enjoyed their conversation?"
"You bet! It, was up to the limit. I
Hut 1 didn't get a show. I couldn't I
say anything but yes and no; and I'm j
telling you there were times when it J
was all 1 could do to get in as many j
words as that. They talked most all j
the time themselves."
"I can readily believe it."
"1 had things to say, though. I'm
no dummy. 1 wanted to f ell the girl |

that taliced the most about the pamf
that she didn't know enough about
base bail to keep tally on a hoard witl
a piece of ehaik. lint of course 1
couldn't do it. I'd promised your
brother.'"
"It's a pity you didn't say it," said
Lawrence.
"I've been thinking that perhaps it
was just as well that I didn't," said
I'addy, reflectively. "She might have
got mad."
"Unquestionably; but the other girls
would have loved you forever. There
is m> gain in this world without some
small loss, and especially not in society,
for you lose your time, if .nothing else.
However, you should have said it care
fully and with tact. It is possible that
I could teach you how to do those
things."
"Say, will you do it?" said l'addy,
with unwonted animation. "I'd Idee to
learn that. I ain't much on grammar
and those other things that your
brother tried to drive into me. but I c.ai
learn anything that's got sense to it,
and is going to come handy to a fel
low."
