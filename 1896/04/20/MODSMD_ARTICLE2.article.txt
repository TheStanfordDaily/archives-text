# The
						Junior Prom.
## 
### 
On Friday evening the .Junior
festivities were brought to a fitting
close with a most successful ball.
Tile stage made a very neat appear
ance at the end of tne gymnasium,
and far from detracting from the
evening's pleasure, rather added to
it. There was plenty of space for
the dancers, though they numbered
over fifty couples on the floor dur
ing most of the dances.
The walls were hidden beneath
evergreens, while bunting and fes
toons of green hung from the ceil
ing. Chairs and divans were
placed about the walls.
Except the grand march, about
which there was some mistake, the
dances, twenty-four in number,
came off as programed. Two ex
tras were added, but the mandate
as to early "lights out" prevented
more extras. Refreshments were
served during the evening.
The music was as fine as was
ever obtained fora like function
here. The trombone solo was es
pecially fine, and the entire musical
program was one of the treats of
the evening. In a large measure
the success of the evening was due
to the efforts of President Ilenne;
he was greatly assisted by Harry
llazzard.
Among those present were a
large number of ladies from t>an
.lose and San Francisco.
