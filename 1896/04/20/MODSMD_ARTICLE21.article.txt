As the season advances and new
men develop, track enthusiasts are
beginning to be concerned about
next year's team. Of this year's
stars Reynolds, Toombs, Bernhard,
and Hazzard will graduate, while
Brown, under the four-years rule,
will be disqualified next year. In
terest,, then, is naturally centered
on the men who will take their
places. A sprinter may enter the
University at any time who will
need no especial training to put him
into shape, but a distance runner, a
hurdler, or a weight-putter has
to he made.
Barring accidents, then, the
weights, the pole-vault, the quarter
mile, the sprints, and the bicycle
race will be represented by mem
bers of this year's team. Two or
three fair jumpers will be left, and
one good walker, but there will he
vacant places in the hurdles and in
the distance runs. For the mile
two good new men are training —
Smith, '99, and Williams,
Smith has endurance and sand but
he has not yet developed a stride.
Williams, on the other hand, has a
long, free stride, hut he is still
young and immature, so that he
has not sufficient endurance for the
distance runs. Both have worked
down near to the five-minute mark,
and promise of becoming good
runners.
Strong, '99, Picher, '98, and
Pope, '97, are working at the hur
dles. The first two are well built,
but they have worked so short a
time that it i.- impossible to make
any prophesies as to their future
form, l'ope is working hard and
getting into good form. He does
not seem strong enough for the
event, but time he has made re
cently shows that he is likely to
prove a factor next year.
Seale, '97, and Walker, '98. are
two unknown quantities who are
working faithfully in the half mile.
There are green men of consider
able promise training for the other
events, but interest centers on the
tfreen hurdlers and distance run
ners, who must represent us in these
events next vear.
