# The 						Junior Farce.
## 
### 
Never were the decorations more
elaborate, never did the gymnasium
look prettier than on Friday morn
ing when the curtain was rung up

on "A Stanford Deal," the farce
coined)' by J. M. Ross.
The "Deal" was an attempt to
capture three important student
body offices, and the deep-laid
schemes of the aspirant were clev
erly drawn. The "Ski Hi" frater
nity places itself in opposition to
the plot, and avows that it shall
fail. Unknown to them, however,
their freshman initiate is forced
into supporting the plan, and the
faculty member is secured in the
same way. The would-be corrup
tionist confides his plan to a co-ed,
who becomes jealous of his atten
tions to another and consequently
allows the secret to become known.
In the last scene the faculty mem
ber is won over by the fraternity;
he is assured that he will be pro
tected, and that his hidden life will
not be revealed. Thus the schemer
loses his supporters one by one,
and is finally expelled in disgrace
by the angry professor.
The parts were all extremely well
taken, those of Miss Cowen, Lake,
Thomas, and l'rice being especially
commendable. Hits and jokes
were abundant throughout the
play, a good share of which were
directed at members of the faculty.
The work of the orchestra was
excellent and called forth several
encores.
