From the showing made in Sat
urday's game Berkeley will un
doubtedly bring the strongest nine
she has ever had into the inter
collegiate contest. Morden seems
to be effective in spite of his vvild
ness, and Wheeler supports him
fairly well. The infield is said to
be weak on the left side, but it was
not apparent in the game. The
outfielders cover considerable
ground and work well together.
