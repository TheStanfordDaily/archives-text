# The 						Intercollegiate Game Tomorrow.
## 
### 
Tomorrow, if the rain does not
prevent, the team goes to Berkeley
to play the lirst intercollegiate
baseball game. Two of our best
players have been ill the past few
(lavs, but the following men will
probably compose the Varsity: Mc-
Laine and Jeffs, battery; Young,
Harris, Taylor, and Sharp, inHeld;
Stansbury, Freeman, Thompson,
outfield; Wight, and Strobn or Hill,
substitutes. Their opponents are
stronger than any previous IJ. C.
team,;tnd tin? men can not depend
on prestige for victory, but must
play luird for it. Captain McLaine
deserves the earnest support of his
players for his conscientious work
throughout the season.
The men will play as follows:
.Jeft's, catcher; McLaine, pitcher;
Young, first base; Harris, second
base; Sharp, third base; Taylor,
short stop; Stansbury, left field;
Freeman, center field; Thompson,
right field. Substitutes, Wight and
Stroll n.
The last game with Reli
ance showed a decided increase
in batting strength in our team,
though they still depend on
McLaine to do the major portion of
the work. The large score is ac
counted for by the fact that their
opponents made nearly twenty er
rors. This poor support of the Re
liance pitchers must have had some
thing to do with the heavy batting
of Stanford.
McLaine, Jeffs, Harris, and Tay
lor, in spite of occasional mistakes,
are doing the best they know how
in practice. Sharp, Young, and
the outfielders need considerable
drill before they reach first-class
form. The players are doing a lit
tle better in getting down to first
base.
The Varsity now ranks as fol
lows in general batting: Wight,
.391; Harris, .884; Taylor, .860;
Jeffs, .888; Thompson, .888; Free
man, .858; Sharp, .2V)7; McLaine,
.274; Stansbery, .240; Young, .250;
Strolm, .190. Thompson leads in
the Varsity contests.
The team will meet at Encina
Hall at 9 o'clock tomorrow morn
ing to take the flyer for the city.
