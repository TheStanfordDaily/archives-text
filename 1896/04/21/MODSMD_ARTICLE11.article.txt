"1 will do it gladly," said Lawrence,
"if you will teach me to play ball."
Paddy sat up and looked Lawrcncein
the eye.
"You don't mean that you want to
get out there on the field and pitch a
game?" lie asked.
"I mean just that."
"Not against Harvard?"
"Against Harvard especially."
"IS you go uj> against those fellows."
said Paddy in a hushed ami solemn
tone, "they'll make a thousand home
runs."
"Let them do it if they can, " respond
ed Lawrence, firmly. "All » ask of
you is to give me a chance to try. You
teach me all you can about pitching,
and I'll teach you all I can about how
t > behave in society. Then yon fix it
no that I can pitch a game, and ! will
get you into the sweUest social affair
that there is in New Haven during the
remainder of the season."
"It's a said Paddy. "It ain't
quite a square deal on your brother,
but it's even worse for us. Say, they'll
bat you out of the box. It will ruin
you."
"It may," said Lawrence, "both
ways. Hut I'll take tin? risk."
"Don't you be afraid of my part of
it." rejoined Paddy. "That'll be all
i*:;rht. Say. shall I put on that, swa!
1 iw-tailed dress suit of yours now. and
learn to sit down in it?"
Lawrence agreed; and thus was rati
fied a most nefarious agreement calcu
lated to be highly detrimental to the

university. It must be admitted that
I'addy did extremely well. Within an
hour he h i 1 m istered the fashionable
hand-sh ike. ;;n I had learned to enter a
room with.>ut giving the impression
that he was hunting for trouble. Law

The next (hiy. howevei, the boot was
on the other leg, and the relations
between teacher and pupil were less
cordial.
La wrencc may have been by nature
as apt a scholar as the other, but the
young gentleman from the South Cove
was wholly lacking in the educational
method.
They went to a vacant lot in a se
cluded part of the city, and there prac
ticed in the shelter of a board fence.
"You've got to learn the curves to

begin wi»h." said Paddy. "We'll begin
with the outcurvr because t lu re's some
kind of a chance that you can learn it
iu two or three years. Now take the
ball this way ami slam it in."
Paddy hurled the ball against the
board fence and .splinters Hew off the
board which it struck.
"I would suggest, 1 ' said Lawrence,
turning his spectacles toward Paddy,
"that you give me some brief the
oretical demonstration of the leading
principle involved."
"(.iive you what?" gasped Paddy.
"Say, 1 ain't got it with me."
"1 mean that instead of resorting to
simple imitation, which will be ex
tremely diflicult for me as I am unfa
n.iliar with the method, you would do
better to give me a sort of lecture on
the subject at first. Then 1 can begin
work with an intelligent appreciation
of the necessities of the ease."
