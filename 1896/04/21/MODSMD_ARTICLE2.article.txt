# Facts Concerning the Great German Tenor.

### 
In the celebrated Kaiserburg
Hohenstaufen, the birth place of
Friedrich Barbarossa, the great
ruler of the German Empire, was
also the birth place of one of Ger
many's greatest singers, Ilerr
Anton Schott. He came from a
noble family and grew up in the
old castle amidst the densest foliage
of the Black Forest. Schott might
well quote Wagner's Meistersinger:
"In forest and by birdie's song
there was I taught my singing."
He was sent at an early age to
Karlschule, the celebrated military
school at which the poet Schiller re
ceived his early education. He
became a commissioned officer
when only eighteen years of age
and served in both the Aust.ro-
Prussian and Franco-Prussian
wars.
The extraordinary power of his
voice was first noticed when he
was leading his troops to battle.
His commands could be clearly
heard above the thunder of cannon

and din of battlefield. At night
when gathered around the camp
tires he loved to use his power of
singing to cheer his wearied com
rades. After the Austro-Prnssian
war was over he spent several years
in garrison at Ludwigshurg and be
came the favorite of the late
Charles 1 of Wurtemberg. Some
celebrated artists urged him to
cultivate his voice for public sing
ing, but he persistently refused to
do so on account of the prejudice
of his class against the stage.
Finally he was drawn in by
artifice, and his enthusiasm was
soon awakened.
Immediately after the Franco-
Prussian war he began to perform
for the Emperor at the Royal Op
era House, Berlin, in all the lead
ing parts of Mozart's and Weber's
operas, by the side of the great
Niemann. At this time he was a
frequent visitor to the house of
Bancroft, then American ambassa
dor to Germany.
A little later we find him the
pioneer of German art and Wagner
ian music at all the capitals of
the old world, and his fame rap
idly growing. When he was ren
dering Wagner in English for the
London public, the New York Her
ald was kept busy with cable dis
patches recording his triumphs,
lie quickly mastered a foreign
tongue, and the Pall Mall Gazette
said of him: "He sings English
like a Scotch lord."
The late Leopold Damrosh now
wired him to organize a company
of fine singers for the Metropolitan
in New York. Who has not heard
of the Grand German Opera in'B6?
Schott sang at seventy-eight out of
eighty-eight of these performances,
and the papers used to speak of
him as "our great tenor."
In rendering the German Lied,
especially Beethoven's, Schubert's,
and Schumann's, his success was
even greater than in the opera. In
fact, he has not a rival, even in his
own country.
