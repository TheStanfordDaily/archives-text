If the present state of the weather
continues there is little probability
of the schedule game between the
U. C. and Stanford baseball teams
taking place tomorrow. In a way
perhaps it is better that it should
not, for our team is far from being
in proper condition for playing
good baseball. Two of the men are
on the sick list, and it is upon one
of them in particular that we have
relied the most for our chances of
defeating Berkeley again this year.
It is particularly unfortunate that
these illnesses should come at this
time, for now, if ever, all the play
ers should be in the best possible
form; but at the same time we are
confident that the team even in its
weakened condition will be able to
give a most excellent account of
itself. We shall of course lose the
best services of the two men in
question, but we shall not be de
prived of their assistance entirely;
and there is not one of us but feels
that even with such aid our base
ball team will be able to repeat the
performance of last year.
