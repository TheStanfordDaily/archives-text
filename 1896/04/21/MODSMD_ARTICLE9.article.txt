It is n point often made by ad
herents of .Stanford University that
the chief feature ad well as merit of
our college requirements is the un
usual amount of individual and
original work expected of the stu
dents. Whether this claim in its
entirety is true, a great many per
haps will not he willing to acknowl
edge; hut that the tirst portion is
l rue, viz.. in respect to this particular
kind of work being the main feature
of our college duties, does not ad
mit of contradiction. It is indeed
doubtful if there is another educa
tional institution in this country,
with the exception of t he post-grad
uate universities, which requires as
much written work of its students
as does this University. And more
over we are rapidly beginning to
rival the institutions of post-grad
uate rank in this respect. The re
mark has recently and very appro
priately been made that the chief
aim of Stanford instruction is to
pursue the courses of study and
methods undertaken bv institutions
of the very highest learning, only
on a much smaller scale.
That such a method, if pursued

wisely, will he productive of the
greatest good is of course evident,
hut that it can he followed to ex
cess is equally plain. In their en
thusiasm fort he scheme some of the
professors are apt to forget that the
students in their particular classes
are taking other work besides their
own, and are already perhaps heing
burdened with reports and theses
thrust upon them from a variety
of sources. Consequently many
have been seriously crowded in
their work through this over-impo
sition on the part of their instruct
ors. Furthermore, the fact should
not be lost sight of that our library
facilities are not the most extensive
in the world, and one is often un
able to find either material or fiicts
bearing upon the topics that have
been assigned to him, in the time
al lowed.
