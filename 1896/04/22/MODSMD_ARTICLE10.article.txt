Thk prospects are very favorable
fora large gathering at the concert
tomorrow night. It is certainly
desirable that our appreciation of
Herr Schott's kindness in visiting
Stanford should he shown by ;i
generous reception. We hope that
this man of noble birth who is ac
customed to sing to royalty and
aristocracy will carry away with
him pleasant memories of this
democratic university.
The world is full of singers, but
there are comparatively few of them
who have added to a natural apti
tude for music a thorough technical
knowledge of musical composition.
Herr Schott was by birth a musi
cian of great power. Long years of
patient study, made possible by a
competence and encouraged by an
inborn love qf music, have added
to natural ability an understand
ing of the underlying principles of
music which, it is safe to say, isun
approached by any other person
living today.
The receipts of the concert will
be devoted to paying off the delrt
of the Hildebrand Library, but the
promoters are not relying upon

this fact in the least to secure an
i audience. It is but a wither reason
! why those interested in the I'tii-
S versity should be present. Those
| who enjoy an evening of song
j should not miss this opportunity to
| spend tomorrow evening with one
I of the world's favorites.
