# About Our Trackmen.
## 
### 
There was no training on the
cinder path or lield yesterday even
ing. The men will not do any
more training before the field-day,
hut will take a daily course in ihe
gymnasium and receive the atten
tion of the rubber. Besides those
chosen to represent us by the try
out contests, some men have been
privately selected by Capt. Toombs.
The team will be composed of twen
ty-live men, ihe greater part of
whom have before been in the lists
for the cardinal. The new men
have trained hard and faithfully
under the instruction of the old
standbys and should give a good
account of themselves in the inter
collegiate contest.
Although Stanford has entered
but twenty-five men she has men
for three places in every event with
but few exceptions. Several of the
men will take as many as three or
four events.
As the time for the field-day ap
proaches interest in it grows apace,
and it is expected that when the
day comes the greater part of the
students will be found in the city
cheering our athletes to victory for
the cardinal.
The track team assembled at
Thors' in Paio Alto this afternoon
to have a picture taken.
