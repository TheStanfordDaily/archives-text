The country seat of Herr Anton
Scliott is an old feudal castle in
the.historic region around Nuren
hurg, which he purchased a few
years ago. Shortly afterward he
received letters from several of Ger
many's most noted historians in
forming him that his homestead
was the ancestral castle of the
Hoht nzollei n, the imperial family
of (,«t rmany. "Schloss Abenberg"
is over one thousand years old and
perhaps Germany's oldest castle.
The late Emperor William and
members of other royal families
descended from the Hohenzollern
have visited llerr Scliott in this,
their ancestral home.
Schott's greatest successes are
probably those made in Denmark
and Italy. Fora German to sing
in Denmark when the wars of '45>
and '(i-l were still fresh in the
memory of the people was a deed
of noble daring in the cause of
peace and good will. At Copen
hagen he gave a German "Lieder
Abend.'' Three times he had to
repeat Siegmund's love song of
Wagner's Walkyre; the Queen of
Denmark, the well-known "mother
in-law of half Europe," personally
leading the applauders. All the
papers declared that never before
had a male artist, not even Listz or
Rubinstein, achieved such a
triumph.
He now began to sing at the
National Opera in Copenhagen, but
all the t fforts of king, people, and
press could not alter the minister's
determination to keep him from
singing in German. Finally
Scliott took the matter into his own
hands and called upon the minis
ter. The result was that Scliott
sang Lohengrin in German that
nijJit with the Kings of Denmark,

Sweden, and Greece in the audi
ence. On that day, when German >
resounded for the first time on the]
national stage of Denmark, Schott I
won a noble victory for Germany, j
He did with his voice what two
wars could not accomplish —"he ;
conquered the hearts of the enemies J
of Germany."
In Italy there is still an envious
feeling on account of Germany's
superiority in music. Wagner's
music has dwarfed Italian art so
that it takes a lower rank even in 1
Italy. Schott brought Wagner to
all the prominent cities of Italy
and met with grand success. The
Italians knew that Wagner's art
would sound the knell to theirs,
yet they submitted with grace and
even enthusiasm. This nation of
singers appreciated Schott imme
diately and he was received most
heartily.
