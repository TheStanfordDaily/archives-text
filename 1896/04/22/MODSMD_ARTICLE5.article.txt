# "Be Thou Strong."
## 
### 
Sunday's sermon was delivered
by Rev. Charles \V. W'endleof Oak
land. The parable of the laborers in
the vineyard was read (Matthew xx,
1-17), but the text was chosen from
1 Kings ii, 2: "lie thou strong
j. . . and show thyself a man."
Our modern habits of exchange
i are different from those of the time
j of the parable. The modern mar
ket place is the daily newspaper,
j noisy and restless, forming a
I marked contrast with the quiet
| methods of the older time. But
though the customs of man have
changed with the centuries, the
principles underlying human action
i have remained the same. The re
lations of employer and employee
I are practically the same as two
thousand years ago. There is still
j hiring and selling, still idleness and
clissipation. Yet there is plenty of
i work for those who can do it.
Glance down the columns of a
I newspaper and you will sec the
j words "Man wanted." In every
j walk of life men are wanted; and
j yet everybody knows there is
I nothing so hard to lind as a man.
I A man is wanted; not merely so
much bone and sinew, but mental
j force and vigor and stamina; in a
I word, manhood.
We say the market is overstocked,
I business is dull. This may be
i true, but it is only a half-truth,
j Failure to get on in the world is
due to lack of manhood. The only
j cure for our ills is manhood. The
! really good doctor, merchant, pro
cessor can always linda place. The
I ancient philosopher said, "Give me
| standing room and I will move the
i world." But Goethe said, "A true
; man will make a place for himself
and then move the world '' We
must not feel disheartened if the
market-place is overstocked. All
the while the householder looks in
vain for workers —men.
There never was a time when a
man counted for as much as now.
We sometimes speak of the fearful
j competition which characterizes
j our day ms crushing out manhood.
; This is true to a certain extent,
perhaps, but are not the monopo
lies evidence of strong
and virile manhood? Is there not
something in the force of these men
who are behind monopolies and
dominate them that commands
our appreciation, our praise, our

respect? Uneducated and unknown
tlley have almost without exception
worked their way up to fame and
fortune. Envious people look up
and seek to follow hut fail, for they
lack the energy, the persistence, the
self-denial, which has given success
to the people they seek to emulate.
I might goon and show that it
is men rather than measures that
today dominate our political par
ties. Everywhere it is really a
man who decides things. And so
' while we believe in ideals emdodied
in measures, we should believe still
more in ideals embodied in men
and women. A noble personality
quickens our feeble pulses, inspires
us with a fervent zeal, raises our
ideals, and carries us forward on
the resistless tide of human progress.
To be successful a man does not
so much need native gifts as the
power to apply these gifts. If a
man have courage and energy and
tenacity of pur] ose, he has within
himself the making of a man and
the promise <>112 success in life. But
aside from these qualities the ideal
man must have three other quali
ties: a moral heart, a quick con
science, and righteousness. The
history of men like Napoleon shows
| us how necessary is the lirst to true
| and lasting greatness; without the
| second the fundamental and all-im
i portant principle of justice would
be abrogated and the very existence
of society threatened; and in the
! last—righteousness —we have a
summing up of all that goes to
I make a man —courage, energy, per
sistence, conscientiousness, all that
constitutes manhood and t he perfect
man. Such was the Man of Naza
i reth. And as we roll back the cur
tain of time, and see him standing
I there in all the majesty of his man
hood, he seems to say, <l He strong,
! and show yourself a man."
