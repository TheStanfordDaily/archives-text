HJveky one who goes t«> the field
day next Saturday should l»y all
means remain to the intercollegiate
debate Saturday night. Berkeley's
proximity to Han Francisco gives
her a decided advantage over us in
one respect. It is easy for her to
have a much larger number of sym
pathizers on hand than it is possible
for Stanford to bring together. For
this reason more strenuous efforts
should be made to have every Stan
ford man stay who can possibly do
so.
In the debaters who represent
Stanford we can put all confidence.
We know that better men could
not be chosen to uphold our repu
tation as a university in which
this very important part of an edu
cation is not neglected by the stu
dents. We can trust our debaters
to do us justice on the platform.
I>ut they should not be left alone
to contend against Berkeley for
this year's laurels. Let no lack of
interest prevent them from seeing
the faces of their well-known friends
in the audience.
