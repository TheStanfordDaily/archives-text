BEFORE LONG
All who ride tiit' bicycle will lie wearing
the 1 >t'i n i«. 1 Linen—M esh Underwear.
Those who <i<> now arc enthusiastic in<
praising it.
I' ojile who exercise ntuch, such as
wheelmen, hall plaxers and lovers ol
other kinds of athletic sport, ought to
appreciate the invaluable advantages of
our Linen-Mesh Underwear, which ab
sorbs the perspiration and dries quickly,
hence leels warm and comtoriaMe dur
ing exercise and after; winch neither
overheats the body while exercising, nor
chills it when at rest, and which never
clmgs to the body like a wet woolen or
cotton garment. These facts speak for
themselves.
Mr. Lewis Ilerreshoff of Defender
tame, has this to say: "I think the
i>eimel Linen-Mesh should be worn b\
all who ride tiie bicycle: you should lav i
tar more stress on that."
