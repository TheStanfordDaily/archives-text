# STANFORD VICTORIOUS
## Berkeley Ball Players No Match for the Cardinal Representatives. 
### 
The first intercollegiate baseball
game of the year is ours by a score j
of 14 to S. It was a victory with-j
out great glory, but a victory never
theless. U. C. had a lead of three]
runs until the fifth inning, when a j
complete case of "rattles'' gave
Stanford ten runs and the game in
two innings. Every one of Berk
eley's nine errors counted towards
runs, while only three of Stanford's |
mishaps were costly.
U. C. set the ball rolling with ;
two runs on a base on balls audi
ground-hits by Johnston and Mc- j
Laren. For Stanford, Jeffs reached j
first on Krug's error, stole second,
and came home on Young's drive
over second.
Berkeley scored twice more in i
the third. Taylor cut off Henner-,
sy's apparently safe hit over second, i
but drew Young off his base on the
throw to first. Hennersy knocked !
Y r
a short fly over first which Young
could not quite hold, and Johnston
and McLaren followed with singles.
Stanford strove ineffectually to
score until the fifth; then they had
the game given them as follows: j
McLaren juggled Freeman's hit to
short; Morden misjudged of Mc-
Laine's grounder; and Taylor drew
a base on balls—the bases were full. |
Then Jeffs hit to the pitcher who
threw to Wheeler to catch Freeman.
The catcher muffed and Freeman
and McLaine scored. Jeffs bit to
the third baseman who returned
the ball too low to the catcher to
head off Taylor. Wheeler threw
himself on the ground across the
base-path to stop the throw, but j
missed it, and the next instant
Taylor, who was unable to stop,
collided with and knocked the
breath out of him. Wheeler re
sinned his mask in a few moments
and played about up to his former
mediocre standard. Young was
next at the bat, making a second
hit, and Sharp followed with a
three-bagger to center. Sharp
crossed the plate a moment later
on Thompson's out at first —seven
runs for Stanford.
In the sixth Elston made a two-j
bagger and Hennessy brought him
in with a single. Johnston drop
ped McLaine's high fly in Stan
ford's half. Taylor got his base on
balls, and Harris brought them in
with a hit over second. Harris
went to third on a wild pitch and
scored while McLaren held the
ball. Singles by McLaine and
Taylor brought in another run in
the eighth, which IJ. C. equalled
on Harris's and Taylor's errors.
Errors by Elston, Johnston, and
Wheeler gave Stanford two more in
the eighth. Berkeley made a des
perate effort to win in the ninth
but it was too late.
McLaine deserves great credit
for staying out the game in spite of
his recent illness, which told se
verely on bis pitching. Jeffs did
not support him well at first, but
played his usual game in the last
few innings; he ran bases well.
Young's batting was good, but bis
fielding only fair. Harris was
nervous in fielding, but made a
timely hit. Taylor played well
considering his illness. Sharp

fielded very well but 'struck out
three times to make up for his
three-hagger. Stansbery dropped
his only chance in the Held, but
Freeman and Thompson each made
a good catch, the hitter's being of
the circus order. This trio failed
to get a base-hit between them.
Hennersy, McLaren, and Elston
made the best showing for U. C.
McLaren and Elston however aided
in the general confusion which
gave Stanford the game.
The teams meet next on our own
diamond, and we hope that
McLaine will be recovered, his team
not afraid to bat, and the U. C.
team not affected by "rattles."
