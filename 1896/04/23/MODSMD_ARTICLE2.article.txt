Editor Daily Palo Alto:
To those who expect to exercise
their right of suffrage here this
year it may be well for them to
note that the great register of Santa
Clara County was cancelled by the
supervisors on the 14th inst. Un
der the new law registration will
close on Aug. 10, three months be
fore the general election.
All voters muxt register before
that time. As many professors
and students who go away for va
cation will not return until after
Aug. 10 they should register before
the end of the semester.
Voters can be registered by the
County Clerk at San Jose, or by
bis deputies Peter Mayer at May
field,and B. F. Hall at Palo Alto.
