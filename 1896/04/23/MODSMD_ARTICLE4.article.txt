# "London Life In Shakspere's Time."

### 
A most interesting lecture was!
given on Tuesday evening l>y Pro-'
fessor Hudson. The substance of
his remarks was in part as follows.!
Our subject leads us at once from !
the main paths of history into the:
bypaths of everyday life, and it is !
not the great historian, the states j
man, or philosopher, but rat her th e J
players whom we accept as our!
guides.
It might not be amiss to pause |
for a moment to consider some of
the general aspects of the period
with which we are to be concerned, j
Looking at the political conditions, J
the history of the reign of Queen i
Elizabeth is a history of consolida
tion rather than change, not an
introduction of fresh elements but
reorganization and expansion. The
growth of strong commercial cen
tres acted as a powerful aid in the
destruction of feudal ideas, and the
multitude of people began to be ac
knowledged, and the country at
large was growing richer, stronger
and more united, with more freedom
of thought and speech. But with
all this advancement there were
dark sides. The age was noted for
its licentiousness, its crime, and
brutality. it was a pagan age.
Gross freedom obtained throughout
society, the laws were horribly bru
tal, and manners were rude.
These things were all but the dif
ferent facets of the national charac
ter. But beneath all this brutal ism
there was that which was lacking
in the southern character, the
strength which formed the safety of
the English people.
During this time London was
increasing rapidly in extent, pop
ulation, and power, yet how differ
ent was the metropolis of the Eliz
abethan age from the metropolis of
today! It was a limited, walled
city, and represented a very small
portion of what is now included.
At nine o'clock in the evening when
the bells rung the gates were shut
for the night and the citizens retired
with the protection of armed watch
men. Within and about the walls
were many old churches, six score
and four it has been said, and
many prisons to help the churches
in their work. Open spaces and
numerous trees, fields, and brooks
were to be seen where now is a
dense city. Through all this way
into the open country ran the silver
Thames, the great silent highway,
spanned by one famous bridge, and
bearing upon its current thousands
of boats and barges. The Strand
was a long country road. At Char
ing Cross was an ancient cross,
giving the place its name, and be
yond, the flats known as Hay
market, and the old country road
called Piccadilly. In the other di
rection was Westminster, and no
man who valued his life would ven
ture to walk alone after dark as far
as Hyde Park corner.
In the streets there was little of
the hurry and turmoil of modern
city street life, though it was by no
means sleepy. The appearance of
a vehicle in the street was enough
to attract attention.
The private houses were built ir
regularly, the upper stories often
I extending so far across the way
that Johnson says ladies and their
lovers could exchange confidences

across the wayâ€”"Argue from dif
ferent premises," as Holmes would
say.
Itinerant vendors patrolled the
streets announcing their wares.
There were fish-wives, orange wo
men, chimney sweeps, mounte
banks, and peddlers of al 1 descrip
tions.
The struggle for wealth was not
so keen as today, but wide roads
were open to young men of courage,
and fortunes to be made. The
shopkeepers were equal to those of
today in devices, such as darken
ing the shop so as to conceal de
fects of their wares, and the art of
cozening by short weights and
measures. The houses were not
numbered, but were known by
signs and names. These names
are now abandoned, except by the
public houses or saloons. There
was a close mingling of the classes
in their trades, but notwithstand
ing this the classes remained dis
tinct and were rarely ever bridged
over. A young apprentice might
make a fortune, but looked no
higher than his master's daughter
fora helpmate. Money could do
much, but could not give entrance
as now to the upper society. The
people may be divided into two
classes: the gentry and the citi
zens. The latter lived in a simple
way in or near their shops, but
the former were more distributed
and the aristocratic neighborhoods
were outside the city walls.
Among the middle classes there
were many significant changes
b) 7 way of development and im
provement, which mark the break
ing up of tlie old regime and the
building up of the modern founda
tions. Ancient forms were passing
away. The contract basis between
master and servant was beginning
to l>e established and marked a
great advance.
As regards eating, the people
were more temperate, but this ab
stemiousness was only relative be
cause it was an age of gluttony
owing to the frequency of the meals.
The staple article was meat. There
was an immense consumption of
liquor. Tea, coffee, and cocoa were
unknown.
Extravagance of fashion in dress
was most extreme and the mascu
line fashions exceeded in conspicu
ousness those of wpmen.
The society young men had nu
merous accomplishments.
Hut in all this dissolution and
frivolity we can not forget the evi
dences of strong characters, noble
deeds, and bright minds left for the
world to profit by.
