We would urge upon all students
who can possibly do so to be pres
ent both at the intercollegiate tield
day and tlie intercollegiate debate.
There is nothing so disheartening
to our representatives in these im
portant contests as meagre, lialf
souled support. Much can be done
to add to the chances of victory by
rallying to cheer on those who are
to uphold Stanford's reputation
against the representatives of Ber
keley. At this season of the year
there are many circumstances to
prevent a large attendance. The
necessity is all the greater for those
who have no urgent excuse, to turn
out. Let our debaters and our
track athletes be given all the en
cou ragement | iossi 1 tie.
