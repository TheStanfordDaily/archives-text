To the members of the Senior
Class it is gratifying to note that
the arrangements being made for
Commencement Week by the Com
mittee are on a scale in keeping
with the traditions left by the Class
of'95. It is fitting that the first
graduation exercises after our Uni
versity has triumphantly emerged
from under its great cloud should
be memorable. The Committee, in
making the program somewhat
elaborate, has the support of the
class. Nevertheless it may not be
amiss to say that the expense of
such occasions should be carefully
kept within bounds. It has, in re
cent years, become so costly to re
spond to the various "calls" in
some of the eastern universities
that these institutions are practi
cally closed to the student of mod
erate meansâ€”not to mention the
poor student. A similar tendency
may be observed in our own Uni
versity. In so far as this tendency
exists, it is to be regretted. No un
necessary expense should be in
dulged in. It means hardship for
a good many.
