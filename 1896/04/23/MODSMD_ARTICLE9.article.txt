The victory won yesterday by
the Stanford nine on Berkeley's
campus came almost as :i surprise
to many students of this University.
We went into (lie contest seriously
handicapped. At the beginning of
the season we were almost without
experienced players. Indeed, ex

cepting ;i few veterans, all the ma-1
teriiil was raw and untrained. Be
sides this our team was by no
means in good condition for vester- j
day's game, two of the players he-j
ing sick at the time. Very few ac- j
companied them to Berkeley to j
give them encouragement and sup-,
port, and on the whole no one
here would have heen surprised had j
a defeat been announced. Through
out the game Stanford's nine made
an excellent showing in every re
spect, clearly evidencing the benefits
derived from the training of a pro
fessional coach. The result is
highly satisfactory, and with care
and hard work we should not find
it difficult to carry off this year's
championship. There is some dan
ger of over-confidence after yester
day's game, but the chances are
that our men will keep their heads
and go in to win. In any event
the result yesterday is a matter of
utmost satisfaction to Stanford en
thusiasts.
