BEFORE LONG
All who ride the bicycle will be wearing
the Deiiucl Linen-Mesh Underwear.
Those who do now are enthusiastic in
praising it.
People who exercise much, such as
wheelmen, ball players and lovers of
other kinds of athletic sport, ought to
| appreciate the invaluable, advantages of
our Linen-Mesh Underwear, which ab
sorbs the perspiration and dries quickly,
hence feels warm and comfortable dur
ing exercise and after; which neither
| overheats the body while exercising, nor
| chills it when at rest, and which never
| clings to the body like a wet woolen or
cotton garment. These facts speak for
| themselves.
Mr. Lewis Herreshoff of Defender
tame, has this to say: "1 think the
j Deimel Linen-Mesh should be worn by
| all who ride the bicycle; you should lay
J far more stress on that."
