# Tomorrow's Field-Day.
## 
### 
At 2:30 tomorrow, rain or shine,
the speedy men of Stanford iind the
University of California will meet
at the Olympic Club grounds for
the '96 field-day. The struggle is
sure to he close and exciting, al
though the odds on the whole are
in favor of U. C. It is pretty cer
tain, however, that the losingteam,
whichever it may he, will score at
least fifty out of the one hundred
and twelve points.
If the had weather continues
the heavy track will prevent any
record breaking, hut this is as fair
for one side as for the other, so that
it will not materially affect the
• tutccme.
Stanford's representativcs are in
first-rate shape, barring Dole, who
is suffering from a stone hruise on
his heel. The following description
will show the experience of our
men and their prohahle chances.
(leorge Toomhs, captain of this
year's team, is a good example of a
man who has made himself an ath
lete out of unpromising material,
lie won a place in the high jump
in the field-days of '94 and '95.
This year he has turned his atten
tion to sprinting and hroad jump
ing, and gives promise of doing ex
cellent work in these events tomor
row.
I). 10. Brown is the veteran of
the team. He holds the Coast rec
ord of 4:3(1 for the mile run, and
gives promise of heating that mark
this year. He should haveaneasy
victory this year, even though his
brother should he entered in that
event. Everett will not enter the
mile, however, so Stanford should
take this event without trouble.
•J. P. Bernhard entered the Uni
versity with the Class of '96, and
won the hundred-yard dash in his
first intercollegiate field-day. In
*94 and '95 he was beaten by Scrog
gins. This year, however, his old
rival is not in college, and he has
a good chance of winning. He
holds the college record of 10 2-5
seconds for the hundred-yard dash.
He was track captain last year.
John Brunton, '99, was the "find"
of this year's team. He had never
put on spikes until last spring,
when as a student at Manzanita he
went into training on the Stanford
track. In the games at Stockton,
.July 4, he made his debut, taking
five first places and winning the
games for Stanford. He has an
ideal build fora track athlete, and
is good at almost any event except
the weights and the walk, al
though the 440 is his specialty.
The next best man who came in
as a green athlete this year isA. 11.
.lack, '99. who is our hope in the
mile walk. Like Brunton he is
new to athletics. A first-class
walker can not be made in one
season, but Jack already shows
promise of becoming a star man in
liis line.
11. B. Reynolds, '96, never gave
any great amount of attention to
athletics until last year, when he
astonished everyone by winning
the 220 hurdle in the intercollegi
ate field-day. His time, 27 3-5,
was not very good, but it was a
bad day and he was not pressed;
since then he has never been in
competition outside the University,
and it is impossible to say what he

can do against the great Torrey.
Reynolds will also be entered in the
120 hurdles for which he has never
trained before this year.
C. S. Dole, '98, made the college
record of 10 feet inches for the
pole vault. He is also a good
high jumper, and in hurdling is
close up to Reynolds. Ileishandi
capped by a sore heel, but will
doubtless make a good showing to
morrow, as he is always good in
compet it ion.
B. F. Wilbur, '99, will represent
us in the weights. His work is too
well known to need much comment
here. For the past two years he
has held the Coast championship in
the shot-put, and he is improving
all the time. He has lately shown
excellent form in the hammer
throw.
Chas. Frazier, '98, our best bi
cyclist, is an experienced and able
rider. He broke the intercollegiate
record last year, and would, if in
form, stand an excellent chance in
this year's games. Unfortunately
he has been unable to train sys
tematically, so that it is impossible
to tell how well he will do tomor
row.
C. M. Fiekert, '98, the husky
Varsity captain, George Hazzard,
'96, and F. S. Fisher, '98, together
with Wilbur will take care of the
weights. Fiekert and Hazzard are
throwing about one hundred and
thirty feet. Hazzard can undoubt
edly throw the farthest of any of
the hammer squad, hut he is un
certain in competition. Fiekert, on
the other hand, is at his best when
crowded by competitors. Fisher is
a new man in the shot-put, but he
has the build for the event, and has
made records of which no beginner
need feel ashamed.
On account of Frazier's poor con
dition, our chances in the bicycle
race will depend largely on Roper,
'96, Seybolt, '97, and Anfenger,'96.
Roper is an experienced man, par
ticularly in road racing, but he has
never had a chance to show what
he could do in an intercollegiate
match. Seybolt is a member of the
San Jose Road Club and has done
good work in competition. This is
Anfenger's first year in racing, hut
he has trained hard and faithfully.
Merle Johnson, '97, holds the
college record of 21 feet 10 inches
for the broad jump, and is likely
to exceed that mark in this year's
field-day.
J. A. Col liver, '96, trained for
the hurdles last year, but he was
not particularly successful in that
event. This year he has turned
his attention to the 220 dash and
the 440 and has done good work.
It is a pity that he graduates this
year, as he is just beginning to
show form in his running. He is
likely to get a place.
F. Wilkinson, gr., is in the mile
walk. He is comparatively inex
perienced, having done little work
before this year, but he is built for
the event and has a great deal of
"sand."
Evans Ilolbrook,'97, is entered
in the 100-yard dash. He has had
considerable experience in this
event and is a quick starter. He
has had some trouble in working
up the necessary wind, but his
finishing powers have greatly im
proved lately.

E. S. Smith, '99, is a green mem
ber who shows great promise. One
season's work is not enough fora
distance runner, so that much can
not be expected of Smith this year,
but he has trained down close to
five minute mark and will cer
tainly make a showing.
