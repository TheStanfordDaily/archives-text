pression through these columns of
the gratitude of the student body
toward the men who have worked
so conscientiously and faithfully
for the glory of the University
our veteran track men. Never did
a team more deserve the support of
the student body which it repre
sented than this year's track team.
In the face of the coolness of a not
over-enthusiastic student body
they have put into the field a good
team, a team which is sure to give
California a close contest, of
which we have 110 cause to be
ashamed. More than this, they
have worked up great interest
amongst our students. This year
there is almost as much interest

taken in the field-day as there has
heen in football.
We are not likely to win this
year. A track team can not he
worked up in a year or two; hut we
are going to give Berkeley a close
ami desperate tight ami come out
with the consciousness that we have
strained every nerve to win. I his
is the spirit that wins games, and
we need only a continuance « »i" this
feeling to put our track athletics
on a par with our football.
