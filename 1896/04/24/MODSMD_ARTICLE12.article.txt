# Old Eli's Favorite Son.
## A 						Revelation of the Romantic and Remarkable Career of Lawrence Bangs, the Famous Yale Athlete. 
### HOWARD FIELDING 
Lawrence had kept his agreement
with Paddy, but he had shaved it down
;i little. It was not an event of the
first rank in which the young man
from the South Cove was to make his
debut. I Jut then, he didn't know that,
and was never likely to find it out. so
it is hard to say he was cheated. Ue
sides. it was a very nice airair, after all
a spread given by the (iamma Delta
:i minor « J reek letter society. It wa
liehl in the handsome residence of Gil
bert Parsons, whose son was the pre:;;
dent of the Yale chapter, and some ol
the bluest blood in New Haven wa;
there.
There was a crush of pretty girls, and
among them was Florence Lome, who
bad e> me down to New Haven on pur
pose to attend. Lawrence had se
lected this affair because he had fell
sure that Florence would not be pres
ent. He was still jealous of Paddy.
it must be admit led that the moment
rhosen tor Paddy's experiment was not
auspicious. The Harvard game was the
great topic of conversation among the
friends of the New Haven college, and

t he name of Larry Hangs did not shine as
brightly as heretofore in the galaxy of
IV me. Hut faddy did not mind that a
hit.
"Wait till I talk to 'em." he said, as
lie sallied forth. "They'll see that I'm
s.ll right.."
Lawrence was too Badly crushed to
care what faddy did in his name except
■ so far as it had to do with Florence
l.orne. As to that he was deeply in
terested, so much so that he waLehud
the Pardons house till the rout broke
up. patrolling the sidewalk before it.

the youthful detective of fiction, lie
had a .slouch hat and a false mustache,
and he imagined that he was prepared
to do something desperate.
Of faddy's advent into society there
is only a word to be said. There is a
strange and grotesque character in iic
i ion which is called the college studei t.
f.y 'Miction" is meant pretty nearly
everything that is written about col
lege life, whether in books or in cur
rent news paragraphs. This character
gets into courts, he assaults -peace
able citizens and always gets the
worst of it; he disturbs the audiences
at theaters: he speaks in a dialect so
lull of .slang that only the polcecan
understand it; in short, he is as
near like the real student as faddy
< >'Toole is.

The character is so strongly fixed in
the public mind that it is very hard for
a real student to do anything* bad
enough to excite remark. Paddy's ec
centricities fitted this character so
nicely that even those who knew Law
rence well did not regard them as ec
traordinary. In fact, Paddy succeeded
much better than Lawrence, for he was
so much more like a real, live college
hoy. Thex*e was a "stand-up feed'
that night, and Paddy supplied the
needs of dozens of girls.
