# The 						Concert Last Evening.
## 
### 
Notwithstanding the pouring
rain and howling wind last night
i the chapel was crowded with an
I appreciative audience drawn
j thither, by the announcement that
the great German tenor Anton
i Schott was to sing. It may he
stated at the outset that those who
were fortunate enough to hear him
were repaid ten fold. The price of
j admission was merely nominal
| compared with the prices which
j generally rule for entertainments
1 of such merit as this.
Anton Schott possesses a voice
1 such as one hears but seldom in a
; lifetime. A voice of vast range
i and volume, but absolutely under
; control of its possessor, capable of
! that modulation which expresses
I every shade in a whole vocal scale,
j The magnificent powers of the
singer were applauded to the echo;
j each solo brought out more dis
tinctly the true merit of Anton
j Schott and his preeminence as an
artist.
His renditions were appreciated
by the auditors, who applauded him
to the echo and were repaid bv
several encores which Mr. Schott
kindly answered.
All the solos were sung in the
German tongue with two exceptions.
| "The Death of Charles the Fifth"
was sung in English, as was an en
core to "Lohengrin's Farewell."
Mr. Arthur Fickenscher is a
j pianist of no mean ability and his
exhibition last evening gave the
J program a very agreeable variety.
