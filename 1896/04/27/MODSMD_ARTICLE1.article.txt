## Stanford Surprises California. The 						'96 Field-Day A Tie. 
### 
It was a great afternoon for Stan
ford. Enthusiasts went up to San
Francisco fully expecting defeat;
they returned exultant, for with
luck hadly against Stanford ath
letes they had tied the score with
the redoubtable champions of the
Western League.
From the very first event every
one knew that it was to be a close
match. The score alternated up
and down, Stanford first leading
by a few points, and then Berkeley.
As the games drew to a close it be
came apparent that it was any
body's match. When the 220-yard
dash brought Stanford seven points
and the score stood 58 to 51 in
Stanford's favor, the excitement be
came intense, for upon the ham
mer throw, the only remaining
event, depended the match. The
mighty Edgren was entered and
that practically meant first place
for Berkeley. To tie the score
Stanford must win second and
third place. An ounce of muscle
or an inch of spring more or less
might mean victory or defeat for
Stanford. The big fellows stripped
and began throwing. Edgren soon
ran the score up to 18G feet <> inches.
Mazzard soon reached 126 feet,
thereby securing second place; and
when Wilbur, after two foul throws,
succeeded in beating 1 Dorn's best
throw, two hundred wearers of the
cardinal piled over the fence,
caught up Wilbur, lavender tights
and all, and carried him around in
triumph.
Two pieces of most unfortunate
luck took away Stanford's chances
of winning. The first occurred in
the high hurdles. Torrey had
drawn away from the bunch at the
first, but at the fourth hurdle Rey
nolds caught him and was leading
a few inches at the fifth. There
one of Reynold's spikes caught on
the hurdle, and he pitched over
into the sixth hurdle hopelessly out
of the race. It looked like Rey
nold's race before he fell, and he
should certainly have taken second
place. The other piece of misfor
tune came in the two-mile bicycle
race where Frazier, on whom we
mainly depended, struck his pedal
on the ground as he was rounding
the turn in the tenth lap and fell
heavily, badly injuring his machine.
(Jushing of Berkeley was just be
hind Frazier at the time of the
smash-up, but he put on some ex
tra force and passed entirely over
the wreck.
The sensational races of the day
were the 220 dash and the low hur
dles. The former was run in rec
ord breaking time and was nip ami
tuck until the last hundred yards,
when Bernhard and Brunt on drew
away and won from Dickie by
many yards. In the finals of the
low hurdles Torrey and Reynolds
ran neck and neck up to the last
hurdle when the U. C. man drew
away and won by a few inches.
The time was 2<> seconds fiat, a re
markable record when the cold day

and soggy track are taken into con
sideration.
Dole surprised us twice, first by
losing the pole vault and then by
winning the high jump against
Koch and Miller. In the finals of
the low hurdles he took a cramp
when rounding the turn, but
pluckilv hopped through the course
(Hi his sound leg and saved a third
place.
Brunton won fourteen points, the
highest individual score. Con
sidering the day and the number
of events in which he entered his
work was nothing less than phe
nomenal. Bernhard scored ten
points, reducing the record in the
220-yard dash to 28 1-5 and tying
Seroggin's record of 10 1-5 for the
shorter sprint.
In spite of the prophecy "No rec
ords will be broken," seven Coast
intercollegiate marks went by the
board. The shot put, the pole
vault, the 220 dash, the mile run,
and both hurdles. Stanford took
three of these records and Berkeley
four.
The day was cold, the track
soggy, the crowd large. For once
Stanford showed up better in
cheering than the blue and gold
wearers. Cardinal enthusiasm, es
pecially toward the end, exceeded
anything of the kind ever seen in
this region, even at a football game
