when he appeared with about forty
plates piled on his right arra as he had
seen the waiters in South Cove restau

plauded. It was the hit of the even
ing. and did much to retrieve the honor
lost at Cambridge. Also in a moment
of inadvertence when he forgot that
his name was no longer O'Toole he as

Ireland and thereby added the only
luster that the name of Hangs had

promise again and again to retrieve
the awful disgrace of the Cambridge

"Ik- your true self always," replied
Florence, "for my sake."
CHAPTER XI.
I.A WHENCE MAKES MIS CHOICE.
There was one person who was not
deceived by Larry Langs" appearance
in Paddy's place on the occasion of the
Harvard game. Harry Langs knew
what was up before the first inning was
over. From that moment he was the
most interested spectator, as one may
easily believe. 11 o did not betray to
either of the guilty persons the fact
that he had detected their treason to
the university until about a week after
the event.
Then, late one evening, he entered
Lawrence's room, wearing upon his
countenance an expression appropriate
to a person who has a painful duty to
perforin, and intends to divide tlie mis
ery liberally with the other party to
the interview. The student had not
been seen to smile since his return
from Cambridge. On the evening in
question, he had pushed away his
books, and was sitting with his head
i i his hands. His attitude snggi-su'-..
the last few moments of an ill- punt
life.
liarry regarded him fora minute in
f ■.ilep.ee. Then, with an evident strug
gle to be calm, he said:
"Larry, why didn't you tell me that
_\ ■ u wanted to play bail?"
So the murder was out. Lawrence
looked up fit his brother with an cx
|>:v ion which may have been quite
common in the dungeons of theinquisi
t i'>n.
"Don't." he groaned. "Why should
you make me more miserable than 1
am? When did you find this out?"
"Within five minutes after the game
began."
"" hy have you waited so long? Why
di«.. you descend upon me in your

wrath as soon as 1 got back to New
Haven?"
"Wait one minute for your answer.
I have a question which should go be
fore it. What are you going to do
about it?"
"Nothing. It's all over. 1 have
failed."
"That's your final word on the sub
ject?"
"It is."
"Then you have failed. Look here.
Larry, when 1 discovered you in the
box at Cambridge I was delighted. Of
course it was a mistake for you to start
in with such an important game. Hut
1 forgave you. Only a born athlete eun
know enough to begin at the bottom
and work up. A bookworm and a
dreamvr like you would naturally want
to succeed by a special dispensation of
Providence and not by his own endeav
ors. Hut the athlete understands work,
lie knows that in order to be what he
wishes to be he must make himself
that thing. Look at the men who have
succeeded. .There's Lanky Pierce, the
short distance runner. 1 give you my
word that when he first got the idea
that there was a sprinter concealed in
side of him somewhere, he couldn't run
fast enough to keep even with his own
shadow. He didn't win a heat until his
junior year, but he kept at it. Now
he's in the law school, and he's a ten
second man at a hundred yards and a
sure counter for Vale in the intercol
legiate games.
