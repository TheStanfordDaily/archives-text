Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Since giving notice of my pro
posed amendments in regard to
sweaters, 1 have examined the con
stitution granted to the Women's
Athletic Association by the Ex
ecutive Committee during my presi
dency and I find the following:
Art. 11. Sec. 1. Hoard of Di
rectors (<>) above association) shall
have general supervision and con
trol of athletic affairs, entire con
trol of the raising of money for ath
letic purposes, and power to ap
point all standing committees.
Under this clause. I think the
women can settle their own sweater
question and are also free from any
interference by Student Body of
ficers in executive and financial
mat ters.
Mv original motion to amend
will not be prosecuted.
Respectfully,
E. It. Ziox.
