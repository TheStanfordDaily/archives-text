# About Those Hammers
## 
### 
After the hammer-throw on Sat
| urday several Berkeley men de
clared that the 16-pound hammer
j used by our team was under weight.
| Accordingly both hammers were
' weighed and Edgren's was found to
! be seven ounces light and the Stan
i ford hammer was slightly in excess
!of sixteen pounds. All the throws
of our men were made with the
Stanford hammer, consequently the
chagrin of the Berkeley athletes
may well be imagined. Edgren's
record of 186 feet 6 inches does not
stand as a record. But as there
was some confusion of the hammers
in throwing the standing was not
i altered.
