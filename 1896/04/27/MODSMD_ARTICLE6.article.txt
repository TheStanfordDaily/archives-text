# Clipping's From Our Friends.

Ever since the suit was settled
in our favor the college papers of
the land have nearly all contained
j editorials expressing their gratifica
! tion over the result. Such wide
land hearty expressions of good
i will show how highly Stanford Uni
versity is esteemed throughout the
land, and that" the University holds
' a recognized place among the great
j universities.
Following are some of the clip
j pings:
"Friends of higher education all
| over the land can not but be sin
! cerely glad over the good fortune of
i Leland Stanford University in hav-
I ing the vast endowment of ex
| Senator Stanford finally secured t<>
I it. The case has now been tried
I three times, and the action of the
j United States Supreme Court in
awarding the $15,000,000 to Mrs.
Stanford is final. Stanford Uni
versity has been regarded every
where as one of the hest endowed
| institutions in the world, but the
fact is that during the trial of this
long-drawn-out case the college
has been rather straitened for
funds. Most of the estate left to it
was in the shape of vast vineyards,
which yield a slow return. But
Mrs. Stanford announces her inten-
J tion of devoting this new sum to
the pressing needs of the Univer-
S sity, and to advancing its work, so
! that the cause of education will be
vastly benefited." — Pennsylvania
| Gazette.
"The recent decision of the Su
j prerne Court has saved the Stan
ford University from possible ca
j lamity. The Government brought
! suit against the Stanford estate,
demanding that $15,000,000 be
| turned over to it on account of the
! Central Pacific Railroad construc
j tion business. The Government
j had a very weak case from a legal
point of view, and the suit
! probably would not have been
j brought but for popular clamor on
j the Pacific Coast." —Yale Alumni
! Weekly.
"The Daily Palo Ai/ioof Stan
| ford University printed a six-page
j number in cardinal, the University
color, to celebrate the decision of
! the Supreme Court which has
finally settled the long struggle in
favor of Mrs. Stanford. It will be
remembered that there was great
danger, fora time, of the loss of
the Stanford fortune because of a
! suit brought by the United States
I Government, but it is now
thoroughly secure and Stanford
University has nothing left to
hinder its development. After the
brave tight made by Mrs. Stanford
for the interests of others, she and
the institution she has saved are
worthy <>112 most sincere congratula
tions." — Ini versify of Michigan
