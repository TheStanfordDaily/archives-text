That adage which makes laugh
ter akin to tears received confirma
tion Saturday, when following the
track victory Stanford was given
an adverse decision in the intercol
legiate debate. There is no cause
whatever for complaint in regard to
our men. They made a showing
we may all feel proud of. and had |
the decision been rendered fairly on i
weight of argument and facts ad
vanced Stanford would have been
the victor. It must not be forgot
ten, however, that the language'
used, the appearance and grace of j
the speakers, and evidently the
method of parting the hair, has!
much weight with many decisions.
Id the latter requisites we must ad-J
mit that Berkeley had the advan-j
tage. Her trio was very strong and i
made their points clearly, their ar-1
guments were specious and plausi-j
ble, ours were substantial and logi-;
cal.
From defeat, however, Stanford |
must learn to make greater effort,
that in coming debates her tri
umphs shall be as decisive over her j
rival as it is in most other branches!
of competition.
