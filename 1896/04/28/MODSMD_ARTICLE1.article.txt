# The
						Intercollegiate Debate.
## 
### 
A large audience gathered in
Metropolitan llall last Saturday
evening to hear the rival men from
Berkeley and Stanford battle for
supremacy from the rostrum.
Many distinguished men and
women were in the audience as
partisans either of the cardinal or
I>l ue and gold. It was evident from
the beginning that the Berkeley
students and sympathizers were in
the majority, and they had the ad
vantage of unanimity in their dem
onstrations, having occupied one
entire section. The Stanford part
of the audience was scattered and
its encouraging veils and applause
though ineffective were enthusiastic
and would undoubtedly have pre
dominated as at the lield-day had
it been collected.
The Berkeley team of debaters
was composed <>112 .Joseph O'Connor,
Francis Herbert Dam, and Martin
Charles Flaherty; and Stanford
was represented by her Cathcart,
Boss, and Sheldon. Dr. .Jordan
presided and introduced the speak
ers. The contest was judged by
Hon. .Joseph McKenna, Hon.WWW
Morrow, and Hon. Warren Olncy.
The men who talked for the car
dinal, although defeated, are de
serving of great credit, and have
the congratulation of many others
besides the unanimous student
body for their noble effort.
The California team was perhaps
the strongest ever sent from U. C.
It was composed entirely of sen
iors and well qualified to represent
its university. The Berkeley trio
possessed better facilities and ad
vantages in preparation than
Stanford's team from the fact
that they are nearer the
city libraries and were excused
from university wyrk some time
before the debate; but these circum
stances do not detract from the ex
cellence of their work.
Arthur M. Cathcart, the first
speaker for Stanford, is a veteran
in CDiversity debating, having de
voted much of his time to'it at the
University and having represented
her in the Intercollegiate before.
His style is plain and straight
to the point. He showed him
self to be a quick logical
thinker and a forcible speaker. In
his opening for the affirmative he
clearly and consistently stated
tenets and adduced many able
arguments in support of them.
Mr. Cathcart gave particular em
phasis to the correct effects of the
present system of election <>t' sen
ators by state legislatures, vividly
sketched a political caucus in act ion.
with all its se.heininga ltd corruption,
and concluded by showing how the
present system and its creation, the
Senate, were causing distrust of the
Government by the people. Mr.
Cathcart then established his sys
tem and in comparison showed in
what respects it was superior to the
present one.
Joseph O'Connor followed for the
negative and in an able argument
met many of the points adduced by
Cathcart. His main effort, how
ever. was directed not to refutation
of the previous speaker so much as
the advancement of new grounds to
show that llie system proposed by
the affirmative tended toward cen
tralization. Mr. O'Connor pointed

i at all the dangers of centralization,
and made an exhaustive compari
son of the existing with the pro- 1
posed system. Helms a convinc
ing air and is a skillful speaker. J
.J. M. Boss then took the floor
| for the affirmative. He produced
evidence to show the expensiveness I
lof the present svsU-mu in electing
: Senators, and showed how the State ;
| often paid the expenses of a whole I
j session ol ;h( legislature which did
no other business than elect a Sen-!
I ator and sometimes failed to do
I that. He cited many specific cases j
' to show deadlocks in the election of
Senators, and the immense cost to
i the people. Mr. Boss also showed'
! the dangerous tendency toward the
abolition of State sovereignty]
i and the identification of State
with National interests by
tht! present mode of election.
Mr. Francis Herbert Dam fol
lowed for the U. C. Mr. Dam is
|an acute thinker and a composed
i and polished speaker. Dam at
tempted to show the fallacy of the!
| argument made by Boss that the!
j new mode of election would exclude
from the Senate men who attained
I the position through their riches.
By an accurate line of reasoning
! he traced the operation of corruptive
forces through the new system and'
showed the same result would pre-i
vail under existing conditions.
Henry D. Sheldon now came for
ward for the affirmative. Mr.
I Sheldon was without doubt the
j most logical speaker of the evening
He thinks and speaks ably without
I effort, and is especially forcible in I
; refutat ion, which calls for extempor
aneous work. Sheldon laid about
him with great effect and demol
ished many of the arguments of the
I preceding negative speakers. He,
| dissected sound looking arguments j
and showed them to be fallacies, j
i The latter part of bis speech was!
directed to the support of his .col-'
| leagues, whose grounds he rehearsed
land established in an able manner. I
The last speaker of the negative,!
Mr. Martin Charles Flaherty, was
j accounted Berkeley's best man, but
lowing to illness he was in no con
dition to debate. W hen well the]
I'oruin is his element. He has a
i natural style and is a plain but
strong speaker. lle endeavored to
j show the inability of the aflinna-j
tive to locate the evils of the pres-!
lent system. He said that the af
firmative had illogically compared
the ideal of direct election with the |
1 perversions of the indirect system,]
instead of the ideal direct with the
perverted direct system. lie in
sisted that the affirmative must I
show that legislatures elected in
non-senatorial years are more j
t rust wort by than t hose chosen when
Senators are to be elected.
Cathcart had reserved hisclosing
argument to refute the points ad
duced by Flaherty, but his closing
! argument did not seem smooth]
and so lost a great deal of its force. l
The limited time of ten minutes j
cut him short when he had many
arguments yet to answer.
Judges McKenna, Morrow, and
Olncy after about fifteen minutes
deliberation decided to award the
victory to the State I'niversity.
: In announcing the decision Judge
McKenna paid many compliments
to the speakers.
