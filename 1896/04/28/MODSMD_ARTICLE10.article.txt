The large expense which it seems
the Senior Class intends to lay out
on entertainments during Com
mencement Week recalls to mind
the lavish outlay made fora similar
purpose last year by the Class of
'Do. Doubtless the Class of '96 will
attempt to eclipse this supreme ef
fort of the "Pioneers" and to fur
nish something unwitnessed here
before, but in so doing they should
be careful to leave no unsettled
Class debt behind them, thus excel
ling their illustrious predecessor in
that respect. The tendency on the
part of college organizations to con
tract debts which in all probability
will never meet payment seems to
be a growing one here. It is not
confined strictly to one club or as
sociation but is disseminated
mainly throughout the four class
organizations, and as such consti
tutes an increasing and threatening
danger to the University. It is
safe to say that there is not one
class among the four which is not
burdened with a debt of this char
acter, and which is making no
efforts whatever to relieve itself of
the liability. In fact the classes
maintain an air of utter indiffer
ence as to whether their debts are
settled or not, seeming to regard it
as a matter of no importance what
ever, scarce once taking into consid
eration that aside from the stitrma
cast upon themselves, it is not their
reputation as individuals or even
as classes which is at stake, but
that of the University, which should
be much nearer and dearer to them.
The business man who has a claim
against one of the different class

organizations does not stop to con
sider which one of the organizations
it is that owes him the money; he
charges it up to the University, and
the name and standing of the col
lege suffer accordingly in his esti
mation.
It can he readily seen that the
cause of all this lies in the oppor
tunities for reckless and irresponsi
ble deht-making on the part of the
class officials; and it is here that
the remedy must be applied. If no
other method can be devised it
would be well to treat these differ
ent officers in the same way as the
treasurer of the Student Body and
the business managers of the stu
dent publications are treated, name
ly, put them under bonds and make
them personally responsible for all
debts contracted by their respective
classes. If such a plan had no
other merit it would at least result
in putting a stop to this indiscrimi
nate multiplication of reckless obli
gations.
