## A
						Revelation of the Romantic and Remarkable Career of Lawrence Bangs, the Famous Yale Athlete. 
### HOWARD FIELDING 
Corvrlpht, 1804.

"Then; are men who tr} r for the
team!-, every year there in college and
never make them, Yet they're a help
to the college and they Know it. Their
examples spur on better men than
themselves, ami their pi nek and perse
veranee play and win many a game,
though their mortal parts are
sitting on the benches, obscure
and unnoticed. That's what it is to
bo an athlete. That's why ath
letics benefit a college. The spectacle
of one of these men who is forever
trying and falling short, and cheering
the fellow who gets the place he him
s If was after, is worth coming to col
lege for. And any man who comes
may see not one but hundreds in the
lour years of his life when a good ex
ample is most beneiicial to him.
"And so. Larry. I wasn't so much
grieved when the Harvard boys took
your scalp. I waited to see what yon
would do. I've suffered more than you
have in the last week. When 1 saw
you give up without an effort. I put on
sack cloth and ashes and ivnded my
garments. This is the last call. Larry.
What are you going to do about it?"'
"Nothing." replied Lawrence, mood
ily. "I begin to perceive that sport is
not satisfying. 1 shall conline myself
in future to intellectual struggles."
"In short, you will play for yourself
and not for the university. Von desire
a personal triumph, and you don't care
what beco, .■> of your college. And
y >ur name is llangs. Well, well! The
laws of heredity work some of the
time, but when they take a day <>11
there's no telling what may happen."
And that was the end of it. The
ps'rt.s were never changed again, in such
a way as to be detrimental to the best
interests of the college.
To trace the subsequent career of
"Larry Langs" on the athletic Held
would be merely to repeat what ever\
well-informed person should know.
That the name of Lawrence Lang:
stood always at the head of t he rink lit
of his class is a in:; tier of no importance,
yet it may as well be mentioned here,
si nee the fact could not otherwise
reach the eyes of the public. Mere
signed not only the higher lit • of nodily
endeavor to Paddy (>'Toole. but also the
trivialities of social int.-ivouiv-e. In
fact, for purposes of such narration as
this or the glorious traditions of the
university, the real Lawrence Langs
ceased to e\ist, at the close of the sec
ond Harvard game in his freshman
year.
lie might profitably be dismissed at
this point, had he not figured in a
series of events, the first of which was
witnessed by thousands, some of whom
may be interested to learn what fol
lowed. Nobody can have forgotten the
extraordinary success of the alleged
Larry Langs on the football field. liis
triumphs there were second only to
those which he scored upon the green

1 diamond. Perhaps the greatest of them
was the last.
The llarvard-Yale football game in
Larry's senior year was a bloody and
desperate struggle. The Harvard team
that year was entirely made up of
heavy-weight pugilists of the first
rank. It was said that they were
trained on a diet of raw meat and
warm blood. The game which resulted
was one of the most entertaining ath
letic exhibitions ever presented to the
■raze of the firs 4 families of America.
Lvcry time the referee winked some
body was knocked down, and by the
end of the first half Harvard had
scored eleven black eyes. lint a Yale
man always plays with an eye single to
, the interests of his college, and there
fore the mere fact that the other eye is
closed up docs not destroy his useful
ness. So it happened that while the
Harvard team would have taken a bet
ter photograph at the close of the first
J half the Yale eleven looked the like
lier to uin. when viewed by an expert.
It must be confessed, however, that
upon the feminine part of the vast sur
rounding throng Harvard had made
! a very deep impression. Nothing so
perfectly lovely as "Buck" llalford's
| slugging had ever been seen before,
and his hcadwork was simply marvel
: ous. lie seemed to know by secret su
{ pernatural means when the referee was
i looking at somebody else, and the man
who played opposite him could not
j have been identified by a coroner's jury
composed of his immediate relatives
after play had been in progress twenty
minutes. His face looked more like a
strawberry shortcake than it did like
any recognized type of human coun
tenance; yet "Luck" had accomplished
it all without so much as a warning
from the referee. It is no wonder the
girls thought him clever. Even Flor
ence Lome admitted that, but she al
ways added, hopefully: ".lust wait
till Larry Langs gets hold of him."
