We are philosophizing in Berk
eley nowadays on tlie cause for our
defeat in baseball generally and in
the last game in particular. We
thought we had a pretty good team,
the best in years, and we think so
yet —"if it hadn't been for that tifth
inning, yon know, and if Wheeler
had only held out," etc. etc., is the
way it goes. Hut really baseball
stands more firmly this year than
il has for live or six years, and it is
the wonder of the old students that
anybody should even know where
the diamond ought to be. And
eyerybody, in short, feels we have
a chance in the next games any
way.
1 he heart of the average junior
and under-class man is made happy
this week. By what, do you sup
pose? By the rain. The rain has
knocked out both drills this week
—and indeed an unusually large
number throughout the term. The
average student would rejoice to see
a continual flood, if only thereby
he might get out of drilling. It's a
bad outlook for "Bourdon" though,
for the time honored burial of
Bourdon and Minto is- scheduled
for tonight; and at the moment of
writing it is near a cloud-burst out
side. The freshmen have been
making great preparations, likewise
the sophs. It looks as though the
old custom, which has languished
since '96's memorable celebration,
might be viewed in all its formee
vigor, despite the prophesies of its
early passing away. The fresliies'
catafalque is said to be begirt with
barbed wire, a new departure which
would make old classes turn in
their humane and respectable
graves. The sophs have dug out
all possible handcuffs, hay rope,
and nippers and other torniento.
'9t> will be on hand to give sage
counsel how to use them. The
juniors have a big score to settle
with "98 and hence will see that' 99
lacks no advice or rope. But the
rain, how about the rain?
This if the last week before the
ex's. Today the faculty meets, it
is said, to pass on credentials for
degrees. Probably very few seniors
will be turned down, and not a few
will gel their diplomas after only
three years.
The feeling is strong that this
coining Intercollegiate Field-day
will not end in a 8-1 score and
that it is better it should not. "Of
course we are sure of winning, but
the closer the rivalry the better."
We feel less sure of the debate, but
if hard work goes for anything we
stand a good chance. Saturday is
also the day for the appearance of
'97's "Blue and Gold." It ought
to be a first-class one considering
the kind of editorial staff it has,
but its character may be somewhat
changed from former years owing
to the advent of Josh.
