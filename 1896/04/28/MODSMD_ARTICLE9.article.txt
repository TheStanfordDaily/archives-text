The baseball men are to be com
mended for their prompt return to
work after the decisive defeat of the
Berkeley representatives on last
Wednesday. Such energy shows
that our team is out to win this
year and that the first taste of vic
tory has not turned its head. With
the few remaining days yet left for
practice, and with our players all
in their accustomed good condition,
the lesson of last week ought to be
repeated next Saturday afternoon,
only perhaps in considerably aug
mented doses.
