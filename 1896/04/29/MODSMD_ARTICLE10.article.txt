In order to make a good showing
on Stanford Day at the San Jose
Itose Carniva 1 some plans should
he adopted at once for getting spec
ial rates, and for urging as many
students as possible to attend the
celebration on that day.
The San .lose people have shown
every desire to give Stanford every
possible means for making a good
showing and their courtesy should
meet with the expressed apprecia
tion of all the students.
It has been suggested, and the
idea seems a good and feasible one,
that all who attend the Carnival
from the I*Diversity should display
an abundance of the Stanford color.
This can be made most effective by
adopting some such scheme as that
followed by the members of the
Musical Club in their recent trip,
viz., uniform straw hats with car
dinal bands. This matter should
be given immediate attention, for
but a little more than a week re
mains before the arrival of Stanford
Day.
