# Old Eli's Favorite Son.
## A
						Revelation of the Romantic and Remarkable Career of Lawrence Bangs, the Famous Yale Athlete. 
### HOWARD FIELDING 
Yale had borne the assault of her
enemy remarkably well. Only one
man had been permanently retired
from t lie game, and he had been re
stored to consciousness by his own la
ther. who was a celebrated surgeon
and one of the most interested specta
tors of the struggle.
In the midst of this animated scene
l'addy O'Toole had been a conspicuous
liguiv. lie was unquestionably the
best running halfback on any college
team. When the ball was with the
blue, and ground had to be gained,
l'addy got the signal, and in almost
every ease it was discovered, after the
other twenty-one men had been re
moved from his prostrate form, that he
had scored the necessary advance. In
this wav he accumulated courtplaster
and glory, till the latter encircled his
head like a halo and the former cov
ered his face like a mask.
He was the man whom Harvard
feared most, and in the fifteen minutes'
interval while the crimson eleven were
having their knuckle bones put back
into place by a competent surgeon his
doom was sealed. Hy great good
fortune and the most marvelous endur
ance he succeeded in staving oft' the in
evitable for fully thirty minutes of the
t econd hal 112. Neither side had scored.
Yale had pushed the ball to Harvard's
ten yard line, and still retained it. A
mass play advanced it three yards
more.
It was decided to send Paddy be
tween right guard anil tackle for
the remaining distance. Nobody
who saw that play will ever forget it.
Everybody was in it. Even the ex
peri> among the spectators could not
tell what had happened. They knew
that, a big gain had been made, but it
was impossible to disentangle the run
ner from the mass of struggling giants.
For the first tune in her athl -tie ex
perience Florence was frightened.
She was certain that she saw one of
her lover's legs at a distance of three
yards from the spot where his body
lay. Hut .... that spot was over the
line and 1 lorenre was true * Inc. she
breathed a prayer that Larry s body
might be there, and 1 lie leat In r spheioxi

and a leg more or less counts nothing

The referee approached and succeeded
in persuading several men to get off

the top of the heap. Then, with the
aid of his cane as a lever, he removed
such as could not perform that oflice
for themselves. At the bottom la\
l'addy O'Toole still clasping the ball,
and it was six inches over the line!
It seemed at first that l'addy had
"gone over the line."too. but the medi
cal and surgical corps succeeded in re
taining him on this side. A decision on
this point, however, was not reached
in time for l'addy to proceed with the
.game. His loss seriously weakened
the ranks of the blue. They were
pushed back foot by foot, the ball wa>
was within three \..rds of their goat
line and in Harvard's possession when
time was called.
Hut the game was won. and the
nam.- of Harry Hangs—so familiar to
l'addy that lie had nearly forgotten
his own—once more arose until it
seemed to echo hack from the skv.
