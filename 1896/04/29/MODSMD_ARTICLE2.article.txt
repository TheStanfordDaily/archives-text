Editor Daily Palo Alto:
There is no characteristic of the
Daily Palo Alto which better en
titles it to be regarded as the repre
sentative of the University than the
readiness with which it opens its
columns to the support of a 113* proj
ect of really general interest to the
University. All through the year
plans and undertakings of all kinds
crowd upon us for attention; they
claim, and generally receive, con
sideration from students and fac
ulty. One organization has not
perhaps been the object of much
attention outside of its own mem
bership. I refer to the Choral So
ciety.
As a matter of fact, after the
Choral Society was organized, with
a very respectable number of mem
bers, the officers of the society felt
that the Chorus had better go to
work, and be sure that it could do
something deserving, before asking
the support of the University at
large. The time has come when
the society needs and may right
fully expect that support.
When the plan of organizing a
chorus here was broached, it met
with discouragement from nearly

everybody who knew the temper of
the students in regard to music.
At the time of the organization of
the society even those few who
might have joined it were pledged
to give their energies to the (ilee
Club and the Opera. Obviously,!
if the Chorus were to succeed, itj
could do so only by appealing to
the latent interest in music among!
the students. Those of us who
were in the movement at the be
ginning have been surprised at the!
result of the undertaking entered
upon with so much hesitation.
The Chorus has a regular attend
ance of over a hundred members.
Hut the members do not mean so
much as does the effect of the prac
tice upon the singers themselves.
There lias been a steady increase in
accuracy of intonation; in sense of
rhythm; and, a remarkable thing
in a chorus, in purity and beauty!
of tone. In a word, the Chorus is
a source of musical education. Be
yond all, it has opened the gates of
the kingdom of music to many who
without the Chorus would never;
have entered tin in.
The exclusively intellectual and
analytic tendency of our higher j
education needs to be corrected b\'!
something which calls into expres- j
sion warm and noble feelings.!
This element is supplied by the!
practice of music, and especially of
choral music. For myself, 1 look
from one Wednesday to the next as
from the best part of one week to
the best part of another; and I be
lieve iny experience is that of many j
members.
Less important than this funda
mental success, are the material
achievements of the Choral Society.
Very fortunately for us, there was
going begging in San Francisco at
the time of our organization the
library of an extinct ora
torio society, containing enough
standard music to keep a
large chorus supplied, except for
the occasional purchase of modern
works, forever, or till the pages of
the nooks were worn out from use.
This library has been given out
right to the University. The cost
of the hooks new —and they are as
good as new —would be at least live
thousand dollars.
This is the lirst thing the Chorus
did. It then began the purchase
on installments of the grand piano
now in the chapel. When this is
paid for it will belong to the Uni
versity.
This is the second achievement
of the Chorus. The third will be
the concert given May 22, the prof
its of which will be devoted to
making up the balance due from
the Chorus because of the purchase
of the piano and library. A chorus
costs a good deal. The salaries of
the director and the accompanist,
generous as these gentlemen have
been, the incidental expenses, the
installments on the piano, which
have to be carried through thesuni
nier, and the cost of the books, foot
up to a considerable total. The
running expenses of the society will
always be paid by fees, and the in
come from concerts will be ex
pended for the musical interests of
the University. This year we shall
be content to give a dollar's worth
of music for fifty cents.
The program of the concert will

be made known later. This at
least I may now say: the society
will sing a number of the most de
servedly famous oratorio choruses!
and part songs with correct phras
ing, with a tine quality of tone, and j
with an intelligent interpretation.
To the great majority of us here J
the music will be new. Musical
auditors will hear noble music sin-;
cerely interpreted; auditors who!
are not musical will learn how at
tractive and interesting great
music may be. The music of the;
oratorios is simple and noble.
It should be understood that the j
Chorus is really a University organ
ization. It exists in and for the
University, grateful as we are for
the help given us by friends from
outside. The glory of the Choral
Society will be the glory of the
University. We ought to have five
hundred members. As it is the
society is perhaps the largest Uni
versity organization with a special
aim, excepting of course scientific
societies. The principle of its or
ganization makes it truly repre
sentative. To be better than some
body else in athletics usually
means crowding the other man off
the team; to be better in music is
to crowd him off the (ilee Club or
Mandolin Club; but in the Chorus
for you to be better helps the other
man on. Thus the spirit of the
Chorus can be but one of mutual
assistance.
The officers of the society have
shown unselfish devotion. When
the books came from the city Mr.
Peck, the librarian, and Mr. Greg
ory, the chairman of the executive
committee, unpacked them and
toiled up the library stairs to put
them on the shelves, a hard day's
work. Mr. Peck and his assistants
have wheeled great loads of books
back and forth on a barrow, and
taken (he time necessary to num
ber and stamp every volume in the
library. The same spirit has been
shown by the Executive Committee,
Mr. Gregory, Miss Wight, and Mr.
Neidig, who have not spared time
and strength to make the work of
the society successful and easy.
The whole Chorus shares this loy
alty. We have worked faithfully
and regularly, without meanness
or jealousy, in the pure love of mu
sic. We have taken our scoldings
meekly, and have practised as much
as we could.
We now claim the support of the
University at large. On the result
of the semester's experiment de
pends the future of choral music
here. If the concert is not an ar
tistic and financial success, this,
almost if not quite the most import
ant activity in the University out
side of the University work itself,
will receive a staggering blow. We,
the Chorus, will do our best to make
it an art istic success—we appeal for
support and sympathy to Stanford
loyalty, a loyalty which has never
yet failed when called upon.
11. B. Lathuop,
Vice-President Choral Society.
