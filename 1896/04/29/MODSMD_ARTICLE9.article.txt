W'ifi dislike entering further into
the controversy concerning the em
blems of the various Varsity teams,
hut nevertheless it seems a little ir
regular to permit any and every
athlete who goes up to contest in
an intercollegiate field-dav to wear
the cardinal "S" on his jersey. It
is a universal custom in other l*ni
versities to permit only those men
who have won places in a former
meet to wear the college enihlem,
all others heing distinguished by
the letters"A. A." worn on each
side of the larger letter. In view
of this general custom, it would
seem wise to introduce the plan
here.
