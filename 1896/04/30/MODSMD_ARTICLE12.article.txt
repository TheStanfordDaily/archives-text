On Saturday we shall have the
pleasure of receiving the Berkeley
baseball nine on our own diamond.
This will be the second game of the
series, and is sure to be watched
with interest. We have the lead
for the baseball championship and
should be able to keep it. This
year has seen, on the whole, an in
fusion of new confidence and zeal
into the athletic circles of Stanford
IJniversisy. Last Saturday's track
events have but whetted our appe
tite for further success. Saturday's
game should go in our favor. We
have defeated Berkeley on their own
ground; we ought to be able to
defeat them on ours. Nothing
will conduce more to a victory than
a large attendance on the bleach
ers. Let every one make it a point
to get out and ''root" for our nine.
