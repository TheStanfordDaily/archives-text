The results of yesterday's elec
tions are generally accepted
throughout the University as satis
factory. On the whole an aide and
representative body of officers were
chosen to guide the destinies of the
Associated Students during IS9C>- ( J7.
The large vote cast is gratifying in
that it indicates a widespread inter
est in the administration of student
affairs.
The officers who have been chosen
will have many important mat
ters to look after, and a heavy
weight of responsibility will rest
upon their shoulders. The inter
ests of the Associated Students have
never been administered with so
much ability and zeal as during
the current year. In the officers of
1895-9G we have been more than
fortunate. They have made the
student body a living reality. Its
sphere of influence has steadily ex
panded, until now every student in
terest. of any importance comes with
in its scope. To maintain the influ
ence of the Associated Students at its
present high-water mark will re
quire constant watchfulness and
careful administration. I>ut there
is little doubt that the officers in
whom the students have just re
corded their confidence will meet
the exigencies as they arise.
