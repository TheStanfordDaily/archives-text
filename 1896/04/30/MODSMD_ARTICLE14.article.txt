It is a pleasure to report that I'addy
had lK»th his logs with him when ho
was l'onnd. They were, however, of
little immediate use to him. first. Ix*-
« a use he had not strength enough to
move them, and second. because then
were plenty of willing hands ready to
carry him wherever he wished to go.
So great, in fact, was the press, that
liarry Hangs was unable'to reach
Paddy's side until after he had been
iiorne to the coach on which sat old
.loiin bangs weeping tears of pride and
joy.
it was the first time that I'addv had
been subji I to close scrutiny by the
elder Hangs. Ilarry had always dread
ed t he proverbial keenness of a father*!-
eye; and he had successfully schemed
to keep them apart. To a casual ob
server there might have seemed to be
no cause for anxiety in this instance.
Paddy looked more like Hanquo's ghost
than he did like Lawrence, but Law
rence after a similar experience would
have appeared not otherwise, except
that he would have been dead.
Ilarry tried in vain to separate his
father from ''addy: the venerable gen
t leinan was obstinate.
•"He shall go to my house," he de
clared. ' I'm too prowl of him to let
him out of my sight."
So I'addy was taken to Hoston. When
the special from Springfield arrived in
that city. .lohn bangs hurried to his
residence in order to have everything*
ready for the reception of the hero.
The servants were drawn up in the hall
and hurriedly drilled in the Yale cheer,
which they gave in great enthusiasm
when I'addy was led in. The proud old
man advanced to meet the noble youth,
and embraced him gently, for it was
not yet known definitely how many of
his bin, were br >ken. ile was put to
bed. and lour <loctors, at a hundred

him while good < Id mother nature be

stole into the room every half hour to
look at liim. though ii must bo con

After • nt- of these vi-.its Mr. Hangs
descended to the main hall of the
house, and there beheld a spectacle
which was almost too much even for
his iron nerves. Standing by the door
which he had just closed was the real
Lawrence Hangs. Ile had been con
cealed in Poston during the game, of
which he had read an acount in the
evening extras. Having learned that
I'addy had been subjected to rough
usage, he had painted a number of
w unds upon his face and had liberally
decorated it with court piaster. lie
must have been inspired in this work
of art. for it resembled the wreck of
I'addy O'Toolc's features to a nicety.
Of course he supposed that I'addy had

that lie could command no words ex

"It's all up, Lawrence." he said.
"We might as well tell the whole
