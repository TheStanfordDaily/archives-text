# Baseball Saturday.
## 
### 
The second hasehall match of the
intercollegiate championship series
is to be played off on the Stanford
diamond next Saturday, Indoubt
edly this will be by far the best
game played this year on the home
ground. Nothing but a pronounced
attack of "rattles" gave Stanford
the last game, and since then Ber
keley has trained harder than ever.
Her nine is in good condition and
enters with the avowed purpose of
winning.
