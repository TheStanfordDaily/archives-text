Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The debates are now over and
some reflections on the subject seem
to be in order. Whatever we may
think of the decision on Saturday
evening, there was the unmistake
able statement of Judge McKenna
that "gracefulness of delivery" was
considered as an important cle
ment in the decision. This point
seems to have made possible the
decision in favor of Berkeley. The
Carnot medal went to Berkeley on
the same ground, so we may say
that by the decision of the judges
Stanford lost the debates this year
because their debaters lacked the
training necessary t<» give them the
ease and grace required for the best
public, speaking.
Where is the trouble? is it be
cause our debaters refuse to take
advantage of the opportunities to
cultivate that part of their work,
oris it because the opportunities
are not sufficient and not of proper
character?
The whole spirit of Stanford is
against any thing that looks to
ward the so-called old time
oratory. As far as that oratory
was merely flowery language
without thought, we believe it
should be ridiculed; but have we
not done equally bad in going to
the other extreme? 1 n getting a way
from the old system, we have failed
to keep what was good in it. In
our worship of intellect and science
we forget that human beings have

the same feelings and emotions to
be influenced as they had of old.
We omit those very things which
appeal to the sensibilities through
which the judgment may be much
influenced. With the "spread
eagle" oratory we have also cast
away what is necessary to give a
pleasing effect.
Cold logic, however unanswerable,
unadorned by pleasing and easy
delivery, does not win us decisions.
We must have that, and the sooner
we recognize it the better for our
laurels. But how are we to get it?
To a certain extent we can get it by
self-cultivation. But this is not
sufficient. We must have instruc
tion and long ami thorough prac
tice under competent guidance. The
literary societies are organized for
the latter purpose, but not having
had the previous instruction and
not now having the proper guid
ance we can accomplish but little.
It must rest with the English De
partment to furnish these things.
Stanford has reason to be proud of
her English Department, but if we
may be permitted to offer a sugges
tion. it needs some extension. It is
impossible for an otherwise over
busy professor to give the proper
attention to debating, elocution
ary. and oratorical work. We
ought to have a professor who can
devote his time to that special line.
Let him take an interest in the de
bating societies, attending in reg
ular order, and, if the societies so
desire, acting as critic when pres
ent. Let him, to some extent at
least, use the societies as his med
ium of actual practice work. Berke
ley has regular training given all
her debaters, and the}' show the
good effects of it. Can we have a
similar opportunity? If we can, we
have no fear but that the students
will catch the spirit of the move
and show proper support and ap
preciation of efforts to raise our
standard of oratory. Our athletic
victories are not won without much
coaching; how can we expect our
debates to be won without it?
These suggestions are made in the
hope that we may see matters in a
new light and begin now to prepare
fora victory next year. Are we to
continue to be "men of brawn and
men of brains, but not men of
polish"? M. I. E.
