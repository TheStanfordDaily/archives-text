# "The Still Hour."
## 
### 
Prof. A. B. Show delivered the
Sunday sermon, taking for his text
Psalms xlvi, 10: "He still and
know that 1 am God." The dis
course in substance follows:
In the words of the text there is
offered the highest knowledge pos
sible to us —the knowledge of God.
Hut it is offered with a condition,
"He xtill, and know that I am God."
There are states of human spirit
which make the knowing *of God
impossible. There are other states
which invite His presence and fel
lowship. The Psalmist's words
suggest that the "still hour" of life
may bring revelations of God and
truth and duty which the noisier
demands of the world are powerless
to give or take away. In those
supreme experiences when the soul
opens towards the higher influences
and ideals of life, when moments
of deeper insight and nobler aspira
tion fall upon us —in these times,
are provided the conditions which
make possible true knowledge of
God.
The knowledge of God held out
to us in the text is not a mere in
tellectual apprehension of Him.
The noble company of modern
thinkers has done much to estab
lish the rationality of a belief in
(iod Hut philosophical thought
can give us but an abstract, ob
jective divinity, not a Father to
lean upon and love. If (iod is
really known at all, He must be
known by the direct communion of
spirit with spirit. It is only the
confidence of men that they find
(iod in this larger way which gives
them calm and contentment with
reference to the being and charac
ter of (iod. Of all truths none
needs to be pressed home upon the
life of our times as this, that spirit
ual things are spiritually discerned,
and that faith in things invisible
and intangible comes always to
him, and only to him, who seeks it
through living more than through
thinking. When one comes to this
faith and takes firm stand on the
reality of the spiritual life ;ill ways
are open between his life and God.
For the devout heart there is no
place in the universe which may
not become the "still hour" of com
munion with God.
Perhaps for most of us some of
the strongest aspirations for the
life of the spirit come from nature.
You go out under the stars at night,
and in the sublime peace and quiet
of the skies (iod conies near to you,
and you do not find it hard to be
lieve that He is real and cares for
you.
Again, the "still hour" of spirit
ual communion may reach us in
t lie common experiences and rela
tionships of life. Often when our
burdens bear heavily and we
sit down to measure the pos
sible worth of our lives, we come
•to see our work in its larger rela
tions to the life and work of all
men, and, going higher, we see our
little endeavors wrought into the
mighty purposes of God.
In like manner the sweet asso
ciations of human life bring us
glimpses of those higher ties of
which they are fore-gleams As
you enter more and more deeply
into some strong friendship, there
comes to you not only the priceless

compensation of friendship itself,
but a distinct vision of something
beyond. Human love gives a fore
taste of the divine.
When we go on to the yet larger
aspects of human existence the same
necessity of spiritual apprehension
is with us still. As one endeavors
to take into his mental vision the
whole vast sweep of human life
through history, he linds the mag
nitude of the conception almost
overpowering. And yet, as he
stands before the pageant in all its
immensity, lie inevitably asks,
What may it all mean? If he be a
reverent student of history, it will
have no import to him apart from
God. As he contemplates through
all the ages the things that have
befallen the children of men, he
will be lifted strongly towards God,
and lie will enter the still hour of
communion with God.
And finally, on the same grounds,
our religious institutions find their
ample vindication. The great mass
of men and women can not rise to
the thought of God in nature as it
is revealed to the poet, nor can they
interpret the spiritual meaning of
personal relationships. For these
exist our present religious institu
tions. Every one of them has its
place and function in bringing men
up into the life of God. Some do
their work better, some worse, but
all are striving towards the same
ends.
