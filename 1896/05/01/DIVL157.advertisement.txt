BEFORE LONG
All who ride till' bicycle will he wearing,
the Deitnel Linen-Mesh Underwear.
Those who do now are enthusiastic in
praising it.
People who exercise much, such as!
wheelmen, hull players and lovers of |
other kinds of athletic, sport, ought to,
appreciate the invaluable advantages of I
our Linen-Mesh Underwear, which ah- |
sorbs the perspiration and dries quickly, j
hence feels warm and comfortable dur
ing exercise and after; which neither
overheats the body while exercising, nor
chills it w hen at rest, and which never
clings to the body like a wet woolen or
cotton garment. These facts speak for
themselves
.Mr. Lewis Ilerreshoff of Defender
fame, has this to say: "I think the
J>eimel Linen-Mesh should be worn by
all who ride the bicycle: you should lav
far more stress on that."
