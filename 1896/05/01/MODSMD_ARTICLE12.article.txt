It is fortunate for American foot
hall that the various confusing
codes of rules which have so seri
ously hindered the harmonious de
velopment of the game have at
length been unified.
The new code of rides is intended
to embody all that was best in the
three older codes. These three sets
of rules were all more or less ex
perimental, and this year's definite
settlement is an attempt to put the
result of those experiments in defi
nite form.
Evidently the legislators were
perfectly impartial in their at
tempts to purify the game; this is
proven by the latitude allowed of
ficials in judging of momentum
mass plays. We hope that this
unifying of the code will be fol
lowed by a reconciliation of the va
rious warring colleges, and that
harmony will soon again reign over ;
tlie American gridiron.
