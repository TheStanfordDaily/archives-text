The active interest manifested by
the students in this week's contest
is a sufficient warrant that we shall
have nothing to fear from having
turned over to popular election the
important offices in the student
body. Throughout the semester
the campaign has been most vigor
ous, and now at its close we have
had the opportunity of witnessing
the greatest outpouring of student
sentiment that anything short of an
intercollegiate match has produced.
The effect of this should he to j
impress upon the successful ones aj
deep sense of their responsibility to j
student affairs; to make them |
mindful of the confidence imposed i
in them by their fellow-students. I
Kach vote that has been given them j
is an expression of some individ-|
nal's trust, and as such should bei
held inviolable. It is to be regretted '
that a few over-zealous workers
showed a disposition to make the
campaign a personal one and to re-'
sort to unfair methods in order to I
win support. Mud-slinging is of
course never permissible. Among
students it is sadly out of place.
