lie told it with wonderful clearness
and brevity. To paint the father's
grief would require too firm a hand. It
will not lie attempted here. Indeed,
that was a very hard ease. No pride
was ever higher and no humiliation
deeper than John Hangs', lie had be
lieved himself the father of a hero of
the "Speechless Wonder," of "Old Kli's
Favorite Son," and when the mask was
si ripped off, there remained nothing
l>ut a creature of books and rank lists,
not laurel crowned, but with a halo of
stale lump oil smouldering upon the
dark background of obscurity.
It is greatly to John Hanks* credit
that lie was able to stilie all upbraid-
Ligs. and to come at once to the prac
tical consideration of the case.
"I will not burden you with useless
reproaches." he said. "Neither will 1
make hard conditions. There is only
one thing which I insist upon, and that
:s that this deception must cease. It
is not honest. 1 will not have two of
you at Yah-, any longer."
"Hut. father," interposed Harry,
"how can we take Paddy away? It
will simply cripple the nine, and Har
vard ;â–  going to have the same old bat
ting gang next spring."
'"No." replied John Hangs, "the uni
versity cannot spare Paddy, but I can't
see that she will suffer by the loss of
I ,a wrence."
"Then I am not to graduate," sal*
Lawrence, sadly. "1 am not to have
my diploma."
"Have you won it?" asked his father.
" 1 d< .nt wish to be unnecessarily severe,
but I must ask what you have given to
the university in exchange for it."
Lawrence hung his head.
"It's true." he said. "1 begin to per
ceive that I am not fitted fora modern
collegiate life. Let Paddy have the
diploma. Palmam qui meruit ferat."
"And what do you intend to do?"
"I have an ambitious plan." returned
Lawrence, "and if you are generous to
me in the matter of money I believe
that I shall bring it to success. I have
dreamed of starting a purely educa
tional institution in Central America.
It is much 100 hot t here for either base
ball or football, and there is no water
for boat-racing. In that favored cli
mate I sh;:ll hope to concentrate th<
mind of youth upon purely intellectual
attainments, but I do not believe that
that can ever be done again in the tem
perate zone. Have I your e. nscnt?"
"You have," said John Hangs, "and
I think that's the best way out of it
< io. my son. and found your school, if
you run it on that principle it can
never be a rival of Vale. I'll back you
w tii all t he money you need."
And I say. Lawrence." said Harry,
"if you strike any fellow over there
who looks as if he could play football,
ship him across to me. They sav some
of those natives grow to be seven feet
high, and Yale will need two or three
men like that after Paddy leaves."

fection of the eyes which made it nec
essary for him to he accompanied
whenever he took an examination by

as ever.

Uanys, and after graduation he ac
cepted the post of athletic instructor

president.

love, and that she will be proud and
happy always.
