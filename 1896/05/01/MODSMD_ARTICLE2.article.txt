# New Football Rules.

### 
The Intercollegiate Football
Rules Committee, appointed i>y the
I'Diversity Athletic Club of New
York for the purpose of revising]
and adjusting the differences in
the various codes in force last year,
has completed its work and will
soon j>nl>lish the new rules, which
have been unanimously agreed
upon.
A complete revision and codifi
cation were make with an idea of
avoiding the tautology and am
biguity of the old codes, but in the
main the changes were minor alter
ations in the phraseology. The
three important questions which
were considered and which will af
fect the game as played next year
were those of mass momentum
plavs, fair catches, and officials.
The question of fair catch, which
was discussed and decided at the
previous meeting, was reconsidered
and the rule which was adopted is
practically the reinstatement of tin
old rule relative to fair catch in
force in 1898. At the previous
meeting of the committee it had
been decided to adopt the Harvard-
Princeton rule.
The argument was advanced at
Saturday's meeting, however, that
the football player of today had
been educated to avoid the unneces
sary tackling of the catcher, and
that any rule further than the old
penalty was unnecessary and sim
ply served to hamper the develop
ment of the game. The time lost
by the catching full-back in stoop
ing to touch down the ball was too
valuable to be lost needlessly, and
it was, therefore, decided to revert
to the old rule.
As to officials, it was decided
that there should be three, as in
185)8 —a referee, an umpire, and a
linesman. The referee and lines
man were required to give evidence
relative to fouls only upon request
of the umpire, except that it was
their duty to give such evidence
unasked in the event of the indulg
ence of any of the players in un
necessary roughness, foul tackling,
or similar tactics.
As to momentum plays, after
much debate, in which Harvard
and Pennsylvania opposed any
rule which required men to occupy

fixed positions, Yale and Princeton j
taking the opposite view, a com
promise rule was finally adopted
and the question was finally settled
in thiswise: It was decided t<> al
low no momentum plays.
They should he eradicated hy the
adoption of a rule providing that j
no man should start before the
hall was in play, with the excep
tion that a player might leave his
position and run toward his own
goal, and that the rule should not
he so const rued as to prevent any
player from taking one step for
ward through over anxiety to effect
the play. The reason for this tre
mendous power placed in the hands j
of an umpire, who, through ignor-!
a nee or a disposition to treat one
team unfairly, may, hy strictly en-j
forcing to the letter the rule pro-j
viding that no man shall start,]
seriously handicap and interfere
with the work of one team and
completely ruin the game.
As to mass plays, Harvard and |
Pennsylvania, opposed any rule
which should require the occupa
tion of fixed positions hy any par
ticular men. Yale and Princeton
urged the adoption of the Yale-
Princeton rule of last year for its
alleged effect in preventing mass
plays upon the center. A com
promise was agreed upon, which
provided that live men should he
on the line of scrimmage when the
hall was put in play; and that five
men in addition to the quarter
back should be permitted to oc
cupv positions behind the line,
provided that hut three men came
within the position occupied by the
virtual tackle, the additional two
being at least five yards behind the
ball.
As will be readily seen, these
changes do not materially affect
the game. Thev might be termed
precautionary regulations against
I evils. —PrincetmiKtu.
