# Notes From Cornell.
## 
### 
Crew matters at Cornell are much
retarded 1»v the cold spring. The
crews have, however, been out on
the water for some days, once actu
ally in a snowstorm. Progress is
inevitably slow. Much curiosity
has been expressed over the new
shell, which has just come from
England. English shells are heav
ier than American boats, and have
their seats on the sides instead of
in the center of the shell. As are-
I suit the boat is not as steady in the
water as one of American make,
but a more powerful leverage is
given for the stroke. Mr. Courtney
was last year much impressed by
the English racing shells, and it
j has been decided t<> give them a
J fair test during the practice of the
! Cornell crews this spring. It may
be, therefore, that Cornell will row
the quadrangular race in an Eng
lish boat next summer.
The school of law at Cornell
University is again strengthened
by the appointment of a brilliant
young professor. This time it is
Professor Edwin H. Woodruff of Ice
land Stanford Jr. University. He
is an authority on both library and
legal matter. Although a very
young man he has been assistant
in the Astor Library and Cornell
University library, librarian of
Professor Willard Fiske's library
at Florence, Italy, and of the Stan
ford University library. Besides
this he has been instructor in Eng
lish at Cornell, and for two years
professor of law at Iceland Stanford
University. Professor Woodruff
was a member of the first class that
ever graduated from the Cornell
Law School, and his graduation
thesis, entitled a "History of
Equity Jurisprudence in Massachu
setts" was published in the London
Law Quarterly Review, the great
est legal periodical in the English
language. Jointly with Professor
Huffcut of Cornell he is author of
"American Cases on Contract," now
used in the law schools of Cornell,
Stanford, the University of Penn
sylvania, University of the City of
New York, Michigan University,
and other schools. Professor Wood
i ruff is at present engaged in pre
paring an elementary treatise on
1 law. —Cornell.
