The Stanford People
Who formed our parties last year had a good time. More than liftv
Stanfordites and their friends selected this popular tourist route at the
close of last year and President mid Mrn. Jordan headed the Yellow xtom
Party.
The Northern Pacific is truly the best route for summer travel, and
of course the wonderful Yellowstone Park, which forms a delightful
half-way rest on an overland trip, can he seen only in summer. As to
service and equipment the Northern Pacific is surpassed by no othei
transcontinental road.
This year's Stanford party is now forming to go at the close of the
present semester, and all those who think of joining the paity
are requested to see Mr. W. 0. Price, 32 Alvarado Row,
or Mr. J. M, Ross, Library, who will have im
mediate charge of the excursion.
All persons expecting to go East or to Europe during the coming
summer vacation will find it to their advantage to call on or address
the above persons or the undersigned.
