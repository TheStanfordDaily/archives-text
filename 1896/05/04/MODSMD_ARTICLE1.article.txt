# STANFORD GETS $9,500,000.
## The 						Legacy Left by Senator Stanford Turned Over to the Trustees. 
### 
Since the favorable decision in
the Stanford suit reached by the
Supreme Court of the United States
on March 2, it has been the ear
nest wish of Mrs. Stanford to pay
the bequest of $2,500,000 to the
Trustees of the University. It was
believed by good authorities that
it would require two years in which
to settle the estate and make the
payment of this legacy pcssible.
By extraordinary diligence it might
be paid in one year. Mrs. Stan
ford, however, determined to pay it
in sixty days. And through her
earnest efforts, aided by her coun
sel Russel Wilson, this great sum
was paid to the Trustees of the
Universiey last Wednesday, tifty
seven days after the decision of the
Supreme Court.
•'On last Wednesday," says the!
San Francisco Kxaviiii.c-r, "theTrus
tees of the Lelaiul Stanford Jr. j
University met in San Francisco.
Of the twenty-four Trustees twenty
were present. These were Ex-Judge
F. E. Spencer, Irving M. Scott, llev.
Horatio Stebbins, Dr. 11. H. Dark
ness, Horace Davis, N. W. Spald
ing, Charles (joodall, Judge 1. S.
Belcher, John Boggs, E. R. Taylor,
Henry L. Dodge, Alfred L. Tubbs,
Josiah Stanford Jr., Charles (i. La
tlirop, Charles F. Crocker, Timothy
Hopkins, FraiiK Miller of Sacra
mento, S. F. Lieh of San Jose, Leon
Sloss, and George E. Cray. The
four absentees were Senator Wil
liam M. Stewart, who is in Wash
ington; Joseph D. (irant, who is not
in this city; Thomas Wei ton Stan
ford, a brother of the late Mr. Stan
ford, who is in Australia; and Judge
T. B. McFarland, who was in Los
Angeles with the Supreme Court.
'To this board M rs# Stanford gave
interest-bearing securities to the
full value of $2,500,000. When the
formal transfer had been made she
invited the twenty Trustees and
Mr. Wilson to luncheon with her.
"The securities in which the be
quest was paid were 2000 bonds of
the par value of $1,000 each of the
Galveston, Harrisburg & San
Antonio Railroad, bearing five per
cent interest, and 500 bonds of the
par value of $1,000 each of the
Mexican International Railway,
bearing four per cent interest. The
value of the 2,000 bonds of the Gal
veston, Harrisburg tV: San Anto
nio Railroad is $2,000,000, and the
yearly interest is $1(30,000. The
value of the 500 bonds of the Mexi
can International Railway is $500,-
000, and the yearly interest is $20,-
000.
"The University will receive,!here
fore, an income of $120,000 a year
$10,000 a month from this be
quest of $2,500,000. An incident
of the transfer is noteworthy. The
Trustees received the bonds on April
29. Two days later, May 1, the
half-yearly payment of interest on
the bonds of the Galveston, Harris
burg & San Antonio Railroad
was due. This interest, $50,000,
was received by the University.
Mrs. Stanford was particular that
the transfer should be made in time
for this money to pass into the
hands of the Trustees. And Mrs.

Stanford said that she would pay
the State tax on the bequest if the
tax is decided to he legally imposed.
She would have no conditions. The J
money was for the University, and j
the University should have it all." j
The payment of this legacy is of
great importance to the University, j
The three great farms transferred]
to the University during the life of I
Senator Stanford —the Vina, the |
Gridley, and the Palo Alto ranches
—are not. profitable and the pro
ceeds barely pay the taxes. Now
the University will have regularly
its income of $10,000 a month,
which will be sufficient to keep it
open. The expenses are $ 15,000 a
month, and Mrs. Stanford will fur
nish the necessary $5,000 a month
to keep the University in its pres
ent state of efficiency. In the past
Mrs. Stanford has supported the
University on the $10,000 a month
granted by the courts as a family
allowance. The period of prosperity j
and expansion may now be truly i
said to have begun.
The story of the handicaps under-1
gone by Mrs. Stanford and the
faculty are familiar to all. Many
untrue and stinging reports were
spread throughout the country
which had to be lived down. Mrs.
Stanford did not sell her jewels,
but just as great sacrifices were
made by all.
Other bequests in Senator Stan
ford's will are soon to be paid.
The Senator had seventeen nieces
and nephews, and each one of these
will receive at least $100,000.
Brothers receive $>>00,000 each.
When these legacies are paid the
remainder may be distributed to
Mrs. Stanford and the estate
c 1 osed.
The great properties at (* rid ley.
Nina, and Palo Alto will soon be
profitable or not, according to "the
times." Mrs. Stanford has man
aged to make them self-supporting
and is working to make them yield
profits.
The cherished aim of Mrs. Stan
ford is now fultilled and she left
Sunday evening for the East and
will take a short trip to England
fora much needed rest. She will
return in about two months.
Dr. Jordan said that the pay
ment of this legacy was the great
est thing which has happened to the
University since the winning of the
suit. "Two millions and a half
is in itself a large endowment, al
though it is not all we hope to get;
and this payment means that the
University can be open forever."
