The result of the second inter
collegiate baseball game may lea
blessing in disguise. We may be
excused for trusting that it is so.
Berkeley proved that her team was
the better in the game Saturday
and Stanford will be forced to ac
knowledge herself ex-champion of
the diamond unless our players get
out and practice hard for the de
ciding game next Friday. The
Varsity men have done their best,
but the second team has not been
out to give the lirst nine sufficient
practice, with the inevitable result.
We must have all our players out
every evening now and all must
work hard. The ball player who
does not appear when he knows the
need is greatest must be esteemed
very weak indeed in his loyalty.
