However much we may regret
our defeat in Saturday's baseball
game, we have greater cause for
distress in the conduct of several
thoughtless, over-zealous Stanford
enthusiasts. Good-natured " josh
ing "may be pardonable, and en
couraging college yells are to be ex
pected in any college contest, but
when these degenerate into a dis
graceful jeering and hooting of
members of a visiting team little
can be said in way of extenuation.
These offenders should be made to
feel how much they have done to
degrade Stanford's name for fair
ness and frank sportsmanlike de
portment.
Here at Stanford such treatment
of a visiting college team has never

l>een approached before and is con
trary to all our relics and tradi
tions. We can assure Berkeley
that the general sentiment here is
entirely opposed to such a de
meanor and that no one regrets the
incident more than the great mass
of loyal Stanford students.
College contests, at the best, in
stead of bringing the students of
respective institutions into closer
bonds of friendship, are apt to
tend towards an unhealthy rivalry,
which should not be intensified by
behavior for which we are after
wards ashamed and for which we
are compelled as gentlemen to
apologize for and excuse.
Unless we can win a contest by
honest hard playing, better accept
defeat than win l>v jeers. Never
let a minority make it possible for
critics to say that a Stanford crowd
so far forgot its dignity as to treat
visitors with the discourtesy shown
towards Berkeley during a portion
of that last unfortunate game.
