It was in the days when the German
armies had broken their way across
I 'ranee, and when the shattered forces
of the young republic had been swept
aside to the north of the Rhone and to
tiie south of the Loire Three broad
streams of armed men had rolled slow
ly but irresistibly from the Rhine, now
meandering'to the north, now to the
south, dividing, coalescing, but all
uniting to form one great lake round
I'aris And from this lake were welled
out smaller streams, one to the north,
one southward to Orleans, and a third
westward into Normandy Many a
derma u trooper saw the sea for the
first time when he rode his horse girth
det'p into the waves at Dieppe.
I Hack and bitter were the thoughts
of Frenchmen when they saw this weal
of dishonor slashed across the fair face
of their country They had fought and
they had been overborne. That swarm
ing cavalry, those countless footmen,
the masterful guns—they had tried and
tried to make head against them. In
battalions their invaders were not to
be beaten. Hut man to man, or ten to
ten they were their equals. A brave
Frenchman might still make a single
(rerman rue the day that he had left
his own bank of the Rhine. Thus, 1111-
ehronicled amid the battles and the
sieges, there broke out another war, a
war of individuals, with foul murder
upon the one side and brutal reprisal
upon the other.
Col. von Gramm, of the Twenty
fourth I'osen infantry, had suffered se
verely during this new development. lie
t.'ixntnanded in the I it t le Norman town ol
Les Andelys, and his outposts stretched
amid the hamlets and farmhouses of
the district round. No French force
was within fifty miles of him. and yet
morning after morning he had to listen
to a black report of sentries found dead
at their posts, or of foraging parties
which had never returned. Then the
colonel would go forth in his wrath,
and farm steading would blaze and vil
lages tremble, but next morning there
was still that same dismal tale to be
told. Do what he might he could not
shake off his invisible enemy. And yet
it should not have been so hard, for
from certain signs in common, in the
plan and in the deed, it was certain
that all these outrages came from a
single source.
Col. von Uramm had tried violence
and it had failed. (Sold might be more
successful. Me published it abroad over
t lie countryside that live hundred
francs would be paid for information.
There were no responses. Then eight
hundred. The peasants were incor
ruptible. Then, goaded on by a mur
dered corporal, he rose to a thousand,
and so brought the soul of Francois
Rejane. farm laborer, whose Norman
avarice was a stronger passion than
his French hatred.
"You say that you know who did
these crimes?" asked the Prussian
colonel, eyeing with loathing the blue

bloused. rat-faced creature before him.
"Yes, colonel." ,
"And it was—?"
"Those thousand francs, colonel—"
"Not a sou until your story has
been tested. Come! who is it who has
murdered my men?"
"It is Count Eustace, of Chateau
Noir."
"You lie!" cried the colonel, angrily.
"A gentleman and a nobleman could
not have done such crimes."
The peasant shrugged his shoulders.
"It is evident to tne that you do not
know the count It is this way, col
onel What 1 tell you is the truth, and
I am not afraid that you should test it.
The Count of Chateau Noir ij a hard
man—even at the best time he was a
hard man. l»ut of late he has been
terrible. It was his son's death, you
know. His son was under Donay. and
he was taken, and then in escaping l
from Germany, he met his death. It
was the count's only child, and indeed
we all think that it has driven him
mad. With his peasants he follows the
(rerman armies. I do not know how
many he has killed, but it is he who
cuts the cross upon the foreheads, for
it is the bad,ire of his house."
