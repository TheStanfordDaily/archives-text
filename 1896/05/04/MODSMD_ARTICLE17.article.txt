in the 100-yard straightaway, and
the records will not hold. Charles

10 feet 10-jV inches; Lloyd of Berk

I'. C. Harry Reynolds, '9(>, easily
won the 220-yard hurdle in 28 2-")
seconds. Torrey, I". C., did not
enter Ihe finals.
The l .C. entered twenty-eight
men and won forty-eight points.
The Amateur Academic League en
tered fourteen men and won twenty
four points. Stanford entered
three men and won seventeen
points. About $1000 will be added
to Berkeley's Eastern trip fund.
The field-day was not as great
a financial success as was expected,
and as a consequence it is extremely
doubtful whether more than six
men can be sent Last, and these
may only compete in the Western
Intercollegiate and the Mott Haven
games. The team will probably be
Mervvin, lulgren, Koch, Torrey,
Llovd. and Crafts.
