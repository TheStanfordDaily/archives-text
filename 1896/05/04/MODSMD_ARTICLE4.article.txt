# U.C. WINS.
## Berkeley Takes the Second Game of the Series. 
### 
To say that California surprised
us Friday is to put it mildly. One
week before, with both Taylor and
McLaine half sick, we bad taken
our opponents into camp on their
own grounds; Saturday they anni
hilated us on our campus to the
time of 13 to 3. It was simply a
case of being outplayed at every
point; they fielded better, batted
better, ran bases better. Morden
in the box was especially effective;
he has a puzzling drop which got
away with most of our batters.
Their infield played like clockwork,
and Wheeler threw to bases like a
shot. They played an errorless
game throughout, and deserve great
credit for the way they have pulled
together since the first game.
As for our own team, they
showed the results of extreme over
confidence. The men supposed,
after the first game, that they had
a sure thing in the second, conse
quently they were lifeless Friday.
Their team work was inexcusably
bad; twice an easy fly was con
verted into a hit by confusion as to
whom should take it.
McLaine was in poor form; he
has never pitched so badly since he
has been in the University, and
the team back of him was slow and
listless. There must be a big im
provement before Friday, or U. C.
will surely win the series.
For California, Elston probably
did the best work outside the bat
tery, while Sharp and Freeman
fielded best for Stanford. Free
man's throw-in of a dillicult catch
was one of the features of the
game. In the sixth inning, when
California had an insurmountable
lead, certain persons in the grand
stand attempted to "rattle'' Mor
den by "hooting" and "joshing."
The majority of the crowd dis
countenanced this unsportsman
like act, and the noise lasted
throughout that inning only. This
was all probably the result of
thoughtlessness, but it was enough
to give Berkeley visitors a poor
idea of our hospitality.
The score tells the tale:
UNIVKKSITY OF CALIFORNIA.
