# "Led Out into the Desert to be Tempted."

### 
Hev. J. K. McLean of Oakland
delivered the Sunday sermon. The
speaker said in part:
I have been able to think of no
subject more worthy of attention
than that of temptation, its place
in life, its significance, and its
mastery. It has a place in every
life. Not only is temptation un
avoidable, but 1 make leave to say
it would be a great misfortune if it
were avoidable. We can spare
anything better than temptation.;
Even the immaculate Jesus bad to
submit to it. It conies with great
tussling, yet it does not come to
destroy.
There are three things to be con
sidered in this story of our Master's
temptation. First, the wonder of
the temptation; second, the imple
ment with which Jesus met the
temptation; and third, his varied
handling of that implement.
Wonderful as is the temptation
of Jesus, it is yet more wonderful
that lie should have been tempted
at all; that with a character like
bis there should be any nook or
crevice wherein temptation could
lodge. But leaving this, we have
to note that Jesus was in the very
zenith of his power when the temp
tation came. We are accustomed
to think that temptation conies
only when we are weak, but here
we have it coming when the person
to be tempted was at his strongest.
We are accustomed, too, to think
of temptation as wholly evil; but
without temptation all the good in
the soul of man would lie latent.
Temptation is the crucible in which
man's nature is refined. If you
and I would have purity or strength
that is kingly it must come to us
through temptation.
The temptation of Jesus brings
up the whole subject of temptation.
1 le embodied all that man can have
of good. Starting unknown, he
bad labored for thirty years, and
now stands forth led away by the
spirit to be tempted. It was not
his first temptation. He had
passed through every temptation
that a man of thirty can know;
and now he was to submit to the
linal and supreme test. Like a ship
whose every oaken rib and plank
has been tested singly, and which
stands ready now as a whole for the
final test of the trial trip, Jesus now
stood forth tested in every part but
having to stand the test as a whole.
This is paralleled in every life.
You, young men and women, have
been subjected to the temptations;
tirst, of the kindergarten, then of
the grammar school and the high
school and the college, and you will
soon be brought to the supreme test.
You will soon turn your face to the
world, and will meet the question,
What are you going to do in life?
What is your supreme choice? and
this will be your test as a whole.
In the implement with which Je
sus met the tempter we have some
thing of perhaps more importance
than the temptations themselves.
That implement is embodied in the
words, "It is written." Jesus throws
himself back upon this great Hook
of Cod, knowing that not only is
the answer written there, but that
it is written also in the greater book
of universal human experience.

This lust, in of importance, for what
a man finds in his consciousness is
strengthened if he recognizes it also
in the whole history of his race.
Jesus relied upon this, and with
this weapon conquered.
As regards the manner with
which Jesus handled his weapon,
let us observe each temptation sep
arately. When Satan said, "Com
mand that these stones he made
bread," Jesus answered, "It is writ
ten, That man shall not live by
bread alone." He thus, while rec
ognizing bodily wants as just
claims, subordinates them to spirit
ual requirements, and points a
moral to those who would excuse
evil on the ground that "One must
live." It points a moral also to
those who have some single aim or
ambition, and whose eyes are
Winded to everything else but that
one tiling. They forget that man
can not live "by bread alone."
We are not to be delivered from
temptation. If we would grow into
manhood and into womanhood, if
we would win character, we must
be conquerors like our Lord .Jesus.
Do not seek to avoid temptation,
but conquer it, and get that strength
and beauty of character which
conies only through temptations
met and overcome.
