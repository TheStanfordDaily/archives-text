It has often been said that there
i-< no class spirit at Stanford. One
reason for this is probably plain to
all. The classes here are so inter
mingled in the recitation rooms
that it is hard for students to re
cognize their fellow-classmen. This
is no excuse, however, for allowing
all class enthusiasm to lay dor
mant. The fact that all the mem
bers of the Senior (!iass graduate
in.)(> should be sufficient to bind
those persons together to a certain
extent. The meeting of a common
enemy in rushes should awaken a
fraternal feelinir among the mem
bers of the lower classes. The
class affairs of various kinds should
have a 1 ii<e effect upon the upper
class-men. It is a mistake to sup
pose that class spirit can only show
itself in rushes and petty strifes.
There are many student activities
in which a healthy rivalry would
be beneficial. Let us have more
class spirit.
