It was true. The murdered sentries
had each had a saltire cross slashed
across their brows, as by a hunting
knife. The colonel bent his stiff back
ami ran his forefinger over the map
which lay upon the table.
"The Chateau Noir is not more than
four leagues," he said.
"Three and a kilometer, colonel."
"You know the place?"
"1 used to work there."
Col. von (xrainm rang the bell.
"(iive this man food and detain him,"
said he to the sergeant.
"Why detain me, colonel? I can tell
you no more."
"We shall need you as guide."
"As guide! Hut the count! If I were
to fall into his hands! Ah, colonel—"
The Prussian commander waved him
away. "Send ( apt. Haumgarten to me
at once," said lie.
The officer who answered the sum
mons was a man of middle age, heavy
jawed, blue eyed, with a curving yel
low mustache and a brick-red face
which turned to an ivory white where
his helmet had sheltered it. lie was
bald with a shining, tightly-stretched
scalp, at the back of which, as in a
mirror, it was a favorite mess joke for
the subalterns to trim their mustaches.
As a soldier he was slow, but reliable
and brave. The colonel could trust
him where a more dashing officer
might bu in danger.
"V»)u will proceed to Chateau Noir
to-night, captain." said he."A guide
has been provided. You will arrest
the count and bring him back. If there
is any attempt at rescue, shoot him at
once."
"How many men shall I take,
colonel?"
"Well, we are surrounded by spies,
and our only chance is to pouuee'upon
him before he knows that we are upon
i lie way. A large force will attract at
tention. On the other hand, you must
not risk being cut off."
"i might march north, colonel, as if
to join (Jen. Goeben. Then I could
tarn down tiiis road which I see upon
y mr map. and get to Chateau Noir be
f re they could hear of us. In that
« ast' with twenty men —"
"Very good, captain. I hope to see
you with your prisoner to-morrow
morning.'*
It was a cold December night when
('apt. Haumgarten marched out of Les
Andelys with his twenty Poseners and
l >k the main road to the northwest.
Two miles out he turned suddenly
down a narrow, deeply-rutted track
and made swiftly for his man. A thin,
cold rain was falling, swishing among
the tall poplar treesand rustling in the
fields on either side. The captain
walked lirsl with Moser. a veteran ser
geant. beside him. The sergeant's
wrist was fastend to that of the French
peasant, and it had been whispered in
his ear that in ease of the ambush the
first bullet fired would be through his
head Hehind them the twenty infan-

trymen plodded along through the
darkness with their faces sunk to the
rain and their boots squeaking in the
soft, wet clay. They knew where they
were*going, and why, and the thought
upheld them, for they were bitter at
the loss of their comrades. It was a
cavalry job, they knew, but the cavalry
were all on with the advance, and be
sides, it was more fitting that the regi
ment should avenge its own dead men.
It was nearly eight when they left
Les Audelys. At half-past eleven their
guule stopped at a place wnere two
high pillars crowned with some her
aldic stone work, flanked a huge iron
gate. The walls in which it had been
the opening had crumbled away, but
the great gate still towered above the
brambles and weeds which had over
grown its base. The Prussians made
their way round it, aim advanced
stealthily under the shadow of a black
tunnel of oak branches up the long
avenue which was still cumbered by
the leaves of last autumn. At the top
they halted and reconnoitred.
