Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The developments amongsome of
»lit* spectators during the sixth and
seventh innings of hist Saturday's
basehall game was to many of us a
very disagreeable surprise.
To those who are acquainted
with the uniformly quiet and
gentlemanly demeanor of the Stan
font students on the campus and in
the class room, it seemed incredible
that for the space of two innings
the ungentlemanly and unsports
manlike element among us should
have been able to assert itself. It
wants to lie clearly understood that
the men who were using unsports
manlike tactics to win a game in
• which we were fairly and squarely
beaten were not the mucker ele
ment from the surrounding towns;
thev were Stanford University stu
dents. And it wants further to
be understood that during the two
innings referred, to this element
was not cheering our nine— a per
fectly legitimate proceeding- they
were jeering at and ''joshing" in
dividual members of the Berkeley
team with a view to breaking down
their play. The Berkeley nine
were our guests and playing on our
home grounds; they should have
been treated with all the respect
and consideration which a gentle
man is accustomed t«» pay to an in
vited guest. The I'. C. cheer given
at the beginning and end of the
game should have been an index
of the treatment accorded 10 the
Berkeley men during the entire
game, as it actually was an index
oj the sentiment of most of our stu
dents toward a visiting team.
Judging from the feeling that
has manifested itself among the
faculty and students since Satur
days game, it is safe to predict that
the ungentlemanly element will
not again be suffered to misrepre
sent the general student spirit in
the g.iines on home grounds.
