Editor Daily Palo Alio:
For some time past tlie attention
of the community lias been more or
less drawn to the coming Co-op.
election which has heen called for
Thursday next at 2 o'clock. Be
lieving that the community has a
real interest in this election, I feel
justified in calling attention to
the following facts which have re
cently come to my attention.
On the 2- r )th day of April last
one hundred and twenty-five shares
of stock were issued to J. F. Har
nett, who is a candidate for the po
sition of business manager of the
Co-op. for the ensuing year. By
far the larger part of these shares
was entirely new stock. Since no
pecuniary advantage can come to
any one from holding more than
one share of stock, one share en
titling the holder to all the privi
leges of the Co-operative Associa
tion, these shares were bought for
the sole purpose of controlling the
coming election.
The only justification offered by
Mr. Burnett for this purchase is
that the other candidates secured a
lead on him in the canvass, which
has been fair and open, and this
was the only thing left for him to
do.
It may be said that I have had
recourse to similar methods. I
wish to deny this in advance. The
only share 1 have purchased be
sides my own was that of a fellow
townsman and old school-mate of
mineâ€”Harry Pincus. The pur
chase was not made to secure the
proxy, but to accommodate him, as
lie was leaving the University.
My methods have been fair and
open throughout.
Jay E. Lawshe.
