general holiday has been decreed
by !)r. Jordan; special trains for

Stanford and U. C., a field-day

and basket-ball game in the
! afternoon, and a vaudeville en
tertainment in the evening by the

] will undoubtedly be a large at
| tendance of Stanford students in
| San Jose on that day, and it will
! be then that the large number of
' .
| visitors who are stopping in the
i town and who have never brushed
!up against Stanford enthusiasm,
I will form their opinions of the re
j spective merits and demerits of our
i ('Diversity. "By a man's acts so
shall he be judged"'; and if the
conduct of :ill be within the con
lines of strict propriety and gentle
manly behavior by so much will
the name of our University rise in
the estimation of the people. We
have a most favorable opportunity
to show to the people of the state
that we are worthy of the high rep
utation which the standing of our
college has bestowed upon us.
