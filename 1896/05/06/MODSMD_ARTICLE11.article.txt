The black chateau lay in front of
them. The moon had shone out be
tween two r-iin clouds, and threw the
old house into silver and shadow. It
was shaped like an L, with a low
arched door in front, and lines of small
windows like the open ports of a man
of-war. Above was a dark roof break
ing - at the corners into little round
overhanging turrets, the whole lying
silent in the moonshine with adrift of
ragged clouds blackening the heavens
behind it. A single light gleamed in
one of the lower windows.
The captain whispered his orders to
his men. Some were to creep to the
front door, some to the back. Some
were to watch the east and some the
west, lie and the sergeant stole on
tiptoe to the lighted window.
It was a small room into which they
looked, very meanly furnished. An
eldetly man in the dress of a menial
was reading 1 a tattered paper by the
Ii Â«r 111 of a sputtering candle, lie leaned
back in his wooden chair, with his feet
upon a box, while a bottle of white
wine stood with a half-filled tumbler
upon a stool beside him. The sergeant
tin list his needle gxin through the
glass and the man sprang to his feet
with a shriek.
"Silence for your life! The house is
surrounded, and you cannot escape.
Come round and open the door or we
will show you no mercy when we come
in."
"For God's sake, don't shoot! I will
open it! I will open it!" He rushed
from the room with his paper still
crumpled up in his hand. An instant
later, with a groaning of old locks and
a rasping of bars, the low door swung
open and the Prussians poured into the
stonc-llagged passage.
"Where is Count Eustace de Chateau
Noir?"
"My master! lie is out, sir."
"Out at this time of night? Your
life fora lie!"
"It is true, sir."
"Where?"
"I do not know."
"Doing what?"
"I cannot tell. No, it is no use
cocking your pistol, sir. You may kill
me, but you cannot make me tell you
that which I do not know."
"Is he often out at this hour?"
"Frequently."
"And when does he come home?"
"Hefore daybreak."
Capt. Haumgarten rasped out a Ger
nn:ni oath, lie had had his journey for
nothing, then. The man's answers
were only too likely to be true. It, was
what he might have expected. Hut at
least he would search the house and
make sure. Leaving a picket at the
front door and another at the back, the
sergeant and he drove the trembling
butler in front of them, his shaking
candle sending strange flickering shad
ows over the old tapestries and the low
oak-rafted ceilings. They searched

the whole house from the luiffe stone
flagged kitchen below to the (lining
hall on the second floor with its jailers
for musicians and its panelling black
with age. hut nowhere was there a liv
ing' creature. L'p in an attic they
found Marie, the elderly wife of the
butler, but the owner kept no other
servants, and of his own presence there
was no trace.
It was long, however, before Capt.
Haumgarten had satisfied himself upon
the point. It was a difficult house to
search. Thin stairs, which only one
man could ascend at a time, connected
lines of tortuous corridors. The walls
were so t hick that each room was cut
off from its neighbor. Huge tire-places
yawned in each, while the windows
were six feet deep in the wall. Capt.
Haumgarten stamped with his feet, and
tore down curtains, and struck with
the pummel of his sword. If there
were secret hiding-places he was not
fortunate enough to find them.
"I have an idea," said he at last,
speaking in Herman to the sergeant.
"You will place a guard over this fel
low and make sure that he communi
cates with no one."
