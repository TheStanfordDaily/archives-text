A zoological expedition to Lower
California, sent out by \V. W'â€¢
Price, '97, left yesterday on the
steamer Orizaba. The objective
point is San Jose del Cabo in
the cape region at the extremity of
the peninsula. Three months will
be spent in collecting birds and
mammals, and a small collection of
crustacea and bird-lice will be made
tor Professor Kellogg.
The country has been little ex
ploited, one or two attempts having
been made by the Academy of Sci
ences within recent years. It is
said to lie rich in rare species. Al
though under private direction,
t lie expedition is nominally a St;i n
ford enterprise. Dane Coolidge,
is in charge and will be accom
panied by .J. F. Abbott, '99, and
Love Miller, U. C. '9S.
