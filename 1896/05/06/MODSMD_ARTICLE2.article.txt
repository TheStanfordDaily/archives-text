# Crater Lake and the Mazamas.
## 
### 
Mazama is the name of the
mountain goat, and a club of
mountain-climbers in Oregon have
adopted the word as the title of
their organization. Mr. C. B.
Watson, who spoke in the chapPl
last evening, is the president of the
club.
About two years ago there was a
party of four hundred people en
camped at Mount Hood, and there j
the club was organized, the quali- j
Hcation for membership being that i
one should have climbed the snow-1
capped mountains of the range.!
Last year the club divided, a part!
going to Ranier, part to Mount Ad- \
atns, and a third part to Mount 1
Helena. This year they are going
to Crater Lake.
The object of the club is not to
make money. Part of the purpose
of the organization is to take a very
active part in formulating plans by
which the forests may be preserved.
Crater Lake is one of the most |
wonderful places in the world. It
is situated in the Cascade Range,
eighty-five miles from Ashland,
Oregon. It is of volcanic forma
tion, and at its greatest deptli the
water measures two thousand feet. I
Mountains in the center rise in!
some places two thousand feet'
above the surface, so that the en-1
tire depth of the lake must be over
four thousand feet. Forests of pine, j
fir, and sugar maple surround the |
lake and make the scenery most at
tractive.
The slides shown during the lec
ture were excellent ones, and the
talk was followed with considerable I
interest by those who attended.
