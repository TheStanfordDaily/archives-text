Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Pear Sir —The enclosed commu
nication appears to me to he of
general interest to members of the
Co-operative Association. I there
fore submit it to you with the re
quest that it he published in this
evening's issue of the Palo Alto.
I do this in view of statements
made in Mr. Lawshe's letter pub
lished yesterday.
Geokge E. Howard.
Stanford University, April, 1890.
M} 7 dear Miss : A large
number of shareholders in our
Co-operative Association are non
resident, and the task of calling in
enough proxies for a legal election
is becoming most burdensome.
This malady will have to be reme
died sometime, and 1 propose to
bring matters to a climax by pledg
ing Mr. Harnett, one of the candi
dates for manager, to transfer all
shares held by non-residents to new
students before issuing any new
si i a res. The charge for transference is
set bv the board of directors; in the
past it has been fifty cents.
Mr. Harnett's other qualifications
for the managership are in keeping
with his reform ideas regarding
proxies, ile had four years' busi
ness experience before entering
Stanford, and for the past year has
been assistant manager of t lie Co-op.
His intimate knowledge of the busi
ness makes him feel confident that
he can economize in many direc
tions and thus dispense with the
capital usually derived from the
sale of new shares, lie will gradu
ate next year, 'U7. The other can
didates, Messrs. Hunker and
Lawshe, graduate this year, I be
lieve.
If Mr. Harnett is elected, he will
send you a postal, asking for the
return of your share, lie will then
transfer it to some new student and
refund you $2.00 and you will be
relieved from all further supplica
tions for proxies. His election de
pends somewhat on your proxy and
I therefore beseech you to for
ward it to me without delay. The
election will be held on May 7.
You may have already sent your
proxy to one of the other candi
dates. People sometimes change
their minds, and they not infre
quently do so in the case of elec
tions. If you wish to cancel a pre
vious proxy, you can do so by
signing the inclosed blank and
writing, in the line above your
name, the name your previous
proxy bore. We never know who
is the best candidate until just
before election time. This two dol
lar refunding proposition may be
an inducement to you to make a
change and, furthermore, Mr. Har
nett shows a full appreciation of the
situation, understands all the
workings of the business, and
knows just what the shareholders
want.
Please lose no time in forward
ing your proxy.
Yours truly,
E. II. Zion.
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Recent developments 'in the
coming election for manager of
the Co-op. have brought out two
notable defects in the statute under

which our Co-operative Association
is incorporated. One is the proxy
system, and the other is the pro
vision which makes it possible to
obtain control by the purchase of
shares.
Neither of ihe candidates can be
censured for availing himself of
these provisions in the statute. In
a previous communication it has
been said that the will of the ma
jority of members of the Co-opera
tive Association will be defeated by
the purchase of shares for the pur
pose of voting. This is in one
sense true, but the result of elections
under the proxy system of voting
is controlled almost entirely I»v
the proxies of non-resident mem
bers who can have no knowledge of
the qualifications of the candidates,
and one who has availed himself
of the advantage of the proxy sys
tem can not consistently object to
the purchase of shares by a politi
cal opponent.
It is certainly evident that the
Co-operative Association should be
re-incorporated under the later
provisions of the Code, which are
intended t<> remedy these defects.
This may be done by a mere vote
of the directors and stockholders.
(Cal. Civil Code, Amendment of
1893 to § 362.)
An amendment in 1895 to § 288
of the California Civil Code places
the election entirely in the hands
of those who are able to attend the
election in person. Because of its
being a membership and not a
stock corporation, according to the
new provision, the evils of the
proxy system may be obviated bv
its prohibition in the by-laws.
In sub-section 2 of the same
amendment, the possibility of one
member acquiring greater interests
or rights in a corporation than
another member is prohibited.
It can be seen at a glance that
neither of the candidates lias done
more than to avail himself of the
rights given him by statute. The
fault, if any, lies in the statute, and
can lie remedied only by re-incor
poration under the amendment,
and not by personal invective.
