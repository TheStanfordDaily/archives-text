The sermon in the chapel next
Sunday morning will be delivered
by Rev. II. F. Briggs of Santa
Cruz on a subject yet to be an
nounced. Dr. Briggs is not a
stranger to the University, having
preached here last year, what
was considered one of the best ser
mons of the year, He is described
as a man of much ability and
power, and a speaker well cal
culated to interest a University
audience, being in close touch with
all forms of student life. None
should miss the opportunity of
hearing him.
