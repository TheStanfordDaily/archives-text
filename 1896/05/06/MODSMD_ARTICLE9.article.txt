The editorial which appeared
yesterday in regard to the coming
election for manager of the co-oper
ative book-store has aroused some
comment and may have been un
necessarily severe. It is not the
policy of this paper to take radical
sides with any party in any election
and if the circumstances brought
out by tomorrow's election show
that the paper has been unjust, we
are sorry for it, as we desire to be
fair to all parties concerned. In
pursuance of this policy we may
say that our columns are open to a
fair discussion by both sides for
whatever statements they may care
to make, and in another column
will be found a communication
from the other side in answer to
the communication published yes
terday.
