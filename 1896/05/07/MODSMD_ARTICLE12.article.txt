A recent number of Harper'is
Weekly contains the following arti
cle of interest on curve-pitching:
"The inventor of curve-pitching has
been quietly living in Athol, Mass.,
selling wall paper. Years ago,
while throwing clam shells from a
beach, he noticed their curves in
Might, and after a year of practice
in trying to get a similar curve for
a baseball he found himself enabled
one day, when pitching fora Brook
lyn baseball club, to send in two
out-curves in succession to Archie
Bush of (he llarvards, and ever
afterwards he controlled the ball in
the modern way. He gave lessons
to a Princeton pitcher and to Avery
of Yale. All old Harvard men re
member well that in 1874 Yale,
with Avery in the box, succeeded
for the first time in the history of
the two colleges in winning a game
of baseball for Yale against Harv
ard. The next year Ernst got the
trick, and Harvard regained her
laurels from Yale.
