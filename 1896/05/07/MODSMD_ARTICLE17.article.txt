Tomorrow we Khali have our
lust chance to bring the 1890 base
ball championship to Stanford.
The game is sure to lie an excit
ing one, as each college lias now a
victory to its credit. We trust
our nine will be able to put up a
better game than they did last
Saturday, and hope that victory
will perch on their banners. But
above all we trust that every Stan
ford student who attends the game
will do all in his power to preserve
the spirit of friendly rivalry hereto
fore existing between thist"Diversity
and Berkeley. No matter what oc
curs there should be no repetition of
the scenes enacted last Saturday.
The continuance of the various at h
letic contests between the two uni
versities imperatively demands that
a spirit of friendliness and mutual
good understanding should prevail.
Unpaid subscriptions must l>e settled at once.
