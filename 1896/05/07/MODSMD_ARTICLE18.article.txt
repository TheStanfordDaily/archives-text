# The 						Four Crews.
## 
### 
The course for the great quad
rangular boat race is still unde
cided, although I lie date for the
race is only about two months dis
tant. All of the four colleges have
the men, from whom will be chosen
their respective crews, in active
training, and although the final
make-up of any of them is as yet
uncertain, it is pretty well known
that each of them will be satisfactor
ily represented.
Pennsylvania's crew will be com
posed largely of new men, but all
who are trying for places in the
varsity boat show ainph ability,
and the crew as finally chosen will
probably be all that can be asked
for. There are also a number of
good men who are trying for the
freshman college crew, who are
eligible for the varsity, and some
who are doing excellent work in the
varsity freshman boat who will be
eligible when they have passed the
spring examinations.
Rowing matters at Harvard are
at present in a rather unsettled
condition. The number of candi
dates is very small. Mr. Watson
has not yet returned from his trip
abroad, and as a result of his ab
sence the stroke which the crew
will row this year has not been de
cided upon, even at this late date.
Captain Billiard is working hard,
however, and as soon as Coach
Watson returns, matters will prob
abl v be straightened out satisfactor
ily.*
Of the Columbia crew very lit
tle is known, excepting that all the
old men but two are in training,
and that these two vacant places
will probably be filled with entirely
new men. Most of the work so far
has consisted of rowing on the
machines.
The crew at Cornell is progress
ing very satisfaetorilv, and theout
look fora winning boat is favor
able. The list of candidates is very
large, live men of great experience
being in training for the position of
last year's oarsmen. I'enitxylvan
