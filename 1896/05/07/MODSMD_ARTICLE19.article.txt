"Yes. captain."
"And you will place four men in am
busli at ilie front, and at the back. It
is likely enough that about daybreak
our bird may come oack to the nest."
"And the othe»s. captain?'"
"Let I hem have their suppers in the
kitchen This fellow will serve you
with meat and wine. Itisa wild night,
and we shall be better here than on the
count iv road."
"And yourself, captain?"
"I will take my supper up here in
the dining-hall. The logs are laid,
and we can light the (ire. You will
e:il! me if there is any alarm. What
tan you give me for supper—you?"
"Alas, monsieur, there was a time
when I might have answered 'what
you wish.' Hut now it is all that we
can no i.i kind a bottle of uew claret ami
a cold pullet."
"That will do very well. Let a guard
go about with him. sergeant, and let.
him feel the end of a bayonet if he
plays us any tricks."
('apt. Uauingarten was an old cam
paigner. In the eastern provinces and
before that in Ilohemia he had learned
the art of quartering himself on the
enemy. While the butler brought his
supper in he occupied himself in mak
ing his preparations fora comfortable
night, lie lit the candelabrum of ten
candles upon the center table. The
tire was already burning up. crackling
merrily and sending spurts of blue
pungent smoke out into the room. The
captain walked to the window and
looked out. The moon had gone in
again, and it was raining heavily lie
could hear the deep s.mgli of the wind,
and see the dark gloom of the trees, all
swaying in one direction. It.was a
sight which gave a /.est tohise nnforta
ble quarters, and to the cold fowl and
the bottle of wine which the butler
had brought up for him. lie was tired
ami hungry after his long tramp as lie
threw his sword, his helmet and his re
volver belt down upon a chair, and fell
to eagerly upon his supper. Then,
with his glass of wine before him. and
a cigar between his lips, he tilted his
chair back and looked about liiin.
Hi' sat within a small circle of bril
liant light which gleamed upon his
silver shoulder straps and threw out
hi.*, terra c.olta face, his heavy eyebrows
and !n yt II >w mie tactic, lint outside
that circle things wire vague and shad
owy in the <>ld dining-hall. Two sides
were oak panelled and two were hung
with faded tape; .try, across which
hunt!-men arid dugs and stags were
still dimly streaming. Above the fire
place were rows of heraldic shields,
with t lie blazonings of the family and
its alliances, the fatal sal tire cross
breaking out on each of tlieui.
Four paintings of old Seigneurs of
Chateau Xoir faced the fireplace, all
men with hawk noses and bold high
features, so like each othci that only

the dress could distinguish the crusader
from the cavalier of the Fronde, ( apt.
Baumgarten, heavy with his repast,
lay back in his chair looking up at
them through the cloud of his tobacco
smoke, and pondering over the strange
chance which hail sent him. a man from
the lialtic coast, to cat his supper in
the ancestral hall of these proud Nor
man chieftains, lint the tire was hot
and the captain's eyes were heavy.
His chin sank slowly upon his chest,
and the ten candles gleamed upon the
broad, white scalp.
Suddenly a slight noise brought him
to his feet. For an instant it seemed
to his dazed senses that one of the pic
tures opposite had walked from its
frame There, beside the table, and
almost within arm's length of him.
was standing a huge man, silent, mo
tionless. with no sign of life, save his
fierce, glinting eyes. He was black
haired. olive-skinned, with a pointed
tuft of black beard and a great fierce
nose, toward which all his features
seemed to run. His cheeks were
wrinkled like a last year's apple, but
his sweep of shoulder, and bony, cord
ed hands told of a strength which was
unsapped by age. His arms were
folded across his arching chest, and his
mouth was set in a fixed smile.
