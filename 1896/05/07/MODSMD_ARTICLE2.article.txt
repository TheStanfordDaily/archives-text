The third and deciding intercol
legiate baseball game will be played
tomorrow morning in San Jose.
The Stanford men have been prac
tising hard and faithfully during
the week and will surely jjive a bet
ter exhibition than on last Satur
day.
The chief fault with the Stanford
team throughout the year has been
weak batting and the principal
blame for this rests on the out
fielders. The out-tield should con
tain the main batting strength of
the nine, since almost any average
player can catch a fly. But our
three out-fielders have not made a
base-hit in either intercollegiate
game.
In Varsity games the men have
the following remarkably low aver
ages in battery: Thompson .821,
Sharp .266, Taylor .200, Stansbery
.227, Harris .218, Young .208, Jeffs
.172, McLaine .16(5, Freeman .142.
Batting, cool-headed batting, is
what Stanford needs to win, and
without it she will lose the cham
pionship for the tirst time.
Following are the players and
their positions: McLaine and Jeffs,
battery; Young, Harris, Sharp, and
Taylor, in-fleld; Stansbery, Free
man, and Thompson, out-Held; and
Wight and Strohn, substitutes.
