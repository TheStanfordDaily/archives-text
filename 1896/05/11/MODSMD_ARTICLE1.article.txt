# HO, FOR THE EAST!
## Stanford Athletes to Enter the Western Intercollegiate Championship Events. 
### 
For sonic time I he Stanford truck
management has been quietly at
work endeavoring to effect some
scheme by which the track team
might go East, and plans have at
length heen arranged which prom
ise complete success; the scheme
seems feasible and so sure do the
manager and captain feel that suc
cess is at hand that they have at
length sprung their surprise.
After the last intercollegiate field
day it was generally recognized
that Stanford had an aggregation
of ten or a dozen athletes of the
first water, and many of the best
authorities on the Coast expressed
an opinion that they were second
to but few college teams in the East,
and a desire to see Stanford pitted
against some of the Eastern teams.
One of the drawbacKs to Eastern
trips generally is the number of
men that have to be taken, which
causes a great expense. Fortun
ately for Stanford, however, she
possesses two or three lirst-elassall
round athletes who are at the same
time champions in some one line,
so that she can send a team of eight
men East who should bt* able to
win a creditable number of points
and not unlikely the Western In
-1 ereol legiate championship. In
ease Stanford succeeded in doing
this, she would have the right to
name the next president of that or
ganization and would bring re
nown to our <ilnut muter.
An enthusiast-in San Francisco
declared that with eight men Stan
ford should win the championship
and certainly could enter with
favorable chances of success. Last
year thirty points would have won
the coveted lirst place.
The scheme is as follows: The
Senior Class is issuing a Class-Hook,
unique in its way and elaborate in
its make-up. The book will he of
large album size (11 by 14), bound
in neatly engraved cover with the
class colors, straw gold and car
dinal. it will contain individual
photographs of the Stanford family,
University faculty, and Senior
Class; large group pictures of the
Varsity and class football, base
ball, and track teams, and between
lifty and seventy-five of the best
obtainable views of the quadrangle,
Palo Alto, Mrs. Stanford's residence,
interior views of buildings, athletic
grounds, and snap-shots. Among
these will be reproductions of
photographs taken during the
celebration after the announcement
of victory in the Stanford suit.
The price of the book is $">.()()
and enough orders are now in to
for the vast enterprise which lias
been accomplished by the work of
Messrs. llanscomb and Col liver.
These gentlemen have generously
consented to divide all profits, half
and half, with the track team after
the first two hundred books have
been disposed of, the only condi
tion being that the track manage
ment combine with them as far as
possible in increasing the sales.
There is absolutely no responsibil
ity and no out lay incident on the
track men, and as the sale of the
book promises to he very great
there is no doubt that almost, if

not quite enough money can be
raised by the scheme to send the
men East. What deficit, there re
mains will be made up by the
members of the team themselves if
necessary. The only thing they
ask is that all who can subscribe
for this valuable souvenir volume
will do so. He thereby gets his
money's worth in a magnificent
work and aids the team in going
East. Such class-books are rarely
issued from the same university
oftener than once in six or eight
year.? and invariably sell for ten or
twelve dollars.
If the plan succeeds the team
will leave about June 1, and will
take part in the games on June (Â»
in Chicago. Entrance application
has already heen made and the
men have ample time in the next
three weeks to get into condition.
Several San Francisco enthusiasts
have offered their services gratui
tously to coach the men; rubbers
will be engaged at once and a
training table started.
Eight men only will leave,
among t liese the following are proba
bilities: Hrunton, Dole, Bernhard,
Toombs. Wilbur, Reynolds, Brown,
Jack, Flazier, Fiekert,and llazzard.
