The yo.nr just closing has been
a remarkable one for Stanford ath
letics. For the first time our track
men have shown themselves to be
or: a par with, if not superior to,
those of Berkeley. Our baseball
team has kept the championship
here, where it has always
been. In tennis we have been
equally fortunate, Berkeley
winning only one point out of six,
and the championship coming to
Stanford. In basket-ball, the first
intercollegiate contest between the
women of the universities, we were
victorious. Such a record ought to

incite our football men to their ut
most next full. It is certainly a
record that rarely conies to any
university.
