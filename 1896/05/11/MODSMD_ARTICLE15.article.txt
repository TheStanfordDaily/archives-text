"Pray do not trouble yourself to look
for your weapons." he said, as the
Prussian cast a swift glance at the
empty chair in which they hail
been laid. "You have been, if you
will allow me to say so, a little
indiscreet to make yourself so much
at home in a house every wall of
which is honeycombed with secret pas
sages. You will be amused to hear
that forty men were watching you at
your supper. Ah! What then!"
Capt. itaumgarten had taken a step
forward with clenched fists. The
Frenchman held up a revolver which
he grasped in his right hand, while
with his left he hurled the (Jerman
bach* into his chair.
"Pray keep your seat," said he. "You
have no cause to trouble about your
men. They have already been pro
vided for It is astonishing with these
stone Hours how little one can hear
what goes on beneath You have been
relieved of your command, and have
now only to think of yourself. May i
ask what your name is'.'"
"I am ('apt. Baumgarten, of the
Twenty-fourth Posen regiment."
"Your French is excellent, though
you incline, like most of your country
men. to turn the p into ab. I have
been amused to hear them cry: 'Ave/,
bitie sur moi!' You know, doubtless,
who it is who addresses you'.'"'
"The count of Chateau .Voir."
"Precisely. It would have been a
misfortune if you had v*ifitod my
chateau and 1 had been unable to have
a word with you. 1 have had to do
with many (Jernian soldiers, but never
with an of.leer before. 1 have much to
talk to you about."
Capt. liaumgarten sat still in his
chair. Mrave as he was there was
something in this man's manner which
i mde his skin creep with apprehension.
I lis eyes glanced to right a;. 1 to left,
but his weapons w re gone, an 1 in a
struggle he saw that he was but a
child with this gigantic adversary.
The count had picked up the claret
bottle and hel 1 it to the light.
"Tut! Tut!" said he."And was this
the best that Pierre could do for you?
I am ashamed to look you in the face.
Capt. Uaumgarten, we must improve
upon t his."
lie blew a call upon a whistle which
hung from uis shooting-jfuket. The

cri 1. and a minute later a grey
lo';tle. streaked with cobwebs, was
carried in as a nurse bears an infant.
The count filled two glasses to the
brim.
"Prink," said he."It is the very
belt in my cellars, and not to be
ia tche I between Home and Paris.
I'riv.k. sir, and be happy! There are
e !I j >inis below There are two lob
j.terrt fiv:.h from llonfieur. Will you

not venture upon a second and more
savory supper?"
The German officer shook his head.
He drained his glass, however, and his
host filled it once more, pressing him
to give an order for this or that dainty.
"There is nothing in my house which
is not at your disposal. You have but
to say the word. Well, then, you will
allow me to tell you a story while you
drink your wine. I have so longed to
tell it to some German officer. It is
about my son, my only child Eustace,
who was taken and died in escaping. It
is a curious little story, and I think I
can promise you that you never will
forget it.
"You must know then, that my boy
was in the artillery, a fine young fel
low, Capt. Baumgarten, and the pride
of his mother. She died within a week
of the news of his death reaching us.
It was brought by a brother officer
who was at his side throughout, and
who escaped while my lad died. I
want to tell you all that he told me.
"Eustace was taken at Weissenburg
on the 4th of August. The prisoners
were broken up into parties and sent
back into Germany by different routes.
Eustace was taken upon the fifth to a
village called Lauterburg, where he
met with kindness from the German
officer in command. This good colonel
had the hungry lad to supper, offered
him the best he had, opened a bottle of
good wine, as I have tried to do for you,
and gave him a cigar from his own
case. Might I entreat you to take one
from mine?"
