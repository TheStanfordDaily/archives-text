The Junior Annual has appeared,
| and those who missed the doubtful
honor of a grind are breathing
, freer. It comes to us in a pretty
i cover of white, gold, and cardinal,
j and it certainly justifies all that
would be expected of it, particularly
j in the line of art work.
The prize poem and the prize
j story are contributed this year by
Irving Outcalt and Dane Coolidge.
Mr. Outealt's poem is in blank
verse, and is smooth and pleasing.
Mr. Coolidge's prize story has the
i merit, uncommon in Stanford fic
-1 lion, of a cogent plot and an accu
rate portrayal of a phase of college
life. Miss Jessie Ryan contributes
! a story of Spanish life, and Miss
Mary L. Meyrick gives a charming
lit t It; fragment full of poetic thought,
I ''The Ghost of Peter Coutts."
In the way of serious verse there
are two poems by E. M. Iluline,
one, a memorial poem to Inland
Stanford Jr., being of s peri a 1 merit;
j'"Venus Anadyomerie" by W. II
j Irwin, and ''Compensation" by C.
K. Field.
Lighter verse is contributed by
I Sara Comstock, Winifred Harper,
Prof. A. W. Smith, and others,
while "Carolu√ü Ager" shows he is
still with us in spirit by several lit
tle verses in his inimitable verse.
The "Grinds" this year are in
, better taste than ever before. The
fun shows a kindly spirit, and few
of the jokes are malicious. As a
| rule, however, the ''co-eds" are
treated a little too roughly.
The art work is fully up to Stan
ford's high standard. "Music" by
Merle Johnson, the class pictures
by Culver, one or two pieces by Miss
| Hyde and Miss Morton, and some
j of McCartney's marine sketches de
serve special notice, while the wash
drawings of Miss I lolley are seldom
surpassed in the best of the Eastern
illustrated magazines.
