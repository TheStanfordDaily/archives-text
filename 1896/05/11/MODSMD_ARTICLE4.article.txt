# Stanford Again the Champion.
## 
### 
The intercollegiate baseball
championship for the year 1896
goes to Stanford. The third and
deciding game at San Jose was
won by a score of 8 to 8, defeating
the University of California for the
fourth consecutive season.
The game was very exciting from
beginning to end. There were so
many intense partisans of one side
or t he other among the two thous
and spectators that the game was
exciting, and besides, it was a very
pretty exhibition of baseball.
Neither side tallied in the first
inning. In the second Sharp drew
a base on balls, stole second, and
scored when Wheeler threw the ball
into center field.
In the first part of the fifth Hong
made a safe hit for U. C. With
one man out Proctor hit a long 11 y
to left. Thompson was hindered
by the bad ground and muffed it
and Hoag scored. Morden struck
out. Bachelder and Wheeler
knocked short bits down the third
base line which McLaine was slow
in handling and the score was tied,
2 to 2.
Bachelder, Wheeler, and Hen
nersy made consecutive hits in the
eighth. With Bachelder on third,
Elston knocked a long 11 y to Free
man, and the runner beat the ball
home. McLaine easily disposed of
the next two men.
Young was first up for Stanford.
Morden threw him a straight high
ball. Young hit it squarely and it
sailed straight on a line to the cen
ter field fence. Proctor ran up on
the bicycle track and as be did so
the ball bounded back over the
track into the field. Young was
already past second and scored
amid the wildest enthusiam.
Thompson made a clean hit to
right. Krug juggled Stansbery's
grounder. Thompson brought in
the winning run on Freeman's
pretty two-bagger to center. Mc-
Laine forced Stansbery on third.
Elston let Taylor's hit get away
from him. .Jeffs followed with a
hard single to left, which Hoag al
lowed to pass him. Jeffs scored on
Morden's error and a wild pitch,
making six runs in the inning on
four hits and four errors.

It is a fitting conclusion for bis
difficult campaign that McLaine
should win the final game by bis
masterly work in the box. Berke
ley's heavy hitters were completely
at his mercy all through the game,
and his hard hitting encouraged his
men to the final rally that won the
championship.
