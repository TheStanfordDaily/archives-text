The German again shook his head.
f!is horror of his companion had in
creased ;»s lie sat watching the lips that
smiled, and the eyes that glared.
"The colonel. ;'s I say. was pood to
my hov. Hut unluckily, the prisoners
were moved next day across the Rhine
to Httlingen. They were not equally
fortunate then.
"The officer who guarded them was
a ruffian and villain, ('apt. Haumgarten.
lie took a pleasure in humiliating and
ill treating the brave men who had
fallen into his power. That night,
up.mi my »on answering fiercely back to
• om-.' taunt of liis, he struck him in the
eye like this."
The crash of the blow rang through
the hall. The German's face fell for
ward. ins hand up, and blood oozing l
through his lingers. The count set
tled down in his chair once more.
"My boy was disfigured by the blow,
and this villain made his appearance
the object of his jeers. By the way,
you look a little comical yourself at
the present moment, captain, and your
colonel would certainly say that you
had been getting into mischief. To
continue, however, my boy's youth and
his destitution—for his pockets were
empty — moved the pity of a kind
hearted major and he advanced him
ton napoleons from his own pocket
without security of any kind. Into
your hands, ('apt. Haumgarten, I re
turn these ten gold pieces, since I can
not learn the name of the lender. I am
grateful from my heart for this kind
ness shown to my boy.
"The vile tyrant who commanded the
escort accompanied the prisoners to
Durlach. and from there to Carlsrnhe.
lie heaped every outrage upon my lad,
because the spirit of the Chateaux-
Xoirs would not stoop to turn away his
wrath by a feigned submission. Aye.
this cowardly villain, whose heart's
blood shall still clot upon this hand,
dared to strike my son with his open
hand, to kick nim, to tear hairs from
his mustache —to use him thus —and
thus and thus!''
The German writhed and struggled,
lie was helpless in the hands of this huge
giant, whose blows were raining upon
him. When at last, blinded and half
senseless, he staggered to his feet it
was only to be hurled back again into
the great oaken chair, lie sobbed in
his impotent anger and shame.
"My boy was frequently moved to
tears by the humiliation of his posi
tion," continued the count. "You will
understand v. lieu I say that it is a bit
ter thing to be helpless in the hands of
an insolent and remorseless enemy.
On arriving at Carlsrnhe, however, his
face, which had been wounded
by the brutality of his guard, was
hound up by a young Bavarian sub
altern. who was touched by his appear
ance. I regret to see that your eye is
bleeding so. Will you permit me to
bind it with tnv ilk handkerchief?"

He leaned forward, but the German
dashed his hand aside. "I am in your
power, you monster!" he cried. "I can
endure your brutality, but not your
hypocrisy."
