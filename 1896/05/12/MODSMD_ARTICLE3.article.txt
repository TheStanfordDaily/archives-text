The Stanford track management
have decided upon still another
method for raising finances for the
Eastern trip ami desire the cooper
ation of all students to assist them.
The management is going into the
trunk-moving business and will ask
all who intend to leave the Univer
sity for the summer vacation to give
all trunks and packages to them.
The price per trunk from any point
in I'aloAlto, Mayfield, or on the
campus, to the depot will be 25
cents per parcel. Don't give your
baggage to any one else unless you
have no desire to help the track
men East. Blanks will soon be
distributed so that you may get
your orders on file at an early date.
