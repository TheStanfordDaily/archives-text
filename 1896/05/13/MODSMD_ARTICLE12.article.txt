The neat little volume of poems
published by Charles K. Field, 'i) 5,
entitled ''Kour-leafed ('lover," is
meeting with much praise and the
sale has been successful. Stanford
has had no poet as yet whose verse
is so tilled with Stanford sentiment
as that of Carolus Ager, and it is
gratifying to Stanford students to
know that its merits are recognized.
