With this issue the Daily I'ai.o
Alto ceases regular publication for
the semester. The Commencement
Edition which is to appear on May
27, is a special issue which is to fur
nish a record of the events, cere
monies, and addresses of the week.
In this final edition it is perhaps
pertinent to make a brief state
ment.
Few persons outside those di
rectly connected with the college
daily have any idea of the amount
of work necessary to give them all
the college news each evening. A
great deal depends upon the staff
of associates and assistants, and
their efforts are seldom understood
by the outsider. Their work ex
tends throughout the college year,
and the time they put on the paper
exceeds that put in by any candi- |
date fora Varsity team. What
they do, however, receives no credit
and no reward beyond the honor of
a connection with the paper and a
pleasure in seeing a good paper
published. The present staff has
l>een conscientious and loyal, which
meant much to tlie paper during the
semester and means more for fu
ture administrations. To the
members of that staff, with whom
it has been a pleasure to work, we
wish to express our appreciation
and gratitude.
