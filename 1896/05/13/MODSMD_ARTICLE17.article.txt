Kclitor Daily Palo Alto:
My recent purchase of 125 slum s
of Co-op. stock seems to have
caused some persons to doul>t the
sincerity of Mr. /ion's efforts to
abolish the proxy system and place
elections entirely in the hands of
resident shareholders. In view of
which I desire t»> state that my pur
chase of these shares was made
without Mr. Zion's knowledge or
desire. .1. K. Baunett.
