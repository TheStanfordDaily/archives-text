"I suit taking things in their order,
just sis they occurred," said he."I
wijs under vou to tell it to the first
<icrman oiiicer with whom I could talk
tete-a-tete. Let me see, 1 had got so
far as the young Bavarian at Carlsruhe.
I regret extremely that you will not
permit mi' to use such slight skill in
: urgery as I possess. At Carlsruhe my
hid was shut up in the old caserne,
v. here he remained fora fortnight.
The worst pang «>f his captivity was
that some unmannerly curs in the gar
rison would taunt him with his position
;is lie sat by his window in the evening.
That reminds me. captain, that you are
not <jnite situated upon a bed of roses
yourself, are. you now? Vou came to .
trap a wolf, my man. and now tlie
beast has you down with his fangs in
your throat. A family man, too. I
should judge, bv the well-tilled tunic.
Well, a widow the more will make lit
tle matter, and they do not usually re
main widows lony. Get back into the
chair, you dog"!
"Well, to continue my story, at tin
em! of a fortnight inv son and his
friend escaped. I need not trouble you
with the danpfers which they ran or the
privations which they endured Sullice
it to say that to disguise themselves
they had to take the clothes of two
peasants, whom they waylaid in a
wood. Hiding by day and traveling by
night, they had got. as far into France
as Bemilly. and were within a mile a
single mile, captain of crossing the
Herman lines, when a patrol of Fhlans
came ri;rht upon them. Oh. it was ;
hard. w;:s it not. when they had come i
so far and were so near to safety!" The
count blew a double call upon his
whistle, and three hard faced peasants
entered the room.
"These must represent my Uhlans.'"
said lie "Well. then, the captain in
command, finding that these men were j
French soldiers in civilian dress within
the Herman lines, proceeded to hang
them without trial or ceremony I
think. Jean, that the center beam is
the shortest."
The unfortunate soldier was dragged
from his. chair to where a noosed rope
had been Hung over one of the huge
oaken rafters which spanned the room
The cord was slipped over his head,
and he felt its harsh grip round his
throat The three peasants seized the
other end, and looked to the count for
his orders.
The officer, pale but firm, folded his
arms and stared defiantly at the man
who tortured him
"Vou are now face to face with death,
and I perceive from your lips that you
are praying. My son was also face
to face with death and he prayed al«o
It happened that a general officer came
up and he heard the lad praying for his
mother, and it moved him so lie being
himself a father that lie ordered his
I'hians away and iie remained with his

IOOPYHICHT. IHM-1

aide decamp only beside the con
demned man. And when he heard all
the lad had to tell, that he wasth >
only child of an old family, and that
his mother was in failing health, lie
threw off the rope as I throw oil" thi .
and he kissed him on either cheek as I
kiss you. and he bade him go as I hi !
you go. and may every kind wish of
that noble general, though it could not
stave off the fever which slew my son,
descend now upon your head."
And so it was that ("apt. Baumgar

staggered out into the wind and the
rain of that wild December dawn.
