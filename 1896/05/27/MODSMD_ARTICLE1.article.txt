# COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS.
## Scholarly Discourse by Professor Anderson. 
### 
The following abstract of the
Commencement Address was sub-|
mitted through the kindness of j
Prof. Anderson who, for certain j
reasons, preferred that the entire j
address should not be published in
this edition. He promises, however,
that it will appear at some time in '
some form. The outline gives but 1
a faint idea of the true merit of the I
address.
It is well understood by scholars
that the great works of the creative
imagination are not necessarily
simple or easy of interpretation;
nay, that different interpretations
of the same masterpiece may sev
erally have their justification ac
cording to the point of view. Such
products of the human genius re
semble the phenomena of nature,
respecting which philosophers pro
pound from age to age their vary
ing theories. Such master-work
may be compared to a vast moun
tain, towering northward; a mere
wall of rock, while its southern
Hank smiles with the wealth of ver
dure: on the landward side ap
proachable and neighborly, while
to the mariner far out at sea it
looms vague and gigantic amid the
clouds.
Scholars are not at one as to the
significance of the Iliad, of the
Prometheus, of the Divina Cotne
dia, or even of so recent a work as
Faust; yet in the reading of any of
them the way-faring man, if not a
fool, need not err. So every reader
feels that of all the wonderful
dreams of Shakspere none is more
picturesque and significant than
the play of Hamlet. And if schol
ars of different times, tempera
ments, and nationalities have
reached widely varying conclusions
as to the character of the hero, we
feel that the very fact is evidence
of the breadth of the author's con
ception and the naturalness of his
art. This fascinating creation is
clothed with the something of the
mystery with which Nature herself
forever allures and forever baffles.
The meaning of natural objects
seems plain to the superficial. The
allusion of familiarity is the first
and last thing the observer has to
guard against. So Hamlet seems
and is full of significance to the boy
who reads it for the first time; hut
it Ins not been given to Coleridge,
not to Schlegel, not to Lowell, not
to <ioethe even, to quite "pluck out
the heart" of Hamlet's mystery.
*****
The two propositions to which
I can reduce my theory are, stated
in the most naked terms, as fol
lows:
First. The fundamental concep
tion of the author in the play of
Hamlet is to represent draniati
caIIy the forces of education through
circumstances, by means of which
the born idealist and dreamer is
transformed into the man of action
and character. To put it in another
way, this play describes a course of
experience whereby a young prince
of imaginative temperament, to
whom ''there is nothing either good
or bad but thinking makes it so,"' is
developed, if not into a hero, at
least into a resolute man to whom

thi' test of good anil bud is some
thing more than a merely subject
ive one.
Second. The inner experience of
Hamlet in undergoing this process!
of education, his hesitation, his
fears, his scruples, his agonies, his
unsettlement of mind, his thoughts,
of suicide, and finally his steady,
victorious emergence from the''sea
of troubles" —iill this had its par
allel in the secret experience of
Shakspere during those long years!
when lie was slowly working his
way out of the halfness of the
dreamer into the wholeness of
which his life-dream became so!
unique an example. As an ideal
ization of this struggle toward a
rounded manhood —a struggle the
more solemnly real and impressive
in Hamlet's case because death
stepped in before the victory was j
complete-—the story of Hamlet may
be said to represent that of his au
thor. Let me insist that it is in
the large and ideal sense rather
than in those details of experience!
wherein others have found the par
allel to lie —that Hamlet is Shaks
pere.
Of these two propositions let us
begin with the second. Although
the former is quite independent of
the latter, vet of course any par
allel that can be drawn between
the inner life of Hamlet and that
of his Creator may furnish proof
presumptive that the play was
written in order to dramatically
represent such a process of spiritual
development. Consider what is
known of Shakspere's early life.
Outwardly, to he sure, it was as far
as possible from being like that of
the melancholy Dane. Hut what
chieHy concerns us is Shakspere's
inner life, his dream-world, which
j constantly tilled a considerable
part of the first twenty years of his
! existence. How peremptorily all
! distinction of rank and fortune are
levelled in the dream-world we
learn from the fairy tales, which, as
it has been beautifully said, are
; ''made out of the dreams of the poor."
Prince Hamlet could have had no
more magnificent idealization of
himself in his dreams than could
William Shakspere. Though
bounded in a nutshell he could ac
count himself a king of infinite
space. lb-owning doubtless gives
us a substantially more faithful
picture of Shakspere than any bio
graphy could give.

Prof. Anderson then went on to
draw an extended analogy between
; Shakspere and the career of Ham
let*
The progress made by Hamlet
in reconciling the conditions of the
contemplative life may perhaps be
most efficiently shown by a brief
review of the eight soliloquies. It
is significant that the lirst three all
begin with "O! " to express despair,
honor, disgust, self-distrust.
******
The historical noteof these early
soliloquies is a profound touch of
Nature. It should not for a mo
ment be forgotten how t rving a re t he
circumstances amid which Hamlet
subjects himself to the stern dis
cipline that at first must be cau
tious and tentative, and then when
the time conies, prompt and de
cisive.

The purely meditative charac-;
ter of the fifth soliloquy '"To bel
or not to l>e"—is in line contrast '
with the following scene with
Ophelia, in which Hamlet's irri
tated nerves hurry him into such an j
exaggeration of his role of mad
man.
******
The sixth soliloquy breathes'
the pure spirit of profound passion
curbed with iron determination.
The seventh, when he discovers
the king at prayer, is more discur
sive, but surely Hamlet here ex-!
liibits his self-restraint.
The eighth and last soliloquy i
pronounced as he is on the point of
embarking for England is again!
nobly discursive. Hut it has no j
touch of hysteria. Its self-rebuke |
is calm and manlv in tone.
******
Hamlet's final soliloquy con
tains no trace of his supposed inde
cision of character: it is mainly his
ultimate justification to himself.
******
Hamlet makes no plans, con
ceives no purpose, from the begin
ning to the end of the dream, which
he does not, carry out. Of such
purposes, requiring for their execu
tion the great qualities of caution,
tact, patience, and courage, all com
bined, there are at least six: First.
The purpose of meeting and speak
ing with the ghost. Second. The
plan of adopting the mask of simu
lated insanity. Third. The plan of
catching the conscience of the king
j by means of the play. Fourt h.
1 The purpose to speak daggers to
his mother, but to use none. Fifth.
The masterly ci>v/> (properly
planned beforehand) by means of
which he punishes his would-be ex
ecutioners and gets himself brought
| back by the pirates. Sixth. The
purpose of adhering, despite his
own misgivings and the suggestions
of Horatio, to the proposed duel
j with Laertes, by which the execu
tion of his great purpose was to be
brought about in a way so unfore
seen, at the expense of so great a
sacrifice.
