Secondary education lias been
quick to respond to the new plan of
entrance requirements adopted by
President Jordan and his associates
at the opening of the University;
but there is prohably no better in
dex of the changes wrought in the
preparation of students than the
school that was founded with the
avowed purpose of preparing boys
for Stanford University. Although
it has no official connection with
the University, it should have been
expected that Manzanita Hall
would reflect in its development
and the degree of its prosperity the
effects of the new plan. In its or
ganization it aimed to become to
Stanford what many of the best
older academies of the East are to
some of the eastern universities
wliat Phillips Andover Academy
has long been to Vale, and what
Uascadilla has become to Cornell.
Without ostentation of any kind
the school has now closed its third
year, and has produced results that
can be tested. Its flexible course
of study, its careful attention to
the needs of the individual, its per
sistent refusal to offer a smattering
of anything, its plan of concentrat
ing the student's attention upon
few subjects at a time, have all
been in a measure the direct out
come of the new plan of University
entrance requirements.
The success of the school has
been due in large part, also, to the
principle that has guided in the se
lection of teachers. The work in
each subject is placed in the hands
of a specialist who is himself mak
ing advanced researches in the
same line. The result of the gen
eral policy has been that the close
relations between the school and
the University have become more
marked with each year, and Man
zanita Hall has become a steady
feeder to the University. The as
pirations of the students are di
rected hit herward, and the teachers
are loyal to Stanford interests.
There could be no better justifica
tion of the policy of the school, and
no better proof that its work is
done by vigorous intellects, than
the fact that three of its teachers
have recently been appointed as in
structors or assistants in the Uni
versity itself for the coming year.
While the school has been estab
lishing such pleasant intellectual
relations and binding itself to the
University by the traditions of both
teachers and students, other inter
ests have helped to draw it more
closely to the University. One of
its students has been throughout
the year a member of the Univer
sity orchestra, and one of its former
students, now a freshman, won the
fourteen points that tied the score
of the intercollegiate field-day this
year.
