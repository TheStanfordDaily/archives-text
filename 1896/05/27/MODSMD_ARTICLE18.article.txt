Stanford has now sent forth two
classes, both of which have spent
full four years in study within her
various departments. No college
ever sent forth better exemplars of
what tiiat college itself stood for or
the character and standard of its
work, than has Stanford in her
"pioneers" and their immediate
successorsâ€”the '9G graduates. The
members of these classes were pres
ent during the most anxious period
of the University's history, and
each of them came to feel, as in
tensely as any individual could
feel, that their alma mater it inter
ests were their own. What won
der then that having thus become
so closely identified with their col
lege's cause they have proved such
staunch adherents in every way,
both while attending college and
while absent.
A college, like an individual, can
never have one friend too many,
and is bound to meet enemies at
all times. It is fortunate, there
fore, for Stanford that she can
send forth such representatives and
defenders of her reputation and
honor as she has done in those of
and".ML
There is an infinite amount of
good which the first classes can do
and which will redound to the
credit of the University. Every
institution of learning expects cer
tain things of its graduates, and
has a right, to do so, in reward for
the long years it has toiled with
and for them. First, it expects
that their conduct and work in the
practical world may always be
pointed to with pride; that no
graduate shall ever by thoughtless
deportment or ignoble deed shame
and sully the fair fame of his men
tor. Second, it expects, so far as
lies within each graduate's power,
that he or she will retain sufficient,
interest in the college or university
to exert themselves in her cause.
Action counts for most, out, words
too are not valueless when uttered
at the right season. Third, that
they will direct students of the
right sort to that university to
which they themselves are most in
debted, and further, that they will
exercise a kindly regard of those
who follow after them, thus build
ing up that fraternal sentiment
which is of so much importance to
the progress of all great educational
institutions.

As w;is said before, Stanford can
feel perfectly safe of such support
from her first graduating classes,
but they must exceed rather than
fall below these demands, for they
are entrusted with the responsibil
ity of setting an example which
later classes must follow. By
placing the standard high they
honor not themselves alone but all
who succeed them.
Future classes will see this Uni
versity far larger and far wider re
nowned than those who are now
leaving the walls made dear by so
many memorable associations; but
none will ever leave with more sin
cere affection for their alnxi mater
and more earnest intentions of ad
vancing her name, than the class
of "96.
