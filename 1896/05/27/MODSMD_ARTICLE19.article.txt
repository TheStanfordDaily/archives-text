# The
						Vaudeville Performance.
## 
### 
On Tuesday evening, May 19, a
select few gathered at Encina gym
nasium to witness one of the most
enjoyable vaudeville exhibitions
ever presented by Stanford students.
The program was arranged with
Care, and each number was pre
sented with much more earnestness
and energy than generally char
acterizes these hastily planned
shows. It was unfortunate that *o
few students turned out, as the pro
ceeds were badly needed to aid the
track men in the accumulation of a
fund for the Eastern trip, and but
little more was taken in from
the sale of tickets than was
necessary to defray the ex
penses of the evening. I'ndouht
edly the failure—financially speak
ing—was due to the press of linn 1
examinations and the proximity
of home-going.
Among special features of the
program, of more than usual merit,
were the rendition of "Estudian
tina/' by the (ilee and Mandolin
Clubs, and the violin solo by W.
Hittle Wells. The fourth number
on the program—the Harvard
(iavotte —was a revelation to those
who believed the Ladies' Mandolin
Club was at all behind the men's
mandolin aggregation. For style
and artistic finish this was the peer
of any musical number on the pro
gram.
The tumbling of N. A. Carle and
A. C. (iamer merited the applause
given. Several of the fancy feats
were far more dillicult than they
appeared, and were the best acts of
that character in which the gym
nasium athletes have appeared.
C. \V. 1 letherington's club swing
ing was of the professional kind
and was much admired for its grace
a ml dexterity.
