# SENIORS DEFEAT THE FACULTY.
## An Interesting Game Between the Nines and How It Was Played. 
### 
A very large crowd \v;is on iiaml
at the diamond last Saturday
morning to witness the customary
game between the Senior nine and
anaggregation of professors. Among
those present, in addition to stu
dents ;i nd professors and their
families, were many visitors from
neighboring towns. I ndoubtedlv
there were more spectators about
the diamond than ;tt any other
game of the season and everybody
had enough to laugh at to prevent
ennui.
The Senior nine w;is togged out
in lounging suits of nil colors, and
which, while just the thing for the
smoking-room, appeared most gro
tesque on the diamond. All the
men had blackened their faces and
the result was that a casual ob
server might have supposed that
the Faculty was struggling against
a minstrel show or an Ethiopian
nine. It was most amusing to see
the professors, who had become a
hit stift" poring over their books,
racing around the field after long
Hies or hot grounders. They played
a much better game than was ex
pected, however, and the final score,
2X to 2->, shows that the 'HO team
had no wa Ik-over.
Prof. Murray was first at but and
took his base on balls, got round to
third on passed balls and scored on
Morrison's wild throw to first, while
the crowd yelled,'"Murray, Murray,
good boy Murray.' In the mean
time Richardson had followed Mur
ray's example and Prof, lloskins
had reached second. 1)r. Jordan
came to the bat and hit at the ball
ineffectively a couple of times, but
not linding it profitable, contented
himself with a base on balls, let
ting.left's do the base running for
him. lloskins came in on a passed
ball, Yanderveer being a little
wild, and Prof. Fish went out on an
easy hit to Yanderveer.
I he Seniors in their halfgave up
easy. Frankenheimer flew out,
Nagel died while stealing second
from Angell, McLaine got as far as
third, but was left there by Rey
nolds, who st ruck out.
In the second inning Prof. Young
flew out, Prof. Angell failed to reach
lirst, and Murray got first on balls
only to be left thereby Prof. Itich
ardson, who st ruck out.
The Seniors by a few heavy hits
rattled the tutors in their half and
scored six runs before they were
stopped. Fife, Campbell. Yander
veer, Frankenheimer, and Me! aine
all got hits off Prof. Kellogg's de
livery and two or three others got
bases on balls.
In the first of the third the
Faculty evened matters up by scor
ing three runs after both Profs.
Kellogg and lloskins had gone out.
I >r. .lonian's substitute scored and
Wood and Fish each made a cir
cuit.
The Seniors warmed up again
and increased their lead two runs.
Fife hit a little fly and Kellogg and
Angell did their best to prevent
each other from letting each other
get it. lie stole second and third
and came in on a wild throw and
Ya nderveer ea me i n on a sacri lice bv
Hicks. Morrison was caught nap
ping by Angell at second and
Nagel hit out.
In the fourth inning I>r. Jordan
and Prof Angell each made safe
hits and both scored, again tying
the score. Kellogg Mew out, and
Wood and Fish breathed their last
at second.
The Seniors again made a run in
their half. McLaine hit out a long

fly to center field which Dr. Jordan
failed to stop, Reynolds, Fife,
Ya nderveer, and Frankenheimer all
hitting safe and nett ing five •■uiis.
The Faculty managed to make
two runs in the fifth on clever base
stealing by Prof. Angell and by
Prof. Kellogg's long hit.
It was in the second half of the
fifth that the Seniors got in their
deadly work. The inning opened
up dubiously, for McLaine struck
out, but Reynolds redeemed the
team by making a home run. Fife
hit safe for two bags and came
home on Campbell's strike, who
went out at second. However, Yan
derveer lined out a safety, as did
Morrison, Hicks. Frankenheimer,
McLaine, Nagel, Reynolds, and
Fife, and Campbell again. W hen
the Faculty recovered and the
smoke clea red awav the score stood
28 to 10.
The sages went in for gore in the
sixth and did a little acting them
selves. Dr. Jordan got to lirst on
balls (Jeffs running the bases),
stole second, and made home on
Dr. Wood's two-bagger. Fish went
to first on balls, and Young hit safe,
bringing in Wood. Fish reaching
third. Angell filled up the bases,
and Murray brought in two men on
his two-base hit. Richardson also
made a safe hit, and Angell and
Murray scored. Kellogg and llos
kins made safe tries at Yander
vcer's curves, and a couple more
tallies resulted.
I n their half of the sixth t lie Sen
iors increased their lead two points,
and the Faculty did likewise in
their turn at the bat in the seventh;
but the graduates were not satisfied
yet and added on three more scores.
Campbell and Morrison each made
hits that were good three-baggers,
but were caught out at the plate by
trying to stretch their hits into
home runs.
At the beginning of the eighth
the professors opened up with
enough hits to increase their record
to 28 tallies, and here the teams
rested on their honors, neither side
being able to make the circuit in
t lie remaining innings.
