The eloseiicss of this year's I»;i s«*-
1 >;i 11 race with Berkeley will 111; ik
interestiii}. r tlie following tallies of
the work of Stanford's team in the
three intercollegiate contests.
Young did the most effective hat
ting, closely followed oy MeLaine.
Sharp and Taylor did ijiiite well,
considering the weakness of left
handed hatsnien against a left
handed pitcher. Taylor led in run

getting ami bases on balls. The
stick work of the three out-liehlers,
Freeman, Thompson, and Slans
bery, was very poor. Freeman and
Thompson, however, redeemed
themselves slightly in the San Jose
game. Staiisberv did well on the
bases. The club hatting was 200,
and Berkeley's 2 ( .tX.
Free: n an did the best field ing of t he
three outfielders. error
was not costly, but Thompson's cost
two runs. Young was not quite up
to standard on first, and Jeffs, while
good on fouls, was weak in throw
ing. Sharp's playing was good
throughout the series. McLaine
handled grounders well in the first
games, but was slow in the final.
Taylor made his errors in the lirst
game wh«m he was not well. Har
ris, on second, was nervous in the
first two games, but at San Jose
his work was exceptionally good.
He will prove a strong man next
vea r.
The fielding, all considered, was
much better than the batting. Club
fielding was .X ( .l">, as against Ber
keley's .XXX.
