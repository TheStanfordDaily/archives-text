The under classmen had the

theniselves and they appeared t<>
enjoy t lie occasion thoroughly.
Sophomore and freslmian, dressed
in Indian costume, danced together
around the camp-lire, said Haltering
things to each other, and parted at
last, each happy that trihal war
had ceased. After a year of oppo
sition they were readv fora love
feast, and they had it.
The hraves hegan to gather in
the <|Uadrangle at ahout eight
o'clock. After making several
trips around the quadrangle a bon
fire was started on the site of the
chapel that is to he, and the braves
surrounded il. The large number
of spectators who had now as
sembled crowded round from all
sides and standing room was at a
premium.

interrupted by grunts of approval
from the braves, while the squaws
in the audience looked on and
smiled.

Tomato-Can-Lawyer Flias. Flias
said that "1)V) was willing to meet
'9N on any field. Mn //-field was
suggested as a good meeting-place
by a sophomore in the crowd.
The hatchet was now buried, and
along with it a list of things which
had been a thorn in the flesh of
the under classmen. Among these
were the Meyer and Rosenberg
snipe hunt, llodges' dog, Cicero's
sophomore cane, A bey Meyer's fra
ternity, the Chora] Society, and all
reference in the future to "'l4 ().''

Foot Irwin then proposed to
smoke the pipe of peace, a
proposition which found ready
acceptance with 1 lea p- Lose-' In i-
Wanipuni liradlev, who took
occasion to tell how he had been
maltreated by the sophomores.
After this love-feast and while
the pipe of peace was being smoked
by the chiefs there was a war da nee
a roil ml I he eanip-fi re I>v the bra ves,
and a general scramble for the
" 'baccy" and souvenir pipes. In
this scrimmage three members of
the committee were at the bottom
of the pile, and were saved from
being crushed only by the strong
right arm of Esquimaux Charlie
Fickert, who made a large hole in
the crowd in a remarkably short
space of time.
The success this year is largely
due to the persevering efforts of the
two committees and the interest
taken m the matter by the Class of
