tercollegiate debaters of Stanford

breakfast by Warren Olnev of San
Francisco. Mr. Olnev has shown
in the past his great interest in the
art of debating and in many wa\s
he has striven to encourage inter
collegiate debates. A college man
himself and the father of a Berke
ley student, he has been inclose re
lationship with college men and

college interests a good many years
of his life.
It was he who last year ban
queted the intercollegiate debaters;
and the fact that he was again the
host this year shows that lie is de-1
sirous of making this a custom !
each year which the debaters can |
look forward to with pleasure. I
Mr. ()lney is a most cultured,courte-,
ous gentleman, and all thanks are!
due him by all collegians for the i
incentive he has offered in many
ways t<> college debating contests.
This last breakfast was an elab
orate affair. The University Club's
rooms were artistically decorated
for the occasion with college colors,
among which those of Stanford and
Berkeley prevailed.

master, and among those who re
