# Prospective Stanford Buildings
## 
### 
There will he no buildings con
structed on the campus this sum
mer. It is recognized that there is
urgent need of several but the con
dition of the estate and other fac
tors will not permit any extensive
work within the next year. The
buildings most needed and proba
bly the first to he erected will be a
chemical laboratory, an audito
rium, and the new chapel. The
present quarters of the chemistry
department are inadequate to its
expanding needs, and by the care
lessness of some students the stone
work has been stained by acids.
There is great need of an audito
rium of good capacity to accomo
date the many gatherings of the
students during the year.
Mr. llodges, when asked about
prospective buildings, said, " I can
give you nothing definite as to when
building will commence. However,
nothing will he done this summer.
We have received bids fora frame
auditorium to be built on the west
side of the quadrangle. This build
ing will probably go up soon.
There has been some talk of a chem
istry laboratory but no work has
been done toward it. When this
building is put up it will be of
stone and situated on the west side
of the quadrangle."
