The dedication of the '')(» brass
plate in front of the prospective
chapel took place i 11 t lie quadrangle
Monday afternoon. The plate is
in the form of a hlock and is sup
stituted in the sidewalk of the ar
cade for one of the concrete Mocks.
It hears the inscription "''.Mi."
President li. L. Wilbur called
the meeting to order and in a few
well chosen remarks explained
that the graduating class had es
tablished this precedent of dedicat
ing a hlock of brass to the Univer
sity and trusted future classes to
continue to do this for all time.
The class history was written by
Miss < J race F. Clark and was read
by John (iregory. In brief form it
set forth the achievements of the
class from entrance to its exit— its
work in Ihe class-room; the work
of its members as debaters against
Berkeley; the work on the college
papers; and its athletic powers on
track and Held; from all these
things it begged to be rightly judged.
Prof. Karl Barnes then read an
admirable address. He empha
sized the fact that students too
often failed lo recognize that gradu
ation is the severest examination
that the student can undergo. He
then advised the graduates of those
essential qualities which they
should possess in order to be cap
able of graduating with knowledge
and understanding which they
should have. He emphasized the
necessity of self-understanding—
"rational self-consciousness, tem
pered and sweetened with hope and
faith." Vet college men are too
often seen walking about blind to
their own souls. "To an intel
lectual life the greatest good that
comes to us is to have formulated
some philosophy of life."
l'rof. Barnes then showed the
needs of having a man's real in
timates- "'the invisiblecompanions
of his solitude" chosen from the
best of literature and of art. Love
is necessary to this choice and
power to attract love from others
is a still greater virtue. This
power is the great interpreter of
life, "ll is tnis same great gift of
loving which has given us the Uni
versity and all the attending bless
ings which have been ours during
the years of our studentship." The
speaker then asserted that the past
four years should have given to
each graduate these essential qual
ities, and once possessed t hey confer
the right to lead and rule the world.
I lie class song by J. A. Tucker
to the tune of "'Vive la eonipagnie"
followed.
'"The Last Will and Testament"
by .1. A.Tucker was read, and only
lack of space prevents ils presenta
tion in full
11. 11. Brown then stepped to the
platform and delivered in an ad
mirable manner an eloquent
address dedicating the block
to the University. This address
was the most enjoyable oj e of the
afternoon and lack of space only
prevents it:- publication in full.
The speaker called attention to
the fact of the proximity of final
departure from the college walls
made dear by association; il
lustrated the students life by com
parison with the tree which is in
clined as it is bent while yet a
twig; and referred to what Stan
ford might expect from such a class
as '!)(>, judging its proud record in
this University. He showed the
benefits over those of older colleges
which are bound down into fixed
grooves by hoarv tradition. < iuided
by true Stanford sentiment, with
which all graduates must have be
come saturated, failure should be
impossible

The speaker then stepped down
and unveiled the plate, continuing
—'"We unveil this plate of metal
(and present it to our ulma muter
'as a token of everlasting devotion
land loyalty. To the donors it
marks a beginning and an ending.
College days are over and we must
enter the rough and tumble of life,
j But in a sense it will be history re
peating itself. Tomorrow you and
I will be freshmen again. We
shall be looked upon as uncouth
j and untried, we shall be laughed
at, imposed upon, and disap
pointed. Then will come the soph-
I omore, the junior, and the senior
; periods; the conclusion, full, event
| ful, intense lives."
Mr. Brown then spoke of the ex
pectations of 'V)(» in seeing the line
|of metal blocks grow longer and
j longer, and when the ninetieth
| block shall have been dedicated
! 'yc> will be forgotten. "(fenerations,
centuries shall come and go, for
they are short in the lives of a great
ilistitn ion; and when at length the
I line of blocks encircles the entire
! quadrangle the memory of this day
will be lost in the legends of the
past; forgotten the tales of today;
j forgotten the origination of the
custom; forgotten the officers of the
I class; forgotten all: but '''.Mi'will
still remain embedded in the rock."
Dr. Jordan, on behalf of the Uni
versitv, accepted the gift in a
speech half humorous, half pa
thetic. He told how he had come
j to consider the quadrangle as his
i castle, and he hoped that all who
entered t liese gates for study should
also conn; to hold it as their
castle.
The exercises concluded with
! '"Hail, Stanford, I lail."
