On Monday evening the Class of
".Mi held its final ball. It was a
complete triumph in every way.
Fncina's large dining-room had
been obtained for the occasion, and
its decorations of flowers and greens
and drapings made it an ideal
place for such a function. I'otted
plants had been arranged in such a
way as to make the dancing por
tion of the room circular in form,
and notwithstanding there were
some seventy-five couples on the
floor, it was not in the least
crowded. The lobby, too, had been
decorated, and the broad corridor
in front of the ha II had been ar â– 
ranged with tables and chairs for
those who tired of the floor.
There were twenty-four regular
dances on the program, alternating
waltzes and two-steps. 'Two extras
and one grab were all that could be
arranged for beyond the regulars
No better dance music was ever
furnished here than by Schmidt's
musicians, who 11 a< 1 been selected
