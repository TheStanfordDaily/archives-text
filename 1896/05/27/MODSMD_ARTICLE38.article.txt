# The 						Baccalaureate Sermon.

### 
On Sunday morning tin* chapel
was crowded to its utmost capacity
liy admirers of Rev. Horatio Steb-
Jmiis, who delivered the baccalaure
ate sermon, in substance as follows:
"Because he has set his love
upon me, therefore will I deliver
him. I will set, him on high, he
cause he has known niv power, lie
shall call upon me and I will an
swer him. 1 will he with him in
trouble. I will deliver him and
honor him. With long life will I
satisfy him, and show him my sal
vation."
lo the intellect alone religion
makes an evil, even conceited as
sumption; yet it proves to he man's
greatest reward, assuages his
troubles, calms the deepest disturb
ances of his being—and this with
out a word of explanation or apol
ogy. It offers no proofs and af
firms there can he no proof but the
consent of the heart domesticated
in the temple which encloses it.
The reason of it is the child's
reason. "It is so because it is so."
lint to the able, inquiring intellect
this violates reason, is no reason,
but simply a mist that has formed
over all our great primal belief,
which says, "Trust and live." Hut
the profouiulest answer to the pro
foundest things is forever t he child's
answer, ' It is so because it is so,"
and the wisdom of life is in tinding
out that this answer is profound
and true.
Now religion, with no dogmatic
seat of knowledge or exclusive
truth, but with a general dignity of
self-possession, is the sense of safetv
in (iod safety from the storm and
peril of evil. What explanation do
we need for this? People all know
that evil is a fact, that the world is
full of trouble, that every jov has a
corresponding pain The silent
seas whisper not a word of pity for
the empty ships and all the wealth
of precious life and love that sleeps
in its sunless caverns; pestilence
and famine flv like destroying an
gels from city to city, from conti
nent to continent. Hut all this
seems too vast for us to he brought
into personal relationship with it.
Look into the life of despondent in
dividuals and behold t lie bitterness
and the amount of physical suffer
ing and exquisite grief. The ex
perience of all mankind, of all gen
erations of the world, will not
reveal it to an individual heart.
Now, 1 am not picturing life in
melancholy colors to you, nor am 1
striking any uote of despair. The
world is beautiful and lovely, and
it is pleasant to behold its suns.
The nature that (iod has given us,
the constitutions in which he hits
placed us, are things that we must
accept of —things, however, far be
yond our personal faculties to recon
cile or account for. The man who
has solved the problem of evil, as
we call it, and reconciled it with
the goodness of (iod, can boast that
he understands the Almighty to
perfection. But such boasting is a
delusion, or a trick of deceit.
The facts which we all havedaily
to accept, the joy and the sorrow of
daily life- these are the profound
facts. No reason can say why the
present moral discipline prevails
with us. We can wonder why this
i> so, and we can say how (iod
misfit nave made this universe, and
how he might have so endowed us
that we should have encountered
less exposure, les- pain. But this
is only an indirect way of offering
(iod our advice, or suggesting that
he has made a mistake. The more
reasonable course is for us to reflect
that finite beings like ourselves
must sometime come to something
that we do not and can not know;
that what we can not fathom is
not necessarily unfathomable.
Yet that which is withheld from
us does not in the least condemn
the goodness of (iod. I here is wis
dom and goodness round us every
where. But it requires to be laid
hold of by the heart, and felt; and
it is right here in looking for the
evidences of the goodness of (iod
that religion comes to our relief
and offers to us the true principle
of life. It is in our condition of
trial and exposure that appears the
verv ground reason for religion; if
we were not ignorant and depend
ent we would not have any need
of a (iod-religion, which is the con
sciousness of our weakness, and the
inspire! - of our beings. The char
acter of what we call evidence or
proof, however, is sometimes much
misunderstood. It can not be con
tended that what is founded ascer
tains is only likelihood, although
coinplete certainty is only a very
small part of our knowledge. We
apprehend far more than we com
prehend. and the comprehended
soon becomes certainty while the
apprehended goes on forever and
ever. The geometer can say that a
fact is, and tell why it is, but that
kind of knowledge is very limited.
The laws of natural science are de
ductions from experience, but when
we are asked why our experience
has been such we have no answer:
pressed to a last resort we can only
say "force," which is only a philo
sophical way of saying. "1 don't
know."' All we can say about grav
itation is that things do gravitate.
These great physical facts are said
to be the result of personal will; we
accept them as such without asking
why. But what we do not know
surely may not be unknown to a
higher intelligenee.
I n I hi i l< I i ug up ibis cert a in
knowledge much depends on the
human will and intelligence, which
are varying a iid uncertain things.
The science of social life is founded
on known duty, of which the world
as a whole knows as yet practically
nothing. But religion, through
known duty and apprehension of
(iod and truth, promises to lift us
out of our difficulties, repair our
misfortunes, and make up in the
most tender manner for our sorrows
and troubles. And in this there is
no attempt at explanation; it doe

not attempt to explain what is
called the problem of evil, it only
saves us from our evil.
Now it is a mistake that before
we become spiritually minded we
must settle a hundred questions
about our origin; for these things
are not next to us, and in whatever
way they may be settled they will
not change our real quality. We
may wonder how (iod caused such
as this, but he has made it, and
you and 1 are here, facts which no
acquisition of knowledge can
change. What we want is to bring
our hearts and our consciousness
and our imaginations into sym
pathy with the will of (iod, and to
learn to understand him as we un
derstand each other, not with our
heads but with our hearts. Ue
ligion is a personal relation, ac
quired through the personal affec
tions, the conscience, and the im
agination.
The supreme importance of re
ligion to us as individuals iies in
its influence upon character of one
who is constantly undergoing the
trials and temptations of evil. The
temper in which we bear the griefs
and the pains and the disappoint
ments of life modifies all our ex
periences, tinges the whole land
scape of life; and this attitude of
the mind is more strongly influ
enced by religion than by any
or every thing else; it transforms
the world without by the power of
a divine character within. lie
ligioii thus becomes the supreme
guide of life, and solves the prob
lem of life by living. It supplies
the supreme motive to all liberal
studies, and thus puts the mind in
communion with all truth.
And now let me invoke every
blessing on you all —the head of
the faculty, the teachers, and the
pupilage, on ibis University in its
opening and renewed career, and
upon you by whom its halls have
been gladdened.
