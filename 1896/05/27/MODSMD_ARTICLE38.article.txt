# The
						Baccalaureate Sermon.
## 
### 
On Sunday morning tin* chapel
was crowded to its utmost capacity
liy admirers of Rev. Horatio Steb-
Jmiis, who delivered the baccalaure
ate sermon, in substance as follows:
"Because he has set his love
upon me, therefore will I deliver
him. I will set, him on high, he
cause he has known niv power, lie
shall call upon me and I will an
swer him. 1 will he with him in
trouble. I will deliver him and
honor him. With long life will I
satisfy him, and show him my sal
vation."
lo the intellect alone religion
makes an evil, even conceited as
sumption; yet it proves to he man's
greatest reward, assuages his
troubles, calms the deepest disturb
ances of his beingâ€”and this with
out a word of explanation or apol
ogy. It offers no proofs and af
firms there can he no proof but the
consent of the heart domesticated
in the temple which encloses it.
The reason of it is the child's
reason. "It is so because it is so."
lint to the able, inquiring intellect
this violates reason, is no reason,
but simply a mist that has formed
over all our great primal belief,
which says, "Trust and live." Hut
the profouiulest answer to the pro
foundest things is forever t he child's
answer, ' It is so because it is so,"
and the wisdom of life is in tinding
out that this answer is profound
and true.
Now religion, with no dogmatic
seat of knowledge or exclusive
truth, but with a general dignity of
self-possession, is the sense of safetv
in (iod safety from the storm and
peril of evil. What explanation do
we need for this? People all know
that evil is a fact, that the world is
full of trouble, that every jov has a
corresponding pain The silent
seas whisper not a word of pity for
the empty ships and all the wealth
of precious life and love that sleeps
in its sunless caverns; pestilence
and famine flv like destroying an
gels from city to city, from conti
nent to continent. Hut all this
seems too vast for us to he brought
into personal relationship with it.
Look into the life of despondent in
dividuals and behold t lie bitterness
and the amount of physical suffer
ing and exquisite grief. The ex
perience of all mankind, of all gen
erations of the world, will not
reveal it to an individual heart.
