The concert of the Stanford
Choral Society on Thursday even
ing the '21 st under the direction of
Mr. 11. li. Basniore of San Fran
cisco was a revelation to many who
apparently have no conception of
what may be accomplished by an
intelligent, earnest body of singers
under able leadership. l'erhans
the mental discipline of a univer
sity course of study and its result
ant habit of concentration of
thought may have contributed lo
the success of the evening's work.
Much surprise was expressed at the
excellent results obtained from only
three mouths' practice and training.
The singers were most decidedly
in earnest and determined to do
full justice to their program, their
leader, and their society. They
presented a very fine appearance
in their artistic grouping, the white
gowns of the ladies with their
bright touches of Stanford cardinal
adding greatly to the charming en
semble.
It is greatly to be regretted that
the stage afforded insufficient room
for the comfortable accommodation
of a large chorus with the necessary
space fora grand piano and suit
able distance between the con
ductor and singers.
The program was an ambitious
one, hill it served to demonstrate
the fact thai concentration and de
termination in leader and singers
can work wonders. The selection
of the members exhibited the pur
pose of the leader to work on broad
lines and to "aim high." ()ne of
the most striking points of theeven
ing's work was the unexpected in
tensify of power shown in the
"Heavens Are Tellinu" and the

" Hallelujah Chorus." In direct
contrast to this were the lighter,
more delicate effects so well
brought out in those beautiful com
positions, .Mendelssohn's " Fare
well to the Forest" and"He,
Watching over Israel." This lat
ter number was rendered in a man
ner well worthy a more experienced
chorus, and was considered by
many to be the gem of the choral
work.
Indeed, the rendition of the
whole program evinced a thorough
appreciation of the great value of
tone-quality and tone-color in the
production of fine choral effects.
Those same delicate factors, if
rightly understood and skillfully
managed, will atone for many de
ficiencies in individual voices, will
compensate for lack of numbers,
and will assist in producing tone
effects not possible even to greater
experience with less understanding.
That the more generally known
effectiveness of light and shade,
contrast of piano and forte, is also
well understood by the Choral
Society was evident in its rendition
of Costa's "Damascus March" and
Schubert s "Forth to the Meadows."
The society is to be congratulated
on the possession of solo voices so
line as those of the Misses M. 1\
Little and Alice Uoveland and
Messrs. Douglas 11. Campbell and
(illy 11. Cochran. Miss (irilliu's
thoroughly musical temperament
and training were again displayed
in her solo numbers, a "Prelude''
by Bait' and a "Minuet" by Mos
eowski. She also contributed
largely to the success of the famous
"Kreutzer Sonata" of Beethoven,
brilliantly rendered by Mr. Sig
niund Heel and herself.
Mr. Beel played Weiniawki's
Russian air with with his custom
ary wondrous execution and was
most enthusiastically received and
encored.
Much praise is due to Frederick
Mauer for his excellent work as ac
companist .
The audience was a notably at
tentive one. The entire manage
ment of the concert reflects great
credit on the executive committee.
The Stanford Choral Society has
reason to be proud of its initial
performance before the public, as
well as of its marked progress, both
material and musical. It possesses
the proud distinction of being the
only self-supporting society of its
kind in existence, the choruses in
other colleges being supported by
tlie funds of the institution to
which they belong. Besides being
self-supporting, it lias purchased a
large and well-selected musical
library and is buying a concert
grand piano for the University.
Several of the professors have
been active and interested attend
ants at all rehearsals, besides lend
ing their influence to promote its
interests otherwise. This speaks
most encouragingly for the future
welfare of the society, and for the
cause of musical art in the Univer
sity.
