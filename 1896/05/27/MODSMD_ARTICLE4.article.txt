# "An Intercollegiate Affair."
## 
### 
The senior farce was presented
on Monday morning in Encina
gymnasium. The farce was the
work of W. 11. Irwin, who has
already made quite a name for
himself as a litterateur of promis
ing ability.
The introduction of "Old .John"
on the stage was a great hit and
proved that John would have been
a great actor had his histrionic
ability been cultivated.
