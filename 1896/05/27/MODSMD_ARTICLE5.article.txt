# The 						Higher Sacrifice.

David Starr .Jordan addressed
the graduates as follows:
Slavery and freedom are together
in every human life. This goes
with the definition of life itself.
Each creature that lives must bend
its back to the lash of its environ
ment. We dream of life without
conditions, life free from the pres
sure of insensate things, without us
or within. lint such life is the
dream of philosophers. We have
never known it. The records of the
life we know are full of concessions
t<» such pressure. Each man is a
slave because he is a living being.
The vegetative part of life, that
part which finds its expression in
physical growth and sustenance
and death, must always be slavery.
The old primal hunger of the pro
toplasm rules it all. Each of the
myriad cells of which man is made
must be fed and cared for. The
perennial hunger of these cells he
must stifie. This hunger began
when life began. It will cease only
when life ceases. It will last till
the water of the sea is drained, the
great lights are put out, and the
empty and useless earth is hung up
in the archives of the universe with
the worlds that have been and are
no longer.
This old hunger the individual
man must each day meet and sat
isfy. lie must do ibis for himself,
else in the long run it will not be
done. If others help feed him, he
must feed others in return. This
return is not charity nor sacrifice:
ii is simply exchange of work. It
is the division of labor in servitude.
Directly or indirectly each must,
pay his debt of life. There are a
few, as the world goes, who in lux
ury or in pauperism have this debt
paid for them by others. But
there are not many of these fugitive
slaves. The number will never be
great, for the lineage of idleness is
never long or strong.
When tins debt is paid, the slave
becomes the man. Nature counts
as men only those who are free.
Freedom springs from within. No
outside power can give it. Hoard
and lodging on the earth once paid,
a man's resources are his own.
These he can give or hold. By the
fullness of these he is measured.
''As is the receipt," Emerson
tell us, "so is the gift." Ali acqui
sitions of man "are victories of the
good brain and brave heart: the
world belongs to the energetic, be
longs to the wise, it is in vain to
make a paradise but for good men."
In the ancient lore of the .lews,
so liabhi Voorsanger tells us. it is
written: "Serve the Lord, not as
slaves, hoping for reward, but as
gods who will take no reward." The
meaning of the old saying i> t his:
"Only the gods can serve."
Those wlio gain nothing, have
nothing to give, lie who lives as
a slave only serves himself. That
he hopes for reward shows that to
himself his service is really given.
To serve the Lord, according to Mn
ether old saying, is to help one's
fellow men. The Eternal asks not
of in<irtals thal they assist Him
with llis earlli. The tough old
world has been llis for centuries of
centuries. It came to be ours, and
we can neither make it nor mar it.
We were not consulted when its
foundations were laid in the deep.
The waves and the storm, the sun
shine and the song of birds need
not our aid. They will take care of
themselves. Life is the only ma
terial that is plastic to our hand.
Only man can be helped by man.
"As thou lovest me," Christ said to
Simon Peter, "as thou lovest me.
feed my lambs.*'
W hen they hung John Brown in

Virginia, many said, you remem
ber, that he had thrown away his
life and would gain nothing for it.
"He could not," as Thoreau said at
the time, "get a vote of thanks or a
pair of boots for his life. He could
not get four and-sixpence a day for
I being hung, take the year round."
1 But he was not asking fora vote of
thanks. It was not for the four
and-sixpence that he stood between
brute force and its victims. It was
to show men the nature of slavery.
It was to help his fellow citizens to
| read the story of their institutions
in the light of history. ''You can
get more fora quart of milk," Tho
reau went on to say, "in the market
at Concord than you can fora
quart of blood: but yours i> not the
market heroes carry their blood to."
The blood of heroes is not sold by
the quart. The great, strong, noble,
and pure of the world, those who
have made our race worthy to be
called men, have not been paid by
the day or by the quart, not by
riches nor fame nor power, nor any
thing that man can give. Out of
1 the fullness of their lives have they
i served the Lord. Out of their re
journs have they helped their ft' I -
I low men.
Only those who thus rise above
all matters of rank and fame and
j wages can live in the records of
| man. The great man can not be a
J self-seeker. The greatness of a Na
poleon or an Alexander is the
; greatness of gluttony. It is slavery
on a grand scale. What men have
done for their own glory or aggran
dizement has left no penna nent im
press. "1 have carried out noth
ing"' says the warrior, Sigurd
Slenibe; "I have not sown the least
grain nor laid one stone upon an
other to witness that I have lived."
jA Napoleon could have said as
much, if like Sigurd he could have
stood "upon his own grave and
heard the great bell ring."
What such men have torn down
remains torn down. It would
shortly have fa lien of itself, for that
which is destined to live can never
be torn down by force.
But what such men have built
has fallen when their hands have
ceased to hold it up. The names
history cherishes are men of an
(other type. Only "a man too sim
ply great to scheme for his proper
sell"' is great enough to become a
pi 11 a r of t he ages.
It is part of the duty of higher
education to build up ideals of no
ble freedom. It is not for help in
the vegetative work of life that one
goes to college. lie is just as good
a si a ve without it. He can earn
iiis board and lodging without the
formality of culture. The training
of the college will make his power
for action greater, no doubt, but it
will also magnify bis needs. The
debt of life a scholar lias to pay is
greater than that paid by theelown.
And the higher sacrifice the scholar
may be called upon to make grows
with the increased fullness of his
life, (ireater needs go with greater
power, and both mean greater op
port unities for sacrifice.
In the days you have been with
us, you should have formed some
ideals, you should have bound
these ideals together with thechain
of well spent yesterdays, which is
the first necessity toward making
tlieni real. You should have done
something in the direction of the
life of higher sacrifice, the life that
from the fullnessof its resources can
ha ve soniet liing to give.
The men you meet as you leave
these halls will not understand
these ideals. They will not know
that your life is not bound
up in the present, but has some
thing to ask or to give for the

future. Till they understand you,
tlley will not give you their svmpa
thies. They may jeer at you because
the whip they respond to leaves no
mark upon you. They will trv to
huv you, because the Devil has
always bid high for the lives of
young men with ideals. A man in
his market stands always above
par. Slaves are bis stock in trade.
If a man with power can be had for
base purposes, he can be sure of an
immediate reward. You can sell
your blood for its weight in milk or
for its weight in gold, whichever
you choose —if you are willing to
put it up for sale. You can sell
your will for the kingdoms of the
earth; and you will see or seem to
see many of your associates mak
ing just such bargains. Hut in
this be not deceived. No voting
man worthy of anything else ever
sold himself to the Devil. These
are dummy sales. The Devil puts
his own up at auction in hopes of
catching others. If you fell into
his hands, you had not far to fall.
You were already ripe for his
clutches, " let I bee behind me," is
a command Satan can never choose
but obey.
When a man steps forth from
the college he is tested once for all.
It takes bill a year or two lo prove
his mettle. In the college high
ideals prevail and the intellectual
life is taken as a matter of course.
In the world outside it appears
otherwise, though the conditions of
life are in fact just the same. It is
not true, though it .?eenis so, that
the common life is made up of
"grasping and griping with a u bine
for mercy at the end of it." It is
your own fault if you find it so.
It is not true that the thought of
man is occupied with the effort 'Mo
live just asking but to live." The
world of thought and the world of
action are one in essence. In both
truth is strength, and folly and
selfishness are weakness. There is
no confusion of right and wrong in
the mind of the fates. It is only
in our poor bewildered slave intel
lects that evil passes for power.
All about us in the press of life are
real men. .Men who can not be
bought nor sold, the men in whose
guidance the current of history
Hows.
'The lesson of value in life it
should be yours to teach, because
it should lie yours to know. Men
are better than they seem, and the
hidden virtues of life appear when
men have learned how to translate
them. Men grasp and hoard
material tilings because in their
poverty of soul they know of noth
ing else to do. It is lack of train
ing and lack of imagination rather
than total depravity which gives
our social life its sordid aspect.
When a plant has learned the
secret of flowers and fruit, it no
longer goes on adding meaningless
leaf to leaf. And as "flowers are
only colored leaves, fruit only ripe
ones. ' so are the virtues only per
fected and ripened forms of those
impulses which show themselves as
vices.
It is your relation to the over
flow of power that determines the
manner of man you are. Slave or
god, it is for you to choose. Slave
or god. it is for you to will. It is
for such choice that will is given.
Sav what we may about the limita
tions of th«* life of man, tliev are
largely self limitations. Hemmed
in is human life by the force of the
fates; but the will of man is one of
the fates, and can take it- place by
the side of the rest of them. I he
man who can will is a factor in the
universe. Only the who can will
can serve t he Lord at all, and by I he
same token, hoping for no reward.

Ina recent magazine, the Pinl,
Mr. \Y. P. Ueeves tells us a tale,
half humorous, liulf allegorical, of
the decadence of a scholar. Ac
cording to this story, one Thomson
was a college graduate, full of high
notions of the significance of life
and the duties and privileges of the
scholar. W illi these ideals he went
to (iermany, that he might
strengthen them and use them for
the benefit of his fellowmen. lie
spent some years in (iermany till
ing his mind with all that (ier
iii,'in philosophy could give. Then
he came home to turn his philoso
phy into action. To do this he
sought a college professorship.
This lie found it was not easy to
secure. Nobody cared for him or
his message. The authority of
I "'wise and sober (iermany" was not
recognized in the institutions of
America, and he found that col
lege professorships were no longer
"plums to be picked" by whomso
ever should ask for them. The
! reverence the (iernian professor
commands was unknown in Amer
ica.in (iermany, the authority of
wise men is supreme. Their words,
j when tiicy speak, are heard with
reverence and attention. In Amer
ica wisdom is not wisdom till tie
I common man has examined it and
pronounced it to be such. Ihe
conclusions of the scholar are re
vised by the daily newspaper. The
readers of these papers care little
for messages from I topia. Ihe
theories of the philosopher do not
concern them. No college opened
its door to Thomson, and he saw
.with dismay that the li'e before
him was one of discomfort and
insignificance, his ideals having no
exchangeable value in luxuries or
comforts. Meanwhile Thomson's
early associates seemed to get on
somehow. The world wanted their
cheap achievements, though it did
not care for him.
One of these was one Wilcox,
i and though small in abilities and
poor in virtues, bis infiiience seemed
to be unbounded. The young
woman who had felt an interest
in Thomson's development aml to
whom he had read his rejected ver
ses and his uncalled for philosophy,
had joined herself to the Philistines
and yielded to their influence. She
had become \\ ilcox s wife. II is
friends regarded I honison s failure
as a joke. lle must not take liini
; self too seriously. A man rdiouhl
be in touch with his times. "Kven
Philistia," one said, ''has its tes
t hetic rit ua I and pageant ry." A
wise man man will not despise this
ritual, because Philistinism after
all is the life of the world.
Hut Thomson held out. "I
pledged my word in (iermany," he
said, "to teach nothing that I did
not believe to he true. 1 must live
up to this pledge." And so he
sought for positions and failed to
find them. Finally lie had a mes
sage from a friend that a professor
ship was vacant in a certain insti
tution. This message said: "culti
vate Wilcox.'' So in despair Thom
son began to "Cultivate Wilcox."
lie began to feel that Wilcox was a 1
type of the world, a bad world for
which he was not responsible. The)
world's servant he must be if
he received its wages. When he I
secured the appointment through
the political pull of Wilcox and
the mild kindness of Mrs. Wilcox
he was ready to teach whatever
was wanted of him, whether it w;isl
truth in (iermany or not. lie;
found that he could change his
notions of truth. The W ilcox idea
was that everything in America is
all right just as it. is, and to this he
found it easy to respond. Ilis|
salary helped him to do so. And i
at last, the record says, lie became!
"laudator temporis aetai", one who
praises the times that are past. As i
such betook little part in the t ini |
that are to be.
So runs the allegory. How shall
it be with you? There are many
Thomsons among our scholars.!
There may be some among you.
W hen you pass from the world of
thought you will find yourself in a
world ot action. The conditions!
are not changed, but they may!
seem changed. How shall you re
spond to the seeming difference?!
Is the truth of high thinking to he |
given up for the appearance of I
speedy success?
1 112 you do t his it will be not t hal
you are worldly wise, but because;
you do not know the world. In!
your ignorance of men you will
sell yourself cheaply.
One must know life before he
can know truth. lie who would
be a leader of men must first have
the power to lead himself. The
world is selfish and unsympathetic.
Hut it is also sagacious. It rejects
as worthless him who suffers de
cadence when he conies in contact
with its vulgar cleverness. The
true man will teach truth wherever
he is, not because he has pledged
himself in (iermany not to teach
anything else, but because in teach
ing truth he is teaching himself,
llis life thus becomes a natural
life and to a natural life sooner or
later the world will respond. The
natural man can look the world
full in the face. The world knows
the value of genuineness, and it
yields to that force wherever it is
felt. "The world is all gates" says
Finer son, "all opportunities, strings
of tension waiting to be struck, the
Farthas sensitive as c.odine to
light, the most plastic and impres
sionable medium alive to every
touch."
Thus in the decadence of Thom
son it was not the times or the
world or America that was at fault;
it was Thompson himself. lit; had
in him no life of his own. His
knowledge like his microscope was
"made in (iermany,and bore not
his mark'but the mark of the (Jer
man factory. Truth was not made
in (iermany, and to know or to
teach truth there must be a life be
hind it.
The decadence of Thomson was
the appearance of the real Thom
son from under the axioms and
formula' his teachers had given
him. It was fortunate for Amer
ica that the real Thomson came to

the surface so soon, before any
thing important wan given him to i
spoil.
Men do not fail because they are
human. They are not human j
enough. Failure comes from lack i
of life. Only the man who has
forced convictions of his own and
who knows how convictions are
formed can ha ve the courage of his
convictions. Only such men can
teach the truth. Thomson had no
convictions. He had learned the
words of authority. Learning!
alone does not make a man strong.
Strength in life will show itself in
helpfulness, will show itself in sym
pathy, in sacrifice. "(ireat men"
says Kmerson, "feel that they are
so by renouncing their selfishness l
and falling back on what is human.
'They beat with the pulse and
breathe with the lungs of nations." i
It is not enough to know truth,
one must know men. It is not j
enough to know men, one must be
a man. Only he who can live truth
can know it. Only he who can live !
truth can teach it. "Ilecould talk
men over," says Carlyle of Mira
beau, "he could talk men over be-!
cause he could act men over. At
bottom that was it."
And this at bottom is the source
of all power and service. Not what!
a man knows or what he can say, j
but what is he? what can he do? j
Not what can he do for bis board
and lodging, as the slave who is
"hired for life"; but what can lie |
do out of the fullness of his resour
ces, the fullness of his helpfulness,
the fullness of himself. The work 1
the world will not let die was never
paid for —not in fame, not in money. \
not in power.
The decadence of literature, <>i j
which much is said today, is not '
due to the decadence of man. It is
not the effect of the nerve strain of
overwrought generations born too
late in the dusk of the ages. Its
nature is this, that uncritical and
untrained men have come into a
heritage they have not earned.
'They will pay money to have their
feeble fancy tickled. The decad
ence of literature is the struggle of
mountebanks to catch the public
eye. There is money in the litera
ture of decay, and those who work
for money have "verily their re
ward." Hut these performances
are not the work of men. They
have no relation to literature or art
or human life. 'These are not in
decadence because imitations are
sold on street corners or tossed into
our laps on railway trains. As
well say that gold is in its decad
ence because brass can be burnished
to look like it. Or that the sun is
in bis dotage because we have tilled
ourdooryard with Chinese lanterns.
Literature has never been paid
t for. Il has never asked the gold or
the plaudits of the multitude.
Job and Hamlet and Faust and
Lear were never created to till the
! pages of a Sunday newspaper. John
j Milton and John Huiivan were not
publishers' hacks, nor were John
! Hampden. John Hright, or Samuel
j Adams under pay as walking dele-
I gates of reform.
No man was hired to lind oul
that the world was round, or that
valleys were worn by water, or that
; the stars were suns. No man was
; paid to burn at the stake, or to die,
I that other men might be free to live.
The sane, strong, heroic of all
I ages, the men who were men in the
natural order of th ugs have lived
j above all considerations of pay or
glory. They have served the Lord,
not as slaves hoping for rewards,
1 >ut as gods who would take no re
wards. Men could not reward
Shakspere or Darwin or Newton
or 1 lelmholtz for their services any
more than they could pay the Lord
for the use of his sunshine. And
from the same inexhaustible divine
reservoir it all comes—the sacrifice
of meat men and the sunshine of
God.
"Thrice have 1 molded my image,
Ami thrice stretched forth my
hand:
Made one of day and one of night,
And one of the salt sea strand:
< >ne in a Judean manger,
And one by Avon's stream,
One over against the mouths of
the Nile,
And one in the Academe."
And in such image men are made
every day, not only in Judea or in
Stratford, not on the banks of the
Nile or the Arno, but on the banks
of the Columbia or the Sacramento,
it may be as well.
All over the earth, in this image,
are the sane and the sound and the
true. And when and where their
lives are spent arise generations of
others like tlieni: men in the true
order. Not alone men in the "im
age of God" but gods in the like
ness of nen.
It is to the training of the nat
ural man that the universities of
the world are devoted. They call
for the higher sacrifice, the sacrifice
of those who have powers not
needed in the common struggle of
life, and who have therefore some
thing over ami beyond this struggle
t<> give for their fellows. Large or
small, whatever their gift may lie,
the world needs it all, and to every
good gift the world shall respond a
thousand fold. For strength begets
strength and wisdom leads to wis
dom. " There is always room for
the man of force, and he makes
room for many. ' It is the strong,
the wise, the good of the past who
have made our lives possible. It is
these great human men, the men
"in the natural order," that have
made it possible for the plain com
mon men like you and me to live
rather than merely to vegetate.
We hear men among us some
times who complain of the
shortness of life, the sinallness of
truth, the limited stage on which
men are forced to act. Hut the
men who thus complain are not the
men vvlio have filled this little stage
with their action. 'The man who
has learned to serve the Lord never
complains that his master has not
given him enough to do. The man
who helps his fellow men does not
stand about with idle hands to find
men worthy his assistance. lie
who leads a worthy life never
vexes himself with the question as
to whether life is worth living. For
we know that all our powers are
products of the needs and duties of
our ancestors. Wisdom too great
to be translated into action is an
absurdity; for wisdom is only know
ing what it is best to do next; vir
tue is only doing it. To know and
to do is the essence of the highest
service. Those the world has a
right to honor are those who found
enough in the world to do. The
fields are always white to the har
vest, and the most each of them
can accomplish is to show the hosts
that follow how to make service ef
fective.
Alexander the Great had con
quered his neighbors in Greece and
Asia Minor, the only world he
knew. Then he sighed for more
worlds to conquer. Hut other
worlds he knew nothing of lay all
about him. The secrets of the
rocks be bad never suspected.
Steam, electricity, the growth of
trees, the fall of snow, ali these

were mysteries to him. The only
conquest he knew, the subjugation
iof men's bodies, went but a little
way. All the men who, in his life
time, knew the name of Alexander
the Great could find encampment
on the Palo Alto farm. The great
world of men in his day was be
yond his knowledge. His world
was a very small one, and of this
he had seen but a little corner.
The prowess of the cock victorious
on his own dunghill was of the
[ same nature as the glory of Alex
ander.
For the need of more worlds to
conquer is no badge of strength.
It is the stamp of ignorance. It is
the cry only of him who knows not
that the great earth about him still
stands unconquered.
No Lincoln ever wept that he
had not more nations to save; no
Luther that he had not more
churches to purify; no Darwin that
nature had not more hidden secrets
which he might follow to their
depths; no Agassiz that the
thoughts of God were all exhausted
before he was born.
And now a word to you as
scholars. The higher education
means the higher sacrifice. That
you are taught to know is simply
that you may do. That you know the
truth signifies only that you should
do the right. That you should
know and do has value only as
translated into justice and love.
Justice and love are not for your
selves. Their relations are with
others. There is no man so strong
as not to need your help. There is
no man so weak that you can not
make him stronger. There is no
man so sick that you can not bring
I liini to the "gate called 'beauti
ful.' " There is no evil in this
world that you can not help turn
into goodness.
"We could lift up this land,"
said Björnson of Norway, "if we
lifted as one." Therefore lift, and
lift as one. You are strong enough
and wise enough. You shall seek
strength and wisdom, that others
through you may be wiser and
stronger. You shall seek your
place to work, as your basis for
helpfulness. Others will make the
place as good as you deserve.
Wherever you go you shall be
teachers of men. Whether it be an
honored chair in a university, such
which wise men sometimes hold in
our day, or whether it be a rack or
cross, as other teachers than yours
have known in days that are past,
he remains a teacher. If his life
is sacrificed in helping men, it is to
the market of the ages he carries
his blood, and not to the milk mar
ket of Concord town. He will not
"pledge himself in Germany to
teach nothing which is not true."
Being true himself he can teach
nothing false. The more men of
the true order there are in the
world, the greater is the world's
need for men. When all are men,
slavery shall be no more.
As you are men, so will your
places in life be secure. Every
profession is calling for you. Ev
ery walk of life is waiting for your
effort. There will always be room
for you, and you will each of you
make room for many.
David Starr .Jordan addressed
the graduates as follows:
Slavery and freedom are together
in every human life. This goes
with the definition of life itself.
Each creature that lives must bend
its back to the lash of its environ
ment. We dream of life without
conditions, life free from the pres
sure of insensate things, without us
or within. lint such life is the
dream of philosophers. We have
never known it. The records of the
life we know are full of concessions
t<» such pressure. Each man is a
slave because he is a living being.
The vegetative part of life, that
part which finds its expression in
physical growth and sustenance
and death, must always be slavery.
The old primal hunger of the pro
toplasm rules it all. Each of the
myriad cells of which man is made
must be fed and cared for. The
perennial hunger of these cells he
must stifie. This hunger began
when life began. It will cease only
when life ceases. It will last till
the water of the sea is drained, the
great lights are put out, and the
empty and useless earth is hung up
in the archives of the universe with
the worlds that have been and are
no longer.
This old hunger the individual
man must each day meet and sat
isfy. lie must do ibis for himself,
else in the long run it will not be
done. If others help feed him, he
must feed others in return. This
return is not charity nor sacrifice:
ii is simply exchange of work. It
is the division of labor in servitude.
Directly or indirectly each must,
pay his debt of life. There are a
few, as the world goes, who in lux
ury or in pauperism have this debt
paid for them by others. But
there are not many of these fugitive
slaves. The number will never be
great, for the lineage of idleness is
never long or strong.
When tins debt is paid, the slave
becomes the man. Nature counts
as men only those who are free.
Freedom springs from within. No
outside power can give it. Hoard
and lodging on the earth once paid,
a man's resources are his own.
These he can give or hold. By the
fullness of these he is measured.
''As is the receipt," Emerson
tell us, "so is the gift." Ali acqui
sitions of man "are victories of the
good brain and brave heart: the
world belongs to the energetic, be
longs to the wise, it is in vain to
make a paradise but for good men."
In the ancient lore of the .lews,
so liabhi Voorsanger tells us. it is
written: "Serve the Lord, not as
slaves, hoping for reward, but as
gods who will take no reward." The
meaning of the old saying i> t his:
"Only the gods can serve."
Those wlio gain nothing, have
nothing to give, lie who lives as
a slave only serves himself. That
he hopes for reward shows that to
himself his service is really given.
To serve the Lord, according to Mn
ether old saying, is to help one's
fellow men. The Eternal asks not
of in<irtals thal they assist Him
with llis earlli. The tough old
world has been llis for centuries of
centuries. It came to be ours, and
we can neither make it nor mar it.
We were not consulted when its
foundations were laid in the deep.
The waves and the storm, the sun
shine and the song of birds need
not our aid. They will take care of
themselves. Life is the only ma
terial that is plastic to our hand.
Only man can be helped by man.
"As thou lovest me," Christ said to
Simon Peter, "as thou lovest me.
feed my lambs.*'
W hen they hung John Brown in

Virginia, many said, you remem
ber, that he had thrown away his
life and would gain nothing for it.
"He could not," as Thoreau said at
the time, "get a vote of thanks or a
pair of boots for his life. He could
not get four and-sixpence a day for
I being hung, take the year round."
1 But he was not asking fora vote of
thanks. It was not for the four
and-sixpence that he stood between
brute force and its victims. It was
to show men the nature of slavery.
It was to help his fellow citizens to
| read the story of their institutions
in the light of history. ''You can
get more fora quart of milk," Tho
reau went on to say, "in the market
at Concord than you can fora
quart of blood: but yours i> not the
market heroes carry their blood to."
The blood of heroes is not sold by
the quart. The great, strong, noble,
and pure of the world, those who
have made our race worthy to be
called men, have not been paid by
the day or by the quart, not by
riches nor fame nor power, nor any
thing that man can give. Out of
1 the fullness of their lives have they
i served the Lord. Out of their re
journs have they helped their ft' I -
I low men.
Only those who thus rise above
all matters of rank and fame and
j wages can live in the records of
| man. The great man can not be a
J self-seeker. The greatness of a Na
poleon or an Alexander is the
; greatness of gluttony. It is slavery
on a grand scale. What men have
done for their own glory or aggran
dizement has left no penna nent im
press. "1 have carried out noth
ing"' says the warrior, Sigurd
Slenibe; "I have not sown the least
grain nor laid one stone upon an
other to witness that I have lived."
jA Napoleon could have said as
much, if like Sigurd he could have
stood "upon his own grave and
heard the great bell ring."
What such men have torn down
remains torn down. It would
shortly have fa lien of itself, for that
which is destined to live can never
be torn down by force.
But what such men have built
has fallen when their hands have
ceased to hold it up. The names
history cherishes are men of an
(other type. Only "a man too sim
ply great to scheme for his proper
sell"' is great enough to become a
pi 11 a r of t he ages.
It is part of the duty of higher
education to build up ideals of no
ble freedom. It is not for help in
the vegetative work of life that one
goes to college. lie is just as good
a si a ve without it. He can earn
iiis board and lodging without the
formality of culture. The training
of the college will make his power
for action greater, no doubt, but it
will also magnify bis needs. The
debt of life a scholar lias to pay is
greater than that paid by theelown.
And the higher sacrifice the scholar
may be called upon to make grows
with the increased fullness of his
life, (ireater needs go with greater
power, and both mean greater op
port unities for sacrifice.
In the days you have been with
us, you should have formed some
ideals, you should have bound
these ideals together with thechain
of well spent yesterdays, which is
the first necessity toward making
tlieni real. You should have done
something in the direction of the
life of higher sacrifice, the life that
from the fullnessof its resources can
ha ve soniet liing to give.
The men you meet as you leave
these halls will not understand
these ideals. They will not know
that your life is not bound
up in the present, but has some
thing to ask or to give for the

future. Till they understand you,
tlley will not give you their svmpa
thies. They may jeer at you because
the whip they respond to leaves no
mark upon you. They will trv to
huv you, because the Devil has
always bid high for the lives of
young men with ideals. A man in
his market stands always above
par. Slaves are bis stock in trade.
If a man with power can be had for
base purposes, he can be sure of an
immediate reward. You can sell
your blood for its weight in milk or
for its weight in gold, whichever
you choose —if you are willing to
put it up for sale. You can sell
your will for the kingdoms of the
earth; and you will see or seem to
see many of your associates mak
ing just such bargains. Hut in
this be not deceived. No voting
man worthy of anything else ever
sold himself to the Devil. These
are dummy sales. The Devil puts
his own up at auction in hopes of
catching others. If you fell into
his hands, you had not far to fall.
You were already ripe for his
clutches, " let I bee behind me," is
a command Satan can never choose
but obey.
When a man steps forth from
the college he is tested once for all.
It takes bill a year or two lo prove
his mettle. In the college high
ideals prevail and the intellectual
life is taken as a matter of course.
In the world outside it appears
otherwise, though the conditions of
life are in fact just the same. It is
not true, though it .?eenis so, that
the common life is made up of
"grasping and griping with a u bine
for mercy at the end of it." It is
your own fault if you find it so.
It is not true that the thought of
man is occupied with the effort 'Mo
live just asking but to live." The
world of thought and the world of
action are one in essence. In both
truth is strength, and folly and
selfishness are weakness. There is
no confusion of right and wrong in
the mind of the fates. It is only
in our poor bewildered slave intel
lects that evil passes for power.
All about us in the press of life are
real men. .Men who can not be
bought nor sold, the men in whose
guidance the current of history
Hows.
'The lesson of value in life it
should be yours to teach, because
it should lie yours to know. Men
are better than they seem, and the
hidden virtues of life appear when
men have learned how to translate
them. Men grasp and hoard
material tilings because in their
poverty of soul they know of noth
ing else to do. It is lack of train
ing and lack of imagination rather
than total depravity which gives
our social life its sordid aspect.
When a plant has learned the
secret of flowers and fruit, it no
longer goes on adding meaningless
leaf to leaf. And as "flowers are
only colored leaves, fruit only ripe
ones. ' so are the virtues only per
fected and ripened forms of those
impulses which show themselves as
vices.
It is your relation to the over
flow of power that determines the
manner of man you are. Slave or
god, it is for you to choose. Slave
or god. it is for you to will. It is
for such choice that will is given.
Sav what we may about the limita
tions of th«* life of man, tliev are
largely self limitations. Hemmed
in is human life by the force of the
fates; but the will of man is one of
the fates, and can take it- place by
the side of the rest of them. I he
man who can will is a factor in the
universe. Only the who can will
can serve t he Lord at all, and by I he
same token, hoping for no reward.

Ina recent magazine, the Pinl,
Mr. \Y. P. Ueeves tells us a tale,
half humorous, liulf allegorical, of
the decadence of a scholar. Ac
cording to this story, one Thomson
was a college graduate, full of high
notions of the significance of life
and the duties and privileges of the
scholar. W illi these ideals he went
to (iermany, that he might
strengthen them and use them for
the benefit of his fellowmen. lie
spent some years in (iermany till
ing his mind with all that (ier
iii,'in philosophy could give. Then
he came home to turn his philoso
phy into action. To do this he
sought a college professorship.
This lie found it was not easy to
secure. Nobody cared for him or
his message. The authority of
I "'wise and sober (iermany" was not
recognized in the institutions of
America, and he found that col
lege professorships were no longer
"plums to be picked" by whomso
ever should ask for them. The
! reverence the (iernian professor
commands was unknown in Amer
ica.in (iermany, the authority of
wise men is supreme. Their words,
j when tiicy speak, are heard with
reverence and attention. In Amer
ica wisdom is not wisdom till tie
I common man has examined it and
pronounced it to be such. Ihe
conclusions of the scholar are re
vised by the daily newspaper. The
readers of these papers care little
for messages from I topia. Ihe
theories of the philosopher do not
concern them. No college opened
its door to Thomson, and he saw
.with dismay that the li'e before
him was one of discomfort and
insignificance, his ideals having no
exchangeable value in luxuries or
comforts. Meanwhile Thomson's
early associates seemed to get on
somehow. The world wanted their
cheap achievements, though it did
not care for him.
One of these was one Wilcox,
i and though small in abilities and
poor in virtues, bis infiiience seemed
to be unbounded. The young
woman who had felt an interest
in Thomson's development aml to
whom he had read his rejected ver
ses and his uncalled for philosophy,
had joined herself to the Philistines
and yielded to their influence. She
had become \\ ilcox s wife. II is
friends regarded I honison s failure
as a joke. lle must not take liini
; self too seriously. A man rdiouhl
be in touch with his times. "Kven
Philistia," one said, ''has its tes
t hetic rit ua I and pageant ry." A
wise man man will not despise this
ritual, because Philistinism after
all is the life of the world.
Hut Thomson held out. "I
pledged my word in (iermany," he
said, "to teach nothing that I did
not believe to he true. 1 must live
up to this pledge." And so he
sought for positions and failed to
find them. Finally lie had a mes
sage from a friend that a professor
ship was vacant in a certain insti
tution. This message said: "culti
vate Wilcox.'' So in despair Thom
son began to "Cultivate Wilcox."
lie began to feel that Wilcox was a 1
type of the world, a bad world for
which he was not responsible. The)
world's servant he must be if
he received its wages. When he I
secured the appointment through
the political pull of Wilcox and
the mild kindness of Mrs. Wilcox
he was ready to teach whatever
was wanted of him, whether it w;isl
truth in (iermany or not. lie;
found that he could change his
notions of truth. The W ilcox idea
was that everything in America is
all right just as it. is, and to this he
found it easy to respond. Ilis|
salary helped him to do so. And i
at last, the record says, lie became!
"laudator temporis aetai", one who
praises the times that are past. As i
such betook little part in the t ini |
that are to be.
So runs the allegory. How shall
it be with you? There are many
Thomsons among our scholars.!
There may be some among you.
W hen you pass from the world of
thought you will find yourself in a
world ot action. The conditions!
are not changed, but they may!
seem changed. How shall you re
spond to the seeming difference?!
Is the truth of high thinking to he |
given up for the appearance of I
speedy success?
1 112 you do t his it will be not t hal
you are worldly wise, but because;
you do not know the world. In!
your ignorance of men you will
sell yourself cheaply.
One must know life before he
can know truth. lie who would
be a leader of men must first have
the power to lead himself. The
world is selfish and unsympathetic.
Hut it is also sagacious. It rejects
as worthless him who suffers de
cadence when he conies in contact
with its vulgar cleverness. The
true man will teach truth wherever
he is, not because he has pledged
himself in (iermany not to teach
anything else, but because in teach
ing truth he is teaching himself,
llis life thus becomes a natural
life and to a natural life sooner or
later the world will respond. The
natural man can look the world
full in the face. The world knows
the value of genuineness, and it
yields to that force wherever it is
felt. "The world is all gates" says
Finer son, "all opportunities, strings
of tension waiting to be struck, the
Farthas sensitive as c.odine to
light, the most plastic and impres
sionable medium alive to every
touch."
Thus in the decadence of Thom
son it was not the times or the
world or America that was at fault;
it was Thompson himself. lit; had
in him no life of his own. His
knowledge like his microscope was
"made in (iermany,and bore not
his mark'but the mark of the (Jer
man factory. Truth was not made
in (iermany, and to know or to
teach truth there must be a life be
hind it.
The decadence of Thomson was
the appearance of the real Thom
son from under the axioms and
formula' his teachers had given
him. It was fortunate for Amer
ica that the real Thomson came to

the surface so soon, before any
thing important wan given him to i
spoil.
Men do not fail because they are
human. They are not human j
enough. Failure comes from lack i
of life. Only the man who has
forced convictions of his own and
who knows how convictions are
formed can ha ve the courage of his
convictions. Only such men can
teach the truth. Thomson had no
convictions. He had learned the
words of authority. Learning!
alone does not make a man strong.
Strength in life will show itself in
helpfulness, will show itself in sym
pathy, in sacrifice. "(ireat men"
says Kmerson, "feel that they are
so by renouncing their selfishness l
and falling back on what is human.
'They beat with the pulse and
breathe with the lungs of nations." i
It is not enough to know truth,
one must know men. It is not j
enough to know men, one must be
a man. Only he who can live truth
can know it. Only he who can live !
truth can teach it. "Ilecould talk
men over," says Carlyle of Mira
beau, "he could talk men over be-!
cause he could act men over. At
bottom that was it."
And this at bottom is the source
of all power and service. Not what!
a man knows or what he can say, j
but what is he? what can he do? j
Not what can he do for bis board
and lodging, as the slave who is
"hired for life"; but what can lie |
do out of the fullness of his resour
ces, the fullness of his helpfulness,
the fullness of himself. The work 1
the world will not let die was never
paid for —not in fame, not in money. \
not in power.
The decadence of literature, <>i j
which much is said today, is not '
due to the decadence of man. It is
not the effect of the nerve strain of
overwrought generations born too
late in the dusk of the ages. Its
nature is this, that uncritical and
untrained men have come into a
heritage they have not earned.
'They will pay money to have their
feeble fancy tickled. The decad
ence of literature is the struggle of
mountebanks to catch the public
eye. There is money in the litera
ture of decay, and those who work
for money have "verily their re
ward." Hut these performances
are not the work of men. They
have no relation to literature or art
or human life. 'These are not in
decadence because imitations are
sold on street corners or tossed into
our laps on railway trains. As
well say that gold is in its decad
ence because brass can be burnished
to look like it. Or that the sun is
in bis dotage because we have tilled
ourdooryard with Chinese lanterns.
Literature has never been paid
t for. Il has never asked the gold or
the plaudits of the multitude.
Job and Hamlet and Faust and
Lear were never created to till the
! pages of a Sunday newspaper. John
j Milton and John Huiivan were not
publishers' hacks, nor were John
! Hampden. John Hright, or Samuel
j Adams under pay as walking dele-
I gates of reform.
No man was hired to lind oul
that the world was round, or that
valleys were worn by water, or that
; the stars were suns. No man was
; paid to burn at the stake, or to die,
I that other men might be free to live.
The sane, strong, heroic of all
I ages, the men who were men in the
natural order of th ugs have lived
j above all considerations of pay or
glory. They have served the Lord,
not as slaves hoping for rewards,
1 >ut as gods who would take no re
wards. Men could not reward
Shakspere or Darwin or Newton
or 1 lelmholtz for their services any
more than they could pay the Lord
for the use of his sunshine. And
from the same inexhaustible divine
reservoir it all comes—the sacrifice
of meat men and the sunshine of
God.
"Thrice have 1 molded my image,
Ami thrice stretched forth my
hand:
Made one of day and one of night,
And one of the salt sea strand:
< >ne in a Judean manger,
And one by Avon's stream,
One over against the mouths of
the Nile,
And one in the Academe."
And in such image men are made
every day, not only in Judea or in
Stratford, not on the banks of the
Nile or the Arno, but on the banks
of the Columbia or the Sacramento,
it may be as well.
All over the earth, in this image,
are the sane and the sound and the
true. And when and where their
lives are spent arise generations of
others like tlieni: men in the true
order. Not alone men in the "im
age of God" but gods in the like
ness of nen.
It is to the training of the nat
ural man that the universities of
the world are devoted. They call
for the higher sacrifice, the sacrifice
of those who have powers not
needed in the common struggle of
life, and who have therefore some
thing over ami beyond this struggle
t<> give for their fellows. Large or
small, whatever their gift may lie,
the world needs it all, and to every
good gift the world shall respond a
thousand fold. For strength begets
strength and wisdom leads to wis
dom. " There is always room for
the man of force, and he makes
room for many. ' It is the strong,
the wise, the good of the past who
have made our lives possible. It is
these great human men, the men
"in the natural order," that have
made it possible for the plain com
mon men like you and me to live
rather than merely to vegetate.
We hear men among us some
times who complain of the
shortness of life, the sinallness of
truth, the limited stage on which
men are forced to act. Hut the
men who thus complain are not the
men vvlio have filled this little stage
with their action. 'The man who
has learned to serve the Lord never
complains that his master has not
given him enough to do. The man
who helps his fellow men does not
stand about with idle hands to find
men worthy his assistance. lie
who leads a worthy life never
vexes himself with the question as
to whether life is worth living. For
we know that all our powers are
products of the needs and duties of
our ancestors. Wisdom too great
to be translated into action is an
absurdity; for wisdom is only know
ing what it is best to do next; vir
tue is only doing it. To know and
to do is the essence of the highest
service. Those the world has a
right to honor are those who found
enough in the world to do. The
fields are always white to the har
vest, and the most each of them
can accomplish is to show the hosts
that follow how to make service ef
fective.
Alexander the Great had con
quered his neighbors in Greece and
Asia Minor, the only world he
knew. Then he sighed for more
worlds to conquer. Hut other
worlds he knew nothing of lay all
about him. The secrets of the
rocks be bad never suspected.
Steam, electricity, the growth of
trees, the fall of snow, ali these

were mysteries to him. The only
conquest he knew, the subjugation
iof men's bodies, went but a little
way. All the men who, in his life
time, knew the name of Alexander
the Great could find encampment
on the Palo Alto farm. The great
world of men in his day was be
yond his knowledge. His world
was a very small one, and of this
he had seen but a little corner.
The prowess of the cock victorious
on his own dunghill was of the
[ same nature as the glory of Alex
ander.
For the need of more worlds to
conquer is no badge of strength.
It is the stamp of ignorance. It is
the cry only of him who knows not
that the great earth about him still
stands unconquered.
No Lincoln ever wept that he
had not more nations to save; no
Luther that he had not more
churches to purify; no Darwin that
nature had not more hidden secrets
which he might follow to their
depths; no Agassiz that the
thoughts of God were all exhausted
before he was born.
And now a word to you as
scholars. The higher education
means the higher sacrifice. That
you are taught to know is simply
that you may do. That you know the
truth signifies only that you should
do the right. That you should
know and do has value only as
translated into justice and love.
Justice and love are not for your
selves. Their relations are with
others. There is no man so strong
as not to need your help. There is
no man so weak that you can not
make him stronger. There is no
man so sick that you can not bring
I liini to the "gate called 'beauti
ful.' " There is no evil in this
world that you can not help turn
into goodness.
"We could lift up this land,"
said Björnson of Norway, "if we
lifted as one." Therefore lift, and
lift as one. You are strong enough
and wise enough. You shall seek
strength and wisdom, that others
through you may be wiser and
stronger. You shall seek your
place to work, as your basis for
helpfulness. Others will make the
place as good as you deserve.
Wherever you go you shall be
teachers of men. Whether it be an
honored chair in a university, such
which wise men sometimes hold in
our day, or whether it be a rack or
cross, as other teachers than yours
have known in days that are past,
he remains a teacher. If his life
is sacrificed in helping men, it is to
the market of the ages he carries
his blood, and not to the milk mar
ket of Concord town. He will not
"pledge himself in Germany to
teach nothing which is not true."
Being true himself he can teach
nothing false. The more men of
the true order there are in the
world, the greater is the world's
need for men. When all are men,
slavery shall be no more.
As you are men, so will your
places in life be secure. Every
profession is calling for you. Ev
ery walk of life is waiting for your
effort. There will always be room
for you, and you will each of you
make room for many.
David Starr .Jordan addressed
the graduates as follows:
Slavery and freedom are together
in every human life. This goes
with the definition of life itself.
Each creature that lives must bend
its back to the lash of its environ
ment. We dream of life without
conditions, life free from the pres
sure of insensate things, without us
or within. lint such life is the
dream of philosophers. We have
never known it. The records of the
life we know are full of concessions
t<» such pressure. Each man is a
slave because he is a living being.
The vegetative part of life, that
part which finds its expression in
physical growth and sustenance
and death, must always be slavery.
The old primal hunger of the pro
toplasm rules it all. Each of the
myriad cells of which man is made
must be fed and cared for. The
perennial hunger of these cells he
must stifie. This hunger began
when life began. It will cease only
when life ceases. It will last till
the water of the sea is drained, the
great lights are put out, and the
empty and useless earth is hung up
in the archives of the universe with
the worlds that have been and are
no longer.
This old hunger the individual
man must each day meet and sat
isfy. lie must do ibis for himself,
else in the long run it will not be
done. If others help feed him, he
must feed others in return. This
return is not charity nor sacrifice:
ii is simply exchange of work. It
is the division of labor in servitude.
Directly or indirectly each must,
pay his debt of life. There are a
few, as the world goes, who in lux
ury or in pauperism have this debt
paid for them by others. But
there are not many of these fugitive
slaves. The number will never be
great, for the lineage of idleness is
never long or strong.
When tins debt is paid, the slave
becomes the man. Nature counts
as men only those who are free.
Freedom springs from within. No
outside power can give it. Hoard
and lodging on the earth once paid,
a man's resources are his own.
These he can give or hold. By the
fullness of these he is measured.
''As is the receipt," Emerson
tell us, "so is the gift." Ali acqui
sitions of man "are victories of the
good brain and brave heart: the
world belongs to the energetic, be
longs to the wise, it is in vain to
make a paradise but for good men."
In the ancient lore of the .lews,
so liabhi Voorsanger tells us. it is
written: "Serve the Lord, not as
slaves, hoping for reward, but as
gods who will take no reward." The
meaning of the old saying i> t his:
"Only the gods can serve."
Those wlio gain nothing, have
nothing to give, lie who lives as
a slave only serves himself. That
he hopes for reward shows that to
himself his service is really given.
To serve the Lord, according to Mn
ether old saying, is to help one's
fellow men. The Eternal asks not
of in<irtals thal they assist Him
with llis earlli. The tough old
world has been llis for centuries of
centuries. It came to be ours, and
we can neither make it nor mar it.
We were not consulted when its
foundations were laid in the deep.
The waves and the storm, the sun
shine and the song of birds need
not our aid. They will take care of
themselves. Life is the only ma
terial that is plastic to our hand.
Only man can be helped by man.
"As thou lovest me," Christ said to
Simon Peter, "as thou lovest me.
feed my lambs.*'
W hen they hung John Brown in

Virginia, many said, you remem
ber, that he had thrown away his
life and would gain nothing for it.
"He could not," as Thoreau said at
the time, "get a vote of thanks or a
pair of boots for his life. He could
not get four and-sixpence a day for
I being hung, take the year round."
1 But he was not asking fora vote of
thanks. It was not for the four
and-sixpence that he stood between
brute force and its victims. It was
to show men the nature of slavery.
It was to help his fellow citizens to
| read the story of their institutions
in the light of history. ''You can
get more fora quart of milk," Tho
reau went on to say, "in the market
at Concord than you can fora
quart of blood: but yours i> not the
market heroes carry their blood to."
The blood of heroes is not sold by
the quart. The great, strong, noble,
and pure of the world, those who
have made our race worthy to be
called men, have not been paid by
the day or by the quart, not by
riches nor fame nor power, nor any
thing that man can give. Out of
1 the fullness of their lives have they
i served the Lord. Out of their re
journs have they helped their ft' I -
I low men.
Only those who thus rise above
all matters of rank and fame and
j wages can live in the records of
| man. The great man can not be a
J self-seeker. The greatness of a Na
poleon or an Alexander is the
; greatness of gluttony. It is slavery
on a grand scale. What men have
done for their own glory or aggran
dizement has left no penna nent im
press. "1 have carried out noth
ing"' says the warrior, Sigurd
Slenibe; "I have not sown the least
grain nor laid one stone upon an
other to witness that I have lived."
jA Napoleon could have said as
much, if like Sigurd he could have
stood "upon his own grave and
heard the great bell ring."
What such men have torn down
remains torn down. It would
shortly have fa lien of itself, for that
which is destined to live can never
be torn down by force.
But what such men have built
has fallen when their hands have
ceased to hold it up. The names
history cherishes are men of an
(other type. Only "a man too sim
ply great to scheme for his proper
sell"' is great enough to become a
pi 11 a r of t he ages.
It is part of the duty of higher
education to build up ideals of no
ble freedom. It is not for help in
the vegetative work of life that one
goes to college. lie is just as good
a si a ve without it. He can earn
iiis board and lodging without the
formality of culture. The training
of the college will make his power
for action greater, no doubt, but it
will also magnify bis needs. The
debt of life a scholar lias to pay is
greater than that paid by theelown.
And the higher sacrifice the scholar
may be called upon to make grows
with the increased fullness of his
life, (ireater needs go with greater
power, and both mean greater op
port unities for sacrifice.
In the days you have been with
us, you should have formed some
ideals, you should have bound
these ideals together with thechain
of well spent yesterdays, which is
the first necessity toward making
tlieni real. You should have done
something in the direction of the
life of higher sacrifice, the life that
from the fullnessof its resources can
ha ve soniet liing to give.
The men you meet as you leave
these halls will not understand
these ideals. They will not know
that your life is not bound
up in the present, but has some
thing to ask or to give for the

future. Till they understand you,
tlley will not give you their svmpa
thies. They may jeer at you because
the whip they respond to leaves no
mark upon you. They will trv to
huv you, because the Devil has
always bid high for the lives of
young men with ideals. A man in
his market stands always above
par. Slaves are bis stock in trade.
If a man with power can be had for
base purposes, he can be sure of an
immediate reward. You can sell
your blood for its weight in milk or
for its weight in gold, whichever
you choose —if you are willing to
put it up for sale. You can sell
your will for the kingdoms of the
earth; and you will see or seem to
see many of your associates mak
ing just such bargains. Hut in
this be not deceived. No voting
man worthy of anything else ever
sold himself to the Devil. These
are dummy sales. The Devil puts
his own up at auction in hopes of
catching others. If you fell into
his hands, you had not far to fall.
You were already ripe for his
clutches, " let I bee behind me," is
a command Satan can never choose
but obey.
When a man steps forth from
the college he is tested once for all.
It takes bill a year or two lo prove
his mettle. In the college high
ideals prevail and the intellectual
life is taken as a matter of course.
In the world outside it appears
otherwise, though the conditions of
life are in fact just the same. It is
not true, though it .?eenis so, that
the common life is made up of
"grasping and griping with a u bine
for mercy at the end of it." It is
your own fault if you find it so.
It is not true that the thought of
man is occupied with the effort 'Mo
live just asking but to live." The
world of thought and the world of
action are one in essence. In both
truth is strength, and folly and
selfishness are weakness. There is
no confusion of right and wrong in
the mind of the fates. It is only
in our poor bewildered slave intel
lects that evil passes for power.
All about us in the press of life are
real men. .Men who can not be
bought nor sold, the men in whose
guidance the current of history
Hows.
'The lesson of value in life it
should be yours to teach, because
it should lie yours to know. Men
are better than they seem, and the
hidden virtues of life appear when
men have learned how to translate
them. Men grasp and hoard
material tilings because in their
poverty of soul they know of noth
ing else to do. It is lack of train
ing and lack of imagination rather
than total depravity which gives
our social life its sordid aspect.
When a plant has learned the
secret of flowers and fruit, it no
longer goes on adding meaningless
leaf to leaf. And as "flowers are
only colored leaves, fruit only ripe
ones. ' so are the virtues only per
fected and ripened forms of those
impulses which show themselves as
vices.
It is your relation to the over
flow of power that determines the
manner of man you are. Slave or
god, it is for you to choose. Slave
or god. it is for you to will. It is
for such choice that will is given.
Sav what we may about the limita
tions of th«* life of man, tliev are
largely self limitations. Hemmed
in is human life by the force of the
fates; but the will of man is one of
the fates, and can take it- place by
the side of the rest of them. I he
man who can will is a factor in the
universe. Only the who can will
can serve t he Lord at all, and by I he
same token, hoping for no reward.

Ina recent magazine, the Pinl,
Mr. \Y. P. Ueeves tells us a tale,
half humorous, liulf allegorical, of
the decadence of a scholar. Ac
cording to this story, one Thomson
was a college graduate, full of high
notions of the significance of life
and the duties and privileges of the
scholar. W illi these ideals he went
to (iermany, that he might
strengthen them and use them for
the benefit of his fellowmen. lie
spent some years in (iermany till
ing his mind with all that (ier
iii,'in philosophy could give. Then
he came home to turn his philoso
phy into action. To do this he
sought a college professorship.
This lie found it was not easy to
secure. Nobody cared for him or
his message. The authority of
I "'wise and sober (iermany" was not
recognized in the institutions of
America, and he found that col
lege professorships were no longer
"plums to be picked" by whomso
ever should ask for them. The
! reverence the (iernian professor
commands was unknown in Amer
ica.in (iermany, the authority of
wise men is supreme. Their words,
j when tiicy speak, are heard with
reverence and attention. In Amer
ica wisdom is not wisdom till tie
I common man has examined it and
pronounced it to be such. Ihe
conclusions of the scholar are re
vised by the daily newspaper. The
readers of these papers care little
for messages from I topia. Ihe
theories of the philosopher do not
concern them. No college opened
its door to Thomson, and he saw
.with dismay that the li'e before
him was one of discomfort and
insignificance, his ideals having no
exchangeable value in luxuries or
comforts. Meanwhile Thomson's
early associates seemed to get on
somehow. The world wanted their
cheap achievements, though it did
not care for him.
One of these was one Wilcox,
i and though small in abilities and
poor in virtues, bis infiiience seemed
to be unbounded. The young
woman who had felt an interest
in Thomson's development aml to
whom he had read his rejected ver
ses and his uncalled for philosophy,
had joined herself to the Philistines
and yielded to their influence. She
had become \\ ilcox s wife. II is
friends regarded I honison s failure
as a joke. lle must not take liini
; self too seriously. A man rdiouhl
be in touch with his times. "Kven
Philistia," one said, ''has its tes
t hetic rit ua I and pageant ry." A
wise man man will not despise this
ritual, because Philistinism after
all is the life of the world.
Hut Thomson held out. "I
pledged my word in (iermany," he
said, "to teach nothing that I did
not believe to he true. 1 must live
up to this pledge." And so he
sought for positions and failed to
find them. Finally lie had a mes
sage from a friend that a professor
ship was vacant in a certain insti
tution. This message said: "culti
vate Wilcox.'' So in despair Thom
son began to "Cultivate Wilcox."
lie began to feel that Wilcox was a 1
type of the world, a bad world for
which he was not responsible. The)
world's servant he must be if
he received its wages. When he I
secured the appointment through
the political pull of Wilcox and
the mild kindness of Mrs. Wilcox
he was ready to teach whatever
was wanted of him, whether it w;isl
truth in (iermany or not. lie;
found that he could change his
notions of truth. The W ilcox idea
was that everything in America is
all right just as it. is, and to this he
found it easy to respond. Ilis|
salary helped him to do so. And i
at last, the record says, lie became!
"laudator temporis aetai", one who
praises the times that are past. As i
such betook little part in the t ini |
that are to be.
So runs the allegory. How shall
it be with you? There are many
Thomsons among our scholars.!
There may be some among you.
W hen you pass from the world of
thought you will find yourself in a
world ot action. The conditions!
are not changed, but they may!
seem changed. How shall you re
spond to the seeming difference?!
Is the truth of high thinking to he |
given up for the appearance of I
speedy success?
1 112 you do t his it will be not t hal
you are worldly wise, but because;
you do not know the world. In!
your ignorance of men you will
sell yourself cheaply.
One must know life before he
can know truth. lie who would
be a leader of men must first have
the power to lead himself. The
world is selfish and unsympathetic.
Hut it is also sagacious. It rejects
as worthless him who suffers de
cadence when he conies in contact
with its vulgar cleverness. The
true man will teach truth wherever
he is, not because he has pledged
himself in (iermany not to teach
anything else, but because in teach
ing truth he is teaching himself,
llis life thus becomes a natural
life and to a natural life sooner or
later the world will respond. The
natural man can look the world
full in the face. The world knows
the value of genuineness, and it
yields to that force wherever it is
felt. "The world is all gates" says
Finer son, "all opportunities, strings
of tension waiting to be struck, the
Farthas sensitive as c.odine to
light, the most plastic and impres
sionable medium alive to every
touch."
Thus in the decadence of Thom
son it was not the times or the
world or America that was at fault;
it was Thompson himself. lit; had
in him no life of his own. His
knowledge like his microscope was
"made in (iermany,and bore not
his mark'but the mark of the (Jer
man factory. Truth was not made
in (iermany, and to know or to
teach truth there must be a life be
hind it.
The decadence of Thomson was
the appearance of the real Thom
son from under the axioms and
formula' his teachers had given
him. It was fortunate for Amer
ica that the real Thomson came to

the surface so soon, before any
thing important wan given him to i
spoil.
Men do not fail because they are
human. They are not human j
enough. Failure comes from lack i
of life. Only the man who has
forced convictions of his own and
who knows how convictions are
formed can ha ve the courage of his
convictions. Only such men can
teach the truth. Thomson had no
convictions. He had learned the
words of authority. Learning!
alone does not make a man strong.
Strength in life will show itself in
helpfulness, will show itself in sym
pathy, in sacrifice. "(ireat men"
says Kmerson, "feel that they are
so by renouncing their selfishness l
and falling back on what is human.
'They beat with the pulse and
breathe with the lungs of nations." i
It is not enough to know truth,
one must know men. It is not j
enough to know men, one must be
a man. Only he who can live truth
can know it. Only he who can live !
truth can teach it. "Ilecould talk
men over," says Carlyle of Mira
beau, "he could talk men over be-!
cause he could act men over. At
bottom that was it."
And this at bottom is the source
of all power and service. Not what!
a man knows or what he can say, j
but what is he? what can he do? j
Not what can he do for bis board
and lodging, as the slave who is
"hired for life"; but what can lie |
do out of the fullness of his resour
ces, the fullness of his helpfulness,
the fullness of himself. The work 1
the world will not let die was never
paid for —not in fame, not in money. \
not in power.
The decadence of literature, <>i j
which much is said today, is not '
due to the decadence of man. It is
not the effect of the nerve strain of
overwrought generations born too
late in the dusk of the ages. Its
nature is this, that uncritical and
untrained men have come into a
heritage they have not earned.
'They will pay money to have their
feeble fancy tickled. The decad
ence of literature is the struggle of
mountebanks to catch the public
eye. There is money in the litera
ture of decay, and those who work
for money have "verily their re
ward." Hut these performances
are not the work of men. They
have no relation to literature or art
or human life. 'These are not in
decadence because imitations are
sold on street corners or tossed into
our laps on railway trains. As
well say that gold is in its decad
ence because brass can be burnished
to look like it. Or that the sun is
in bis dotage because we have tilled
ourdooryard with Chinese lanterns.
Literature has never been paid
t for. Il has never asked the gold or
the plaudits of the multitude.
Job and Hamlet and Faust and
Lear were never created to till the
! pages of a Sunday newspaper. John
j Milton and John Huiivan were not
publishers' hacks, nor were John
! Hampden. John Hright, or Samuel
j Adams under pay as walking dele-
I gates of reform.
No man was hired to lind oul
that the world was round, or that
valleys were worn by water, or that
; the stars were suns. No man was
; paid to burn at the stake, or to die,
I that other men might be free to live.
The sane, strong, heroic of all
I ages, the men who were men in the
natural order of th ugs have lived
j above all considerations of pay or
glory. They have served the Lord,
not as slaves hoping for rewards,
1 >ut as gods who would take no re
wards. Men could not reward
Shakspere or Darwin or Newton
or 1 lelmholtz for their services any
more than they could pay the Lord
for the use of his sunshine. And
from the same inexhaustible divine
reservoir it all comes—the sacrifice
of meat men and the sunshine of
God.
"Thrice have 1 molded my image,
Ami thrice stretched forth my
hand:
Made one of day and one of night,
And one of the salt sea strand:
< >ne in a Judean manger,
And one by Avon's stream,
One over against the mouths of
the Nile,
And one in the Academe."
And in such image men are made
every day, not only in Judea or in
Stratford, not on the banks of the
Nile or the Arno, but on the banks
of the Columbia or the Sacramento,
it may be as well.
All over the earth, in this image,
are the sane and the sound and the
true. And when and where their
lives are spent arise generations of
others like tlieni: men in the true
order. Not alone men in the "im
age of God" but gods in the like
ness of nen.
It is to the training of the nat
ural man that the universities of
the world are devoted. They call
for the higher sacrifice, the sacrifice
of those who have powers not
needed in the common struggle of
life, and who have therefore some
thing over ami beyond this struggle
t<> give for their fellows. Large or
small, whatever their gift may lie,
the world needs it all, and to every
good gift the world shall respond a
thousand fold. For strength begets
strength and wisdom leads to wis
dom. " There is always room for
the man of force, and he makes
room for many. ' It is the strong,
the wise, the good of the past who
have made our lives possible. It is
these great human men, the men
"in the natural order," that have
made it possible for the plain com
mon men like you and me to live
rather than merely to vegetate.
We hear men among us some
times who complain of the
shortness of life, the sinallness of
truth, the limited stage on which
men are forced to act. Hut the
men who thus complain are not the
men vvlio have filled this little stage
with their action. 'The man who
has learned to serve the Lord never
complains that his master has not
given him enough to do. The man
who helps his fellow men does not
stand about with idle hands to find
men worthy his assistance. lie
who leads a worthy life never
vexes himself with the question as
to whether life is worth living. For
we know that all our powers are
products of the needs and duties of
our ancestors. Wisdom too great
to be translated into action is an
absurdity; for wisdom is only know
ing what it is best to do next; vir
tue is only doing it. To know and
to do is the essence of the highest
service. Those the world has a
right to honor are those who found
enough in the world to do. The
fields are always white to the har
vest, and the most each of them
can accomplish is to show the hosts
that follow how to make service ef
fective.
Alexander the Great had con
quered his neighbors in Greece and
Asia Minor, the only world he
knew. Then he sighed for more
worlds to conquer. Hut other
worlds he knew nothing of lay all
about him. The secrets of the
rocks be bad never suspected.
Steam, electricity, the growth of
trees, the fall of snow, ali these

were mysteries to him. The only
conquest he knew, the subjugation
iof men's bodies, went but a little
way. All the men who, in his life
time, knew the name of Alexander
the Great could find encampment
on the Palo Alto farm. The great
world of men in his day was be
yond his knowledge. His world
was a very small one, and of this
he had seen but a little corner.
The prowess of the cock victorious
on his own dunghill was of the
[ same nature as the glory of Alex
ander.
For the need of more worlds to
conquer is no badge of strength.
It is the stamp of ignorance. It is
the cry only of him who knows not
that the great earth about him still
stands unconquered.
No Lincoln ever wept that he
had not more nations to save; no
Luther that he had not more
churches to purify; no Darwin that
nature had not more hidden secrets
which he might follow to their
depths; no Agassiz that the
thoughts of God were all exhausted
before he was born.
And now a word to you as
scholars. The higher education
means the higher sacrifice. That
you are taught to know is simply
that you may do. That you know the
truth signifies only that you should
do the right. That you should
know and do has value only as
translated into justice and love.
Justice and love are not for your
selves. Their relations are with
others. There is no man so strong
as not to need your help. There is
no man so weak that you can not
make him stronger. There is no
man so sick that you can not bring
I liini to the "gate called 'beauti
ful.' " There is no evil in this
world that you can not help turn
into goodness.
"We could lift up this land,"
said Björnson of Norway, "if we
lifted as one." Therefore lift, and
lift as one. You are strong enough
and wise enough. You shall seek
strength and wisdom, that others
through you may be wiser and
stronger. You shall seek your
place to work, as your basis for
helpfulness. Others will make the
place as good as you deserve.
Wherever you go you shall be
teachers of men. Whether it be an
honored chair in a university, such
which wise men sometimes hold in
our day, or whether it be a rack or
cross, as other teachers than yours
have known in days that are past,
he remains a teacher. If his life
is sacrificed in helping men, it is to
the market of the ages he carries
his blood, and not to the milk mar
ket of Concord town. He will not
"pledge himself in Germany to
teach nothing which is not true."
Being true himself he can teach
nothing false. The more men of
the true order there are in the
world, the greater is the world's
need for men. When all are men,
slavery shall be no more.
As you are men, so will your
places in life be secure. Every
profession is calling for you. Ev
ery walk of life is waiting for your
effort. There will always be room
for you, and you will each of you
make room for many.
David Starr .Jordan addressed
the graduates as follows:
Slavery and freedom are together
in every human life. This goes
with the definition of life itself.
Each creature that lives must bend
its back to the lash of its environ
ment. We dream of life without
conditions, life free from the pres
sure of insensate things, without us
or within. lint such life is the
dream of philosophers. We have
never known it. The records of the
life we know are full of concessions
t<» such pressure. Each man is a
slave because he is a living being.
The vegetative part of life, that
part which finds its expression in
physical growth and sustenance
and death, must always be slavery.
The old primal hunger of the pro
toplasm rules it all. Each of the
myriad cells of which man is made
must be fed and cared for. The
perennial hunger of these cells he
must stifie. This hunger began
when life began. It will cease only
when life ceases. It will last till
the water of the sea is drained, the
great lights are put out, and the
empty and useless earth is hung up
in the archives of the universe with
the worlds that have been and are
no longer.
This old hunger the individual
man must each day meet and sat
isfy. lie must do ibis for himself,
else in the long run it will not be
done. If others help feed him, he
must feed others in return. This
return is not charity nor sacrifice:
ii is simply exchange of work. It
is the division of labor in servitude.
Directly or indirectly each must,
pay his debt of life. There are a
few, as the world goes, who in lux
ury or in pauperism have this debt
paid for them by others. But
there are not many of these fugitive
slaves. The number will never be
great, for the lineage of idleness is
never long or strong.
When tins debt is paid, the slave
becomes the man. Nature counts
as men only those who are free.
Freedom springs from within. No
outside power can give it. Hoard
and lodging on the earth once paid,
a man's resources are his own.
These he can give or hold. By the
fullness of these he is measured.
''As is the receipt," Emerson
tell us, "so is the gift." Ali acqui
sitions of man "are victories of the
good brain and brave heart: the
world belongs to the energetic, be
longs to the wise, it is in vain to
make a paradise but for good men."
In the ancient lore of the .lews,
so liabhi Voorsanger tells us. it is
written: "Serve the Lord, not as
slaves, hoping for reward, but as
gods who will take no reward." The
meaning of the old saying i> t his:
"Only the gods can serve."
Those wlio gain nothing, have
nothing to give, lie who lives as
a slave only serves himself. That
he hopes for reward shows that to
himself his service is really given.
To serve the Lord, according to Mn
ether old saying, is to help one's
fellow men. The Eternal asks not
of in<irtals thal they assist Him
with llis earlli. The tough old
world has been llis for centuries of
centuries. It came to be ours, and
we can neither make it nor mar it.
We were not consulted when its
foundations were laid in the deep.
The waves and the storm, the sun
shine and the song of birds need
not our aid. They will take care of
themselves. Life is the only ma
terial that is plastic to our hand.
Only man can be helped by man.
"As thou lovest me," Christ said to
Simon Peter, "as thou lovest me.
feed my lambs.*'
W hen they hung John Brown in

Virginia, many said, you remem
ber, that he had thrown away his
life and would gain nothing for it.
"He could not," as Thoreau said at
the time, "get a vote of thanks or a
pair of boots for his life. He could
not get four and-sixpence a day for
I being hung, take the year round."
1 But he was not asking fora vote of
thanks. It was not for the four
and-sixpence that he stood between
brute force and its victims. It was
to show men the nature of slavery.
It was to help his fellow citizens to
| read the story of their institutions
in the light of history. ''You can
get more fora quart of milk," Tho
reau went on to say, "in the market
at Concord than you can fora
quart of blood: but yours i> not the
market heroes carry their blood to."
The blood of heroes is not sold by
the quart. The great, strong, noble,
and pure of the world, those who
have made our race worthy to be
called men, have not been paid by
the day or by the quart, not by
riches nor fame nor power, nor any
thing that man can give. Out of
1 the fullness of their lives have they
i served the Lord. Out of their re
journs have they helped their ft' I -
I low men.
Only those who thus rise above
all matters of rank and fame and
j wages can live in the records of
| man. The great man can not be a
J self-seeker. The greatness of a Na
poleon or an Alexander is the
; greatness of gluttony. It is slavery
on a grand scale. What men have
done for their own glory or aggran
dizement has left no penna nent im
press. "1 have carried out noth
ing"' says the warrior, Sigurd
Slenibe; "I have not sown the least
grain nor laid one stone upon an
other to witness that I have lived."
jA Napoleon could have said as
much, if like Sigurd he could have
stood "upon his own grave and
heard the great bell ring."
What such men have torn down
remains torn down. It would
shortly have fa lien of itself, for that
which is destined to live can never
be torn down by force.
But what such men have built
has fallen when their hands have
ceased to hold it up. The names
history cherishes are men of an
(other type. Only "a man too sim
ply great to scheme for his proper
sell"' is great enough to become a
pi 11 a r of t he ages.
It is part of the duty of higher
education to build up ideals of no
ble freedom. It is not for help in
the vegetative work of life that one
goes to college. lie is just as good
a si a ve without it. He can earn
iiis board and lodging without the
formality of culture. The training
of the college will make his power
for action greater, no doubt, but it
will also magnify bis needs. The
debt of life a scholar lias to pay is
greater than that paid by theelown.
And the higher sacrifice the scholar
may be called upon to make grows
with the increased fullness of his
life, (ireater needs go with greater
power, and both mean greater op
port unities for sacrifice.
In the days you have been with
us, you should have formed some
ideals, you should have bound
these ideals together with thechain
of well spent yesterdays, which is
the first necessity toward making
tlieni real. You should have done
something in the direction of the
life of higher sacrifice, the life that
from the fullnessof its resources can
ha ve soniet liing to give.
The men you meet as you leave
these halls will not understand
these ideals. They will not know
that your life is not bound
up in the present, but has some
thing to ask or to give for the

future. Till they understand you,
tlley will not give you their svmpa
thies. They may jeer at you because
the whip they respond to leaves no
mark upon you. They will trv to
huv you, because the Devil has
always bid high for the lives of
young men with ideals. A man in
his market stands always above
par. Slaves are bis stock in trade.
If a man with power can be had for
base purposes, he can be sure of an
immediate reward. You can sell
your blood for its weight in milk or
for its weight in gold, whichever
you choose —if you are willing to
put it up for sale. You can sell
your will for the kingdoms of the
earth; and you will see or seem to
see many of your associates mak
ing just such bargains. Hut in
this be not deceived. No voting
man worthy of anything else ever
sold himself to the Devil. These
are dummy sales. The Devil puts
his own up at auction in hopes of
catching others. If you fell into
his hands, you had not far to fall.
You were already ripe for his
clutches, " let I bee behind me," is
a command Satan can never choose
but obey.
When a man steps forth from
the college he is tested once for all.
It takes bill a year or two lo prove
his mettle. In the college high
ideals prevail and the intellectual
life is taken as a matter of course.
In the world outside it appears
otherwise, though the conditions of
life are in fact just the same. It is
not true, though it .?eenis so, that
the common life is made up of
"grasping and griping with a u bine
for mercy at the end of it." It is
your own fault if you find it so.
It is not true that the thought of
man is occupied with the effort 'Mo
live just asking but to live." The
world of thought and the world of
action are one in essence. In both
truth is strength, and folly and
selfishness are weakness. There is
no confusion of right and wrong in
the mind of the fates. It is only
in our poor bewildered slave intel
lects that evil passes for power.
All about us in the press of life are
real men. .Men who can not be
bought nor sold, the men in whose
guidance the current of history
Hows.
'The lesson of value in life it
should be yours to teach, because
it should lie yours to know. Men
are better than they seem, and the
hidden virtues of life appear when
men have learned how to translate
them. Men grasp and hoard
material tilings because in their
poverty of soul they know of noth

than total depravity which gives
our social life its sordid aspect.
When a plant has learned the
secret of flowers and fruit, it no
longer goes on adding meaningless
leaf to leaf. And as "flowers are
only colored leaves, fruit only ripe
ones. ' so are the virtues only per
fected and ripened forms of those
impulses which show themselves as
vices.
It is your relation to the over
flow of power that determines the
manner of man you are. Slave or
god, it is for you to choose. Slave
or god. it is for you to will. It is
for such choice that will is given.
Sav what we may about the limita
tions of th«* life of man, tliev are
largely self limitations. Hemmed
in is human life by the force of the
fates; but the will of man is one of
the fates, and can take it- place by
the side of the rest of them. I he
man who can will is a factor in the
universe. Only the who can will
can serve t he Lord at all, and by I he
same token, hoping for no reward.

Ina recent magazine, the Pinl,
Mr. \Y. P. Ueeves tells us a tale,
half humorous, liulf allegorical, of
the decadence of a scholar. Ac
cording to this story, one Thomson
was a college graduate, full of high
notions of the significance of life
and the duties and privileges of the
scholar. W illi these ideals he went
to (iermany, that he might
strengthen them and use them for
the benefit of his fellowmen. lie
spent some years in (iermany till
ing his mind with all that (ier
iii,'in philosophy could give. Then
he came home to turn his philoso
phy into action. To do this he
sought a college professorship.
This lie found it was not easy to
secure. Nobody cared for him or
his message. The authority of
I "'wise and sober (iermany" was not
recognized in the institutions of
America, and he found that col
lege professorships were no longer
"plums to be picked" by whomso
ever should ask for them. The
! reverence the (iernian professor
commands was unknown in Amer
ica.in (iermany, the authority of
wise men is supreme. Their words,
j when tiicy speak, are heard with
reverence and attention. In Amer
ica wisdom is not wisdom till tie
I common man has examined it and
pronounced it to be such. Ihe
conclusions of the scholar are re
vised by the daily newspaper. The
readers of these papers care little
for messages from I topia. Ihe
theories of the philosopher do not
concern them. No college opened
its door to Thomson, and he saw
.with dismay that the li'e before
him was one of discomfort and
insignificance, his ideals having no
exchangeable value in luxuries or
comforts. Meanwhile Thomson's
early associates seemed to get on
somehow. The world wanted their
cheap achievements, though it did
not care for him.
One of these was one Wilcox,
i and though small in abilities and
poor in virtues, bis infiiience seemed
to be unbounded. The young
woman who had felt an interest
in Thomson's development aml to
whom he had read his rejected ver
ses and his uncalled for philosophy,
had joined herself to the Philistines
and yielded to their influence. She
had become \\ ilcox s wife. II is
friends regarded I honison s failure
as a joke. lle must not take liini
; self too seriously. A man rdiouhl
be in touch with his times. "Kven
Philistia," one said, ''has its tes
t hetic rit ua I and pageant ry." A
wise man man will not despise this
ritual, because Philistinism after
all is the life of the world.
Hut Thomson held out. "I
pledged my word in (iermany," he
said, "to teach nothing that I did
not believe to he true. 1 must live
up to this pledge." And so he
sought for positions and failed to
find them. Finally lie had a mes
sage from a friend that a professor
ship was vacant in a certain insti
tution. This message said: "culti
vate Wilcox.'' So in despair Thom
son began to "Cultivate Wilcox."
lie began to feel that Wilcox was a 1
type of the world, a bad world for
which he was not responsible. The)
world's servant he must be if
he received its wages. When he I
secured the appointment through
the political pull of Wilcox and
the mild kindness of Mrs. Wilcox
he was ready to teach whatever
was wanted of him, whether it w;isl
truth in (iermany or not. lie;
found that he could change his
notions of truth. The W ilcox idea
was that everything in America is
all right just as it. is, and to this he
found it easy to respond. Ilis|
salary helped him to do so. And i
at last, the record says, lie became!
"laudator temporis aetai", one who
praises the times that are past. As i
such betook little part in the t ini |
that are to be.
So runs the allegory. How shall
it be with you? There are many
Thomsons among our scholars.!
There may be some among you.
W hen you pass from the world of
thought you will find yourself in a
world ot action. The conditions!
are not changed, but they may!
seem changed. How shall you re
spond to the seeming difference?!
Is the truth of high thinking to he |
given up for the appearance of I
speedy success?
1 112 you do t his it will be not t hal
you are worldly wise, but because;
you do not know the world. In!
your ignorance of men you will
sell yourself cheaply.
One must know life before he
can know truth. lie who would
be a leader of men must first have
the power to lead himself. The
world is selfish and unsympathetic.
Hut it is also sagacious. It rejects
as worthless him who suffers de
cadence when he conies in contact
with its vulgar cleverness. The
true man will teach truth wherever
he is, not because he has pledged
himself in (iermany not to teach
anything else, but because in teach
ing truth he is teaching himself,
llis life thus becomes a natural
life and to a natural life sooner or
later the world will respond. The
natural man can look the world
full in the face. The world knows
the value of genuineness, and it
yields to that force wherever it is
felt. "The world is all gates" says
Finer son, "all opportunities, strings
of tension waiting to be struck, the
Farthas sensitive as c.odine to
light, the most plastic and impres
sionable medium alive to every
touch."
Thus in the decadence of Thom
son it was not the times or the
world or America that was at fault;
it was Thompson himself. lit; had
in him no life of his own. His
knowledge like his microscope was
"made in (iermany,and bore not
his mark'but the mark of the (Jer
man factory. Truth was not made
in (iermany, and to know or to
teach truth there must be a life be
hind it.
The decadence of Thomson was
the appearance of the real Thom
son from under the axioms and
formula' his teachers had given
him. It was fortunate for Amer
ica that the real Thomson came to

the surface so soon, before any
thing important wan given him to i
spoil.
Men do not fail because they are
human. They are not human j
enough. Failure comes from lack i
of life. Only the man who has
forced convictions of his own and
who knows how convictions are
formed can ha ve the courage of his
convictions. Only such men can
teach the truth. Thomson had no
convictions. He had learned the
words of authority. Learning!
alone does not make a man strong.
Strength in life will show itself in
helpfulness, will show itself in sym
pathy, in sacrifice. "(ireat men"
says Kmerson, "feel that they are
so by renouncing their selfishness l
and falling back on what is human.
'They beat with the pulse and
breathe with the lungs of nations." i
It is not enough to know truth,
one must know men. It is not j
enough to know men, one must be
a man. Only he who can live truth
can know it. Only he who can live !
truth can teach it. "Ilecould talk
men over," says Carlyle of Mira
beau, "he could talk men over be-!
cause he could act men over. At
bottom that was it."
And this at bottom is the source
of all power and service. Not what!
a man knows or what he can say, j
but what is he? what can he do? j
Not what can he do for bis board
and lodging, as the slave who is
"hired for life"; but what can lie |
do out of the fullness of his resour
ces, the fullness of his helpfulness,
the fullness of himself. The work 1
the world will not let die was never
paid for —not in fame, not in money. \
not in power.
The decadence of literature, <>i j
which much is said today, is not '
due to the decadence of man. It is
not the effect of the nerve strain of
overwrought generations born too
late in the dusk of the ages. Its
nature is this, that uncritical and
untrained men have come into a
heritage they have not earned.
'They will pay money to have their
feeble fancy tickled. The decad
ence of literature is the struggle of
mountebanks to catch the public
eye. There is money in the litera
ture of decay, and those who work
for money have "verily their re
ward." Hut these performances
are not the work of men. They
have no relation to literature or art
or human life. 'These are not in
decadence because imitations are
sold on street corners or tossed into
our laps on railway trains. As
well say that gold is in its decad
ence because brass can be burnished
to look like it. Or that the sun is
in bis dotage because we have tilled
ourdooryard with Chinese lanterns.
Literature has never been paid
t for. Il has never asked the gold or
the plaudits of the multitude.
Job and Hamlet and Faust and
Lear were never created to till the
! pages of a Sunday newspaper. John
j Milton and John Huiivan were not
publishers' hacks, nor were John
! Hampden. John Hright, or Samuel
j Adams under pay as walking dele-
I gates of reform.
No man was hired to lind oul
that the world was round, or that
valleys were worn by water, or that
; the stars were suns. No man was
; paid to burn at the stake, or to die,
I that other men might be free to live.
The sane, strong, heroic of all
I ages, the men who were men in the
natural order of th ugs have lived
j above all considerations of pay or
glory. They have served the Lord,
not as slaves hoping for rewards,
1 >ut as gods who would take no re
wards. Men could not reward
Shakspere or Darwin or Newton
or 1 lelmholtz for their services any
more than they could pay the Lord
for the use of his sunshine. And
from the same inexhaustible divine
reservoir it all comes—the sacrifice
of meat men and the sunshine of
God.
"Thrice have 1 molded my image,
Ami thrice stretched forth my
hand:
Made one of day and one of night,
And one of the salt sea strand:
< >ne in a Judean manger,
And one by Avon's stream,
One over against the mouths of
the Nile,
And one in the Academe."
And in such image men are made
every day, not only in Judea or in
Stratford, not on the banks of the
Nile or the Arno, but on the banks
of the Columbia or the Sacramento,
it may be as well.
All over the earth, in this image,
are the sane and the sound and the
true. And when and where their
lives are spent arise generations of
others like tlieni: men in the true
order. Not alone men in the "im
age of God" but gods in the like
ness of nen.
It is to the training of the nat
ural man that the universities of
the world are devoted. They call
for the higher sacrifice, the sacrifice
of those who have powers not
needed in the common struggle of
life, and who have therefore some
thing over ami beyond this struggle
t<> give for their fellows. Large or
small, whatever their gift may lie,
the world needs it all, and to every
good gift the world shall respond a
thousand fold. For strength begets
strength and wisdom leads to wis
dom. " There is always room for
the man of force, and he makes
room for many. ' It is the strong,
the wise, the good of the past who
have made our lives possible. It is
these great human men, the men
"in the natural order," that have
made it possible for the plain com
mon men like you and me to live
rather than merely to vegetate.
We hear men among us some
times who complain of the
shortness of life, the sinallness of
truth, the limited stage on which
men are forced to act. Hut the
men who thus complain are not the
men vvlio have filled this little stage
with their action. 'The man who
has learned to serve the Lord never
complains that his master has not
given him enough to do. The man
who helps his fellow men does not
stand about with idle hands to find
men worthy his assistance. lie
who leads a worthy life never
vexes himself with the question as
to whether life is worth living. For
we know that all our powers are
products of the needs and duties of
our ancestors. Wisdom too great
to be translated into action is an
absurdity; for wisdom is only know
ing what it is best to do next; vir
tue is only doing it. To know and
to do is the essence of the highest
service. Those the world has a
right to honor are those who found
enough in the world to do. The
fields are always white to the har
vest, and the most each of them
can accomplish is to show the hosts
that follow how to make service ef
fective.
Alexander the Great had con
quered his neighbors in Greece and
Asia Minor, the only world he
knew. Then he sighed for more
worlds to conquer. Hut other
worlds he knew nothing of lay all
about him. The secrets of the
rocks be bad never suspected.
Steam, electricity, the growth of
trees, the fall of snow, ali these

were mysteries to him. The only
conquest he knew, the subjugation
iof men's bodies, went but a little
way. All the men who, in his life
time, knew the name of Alexander
the Great could find encampment
on the Palo Alto farm. The great
world of men in his day was be
yond his knowledge. His world
was a very small one, and of this
he had seen but a little corner.
The prowess of the cock victorious
on his own dunghill was of the
[ same nature as the glory of Alex
ander.
For the need of more worlds to
conquer is no badge of strength.
It is the stamp of ignorance. It is
the cry only of him who knows not
that the great earth about him still
stands unconquered.
No Lincoln ever wept that he
had not more nations to save; no
Luther that he had not more
churches to purify; no Darwin that
nature had not more hidden secrets
which he might follow to their
depths; no Agassiz that the
thoughts of God were all exhausted
before he was born.
And now a word to you as
scholars. The higher education
means the higher sacrifice. That
you are taught to know is simply
that you may do. That you know the
truth signifies only that you should
do the right. That you should
know and do has value only as
translated into justice and love.
Justice and love are not for your
selves. Their relations are with
others. There is no man so strong
as not to need your help. There is
no man so weak that you can not
make him stronger. There is no
man so sick that you can not bring
I liini to the "gate called 'beauti
ful.' " There is no evil in this
world that you can not help turn
into goodness.
"We could lift up this land,"
said Björnson of Norway, "if we
lifted as one." Therefore lift, and
lift as one. You are strong enough
and wise enough. You shall seek
strength and wisdom, that others
through you may be wiser and
stronger. You shall seek your
place to work, as your basis for
helpfulness. Others will make the
place as good as you deserve.
Wherever you go you shall be
teachers of men. Whether it be an
honored chair in a university, such
which wise men sometimes hold in
our day, or whether it be a rack or
cross, as other teachers than yours
have known in days that are past,
he remains a teacher. If his life
is sacrificed in helping men, it is to
the market of the ages he carries
his blood, and not to the milk mar
ket of Concord town. He will not
"pledge himself in Germany to
teach nothing which is not true."
Being true himself he can teach
nothing false. The more men of
the true order there are in the
world, the greater is the world's
need for men. When all are men,
slavery shall be no more.
As you are men, so will your
places in life be secure. Every
profession is calling for you. Ev
ery walk of life is waiting for your
effort. There will always be room
for you, and you will each of you
make room for many.
