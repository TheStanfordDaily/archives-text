David Starr .Jordan addressed
the graduates as follows:
Slavery and freedom are together
in every human life. This goes
with the definition of life itself.
Each creature that lives must bend
its back to the lash of its environ
ment. We dream of life without
conditions, life free from the pres
sure of insensate things, without us
or within. lint such life is the
dream of philosophers. We have
never known it. The records of the
life we know are full of concessions
t<» such pressure. Each man is a
slave because he is a living being.
The vegetative part of life, that
part which finds its expression in
physical growth and sustenance
and death, must always be slavery.
The old primal hunger of the pro
toplasm rules it all. Each of the
myriad cells of which man is made
must be fed and cared for. The
perennial hunger of these cells he
must stifie. This hunger began
when life began. It will cease only
when life ceases. It will last till
the water of the sea is drained, the
great lights are put out, and the
empty and useless earth is hung up
in the archives of the universe with
the worlds that have been and are
no longer.
This old hunger the individual
man must each day meet and sat
isfy. lie must do ibis for himself,
else in the long run it will not be
done. If others help feed him, he
must feed others in return. This
return is not charity nor sacrifice:
ii is simply exchange of work. It
is the division of labor in servitude.
Directly or indirectly each must,
pay his debt of life. There are a
few, as the world goes, who in lux
ury or in pauperism have this debt
paid for them by others. But
there are not many of these fugitive
slaves. The number will never be
great, for the lineage of idleness is
never long or strong.
When tins debt is paid, the slave
becomes the man. Nature counts
as men only those who are free.
Freedom springs from within. No
outside power can give it. Hoard
and lodging on the earth once paid,
a man's resources are his own.
These he can give or hold. By the
fullness of these he is measured.
''As is the receipt," Emerson
tell us, "so is the gift." Ali acqui
sitions of man "are victories of the
good brain and brave heart: the
world belongs to the energetic, be
longs to the wise, it is in vain to
make a paradise but for good men."
In the ancient lore of the .lews,
so liabhi Voorsanger tells us. it is
written: "Serve the Lord, not as
slaves, hoping for reward, but as
gods who will take no reward." The
meaning of the old saying i> t his:
"Only the gods can serve."
Those wlio gain nothing, have
nothing to give, lie who lives as
a slave only serves himself. That
he hopes for reward shows that to
himself his service is really given.
To serve the Lord, according to Mn
ether old saying, is to help one's
fellow men. The Eternal asks not
of in<irtals thal they assist Him
with llis earlli. The tough old
world has been llis for centuries of
centuries. It came to be ours, and
we can neither make it nor mar it.
We were not consulted when its
foundations were laid in the deep.
The waves and the storm, the sun
shine and the song of birds need
not our aid. They will take care of
themselves. Life is the only ma
terial that is plastic to our hand.
Only man can be helped by man.
"As thou lovest me," Christ said to
Simon Peter, "as thou lovest me.
feed my lambs.*'
W hen they hung John Brown in

Virginia, many said, you remem
ber, that he had thrown away his
life and would gain nothing for it.
"He could not," as Thoreau said at
the time, "get a vote of thanks or a
pair of boots for his life. He could
not get four and-sixpence a day for
I being hung, take the year round."
1 But he was not asking fora vote of
thanks. It was not for the four
and-sixpence that he stood between
brute force and its victims. It was
to show men the nature of slavery.
It was to help his fellow citizens to
| read the story of their institutions
in the light of history. ''You can
get more fora quart of milk," Tho
reau went on to say, "in the market
at Concord than you can fora
quart of blood: but yours i> not the
market heroes carry their blood to."
The blood of heroes is not sold by
the quart. The great, strong, noble,
and pure of the world, those who
have made our race worthy to be
called men, have not been paid by
the day or by the quart, not by
riches nor fame nor power, nor any
thing that man can give. Out of
1 the fullness of their lives have they
i served the Lord. Out of their re
journs have they helped their ft' I -
I low men.
Only those who thus rise above
all matters of rank and fame and
j wages can live in the records of
| man. The great man can not be a
J self-seeker. The greatness of a Na
poleon or an Alexander is the
; greatness of gluttony. It is slavery
on a grand scale. What men have
done for their own glory or aggran
dizement has left no penna nent im
press. "1 have carried out noth
ing"' says the warrior, Sigurd
Slenibe; "I have not sown the least
grain nor laid one stone upon an
other to witness that I have lived."
jA Napoleon could have said as
much, if like Sigurd he could have
stood "upon his own grave and
heard the great bell ring."
What such men have torn down
remains torn down. It would
shortly have fa lien of itself, for that
which is destined to live can never
be torn down by force.
But what such men have built
has fallen when their hands have
ceased to hold it up. The names
history cherishes are men of an
(other type. Only "a man too sim
ply great to scheme for his proper
sell"' is great enough to become a
pi 11 a r of t he ages.
It is part of the duty of higher
education to build up ideals of no
ble freedom. It is not for help in
the vegetative work of life that one
goes to college. lie is just as good
a si a ve without it. He can earn
iiis board and lodging without the
formality of culture. The training
of the college will make his power
for action greater, no doubt, but it
will also magnify bis needs. The
debt of life a scholar lias to pay is
greater than that paid by theelown.
And the higher sacrifice the scholar
may be called upon to make grows
with the increased fullness of his
life, (ireater needs go with greater
power, and both mean greater op
port unities for sacrifice.
In the days you have been with
us, you should have formed some
ideals, you should have bound
these ideals together with thechain
of well spent yesterdays, which is
the first necessity toward making
tlieni real. You should have done
something in the direction of the
life of higher sacrifice, the life that
from the fullnessof its resources can
ha ve soniet liing to give.
The men you meet as you leave
these halls will not understand
these ideals. They will not know
that your life is not bound
up in the present, but has some
thing to ask or to give for the

future. Till they understand you,
tlley will not give you their svmpa
thies. They may jeer at you because
the whip they respond to leaves no
mark upon you. They will trv to
huv you, because the Devil has
always bid high for the lives of
young men with ideals. A man in
his market stands always above
par. Slaves are bis stock in trade.
If a man with power can be had for
base purposes, he can be sure of an
immediate reward. You can sell
your blood for its weight in milk or
for its weight in gold, whichever
you choose —if you are willing to
put it up for sale. You can sell
your will for the kingdoms of the
earth; and you will see or seem to
see many of your associates mak
ing just such bargains. Hut in
this be not deceived. No voting
man worthy of anything else ever
sold himself to the Devil. These
are dummy sales. The Devil puts
his own up at auction in hopes of
catching others. If you fell into
his hands, you had not far to fall.
You were already ripe for his
clutches, " let I bee behind me," is
a command Satan can never choose
but obey.
When a man steps forth from
the college he is tested once for all.
It takes bill a year or two lo prove
his mettle. In the college high
ideals prevail and the intellectual
life is taken as a matter of course.
In the world outside it appears
otherwise, though the conditions of
life are in fact just the same. It is
not true, though it .?eenis so, that
the common life is made up of
"grasping and griping with a u bine
for mercy at the end of it." It is
your own fault if you find it so.
It is not true that the thought of
man is occupied with the effort 'Mo
live just asking but to live." The
world of thought and the world of
action are one in essence. In both
truth is strength, and folly and
selfishness are weakness. There is
no confusion of right and wrong in
the mind of the fates. It is only
in our poor bewildered slave intel
lects that evil passes for power.
All about us in the press of life are
real men. .Men who can not be
bought nor sold, the men in whose
guidance the current of history
Hows.
'The lesson of value in life it
should be yours to teach, because
it should lie yours to know. Men
are better than they seem, and the
hidden virtues of life appear when
men have learned how to translate
them. Men grasp and hoard
material tilings because in their
poverty of soul they know of noth
ing else to do. It is lack of train
ing and lack of imagination rather
than total depravity which gives
our social life its sordid aspect.
When a plant has learned the
secret of flowers and fruit, it no
longer goes on adding meaningless
leaf to leaf. And as "flowers are
only colored leaves, fruit only ripe
ones. ' so are the virtues only per
fected and ripened forms of those
impulses which show themselves as
vices.
It is your relation to the over
flow of power that determines the
manner of man you are. Slave or
god, it is for you to choose. Slave
or god. it is for you to will. It is
for such choice that will is given.
Sav what we may about the limita
tions of th«* life of man, tliev are
largely self limitations. Hemmed
in is human life by the force of the
fates; but the will of man is one of
the fates, and can take it- place by
the side of the rest of them. I he
man who can will is a factor in the
universe. Only the who can will
can serve t he Lord at all, and by I he
same token, hoping for no reward.

Ina recent magazine, the Pinl,
Mr. \Y. P. Ueeves tells us a tale,
half humorous, liulf allegorical, of
the decadence of a scholar. Ac
cording to this story, one Thomson
was a college graduate, full of high
notions of the significance of life
and the duties and privileges of the
scholar. W illi these ideals he went
to (iermany, that he might
strengthen them and use them for
the benefit of his fellowmen. lie
spent some years in (iermany till
ing his mind with all that (ier
iii,'in philosophy could give. Then
he came home to turn his philoso
phy into action. To do this he
sought a college professorship.
This lie found it was not easy to
secure. Nobody cared for him or
his message. The authority of
I "'wise and sober (iermany" was not
recognized in the institutions of
America, and he found that col
lege professorships were no longer
"plums to be picked" by whomso
ever should ask for them. The
! reverence the (iernian professor
commands was unknown in Amer
ica.in (iermany, the authority of
wise men is supreme. Their words,
j when tiicy speak, are heard with
reverence and attention. In Amer
ica wisdom is not wisdom till tie
I common man has examined it and
pronounced it to be such. Ihe
conclusions of the scholar are re
vised by the daily newspaper. The
readers of these papers care little
for messages from I topia. Ihe
theories of the philosopher do not
concern them. No college opened
its door to Thomson, and he saw
.with dismay that the li'e before
him was one of discomfort and
insignificance, his ideals having no
exchangeable value in luxuries or
comforts. Meanwhile Thomson's
early associates seemed to get on
somehow. The world wanted their
cheap achievements, though it did
not care for him.
One of these was one Wilcox,
i and though small in abilities and
poor in virtues, bis infiiience seemed
to be unbounded. The young
woman who had felt an interest
in Thomson's development aml to
whom he had read his rejected ver
ses and his uncalled for philosophy,
had joined herself to the Philistines
and yielded to their influence. She
had become \\ ilcox s wife. II is
friends regarded I honison s failure
as a joke. lle must not take liini
; self too seriously. A man rdiouhl
be in touch with his times. "Kven
Philistia," one said, ''has its tes
t hetic rit ua I and pageant ry." A
wise man man will not despise this
ritual, because Philistinism after
all is the life of the world.
