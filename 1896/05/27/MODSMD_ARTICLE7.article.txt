# "Daily Palo Alto" Statement for Second Semester.
## 
### 
During the month of January of
the present semester the manage
ment of the Daily I'alo Alto
changed. At the end of January
the expenses for the month had ex
ceeded the receipts l»v $40.00. This
defieit was due to the season of the
year more than anything else, it
being exceedingly difficult t<> secure
advertiscments during January and
February. March 1 the January
deficit had been wiped out and a
profit of $2">.ooniwde. In the month
of March the paper's business nearly
doubled, and it has increased stead
ily up to the present time. This
increase has been due in considera
ble part to the fact that the suit
against the Stanford estate had been
won. The victory for the estate
strengthened the confidence of busi
ness men in the growth and con
tinued prosperity of the I niver-i
sity.
The accounts of the paper have
not vet been closed, but the billow
ing will be approximately correct
as a filial statement for the semes
ter, unless there occurs a serious!
loss on the Commencement edition,
the expense of which has been very |
heavy.
