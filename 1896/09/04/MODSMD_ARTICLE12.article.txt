The Freshman is in our midst
again, and thecollege is tlie brighter
for his presence. This year brings
us a large class, and it seems to be
an active and energetic one. It
enters at an auspicious time, for it
will be the first class since the
death of Senator Stanford to find
the University entirely above the
possibility of financial trouble.
We are all fond of the Freshmen,
and we pardon their faults while
we correct them, for we've all been
there, and there's not one of us who
wouldn't give a great deal to live
over a few hours of that bewilder
ingly delightful period — the first
week at college. The Freshman is
indeed welcome in our gates, and
we extend to him the time-worn
annual greeting of the Daily Palo
Alto: "God bless the Freshmen;
they'll be Seniors some day."
