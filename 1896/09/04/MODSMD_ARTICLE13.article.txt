Attention is called to the an
nouncement which appears on
another page of this issue concern
ing the financial condition of the
student body. In the announce
ment in particular a request is
made of each student to come for
ward with his annual assessment
of one dollar as soon as possible.
The reason for this unusual request
is the desire of the football manage
ment to have the new coach arrive
on the ground as soon as his services
can be procured. To enable them
to do this, a certain amount of
money must be raised, and this
money can only be forthcoming
through the annual assessment of
one dollar levied upon each mem
ber of the student body. It is not
expected that all the money raised
will be used in procuring the serv
ices of a coach. There are other
objects just as worthy which must
be pursued, such as meeting the
expenses of the different athletic
a nd musical organizations and pay
ing the debt of sixteen hundred
and fifty dollars, which must be
settled this year. All of these
things are dependent upon the con
dition of the student body treasury, j
and it is easy to see how important
is the request to have each one con
tribute his share to the general
monetary fund.
