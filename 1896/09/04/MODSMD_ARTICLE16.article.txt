A constitution was drafted by a
committee consisting of C. H. Lahhe,

this constitution the following of
ficers were elected on June 25:

The Stanford Club attended in a.
body the athletic games between
the Olympic Athletic Club of San
Francisco and the Multnomah
Amateur Athletic Club of Portland
on June 25. The club occupied
box seats in the grandstand which
were tastefully draped with cardinal
bunting. The two visiting Stan
ford athletes, Brown, '97, and
Brunton, '99, accompanying the
Olympic team, were made honorary
members of the club and were en
couraged in their efforts on the
track by the Stanford yell and fre
quent cheers.
Brown succumbed to Tallant of
the M. A. A. C. in the half and the
mile in two very exciting finishes.
The mile was run in 4 min. 81 1-5
sec.; the half in 2 min. 4-5 sec.
Brunton took second in the broad
jump with 20 feet 5 inches; first in
the 220-yard dash in 23 1-5 sec
onds, establishing a new record for
the Pacific Northwest; but he lost
the 440-yard run.
The first annual banquet of the
club was given Saturday evening,
August 29, at one of the leading
restaurants in Portland. The
affair was most enjoyable. The
banqueting room was tastefully
decorated in cardinal, and the
table was adorned with cardinal
carnations and sweet peas. The
menu was most delectable, and be
tween courses the college songs
were sung. Thomas Pomeroy, '95,
