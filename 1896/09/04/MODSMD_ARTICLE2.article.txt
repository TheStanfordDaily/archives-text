# New Buildings on the Campus.
## 
### 
When college closed in June it
was generally understood that some
building for the University was to
be done on the campus during the
summer, particularly in the nature
of a large auditorium and lecture
hall; but a look around fails to dis
close any signs of such a building
in course of construction, and a talk
with Mr. Hodges elicits the infor
mation that nothing in that line
will be attempted, at least this se
mester.
Several private parties had in
tended putting uj) dwellings and
boarding-houses, but now all plans
appear to be in statu quo until the
election shall have been decided in
November. About the only build
ing that will be attempted this se
mester will be a $6,000 house for
Delta Upsilon fraternity. The
plans for the house were drawn by
Prof. Clark of the department of
Architecture of the University.
It will be located, in all probability,
on Salvatierra street near Mari
posa Hall, and will be ready for oc
cupancy by Christmas.
