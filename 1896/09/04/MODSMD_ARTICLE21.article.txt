Died, on July, 9, at Ashland,
Oregon, Alfred Cookman Mont
gomery, aged twenty-one years.
During the vacation just ended
the Class of '97 has suffered another
serious loss. Alfred Cookman Mont
gomery was hoth physically and
intellectually one of the best and
strongest men in our college He
was a student of intense applica
tion, and was gifted with a mind of
unusual alertness and clearness,
mature beyond his years. These
mental qualities enabled him, at
the expense of hut little time, to
make a brilliant record in his regu
lar recitation work, and left him
the greater part of each day to
spend aB he would. As he was
naturally of an inquiring disposi
tion, his spare hours were daily
spent along his chosen line of
work —ancient history. This he
pursued with a devotion that was
the probable cause of a nervous
break-down that overtook him at
the end of the last academic year.
His illness soon culminatnd in
brain-fever, and on the ninth day
of July he died, twenty-one years
of age.
The brilliance of his intellect at
tracted everyone and the sweetness
of his character endeared him to all
who knew him well; and all that,
with the circumstances of his death,
makes his loss one of the saddest
that has befallen our student corps.
