To the Student Body:
The Associated Students lev}'
upon each student an annual as
sessment of $1.00. The fund thus
raised is used, in part, to help de
fray the current expenses of foot
ball, baseball, track' athletics,
women's athletics, and musical or
ganizations; and, in part, to pay off
old debts, which it has not yet
been possible altogether to liqui
date. A $1,650 debt now stands
against the association. This debt
must be paid during the college
year 1896-97.
No money is at present available
to get the football team in condi
tion for the Thanksgiving game;
therefore every student is urged to
pay his assessment now. No fur
ther levy will be made during the
year. Horace Pomeroy, Pres.
F. W. Morrison, Treas.
