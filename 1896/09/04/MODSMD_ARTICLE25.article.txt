# Berkeley Letter.

Editor Palo Alto: It may seem
a little out of the way at this late
hour to write of the class of 1900,
yet to send you my first letter with
no mention of the new-comers,
would be to neglect the lending
things which have concerned us for
the last two weeks. 1900 came,
and saw, and conquered. And now
they walk around with their heads
at an angle of 30°, not having
learned, of course, that only the
meek inherit the campus But be
it said for the men themselves, that
not since '97 entered, have 250
freshmen shown such promise phys
ically, as those who, lining upon
the campus a week from last Tues
day, struggled bravely, till every
last sophomore gasped " '99'' in the
direction of the Southern Cross.
So that taking it all in all, we hope
fora great deal from 1900.
Just one incident I must relate
(though this is on the«ly). It was
the morning when the President
met the incoming class in Stiles
Hall. A band of sophomores were
around the steps making life pecu
liarly disagreeable for the new men,

till freshman spirit could stand it
no longer, and a brisk hand to hand
tussel ensued. Two strapping fel
lows from up country seized upon
a likely victim, about their own
age, and spared no pains to make
things uncomfortable. Hut alas!
freshman pride was lowered when
that same individual called the roll
in class the next day.
Our faculty has been increased
by the coming of Dr. Fryer, from
Shanghai, and Dr. Babcock, from
Harvard. Dr. Fryer takes tlie Ag
assiz chair of Oriental languages
and literature, while Dr. Babcock
is instructor in history.
This new department of Chinese
is attracting quite a little interest,
or, better perhaps, curiosity. Classes
have not been started as yet; the
applications for the course number
about ten or twelve.
The Republicans formed a club
some days ago with J. M. Oliver,
'98, as president. Success is as
sured by the very numbers, for
over l« r >o have signed the roll. A
week from next Tuesday Judge
Carpenter, of San Francisco, and
other prominent Republicans will
address the student body under the
auspices of the club.
The Democrats have likewise or
ganized, with J. W. Leggett, '98, as
president. In numbers, however,
they have not been so fortunate as
their rivals.
Our athletes are just beginning
to put in an appearance on the
track, but training is not fully un
der way. Captain Ransoine an
nounces .Sept. 15 as commencement
of the football season. We have se
cured Butterworth as our coach
again, and expect him to arrive
about Oct. 1.
As its basis of study for this term
the Philosophical Union will read
a work on Hegel's Logic, by Hon.
W. T. Harris, U. S. Minister of
Education. Dr. Harris has accepted
an invitation to visit the union
early in December, and he will then
read a paper in defence of his views.
