# Cross to be Our Coach.
## 
### 
Upon the recommendation of
Walter Camp, 11. P. Cross, center
of last year's Yale team, has been
engaged as coach by this year's
management. Camp recommended
Mr. Cross on tne grounds of his
heady play, his ability to manage a
team, his long experience, and his
thorough knowledge of the game.
Mr. Cross entered Yale with the
class of '96, having already had
several years experience on the
gridiron. He played on his class
team throughout his course, and
was kept off the center position of
the varsity only by the presence of
the famous Stillman. As it was,
Cross was always a strong candi
date for the position, and was con
sidered Stillman's equal by many
competent judges of the game.
Upon Stillman's graduation,
Cross took his place on the varsity
team, and was considered second
only to Bull among last year's cen
ters.
Mr. Cross is also well known as a
hammer thrower, having repre
sented Yale in her contests with
Oxford and Cambridge, in both of
which he took second place. His
record in this event is 135 feet. Mr.
Cross is six feet three inches in
height, weighs 215 pounds, and is
exceptionally active fora man of
his weight.
Mr. Cross will arrive Sept. 20
and will take charge of the practice
at once.
