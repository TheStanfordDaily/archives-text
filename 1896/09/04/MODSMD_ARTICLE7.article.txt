# Football Prospects.
## 
### 
The University has opened, and
football is, as usual, the all-absorb
ing topic round the campus. Bar
ring those who graduated with '96,
the old men are all back. The sit
uation this year is peculiar: our
line of last year is practically in
tact, but we have all the places
back of the line to fill, with the ex
ception of one half-back. Quarter
back and full-back are especially
problematical.
Although Fickert has not thor
oughly canvassed the freshman
class for new material he is very
much encouraged by the favorable
reports of good men in 1900. The
only men of the freshman class
whose coming has been much her
alded are Murphy, the quarter
back of Salem University, lluss of
Portland, and Madden of San Fran
cisco. Murphy has a good record,
and his abilities as a player are
well known, Russ is an old foot
ball man. His last playing was
done on the Multnomah Athletic
Club of Portland, Oregon. The
freshman class has quite a number
of large husky-looking men who
are likely to amount to something
on the football field, but the records
of those men mentioned above are
the only ones which seem to be gen
erally known.
The old men who have been seen
on the quad are: Captain Fickert,
guard; Williams, center: Carle,
guard; Cotton, end; Jeffs, end;
Dole, half; Fisher, half; Freeman,
full-back; McKintosh, quarter;
Soper, full-back; Rice, tackle;
Thomas, tacnle; Thomas, half;
Holbrook, quarter. Soper has
been practicing a great deal this
summer and is in fine form for
punting. He has still, however, to
learn to tackle.

It will be a surprise to many to
hear that Captain Fickert may try
his hand at tackle this year. There
are so many good men for the
heavy positions that the captain
thinks it best to play in the lighter
place if possible and give the nu
merous good candidates for center
and guard an opportunity to play
in the positions for which they are
best fitted. Wilbur, Williams, and
Carle in the center with Fickert
and one of the old men at tackle
would make a strong combination.
Nothing will be done for some
time as to training, but Captain
Fickert will call meetings of the
men early next week to formulate
plans. Light exercise in running
will be given in a week or two.
The distance of the runs will be
gradually lengthened until the men
have good wind and staying quali
ties, when regular practice will be
gin.
At the University of California
conditions are reversed. They can
depend upon their backs, but the
line is very much broken, and the
material for forward positions is
quite uncertain. The first call for
candidates brought forth a good
number of husky freshmen, but
their football abilities are an un
known quantity. Back of the line,
quarter is the only vacant position,
and there are several promising
candidates for that place.
