# FAITH.
## Sunday's Sermon by Dr. Thoburn. 
### 
Yesterday l)r.Thoburn opened the
chapel exercises for the year by an
interesting and thoughtful sermon
on ''Faith." Special music was
rendered by Mrs. Smith, Mr. Ab
bott, and a picked choir. Dr. Tho
burn spoke in brief as follows:
Faith is a perfectly real thing, as
real as religion, and 1 wish to show
how real a factor it is in religious
life. Many even who have no faith
in God will understand what 1
mean by faith in self, and from
faith in self they can understand
faith in God.
Religion is near us now at the
beginning of college. We are full
of dreams and plans, and religion
is in them all. Your plans may
center on yourself, on others, on
the world at large, on God; still
God is in it all. To me our college
life the past week has been full
of (iod. Where one has been
planning for himself ;rtid pulling
wires, twenty have been, plan
ning for others, and God has
shown through all their plans.
The one thing I wish you to recog
nize in all your college work is the
fathership of God until you can see
that when you do well you are do
ing as God does. No man ever did
anything well until lie recognized,
in spirit, the fathership of God.
There is another thing in calling
God father; it is the idea of family
feeling. When 1 see a student tak
ing an interest in other students 1
feel that be is growing up. There
is a natural esprit <lc corps among
men and women who work side by
side. Now there is another feeling
of fellowship, the fellowship of the
race; the feeling of a man that all
the sons of God are his brothers.
Emerson says that a man bears
beliefs as a tree bears fruit. Jt is
as unreasonable to expect that a
poor tree can bear good fruit as
that a half-hearted man can have
strong beliefs. It is an old idea
that a man must be a broken and
empty vessel before the grace of
(iod can enter his soul. No broken
vessel ever held anything valuable.
Much of the fear and distrust and
cowardice in our hearts is"due to
our own weaknesses. We know
that God will do well; it is we who
do ill.
Faith does not depend upon our
belief that our selfish prayers will
be answered. Heaven is full of
blessings, and we must take them.
They are waiting for great, strong
arms to tai<e them away, but puny,
untrained arms can not bear them
away. We need stalwarts in re
ligion; we need them right here in
our University halls.
There are two ideas of faith.
The lirst is that faith is born with
us, and that if it doesn't come it is
God's fault. We are told to pray
for the faith of a little child. Now
the faith of a little child conies only
with second childhood. Real faith
comes for strong men to live by.
Much of this so-called faith is inex
perience. Contrast this faith with
the faith of David who, at the end
of his long, stormy life, wrote the
twenty-third psalm. ''Surely good
ness and mercy will follow me all
the days of my life." Real faith,
faith that binds (iod to man, must

be won by constant exercise. I
wish I could make each one of you
feel that he holds the key to his
own heaven.
Life is a period of test. We all
have been put to the test; we have
put God to the test, lie has never
failed us. When we have been
right we have never failed. When
we have failed it is because we have
allowed our faith in God to be
shaken. Our belief, our faith, is
the evidence of the tilings we hope
to come to pass. But some will ob
ject: '"This puts my religious life
in my own hands." That is where
it belongs. We are too willing to
put our religious lives in the hands
of the Almighty. We are are not
pensioners but heirs; let us be, like
true sons, co-workers.
One closing word. All of us are
here today as new students. It is
a peculiarity of Stanford that here
professor and freshman, president
and housekeeper are all students.
Let us begin today to be students of
our Heavenly Father. Let us fit
ourselves l.ke men to find out these
unseen things, knowing God will
never fail us if we are true to God
in ourselves.
