We begin this football season
with very good prospects. The
coach comes with the endorsement
of our old favorite, Walter Camp,
and we have no reason to doubt his
ability. Great things are expected
of our captain; and thanks to the
foreseeing policy of Walter Camp,
we have available second team ma
terial for almost all Varsity vacan
cies. Enthusiastic support by the
students is all that is wanting to a
combination that shall wipe out
that tie and make this another car
dinal vear.
