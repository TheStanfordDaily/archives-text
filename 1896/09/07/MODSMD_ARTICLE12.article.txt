Notice is made in the last issue of
the deaths of two Stanford students
during the summer months, the
one shortly after college closed, the
other just before the commence
ment of work again. Both deaths
were almost entirely unexpected
and the news came like a crushing
blow to their many friends. Mr.
Montgomery was about to enter
upon his senior year; Mr. Jack
upon his sophomore. Each was a
man of worth and character, a
credit to the University to which
he belonged, and his loss from our
circles will be sincerely felt by all*
The Daily Palo Alto extends the
condolences of the University to
sorrowing friends and relatives.
