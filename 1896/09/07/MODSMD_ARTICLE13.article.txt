During the past few days several
acts have taken place which in
dicate an excessive exuberance of
class spirit among the Sophomores.
The University has ever been noted
for its absence of hazing except in
a very mild and gentle form, and
everyone, whether upper-classman
or undergraduate, should discoun
tenance any attempt to introduce
the custom in vogue at other col
leges of hazing freshmen. Hazing
is entirely at variance with the
spirit of this institution and the
traditions of the student body, and
the present Sophomore class should
be the last to institute a custom of
this nature. The annual rush, if
it takes place, is sufficient to test
I he class spirit of any ardent Sopho
more, without his disgracing him
self and his class by descending to
the level of sundry acts committed
in Encina this week. Any Fresh
man-Sophomore contest which goes
beyond pure fun lowers the standard
and dignity of the University.
