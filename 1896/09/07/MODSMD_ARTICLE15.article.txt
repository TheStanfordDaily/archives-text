# "Josh's" New Departure.
## 
### 
Joah, formerly conducted by grad
uates of the University of Cali
fornia, lias become an intercolle
giate bi-weekly. Beginning with
the issue of August 15 it appears
as a magazine "for the university
men of the Pacitic Coast," with
Berkeley and Stanford depart
ments and with several pages of
general matter of interest to college
men. Musical and dramatic af
fairs are given especial attention.
C. K. Field, '95, will have charge of
the Stanford department, while
Donald Fry, '91), and Culver, '97,
will represent us in art-
Judging from the first number,
Jotth's new departure is a success.
The articles and jokes are clever,
and the drawings, for the most
part, excellent. One full-page
drawing by Quinan, "The Old
Problem," is, in conception and ex
ecution, far above the average of
professional work. The cover is
one of Swinnerton's clever little
conceits and is striking and at
tractive.
Taken all in all, Joxh compares
very favorably with the Record, the
Lampoon, and the other college
publications of its class, and we
predict for it a long life of mirth
and levity. Incidentally it might
be mentioned that JoÂ»h invites con
tributions from all college humor
ists, amateur and otherwise.
