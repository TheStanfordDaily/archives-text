## They Effect a Temporary Organization. 
### 
The Freshman Class met in the
chapel this afternoon at 2 o'clock.
It was a small but enthusiastic
meeting, and revealed the existence
of several embryo orators whose
infantile genius lacks only univer
sity polish.
The class was called to order by
Cotton, president of the Junior
Class. Healy was unanimously
chosen temporary chairman and
Frank Hunt temporary secretary.
The following committees were ap
pointed by lle.ily:
Constitution: B. Kinney, chair
man, Chandler, E. Dawson.
Class yell: Irwin, chairman, Mur
phy, Frank Adams.
Class colors: Miss Delinger,
chairman, Miss Adams, Frazier.
Annual rush: Gus Madern,chair
man, Murphy, Kinney.
A vote of thanks was extended to
the Junior Class and especially to
their president for courtesies ex
tended to the freshmen.
A committee of six from the
Sophomore Class, headed by Rollie
Wilbur, were present to confer with
the committee from the freshmen in
regard to the Annual Rush. After
a short conference the committee
reported. No definite action was
reached, as the committeemen from
the two classes could not agree
upon a time. Many of the fresh
men were in favor of waiting two
weeks, but such action was deemed
inadvisable. In all probability the
rush will take place tomorrow af
ternoon, as the freshmen have been
advised to open hostilities at that
time.
The meeting was poorly attended
owing to the fact that it was not
sufficiently advertised.
