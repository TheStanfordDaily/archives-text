# Apropos of the Election.

### 
The coming presidential election
is viewed with a great deal of in
terest by the students of the Uni
versity. The courses in money and
credit last year excited more than a
passing interest in the question
which has since become the vital
issue of this campaign.
The Republican Club is an active
organization of almost three hun
dred members. It is proposed to
form a marching corps within the
club. The officers of the club have
made arrangements to secure the
services of several prominent Re
publican orators, and they are
planning to hold a mass-meeting at
an early date.
The Democrats organized last
spring before the money question
had been revealed as the vital issue
of the campaign, and, as there were
few free-traders in the University,
the membership was not large.
The free-silver plank in the Demo
cratic platform has greatly swelled
their ranks. B. L. Mills, the pres
ident of the club, has graduated,
and nothing definite can be done
until a new leader is elected.
