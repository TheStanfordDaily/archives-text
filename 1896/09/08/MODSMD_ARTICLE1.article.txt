# 1900 VICTORIOUS.
## The 						Infant Class Wins the Rush. 
### 
The century class has come,
seen, and conquered, and the soph
omores, in consequence, enjoyed a
free ride to Redwood City this after
noon. It was a short, exciting
rush, the best, according to the
older men, that has occurred since
the days of the famous contests be
tween '95 and '96.
There were rumors of rushes all
day yesterday. The sophomores
had declared officially through
their rush committee that they
would rush last night or not at all.
The freshmen, by the advice of the
juniors, remained in their rooms,
however, while the sophomores, to
the number of seventy or eighty,
spent the evening in decorating the
backstop.
It was pretty generally under
stood that the contest would come
off this afternoon. Directly after
lunch the two factions began to
gather in and around Encina. The
sophomores, after a short confer
ence, started off in tiie direction of
the museum, and began tying up
freshmen as they came up from
Palo Alto. About a dozen were
caught in this way, and carted off
to Redwood City in the traditional
manner.
Meanwhile the freshmen, uncon
scious of the tactics of the opposi
tion, were quietly gathering at En
cina. Some juniors on bicycles
brought up tiie news to Encina,
and the infant class promptly
moved on the foe. The two classes
met with a crash and the tight com
menced
The sides were well matched in
size and number, there being about
eighty freshmen and seventy soph
omores. Both sides, under the di
rection of the upper - classmen,
fought fiercely and well fora half
hour, when the tide of the battle
turned in favor of the century class,
and within three quarters of an
hour after the first charge the
sophomores were being carted off in
a convenient hay-wagon.
Almost the whole University was
present, and the bright summer
dresses of the co-eds showed in
marked contrast to the tatiered,
dirty figures who lay in heaps on
the ground. Some of the young
women adopted Berkeley tactics in
attempting to cut loose their class
mates. Fortunately there was little
of this, and it was soon stopped.
