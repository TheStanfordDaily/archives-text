The attention of sill musicians is
called to the fact that there is
greater need of a good band at Stan
ford this year than ever before.
Berkeley has a first-class organiza
tion, and, we understand, intends
challenging us to a contest on
Thanksgiving day. Besides, this
is a campaign year, and the need
of a band to assist the political
clubs in their demonstrations is
imperative. What the Class of
15)00 brings with it in the way of
musical ability remains to be seen.
But if at the meeting which is
called, all new as well as old
band men will attend and work
energetically for success, we will
have such an organization this fall
as in past years has made our Uni
versity famous.
