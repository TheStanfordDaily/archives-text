One thing that is noticeable
about this year's incoming class is
the large number of its members
who have come from eastern states.
It is perhaps safe to say that no
previous class in the University has
drawn so largely upon the states
east of the Rocky Mountains. The
reason for this is apparent. Since
its foundation Stanford has en
joyed an enviable reputation
among the college-going world,
and from no part of the country
has the demand for informa
tion regarding the University
and its courses of study come
with such volume as from the East
itself. Hut the cloud that hovered
over us, threatening the future of
the University, deterred many from
coining and sent to eastern colleges
much material that might rightly
have come to us. With the lifting
of this cloud and with the assur

lance that the University will con
tinue, there is setting in a counter
current that will bring to us not
only the bright young men and
women of California but those from
the East as well.
