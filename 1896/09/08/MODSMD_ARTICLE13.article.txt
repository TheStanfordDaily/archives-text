The political situation at Stan
ford is at present the subject of
much comment. Even a cursory
observer of student interests is
greatly impressed with the atten
tion given to politics by Stanford
men.
College politics under the present
conditions of organization is a crea
tion of the campaign of '5)6. It is
well for college men, who have
strong convictions on political is
sues, to be represented and recog
nized in national affairs. More es
pecially is it desirable that college
voters, who are not yet in practical
life but who are eminently quali
fied to use the influence they may
derive from university clubs, should
have every possible advantage.
Much good can be done with proper
work, and all efforts for student
organization at Stanford should be
encouraged.
The course in Practical Politics
by Prof. Powers will deal with pres
ent political issues, and should be
given attention by all who wish to
vote intelligently, or to be well in
formed on campaign matters.
