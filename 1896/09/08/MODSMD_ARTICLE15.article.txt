Those who were members of tlie
Choral Society hint year will need
no urging to keep up their connec
tion with the society, but many
new students, and perhaps some old
ones, will be interested in a state
ment of what the Chorus is, and
what it has done.
The Chorus was organized only
last semester, and astonished
those who followed its course
by giving in May the best con
cert yet heard at the University.
With only about a hundred and
fifty members, many of whom knew
not a note of music when they en
tered, the society rendered, with in
spiring effect, the " Hallelujah
Chorus," and the "Heavens are
Telling," as well as, with delicacy
and true feeling, such works as
Mendelssohn's •' Farewell to the
Forest" and"He Watching Over
Israel."
But it is not the external success
of the Chorus which gives it the
first claim to consideration. If
brought to light the latent musical
spirit of the University, and it af
forded its members a training and
a delight which they will never lose.
Membership in a chorus provides
the quickest and easiest means of
learning to read and understand
music, and the most efficient method
of correcting uncertain musical per
ceptions. Above all, the study of
great musical works is an enlarge
ment of the spirit. In this era of
specialization not a few students
overlook the fact that a man with
out sympathy and reverence for the
nol-le and beautiful in art and life
may deserve (he praise due a skilled
mechanic, but can never claim
the honor of being an educated
man. Our system of education,
often confined to the training of the
intellect in soundness of judgment
and facility and accuracy of work
ing, leaves us without the power of
self-expression —often without gen
erous and noble enthusiasms. Sing
ing helps to balance both the undue
introspection of the scholar and the
undue materialism of the ''practical
man." It affords a beautiful and
dignified relaxation, and a tonic in
spi ration.
To freshmen especially member
ship in a large class offers an op-1
port unity not lightly to be neg-1
lee ted. Four years spent in gaining
familiarity with great choral works i
constitutes in a way a liberal edu-!
cation in music; and the rehearsals)
of the Chorus will constitute for its|
members among the most abiding
and delightful of the memories they !
take with them from the Univer-i
sity.
The conditions of membership)
are the ability to sing in tune with I
others, and a not disagreeable!
voice. No technical understanding j
of music is required. Very few |
people are so devoid of musical per-:
eeptions and so unfortunate in
their vocal organs as to fall below!
these requirements. Any one who j
is doubtful as to hi-* Htness can
have his doubts removed by con
sulting Mr. Pasmore, who will be in
the chapel from 1 to 4:80 Thursday j
afternoon to try voices.
All interested, whether they ex-1
pect to join or not, are invited to
be present at the lirst meeting on i
Wednesday evening at 7:80 in the!
chapel. H. B. Lathuop,
Vice-President Choral Society.
