For the benefit of players and
others musically inclined, we have
been asked to furnish some infor
mation concerning the Stanford
hand. Tins branch <>112 the Univer
sity musical organizations origi
nated in the fall of 1892, when a
few enthusiasts organized with A.
(J. Kaufman as leader. It was not
a success, however, owing to lack of
support among the students. The
following year the short lived de
partment of Military Tactics was
thriving in the University, and the
hand was placed under control of
the Military department with one
hour's University credit for regular
attendance at two practices a week.
Kaufman was the leader, and this
year the hand attained a proficiency
which it has never surpassed. It

numbered forty members and made
a decided "hit" at the Thanksgiving
game.
The fall of '94 was another suc
cessful year. Kaufman led again
and several expert players entered
with the freshman class. There
was no University credit given this
year, but nevertheless they mus
tered up fifty strong, and were the
pride and joy of the Stanford dele
gation at tiie football game. Their
playing was favorably noticed on
all sides and they put up a natty
appearance in their neat black and
white uniforms. Timtn, '95, was
drum major.
Last year band stock was decid
edly low. They did not organize
until late in the season,and almost
all the best players bad left college
the previous year. Then Kaufman,
the old leader, was unable to take
his former position. Nevertheless
thirty men got together some six
weeks before Thanksgiving and at
tained a fair degree of proticiency
before the big game. Great credit
is due Van Norden, '9(i, and
McChesney, '9<S, who acted as
leader and drum major respectively.
This year is the critical period
with the band. Many of the old
players are back in the University,
but they are not enough to make a
successful organization. It is there
fore earnestly requested that all
men who have any skill in that di
rection will come forward for places
on the band.
