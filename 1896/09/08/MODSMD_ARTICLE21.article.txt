Editor I'aloAi/to: Vou probably
know that last year we were fortu
nate enough to have the library
building turnished with electric
light sho that it could I>e used at
night time. For several months
the library was kept open from
seven until ten, and, although only
a few went, it was, nevertheless,
much appreciated. At the begin
ing of this term we were in doubt
as to whether the lighting would be
continued or not. It depended up
on the necessary appropriation.
But now we know that it will be
impossible, for the appropriation
made by the Regents is hardly
enough to pay one-half the salary
of a man to run the electric system
at night. So that not only will the
1 ibrary have to be closed as hereto
fore, but something we regret even
more, the campus will be left in
darkness, as the arc lights are sup
plied with current from the univer
sity system.
in my last letter I wrote you a
little about the freshman. Class
spirit was not ended by the rush of
two weeks ago. Last Thursday
some '"Nothing"' men painted the
backstop with "11)00." Saturday
morning, however, a band of soph
omores replaced the "11)00" with a
big " '99." They guarded their
num.>er until half-past twelve, en
countering no opposition. A group
of the new men did gather around
Stiles Hall, but a timely display
of sophomore strength caused the
said group to disperse in a very in
formal way. Hut the "Nothings,"!
refusing to acknowledge this as <le- j
feat, gathered together yesterday
morning and, having effaced the j
mark of the sophs, replaced it with i
a big "DO" on a green background.
Thus the matter stands now, for
the new men stood their ground in j
the rush yesterday. Now they'
will probably give the backstop a|
good coating and put up the < 'U.C/ I
which will end the whole affair.
The Associated Students met last j
Friday afternoon ami discussed the!
question of athletics. The meeting!
resolved itself into the Athletic As-1
sociation and proceeded with lutm-1
inations for track manager. C. R.
Morse, post-graduate; Samuel A.!
Word, 'IKS; and 1». 1\ Miller, '97, j
were nominated. Voting will takej
place by ballot sometime during
the week. Bkrkkleyan.
