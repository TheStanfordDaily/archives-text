# THE 						FIRST GUN.
## Republicans Open the Campaign 
### 
In spite of last night's rushes
and rumors of rushes a good-sized J
crowd turned out to the Republican j
Clul) meeting. W hat the crowd
lacked in size it made up in enthu
siasm. Indeed, if last night's af
fair can betaken as a sample, '.he
"campaign of education" is going
to mingle considerable noise with
its general information. Every
speaker was greeted with cheers, i
and many of them were interrupted
by riotous applause. Between j
speeches there were rousing cheers
for McKinley and Hobart.
The speakers and their remarks
were about as follows:
Switzer,'9B, as president of the j
organization, opened the meeting
with a review of last year's work j
and a summary of political events
during the summer. Me showed
that silver coinage was the issue of
this campaign, and congratulated
the club upon the number of former j
opponents who had acceded to tbe
Republican rani<s as a result of the
stand of the Democratic party, and
he closed by urging upon all stu- i
dents the necessity of close study of |
the money question.
Sheldon, after speaking of
the change in his politic.il views
brought about by the events* <>112 the
summer, assailed many of the j
Democratic arguments, lie hi- >ved
that an American''financial declar
ation of independence" is ii,i|*>s
sible until the United !-'tul<s be
comes a nation entirely isolated.
The speaker dwelt at some length
on the prominent Democrats who!
had acceded to the Republican!
ranks on the strength of the money \
question, and strongly deprecated '
any attempt to set the "masses |
against the classes." He endedl
with an appeal to University men
to support McKinley. Mr. Sheldon |
gave the most logical speech of the j
evening, and his remarks were fre-!
quently interrupted by applause.
Lake, '97, speaking as a New
York man, assured his hearers that
New York was no longer a doubtful
state, and that Bryan had greatly
injured the Democratic cause in
that state by bis attempts to stir
up class rivalry. He ended by i
assailing the records of the promi- j
nent free silver advocates.
Kennedy, '00, delivered a glowing
eulogy on the character and record
of McKinley.
Ross, indulged in some pleas-j
antries at the expense of Bryan, j
He urged a non-partisan stand
point on the issue, which heeharac-!
terized as the greatest since the war.!
He showed the disparity between I
the arguments used by Bryan in j
the East and those which he had
used in the West. From this he j
argued Bryan's insincerity. He:
said that the Sherman law was an j
experiment which had proven the
fallacy of the silver theories. He
urged the audience to remember
that silver was not the only issue
of the Campaign.
At the conclusion of the regular j
program, Zion, '94, was called upon
by the audience to state the Demo-!
cratic side of the question. Mr.
Zion told a clever story at the ex-!
pense of the Republican audience.'
and answered several arguments of

his opponentn. He pointed out the
fallacy of several arguments used
on both sides of this campaign, and
urged upon University men the ne
cessity of taking an interest in
national polities.
J. H. Timmons was elected mem
ber of the executive committee, and
•J. M. Ross treasurer, to lill va
cancies.
After jidjournment all present
were invited to sign the club con
stitution, and over a hundred
names were enrolled.
