# OUR NEW MEN.
## What We May Expect From the Freshman Class. 
### 
Sufficient prowess has already
been demonstrated by some of the
brawny men of the freshman class
to justify the managers in looking
to them for material with which
to rehabilitate our Varsity team.
The graduation of the (.'lass of '9fi
took from us some of our best and
most reliable men. Consequently
our dependence upon the new set
of men is very great.
Among the men who have come
to us are many whose acquaint
ance with the football field needs
not to be made. There are many
who have played in athletic clubs
and some in intercollegiate con
tests. Some of the most promising
of these are here given.
Ballentine comes from Portland
University, where he played guard;
he was in the team that opposed
the Butte team and more than held
his own against the redoubtable
Hooper of Michigan. He weighs
only Kil), which will perhaps in
duce him to play end here. His
speed is good and he had a record
of ten feet in the pole vault.
Rusk is also from Portland Uni
versity and was also in the team
which played Butte last New
Year's day. His weight is 1 (50, and
he plays left tackle, for which pos
ition he expects to try here. He
has a good record as a half-mile
runner.
Lanegan played fullback for the
Denver High School and will make
a try for that position here. He
weighs 165-and shows good promise.
Murphy of Willamette Univer
sity is an all-round athlete. As a
hurdler, baseballist, bicyclist, and
football player he distinguished
himself during his stay in Willam
ette and in the State University of
Oregon. His hest work is done as
quarterback and his playing is
characterized by coolness, sure pass
ing of the ball, and remarkable
head work whenever the game ap
proaches a crisis. His tackling is
up to the average.

Normal School, but formerly
played on the team of the Stockton
Athletic Club. He has played in
every position but center and ex

Tacoma High School but expects!
to trv for end here. He weighs 14S. 1
Madden played left end on the
Olympic team last year and went
with the team on its northern trip
