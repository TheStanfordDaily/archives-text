That the present freshman class
has a proper conception of student
duty and university spirit has been
shown in all their manly actions
since their introduction to Stanford
life. The Class of 15)00 is to he
congratulated on its proper use of
the broad Stanford system of toler
ation. The freshmen won a repu
tation for gallantry in their treat
ment of their unfortunate opponents
in the rush and their scrupulous
observance of the faculty request
that no tanks or other property be
disfigured,calls for complimentary
notice. The century class should
keep up their record by refraining
from scratching or mutilating class
room property as has been done
heretofore.
