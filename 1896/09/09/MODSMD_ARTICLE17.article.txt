### 
Quite a large party left Stanford
about July first hy rail to Sanger
Junction, fifteen miles southeast of
Fresno. From this point they went
forty-five miles by stage to .Sequoia
.Mills where pack animals were ob
tained for the ladies. In this man
ner some fifty more miles were tra
versed. The party was composed
of the following: C. N. Little and
family, J. M. Stillman and family,
G. M. Richardson and family, V. L.
Kellogg and Dr. Wood of Stanford
and Chancellor Snow and Prof.
Franklin of the University of Kan
sas.
The party were out six weeks,
and report an exceedingly pleasant
trip. A short stop was made at
the General Grant National Park,
where a member of our party meas
ured one of the big trees. It was
found to Ite 116 feet in circumfer
ence. Incidentally it is mentioned
that twenty-three rattlesnakes lost
their lives. While in the Kings
River country they met Prof. B. C.
Brown and wife and also I). W.
Murphy.
Certainly one of the most pic
turesque trips of the summer was
that of Prof. W. H. Hudson and
family to Alaska, the land of gold
and ghicier. After leaving Van
couver the variety of shore line and
its nearness render it an object of
absorbing interest to the tourist.
The green terraces of forest are bro
ken here and there by rocky bluffs,
covered with moss and lichen; min
iature cascades pour tiny silver
threads down their sides. The
main feature of the trip is the gla
ciers beyond Juneau, the most
beautiful being the Great Mirror
Glacier.

principal part of the vacation in
the East. Professors Barnes, Ross,

of Chicago. Prof. M. S. Barnes
