# Changes in the Football Rules.
## 
### 
The football rules for 18W> are (lie
outcome of the season of factional
strife of 189f>. Those who are fami
liar with the unfortunate circum
stances which led to the adoption
of two sets of rules to govern the
games between different colleges
last year, know that the sport was
in a fair way to he broken up en
tirely if something was not done to
heal the breach between the oppos
ing parties. United action was
therefore brought about by the
University Athletic Club in March
of this year, with the result that a
meeting of the representatives of
the various colleges was called to
devise a uniform code and one which
would be satisfactory to all con
cerned. The committee was com
posed of ine following well-known
exponents of the game: J. 11. Sears
of Harvard; .John (J. He 11 of the
University of Pennsylvania; Alex
Moffat of Princeton; Prof. L. M.
Dennis of Cornell; Paul •). Dashiell
of Annapolis; and Walter Camp of
Vale. Upon the occasion of their
first meeting Mr. Camp was unani
mously chosen chairman and sec
retary of I he committee. The meet
ings were all most harmonious and
the rules, which were adopted by a
unanimous vote, were submitted to
the University Athletic Club, which
through its executive committee
approved the action of the rules
committee.
The most concise and forcible
summing up of the changes brought
about by the new rules is contained
in Spalding's "Official Football
Guide" for 189(>, which says:
'' The principal changes, outside
of mere alterations in the wording,
were made in the rules governing
fair catch and scrimmage. The
former has, after a season of trial,
been brought back to its old
ruling of heeling a catch, but the
penalty of two years ago, viz., fif
teen yards, which was attached at
the time when the law was made
providing for holding up the hand,
has been retained. The situation
then is the same as three years ago,
save that the catcher is protected
by a very severe penalty against in
terference or being thrown. ft is
highly improbable that there will
be any infringement of this rule in
the face of a loss of fifteen j'ards.
"In a scrimmage the feeling!
against too great concentration of;
plays has shown itself, and mo-1
nientum plays are practically elim-j
inated and mass plays held in j
cheek in two ways. Hiding that;
no player shall take more than a!
single step before the ball is put in
play, save one man who may be in
motion toward his own goal, will j
bar out all forms of momentum i
play, much to the satisfaction of j
most players and spectators. The j
rule forbidding five men to bunch ;
inside of tackles will help to hold
back mass plays, although by no
means eliminating them. It is to]
be hoped that the good judgment j
of captains and coaches can be re- ;
lied upon to see that there is fully
as much to be gained in open play j
as in the concentrated push-work.
" There are a few other changes to 1
which attention should be directed. !
One of these is that on a fair catch
the opponents must retire ten yards
back from the mark of the catcher, j
This is like the rule of the Har
vard-Pennsylvania - Cornell code,
and is a wise provision, placing
more of a premium upon making,
fair catches. The rule regarding
interference with the man snapping J
the ball back has been made a lit
tle more stringent, and the referee
will see that the ball is fairly put
in play and also that the opponents'

do not interfere with either the ball
or the man. Fora few seasons
they have kept their hands off the
ball and have jostled and annoyed
the man. This next season this,
too. will be forbidden.
" It had also become imperative,
owing to the increased practice and
importance of quarter-back kick
ing, to establish some rule a* to what
kind of a kick was to be interpreted
as giving the opponents fair and
equal chance at tlis ball. This has
been attended to by a ruling that
I the ball must pass beyond the line
of the scrimmage.
" The majority of other changes
I are not of a nature to affect the
play in any way."
