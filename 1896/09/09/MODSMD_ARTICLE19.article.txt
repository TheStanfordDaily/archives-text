The American School at Athens
is appealing for funds to carry on
some special investigations.
The University of Paris has
neither classes, nor regular gradu
ation, nor athletics, nor college

college dormitories, nor a regular
campus. In spite of this handicap
several thousand Frenchmen are
managing to get a university educa
tion there.
