# The 						Hopkins Seaside Laboratory
## 
### 
; Ihe fifth session of the Hopkins
Seaside Laboratory, which began
June 14 at Pacific Grove, was an
eminent success from the stand
point of the work done, even though
! the attendance fell below that of
; previous years. About forty were
| in attendance, including a number
of Stanford students and several
eastern scientists who attended for
i purposes of original research.
I Among the latter class were: Prof.
I Bitter and Prof. .Johnson of Berke
ley, Prof. Saunders of the South
1 Dakota Agricultural College, Prof.
! Wheeler of the University of
I Chicago, Bashford Dean, professor
|of biology at Columbia, and Pro
j fessors Show and Heath of Stan-
I ford.
The following acted as instruc
tors: Dr. Oliver P. Jenkins, pro
fessor of Physiology and Histology,
Stanford; Dr. Charles H. Gilbert,
professor of Zoology, Stanford;
Harold Heath, instructor in Zool
ogy, Stanford; Bay L. Wilbur, as
sistant in Physiology, Stanford;
Walter R. Sh aw, instructor in
Botany, Stanford; Miss Anna L.
Brown, artist; Miss C. S Stolten
berg, assistant in Physiology, Stan
ford.
After all, the Hopkins Labora
tory amounts to a big seaside pic
nic, with a little work to leaven the
lump of fun, and this year was no
exception to the rule. To hegin
with, there were summer girls and
summer men galore. The male
portion of the Stanford crowd were
together in one big club house, and
they kept life interesting. There
were two Stanford hops, one just
after the school opened, the other
shortly before its close, and they
were eminently successful even in
gay Monterey.
The Monterey flag celebration af
forded another opportunity for
amusement, but the most unique
event of the summer, from a stu
dent point of view, occurred July
1, when a whale was taken at the
Monterey station. A half-holiday
was immediately declared, and the
whole school went "whaling."
Some of the original investigations
made that day on the structure of
blubber are said to be among the
most valuable achievements of the
summer.
The only blot on the summer's
enjoyment was the cruelty of the
hard-hearted instructor, who was
in the habit of getting the whole
school out at 4 a.m. for early morn- j
ing collections; and even this was
almost forgiven by those who en-1
joyed the Monterey sunrise on j
these early trips.
