# The
						University Orchestra.

### 
Next to the Mandolin Club, the
University Orchestra has always
been the most successful of our in
strumental musical organizations. It
originated in the fall of 1898, when
ten enthusiasts, under the leadership
of Conniek, '97, made a permanent
organization and began practice.
Although the club attained a fair
degree of proficiency that year, very
little was done in the way of public
performance.
The following year several good
players entered, bringing the num
ber up to eighteen. Conniek was
again leader and Dwver, '9(>, was

president. Regular practice brought
the playing up to a high standard,
and the first public venture, a
vaudeville for the benefit of the '9H
Annual, was a great success. The
same year the Orchestra took part
in a highly successful performance
of "Pinafore."
Last year twenty members, in
cluding most of the old men, re
sponded to the call for candidates,
and the Orchestra was in a flourish
ing condition all the year. It made
its first appearance in the city at
the Thanksgiving vaudeville per
formance. Later in the year '"Said
Pasha" was given under the aus
pices of the Orchestra.
This fall the Orchestra, like the
Band, has lost most of the older
men, and its condition will depend
largely upon the freshman material.
It is therefore urged that musicians
will find time to try fora place in
the Orchestra.
