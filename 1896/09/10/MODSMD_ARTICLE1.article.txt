# Debating- Interests

### 
With a view to informing new
students who are interested in de
bating, we publish today a short
account of the literary societies and
of our forensic relations with the
1 Diversity <>112 California.
Besides the Inter-Society Lea
gue, which is composed of all the
societies, there are in the Univer
sity five organizations, all more or
less interested in debating, viz.,
the Alpha, Euphronia. l'hilolexian,
Xestoria, and the Saturday Night
Club. Alpha and Euphronia have
their membership open to men
only, l'hilolexian and Nesto-iia are
open to both sexes, although their
membership is composed wholly of
men; and Saturday Night Club is
open to women only.

Alpha Literary Society, as the
name indicates, was the first society
organized in the University which
had for its purpose the training of
its members in all branches of lit
erary work. The initial meeting
was held on March 2(>, 1892. Its
membership included both sexes;
in faci the purpose of its organiza
tion was to secure equal opportuni
ties for literary work to both men
and women; the Students' Congrets,
which had been organized shortly
before, having excluded women
from membership. The literary
work for the first year consisted of
essays, debates, orations, recita
tions, and impromptu speeches.
The society even drifted into ama
teur theatricals, devoting one even
ing to scenes from Shakspere.
During 1892-8 the society split
into two factions, the result being
the withdrawal of the women. The
work of Alpha has undergone a
gradual change, its sole object now
being the training of its members
in public speaking. The program
usually consists of extemporaneous
speeches and debates and also pre
pared debates and orations.
To give its members additional
training in extemporaneous speak
ing, and also in the art of toast
making, the society held its first
annual banquet on December 1-1,
1895. The affair was a success and
will be continued.
The society has a large and in
creasing membership and is in a
flourishing condition. Members
become such upon a two thirds
vote. Any student is eligible.
Grant L. Williams, '97, is presi
dent for the present semester. All
are invited to attend the literary
part of the program.

Id .January, 1898, nine enthus
iasts. believing that the needs of
the University had outgrown one
society, organized Euphronia
A. M. Cathcart, E. A. MeGeorge,
J. A. Colliver, C. J. Pierson, B. M.
Mullock, E. P. Dodtl, Willard
Tohin, M. F. Mledsoe, and L. J.
Hinsdill were the charter members,
and Cathcart was the first presi
dent. Several new members were
added before the close of the spring
term, and the society was put on a
linn basis the following fall, when
a number of strong men came in.
Membership increased to about
twenty-live that year, and the
choosing of Cathcart to represent
Stanford on the inter-collegiate de
bate caused a raise in Euphronia
stock.

Kuphronia has always been con
servative as regards admitting
members, and tlie limit of thirty
five lias never been reached. Last
year there were about thirty mem
bers. but at least one third gradu
ated with '9f>. The society's main
object is systematic training in de
bate. All are invited to tlie liter
ary portion of the regular meetings.

The Nestorian Literary Society,
the third debating society to appear
at Stanford, was organized Septem
ber, 1894, with a membership of
twenty-seven. Meetings are held
every Saturday evening in room 10
of the quadrangle at 7:30 p.m.
The object of the organization is
improvement in forensic and elo
cutionary practice. The literary
session of all meetings is always
open to visitors. The usual pro
gram consists of periodical reviews,
set and impromptu speeches, dis
cussion of events of the week, and
regular and extempore debates.
The subjects for regular debates are
given out two weeks early with the
names of the speakers. Any stu
dent of the University who is not a
member of any other literary soci
ety may become a member.
Only ten members of the old so
ciety have returned this year.

The Saturday Night Club was
organized in the year 1895. It be
gan with a membership of twelve
enthusiastic young women. Since
that time the interest has steadily
increased until now it is a flourish
ing society.
Great enthusiasm is shown by
the young women, who are regular
in attendance and willing and in
terested speakers.
The object of the society is to de
velop the oratorical powers of the
members.
The membership is limited to
twenty-five All young women of
the University interested in de
bating, and who are ready speakers,
are eligible to membership.
A debate is given every other
Saturday night. Four members
take part in the discussion, two on
each side, and the society decides
as to the merits of the debate.
Discussions are given without notes
and are based upon the topics of
the day, also historical and ec
onomic problems of general interest.

Jn the spring of 1894 the Inter-
Society Debating League was formed
by the two societies already in the
University. The others have since
been admitted as they were organ
ized. The objects of this league
are concerted action of the debating
interests, and the supervision of the
preliminary, inter-society, and in
tercollegiate debates. Most of the
work is done by an executive com
mittee, and a sub-committee ar
ranges details of the intercollegiate
debate. A system of inter-society
debates was arranged for at the
first inception of the league, but
this idea has never been carried
out, although the society held two
very successful meetings last spring.
T. A. Storey is the present presi
dent.

The regular intercollegiate debat
ing events are the annual debate
with University of California, and
the Carnot medal contest between

six individuals, three from Berkeley
and three from Stanford. The
intercollegiate debate is managed
on the Stanford side by the Inter-
Society League. Preliminary de
bates are held every year, generally
in the fall semester. In these
debates three individuals from each
society and three from the student
body at large contest for the honor
of representing the University.
I'he whole number of debaters is
broken up into divisions of four or
six and each of these divisions pre
sents a debate. From the character
of the arguments presented at these
debates the judges choose the three
successful speakers.
The Carnot medal is given by
Baron de Coubertin in order to
stimulate interest in French affairs
and to encourage extemporaneous
speaking. The arrangements are
in the hands of a faculty committee,
and the three Stanford represent
atives are chosen by competitive
debate from the whole number of
candidates. The subject for debate
must be some question of contem
porary French politics, and extem
poraneous speaking is encouraged
by the fact that sides are assigned
to the contestants about thirty-six
hours before the debate occurs, li
is a matter for regret that the in
terest here was so slight last year
that there was no preliminary eon
test, the three Stanford represent
atives being the onlv persons who
came forward as candidates.
Stanford and University of Cal
ifornia are even in debating mat
ters, each having won two intercol
legiate debates and placed one
Carnot winner. The silver cup
offered by the San Francisco Ex
aminer and held for one year by
the college winning the debate, has
gone twice to Berkeley and once to
Stanford. Three victories for one
university means permanent pos
session, so a Berkeley's winning
next year would mean the loss of
the trophy to Stanford.
