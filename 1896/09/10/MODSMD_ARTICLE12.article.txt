It is si lamentable circumstance
for the members of the Elementary
Law class that the University law
library does not offer greater ad
vantages in the way of reading
matter for that course. There are
something over one hundred stu
dents registered for this course in
Law, and,as is apt to be the case

with perverse college youth, all the
members of the class wish to study
their lessons at the same time.
Consequently there is a great rush
for books at the very time when
that class of books are most in de
mand. The next day there are apt
to lie numerous unaccountable fail
ures in recitation.
There may or may not be a rem
edy for this, but it might be a good
plan for the members of the class
to be divided up into study-hour
sections and arrange certain hours
for each section to have free access
to the books.
