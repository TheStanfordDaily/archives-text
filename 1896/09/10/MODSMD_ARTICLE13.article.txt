year and arranging for an immed
iate t rial of voices with which to re
plete their thinned ranks. Ten
members of the old club are back
and if all are able to hold their
positions there will still be as
many more vacancies to be tilled
right away. These vacancies exist
in each of the four voice divisions
of the club, and if present indica
tions are not deceiving there will
be a lively competition to determine
who shall till them. The trial will
be held on Saturday. Every stu
dent who makes any pretension at
all of singing should turn out and
try fora position. All trials are to
be made under the supervision of a
professional instructor, who will
undoubtedly discover superior qual
ities in many voices which have
heretofore been an unknown qtian
tily. Positions on the glee club
are among the most desirable of
those of any of the college organi
zations, and it is safe to say they
will not be allowed t<> go a-begging
through w:int of competition or in
