### 
There has lately appeared from
the press of The Whitaker «\r Kay
Company of San Francisco a new
hook by President David Starr
.Jordan, entit led "The Care and Cul
ture of Men." The book is neatly ,
bound, plain but attractive in ap
pearance, and consists all told of
2(i7 pages. It is dedicated to Janej
Lathrop Stanford. In his prefatory 1
note the author states that the vol-1
nine is made up of addresses relat
ing to higher education delivered!
at different times before assemblies;
of teachers and students. Most of
these addresses have been pub- j
lished in the leading magazines of j
the country, but for purposes of the:
present volume appear in an im
proved and elaborated form.
As the title of the book indicates,'
the subject matter deals almost en-1
tirely with the higher education of j
man in its various phases. In a (
series of chapters the author tells
of the great value of higher educa
tion to the community, the state,
and to man in general, and its
large responsibility in supplying
to the nation its ever present need
of men. The evolution of the col
lege curriculum is traced from the
time when the entire course was
taught by a teacher of universal
knowledge, up to the conditions of
the present when the college as a j
separate factor of our educational;
system is being gradually merged
into the preparatory school on the
one hand and the university on the
other. A chapter is devoted to the j
exclusive topic, "The Care and i
Culture of Men," the substance ofj
which was contained in Dr. Jor
dan's address to the commence-1
nient class of 189-5. Another chap- j
ter de;ils with the intellectual
growth of man and contains many
of the author's famous ideas on the
" theory of evolution." Science in
the high school and in college,
practical education, the relation
between law schools and lawyers,
and the higher education of wo
men are all treated in a corres
ponding manner and reveal the
benefits to be derived from self
cultivation.
The topics handled are treated in ;
Dr. Jordan's most masterful man-'
ner. The language is flowing and |
pleasant, a well-known character
istic of all his writing, and the par
agraphs sparkle with brilliant
ideas and philosophical and scien- 1
tific reasonings.
The volume is for sale at the J
University only at the co-operative i
store.
