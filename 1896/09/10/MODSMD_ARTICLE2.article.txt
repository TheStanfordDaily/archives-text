The first cross-country run was
held last night after the punting
practice. The course was not much
over two miles, but several of the
men dropped out and many of
those who finished showed signs of
distress. Every man who expects
to try fora place should get into
these runs and improve his wind.

Captain Fickert will continue to
lengthen out the course every night
until the line-up practices begin
next week.
