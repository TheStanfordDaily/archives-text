# Tonight's Practice
## 
### 
Seventeen Varsity candidates, in
cluding eight freshmen, three of
last year's Varsity, and six second
ten in men turned out to practice
this afternoon. Dole, Fickert, and
Jeffs were the Varsity men who ap
peared. Other Varsity and second
team men, for no visible reason,
saw lit to witness the practice from
the side-lines. These men should
be out, not only for their own bene
fit, but for the training they can
give to the new men.
The squad punted for half an
hour and then went on the regular
run. Freeman and Soper sent the
longest and best punts. Lannigan,
also, did some good kicking. He
puts plenty of force into his punts,
but kicks in very bad form. The
whole squad, with the exception of
Fickert, Jeffs, and Freeman, seemed
out of condition and in need of con
siderable training before they get
in form.
