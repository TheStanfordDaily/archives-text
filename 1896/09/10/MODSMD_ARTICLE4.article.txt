# New Specimens From Doctor Jordan
## 
### 
The Biology laboratory has just
received two ten-gallon tanks of
lisli specimens sent from Alaska by
Dr. Jordan. The collection has
not been carefully examined as yet
and will not be mounted until the
president's return. A hasty in
spection, however, has discovered
several new, undescribed forms.
Many of them are deep-sea speci
mens which have been dredged by
the Albatross. Others, however,
have been gathered among the
rocks and pools. Only a few forms
besides vertebrates are included.
