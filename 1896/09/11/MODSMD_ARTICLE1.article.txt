# Tonight's Practice.
## 
### 
Twenty-two men appeared for
football practice this afternoon, an
advance on the number which came
out yesterday, but still not nearly
all the candidates. Fiekert, .Jeffs,
Williams, and Dole represented the
Varsity contingent; the other Var
sity men and several prominent
members of last year's second team
seem to imagine that they are sure
of their positions and do not need
preliminary practice.
Soper did not appear, and Free
man led the squad in punting.
.Murphy also kicked well, and his
sure catching was a feature of the
practice. Murphy's catching is the
best seen on the field since Harrel
son's time. Among the freshmen
light, quick men seem to prepon
derate. This is encouraging, since
we have an abundance of men for
the heavier positions, but are in
great need of ends and backs. The
new men, for the most part, seem
afraid of the ball, and are disposed
to let the older men do all the
punting and catching.
The regular field has been dressed
with straw and thoroughly har
rowed, and the squad will he put
to work there next week, when they
will line up for the first time. The
liability to accident will be much
less than in former years on ac
count of the improved condition of
the field. Cross-country running
will be continued until the men get
into condition.
