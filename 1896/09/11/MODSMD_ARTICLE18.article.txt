The football management has
announced as the probable date for
the interclass football games the
l!Mh and 23d days of September.
Whether they can possibly take
place then is questionable, but

taking into consideration the fact
that very little time can be devoted
to the class contests, the necessity
for immediate organization of the
teams is apparent. One team was
called together, but its members
failed to respond. If thesecontests
are to continue and be as success
full as in the past, more interest
must be shown and that immed
iately. The upper classes have not
yet held meetings and managers
for their teams have not been ap
pointed. Unless the class games
take place on or about theappointed
dates the schedule of the Varsity
will be interfered with. Work of
organization should begin at once.
