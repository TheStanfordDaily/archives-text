Editor Daily Pai.o Alto: It
would seem to me expedient that
attention he called to the use, or
abuse, of the sidewalks by bicycle
riders. Ido not know of any rule
forbidding the use of them by the
wheelmen, except the one holding
them to the right path on Univer
sity avenue, but common sense
should tell for whom the walk is
intended. The roadway is wide
and good. Why not ride there?
Or, if the cyclers must have a sep
arate path (as they should) apart
from the road used by horse-pro
pelled vehicles, let them use the
path set off for them â€”the one to
the right leading from the Univer
sity to Palo Alto.
A pedestrian often, as wheelmen
know to their sorrow, jumps in a
direction opposite to the one ex
pected and, as a result, there is a
collision, with damage to tempers
and bodies, with the greater advan
tage, or less loss, to the walker.
These evils should be remedied.
One young woman, evidently a
novice, had three collisions on her
way to the University between the
main gate and quad, and only got
to the buildings with her wheel at
all through the timely assistance of
a member of the faculty. The same
day, while going to Palo Alto at
noon, I was struck by a rider going
at a high rate of speed, who was
thrown off his wheel and himself
and machine more or less injured.
As for myself, I was hardly aware
of the happening, the contact with
the wheel being barely felt. The
cycler blamed me ior not avoiding
him, regardless of the fact that not
only in sentiment but in law the
pedestrian has the right of way, es
pecially on a sidewalk.
Can not, then, something be done
so that foot-travelers a nd wheelmen
may have exclusive paths? (live
to the bicyclers the use of one path
and let them tight it out on their
lines, where all are equally at a
disadvantage in case of a collision.
For it is a matter of fact that the
rider always suffers in these en
counters more than the person rid
den over. I>. A.
