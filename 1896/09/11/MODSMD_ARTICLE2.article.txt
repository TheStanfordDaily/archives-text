# Choral Society Begins Work.
## 
### 
The Choral Society held the first
rehearsal of the year Wednesday
night in the chapel. Kighty mem
bers were present, including fifty of
last year's members and thirty who
are newly enrolled. The new mem
bers include some of the strongest
musical talent of the University.
Last year about eighty per cent,
of the members were students, the
remainder being outsiders and
members of the faculty. This year
the percentage of students will be
much larger. The chorus is so far
weak in female voices and the wo
men of the University are especially
urged t<Â» join.
The first part of the work for
this year has been pretty definitely
marked out. Mendelssohn's can
tata "Come, let us sing" will (irst
he taken up, followed by the (.1 rand
March Irom Tannhauser.
