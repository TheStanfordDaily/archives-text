### 
The Stanford Mandolin Club
held its first rehearsal last evening,
twenty-four members being present
who will compete for places. The
following will try for the positions
named :
First mandolin: Wells, '97,
Sevvall, '98, Arnold. '00, Lanegan,
'00 ; second mandolin: Bartholo
mew, '99, Kaufman, *07, Cotton,
'00; third mandolin: White. '00,
Walter, '00, Thomas, '99, Noble,
'98, Meyers. '99 ; first guitar: Wil
son, "9t», Bolter, '97. Met ill ire, '97,
Seward, '00, Nicliolls, '00 ; second
guitar: Sladen, '9<S, McChesney,
'98, Welsh.'97, Durrell, '99, Snipes,
'98.
The prospects this year as far as
talent goes are very bright, and in
the matter of instruments and
equipment the club is more fortu
nate than in any preceding year of
its existence.
Among the new instruments
which will attract attention this
year are a mandola, manufactured
expressly for theclub by the Mason
Company of Boston, and more im
portant still, an instrument few of
which are in use in the United
States, a lute purchased in Italy.
This lute, which has a deep, rich,
and mellow tone, resembles very
much a mandolin in appearance
and takes the place of the cello
which the club formerly u-ed.
If the consent of the Student
Body can be obtained the Mando
lin Club intends giving a series of
weekly concerts this fall. The
series will commence about the
middle of October and will include
concerts at San Jose, Salinas, Wat
son vilie, Santa Cruz, Monterey,
Betalunia, Santa Bosa, San Fran
cisco, and Oakland, as well as on
the campus. In addition it is
hoped that the club may be able to
take a trip to Portland during the
Christmas holidays.
