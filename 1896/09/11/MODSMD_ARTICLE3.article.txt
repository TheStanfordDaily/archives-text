Lacrosse is again being agitated
in the University, lliis time with
fair chances of success. It is un
derstood that there are several en
thusiasts over that game in the
University of California, and ne
gotiations are being carried on with
a view to holdinga regular intercol
legiate contest. If this can lie
brought ahont, the future of the
game is secured.
Dole, ".IS, Walker,'s)B, Brunton,
'99, are working to bring the club
into being. These three, with Dul
ley, '5)11, are the only lacrosse play
ers at present in Stanford so far as

its first opponents.
Lacrosse is the Canadian national

game, and originated among the
Indians. It is played on a lield
roughly resembling a football grid
iron, and is like association foot
ball in that the object is to carry
the ball between the opponent's
goal-posts. The I»;i 11 is a small,
hard affair, and "cross sticks," re
sembling in shape a Canadian
snovvshoe, are used to carry and
throw it. Lacrosse calls for cool
ness, speed, and endurance, and is
just a little rougher than football.
