# New Entomological Specimens.
## 
### 
During the course of t he past va
cation a party consisting of
eight or nine Stanford students
made a trip extending along the
coast from Alaska to Lower Cal
ifornia for the purpose of collecting
birds for the zoological laboratory.
In addition to the many valuable
birds obtained, a collect ion of bird
parasites was made. This collec
tion is a desirable addition to the
Entomology department, as it in
cludes many new and hitherto un
known species. As nearly all the
valuable collections of this kind are
owned and made by foreign special
ists, these specimens will be a val
uable acquisition to the University
collection.
