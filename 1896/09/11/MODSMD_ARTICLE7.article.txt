# Dr. Jordan's Little Joke.

### 
The papers of the Coast have
been agitating themselves unduly
about Dr. Jordan's little hoax in
the current issue of the Popular
Science Monthly. To assist the Call
and others in appreciating the joke
we publish the following from the
Chicago Tribune:
"David Starr Jordan, President
of Stanford University, h;is just
presented himself to the country as
a scientific joker in a paper on the
'Synipsychograph' in the current
issue of the Popular Science Monthly.
''Prof. Jordan seriously describes
an experiment of the 'Astral Cam
era Club of Alcade' proving that a
thought will leave an impression
on a sensitive plate—in other
words that thoughts may be photo
graphed.
"The 'Astral Camera Club' was
formed, he explains, to investigate
modern problems along the purely
scientific lines of photography, it
made extensive tests of the Roent
gen ray, and kept abreast of the
latest investigations of the scien
tists of Europe and was much in
terested in an experiment of Prof.
Inglis Rogersof London, who found
'pictures could be produced in
darkness hy means of invisible force
and invisible waves sent out by the
mind could also affect a sensitive
plate.'
"He then decribes with scientific
detail how Prof. Rogers gazed fix
edly at a postage stamp fora few
minutes, then retired to a dark
room and looked through a camera
;it a sensitive plate, the result being
a photograph, somewhat blurred, of
the postage stamp which was in his
mind.
"The Astral Camera Club was
much interested in this experiment,
and seven of its members under
took to beat it by visualizing an
imaginary conception of a cat. The
alleged result, a composite photo
graph of their feline thoughts, is
printed in the Popular Science
Monthly. In describing the picture
President Jordan says:
" 'As might be expected in a first
attempt, there is a lack of co-ordi
nation of the parts. Mr. Gridley,
the schoolmaster, had planned his
cat on a large scale —a huge cat
face, with gray, radiant whiskers,
looking directly at the beholder.
Most of the others thought of the
cat in lateral view or profile. These
variant and vagrant individual im
pressions naturally appeared on
the camera before the other waves
were co-ordinated and the reflex in
fluences came from all to one, reg
ulating and co-ordinating the
thought of the cat. Thus these
preliminary impressions are re
corded as ghost pictures in various
places about the plate before the
ultimate composite view was
achieved.'

'•This is conclusively abstruse,
l>ut the closing sentence of the pa
per gives the credulous reader a sad
awakening:
"'Meanwhile the cat of Mr.
Thompson, the janitor, who alone
could answer this question, lay in
the darkness under the warm stove
and purred softly.'
"And this, it is said, is the truth,
the only truth in the article. The
photograph was made up by Prof.
►Sanford (one of President Jordan's
faculty) of seven composite views
of the college janitor's cat, and for
the express purpose of assisting in
this hoax upon the innocent pub
lic."
"The college janitor" is good!
