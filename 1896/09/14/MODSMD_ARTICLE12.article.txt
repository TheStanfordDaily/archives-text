Elskwhekk mention is made of
the request of (lie Chapel Union for
funds to carry on the work. In no
oilier large university in this
country are there so few calls made
for subscriptions, and so few little
leaks on the student's pocket-hook
as at Stanford. The only general
subscriptions are those of the Stu
dents' Guild fund and the Asso
ciated Students, amounting in all
to two dollars a year. The Chapel
Union's request for funds seems

moderate, in view of this fact. The
average attendant at any city
church pays out every mouth much
more than any of us are asked to
pay each semester for the support
of the chapel services, which take
the place of a regular church at the
University. Surely such of us as
are attendants at the chapel ser
vices can afford to contribute the
sum needed.
