# SOLOMON AND CHRIST.
## Sermon by Rev. Tenney of San Jose. 
### 
Rev. Melville Tenney of San
.lose delivered the regular sermon
yesterday. The influence of the
Choral Union was shown by the
improvement in the music. liev.
Tenney spoke from Matt, xii, 42:
"For she came from the uttermost
parts of the earth to behold Solo
mon, and behold a greater than
Solomon is here. '
Solomon was the ideal king of
the Jewish nation, long looked back
to for wisdom and greatness.
Christ, in the words of the text, re
cognizes Solomon as a great king.
The queen of Sheha, a great
queen, came to sit at his feet; yet,
Christ says, here in your city is a
greater than Solomon, and ye know
him not. Christ recognizes that
Solomon's human qualities pre
vented him from being the great
teacher.
Today we will compare these two
great teachers and try to show
wherein Christ was the greater. In
the lirst place there is Christ's con
sciousness of his divine power.
Christ says, "/ say unto you"; yet
lie always acknowledges that he is
one sent., that lie is the chosen one,
that there is some one else behind
him. We could not spare Solo
mon's sayings from the wisdom of
the ages, but there is no personal
ity in Solomon's proverbs. They
are the voices of a thousand men
and women. Solomon's wisdom
was not strong enough to stand
against passion, as wisdom never
is. Behind truth there must he a
divine authority to make it truth.
Com pa. re this wisdom with Christ's.
No preacher in the world ever had
such an audience as Christ, and it
is all the result of his personality.
Solomon never stirred men up to
great actions, but look at Savona
rola. Luther, Knox —all the result
of Christ's teaching. It is not ar
gument that moves men but the
''verily, verily" of authority. Con
viction must be personal, and so
Christ stands for the greatest of
teachers, with authority, divine
power, behind him.
Again, Christ's authority is not
the authority which speaks and re
fuses trial. Christ's truths can be
proven. They are given out spon
taneously, authoritatively, but they
are founded on truth. But, you
say, the sermon on the mount is
impracticable 1 say that every
truth spoken there is practicable.
When every man turns his cheek
to the smiter, we will have an ideal
condition of things.
Notice, too, that Christ surpasses
Solomon in the lone of his wisdom.
Solomon has the pessimistic tone
which ma ny men assume after they
have studied deeply the problems
of human life. There is no pessi
mism in Christ; he had no doubt of
what he was teaching. His thought
differs from Solomon's as it differs
from that of most modern teachers,
lie brought always good tidings:
we are children of the immortal
Father; we are not of the earth,
earthy; the flesh shall not shut out
the heavenly vision—a,ll this he
teaches. Ile acknowledges the brute
in man, but he shows how purity
may lie attained, so that the moods
of the tiger shall yield to righteous
ness. llis promise, the sweetest the
world ever heard, is at the bottom
of his teaching: I am here to give
yon more life, that ye may have
more life, and have it more abund
a lit ly.
Lastly, Christ is more sincere
than Solomon. Solomon knew how
to gather riches, to handle men,
bis words are Mowers of wisdom,

but lie himself did not keep his;
own maxims. On the other aide is
the one pure, whose whole life was a
glorious vindication of his teach
ings. This, so far as we can dis
cern, is the greatest point of his
teaching, lie says ''I stand here!
to vindicate my own teaching.''
In conclusion, I would call your
attention, students, at the beginning
of your new year, to the one who I
wit Iks beside you every day, and
whose words are: "Come unto me."
So may you, in coming here, gain
not only intellectual knowledge hut
knowledge of the power, the beauty,
the strength of true manhood and'
true womanhood as he teaches it to
you.
