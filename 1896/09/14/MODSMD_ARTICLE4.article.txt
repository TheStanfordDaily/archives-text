# The 						Football Squad.

### 
Only seventeen men appeared on
the oval for practice Saturday af
ternoon. Of these but four were
members of last year's Varsity. A
few other veterans stood among the
groups of spectators and watched
the practice. Some of these men
remain away from practice on pre
texts that, are flimsy, to say the
leas-t. But the chief fault seems to
be with the management in not
: providing outfits for the players.
I The new applicants have been fitted
out with suits while the majority
of the old men have not been'pro
vided for It is understood that
suits have been ordered but they i
have not yet arrived and conse
quently some of the best men have
lost a week's training. The new
men with very few exceptions show
a deplorable lack of training in the
rudiments of football, catching, and
punting.

Until the coach arrives the only
j way in which the men can he
! taught is by working with men who
j have had the advantage of college
j training, and it seems but reason
| able that the management should
I have made some arrangements to
lit out the experienced men for the
; first practice in order to give the
green hands as much training as
I possible before the coach shall ar
rive. \\ it.li but three or four old
men on the field and with even
fewer footballs with which to prac
tice, the new men will gain very
little advantage from this prelim
inary t raining even though it does
! harden them somewhat.
The practice on Saturday con
j sisted of the usual punting and a
cross country run. Soper and
j hreeman led by long odds in the
i punting. Soper seems to have the
I advantage in the length of his punts, !
j while Kiviman shows a little bet-1
I tei ti'iin. His kicking is not quite'
Iso Hire as rioper's, still he has aj
spiral which he should be able to i
; make good use of after a season of!
conscientious training. Of the;
I other men Murphy appears to do
the best work in catching and punt-1
i '"g.

'■Jule 1 ' Frankenheimer was on
the Held during the practice game
and nia.de himself useful by giving
"pointers'' to the new men. While
there are a good many freshmen
on the field, very few candidates
for the other class teams ha ve ap
peared. As the first inter-class
game is scheduled for the nineteenth
it is high time that these teams
should line up and get down to
work. In the past the class teams
have served to bring out good ma
terial which otherwise would have
been overlooked, and besides, these
games are the cause of creating a
frreat deal of interest and enthus
iasm. The regular squad will line
up fora few moments' opposition
play on Wednesday and it would
Ije well if the managers of the class
teams should get their men to work
by Wednesday at least.
