# Freshman Meeting.
## 
### 
The freshmen met in the physics
lecture room yesterday at 1:80 and
adopted a constitution and bylaws
and also nominated officers. Mr.
liealey, temporary chairman, sur
rendered the chair to Mr. Kinney.
The constitution is similar to those
of other classes.
The members were eager and en
thusiastic. On every question ju
venile eloquence flowed. The ques
tion of taxation without represen
tation was downed when it was
proposed to limit the holding of the
presidential office to those students
only who were in regular and par
tial standing. A provision in the
constitution providing for the im
mediate election of officers was
changed so that the election will
take place one week after the nomi
nat ions.
The class adopted a novel pro
vision making a quorum one-third
of the entire class. The quorum is
thus made, in round numbers, more
than one hundred. The class may
expect some difliculty in securing
this number for ordinary business.
A provision was made requiring
every candidate for office to be reg
ularly nomina ted. This does a way
with the possibility of independent
candida tes.
The constitution was adopted as
a whole, and nominations for the
•presidency were called for. The of
fice went begging for an occupant.
The nominations for the various
offices are as follows:
President —Madden, Higley, Wil
son.

A controversy arose as to the se
lection of football manager. It
was the evident wish of the major
ity that some upper-classman be
chosen, but in what manner this
will of the majority should be ex
ercised was the question. Football
Manager Brown was present in be
half of the Athletic Committee and
announced that the committee had
full control over the athletics of the
I' Diversity, and stated the intention
of that committee to choose a man
ager of the freshman football team.
A motion authorizing the Athletic
Committee to so act was carried,
but was decla red out of order, as it
conflicted with the constitution al
ready adopted. The constitution
was amended and a motion was
carried providing that a committee
of five be appointed to confer with
the Athletic Committee as to the
election of a freshman football man
ager. The committee are: Mur
phy, chairman, White, Bidwell,
Higley, Ilea lev.
