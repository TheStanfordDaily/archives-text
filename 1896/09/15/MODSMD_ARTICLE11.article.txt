# Last Night's Practice.
## 
### 
The football squad to the number I
of twenty-five got. on the regular
field last night for the lirst time.
The thorough dressing which it has
received in the last few days has
put the ground in excellent condi
tion, although the surface is a little
loose. Punting and catching was
followed by a few minutes of passing
and falling on the ball. Fisher is
improving in catching, formerly his
weak point. Murphy's passing was
quick and accurate. The men, al
most without exception, fell on the I
ball slowly and awkwardly. There j
is need of a great deal of practice in
this line, as ability to fall on the

ball (juickly and surely is impor
tant, especially for hacks and ends.
