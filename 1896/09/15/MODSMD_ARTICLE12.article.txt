The largest crowd of the season
appeared 011 the football lield this
afternoon. Fully thirty men
donned their canvas jackets and
chased the pigskin over the "straw
lot." The work lasted for an hour
and a half, and consisted of punt
ing, catching, signal practice, and
a cross-country run.
Strange as it may seem, there are
a few of the freshmen who show
far greater skill in handling the
ball than the majority of the old
men. Higgles, Lanegan, Murphy,
and Madden handle the hall very
cleverly and show that they have
had considerable training before
coming here.
After the preliminary practice
Captain Kickert chose two elevens
at random from the croud, and
lining them up had them go
through signal practice fora few
moments. Captain Kickert con
siders this a better plan than
lining the men up for scrimmage
practice before in suitable condition.
It is his intention to have the
elevens do this work for several
nights, and then to line them up
for opposition play. In this way
the men will learn some team wonc
and at the same time become har
dened for the rougher work to fol
low.
Several of the old men were
again forced to play the part of
spectators for the simple reason
that the management has neglected
to supply them with suits. The
men are very anxious to
get to work in order to be in suits
able condition for the hard knock
when tlie teams shall line up in
regular practice. The whole blame
seems to be with the management,
and since so much time has already
been wasted through neglect in or
dering the outfits in season, it
should be seen to that such a state
of affairs is not allowed to occur
again.
The crowds which attend the
practice games have heretofore been
a great source of encouragement to
the team and provision should be
made for them at once. At present
the onlookers are compelled to sit
on the ground or to stand. Under
these circumstances a large attend
ance can not be expected. It would
be an easy matter to move the
bleachers into the old position on
the side lines, thus providing seats
for the feminine contingent at least.
The 'iiV) team lined up for signal
work after the regular practice.
The personnel of this team has
changed, and, it is to be hoped,
improved remarkably since last
vear.
