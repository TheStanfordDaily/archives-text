It is to be regretted that the au
thorities in control of the Univer
sity library no longer permit ;i

after library hours. Whatever
may be the reason for such action,
it is regrettable, depriving, as it
does, every book in the library of
some scope of its usefulness. If

effort to acquit themselves accord

was too valuable to be abused by a
book-lover.
