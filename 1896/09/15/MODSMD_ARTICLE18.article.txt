There seems to be a general
scarcity of football uniforms with
which to tit out the different candi
dates for the team this year. Sev
eral of the old men complain that'
they are unable to appear upon the
field for practice because of the lack
of the necessary clothes to wear. If
this condition of affairs be true,
there must be a considerable num
ber of men debarred from partici
pating in the practices whose ser
vices would be of great value to the
college. Perhaps the increased
number of candidates has occa
sioned the shortage; perhaps some
of the new suits ordered have not
yet arrived; af any rate the scarcity
just now is a serious deficiency, and
the football management owes it to
the team and to the college to see
that the proper remedy is supplied
at once. i

There seems to be a tendency
this year among a certain class of
students to confine their work to
one or two particular lines of study.
Among the scientific students is
this especially the case. Many
students graduate from the scien
tific departments without having
devoted an hour to the humaniz
ing studies. General courses in
literature, history, economics, and
ethics are offered which are val
uable to students of other lines of
work. A general knowledge of
these branches is necessary to a
well-rounded education. No tech
nical knowledge is complete without
the addition of some work wholly!
different in character.
The student of the arts should,
Dy the choice of some scientific
study, avoid likewise the tendency
to -narrowness. Human nature
has many sides, and the over-de
velopment of some at the expense
of others is to be deplored.
