### 
Dr. Ross returned from the East
Monday morning in time to meet
his class in Transportation. He
proceeded immediately to the class
room to explain the course and
map out the assignments for the
work this semester. Dr. Ross came
directly through from Chicago
University, where he has heen en
gaged in giving a live weeks' course
in Sociology.
Speaking of matters in the East
Dr. Ross said: ''This is the hot
test campaign the East has seen in
many years. Everybody is con
cerned about the political issues,
and almost everybody is capable
of discussing them intelligently.
While there I wrote a series of
articles for the Chicago llr.cord in
addition to my university work.
These lectures have been put into
book form, and will appear today
in Chicago. It is a small book of
about sixty pages, entitled "Honest
Dollars." It will be copiously
illustrated in cartoon and other
wise. 1 understand that the
National Democratic Committee has
ordered 20,000 copies of it.
"Was I beaten in debate by Dr.
Laughlin while at Chicago Univer
sity as reported in the San Fran
cisco papers? That was a, mistake
with absolutely no foundation. I
never had a debate with Dr.
Laughlin and don't know how the
report was started. No, I was not
embarrassed by the students ask
ing questions on the money issue.
That is another newspaper story.
I delivered a lecture, that was all.
"After my first speech at the
university, 1 had many urgent in
vitations to speak in Chicago, but
could not do so on account of mv
work at the university.
"It is very difficult to make a
rational prediction of how Chicago
or any part of the East will go in
tlie corning election."
