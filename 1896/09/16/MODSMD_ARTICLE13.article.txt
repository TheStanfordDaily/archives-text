Some people, sad to say, do not
appreciate their privileges, and one
of the privileges not appreciated
here at Stanford is the great free
dom allowed by the professors in
the use of their private libraries.
When a man is kind enough to
lend another some of his valuable
books and requests their return at
a specified time, it seems that or
dinary courtesy would prompt the
borrower to comply with the re
quest.
