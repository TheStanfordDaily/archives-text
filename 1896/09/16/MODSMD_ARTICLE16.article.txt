The action of the Executive
Committee of the Associated Stu-j
dents at last night's meeting in
granting to the (Jlee Club the ser
vices of a professional instructor
can not be commended too highly.
It means that a most active inter
est is being taken in the affairs of
the musical organizations by those
in control of student body manage
ment, and that with the excellent
material now in the club and the!
aid of a competent instructor to
I bring that material out, the Uni
versity is to possess a glee club far
superior to any of its predecessors.
Plans are being made to have the
Glee Club, in conjunction with the
Mandolin Club, give a series of con
certs this semester in towns adja
cent to the University, with the in
tention of devoting the proceeds to
the liquidation of the debts in
curred by the student body during)
the southern trip of the clubs last |
spring. If these plans are carried]
out the decision of the Executive j
Committee t<Â» engage an instructor!
was indeed timely. All traces of j
the old feeling between the mem-J
hers of the clubs and the officials of 1
the Associated Students seem t<>!
have disappearad, and everything
is working smoothly and harmoni
ously towards the advancement of
the interests of both organizations!
as a whole.
