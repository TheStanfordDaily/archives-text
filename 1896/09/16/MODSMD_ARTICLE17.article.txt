Editor Palo Alto: The re
corder has now made pul>lic the
statistics of the present freshman
class. They show the' total num
ber of applicants to be HBO, an in
crease over last year of 125. Of
these applicants 142 failed to meet
the requirements for entrance, leav
ing a balance of 088 as the total
number admitted. It is in view of
such numbers as these, and the
prospect of an increase in the fu
ture, that causes us no little con
cern. At best our present accommo
dations are limited. The library
is often so crowded that no seats
are left, and it requires every in
genuity to arrange classes in the
buildings. Hut with the yearly in
creasing additions these will fall
shorter than ever, and we shall be
under the necessity of limiting the
nlimber of entranees.
The question of accomodations
came up in the last meeting of the
Hoard of Regents. It was suggested
IÂ»y Regent Keinstein that the Gov
ernment would lend the university
a number of military tents large
enough to hold about fifty persons.
The plan might be a good one. If
ever put into operation it would
serve to show the real need of more
buildings, and then perhaps we
might have one.
The election for track manager
was held last Friday. It was the
most spirited election ever known
in tlit' history of the university.
Each of the three candidates had
good backing and no one thought
1 hat the vote would be decided on
the first ballot. To the surprise of
everyone it was. Gut of 887 votes
cast, 517 were for Wood, '9K, giving
a majority of nearly a hundred
over tlie total votes of the two other
candidates. This was the largest
vote ever polled in the university.
Athletic training has now begun
in earnest. The football, baseball,
and track men are on the campus
nearly every evening. The football
team went under training rules
yesterday. Thirty-seven men have
entered their names for places on
the track team. They have all
signed the training rules, agreeing
in the main to abide by the advice
of the track captain with regard to
contests and training. Practice
for the inter-class baseball games
show some very promising fresh
man players. Bkkkklkyan.
