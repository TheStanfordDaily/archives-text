# The 						September Bachelor of Arts.

### 
The vacation number of the
liarkelnr <>112 Arts is out. The mag
azine maintains its usual high
standard in this number. The
articles are pertinent to college men
of the present day, and the editorials
touch upon many of the main
questions which are agitating the
university world. Among the
notable articles are: "The Roman
Catholic Church and Science," by

H. (i. Chapman; "Canada's Choice
of Government,'' by S. R.Tarr;and
''Spring in Autumn," by Clinton
Scollard. The magazine preserves
the distinctive but awkward form
of its lirst. number.
It will perhaps be remembered
that the llurhelor <>J Arts last year
offered a prize of $125 for the best
story by an American undergradu
ate subscriber. The time limit of
this contest, originally set for June
I, 18!t(), has been extended to .Jan
uary, 18i>7.
