# California Teacher's Certificate.
## 
### 
There has been quite a demand
lately for information concerning
the qualifications necessary to be
come a teacher in a high school.
At present the school law of Cal
ifornia, Sec. 1775, provides that
boards of education "may also,
without examination, grant . . .
certificates of the high school grade
to holders of California State Uni
versity diplomas when recom
mended by the faculty of the uni
versity " Graduates of other in
stitutions of the same rank as the
University of California may re
ceive diplomas under the same con
ditions.
The State Board of Education in
INiU ruled that no board of educa
tion should consider the application
of anyone applying fora high school
certificate under the provisions of j
Sec. 1 770 unless the applicant had
professional training equivalent to
that required in the pedagogical
department of the University of
California.
The department of education in
Stanford has observed the require-!
ments demanded at the University!
of California, which are. according
to J. B. Anderson, state superin
tendent, "not less than six hours
per week for at least one year."'
The department of education,
down to the present, has recom
mended otdy those graduates who
have fulfilled these requirements.
During the last \var. however, the
recommendations of ihis university
have been questioned by three of
the leading counties of the state.
The present law concerning certifi
cates of teachers is very sure to be
changed at the next meeting of our
legislature; if so, the graduates of
accredited universities will probably
be required to have professional
work equal to that required by the
University of California of those
students whom it recommends. Its
requirements are steadily advanc
ing. At present they are:
"Kegular students may receive a|
teacher's recommendation with the i
bachelor's degree, providing they
have complied with the following
requirements:
"1. Special knowledge The com
pletion of work, amounting nor
mally to twenty hours a week for
one half-year, in the subject or
group of closely allied subjects that
the candidate expects to teach; the
ultimate decision as to the candi
date's proficiency resting with the'
heads of the depa rtntents concerned. J
2. Professional knowledge—The
completion of work in Pedagogy
(which may include the course on j
the Philosophy of Education) '
amounting to twelve hours a week j
for one half-year. M. (reneral
knowledge—Courses su'ikicnl. to'
represent (with the inclusion of I
special studies) four groups from j
the following list: natural sciences, j
mathematics, English, foreign lan
guages, history, philosophy. This;
requirement is intended to secure,
so far as is possible, breadth of cul
ture and sympathy with the various
lines of high school work."
