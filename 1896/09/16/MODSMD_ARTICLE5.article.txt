"Education and Social Progress" ,
was the subject of the first regular'
Tuesday evening lecture, given last j
night by Prof. Powers. In his
introductory remarks Prof. Powers j
cited the differences between the|
republics of (ireece and Home and:
the American republic, and the,
new principles which make the
American republic possible, as i
gathered from an article of Presi
dent Eliot of Harvard in the Forum. \
Toleration in religion, /. freedom'
of thought; better domestic re-i
lations: attention to means of public j
health and pleasure; co-operation!
service, developing ;i sense of loyalty .
and trust; increase of mutual depen-:
dence of man on man; are a few of J
j these principles.
But all these questions have their
other side. The problem is ;i much
broader one than any mere differ- <
ence of social institutions. It is!
whether any institutions are going
to endure, and under what con-
I(I it ions t hey are going to endure,
j We may live under a president, or
maybe :t king. It makes no differ-j
ence under what rule we are, so!
long ;i> we have stable social exist
ence.
The question is more than what]
■ form of government is going to con- j
serve our interest; it is whether any)
i institution is going to conserve our j
interests.
The bearing of education upon
the permanence and progress of
society, was the chief subject of thej
evening's lecture. Faith in the|
continuous progress of society, is [
the only thing that gives a basis j
for an optimistic view of life.
The question is, Is society go-1
ing to succeed, improve? Is edu
cation conducing to that end?
When we speak of universal edu
cation, we feel a thrill of patriotism.
The goal of education is to make I
one more of a man. Education j
has no great social value, if it
doesn't really educate. It must!
give the individual useful facts, on
must cultivate useful faculties. I
The facts are not the final criterion.!
A gre.it many things are worth
learning, that are not worth know
| ing.
The purpose of education is to
equip the individual to look out
for the daily needs of life. Very
j few students view education from a
social standpoint. We are taught
things that stand in noway to the I
| adjustment of the welfare of society.'
| Education is conducive to society,
: when it is harnessed into society's,
service.
Recognition of the theory or senti
j ment of community of interest,'
I makes society. We must create the i
! things that society must possess,!
I ('. (/., we must have a vast national
j music; music is the type of a very j
| large number of things—nuclei i
that maintain the stability of
j society.
Society is now waking up from !
an unconscious state that has l
! possessed it. People have not been
conscious' of such a thing as society.!
I Society is now engaged in a process,
iof self-introspection. It must be. j
We must face the problem of society
consciously in our educalion. 1 n<li
vid iiiil education has fulfilled its
goal when it has merged man in
the great human mass.
