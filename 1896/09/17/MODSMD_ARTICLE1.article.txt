# THE 						COACH COMING.
## Mr. Cross Reaches Here Tomorrow. 
### 
Football manager Brown received
a telegram today stating that Mr.
Cross, who is to coach the football
team this season, will arrive in San
Francisco tonight on the Overland
train. Brown went immediately
to San Francisco to meet him.
He will probably come down to the
University tomorrow so that the
team will have the advantage of
his presence from the beginning of
opposition play.
