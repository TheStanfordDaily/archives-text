For some time past a birge num
ber of students have been eating
their lunches in one corner of the
quadrangle. The majority have
apparently forgotten that a barrel
is placed near by. At present any
scraps or papers which they wish
to get rid of are dropped on the
ground. The whole place is lit
tered with garbage and makes that
part of the quad a nuisance. It
would be well if the janitors would
clean up, but it would be still bet
ter if the students would be more
careful in the future.
These students have another bad
habit Each one carries a chair
from a neighboring class room and
leaves it wherever he happens t<>
eat his lunch. So far no serious
objections have been raised. But
let those chairs become soaked by a
sudden shower, or let some profes
sor hold a class in one of those
rooms without chairs, and then
those students will have to seek a
new place in which to eat their
lunch, fora notice will say,
"Please don't take any chairs from
this room."
It is to be hoped that no second
appeal will have to be made in
order to stop these nuisances.
