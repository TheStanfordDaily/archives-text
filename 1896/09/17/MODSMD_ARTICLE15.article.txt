Thk rally of young Republicans
to lie held in San Francisco next
Friday evening will be addressed
by one speaker each from Stanford
and from Berkeley. As the
University of California Glee
Club is to he present, there is
sure to be a large Berkeley
contingent to encourage their
speaker. It is earnestly urged
that all Stanford men who can
possibly attend will he present
at the meeting to "root'' for our
representative. The Berkeley con
tingent is sure to outnumber ours,
but a handful of men with the old
yell have before this worked won
ders in the line of applause.
