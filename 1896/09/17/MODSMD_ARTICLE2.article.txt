# Football in the Dust.
## 
### 
The football squad turned out at
the usual hour yesterday and prac
ticed on the Held, which is in a
very dusty condition. The surface
of the ground has become loosened
and pulverized to such a depth that
one can not step on it without sink
ing in considerably; consequently
when the players run and scramble
after the hall, a cloud of dust and
line straw is kicked up and hovers
over the Held. This is certainly
dangerous to the players.
In spite of the poor condition of
the gridiron, however, the men
showed that they were not afraid of
hard training, though some showed
a tendency to shirk when the cap
tain's back was turned.
The practice differed little from
that of the preceding night except
that it tended to emphasize the fact
that many of the candidates have
still quite a good deal to learn. This
is especially noticeable in the man
ner in which they fall upon the
ball. Higgles, H. Thomas, Mcin
tosh, and Murphy, with the possible
addition of one or two others, are
the only ones who seem at all
capable of touching the ball. Some
of the kicking was good, Lanegan,
Freeman. Soper, and Murphy lead
ing in this respect. Two teams
were made up to practice signals,
and the usual cross-country run
followed.
