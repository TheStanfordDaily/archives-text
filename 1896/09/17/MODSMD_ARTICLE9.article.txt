# An American Henley.
## 
### 
In the August-September number,
of the Bachelor of A rta there appears
a very strong article by S. Scovillej
Jr. on the advisability of holding a 1
"Henley regatta'' in this country. I
The writer takes the ground that J
such ;in event would be a most tie- j
sirable feature to introduce into our,
inter-collegiate athletics, and makes j
some strong points with which to |
sustain his opinion.
The Royal Henley Regatta of I
England was instituted lifty-seven 1
years ago. It is held in -Inly of
every year, and lasts usually about, j
<>ne week. Contrary to the general!
impression the regatta is not an
occasion of intense excitement or of
great strain, but rather a week of
genuine, wholesome sport. 10very
body comes prepared to lntve a good
time and the event is''one contin
ual round of garden parties, house-1
boat parties, dinners, dances, and!
all kinds of open air festivities.
One goes into the races for the fun
of the thing, and win or lose it's a
jolly good week."'
"It was tnis feature of Henley,"
says Mr. Scoville, "Hhat impressed
the Yale crew more than anything
else- -the lack of tension, the reali
zation that it is possible to row for
enjoyment as well as glory. Ac-j
customed to look at rowing as nee-!
essarily involving months of the
severest physical work and a
Spartan-like regime under which
all amusements were tabooed as de-'
trading from the chances of win
ning, they suddenly found them-'
selves among a crowd of big, lusty,!
happy fellows who were glad to be
there, who bad looked forward to j
Heniey week as the playtime of the
year, and now that they were there
proceeded to enjoy themselves as
thoroughly and enthusiastically as
only athletes can. The whole dif
ference in the system and spirit was
comprised in the fact that Yale
crews were accustomed to finish the I
season with relief, Henley crews
with regret. I will undertake to
say that there never was an Amer
ican who has once caught the spirit
of Henley week, but has wished that
some such event might be inaugu
rated in this country."
As to the feasibility of introduc
ing it into this country, the success
ful way in which the Continental
nations have imitated England's
Henley should lay all doubt on
this question aside. Regattas sim
ilar to this have been instituted in
Germany, Holland, Austria, and
Bohemia with such good results
t hat some of their crews ha ve been
able already to defeat crack Eng
lish crews.
One of the main advantages of
holding an American Henley is the
revival of interest it would cause
in rowing among the colleges. It
is well known that aquatic sports
of all kinds have been rapidly dy
ing out in this country, and it is
| believed the recognition of their
usefulness would soon restore them
to their former popularity among
the people.
The regatta could either be
held on the Thames or the Hudson
i river, the former probably offering
I the more preferable course. Men
I from all the colleges, academies,
and public schools in the country
who desired to send representatives

would he allowed to compete.
Competition would not lie restricted
to undergraduates or students of
colleges, Imt open to graduates as
well, and thus there would he an
incentive for the formation of crews
among university athletic clubs.
There would he different events for
the different classes of oarsmen, op
portunities for the subordinate
crews to show their mettle as well
as those of the first rank. Prizes
would be freely offered and "heat"
races introduced, the distance of
the course to he 1 5-IB miles, or
similar to that in vogue at Eng
land's Henley.
The regatta would he pre-emi
nently a college affair, one intended
for college brawn and college enthu
siasm. As Mr. Seoville puts it:
''A week that would offer every
small college an equal chance with
the larger ones, that would en
courage class crews and offer a cup
for fraternity and public school
crews, that would persuade the
clubs whose membership is com
posed of college men to go in for
rowing such a regatta would lill a
long-felt want, and once more put
rowing well up in the front as a
branch of collegiate athletics."
Such a scheme as is outlined in
this article is being quite generally
urged among college men and oars
men throughout the East, and has
met with much favor. It is not im
probable that it will he adopted by
ihe leaders of the large athletic
clubs of the country in the near fu
ture.
