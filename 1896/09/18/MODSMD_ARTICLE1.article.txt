# OUR NEW COACH.
## Mr. Cross Talks on Football. 
### 
Mr. Cross, who is to coach our
team this year, arrived at the Uni
versity this morning after a tedious
trip across the continent.
Even at first sight the man who
is to drill Stanford's team into
shape for the "big" game impresses
one as being capable of great things
at football. Not only is he a giant
in stature but he has that indescrib
able "something" about him that
betokens the athlete. To those to
whom the privilege of further ac
quaintance is given Mr. Cross ap
pears to he a perfect gentleman,
who is bound to win popularity by
his courtesy and the interest that
he takes in everything about him.
This is Mr. Cross's lirst visit to
the Coast —in fact it is the first time
that be has journeyed west of Cin
cinnati—and he tells many amus
ing incidents concerning his im
pressions of people and things in
the West. Especially was he sur
prised at the fact that the women
entered into the college enterprises
here on an equal footing with the
men.
Mr. Cross was deep in a discus
sion of football affairs with Captain
Fickert when a Daily Palo Alto
representative called upon him this
afternoon, but he spared a few min
utes for talking over the football
prospects.
In regard to football at Vale Mr.
Cross said that from what he could
learn the outlook is very encour
aging. He also said that through
out the East the tendency would be
this year toward a very open game,
and that those at the head of foot
ball matters were legislating to
make interfering with the center,
when handling the ball, absolutely
impossible.
Speaking of the Father of Foot
ball Mr. Cross said that Walter
('amp had given him to understand
that lie should find beautiful sur
roundings and a pleasant class of
people at Stanford, in none of
which he had been disappointed.
Mr. Camp had also praised the
work of the football men on the
Coast.
It is impossible for Mr. Cross to
form an idea of the football ma
terial as yet, but he stated that the
players whom he had met appeared
to be big, strong, healthy men, far
ahead of the men in the smaller
eastern colleges, such as Brown
and Dartmouth.
When asked as to his policy in
coaching the team, Mr. Cross re
plied that it should be very light
fora considerable time yet, and he
believes that this will be the plan
followed by the eastern teams. Last
year proved this to be the best
policy. The training fora while at
least will differ very little from the
course followed in the last few
weeks.
Mr. Cross said, in speaking of the
Henley regatta, that Vale had
taken her defeat philosophically,
knowing that Leander was a very
strong crew. It is the general be
lief among Yale men that had the
narrow blades been substituted for
the wide ones, Vale would have
had a better chance. If Yale en
ters another English regatta, the
shell will undoubtedly be rigged

to conform more nearly with the
English idea.
