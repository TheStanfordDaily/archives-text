# Orchestra Meeting.
## 
### 
Candidates for the University
Orchestra met last night in Encina
gymnasium for the first practice.
Fifteen men were present, includ
ing five old members. The practice
was largely in the nature of a trial
of new men. No definite results
are announced as yet, but it is
understood that the new musicians
are most of them excellent players.
The flute and violin players among
the new candidates are especially
good. Another practice will be
held next Thursday, when more
definite arrangements will be made
concerning final makeup of the
Orchestra.
