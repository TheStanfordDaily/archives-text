During the summer P. J. Schlo
bach was appointed curator of the
museum, in place of J. K. Wight,
'93, resigned. The new curator has
been very busy of late rearranging
several of the cases in the museum.
The final arrangement of the mem
orial room of Senator Stanford will
be made as soon as Mrs. Stanford is
able to be present. Work has also
commenced on the collection of
eggs, nests, and birds belonging to
the late William C. Flint, ex-secre
tary of the National Historical As
sociation. The collection came
into the hands of the University
about a year ago, and has remained
packed in cases in the basement.
Only a few cases of the eggs have
been unpacked, but the catalogue
enumerates over 3.500 different va
rieties, some of which are very rare.
The matter of arrangement will
probably occupy the whole year.
The art gallery has recently been
loaned a valuable painting by Mrs.
Smith of College Terrace. It is
Schafer's "November Day."
