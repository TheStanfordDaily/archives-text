Every person who conies to the
University should try to give some
of his time to University interests
aside from his work on a regular
course of study. The student who
is so absorbed in his books that lie
has no time for the various interests
of the University is not only miss
ing a very valuable part of his Uni
versity training but he is also fail
ing to do his duty here. It should
be the pride of the student to know
that he is giving something of him
self to add to the fair fame of his
alma mater. Besides this, the
chances are very great that the
leaders in University affairs will be
the leaders in the affairs of the
world later in life.
