There are numerous places
around the University where ex
tended conversations can l>e held
between the students without dis
turbing any one in particular; but
the library is not one of these
places. It is generally supposed
that the library is set apart for
study and that quiet should reign
there of all places. Outside the
railing whispering may be at times
excusable, but it is seldom so. Hut,

in any event, the strictest quiet
should he hy all means observed in
the alcoves where students are ad
mitted for special research work.
Lately this necessity for noiseless
work has been overlooked. Not
only have students persisted in
whispering behind the alcoves, hut
many have made bold to talk aloud.
This disturbance should not be al
lowed to continue in the midst of
students who want to study. If
the culpable ones do not reform
they should have their privileges
curtailed.
