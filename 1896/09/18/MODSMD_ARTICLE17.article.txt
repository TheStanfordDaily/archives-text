# Dr. Jordan on Women as Professors.
## 
### 
Among the literary features of
this year's Caatalian, the University
of Michigan annual, was a discus
sion on the advisability of admit
ting women to university faculties.
Prominent alumni of Michigan and
the presidents of the principal
western universities participated.
Dr. .Jordan expresses his views as
follows:
Womeh will be admitted to the
faculties of the American univer
sities when they are as well pre
pared for the work as the men with
whom they are to compete. A few
women are already in important
positions in the larger universities
and these are judged by the char
acter of their work and by the in
fluence they exert. When young
women are ready to devote years of
serious work, not to securing
degrees, not to preparing them
selves to do a certain work or to
meet certain conditions, but be
cause they want to know the truth
and the ways b}' which it is found;
when their aim is knowledge and
power, not social position or liveli
hood. they will find a place for
themselves, they will find work
worth doing, l hev must work for
the same motives as men, and with
the same persistence in ideals of
thoroughness and helpfulness.
The young woman or young man
who expects a college professorship
as a reward for tedious preparation
will he disappointed. Such positions
are not rewards for past work, but
places for new effort. Many young
women go into graduate work with
the attitude of precocious children,
posing for praise at each stage of
achievement, (ireat responsibilities
are not assigned to precocious chil
dren. The world cares nothing for
"Senior Wranglers." The question
with college authorities is, what can
we trust you do? Some women
emphasize "the heart element" in
their influence, substituting senti
mentalism for action. Women who
are made professors, not for their
clearness of intellect, but for their
"goodness of heart," have the worst
possible influence on students. A
good influence demands singleness
of purpose. A woman professor
must be womanly, but must not be
womanish. Intellect knows no sex.
Sentiment can not take the place of
wisdom.
Again, assuming all thorough
ness and earnestness of purpose,
woman will marry if conditions are
favorable. This usually means that
her relations to her profession are
vitally changed. She will need all
her wisdom in the new relation, but
not for the same purposes With
all this, the number of women
ready for professorships is small.
The number of failures among them
is proportionately great. It is
easier fora woman to get a profes
sorship than to get fitness for it.
Those really fit are none the less

appreciated for being women. The
salaries they command are quite as
high as for men of like ability.
The really successful woman will he
the one who forms her ideal of
scholarship or research and who
1 pursues it consistently, regardless
lof woman's sphere or woman's
destiny, or of the prizes or positions
which seem to reward turning aside
for aims lower than the highest she
knows. "Shall a woman he en
couraged to aspire to scholarship?"
Shall a duck he encouraged to
swim? Those who are fit need no
encouragement. They are born to
the ''hunger and thirst that only
the scholar knows."
