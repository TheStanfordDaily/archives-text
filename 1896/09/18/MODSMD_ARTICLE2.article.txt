# The 						First Line-up.
## 
### 
To the spectator at hist night's
practice it would appear that foot
ball had indeed started in earnest.
The lield had been sprinkled and
wms in splendid condition, the new
suits had arrived, and most of the
old men were out, and last but not
least, there was a large crowd of
spectators out who managed to do
a little "rooting" now and then.
The only thing lacking was the
grandstand, which should be placed
in position at once.
After the preliminary practice in
punting and catching two teams
were chosen and put through signal
pract.ce, after which they were
lined up for scrimmage practice in
the following order:
Holbrook rend 1 .....Madden
Cotton r tackle 1 Cuthbertson
Carle r guard 1 Bigelow
Wilbur center Buntin
Harrington . . 1 guard r. .1' R Smith
Perkins 1 tackle r Diggles
McUilvray. . . .1 end r Jost
Mcli tosh quarter Murphy
B Thomas. . r halfback 1 Dole
Jjanegan. . . I halfback r Fisher
Soper fullback. . . . Freeman
The scrimmage practice lasted
about five minutes, but the play
was fast, and furious while it went
on. Cotton made the only good
run of the day and was tackled in
a capita! manner by Madden. Mur
phy and McUilvray also did some
neat tackling.
It is impossible to judge of the
work of the men as vet. for me
work is decidedly loose. is
no team work and the play lias not
assumed any definite form. At
center "Hurripty Dumpty" Buntin
rather outplayed Wilbur, for the
latter seemed over anxious and
snapped the ball erratically. Free
man is a little too slow at starting
to make much gain at bucking the
line, but with coaching he should
develop into a very valuable man.
After the regular work the class
teams lined up for signal practice.
The freshmen were the only men
who turned out in sufficient num
bers to make up a full team. The
seniors made the poorest showing,
there being no captain and but four
of their men on the field.
