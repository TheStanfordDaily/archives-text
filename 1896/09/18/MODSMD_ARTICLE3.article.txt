# Tonight's Practice.

### 
The coming of the coach lias put
new life into football matters.
The players went at things with a
vim and dash which has heen lack
ing since the first line-up. Allow
ing for the inspiration of the coach's
presence, the fact still remains that
the new men have added an ele
ment of snap and "go 1 ' to this
year's work. In that respect they
are a likely set of youngsters, and
our needed hacks and ends are in a
fair way to he taken care of by
freshmen. The usual kicking prac
tice was followed by some special
work under Mr. Cross's direction.
While the backs kicked and passed
the line men were put to work fall
ing on the ball and starting. The
falling improved vastly under the
conch's eve; the men did not seem
afraid to throw themselves on the
ball or to " muss up" their clothes.
The starting of some of the players,

particularly the heavy line men,
was slow.
Two teams then lined up as fol
lows:
Seawright.. ..r end 1 Leavitt
James r tackle 1... . Thomas
Harrington, r guard 1 Bigelow
Cuthbertson . . center Buntin
Carle 1 guard r Adams
Cotton 1 tackle r Perkins
Mctiilvray. . .1 end r Madden
Mcintosh. . . .quarter Murphy
Fisher r half 1 Lanegan
Dole 1 half r Diggles
Soper fullback .... Freeman
The playing although ragged, as
is natural early in the season, was
marked by the same vim and en
ergy which distinguished last night's
practice. More furious playing in
a practice game has seldom been
seen here.
Freeman kicked off, and Soper
returned into touch. The ball was
captured by Murphy's side, and by
them gradually forced down the
lield to a touchdown, after about
ten minutes of play.
Soper hit the line low and hard
and interfered fairly. He was not
given an opportunity to show
whether his tackling has improved.
Murphy, McGilvray, Thomas, Sea
wright, and Mcintosh did some
good tackling. Fisher made one
good run, but was guilty of some
fumbling.
After the practice the junior and
freshman teams lined up for signal
practice.
