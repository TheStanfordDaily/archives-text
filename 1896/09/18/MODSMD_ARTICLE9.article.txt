Among the editorials of lust
night's Palo Alto was one which
we can not let pans without com
ment. We refer to the one concern
ing our ignorance "of the course of
affairs in the political and com
mercial world." Arrangements
have been made to procure for the
Rohle reading room a San Fran
cisco daily, six periodicals, besides
three of our own publications; hut
by an oversight the daily paper has
not been delivered to us. Last
year the San Francisco paper was
taken by the girls, and not by the
matron, as published. Roble.
