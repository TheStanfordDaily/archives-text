# THE 						SUNDAY SERMON
## Prof. Griggs on the Social and Industrial Crisis. 
### 
I'rof. (iriggs delivered the sermon
Sunday morning, treating in a
scholarly manner of the place of
religion in the solution of the pres
ent crisis. lie spoke in substance
as follows:
All reflecting students of modern
civilization have heen impressed
with the rapidly increasing dis
turbance during the decade immedi
ately past in our industrial and
social world. Continued effort is
made to account for these conditions
by temporary causes. In most cases
the disturbance is attributed to
the political party which may hap
pen to be in power. That political
changes and measures are a factor
in the problem can not fora mo
ment be denied, but the common
tendency is to attribute to them
vastly more influence than they
possess. We must recognize that
the real cause of this disturbance is
much more deeply seated than ihe
legislative measures <>t any party.
The great wrongs of today are
not political, but social and indus
trial. Each year the problem of
the drawing apart of rich and poor
is growing more difficult of solution.
The vital social contact of one class
with another, so necessary to right
social conditions, is rapidly passing
away. Even charity, which for
merly brought rich and poor into
personal contact, is being left in the
hands of organizations. The sep
aration of our resident districts
into hovels and palaces has caused
the churches and the public schools
to be separated along class lines.
Literature even is losing its vital
ity. Art must have its roots in the
foundations of human nature, and
it will present nothing but polished
conceits if it is cultivated by an
isolated class.
Anyone who lias thought deeply
must realize that old methods of
dealing are inadequate in this de
cay of democracy. This question
means life or death to our civiliza
tion. New problems need new
solutions.
So what we need today is a new
ethical force, anew inspiration such
as Christianity brought into the
decaying Gracco-Roman world. We
make much, too much, of the re
semblance between our state and
the Roman state. We are made of
a fusion of new races. Our pes
simism is not a sign of decay; it is
the picturesque melancholy of
youth. Vet in the industrial up
heaval and the growth of class dis
tinction, there is a shallow surface
parallel between our own and the
:incient world.
Christianity came into the
Roman world as a revivifying in
fluence. It brought, an opportunity
of escape from the dead dreariness
of their life. The early Christians
opposed all things pleasant and
beautiful as taking awav from the
one great thing, the purity of the
soul. It opposed all that was best
in the pagan world. It could not,
therefore, spread among the higher
classes. It worked up through the
common people to the higher
classes, until it revivified all society.
Our problem is very different,
and our needed remedv is verv dif

ferent. Christianity, with its face
turned to the past, is in itself in
adequate to solve the problem. It
is a doctrine of escape from this
world, and therefore can not deal
with all the questions of practical
life. It is a gospel of self-abnega
tion, but what we need is a gospel
of self-realization. Our new gospel
must teach that this life is con
nected with the next, and that if
it is good at any time it is good
now.
Finally, if the problem is to be
solved, it must be solved in Amer
ica. We are free from the narrow
clericalism of England and the
scepticism of France and Germany
and the issueies with us. Young
men and women of America, the
solution of this crisis is on you.
Oh! for the voice of a Savonarola,
the character of a Christ, to call
men to solve this problem! Each
of us is the center of a human
world, with the tides of life flowing
all about him, offering to him in
finite possibilities of union with it
all of attainment of love and wis
dom. Let us work together not
only for ourselves, but for the
larger humanity.
