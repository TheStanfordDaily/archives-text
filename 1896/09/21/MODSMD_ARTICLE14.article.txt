The small "muckers" of Mas*field
and Palo Alto are to he excused on
the ground of ignorance when they
laugh at the awkwardness of players
on the football field, hut the same
excuse can not he made for the fel
low students of these players. There
is unfortunately a class of men,
known in our common university
slang as "perpetual freshmen," who
are constantly bringing reproach
upon the whole University hy their
inconsiderate and often ungentle
manly jeers. A delegation of "per
petual freshmen" was responsible
for the unfortunate affair which oc
curred last year on our diamond,
and this same element is now con
cerned in laughing at two or three
really good football players who
are beginners but who are doing
their best for the athletic interests
of the Universitv.
