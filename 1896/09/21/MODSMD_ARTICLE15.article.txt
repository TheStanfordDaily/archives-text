# A
						Practical Proposition to Stanford.
## 
### 
At theChristian Association meet
ing last night a new Stanford enter
prise, which has been under con
sideration for some time bv some
of the students and professors, was
made public. It is the support, to
the extent of at least $500 this year,
of a work among the students of
India conducted by Mr. G. Slier

wood Eddy, Vale '5)2. Mr. Eddy
is known to a number of our stu
dents and professors, and all feel
sure that we could have no better
man to represent the Stanford
Christian Associations in the foreign
Held, unless it were one of our own
alumni, ile is a man of great
ability and earnestness, and has
been prominent in the East for
several years in connection with
the Student Volunteer Movement.
He has felt that his life work was
in India, and so goes this fall to
begin work there among the stu
dents. He goes at his own expense
and expects to support himself in
India, but his work needs a sup
port which he can not fiive," mo the
i . ! Â«i
opportunity has come to us of giv
ing this support. In undertaking
this work the Stanford Associations
are getting in line with those of the
large colleges and universities of
the East, many of which entirely
support one or more men in the
foreign field.
The plan which is followed in
many institutions, and will be fol
lowed here, is to raise the money
required by weekly gifts. Every
one interested in this work, whether
student, member of the faculty, or
friend, is asked to help it. An
effort will be made to reach all
personally, but of course some may
lie missed, and any such may send
their names and the amounts they
wish to contribute weekly to Miss
S. M. Dickson, or 1). L. Arnold.
Some little canvassing has already
been done, and with surprising re
sults. The work here will be under
the direction of a committee of nine,
three from each of the Christian
Associations.
