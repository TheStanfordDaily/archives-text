There is a feeling of righteous
il isoonten I and re I »el 1i« »n among
nianv students in Fnciua Hall,
caused by (he levying of what they
deem an unjust and unnecessarily
large guarantee tax. I His assess
ment of two dollars is collected
from each lodger, regardless of the
time he may occupy a room, and is
ostensibly expended for general di
lapidation. Now, whatever dam
age is done to the interior of the
room must lie made good by the
occupant at the end of each year;
therefore the conclusion may read
ily be drawn that the money is
used to repair the corridors or base
ment. Does it seem reasonable
that there should be between $200
and of such damage each
year?
The dormitory is this year run
essentially upon the hotel plan. A
snlliciently large rent is charged,
which should cover all general di
lapidation. The damage to furni
ture and walls is paid by the occu
pant-: yet year after year the chairs
and tables become more scratched
and unstable, and there are holes
in the plaster made by students
years ago. What i- done with this
money paid 'for interior damage if
the damage is not repaired?
lint this condition of the rooms
is not what the students so much
object to. It is only one example
< if loi >se ma ilagemen t.
What they want, and what they
hope to gain by tins article, is an
itemized statement of last year's
disbursement of the *o called "di
lapidation fund." The -indents
contend that they have a right to
know how their money is expended.
The receipt states that any surplus
will be refunded, yet we do not
know what the surplus is. The
student must accept, the paltry re
bate of thirty-five! or fifty cents un
questionably and with perfect faith
that it is all which is due him
Last year the guarantee was
$1.")0, and no rebate was given.
I here is a rumor that a portion of
the money was appropriated to the
uses of the Students' Hoarding
Club, and to settle this question
this appeal fora statement is
made.
None of the students would object
to a small d"p«isit proportional to
the time the rooms are occupied;
but since the only just expenditure
of this money would be upon the
corridors or the basement, and since
no extensive repairs are evident, ill
common justice a statement is due
them before they are forced to pay
an increased assessment this year.
