# On the Gridiron.
## 
### 
There was not a sufficient num
ber of men on the field Saturday to
form two teams, as many of the
players attended the game at Bel
mont. Consequently there was no
opposition play. The time was
devoted to catching, punting, fall
ing on the ball, and foot-racing.
The effects of Mr. Cross's coach
ing are already apparent in the
way the men have improved in
falling on the ball, an accomplish
ment which, a week ag<>, seemed
far beyond the majority of the
players. But there-is one thing in
connection with this practice which
should be discountenanced at once;
it is the tendency to "guy" one or
two of the men who are a trifle
clumsy in their work. As a mat
ter of fact, the very men who are
made fun of are far more proficient
in this feature of the sport than the
men who do this "joshing." A
little guying is all very well in its
place, but no man with a proper
amount of college spirit about him
will criticise another who is doing
his best for the honor of his Uni
versity. A man who is willing to
devote two or three hours of his
time to work which will help his
Varsity win laurels on the gridiron
deserves the respect of every mem
ber of the student body, and he
should be encouraged to the fullest
extent, rather than disheartened by
the remarks of a few alleged hu
morists.
The squad indulged in two sprint
ing contests on Saturday and,
strange as it may seem, the heavy
line men proved to be tne swifter
in both events. Captain Fickert
was twice victor, and was followed
closely by Carle and others of the
heavy men, while the light backs
and ends, from whom better things
should be expected, were compelled
to yield to their weighty opponents.
