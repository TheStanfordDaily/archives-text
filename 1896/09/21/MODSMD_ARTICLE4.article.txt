# "ROBERTS' RULES" TO DATE
## The 						Freshmen Amend Their Constitution. 
### 
The Freshmen have already dis
covered the mistake of having their
quorum one third of the class, or
something over one hundred. A
• 1V i •
meeting Was Announced for 1:30 Fri
day and not more than thirty fresh
men appeared. A meeting of the
class was called for today at 1:30
p.m. in the physics lecture room.
About fifty members of the Fresh
man Class met in room 50 this
afternoon for the election of officers.
There being no quorum present it
was legally (?) moved that the
article in the constitution fixing a
quorum at one third of the class be
changed. Twenty members was set
as a quorum. Just exactly how a
meeting which is legally no quorum
can amend its own constitution
passes the parliamentary compre
hension of an upper-classman.
The following officers were elected:
President, Higley; first vice-presi
dent, Braden; second vice-president,
Miss Streeter; secretary, Hunt;
treasurer, White; sergeant at arms,
F. H. Adams; member of the Ath
letic; Committee of the Associated
Students, Birch; member of the Ex
ecutive Committee of the Associated
Students, Higley; baseball man
ager, Lougheed; executive commit
tee of the class, Hayden, Lewis,
White, and Beckett.
Speeches were called for arid Hig
ley, White, and Braden responded
briefly. The committee on class
colors reported in favor of pink and
gray. The report was referred to
the committee for further consider
ation. Action on the class yell
was postponed and the meeting ad
journed.
