If the interest shown in last
night's practice can he kept up
throughout the season we shall
have the most successful football
team this year that ever wore the
cardinal. Never before have things
looked so encouraging during the
lirst weeks of actual work. Nearly
lifty candidates appeared on the
field last night, and the (day con
tained that true snappy quality
attainable only when each player is
doing his best. Besides, there was
a good-sized crowd of on-lookers to
lend encouragement to the men,
and it is needless to say they were
well repaid for their efforts.
While the teams put a great deal
of sua]) and vim into their work,
still there has been no team work
built uj) as yet; the play is indi
vidual in character. But as long
as the men show plenty of life and
vigor there is an excellent founda
tion upon which to build. For
some time to come the coach can
devote his time only in "sizing up"
the men and drilling them indi
vidually. The development of
team work comes later.
The field was put in capital con
dition yesterday, and the bleachers
were at last placed in their old po
sition near the side-line. Nil*.
Cross appeared for thefiist time in
a football suit, and showed the
men, by example, how to fall on
the ball and how to start on the
instant the pigskin is snapped.
In the preliminary work the
backs were lined up in two squads
atone end of the field and were put
through a course of training in
punting and catching. At the
same time the line men were prac
ticing dropping on the ball at the
other end of the field. After a half
hour of this work the entire crowd
was drilled in quick starting.
The opposition play, although it
lasted but ten minutes, tended to
prove that Mr. Cross has the happy
faculty of bringing out the best
there is in a man. With a sugges
tion here and a word of encourage
ment there, he followed every play
and nothing seemed to escape his
notice.
The teams lined up as follows:
FIRST. SECOND.
McGilvray. . r end 1 Madden
C Thomas. . . r tackle 1 Russ
Carle r guard 1 James
Willia ms center Buntin
Fickert 1 guard r. . . . Bigelow

Dole 1 half r. B Thomas
Soper fullback. . . . Freeman
The best runs of the day were
made by Fisher, Dole, and McGil
vray. Fisher and Dole have im
proved in their work since last
year. Especially is this true of the
latter. In punting and catching
he is among the first on the field,
and his line bucking is a feature of
the games. McGilvray, although
a new man, has proved himself an
excellent ground gainer, and goes
at it like a veteran.
Madden, Dole, and Seawright
did first-class work in tackling.
Russ, '00, made bis first appear
ance and seemed able to break up

the line iit will. "Heft"' Williams
donned a suit for the first lime this
season and held down his old po
sition of center in a creditable man
ner. Captain Fickert's work at
guard bore the "old reliable"
stain]). After the scrimmage work
the class teams lined up for signal
practice.
