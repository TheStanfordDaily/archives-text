Yesterday's issue of the Berke
leyan contains a short article set
ting forth the complaints of many
Berkeley students that the period
ical Josh is fast losing its Berkeley
character and is assuming more
and more the air of a Stanford in
stitution. To satisfy all doubts on
this point the editor of the U. C.
department of Josh has been inter
viewed by the Berkeleyan and he
reports that the little periodical is
essentially non-partisan; that while
the claim in regard to the "cardinal
hue" of the Josh is perfectly true,
yet it is so "simply on account of
the tremendous enthusiasm with
which Stanford maintains her de
partment of the paper."
Coming as this statement does
from a rival paper and a rival ed
itor, it shows conclusively that
Stanford interests are being well
taken care of by her representatives
on the paper. Josh has quite an
extended circulation in San Fran
cisco and in this vicinity, and any
comparisons, favorable or other
wise, that can be drawn between its
two college departments will surely
have their effect. So fur Stanford
has good cause for self-congratula
tion on this point.
