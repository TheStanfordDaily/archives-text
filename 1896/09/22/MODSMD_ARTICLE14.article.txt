Attention of the public must be
again called to the fact that a great
number of the students have not as
yet paid their student body assess
ment. It is with the greatest re

luctance that we are compelled to
refer to this again. It is probable
that their negligence in paying this
important assessment —the only one
levied for the support of the student
body during the entire year —arises
more from thoughtlessness and from
forgetfulness of the importance of
prompt payment than from disloy
alty. From this assessment the
expenses of the student body are
paid. This is the only source of
revenue which the student body has
at its command until the proceeds
of the football season are available.
At present there are many expenses
connected with the football team
which are very urgent, and which,
if they are not met, will affect the
welfare of the team itself. Then,
also, the student body has gone to
considerable expense in fitting the
musical clubs for the Ban Jose con
cert.
The freshman can he forgiven for
a while for his delinquency and
hesitancy in paying this assess
ment, but not the undergraduate
who has witnessed the result of such
slowness in former years, nor the
upper-classman who criticises the
management for delay in fitting out
the team properly. If eastern col
lege men can willingly and eagerly
pay assessments ten times as large,
can we not he prompt with our
small contribution on which so
much depends?
