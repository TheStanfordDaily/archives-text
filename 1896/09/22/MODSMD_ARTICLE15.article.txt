# Dr. Macewen Here.
## 
### 
Dr. William Macewen of the Uni
versity of Glasgow, Scotland, spent
two or three hours at the Univer
sity yesterday morning as the guest
of Dr. Stillman. The distinguished
visitor in company with Starley
Stillman, instructor in surgery at
Cooper Medical College and a
brother of Dr. Stillman, was on his
way back to San Francisco from a
short trip to Monterey and Lick
Observatory, and stopped off at the
University long enough to gain
some idea concerning the work done
here.
Dr. Macewen is a man of world
wide reputation in the medical
world and ranks as one of the most
eminent surgeons of the times. He
occupied the chair of surgery in the
University of Glasgow and has
made that university famous
through his remarkable accom
plishments. He has been engaged
in delivering a series of lectures in
the large cities of this country,
having but last week finished a
course of a week's duration at
Cooper Medical College, San Fran
cisco. It is not an easy matter to
persuade a man of his reputation
and prominence to come so far
Weston a purely professional trip,
and much credit is due to Dr. Lane,
president of Cooper College, for his
efforts in bringing him to this
coast. Dr. Lane has lately insti
tuted a course of special lectures at
his college and intends each year to
have some man of wide reputation
appear before the medical students
of this region. Such a. course of
lectures will be of great interest to
the medical profession and of ines
timable value to the cause of med
icine and surgery on this coast.
Dr. Macewen's name is attached
to many of the most famous oper
ations known to surgery. He is
also the originator of an operation
known as "Macewen's operation,"
which is one of the most difficult
ever attempted and which has
brought him a large share of his
fame. He is a man of keen judg
ment and looked up to by the pro
fession as an authority on all
branches of surgical science. Drs.
Wood and Jenkins of this Univer
sity attended some of his lectures
in San Francisco and they report
him as a man of unusual ability
as a lecturer and a demonstrator.
