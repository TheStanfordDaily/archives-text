# Freshman Football.
## 
### 
The management of the freshman
team is trying to make arrange
ments fora series of games with
outside elevens. Heretofore there
has been very little pains taken to
find games for the freshmen. The
'98 freshman team played only the
Belmonts, who were too weak that
year to he of any use in giving
practice to the team. Last year's
freshmen went against Santa Cruz
and Centerville, at both of which
places they found comparatively
weak teams.
This year's freshmen have better
football material than the "infants"
of any previous year. With Lane
gan, Rusk, Ballentine, Murphy,
Bunliu, Carle, Brown, Seavvright,
Noursc, and a half-dozen other good
men, prospects are bright and an
especial effort will be made to give
them as many match games as
possible. Belmont, San Mateo. San
Francisco High School, Oakland
High School, and University of Ne
vada are among the teams which
the century class may meet.
