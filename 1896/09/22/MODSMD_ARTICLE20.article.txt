## 
### 
The interest taken by University
men in national politics received a
boom at the rally of young Repub
licans held in San Francisco Sat
urday night. The principal speak
ers of the evening were â€¢). M.Oliver,
U. C. '98, John M. Switzer, Stan
ford '98, and I). E. McKinlay, Re
publican candidate for presiden
tial elector. The speeches of the
two college men fully equaled that
of their more experienced colleague,

and far excelled the average cam
paign oration. An audience of 3.500
tilled the Auditorium to overflowing
and tliey heartily applauded the
speeches of the college men.
Mr. Oliver opened with an able
speech on the relations of silver
and gold as monetary units, and
the stand of the two parties on the
question. lie attempted particu
larly to prove the uneconomic hasis
of the Chicago platform and to de
molish the record of the Demo
cratic pTTrty.
Mr. Switzer was the last speaker
and as such had the hardest task
of any of the speakers. Neverthe
less, he held the audience to the
end. He was interrupted by fre
quent and long-continued applause.
He treated the subject from an in
ternational standpoint, snowing
that both parties are in favor of
bimetallism as the only adequate
solution of the money question.
He maintained that free silver
meant silver monometallism, and it
was a question as to which stand
ard would sooner bring about inter
national bimetallism. He showed
the effects of the Bland Bill and the
Sherman Act in retarding the fa
vorable attitude of Europe toward
international bimetallism, and
traced the probable effect of the
adoption of a silver standard.
