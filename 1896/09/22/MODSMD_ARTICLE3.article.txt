# Gymnasium Measurements.
## 
### 
A new rule in connection with
gymnasium work, which should be
very beneficial in its effect, was
adopted this year. This rule manes
it compulsory thai every student
registered for gymnasium \v< rk
shall take a physical examination
under the instructor during the se
mester. By this means the in
structor is made acquainted with
the individual weaknesses of those
taking the work, and can prescribe
special work for their remedy. The
physical measurement of the stu
dent will be taken and the itnprov
ment in his physique can be deter
mined by a subsequent measure
ment.
Over two hundred men are regis
tered in Eneina gymnasium and
thus far only sixty have complied
with this requirement. Every stu
dent can see that it would be to his
advantage to do so, as it is impos
sible to derive the most benefit from
the work until he is acquainted
with his particular needs. In
structor Storey will be in Eneina
gymnasium at the following hours
for the purpose of taking the meas
urements: on Mondays, Wednes
days, and Fridays, 9:80 to 11:80
a.m., and 2 to 5 p.m.; Tuesdays
and Thursdays, 10:80 a.m. to 12:80
p.m., and 2 to 5 p.m.; Saturday, 9
to 12 a.m., and 2 to 5 p.m.
