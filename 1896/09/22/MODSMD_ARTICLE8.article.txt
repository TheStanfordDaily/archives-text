# Berkeley Letter.

Editor Palo Alto: We have
had a very quiet week. Not that
nothing has been done, for indeed
much has been done. But no single
thing has engrossed attention.
Even politics, which, judging from
reports, seems so absorbing a topic
with you, with us holds second
place, and interest is confined to a
few.
The event of this week will be
the minstrel show. Both for the

program that it offers and the
cause for which it is given, the at
tendance is sure to he large.
"Brick" Morse planned it, and that
of itself insures success. The cast
includes many local U. C. favorites,
and assisted by the glee club, the
mandolin club, the banjo and
guitar club, and the Delta Upsilon
quartet, it will be quite a display
of university talent. But then,
above this, the proceeds are to go
toward the funds of the track team.
Now the track team is something
which appeals to the loyalty of
every U. (J. man; so, of course,
Shattuck Hall will be crowded.
The two political clubs will soon
receive an addition to their num
ber. The Gold Democrats are or
ganizing. Whether they will have
enough members to be of much in
fluence in the university it is hard
to say. The Republicans are far in
the majority, and this new club
will only serve to divide the opposi
tion.
The Republicans have been con
cerned chiefly with local work. At
a large meeting held last Friday
afternoon, besides discussing the
rally of the Young Men's Repub
lican Clubs, action was taken with
regard to the Berkeley primaries.
Several speeches were made advo
cating Mr. Fred S. Stratton for
state senator, and the meeting ad
journed, deciding unanimously to
support him in the election. U. C.
men were prominent around the
polls on the day of the primaries,
working for the candidate whose
election means the advancement of
the interests of the university.
Still another society has made
its appearance, this time among
the students in the engineering
course. They held a meeting last
Friday afternoon and organized
under the name of the Engineering
Society. Its purpose is to bring
those who take that course into
closer contact with one another and
to awaken interest along special
lines by papers and discussions.
The society expects to lie active in
providing for lectures by prominent
engineers.
The athletic men are turning out
every day for practice, as work on
the regular football field is not fin
ished. The practice so far has
been only in catching and kicking.
As soon as the field is finished the
first line-up of the year will be an
nounced, and we shall then have
an opportunity of seeing what our
new men are like.
The baseball game between '99
and '()() is scheduled for next Wed
nesday. It will be of interest
chiefly in showing what the new
men of '00 can do in baseball.
Candidates for the track team meet
four times a week in the gymnas
ium. They are now under full
training rules. Berkeleyan.
