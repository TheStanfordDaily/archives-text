WE MAKE ICE-CREAM TOO
Right next to our Rambler Cyclery, we have the best Ice-Cream
I'arlors between San Francisco and San Jose. The same engine that
runs the repair shop, turns the crank to the freezer, so our facilities are
the best. To make our ice-cream we use the best separated cream, us
ing only cream, ripe fruit juice, and eggs. The freezer is then run 150
revolutions per minute until it commences to freeze, then slowed down
to 75 revolutions until it is frozen hard. Fruit ices are frozen at a
faster speed. Our ice-cream soda is unexcelled.
Orders Taken and Cream Delivered in Any Quantity.
