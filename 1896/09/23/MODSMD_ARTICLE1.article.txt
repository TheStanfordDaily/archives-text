# Tuesday Evening Lecture.

### 
The second of the series of Tues
day evening lectures was given by
Prof. Earl Barnes, on the subject
"The Child as a Social Factor."
Three points of inquiry were raised,
viz: What is there peculiar in the
minds or characters of children
that makes them a social factor
distinct from adults? Secondly:
How does society try to take ad
vantage of these peculiarities for
the realization of its own purposes?
Lastly: How do children actually
react upon society and affect it?
Any one who has worked much
with children must have been im
pressed with the fact that they are
in some of their views and activities
extreme radicals, in others extreme
conservatives. These two tendencies
are seldom mixed, but a child is a
radical now, a conservative two
minutes later, and a radical im
mediately afterward. How can we
explain this curious two-sidedness
of the childish mind?
A study of the history of civiliza
tion seems to show that there are
three ways in which the race has
achieved and in which we may
achieve what we call knowledge
We may accept what we are told
-—authority; we may reason things
out — rationalism; or, we may labor
iously build up our knowledge by
increments —experience.
Now a child at first must rest in
authority; his very preservation
depends upon it, and if he is well
trained he comes to feel the satis
faction of strong support. But
there is in every child a natural
tendency toward logical activity.
As his muscles or his vocal organs
tend to move in certain related
series, so his mind tends to work in
logical sequences; and just as the
exercise of his body gives him
pleasure, so the exercise of his mind
produces a certain satisfaction.
The attitude of society toward
children or pupils will always be
determined by what society wants
done, and by its theories concern
ing the nature of childhood. The
tendency of children to seek sell
organization ami freedom through
relegating the little details of life to
forms and habits, has been eagerly
seized by society and 11 seel to form
the whole mind and character in
authoritative molds.
The intluence exerted by the
teacher upon society is not to be
sought alone in the fact that the
pupils are tin' coming generation,
and that when they arc grown they
will be society; but the piij ils have
at once and immediately a pro
found influence. He who would
seek the fountain of immortal
youth, must seek it today through
constant association with children.
