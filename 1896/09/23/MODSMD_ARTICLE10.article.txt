Cne cause, which has been gen
erally overlooked, of the apathy of
college men toward national politics
is the clause in our registration
laws which prevents the majority
of university students, as theoret
ical non-residents, from voting in
the precinct in which their univer
sity is situated. Men who can not
exercise the franchise naturally
take little interest in elections, and
the indifference generated at college
sometimes lasts through a lifetime.
Our registration laws would bear
amending in this respect.
