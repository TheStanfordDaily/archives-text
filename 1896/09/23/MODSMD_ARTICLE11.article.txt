Much interest is taken this year
in the Palo Alto by all the stu
dents, and this is especially notice
able among the co-eds. It is greatly
to the credit of the young women of
the University that they are taking
an increased interest in its public
life. It is an old saying that "two
heads are better than one," and the
united efforts of young men and
women in the cause of the Univer
sity can produce no other than
beneficial results. This year there
are more young women holding re
sponsible positions in University
activities than there were last year,
arid this is due to their increased
interest and activity in public af
fairs.
