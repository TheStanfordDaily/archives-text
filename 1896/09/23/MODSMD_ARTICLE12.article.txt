Selfishness has been defined as
the greatest sin in the world, and
certainly it is one of the greatest
sins at Stanford. A case may be
cited to prove this statement.
During the past week a certain class
had assigned to it several books of
reference to be read at once. Of
course these books were in great de
mand, and of course, too, there were
not enough to supply the demand.
A certain person decided to gain
access to all of the books, and ac

cordingly at noon gathered them
together, went into the back part of
the library, and read all afternoon.
Late in the afternoon the individual
departed, leaving the books stacked
up on the table, where they were
afterwards found by a student who
had failed to obtain any of them all
that afternoon. It is to be regretted
that anyone professing to study in
order to be thereby broadened
should so utterly forget and ignore
the rights and feelings of others.
