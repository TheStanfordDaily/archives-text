# A 						Stanford Player at Harvard.

### 
The Rocky Mountain New* of Den
ver, Col., has this to say of Ken
nedy, '95. the full-back of our '92,
'98, and '94 Varsity teams:
"There are good prospects of a
Denver man playing on the Har
vard varsity football eleven this
year. Bert Kenriotly, a son of S. S.
Kennedy, leaves ' thfc evening for
Cambridge. lie was there last
year as a first year law student,
but according to the new rule gov
erning athletics at Harvard and at
the University of Pennsylvania he
was debarred from playing, being a
professional man from another col
lege.
"Kennedy is a graduate of Ice
land Stanford .Jr. University, and
throughout his college years was a
valuable member of the eleven. He
is about 5 feet 10-J inches tall, and
weighs when in condition in the
neighborhood of I<SO pounds. Ac
cording to Dr. Sargent's tests, he
has proved himself to be thestrong
est man of his weight in Harvard.
His great strength is in his legs,
back, and chest, just where strength
is needed fora successful line
player on a strong eleven. He was
considered one of the best men at
Stanford, and had it not been for
the new rule would probably have
had no difficulty in getting on the
Harvard team of last fall. He did
a little practice work, and Captain
Wrightington of the '9H team was
very much taken with his work.
"During the present summer Mr.
Kennedy was at Estes Park and
while there received from the East
a football from Wrightington, with
instructions to practice kicking,
punting, catching, and falling on
the ball, in order that he might be
prepared to begin active work on
his return to college. Being a sec
ond year man he can play this
year, and while he says he is not
sure that he cares to try for the I
varsity, he admits that the tempta
tion to play while watching the
practice work is so great that he
will probably not try to resist it."
