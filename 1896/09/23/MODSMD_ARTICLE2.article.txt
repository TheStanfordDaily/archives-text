# In the Mud.

In spite of the fact that the rain
had transformed the gridiron into
a huge mud-puddle, the play last
night was full of "ginger,"' and Mr.
Cross expressed himself as well
pleased with the work.
The men appeared about 4:30,
and after going through the regular
preliminary practice they lined up
with the several class teams for sig
nal work. This lasted for ten mill

utes. at tlie end of which the regu
lar teams formed for opposition
play. The scrimmage work lasted
for eighteen minutes altogether, and
was divided into halves of twelve
and six minutes respectively, with
a rest between, during which fresh
men were substituted in someofthe
positions.
The second team gave the Var
sity a hard rub throughout the
practice, keeping the ball well in
their opponents' territory during a
greater part of the time. This may
be partly accounted for by the fact
that many of the second team men
are familiar with the signals of the
Varsity. At one time it looked as
though the scrubs would have an
other touchdown to their credit,
but the Varsity braced themselves
and regained the ball. As it was,
neither side made a touchdown.

The right side of the Varsity
seemed unable to protect the backs
properly, and as a consequence
Madden, Seawright, Higgles, and
Beedy had opportunities of proving
j that they are capable of doing some
clever work at tackling Of the
heavy men Fiekert, Williams, and
Carle put up the best game. Wil
liams' work was especially notice
able. He repeatedly broke through
the line, although his rix-Urrix,
"Baby" Buntin, is proving himself
a rather formidable man. Har
rington's work at tackle far sur
; passed that of any other man at
that position. His work showed an
aggressive side that has heretofore
been lacking. The quarter-backs
acquitted themselves very credit
ably. Murphy, behind the splen
did interference of Freeman, made
the longest run of the day, while
i Mcintosh's tackling showed some
of his last year's form.
Dole ami Seawright, did the best
work in steady ground gaining.
At fullback Super's punting was
very good, but in line bucking he
was outclassed by Freeman and
Lanagan, both of whom hit the line
: in capital shape.
