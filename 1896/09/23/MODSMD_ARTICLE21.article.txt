The local dramatic club, Sword
and Sandals, is being reorganized
with a view of engaging in active
work during the coming year. The
club contains only four of its old
members —Ross, H J7, Price, '97,

Thomas, '5)7, and Abbott, '98 —the
others having left college.
Sword and Sandals was organized
in May, 1895. Since its foundation
its members have taken an active
part in all the dramatic perform
ances round the University, though
it has given no entertainment dis
tinctively its own. It is known
that there is a great deal of good
dramatic material in Stanford at
present, and it is intended to col
lect all persons with histrionic tal
ents in the club.
