# Tomorrow's Game.
## 
### 
The football teams of the Junior
j and Freshman classes will come to
gether at 3 o'clock tomorrow for
the first inter-class game of the
season.
It is impossible to make a fair
estimate of the com pa rati ve strength
of the teams, as the capabilities of
!'OO are unknown, while it is cer
tain that the's)B team has proved
a very strong combination in past
yea rs.
The probable line-up will be:

'98. '00.
Pauly r end 1 Madden
James r tackle 1 Rusk
Harrington..r guard 1 Perkins
Bigelow center Buntin
Fickert 1 guard r. . . Balentine
Adams 1 tackle r.Cuthbertson
Frost 1 end r Dingles
Dole quarter Murphy
Carle r half 1. .. . Seawright
Fisher 1 half r Brown
Soper fullback. . . . Lanagan
Swaine / , (Burnett
'P • [ .substitutes.. < Bidvvell
Iripp ) v
11 ' ( Nourse
With Pauly and Madden opposed
to each other on the end, and with
such men as James and Rusk to
aid them, we should see few long
gains made on that side of the
Held. Madden has the advantage
in weight and recent experience,
but Pauly is known to be a capital
tackier.
The combination of Madden and
Rusk should he stronger than that
of Pauly and James, as the latter
are lighter men and have not
worked together so long in practice,
while Madden and Rusk have
reputations for splendid work on the
Olympic and Multnomah Athletic
Clubs respectively. On the other
hand, if there is much end running,
Fisher, who will go around Mad
den's end, will prove more formid
able than Brown and should have
a veritable stone wall for interfer
ence. So these two ends should be
virtually equal.
There is little doubt that, of the
six opposing center men, Harring
ton, Bigelow, and Fickert form the
stronger center, although Buntin
and Bigelow should be pretty
evenly matched.
Under any arrangement, '98's
tackles will have a walk-over. On
this account the end men will have
to "go it" alone, with the balance
on the other end presumably on
Higgles', side, for be is a strong
man and Frost will have a very
husky opponent to handle in Sea
w right.
At quarter Murphy has the ad
vantage in experience in playing
the position, but Dole's general
ability as a player in running in
terference and tackling will give
'98 the advantage, especially in de
fensive work.
At fullback Soper will have the
advantage in punting and be aided
in this by his team, while Lanagan,
although superior in bucking, will
be outclassed in kicking.
Comparing the teams as a whole
we find that '98 is stronger in the
halfs, center, guards, and one
tackle, and in the other positions
about equal to its opponents, or
perhaps a little stronger. If Cot
ton should be able to play he will
replace Dole at quarter, where he
has had considerable experience.
Dole will go to half and Carle will
replace Adams, thus strengthening
the team all round.
As regards team work the Juniors
have a decided advantage, their
men being better acquainted with
each other's style of play; and they
are more experienced, several being
Varsity men.
