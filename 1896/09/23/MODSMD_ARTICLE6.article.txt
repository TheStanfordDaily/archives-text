# Juniors Elect Officers.
## 
### 
The Class of '98 held a very well
attended meeting in the chapel this
afternoon for the election of class
officers for the semester. A great
deal of interest was taken in the
proceedings by those present, which
fact only adds to the reputation the
Juniors enjoy as being well to the
front in all matters relating toclass
enthusiasm and loyalty.
The main interest of the meeting
centered around the election of
president, two candidates, P. E.
Walker and E. H. Roth rock having,
been nominated for that position.
Walker was elected over Rothrock
by a vote of 4() to 2(5. For vice
president the result was numerically
about the same, Mr. A. Prichard
being elected to the position by a
vote of TS to 22 over his opponent.
There being only one nominee for
each of the remaining positions in
the gift of the class, the secretary
was instructed to cast the vote of
the class for the respective candi
dates for these offices
The chairman of the committee
on Junior Plugs was called upon
fora report and announced that
the price of the hats had been fixed
at ninety cents and that they could
be obtained within two weeks. The
report was adopted and the com
mittee instructed to canvass the
class for orders. A preliminary
canvass began during the meeting
showed that nearly every one pre
sent was desirous of securing one of
the coveted ''Plugs." On motion it
was decided that upon the arrival
of the hats at the University the
president should appoint a day
upon which members of the class
should appear in them.
The following are the officers
elected for this semester: Presi
