Stanford is proud, and justly so,
of her large number of football en
thusiasts. Never before have we
had so many strong, well-built men
from whom to choose our eleven.
Much interest is felt in the game
this year, as is shown by the large
crowd which gathers every night to
watch the practice games. Let us
keep it up; it's our part in making
the eleven. There is wonderful
power and strength in an interested,
sympathetic crowd of spectators.
Come out and yell for Stanford.
