Skats on the grandstand are not
available to all who go nightly to
see the football practice. This large
attendance is as it should be, and
evinces a proper spirit of enthusiasm
and interest in the men who are to
make our team. However, those of
our number who car. not be accom
modated owe it to the others
to make themselves as little
in the way as possible. It
should not be necessary to stretch
ropes or wires along the side-lines
to keep the crowd back, and no one
should be willing to have the re
buke of the grandstand occupants
in any measure apply to him. Let
a spirit of courtesy prevail, and we
can all see the practice and discom
mode no one in so doing.
