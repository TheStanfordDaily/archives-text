The work of the Glee Club this
year and the peculiar difficulty
under which it labors in tlie way
of securing music suitable for such
an organization, reveal most plainly
the urgent need in which the Uni
versity stands of possessing at least
a few college songs which it can
call distinctly its own. Outside of
two or three productions there is
not a single song within our knowl
edge which has for its object the
perpetuation of the name of Stan
ford and the many associations
which cluster around that name.
The trip of the musical organiza
tions last spring convinced all that
what our college ought to have, and
what people expect it to have, is a
collection of songs typical and de
scriptive of its own life. Other col
leges have them. Vale, Harvard,
Princeton, Cornell, and Brown,
each publish every year a book of
songs written expressly for itself.
W'e are a young college, it is true,
but that excuse can not be urged
forever. If there is not the ability
nor the inclination among our pres
ent members to attempt these pro
ductions, we must depend upon our
alumni for assistance; but the needs
of our University should appeal to
all those who are able to contribute
to her prestige and influence.
