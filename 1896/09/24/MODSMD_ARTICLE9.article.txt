The grounds had been harrowed
ami everything favored good work,
hut the play failed to come np to
the standard of the two preceding
evenings. The Varsity appeared
particularly weak during the first
half and seemed unable to with
stand the rushes of its adversaries,
who rushed the pigskin down the
lield fora touchdown.
Downing, Harrelson, and "Doc"
aided Mr. Cross in coaching.
Of the new men, Freeman, Lan
agan, McGilvray, and Seawright
are proving themselves the best
ground gainers. The two former
are nearly always sure of their dis
tances in bucking the line, while
McGilvray and Seawright are
steady gainers in end-running.
McGilvray shows a remarkable
aptitude in learning the game and
plays a game at end that resembles
that of Spalding.
