# FRESHMEN WIN.
## The Juniors Go Down Before the Century Class.
### 
■
To say that the result of vester-j
day's game was a surprise would
be putting it mildly. The .Juniors,
had been conceded the class chain-1
pionship from the beginning of the
season. Five of the strongest '98 j
players had, it is true, been laid:
tip with small injuries and were!
unable to appear on the field yes-j
terday, but even at that it was be-j
lieved that the beefy '98 line could:
offset any assault of the smaller
freshmen. When, at the kick-off,
the light but active "infants" were,
seen forcing the .Juniors down the J
field, the crowd was amazed and
the Freshmen overjoyed. When
1900 made a touch-down and a
goal after less than fifteen minutes
of plav, the freshmen on the side
lines grew hysterical while the jun
ior yell faded to a whisper. The j
Fre.-hman goal was never once in
danger, while only the Freshmen's!
anxiety to make a star play by i
dropping a field goal prevented the
final score from being doubled.
After the usual delay incident to j
class games the teams lined up, the j
Freshmen looking small and slim
beside their more husky opponents.
The men and positions were as fol-|
lows:

Carle kicked off. The ball was
caught by Diggles who ran it in
fifteen yards. Lanagan kicked,
Chandler overran the kick, and the!
hall striking him in the back it;
went to'9B for offside play. The!
.1 uniors at this point expected theirj
team to force the ball down fora |
touch-down. On the contrary i
there were a series of fumbles which |
])laced the ball in the possession of j
the Freshmen. Lanagan sent a!
long low punt down the field which j
was caught by Dole, and '98's ball j
was near their own twenty-five
yard line. The .Juniors here took a ;
brace and forced the ball down the
field by a series of plays on center i
and tackle, two gains of seven and |
fifteen yards by Fisher being es- 1
peciallv noticeable. Then with the j
hall well in their opponents' terri
tory '98 again fumbled and lost the
ball. Lanagan kicked out of dan
ger, Dole fumbled the catch and
fell on tin; ball on '98's fifteen-yard
line. Dole kicked thirty yards,
Lanagan fumbled, and Fickert fell
on the ball. Dole kicked poorly,
Diggles took the ball from a good
running start, and took it to '98's
five-yard line. M ussent Pleigh and
Bigelow stopped two assauhsonthe
center, hut Diggles went round the
right end on the next down and put

the hall between the goal posts.
Murphy kicked goal, (5-0 in favor of
the Freshmen.
During the rest of the half the
kill was forced up and down the
Held, resting at the call of time in
'98's possession and in '00's terri
tory.
The second half was marked by
livelier playing on both sides.
Murphy kicked off and Dole re
turned, the Freshmen gaining lifteen
yards on the exchange. Then fol
lowed a series of kicks, always to the
advantage of 1900. The beefy '98
•line proved ineffective,for the Fresh
men sifted through their opponents
like water. Another exchange of
punts and Diggles made a run of
twenty-five yards under Murphy's
interference The ball was run
out with a loss of eight yards to the
center of the lield, where Liinagan
tried a field goal but fumbled.
Freshmen held the ball, as they
had lost twenty yards on three
downs. By a clever double pass
Murphy went down the lield twen
ty-live yards. The ball was now
under the shadow of the Juniors'
goal posts but the '98 men held like
a wall. Lanagan tried another
drop kick. It rose fair and true,
but Dole broke through and
was able to block the attempt.
The .1 uniors kicked; Murphy caught
and was downed in his tracks.
I here was another double pass and
Murphy carried the ball thirty
yards to '98's live-yard line, where
it rested at the call of time. The
Freshmen piled on the lield and
lifting their victorious athletes
carried them over the gridiron in
triumph. They had good cause to
be proud, for it is the first time at
Stanford that a freshman team has
beaten an upper class.
The noticeable feature of the
game was the grit and determina
tion with which the Freshmen
played; every man seemed to have
his heart set upon winning. On
the contrary, '98 appeared over
confident and careless, and conse
quently was outplayed, outgen
era 1 led, and defeated.
Had '98 played in better luck
and been able to put its strongest
team in the field the result would
have undoubtedly been different, for
ordinarily '98 has the strongest
class team of any.
The best runs of the day were
made by Diggles and Murphy, who
seemed capable of rounding the
.Junior ends at will. The honors in
kicking fall to Lanagan. It, was
due to this punting ability that the
ball kept chiefly in '98's territory.
In the line Rusk and Ballantyne
played the steadiest game for the
' Freshmen. Cuthbertson, who
played opposite Fickert, did some
capitally defensive work and was
roundly cheered for his pluck and
| grit. His tactics were often of a
! shady character, if not really foul.
The Freshman ends got down the
field on punts in a very speedy
manner and Chandler did some
Clever tackling on end runs.
With such men as Murphy, Lan
agan, and Diggles behind the line
;as a foundation and a little more
weight in the line, 1900 should
have a team capable of great things
—for it would be difficult to find
three better green backs than those
named.

For'9B, Fickert, Dole, and Har-
I rington did the best work. Captain
J Carle was handicapped by un
faniiliarity with his position and
seemed to be suffering with '"that
tired feeling" which afflicted his
team. Although neither side made
great gains through the line, Fisher
I was good for his distance when
given the ball—a thing that sel
! dom happened.
