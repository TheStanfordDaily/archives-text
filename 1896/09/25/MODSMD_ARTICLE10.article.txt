It may he stated as a general re
sult of collective university experi
ence that it doesn't paj r to he a
"dig." By a "dig" is not meant
necessarily the student who works
hard; the term refers to the person
whose only interest is in his studies,
who cultivates no outer activities
other than those bearing upon his
work. It does not follow either that
the "dig"' is the hest student; he is
often indeed decidedly inferior to
students who cultivate to an exces
sive extent their outside activities.
The "dig'' is missing a great deal.
There is as much for development
in general culture in tne number
less associations of college life, the!
people one meets, the enthusiasms
in which he takes part, as there can
he in any collegiate course. There
is indeed more than that here at j
Stanford. We are in one of the 1

favored spotn of the earth, sur
rounded by all the beauties brought
forth by kindly Nature from a semi
tropical climate and a bountiful
soil. There are deer-tracks to be
found eight miles back in the hills;
! ten miles back there is foot-hill
| scenery excelling even that of the
j Adirotidacks, yet how many of us
I are familiar with this region?
j Most of ns know the arboretum and
the Stanford grounds no more.
I People are frequently encountered
who have never seen Eucalyptus
avenue, and know the arboretum
only as a few woods visible from
the quadrangle. Truly "the world
is too much with us."'
