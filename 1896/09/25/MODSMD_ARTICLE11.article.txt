Editor Daily Palo Alto: In
spite of the rain the minstrel show
drew im audience fully as large as
had heen expected. The attraction
was two-fold: the performance was
to he almost entirely hy university
talent, and the proceeds were to go
to the athletic association for the
benefit of the track team. The
show itself was throughout a suc
cess. There were in all about
seventy participants including the
University (ilee Club, Banjo and
Mandolin Clubs, and the Delta
Upsilon Quartette. The opening
part was well presented, Mr. Morse's
solo receiving prolonged applause.
" Trials of a Freshman," the farce
concluding the program, was also
well received. Considering that
this was the first time that the
musical clubs have played in public,,
it showed the activity in our musi
cal circles which has heen going on
for some time. If they continue to
improve as they have in the past,
the rumor that the four clubs may
make a trip through the South in
the winter will soon be taken
seriously. I must not forget to
say that the managers of the show
were able to hand over to the
athletic association nearly $<55.00.
The recorder has just published
the annual table of statistics of the
freshman class. It shows some
interesting things regarding the
number of students and the courses
they have elected. With the pres
ent entrance class the number of
women has fallen off over six per
cent, so that for '00 only thirty per
cent are co-eds. The College of
Social Sciences still keeps up its
large percentage, but there is a
noticeable increase in the Colleges
of Letters and of the Applied
Sciences. All parts of the state are
represented, fifty from Southern
California alone, and many from
smaller places where high schools
are just being started.
As your correspondent is writing
this letter the football men are run
ning across the campus to their
practice, and behind them follow
the track team. Regular work goes
on day by day and the practice has
many interested spectators. The
regular football field is almost
ready for use, the rain having made
the work of preparing it very much
easier. The old track house has
been fitted up with showers and
lockers so that some of the older
players have their quarters there.
Politics are quieter than usual.
The county convention, however,
showed what a force the university
can make itself in local work.
Berkeley had the largest delegation
at the convention, the delegation it
self being headed bv a university
man, the president of our Republi
can club. 'The gold Democrats are
still in process of organization, but
have effected nothing definite so far.
