# Reliance-Stanford.
## 
### 
The Varsity will line up against
Reliance fora practice game at 8
o'clock tomorrow. As this will be
the first opportunity this season to
I judge of the behavior of our men
when in the company of strangers,
! the game should draw a large crowd.
The Reliance team has a high re
cord to sustain and will undoubt
edly put a strong team in the field
I this season. It is impossible to
i learn the line-up of the athletic
club as yet, but it is reasonably
i certain that Racine, Walton, Oliver,
and Frick will play, a combination
which if given any support at all
j is able to make things interesting.
The probable line-up of the
; Varsity for the first half will be as
follows: Williams, center; Carle,
I right guard; Fickert, left guard;
Rice, left tackle; Harrington, right
I tackle; Madden or Diggles, left end;
j McOilvray, right end; Fisher, right
halfback; Dole, left half; Freeman,
I fullback; Murphy or Mcintosh,
, quarterback.
There will be a charge of 25cents
I for the game to defray the expenses
of transportation of the Reliance
team and to aid in the excellent
work which is being done in pro
i viding accommodations for the spee
| tators and players.
