Ti-ik Class of '9<S has completed
its organization for the semester,
and as there is usually little of im
portance taking place in the college
world at this time of the year, it
would be a wise plan for them to
anticipate somewhat the rush of
work in the future. Next semester,
with its entertainments for the
Annual and its arrangements for
the Junior Farce, the Junior Hop,
etc., is to he a busy one for the
juniors. If, for instance, the com
mittee on the Junior Farce were
appointed now, when they have
plenty of time in which to act and
when there is no particular press of
work to occupy their attention, a
great deal of the hurry and confu
sion of the last days of that semes
ter would he done away with.
There is no reason why such a com
mittee should not he making use of
the valuable hours of the present,
and if the matter were brought to
the attention of the proper officers,
there is no doubt that the nec
essary appointments would be
made.
