# ON A RED-HOT GRIDIRON.
## Neither Stanford nor Reliance Scores. 
### 
The Varsity met its first outside
rival for the season when it lined
up against the Reliance team last
Saturday. The game, although
merely for practice, was interest
ing throughout and showed that our
men are putting lip an excellent
game com pared with the early days
of past seasons.
The game further showed how
a small admission fee diminishes
the attendance at a game. While
there were a good many spectators
on the bleachers and along the
lines, still, when the attendance at
the nightly practice is taken into
consideration, one would expect to
see such a game as Saturday's draw
a far greater crowd. The sun may
have been to blame, for his rays
beat down in a merciless fashion
on players and onlookers alike.
It was poor weather for football.
Physically, Reliance was in bet
ter condition than Stanford, but
altogether our men did better work.
Although the game resulted in
neither side scoring, 4he Reliance
goal was threatened several times.
The teams lined up for the kick
off at 8:15 p.m. Reliance took the
bull and Stanford the east goal.
Oliver kicked off for twenty-five
yards and Fickert captured the
ball. Fisher was given the ball but
failed to gain. Freeman punted
for twenty yards and Walton gained
possession of the hall.
Walton rushed through the cen
ter for ii gain of ten yards, followed
bv Lacuna for two yards. Reliance
was given the distance penalty for
Stanford's off-side play. Reliance
pushed Stanford back for small
gains, aggregating five yards, and
then lost the ball on downs. Free
man gained four yards by bucking
the line. Dole and Fisher each
added live yards to this, but Mc-
Gilvray failed to gain. Dole
rounded the end for ten yards
more. Reliance was given the ball
on downs.
Walton was given the ball, but
Mcintosh broke up the play before
Walton could get in motion. Fick
ert followed suit and ruined Oliver's
chances fora gain. Reliance then
tried a kick. The play resulted in
a fumble and Arlett fell on the ball.
Twice Mcintosh prevented any gain
by the Reliance, and Arlett was
forced to punt. Cross's training in
catching was forgotten by the Stan
lord hacks, but Fickert managed to
get the ball.
Dole gained ten yards, but on the
next play an unlucky fumble al
lowed Reliance to gain possession of
the sphere, which they carried
through the line for live yards.
The umpire gave the ball to Stan
ford on a foul. The remainder of
the half was a series of short gains,
fumbles, and off-side plays, and
time was called with honors about
even.
During the intermission both
sides put in a number of new men
in order to give all the advantage
of the practice. Doesch and Piatt
were placed on the Reliance team,
and Lanagan, Seawright, Murphy,
Diggles, C. Thomas, and R. Smith
replaced some of th<' Varsity men.
Murphy kicked off in the second

half and Arlett run the ball back
ten yards. McGilvray gained the
ballon a fumble, Diggles gained)
fifteen yards and Seawright ten on
end runs. The next play resulted
in no gain and Reliance was given
the ball on downs. Stanford then
held the Athletic Club down to a
gain of one yard, which again gave
the Varsity the ball. Diggles
gained one yard, Seawright four
yards, and Lanagan six yards on
a center buck. The latter tried it
again with little success, and Sea
wright carried the ball three and a
half yards. The ball was then
within four yards of the Reliance
goal, third down ami one and one
half yards to gain The Stanford
fullback bucked the left tackle and
managed to make two yards, but
was thrown back and downed with
a gain of less than a yard.
Reliance punted the ball out of
danger, and Stanford received it
again. Diggles lost four yards and
Lanagan punted thirty-live yards.
Arlett returned the punt and Fick
ert received the ball. Lanagan
punted forty yards, Reliance's ball.
Holbrook was substituted for Mc-
Gilvray at end. Reliance found
the weak spot in the Stanford line
and made use of it for short gains.
Robinson relieved Harrington. Re
liance proceeded to cut off great
pieces of the distance to Stanford's
goal, by runs through Stanford's
left tackle, when time was called
with the ball in the center of the
Held. The line-up was:

Time of halves, 15 minutes.
For Reliance, Walton, A. Arlett,
and Oliver did the best work, al
though Oliver did not play up to
his usual form.
Dole and Seawright made the
long end runs for Stanford, while
Freeman and Lanagan made most
of the gains through the line. Mc-
Gilvray's runs were not up to his
usual standard, but this was caused
mostly by the halfback cutting in
and spoiling the j ){tSS.
At defensive work, Capt. Fickert,
Madden, McGilvray, and Mcintosh
made the best showing.
The plav on the Varsity side was
characterized by too much fum
bling — not so much on passes us on
punted balls and halls fumbled by
the other side.
