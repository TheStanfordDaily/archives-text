Thk necessity and advantages of
a good reading-room in Encina
Hall where the best and latest
periodicals could be placed, are so
apparent that it would hardly seem
possible that the Hall is at present
without that very important ad
junct. At present unless the stu
dent in Encina is able to subscribe
for the best periodicals himself, and
there are few who can, he is wholly
deprived of their use with the ex
ception of those found in the Uni
versity library. Hut one goes to
the library for study; and then the
lightest publications, dear to the
college student, are not to be found
there. Everyone has a few mo
ments of leisure, which could be
spent profitably and enjoyably in
the reading-room, laughing at the
latest jokes in the comic paper",
reading the magazine literature of
the hour, or digesting a, present day
scientific or political article. The
student can not keep abreast of the
times without some means of access
to the periodicals of the day. If
such a reading-room were in exist

enee the student could also keep
in touch with other colleges through
their student publications.
l>v the co-operation of everyone
in Encina the necessary funds for
establishing a good reading-room
and purchasing the leading mag
azines and periodicals could easily
be Vaised, and no appreciable bur
den would be incurred by the indi
vidual. The reading-room could
be conducted on stricter principles
than in former years, and be more
valuable in every way. A meeting
of the men of Encina should be
oallecj, 'and steps taken to provide
for this addition to their enjoy
ment of the Hall. A committee
sufficiently large could canvass the
Hall very quickly, and their efforts
would undoubtedly meet with suc
cess.
