# Free Silver, Yes or No?

### 
Dr. Edward A. Hows delivered a
lecture in the chapel Friday even
ing under the auspices of the Bryan
Silver Club, on "Free Silver, Yes
or No?" Dr. Ross was introduced
by A. B. Morgan, president of the

Bryan Club, who stated the needs
of clear and logical debate over the
issues of thÂ« campaign, and of the
necessity of college students in
vestigating hoth sides of the ques
tion of the free coinage of silver.
The following is a brief .outline
of the argument of Dr. Ross, it be
ing impossible to condense his ar
guments.
Prof, Ross favored the unlimited
coinage of silver by the United
States without waiting for the co
operation of any other nation. He
pointed out the great cost of the
maintenance of the present gold
standard. He endeavored to show
that the dollar of the gold standard
was appreciating, and would con
tinue to appreciate two and one
half percent, yearly, thereby add
ing more than five hundred million
dollars yearly to the total debt of
the country. This amount is four
times as much as the cost of main
taining the German standing army.
On the farmers would be laid an
increased burden of sixty million
dollars a year.
He showed that the gold stand
ard injured the whole producing
body on account of the slow fall in
prices. The gold standard would
simply mean a chronic commercial
crisis and hard times. The idea
that the wage-earner is benefited by
the gold standard is as absurd as
the fear of a fifty-cent dollar. The
delusion that free silver would cut
the purchasing power of the dollar
in two is caused by ignorance of
monetary science, for where would
the 1,500,000,000 dollars come from
that should permit twice as many
dollars to be paid away in every
commercial transaction?
Dr. Ross believes that the free
coinage of silver would prevent fall
in prices without the inflation of
the currency and without materi
ally lessening the purchasing power
of the dollar.
