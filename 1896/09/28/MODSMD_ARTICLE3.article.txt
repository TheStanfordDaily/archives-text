# DISSENTERS.
## Rabbi Voorsanger on the Book of Daniel. 
### 
Rabbi Voorsanger of San Fran-1
cisco delivered the sermon in the
chapel Sunday, on the subject
"Dissenters," taking for the basis
of his remarks the Scriptural story
of Nebuchadnezzar and the dissent
of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed
nego.
He began by tracing the story as
outlined in the book of Daniel, and
he clearly put before his audience
the views of modern critics on the
authorship of this book. It isj
clearly proved, according to later
criticism, that the book of Daniel
dates from 1(50 A. 1). Summing up
the conclusions of his study on the J
origin and purpose of the story of I
these three young Hebrews, he
spoke as follows:
There is nothing peculiar, if you
look into the motive back of it, in |
this story of three men in the fiery |
furnace. The time when Daniel •
was written was the time when the
.Jews under "Antiochus the Mud"
were bowed to the ground by his
harsh rule. It was a different
bondage from that of the Babylon
ian captivity. The Babylonians ;
never tried to change the religion I
of their captives, but at this time;
the citizen of Syria must have the!
religion of Syria. The Jews have
always been a peculiar people in
the tenacity of their opinions, and
they were doubly so at this time.
Antiochus tried every means to
break their spirit. The priests were
driven forth, a statue of Jupiter
Amnion was set up in the Holy of
Holies, and all who clung to the
despised faith were put to death.
These were the conditions. The
Jews then were no better and no
worse than they are today. Some
yielded and some refused to obey,
but in the days of Daniel the mu
jority of the Jews were running to j
heathen altars, and were renounc-l
ing faith and principle for peace!
and prosperity. Now, the unknown
author of the book of Daniel tried)
to teach the Jews the lesson of j
faith and principle by telling the I
story, perhaps purely imaginative,
perhaps gathered from a tradition
of his people, of these three Hebrew
gentlemen who would not bow*
down to alien idols.
The unknown author tells us,
then, that when a man stands for j
his God, when he lets his motives |
coincide with the motives of the;
almighty, his God will let no harm
come to him. So he tells the story
of these three Jewish gentlemen who
had lived under the king, become;
his beneficiaries; how they, with
every reason to be grateful to their
ruler, stood forth for their prin
ciples. There they were, but they
stood firm, and their God stood
with them, and took them safely
through the ordeal. That is the
point of the story.
It means the same thing to us,
students of Stanford and citizens
I of California, as it meant to the
[Jews of Antiochus'time. Themes
sage reads: Be true, be steadfast,
believe what you do believe; "to
thine own self be true." I am
afraid that the trouble with the
I world today is that most men do
not know what they believe. There

are so many, for example, who are
willing to let a modern Nebuchad
nezzar undermine the very founda
tions of government. Gentlemen
and ladies, we need you; we need
your strong will, your educated
reason to stand up and declare, "I
will not bow down when the strong
one raises the abomination in the
marketplace." We need men and
women who can say like Luther:
"Here I stand, God help me, 1 can
do no otherwise.
