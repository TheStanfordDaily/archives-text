Mrs. Maud Ballington Booth of
God's American Volunteers, an
American off-shoot of the Salvation
Army, will speak in the chapel
Wednesday afternoon. The time is
not yet announced. Mrs. Booth
will he remembered as having
visited us and made an address on
behalf of the Salvation Army just
before she severed her connection
with that body. At that time she
was generally voted the sincerest
and perhaps the most powerful
speaker we had last year. She
came before an audience which was
at best mildly tolerant toward the
Salvation Army, but she left us
with a warm feeling of sympathy
for her chosen work, and took away
a large number of names as auxil
iary members of the Army. Al
though she is now in another or
ganization she will doubtless be re
ceived as heartily as before.
