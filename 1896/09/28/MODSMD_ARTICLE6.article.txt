Prof. Kellogg formerly has been
obliged to send to New York yearly
for specimens of Corydalix Corvatvx,
a large and extremely ugly water
bug used by the first year classes in
Entomology. This year he at
tempted to cultivate this species,
and with that idea in view sent for
two hundred live specimens and
transplanted them. Only about
thirty survived the ordeal, hut they
are doing nicely. The Cnryrialw is
entirely harmless.
