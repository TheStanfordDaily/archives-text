It seems that some remarks made
l>y the Daily Palo Alto and in
tended as sarcasm concerning the
attitude of the '00 Class and the con
sequent weakness of the upper-class
men have been gravely misinter
preted hy a few of the members of
this promising class. Since the
late football victory several verdant
youths—so evidently freshmen none
could mistake their 'class—have
appeared on the quad swinging
large canes and assuming a swagger
that seemed to say, "We are the
Varsity; let all the earth keep
silence before us!"
Freshmen, we are inclined to
bear your ways with some degree of
tolerance, remembering our own
past weaknesses. For this reason
we will not take offence at your
somewhat arrogant behavior, but
will consider it to have sprung
from your ignorance of the un
written laws of the University.
Take our humble advice and leave
your canes and your '"we-are-the
I'Diversity" air at home. If you
persist in wearing them you will
make t he otherwise promising Class
of 1900 an object of ridicule in
this and other universities.
