# A 						PROTESTED GAME.
## Seniors Claim Yesterday's Game. 
### 
Not si nee the famous struggle be
tween the long and short men in i
'94 has a football contest afforded]
so much amusement to the specta
tors as did the game between the
Seniors and Sophomores yesterday.
It was a poor exhibition of football
throughout. The play resembled
more the antics of a crowd of school |
boys than the work of men, several |
of whom are candidates for the.
Varsity. There were fouls, scraps,
and bickerings galore, ending at j
last in a protested victory for the
Seniors.
The playing of both teams was
decidely loose. '97 had the stronger
line and should have won easily,!
but in some manner failed to makei
proper use of its strength. '99 was
compelled to play a defensive game, j
and, it must be acknowledged, j
showed great pluck.
The teams lined up at 4:15 with j
the men in the following positions:
'99. '97. ;

Freeman kicked off. The ball!
failed to advance the prescribed ten
yards and was brought back for!
another try. Freeman kicked off
for forty yards. Straight caught j
the ball and carried it back ten j
vards. '97, after gaining a few!
yards, lost the ball to Mcintosh on
a fumble.
Freeman bucked the center for j
two yards. The next play netted
'99 nothing, and Freeman again j
advanced and bucked for two yards, i
Seniors' ball on downs. Robin
son went through tackle for ten
yards, C. Thomas advanced five)
yards through the same hole, and,
Rice tried the other side fora gain 1
of two yards. B. Thomas was able!
to make only a half yard, and
Pa rker tackled Robinson before he
could gain an inch.
'99"s ball on downs. The Seniors
poured through the line like water
through a sieve, and tackled West
with a loss of eight yards. Brun
ton tried the end with a gain of
five yards. Freeman punted twen
tv five yards and '97 caught the
ball.
.lost advanced two yards, but his
successor was stopped by the '99
center. B. Thomas managed to
gain three yards before he was
tackled, and Robinson added one
yard. Pice was given the ball, but
was tackled without gain. '97 then
gained nine yards through the cen
ter in three downs, but fumbled
the ball and '99 captured it. There
were some objections, and the ref
eree returned the ball to '97. Rice
gained seven yards through tackle,
1). Thomas went round the end for
ten yards, and was tackled by
Parker. '97 then forced the pig

skin to '99's nine-yard line l>y a se- j
ries of short gains.
'5)5) was then given the hall on a I
foul. Freeman punted out of dan
ger, '5)7 fumbled the catch, but C.
Thomas downed the ball on the
Junior fifteen-yard line. Time
called for first half.
Young opened up the second half!
by a kick-off. The ball struck Wil
bur in the chest and bounded back ;
into '97's territory where '97 |
downed it. five yards from the cen-1
ter. Lawton made two gains of J
one and six yards respectively, but
lost the ball on the second.
'99's ball. Mcintosh, 'it!), tried
the (|uarter-back trick without gain,
and the ball was now given to '5*7
on a forward pass. P. Thomas
punted twenty-five yards and Me- ]
j ntosli caught the ball. Freeman '
gained one yard through the center.
The signal was then given for an
end run by Brunton "Johnny''
lucked the pigskin under his arm
and started for right end; meeting
with opposition there he faced
about and dodged about the field
until tackled by Hoi brook, with a
loss of four yards. If Brunton's
run could have been traced on pa
per it would have resembled the
graphic illustration of an earth
quake's shock. The next play net
ted '99 nothing, and the ball went
to the Seniors on downs.
'97 failed to gain live yards in
the next down and tne ball went to
'99. Freeman punted ten yards:
'97's ball. Lawton lost two yards,
B. Thomas gained three, then four
through (tenter. First down on
'99's ten-yard line. Through the
plucky defensive work of Wilbur,
Parker, and Mcintosh, the Seniors
were prevented from making
the distance, and the ball
went to the Sophomores on downs.
The signal was then given fora
punt but Hoi brook got through and
spoiled the pass. The ball rolled
back and Freeman attempted to
kick, but a '97 man blocked the ball
and '99 downed in its own goal.
The ball, however, was taken back
to the ten-yard line for '97's off
side play. Freeman again essayed
to punt and was successful to the
extent of gaining thirty yards;
'97's ball.
The ball, after changing hands
I several times, at last rests on '99's
I twenty-yard line in '97's possession.
Most is then sent through the line
j for repeated gains. B. Thomas is
given the ball and carries it over the
1 line fora touch-down. Young kicks
I the goal. Score, (> to 0. Time of
second half, 134 minutes. Time
i agreed upon, 10 minutes.
During the last few minutes of
i play there had been repeated cries
j of "time's up'' from the side-lines
1 and as soon as the touch-down had
been made '99 entered a protest on
the ground that the touch-down
had been made after the end of the
time agreed upon.
The facts in the matter were
that the captains hud agreed to
play two halves, the first to last
fifteen minutes and the second ten
minutes. During the second half
Mr. Cross and Captain Fickert or
dered the manager to have the
teams play until one side scored.
This was communicated to the time
keeper. but the players and cap
tains were not notified, and seem

iugly endeavor was made by
the linesman and managers to keep
the captains in ignorance of the
fact that time was up, for even
after the touch-down was made, the
timer said that there still remained
one and one-half minutes in
which to play. Under the cir- I
cunistances, 99's claim to a tie
game seems justifiable, for during
the agreed time neit her side scored. I
Of course the coach and the Var
sity captain should have been :
obeyed, but it would have been
only fair to have called time at the
end of the ten minutes and to have
notified the captains of the teams I
that the game should be played off. \
Even the Sophomores admit that
'97 could probably have defeated
them, but they claim that the game i
should be decided a tie, and they j
offer to default the second game to j
the Seniors â€”a proposition that j
seems but fair.
The majority of students side |
with the Sophomores. It is the i
general opinion that the game i
should have ended within the time !
agreed upon, and the ball taken
back to the center of the field fora
kick-off, thus giving each side an
equal chance of scoring. As it
stood, the advantage was all with
'97, for the ball was well in '99's
territory at the expiration of the
ten minutes.
