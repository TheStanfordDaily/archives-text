Complaint has been made that a
certain place of business in Encina
is kept open on Sunday. The
games of billiards and pool are
open to the students and are at
times patronised by men who are
somewhat boisterous. The regular
business of the establishment is
meanwhile being transacted the
same as on week days. There is
generally a great number of visitors
to the University on Sunday, and
they are likely to receive a wrong
impression of us by. seeing this, as
all other business on the campus is
suspended on that day. Jt is desir
able that the house in question be
asked to close on Sunday.
