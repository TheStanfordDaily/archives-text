Preparations of all kinds for
the Thanksgiving game are being
made early this year. The coach
lias come sooner than usual and
the line-up practices were started
two weeks ago. The Band has al
ready developed into a strong musi
cal organization, and with its
efficient management and enthusi
astic membership ought not to be
embarrassed by the Berkeley toot
ers at the game. But there is one
thing that has been neglected.
This is the selection of a yell leader
and the practice of songs. Our
lack of spirited chants last year
was much commented upon, and a
half-hearted, scattered recitation of
the old yell can not be expected to
inspire men to the effort that wins.
Organization should be effected at
once.
