The opinion seems to be gaining
ground among those who frequent
the football field that inter-class
games have about outlived their
usefulness at, Stanford University.
This season in particular has
proved to many that there is little,
if any, benefit to he derived from
the custom, while the disadvantages
are becoming increasingly apparent.
At such colleges as Vale, Harvard.
Princeton, etc., there is some excuse
for the existence of these games, as
they are participated in by men
who are not candidates for the var
sity football team, but with us it is
different. The majority of the men
who compose our class teams are
valuable and prominent candidates
for the Varsity, who have expressed
their intention of turning out and
trying for the Varsity team. As
the bringing out of unknown and
latent material was the object for
which these class games were orig
inally instituted, they seem to have
fallen short of the mark, as the
same result is accomplished with
out their assistance. Of course the
old argument of arousing class
rivalry and patriotism still remains
true, but most of those who have
watched the progress of events con
sider that that unimportant con
sideration stands almost alone
against the strong array of result
ant disadvantages, such as the loss
of time from practice, and the in
jury of valuable men which these
class games inevitably cause.
