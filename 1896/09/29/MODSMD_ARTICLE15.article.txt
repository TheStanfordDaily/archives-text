Editor Daily Palo Alto: Among
the courses which our English
department offers there is one to
which the would-be lawyers and
speakers habitually drift: namely,
i lie class in Argumentation. Yet
its popularity during the past
appears this term to have been
eclipsed both by numbers and
interest. The reason for this I
think i< not far to seek. The last
few years have witnessed a revival
of debating as an intercollegiate
question among Eastern colleges.
But it has not been confined to
them alone. The movement has
traveled to our Western colleges.
Combined with this general tend
ency, the recent debates between
our college and yours have served
t'i arouse this new interest in debat
ing among us, and hence the at
tention it is receiving.
The presence of this interest is
also reen in the present condition
of the Student*' Congress. Not only
has the membership very much in
creased of late, but the sessions are
attended and conducted in a way
which bespeaks a year of active
work. At a recent meeting the
silver question was discussed, and
there is soon to be a debate upon
the advisability of co-education.
The Argumentation class will be
gin discussions upon French politics
after a few weeks.
The one event of each day which
is now attracting attention is the
football practice. The regular
Held has been finished and is sur
rounded by a fence. Practice for
the past week has consisted of kick*
ingand catching and falling on the
ball, with short, snappy line-ups
and constant change of men. The
line-ups have not lasted more than
ten or fifteen minutes and have been
mostly for triining in quick work.
Large numbers of men are on the
t rack every evening pre pa ring theni
selves for next spring's lield-days.
There are no field-days scheduled
for this fall, so that the interest
taken by the men is (piite unusual.
The plowing of the football field
has seriously interfered with the
proposed class baseball games, and
it is possible that they will have to
be given up. Berkeleyan.
