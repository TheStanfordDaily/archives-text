## 
### 
Nearly all the Varsity candidates
assembled in room 11 quad last
night to talk over plans and to re
ceive the new signals. Coach Cross
opened the meeting by an address
on the necessity of hard work and
enthusiasm, and closed by saying,
"1 had a thousand times rather for
feit every cent of my salary and
win that game than to have it
doubted and go back defeated."
His talk was roundly cheered. Sig
nals were then given out and new
plays explained. The training
rules will probably be presented for
signature Monday.
