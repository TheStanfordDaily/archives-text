# Vandalism in the Library.
## 
### 
There has always been more or less
complaint concerning the depreda
tions on library books by the "pen
cil fiend," but this year the current
political discussion has caused a
great increase of this vandalism,es
pecially in the case of books and
magazines treating of finance. Not

only have some self-appointed
critics put forth their sophomoric
opinions on the margins of able
magazine writers on both sides,
hut in several eases these same
vandals have inserted comments
which are undignified, to say the
least. For instance.one article by a
well-known American economist is
annotated with thei ngenious remark
'•You are a liar!'' while another ar
ticle on the opposite side of the
question bears theoriginal and con•
vincing argument "The man who
wrote this was a, fool."
The library authorities state that
all persons detected defacing hooks
will be severely dealt with.
