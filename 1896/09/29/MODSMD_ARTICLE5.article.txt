# The
						McKinley Club.

### 
The officials of the McKinley
Club are working hard to stir up
political enthusiasm in the Univer
sity. In conjunction with the
Bryan Club the McKinley Club
will erect a speaker's platform to
be used by campaigners of both
parties. On October 28 the debate
which is the result of the challenge
sent by the Bryan Club to tlie
McKinleyites will take place. The
currency question alone will be
discussed. Morgan and Snedden
will support free silver, while
Sheldon and Ross, both of last
year's intercollegiate debating team,
will oppose it. A clear, concise
statement of the arguments pro and
con may be expected.
The Hon. Ben Butterworth and
Senator-elect Koraker, both of Ohio,
are to be in California soon, and a
strong endeavor is being made to
have both address the local voters
here. President Switzer of the Re
publican Club has secured the co
operation of Mayfield, Palo Alto,
Mountain View, Menlo, and Red
wood Republicans, and it is quite
probable that he may succeed.
Those who have heard either of
these great political speakers will
appreciate in advance the treat in
store for us.
Campaign funds are of course a
sine quo nmi. The treasurer of the
club, Ross, '97, has appointed a num
ber of sub-collectors who, in the
next few days, will see the members
and ask for subscriptions. These
collectors are Chas. L. Thompson,
Chris Henne, John Brunton, and
M. T. Pratt. The Republicans in
the faculty will also be given an op
portunity to contribute. They
will be called upon by F. \V. Lake.
