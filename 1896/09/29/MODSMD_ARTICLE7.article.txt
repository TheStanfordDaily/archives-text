# College Notes.

### 
Princeton began training for the
football season September 19.
There were thirty-six candidates
for the first team. The coaching
will be in the hands of Captain Lea
and "Johnny" l'oe, the star half
back of the '95 eleven,
At the initial games of the
Knickerbocker A. C. of New York,
held at Columbia Oval, three
world's records were broken. Rain
had made the track and infield bad,
so the records are the more re
markable. H. S. Sheldon of. Yale
threw the discus 111 feet, 8 inches,
previous record 101 feet, 9 inches;
Thomas E. Burke of Boston won
the 000-yard run in 1:11; and
Jerome Buck won the 440-yard
hurdle race (ten hurdles) in 56 '2-5
seconds.
