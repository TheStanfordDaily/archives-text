Those who attended last night's j
lecture by Prof. Hudson surely
found Samuel Pepys and his diary
extremely interesting. I'rof. Hud
son said, in hrief:
It is a singular hook, and:
holds a place hy itself, not he-j
cause Samuel Pepys was a par-j
ticularly strong man, nor because
his diary possesses eloquence or lit
erary qualities, hut because it con
tains a charm absolutely unique.:
It has simplicity and honesty of I
expression, and brings us into eon-1
tact with the iihiii, and without re
serve into his inward thoughts and
feelings. When Pepys wrote his
diary, a set or deliberate purpose
was entirely absent from his mind.
It is the spontaneous expression of J
his innermost life, and he speaks to
himself and of himself with the ut
most sincerity and frankness. His!
sense of complete security from the
public made possible such con
fidence, for he had no fear that any- j
one hut himself would ever read
what he wrote down. Hence his|
diary is absolutely sincere, in com- j
piirison with which "Rousseau's!
Confessions" are simply a circum
stance. It is characterized by
naivete, remorseless honesty of self
expression, simplicity, and artless
ness.
l'epys was a born diarist, an
ideal chronicler of daily affairs.
He possessed a keen and entire in
terest in men, women, and children,
lie touched the world at an amaz
ing number of points, and was al
ways setting out on an adventure
of a new character. He never let
anything escape him; he knew
everything that was going on every
where a busy, tireless, pleasure
loving man. The book is without
an equal, without a rival in its
line.
Samuel l'epys, the son of a tailor,
was horn in 1 (>->25. He studied at
Cambridge University, and ac
quitted himself favorahfy, receiving
his bachelor's degree in IHOB. When
quite a young man he was made
Clerk of the Privy Seal, and later
a justice of the peace. But re
verses came. His eyesight failed
him, his wile died, and he was im
prisoned several times for implica
tion in the Popish Plot and Jacob
inism. He died in 1708.
On the historical side, his diary
has an immense value, for it gives
us an insight into the life of the
inner court; his habitual self-pos
session makes bare the condition of
things which otherwise he would
never have understood. His work
is testimony to the political and
social corruption of his time; it is
a ''.Journal Antique,'* marked by its
sincerity, naivete, and unsophisti
ca ted chameter.
