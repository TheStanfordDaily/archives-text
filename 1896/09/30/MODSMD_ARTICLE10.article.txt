# Sophomore-Freshman Reception.
## 
### 
A meeting of the '99 Committee
on Reception was held this after
noon to transact business in con
nection with t lie proposed reception
to the freshmen. There is some
douht as to whether the reception
will he given, as the University
authorities have decided, contrary
to precedent, that there must he n<>
dancing in the gymnasium, where
the reception will he held.
It has always heen customary
to have a musical and literary pro
gram, followed by a short informal
dance. Hut the faculty have vetoed
the dancing part of the program,
and the '99 men are consequently
in trouble, as it is thought the
affair can not be a success without
the usual informal dance.
