This year the various societies of
the University are showing much
interest in the intercollegiate and
Carnot medal debates. This is as
it should be. Twice Berkeley has
wrested the laurels from our un
willing hands, and this year she
will try even harder than she ever
did before. Shall she have them?
Her men are already studying
French political history; already
they are thinking and planning
and studying towards that end.
We, too, must act if we wish to
stand any show. If we win we
must work! Those who are inter
ested in the subject should come
out and say so. and then steps
should be taken to give our men
an equal opportunity with Berke
ley's men to be thoroughly well
prepared and trained. It is to be
regretted that the class in Forensics
is not held the first semester in
stead of the second, so that students

intending to try for the debate?
might join. Hut at all events now
is the time to make a beginning.
