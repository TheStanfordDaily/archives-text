# As Seen from the Bleachers.

### 
The attendance, both of players
and spectators, at last night's prac
tice showed a marked hilling off
over that of the past two weeks.
There were harely enough men on
liar.d to make a line up possible.
This is partly excusable when the
size of the hospital squad is taken
into consideration; hut.there are
other players who have been given
suits and are expected to appear
nightly, who seem to think because
they are not placed upon one or the

other of the teams each night that
there is no need of their services.
Consequently when these men are
most needed, and when there is an
opportunity for them to show of
what material they are made, they
are not on ha nd.
The spectators have little excuse
now for absenting themselves, cer
tainly none on the ground of lack
of accommodations, for never have
we had a better equipped field,
thanks to the indefatigable efforts
of .Manager Brown, who, with very
little encouragement and still less
assistance from anyone, has done
all in his power to inaugurate a
successful season.
The preliminary practice last
night was of the usual order and
lasted for about an hour, after
which the teams lined up for scrim
mage play. This lasted ten min
utes, during which time ilie Varsity
scored. The men did not show any
great amount of spirit and received
little encouragement from the
bleachers.
Dole and Fisher, as halfbacks on
the Varsity, showed marked im
provement in their running; Fisher
still runs out too far before turning
in and Dole is a little slow in start
ing. Both made good runs last
night. McCilvray circled the end
in a clever style and once passed
all but Lanagan, who brought him
down bv a neat tackle.
