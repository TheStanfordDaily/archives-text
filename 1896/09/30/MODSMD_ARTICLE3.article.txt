mented ii]u>n hy the college press
throughout the country:
''Besides the Phi Betta Kappa
key there is no mark of honor* at
any of our colleges for students who
excel in other than athletic pur
suits; hut at Williams College they
are going to establish a custom of
honoring students who become fa
mous as debaters, or as banjo play
ers, by some appropriate addition
to their wearing apparel. Perhaps
debaters will be allowed to wear
neckties of the college colors; mem
bers of the glee club, the college
monogram on their dress shirts;
the champion chess player, appro
priately checkered trousers; the
officers of the Young Men's Christ
ian Association, white socks;
and the leader of the junior
promenade might have the privilege
of wearing a dress coat to recita
tions; whilst to members of the
staffs of college papers might be re
served the privilege of keeping their
hair short, as a. suggestion of their
excellence with the shears. As a
matter of fact, the tendency to in
crease the personal decorations,
which seems to be a most insidious
form of gratifying personal vanity,
is not to be encouraged at all, and
to my mind it would be a valuable
lesson in ethics if the regulation
monograms on the sweaters of the
athletes were abolished."'
