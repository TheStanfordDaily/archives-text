# Inter-Society Debate.
## 
### 
The executive committee of the
Inter-Society League met today and
decided to debate on the silver
question. The meeting will be tield
in the ch.tpel a week from Saturday
evening. In pursuance of this de
bate a committee on finance was
appointed composed of one member
from each of the societies â€”Alpha,
Fuphronia, Philolexian, Nestoria,
and Saturday Night Club. They
were instructed to bring in a ma
jority and a minority report. Each
member is to report according to
personal preferences, but by a sin
gular coincidence every member
is in favor of free silver. In view
of the handicapped situation in
which the committee was placed,
the representatives of Nestoria and
Saturday Night Club sacrificed per
sonal feelings and gave a minority
report in favor of the gold standard.
