## 
### 
A proposition is on foot to have
an immense college ratification
meeting in Metropolitan Temple,
Sun Francisco, within the next few
weeks, under the auspices of the
Bryan cluhs of Stanford, Berkeley,
and San Francisco. If the proposi
tion is accepted, Stanford will prob
able furnish three speakers who will
deliver short addresses. The meet
ing will be held on some Saturday
night, and arrangements will be
made whereby a large delegation
may accompany the speakers from
here.
