# AT LAST.
## After Three Seasons of Defeat '97 Wins the Championship. 
### 
A verv large crowd assembled on !
the field yesterday to see the Sen
iors and Freshmen do battle for the !
inter-class championship. If any-;
one counted on witnessing a close |
contest, he was sorely disappointed; J
for the game was very one-sided
throughout. Not only was the i
j»atne one-sided, hut it was a miser
able exhibition of football. There |
was absolutely no team work; but
what was worse, >t ill some of the
players indulged in tactics that I
were actually disgraceful. The!
same spirit of had feeling that was
shown in the '97-'O5) game was in |
evidence even to a greater extent in
yesterday's contest.
The Seniors won the game through
the superior strength of their line
and the individual work of a few of
their men. The remarkable part
of the whole matter was that the
score was not more uneven, for the
Freshman backs could do nothing
because of lack of support from the
linemen. Many attribute the de
feat to the lack of a. capable quar
terback and captain, for Murphy
was unable to play on account of a
broken nose; but it is extremely
doubtful if even a quarterback used
to the position could have done
anything under the circumstances.
The Freshman line was no obstacle
at all to the heavy rushers of '5)7.
The game may prove of some
benefit, however, in that it showed
the weak points in the make-up of
the Freshman team.
It proved, for one thing, that the
rush line must be strengthened in
very quick order unless we want a re
petition of last year's defeat. If '97
could make the gains it did
through center, guards, and tackles,
what could be done by such a team
as Berkeley put forth last year?
Surely the ('lass of 1900 contains
enough beefy men to form a rush
I ine.

The game was called at 4:lo.
The teams lined up in the follow

The game was opened up with a
kick-off of forty yards by Young.
McGilvray caught the ball. Mc-
Gilvray tried for an end run but
lost one yard. 'This was followed
by the loss of a second yard, an«l
then the loss of the ball on a poor
pass. B. 'Thomas bucked the center
for three yards. Robinson followed
suit for two yards, and B. Thomas
carried it over the line fora touch
down, two minutes from the begin
ning of the game Young missed
the goal. Score, 4 0.

Madden and Chandler changed
places, and higgles kicked off for
thirty-live yards, llolbrook caught
the hall, but was nabbed by ('han
dler before he could make any gain.
'97 failed to gain their distance in
the prescribed number «>f downs,
and the ball went to '00. The
Freshmen failed to gain on the
next two downs, and on the third
lost four yards by Straight's pretty
tackle.
'517 was given ten yards for an
off-side plav. Then the Seniors
found the weak spots, and pounded
through "OO's center and right guard
for short gains, aggregating fifteen
yards, before they were stopped.
15)00 at last managed to hold them
down to less than five yards in
three downs, and gained the ball.
Diggles was forced back nine
yards by Arnold, Lanagar. punted
ten yards, .lost fumbled, and I )iggles
fell on the ball Dingles was given
the ball for an end run, gained live
yards but lost the ball to .Jo>t.
's)7's backs and tackles then
started in one after the other and
rushed the ball down the field,
making their gains entirely through
the line.
When the ball had reached '00's
thirty-five-yard line Jost fumbled,
and the Freshmen pounced upon
the pigskin. The ball was passed
back to Lanagan fora punt, but
the 'V>7 rushers were upon him and
he was forced to down the ball in
his tracks. A punt was again at
tempted and resulted in a fumble,
Williams getting through and cap
turing the ball.
'5)7 then advanced to the 'OO's
| twenty-five-yard line, where they
i rested at the call of time for the
first half.
At the beginning of the second
I half, IHggles kicked off for forty
five yard*, -lost caught the ball and
Rusk downed him without gain,
j The rest of the half was a repetition
lof the first. "5)7, principally through
the efforts of .lost, (J. Thomas, B.
Thomas, Rice, and Robinson, forced
the ball back to the center of the
field by bucking the line, prin
cipally between guard and center.
During the rest of the half '97
forced the ball to the twenty-five
| line, where it rested at the call of
| time, by the same tactics, losing
possession of the hall only once,
and then only to regain it on the
I second down. Thus ended the last
of the series of class games, with
! '5)7 as champion of the season
of '5)0.
Straight carried off the honors of
! the day in tackling, lie played a
! star game throughout. In ground
gaining .lost took the lead, and was
I closely fol lowed by Rice and B.
Thomas. The latter also punted
' very well. C. Thomas and Robin
son made some good gains, and
Williams played all around his
j man at center. At guard Young
and Ballantyne were pretty everdy
! matched, but McDonnell had an
easy time of it with Perkins. The
Freshmen backs were unable to
make any showing at all. Diggles
made the few runs to '00's credit.
All candidates for the track team
are requested to meet in room 11
quad at 1:80 Friday. New men
are especially urged to be present.

ten yards, .lost fumbled, and I )iggles
fell on the ball Dingles was given
the ball for an end run, gained live
yards but lost the ball to .Jo>t.
's)7's backs and tackles then
started in one after the other and
rushed the ball down the field,
making their gains entirely through
the line.
When the ball had reached '00's
thirty-five-yard line Jost fumbled,
and the Freshmen pounced upon
the pigskin. The ball was passed
back to Lanagan fora punt, but
the 'V>7 rushers were upon him and
he was forced to down the ball in
his tracks. A punt was again at
tempted and resulted in a fumble,
Williams getting through and cap
turing the ball.
'5)7 then advanced to the 'OO's
| twenty-five-yard line, where they
i rested at the call of time for the
first half.
At the beginning of the second
I half, IHggles kicked off for forty
five yard*, -lost caught the ball and
Rusk downed him without gain,
j The rest of the half was a repetition
lof the first. "5)7, principally through
the efforts of .lost, (J. Thomas, B.
Thomas, Rice, and Robinson, forced
the ball back to the center of the
field by bucking the line, prin
cipally between guard and center.
During the rest of the half '97
forced the ball to the twenty-five
| line, where it rested at the call of
| time, by the same tactics, losing
possession of the hall only once,
and then only to regain it on the
I second down. Thus ended the last
of the series of class games, with

of '5)0.
Straight carried off the honors of
! the day in tackling, lie played a
! star game throughout. In ground
gaining .lost took the lead, and was
I closely fol lowed by Rice and B.
Thomas. The latter also punted
' very well. C. Thomas and Robin
son made some good gains, and
Williams played all around his
j man at center. At guard Young
and Ballantyne were pretty everdy
! matched, but McDonnell had an
easy time of it with Perkins. The
Freshmen backs were unable to
make any showing at all. Diggles
made the few runs to '00's credit.
