I'itEsident Schi'km.w of Cornell
strikes, in the remarks quoted on
another page, a vital point in the
present situation when he says that
this presidential campaign will
bring the universities nearer the

cally only in universities, and the

this feeling is the increased interest
university men throughout the
country are taking in politics.
