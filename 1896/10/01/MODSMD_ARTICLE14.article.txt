The period of accident through
which our footha.il men seem now
to he passing will, let ns hope, soon
come to un end. We can not afford
to have a single man injured even
though he may he the weakest
candidate and may he debarred
from practice only fora short time;
the whole team is weakened and
suffers a loss of incentive to hard
work that would not appear were
the liability to injury not ever pres
ent in the minds of the players.
It is doubtful whether any
efficient remedy for this may he
suggested. The captain knows best

the condition of his men and what
to do for them; and the care arid
attention bestowed upon the grid
iron is certainly tlie best that could
be given. Perhaps the accident
rate has reached its highest point
and will now begin to decline. The
close of the season should mark a
growth in efficiency without danger.
