# No Freshman-Sophomore Reception.
## 
### 
Owing to the faculty's refusal to
permit dancing in the gymnasium,
the '99-'OO reception lias been
declared off. The Sophomore com
mittee took this step only after
long consideration. They give as
reasons the general coldness of all
such entertainments when carried
on without dancing, and the fact
that all former affairs of this kind
have ended in an informal dance.
There is a possibility that some
other affair may be substituted.
