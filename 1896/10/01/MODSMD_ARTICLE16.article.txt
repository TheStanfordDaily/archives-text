The Executive Committee met
last evening in room 11 quad, and
discussed plans for the vaudeville
show on Thanksgiving*evening in
Sail Francisco. Nothing definite
was done, the committee merely
considering estimates of the expense
of giving the show, provided by
Treasurer F. W. Morrison. The
matter will be finally acted upon at
the meeting of the committee next
Wednesday evening. Treasurer
Morrison was given the manage
ment of Stanford's interests in the
football souvenir for the Thanks
giving game.
