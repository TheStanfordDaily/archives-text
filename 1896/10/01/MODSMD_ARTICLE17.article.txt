### 
President Schurmau of Cornell in
11is annual address to new students
spoke as follows of the present
political crisis:
•'This year of is likely to he
a memorable one in the history of
the Republic. There has, I sup
pose, been no more momentous
issue before the citizens of the
I'nited States than that which con
fronts them in the impending
election. It is truly a campaign of
education, and we college and
university people should, therefore,
if for no other reason, be particu
larly interested. We may say
that democracy is a great school;
Ave may say that (iod teaches the
masses of the people ethics by
means of politics, as I think
Wendell Phillips once said —and it
i< at any rate a fact that in meet
ing these great is.-lies and in grap
pling honestly with them and
reaching the right solution, the peo
ple do rise to new heights ol'ethical
and moral attainment. However
momentous and grave thequestions
now pending may be, we may all
feel that in the meantime the peo
ple of the United States are being
educated and are being brought
into closer touch with their schools,
colleges, and universities than they
have been at any time since the
close of the Civil War. This cer
tainly is something to congratulate
ourselves upon, and we can only
hope that if we, together with all
other American citizens, do our
duty, the question will be settled."
