## Stanford Chapter of Phi Gamma Delta Becomes Sigma Rho Eta. 
### 
The local chapter of Phi Gamma
Delta sprung a surprise on the fra
ternity world yesterday by formally
renouncing their charter and form
ing, together with the members of
the Delta Phi club, the fraternity
of Sigma Rho Eta.
The action although entirely un
expected by the college at large
had yet been in contemplation by
the ex-Fijis for some time. Final
action was not taken, however, un
til last Monday night when the
chapter formally withdrew from
the fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta,
and on the next day surrendered
its charter and notified the frater
nity officials of its action. Notice
of the withdrawal had been ex
pected to appear in the papers on
Tuesday morning, but at the earn
est request of the members of the
fraternity in Berkeley and at San
Francisco for delay, and through
| courtesy to them, the publications
were withheld until this morning.
The reason assigned for the step
is dissatisfaction with present con
ditions. The members of the re
signing chapter are thoroughly in
accord with their own alumni, and
; are supported by them in their ac
j tion. The statement that appeared
i in today's Chronicle to the effect
| that Sigma Rho Eta had made
overtures to Alpha Delta Phi and
had been repulsed is not true.
The giving up of its charter by a
fraternity or the transference of al
legiance from one organization to
another is rare but by no means
unknown. About fifteen or twenty
cases are on record, the most fa
mous being the secession of the
Harvard chapter of Delta Kappa
Epsilon and the formation by them
of the "Dickey" Club. Cases are
also on record at Brown, Williams,
and Purdue.
The new organization has the fol
lowing membership: F. V. T. Lee.
