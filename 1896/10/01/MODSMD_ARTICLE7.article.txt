# Band Practice.
## 
### 
There were over twenty men pres
ent at Band practice last evening
and the playing showed a marked
improvement over that of previous
evenings. A large quantity of new
music lr.is been secured, the execu
tive committee having appropriated
twenty dollars for this purpose. Jt
is proposed to test the etticiency of
the men by means of a music com
mittee, so that the ability of each
candidate may be accurately deter
mined.
