# TRACK MEETING.
## A 						Large Number of Freshman Candidates. 
### 
A large number of prospective
track athletes gathered this noon
in room 11 to take steps toward the
organization of work. C. S. Dole
was in the chair, and after the men
bad registered for trials in events
be addressed them on the necessity
of doing good work in order to beat
Berkeley, whose chief strength
against us, in his opinion, depends
on its new men. lie gave a short
description of this year's plan of
campaign.
Manager Brown remarked on the
importance of this year's track
work. Last year we tied Berkeley,
which we did not do any year
previous. Each year we have
gained something. "This year," he
said, "we ought to beat them in
points. At the last contest every
man did his best. Berkeley is
training hard al ready. Their policy
may be doubtful at such an early
date; we should at any rate begin
slowly and not try to get into con
dition too quickly. Track work is
more pleasant than football and
with care no one will hurt himself."
Our prospects for this year are
not very encouraging. We have
lost men in the very lines in which
it takes longest to develop athletic
material. Our champions at the
hurdles, the bicycle, the distance
runs, and the walk are gone. A
sprinter or a jumper mav be picked
up at any time, but it takes work
and time at these events.
We have, then, of last year's team
one good pole-vaulter and high
jumper and fair hurdler; one first
class man at all the runs from one
hundred yards to one mile; and one
fair hundred-yard man; one- fair
distance runner; two fair broad
junipers; two or three very green
hurdlers; one excellent shot-putter;
two good hammer-throwers; and
one good bicyclist. We have ab
solutely no old mile-walker in
sight.
11 will lie seen from this sum
mary how great is our dependence
on the new man. With the material
in the 1900 class rests defeat and
victory this year. The following
are the new men who have an
nounced their intention of compet
ing for places:

yard dash, 11 sec.; J. E. Healy,
pole-vault, 9 ft., hurdles; Geo. M.
Beckett, walk, high-jump; R. A.
Leiter, distance runs.
From this it will lie seen that
the new men are capable and num
erous. No other freshman class
has shown such abilities in this
line. The success or defeat of this
year's team will depend on the in
terest with which they enter into
the work. If they exhibit any
thing like the spirit shown by last
year's team we stand a good chance
of winning.
Work will begin as soon as the
track is put in condition, probably
next week. This year Gymnasium
Instructor Storey is going to put
several squads of gymnasium men
on the track as a part of the regu
lar work.
