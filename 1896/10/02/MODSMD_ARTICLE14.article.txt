It is an almost forgotten fact that
the second-eleven men were prom
ised sweaters last year. Up to
date the promise has never been
fulfilled, and there is the best
chance in the world that it never
will be. We are not laying any
particular blame on hist year's man
agement for this fact; the student
body went heavily into debt last
year and our first duty was to our
creditors. The making of this
promise without the ability to fulfill
it, is the place where the manage
ment was at fault.
