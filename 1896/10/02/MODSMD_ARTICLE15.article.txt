In its present condition the man
agement can take upon itself very
few obligations until we are out of
del>t, but nevertheless one of the
first duties we owe is to the faithful
seeond-team men. There are men
playing today who have almost no
hope of making the Varsity team,
yet these same men come out day
after day in a manner which shames
some of the laggards on the Yarsil v.

They are just good enough to make
first-team men work for their
positions, and their part in a Varsity
victory is little less than that of the
Varsity men. Js it not fair that
we should make some substantial
recognition of their services to our
athletics?
