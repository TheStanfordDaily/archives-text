Attention is called to the fact,
that the Carnot debate takes place
on our campus this year. The first
Carnot medal was won here two
years ago by a Stanford man. The
debate last year at Berkeley was
won by a Berkeley man. Certainly
it is now our turn again.
Every Stanford debater should
take renewed interest in this contest
thi# year. The honor of winning
a medal carrying with it such
associations should be an incentive
to some hard work on our part.
Last year the medal was lost to us
largely through lack of interest
S here. If every Stanford man does
j his part to awaken interest in the
; coming contest we shall surely win.
