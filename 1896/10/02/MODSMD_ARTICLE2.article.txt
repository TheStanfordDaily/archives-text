# Lack of Enthusiasm.
## 
### 
Many of the regular habitues of
the side-lines expressed themselves
disappointed and discouraged after
witnessing last night's practice.
The showing made by the teams
was indeed poor, and ilie play
lacked all semblance of ginger; but
the men on the field received ab
solutely no encouragement from
those to whom they have a right to
look for sympathy —the men on the
bleachers. To be sure the work
was not such as to call forth any
great amount of approval from the
spectators, but it was such as to
show that a proper amount of en
thusiasm and college spirit would
spur the men on to the accomplish
ment of better things. There has
been little evidence of enthusiasm
of late, and it has had its eflect
upon the teams, not only in the
playing but in the number of men
that have turned out. There should
be more on-lookers, more yelling,
and more applause at the nightly
practices.
The players straggled out in one,
two, three order last night, and it
was after 5 o'clock before there were
a sufficient number to till the po
sitions on the teams. Even when
the teams lined up there were
barely more than the necessary
twenty-two men; so that had any
of the players been laid off, there
would have been no one to (ill the
place.
The field, though excellent in
other respects, was a little dusty,
and consequently the men became
easily winded in the scrimmage
play.
The hard work of the evening
lasted about ten minutes and was
preceded by the regular prelimi
nary practice in catching, punting,
snapping, and falling on the ball.
Fisher and Seawright worked up
to their usual standard in ground
gaining but seemed a little weak in
interference and consequently gave
the ends many opportunities to
make star tackles. P. Smith made
the best of his chances and did
some clean tackling. Burnett, a

freshman who played opposite
''Heff" Williams, is a heavy, well
built man, and he seems to have
better success than his predecessors
in holding down his weighty vis-a
vis.
