The initial meeting of the Eng
lish Club was held yesterday.
The topic that occupied the atten
tion of the club was the work of
Professor Cliilds, late a professor of
English in Harvard, and the col
lator of a number of English bal
lads. The subject was presented in
a paper by Professor Anderson, fol
lowed by discussion led by Pro
fessors Lathrop and Fliigel.
Prof. Lathrop said in brief: "1
was a friend of his, being one of his
students at Harvard. 1 remember
but can not describe his grace and
ease of manner, and the charm of
feminine intelligence which charac
terized him. He was generous and
very kind in bestowing small per
sonal favors and advice. He was
often imposed upon, and took pleas
ure in relating some of these in
stances. Physicially he was short
and fat, with long arms, large head,
stooping carriage, projecting blue
eyes, and a shock of sandy hair
upon his head. He used a long
cane which he stamped at every
step. He had many external odd
ities, but was a man possessing a
certain ease of manner, moral great
ness, and sound judgment. His
knowledge was marvelous. Every
thing in English literature seemed
to be at his tongue's end. He was
a philologist and was never given
to generalization; a beautiful reciter
though lie had no chestvoice. The
accuracy of his mind was as great
as the intensity of his feeling."
Prof. Fliigel gave an account of
his work as a scholar in editing the
English and Scottish ballads and
various other works of poetry. It
was due to his efforts that the
Chaucer Society was founded and
the manuscripts of Chaucer pro
cured from private hands.
Prof. Hudson, in speaking of the
newly organized club, stated that
it was the outcome of several in
cidental suggestions which had been
niacle by members of the English
department. "There is to be no
constitution, and no machinery to
get out of order. A secretary and
treasurer will not be needed. The
English department will act as an
advisory board. There will he no
particular membership; all are in
vited. The motives are to get ac
quainted,* have a good time, and to
treat subjects which can not be
brought into classes but which are
nevertheless of much interest to
English students. Meetings will
be held every two weeks."
