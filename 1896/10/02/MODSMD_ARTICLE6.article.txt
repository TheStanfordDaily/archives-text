# New Rules of the Economics Library.
## 
### 
For several years t lie department
of Economics and Sociology has
been accumulating a students' li
brary with the unused balance of
the fees paid for syllabi, etc. The
fee of one dollar which is custom
arily paid for this purpose proves to
be more than sufficient as the
classes increase in size. Instead of
reducing the fee, however, it is be
lieved to lie more profitable to spend
the balance for books needed for
the work and which the University
can not furnish, especially where a
number of duplicated are required.
In this way nearly two hundred
volumes have been collected.
About a hundred were purchased
last year and fifty or more were
added this year. From one to two
hundred more will probably be
added before the close of the year,
thus greatly increasing the effi
ciency of the department.
In order that this growing li
brary may be used to the utmost
without danger of loss a number of
rules have been adopted.
These rules will go into effect
Thursday morning, Oct. 8. All
library permits previously issued
by the department expire at that
time, and must be renewed, if a
continuation of the privileges is
desired.
Permits will be issued by Miss
Chace at the office of the depatment,
room 20, on Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday, from 9:30 to 10:30,
and on Tuesday and Thursday
from 10:30 to 11:30. E. A. Ross,
