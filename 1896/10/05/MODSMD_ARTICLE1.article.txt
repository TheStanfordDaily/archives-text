# STANFORD DAY AT SAN JOSE.
## An Accident Mars the Day's Enjoyment. 
### 
That Stanford day at the San
.lose Fair did not compare with the
Rose Carnival was the opinion of
those who attended. The affair
was dull and tnnie from beginning
to end. In the first place the foot
hill 1 game was very poorly attended,
and the concert in the evening, al
though it drew a respectably large
crowd, was almost spoiled by the
presence of exhibits on the main
floor, which prevented any one on
that floor from seeing or hear
ing anything on the stage. Then
S. M. Cuthbertson, '00, was seri
msly injured directly after the con
cert, and this put a damper on the
spirits of the Stanford delegation
for the rest of the evening.
Cuthbertson was riding a bicycle
alongside of an electric car con
taining a number of Stanford men.
The men in the car were giving the
Stanford yell as they came into
town, and Cuthbertson, on that ac
count, failed to hear the gong of a
car approaching from the opposite
direction, until the car was close
upon him. He became confused
and attempted to cross in front of
the wheels but was caught hj' the
fender and rolled*along for several
yards. When taken out he was
unconscious. He was taken to the
receiving hospital where it was
found that his left leg was broken
above the knee, and that he was
suffering from slight concussion of
the brain. He was subsequently
removed to the San Jose Sanitarium,
and is reported as doing well. A
rumor started to the effect that he
was dead has been proven to be
without foundation.
The practice game between the
tirst and second elevens proved to
he a very tame affair. Four hund
red and fifty not over-enthusiastic
persons attended, and lack of en
couragement and the heat of the
day caused a very tame exhibition
of the game. The first team won,
NO.
As for the concert, those who
managed to hear anything were
delighted at the condition of the
musical clubs. It is too much to
expect a great deal of "team work''
thus early in the year, but there is
plenty of good material, especially
iti the (ilee Club.
After the concert the members of
the (ilee and Mandolin Clubs were
given a reception at the Vendome
by some of the young ladies of San
.lose, (iood music had been en
gaged, and the evening from 1():H0
to 12 was passed in dancing a pro
gram of nine numbers.
