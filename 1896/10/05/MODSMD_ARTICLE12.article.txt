The action of (he Sophomores in
criticizing the faculty in theirclass
meeting this afternoon has been
the subject of some comment. If
the faculty has forbidden the '99's
to give the Freshmen a reception
in the way they deem proper there
is no appeal, and although the 'DH's
may have a grievance, it will do
no good to openly express their in
dignation. On the other hand it
may do a great deal of harm.
The action of the faculty in
discouraging the usual features of
this annual function may admit of
some criticism. Precedent has es
tablished a program for the Sopho
more-Freshman reception, and
when the faculty cancels the im
portant number of the evening, it
is hard for the class to view the ac
tion in silence. The '99 men claim
that no reason has been given for
the faculty veto. They claim that
all the satisfaction they can get is
framed in sweeping and emphatic
negatives. If the matter can not
be adjusted, it seems the part of
the Sophomores to retire gracefully
from the Held without giving vent
to any sentiment which would cre
ate disrespect for the faculty.
