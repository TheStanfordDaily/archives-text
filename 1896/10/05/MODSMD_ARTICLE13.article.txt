An individual who styles him
self "Cato'' turns himself loose in
the last number of the Occident re
garding the entraneeof the Univer
sity into politics. After sweepingly
denouncing everything in sight and
exhausting all the figures of speech
in the rhetoric in so doing, he aims
his pitiless satire at Stanford, and
thanks heaven that the professors
of the University of California are
not as other men, in that they
have publicly expressed no views
on politics.
Our friend of the Occident has
discovered an altogether unique
point of view in this matter. We
have always supposed that the
purifying of the American body
politic necessitated the participation
of university men in politics. In
our blindness we have been under
the impression that "bossism"' and
kindred evils could be remedied
only by the entrance of an intelli
gent class into the administration
of national and municipal affairs.

and that the interest in the presi
dential campaign shown this fall
hy university men was a good
omen for the future of our country.
"Oato" declares the contrary to he
true, lie is to he congratulated,
lie has discovered an iron-clad
principle and formulated a new
opinion. Unfortunately he seems
to he alone in the enjoyment of
that opinion.
