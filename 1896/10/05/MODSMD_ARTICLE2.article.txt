## 
### 
The teams lined up for practice
Friday with the men in the follow
ing positions:
FIRST. SKCONI).
Madden 1 end r I*. Smith
Harrington ..1 tackle r Rusk
Young 1 guard r Bigelow
Burnett center Buntin
(,'arle r guard 1 Adams
Thomas r tackle 1 Rice
McCiilvray. . rend I Leavitt
Mcintosh . . quarter Diggles
Seawright 1 half r B. Thomas
Fisher r half 1 Dole
Soper fullback. Lanagan

The practice was no exception to
the rule which held during the
early part of the week. Il was
slow, loose, and utterly lacking in
anything that could he called inter
ference. To he sure some of the
men on the Varsity managed to get
out for interferer.ee in capital shape,
hut the runner would fail to follow
his interference and consequently
generally he "nabbed"' without
gain. Often a halfback instead of
turning in would run the full
width of the field without making
any advance.
Another point that was notice
able was the inability of the hacks,
especially the fullbacks on the Var
sity, to find the holes in the line.
The linemen made splendid open
ings for the backs, who failed to
take advantage of them. Con
trasted with the poor line bucking
of the hacks, Harrington's gains
were excellent, probably the best
made during the afternoon. He
was sent through the line time after
time and was good for his distances
each time. Part of his success may
be attributed to the men on the
right of the Varsity line, for they
did good work in making holes.
Young, fora new man, made a
creditable showing. He has a
physique well fitted fora center po
sition, and should prove a valuable
addition to the squad.
The ends were again given every
opportunity for making a good
showing and they took advantage
of it by downing the runner nearly
every time. This was a compara
tively easy thing to do, for the
halfbacks, whose duty it is to block
off .the ends, were a failure asinter
ferers.
