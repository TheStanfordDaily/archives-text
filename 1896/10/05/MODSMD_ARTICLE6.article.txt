# THE 						SYMMETRY OF LIFE.
## Sunday Sermon by Professor Show. 
### 
Prof. A. B. Show delivered the
Sunday sermon yesterday, taking
his text from Hev. xxi, (i:"And the
City lieth four square, and the
length thereof is as great as the
hreadth; the length and the breadth
and the height thereof are equal."
10very noble life teaches us how
much a symmetrical human life
may do for every human soul.
This is true by reason of the
divinity in our own lives, for we
know God by the portrayal of His
own divinity in man. Therefore
every symmetrical life is divine,
and the better we are the more do
we reflect God.
The divine life grows in three
ways. First, in the direction of
self-realization. This—the attain
ment of one's best possibilities—is
not selfishness, though it mnv
be easily perverted into it. Self
realization is attained througlvper
sonal culture. When we place the
matter of our personal culture in
the of God's purposes we find
stretched before us a range of possi
bilities of which we never dreamed.
\\ e must not define too narrowly
the scope of personal culture.
There is a tendency on the one
hand to eliminate God from the
consideration of personal culture,
and on the other hand to abandon
those pursuits not calculated to de
velop our best nature to the same
degree other pursuits would.
So the length of our character is
the realization of God's ideal con
cerning ourselves.
Secondly, there is the breadth of
human lives—the line of contact
with other lives. It is a dimension
which heightens our sympathy and
broadens our lives. To miss the
daily instances of brotherly love is
to immeasurably dwarf our iives
and leave them far short of perfect.
Symmetry. We must draw our
inspirations and our soul's suste
nance from the great minds and
deeds about us. Could we but feel
perfect love for mankind, this step
once taken must go on and on and
finally "wander out into the wide
dimensions of the City of God,
within whose walls are blessedness
and peace/'
The third dimension in a sym
metrical life is its height. Resting
on its earthly pillars a symmetrical
life finally draws itself up and up
until it finally attains the heavenly
kingdom.
It is so bard for many of us to get
a right conception of God. We can
understand brotherly love and an
exhortation for personal culture ;
but for God we look about to see
something, to feel some tangible
object. Not finding Mini there, He
seems far off and distant. But God
is not far off: he is the one who
most perfectly understands us. To
have a character perfectly symmet
rical we must reach .out toward
Him. And "we find God because
we want to find Him —because we
want to be like Him."
