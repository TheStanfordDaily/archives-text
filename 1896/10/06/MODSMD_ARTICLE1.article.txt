# The 						Freshmen Meet.
## 
### 
There was some difficulty in get
ting together enough Freshmen for
the meeting today. So many meet
ings are being held that little
interest is manifested; though more
women were present today than
ever before.
President Higley called the meet
ing to order and Secretary Hunt
then read the minutes of the meet
ing last week. The color committee
reported. It was then moved to
have an informal ballot and choose
the class color from the two receiv
ing the highest vote. White and
gold were finally adopted.
The committee on class-yell next
submitted its report. Its live yells
were placed on the hoard beside the
famous old "Rah! Hah! Ru." The
old yell was nearly unanimously
chosen.
It was moved and carried to
appoint a freshman from San Jose
to visit S. M. Cuthbertson, '00, who
was so seriously injured at San
.Jose last Saturday.
The Freshmen, as usual, all
wanted to talk at once, and suc
ceeded as well as might lie ex
pected. The president rapped for
order until he was red in the face,
but oratorical genius was not to be
downed; and when all had been
heard the meeting adjourned in
good order.
