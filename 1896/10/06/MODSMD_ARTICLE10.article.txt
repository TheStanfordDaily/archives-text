Editor Daily Palo Alto: The
notion in regard to the annual
Freshman - Sophomore reception
makes pertinent some inquiry into
the basis of the so-called precedent
of having dancing close the re
ception.
When the present senior class as
sophomores were making arrange
ments to "receive" the then fresh
men. the writer was one of the com
mittee in charge. When permis
sion to use the gym. Was given l>y
the faculty representative, it was
with the express understanding
that there should be no dancing.
Following the lead of '9(5, we hired
an orchestra to furnish music, not
for dancing but presumably for the
edification of our guests and our
selves. The natural thing resulted.
Two or three conspirators started
to da nee and the reception resolved
itself into a quasi-hop.
Last year of course "precedent
had established that there should
be dancing at the Freshman-Soph
omore reception," and without an)'
permission from the faculty repre
sentative, dancing was indulged in.
We are used to the phenomena of
precedent-making here, hut it is
difficult for one to understand just
how the precedent above discussed
came into existence. Its basis is
wholly imaginative.
As for the reception itself, it has
much in its favor and should not
be discontinued for trilling reasons.
Anything which tends to promote
better acquaintance among lower
classmen is especially to be com
mended, and such things contribute
largely to the building up of a
distinctly Stanford spirit and life,
which of course is much more im
portant than this petty discussion
as to whether the Sophomores and
Freshmen shitll lie allowed to dance
an hour or not. Senior.
