Thk football management has
this year shown a commendable
spirit in the care of tlie football
Held, thereby rendering the liabil
ity of injury to any of our athletes
considerably less than heretofore.
Accidents have happened, but they
can not be laid to the condition of
the field. A praiseworthy feature
of this year's management is the
almost, daily watering of the field.
This laying of the dust is absolutely
necessary if the men are to obtain
any degree of endurance and wind.
To win, our team must have the
strength and endurance to play
steady, hard football throughout
the entire game. Anything which
tends to produce this result is tie
serving of great praise.
