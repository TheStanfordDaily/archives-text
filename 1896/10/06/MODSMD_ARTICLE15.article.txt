There h:is I>eon considerable
complaint heard lately regarding
the Co-operative store. The com
plainants have forgotten, evidently,
to compare the conditions now ex
isting with those that would exist
if the store were run by private en
terprise. Almost all of the discon
tented parties confine their argu
ments to drawing comparisons be
tween our Co-op. and that of such
institutions as Harvard, Yale,
Berkeley, or Pennsylvania.
The complainant*} must remember
ihat the conditions here are differ
ent from those at almost all other
universities. We are comparatively
isolated; books and other articles

which can be obtained, at no cost
for transportation, at a university
situated near a great city, must be
sent for and obtained by the slow
and often expensive method of tlie
mails and express companies.
Moreover, tins very isolation puts a
limit both upon the range and vol
ume of the work of this store.
Were the co-operative plan to be
abandoned, the rise in prices would
soon convince the complaining
students of the usefulness of our
present system.
