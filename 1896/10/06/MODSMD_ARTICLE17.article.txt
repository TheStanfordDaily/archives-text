# New Harvard Scholarships.
## 
### 
Until this year all of the scholar
ships offered by Harvard College
have brought with them pecuniary
aid and have been intended chiefly
for men who were in need of such
aid. Heretofore there has been no
such distinction as a scholarship
fora man who was not in need of
money. At the close of the last
college year, however, it was voted
by the faculty and confirmed by
vote of the corporation to establish
purely honorary scholarships, open
as honors to men who do not need
financial help. They are called
the John Harvard Scholarships
and are to be granted only to those
seniors, juniors, and sophomore*
who may be considered "worthy of
very high academic distinction."
They will be conferred as a matter
of course, without application.
It is intended that the holders of
John Harvard Scholarships be
grouped in the university Catalogue
and elsewhere with the most dis
tinguished holders of other schol
arships. Holders of less important
scholarships are to appear in an
other list; and holders of special
scholarships given on special claims,
such as residence in a particular
town or descent from a particular
person, will constitute a third list.
A similar system of fellowships,
called the John Harvard Fellow
ships, was introduced a year ago
into the Graduate School, but has
only just been put on a permanent
basis. John Harvard Fellowships
can be granted only to members of
the Graduate School, resident or
non-resident. The holders will be
few in numbers, and will be recom
mended by the respective depart
ments in which their work lies. —
