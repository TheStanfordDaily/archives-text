•J. M. Switzer, manager of the
freshman football team, received a
telegram from Belmont this after
noon stating that their team would

team at 8 p.m. A game had been
proposed for the 14th, but
Belmont could not play on that
day, so they wished to play tomor
row. As our freshman team is de
moralized by the loss of one tackle,
one guard, and one halfback on ac
count of injuries, and as Captain
Murphy is himself unable to play,
word will be sent to Belmont not to
come, and a game will be arranged
for some later date.
