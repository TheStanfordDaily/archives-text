# From Gridiron to Oval.
## 
### 
Put twenty-one men appeared
for practice on the gridiron last
evening because of a mistaken
order issued early in the day, stat
ing that there would be no practice.
This order was rescinded, but not
in time to notify all of the can
didates.
With so few men on hand it was
impossible to line up, and the time
was devoted to light practice in
catching, punting, snapping, and
stalling, in all of which Mr. Cross
took an active part.
Shortly after five o'clock the en
tire squad adjourned to the cinder
path and were given a stiff wind
test by being sent on a mile run.
The men in general showed poor
condition, considering the length of
time they have been at work. Some
dropped out on the second lap, and
but few of the starters completed
the entire mile.
A noticeable fact in the work of
late is that the men show, with
very few exceptions, an utter lack
of enthusiasm. Not only in the
matter of getting out late is this
feeling evident, but the candidates,
even when they are supposed to l>e

playing hard, seem not to have
their hearts in their work; they ap
pear to look upon the practice as
something compulsory, to he shirked
and avoided at every opportunity.
Mr. Cross has complained again
and again of this lack of enthusi
asm, and it is only just to him as
well as to the name of the Univer
sity that every man should throw
his whole soul into his playing at
the practice games.
