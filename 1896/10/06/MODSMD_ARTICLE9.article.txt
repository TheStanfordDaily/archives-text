# Has Little to Say.
## 
### 
President Jordan returned to the
University from San Francisco this
morning. In an interview he said
that beyond what had appeared in
the daily papers from time to time
he had little to say concerning the
results of his trip t<> Behring Sea
as a member of the United States
Seal Commission. He is now
busily engaged upon his report to
the government, and if it sees fit to
make the contents public, a
full digest of the findings
may be had. The expedi

tion accomplished what it .set out
to do, and achieved very important
results, which, when made known
to the authorities at Washington,
are apt to assume great interna
tional significance. The distance
covered by the party was 6,200
miles on water, besides several long
journeys on land. Dr. Jordan took
a hundred or so views of the seal in
bis native home and waters, and
when mounted on lantern slides
they will be a prominent feature of
a series of lectures which he will de
liver on the subject.
