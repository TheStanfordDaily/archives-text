# TUESDAY EVENING LECTURE.
## Prof. Goebel on the Poet Heine. 
### 
"Heinrich Heine as a poet" was
the .subject (if Dr. Goebel's lecture
last night. Dr. Goebel, in short,
said:
A few years ago a number of
Heine's admirers in Germany came
to the conclusion that the time had
arrived when a monument should
be erected to the memory of their
favorite poet. Before it was finished
however, the poet's native city re
fused to accept the generous gift,
and after being offered to other
cities of Germany, with the same
result, it was finally purchased by
some Americans travelling in Ger
many and brought to this country,
where the money was to be raised
by subscription. This effort met
with lit Ile success, however; even a
place for the statue in Central l'ark
was refused. The result was that
it was purchased by a rich brewer
and now adorns a second-rate sea
side summer resort, in the vicinity
of New York.
The story of this monument
which went begging in two contin
ents fora suitable resting-place, is
characteristic in more than one re
spect of the position which Heine
occupies in the history of German
literature. For this position is
today by no means settled, despite
the fact that forty years have passed
since the poet was laid to rest.
While his admirers extol him to
the skies and place him as a lyric
poet next to Goethe, his opponents
can see in him naught but a clever
versifier who obtained his fame sur
reptitiously. Among his opponents
are not only those who condemn
Heine for patriotic or religious rea
sons, or who despise him as a vile
character, but there are also some
of the foremost critics of Germany.
Next to Goethe he is probably
the best known and the most pop
ular of German authors among the
English-speaking nations. When
Heine made his appearance in lit
erature the Romantic school pre
dominated everything in Germany,
and as one of Heine's teachers was
the acknowledged head of Roman
ticism, it is no wonder that we find
young Heine an ardent apostle of
that gospel. The character of his
imagination is romantic through
out; it is the imagination of fairy
land that operates with loud, glar
ing colors, of which the "'burning
roses in the moonshine" furnishes a
striking example. For this reason
Heine is at his best in such songs
as "The Lorelei," which are fairy
tales themselves. But while he
was lacking in plastic power, his
command over the poetic form in
language, metre, and rhythm is
simply perfect.
