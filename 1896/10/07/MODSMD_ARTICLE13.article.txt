When a football practice has to
be kept waiting almost an hour be
fore enough men come out to make
two teams, it looks as though some
of the enthusiasm with which
we started out this year has been
oozing away. Old students have
not forgotten the fact that a similar
state of affairs occurred in the mid
dle of last season,a nd that our team's
failure to make the showing of
which it wascapablein the Thanks
giving game was largely owing to
this fact. If we loose a game
through the individual inferiority
of our men, such a defeat may be
excusable; the defeat that is dis
graceful is the one that is brought
about by listlessness and indiffer
ence.
