So much has already been said
and written in regard to the sub
ject of bicyclists vs. pedestrians
that it would seem entirely un
necessary to say any more. How
ever, the fact remains that contin

ual dropping will iit. last wearaway
the stone, and it really does take a
great deal of talking to produce any
much-desired result. If pedestrians
do not wish to lie in constant dan
ger of accident, it would be a very
wise move upon their part to find
out which is their side of the road
and stick to it. It is exceedingly
annoying to a bicyclist to meet a
pedestrian who changes his mind
several times before allowing the
rider to piiss, and such people seem
to be quite ignorant of the fact that
such maneuvres on their part are
dangerous. Now if people would
onlv take notice that it is custom
* â™¦
arv to pass a wheelman upon the
right and allow him to pass from
behind on the left, much unneces
sary inconvenience and a great
many accidents would be averted.
