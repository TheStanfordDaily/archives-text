# The
						Butterworth Rally.
## 
### 
As formerly announced, Congress
man Benjamin Butterworth of Cin
cinnatti will be heard here next
! Saturday afternoon, under the
auspices of the University Republi
can Club. It was at first expected
i that the rally would be held in the
! quadrangle, but the emphatic re
j fusal of the faculty to permit any
I political meetings on the campus
lias caused the club to make a
j change in its plans. As now
arranged, the rally will be held in
t Palo Alto under the joint auspices
|of the University Republican Club
and the Palo Palo McKinley Club.
As this will be the only time that
Butterworth will speak in this sec
j lion, a large attendance is expected
! from the surrounding towns.
Congressman Butterworth has
I long been known in political cir
cles as one of the leaders of his
: party in Ohio, and as a prominent
I orator. He served several terms as
| congressman for his district, and
I occupied a prominent situation in
the House. Such is the mutability
of human fame that we know him
mainly as the father of Berkeley's
coach.
