# Choral Society Wants Members.
## 
### 
The Stanford Choral Society will
rehearse as usual on Thursday
evening from 7:80 to 9. All who
are desirous of becoming members
are earnestly requested to be pres
ent. The Chorus needs especially
basses and ladies' voices. If the
Chorus is to continue it is absolutely
necessary that there be a member
ship of 150 or more, to pay the run
ning expenses and complete the
purchase of the piano now in the
chapel, and also to handle in a sat
isfactory manner the music now be
ing studied. That a full Choru* is
able to do this work is sufficiently
attested by the concert of last se
mester.
