# More Snap.
## 
### 
The players were again very late
turning out for practice last night,
but when the teams did line up
they played with considerably more
snap than heretofore. Altogether
the work showed improvement, al
though far too much confusion and
fumbling were caused by ignorance
of the signals.
The players derived about as
much encouragement from the
small crowd of spectators present
as they would have received had
they played before a row of empty
bleachers; there was no show of en
thusiasm. If the present state of
affairs is prolonged, we shall have
forgotten by Thanksgiving that
there ever was a Stanford yell. If
the seniors will not take the lead
and set the example to the newer
classes, surely '98 should be able to
put a sufficient number of strong
lunged''rooters'' on the bleachers
to put to shame the older class.
Following is last night's line-up:
FIRST. SKCOND.
! Madden 1 end r Tripp
Harrington .1 tackle r.. . . Robinson
Young 1 guard r Bigelow
Williams center Buntin
Carle r guard 1 Burnett
Rice r tackle 1 Rusk
McGilvray. . r end 1 Leavitt
Mcl ntosh.. . . quarter Cotton
, Seawright. . ..1 half r Parker
Fisher r half I. . ..B. Thomas
Soper fullback Lanagan
Cotton was out for the first time
in several weeks, and his work was
excellent, especially in tackling.
Parker, halfback, followed Cotton
closely in tackling. Fora new
man he does excellently good work;
his tackling is surpassed by few on
the squad. Rusk, another second
eleven man, is the last of the trio
which did the showiest work last
night. He was in every scrimmage
and displayed a great amount of
"ginger."
The Varsity line, as a whole, was
far stronger than the opposing line,
and consequently the second team
backs could do little in gaining
ground. McGilvray, Seawright,
and Fisher passed the ends a num
ber of times for good gains. II ar
] rington again did the best line
j bucking. The line gave the backs
i every opportunity to make good
I gains by bucking, and Harrington
| was the only one that took proper
advantage of bis chances. Soper
i made a few good gains, but showed
poor form in buckingâ€”hitting the
line in a standing position and sel
dom finding the hole.
