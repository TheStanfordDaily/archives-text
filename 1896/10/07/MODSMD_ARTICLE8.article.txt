Editor Daily Palo Alto: In re-'

I regarding the Co-operative Store, J
| beg leave to submit the views of the
I persons who complain that the
store is a comparative failure and
I does not meet the requirements of
J such an establishment. I am well
aware that co-operation was one of
J the most cherished ideas of the
j founders of this University; but ii
I must be admitted that, from the
: practical side at least, co-operation
| at Stanford has not been a great
I success. The dormitories were
j originally run on this plan, but are
now in the hands of private indi
viduals. Last year the only rem
nant of the system was the appoint

meiit of n committee to keep the
accounts ami collect a breakage tax
of $ 1.50 per student, charged alike
whether one entered the halls in
September or January. The re
ceipts given bore the promise to re
fund the balance at the end of the
month in which the student should
leave the hall. Requests for this
refund have been refused, and the
recent communications through
these columns calling fora state
ment have been met with that si
lence which is ominous.
As to the Co-op. itself, there ex
ists a very peculiar situation. It is
on a firm financial basis, and in
charge of a very efficient manager,
but it is next to impossible fora
holder to sell a share for much
more than one half of the par value,
notwithstanding the fact that there
are about seven hundred shares and
property to the value of $3,700. It
is stated that less than one half of
the members are now in the Uni
versity and that four of the nine
directors are also away.
The fact that students do not
wish to become members of the as
sociation and prefer to buy books
of outside parties proves that the
time is ripe for an improvement.
This year especially there seems to
have been a tendency to purchase
drawing instruments, law books,
and supplies from other sources.
If something is not done the Co-op.
is liable to evolve into a private in
stitution, with every share held
outside of the University.
The idea <>112 the promoters was to
bring about a more satisfactory ar
rangement by buying books from
publishers and jobbers and sell
them at enough in advance of cost
price to pay running expenses and
no more. It was understood that
non-members would be charged ten
per cent, more than members, and
probably from five to ten per cent,
below the San Francisco prices.
The general impression is that
members and everybody have been
paying the regular price and that
in consequence the last year's busi
ness rounded up with a large sum
on the profit side.
The sales of the Harvard co-op.
last year aggregated $3(50,000. A
similar concern was organized last
fall at Cornell which paid a divi
dend of seven per cent. This year
they will attempt to handle about
everything a student uses. During
the winter recess they expect to
send the manager to Harvard* to
study the methods in vogue in that
university.
The object (if this article is to
provoke a discussion that may re
sult in a co-op. of which every stu
dent will desire to be a member,
and which shall be an example of
Senator Stanford's idea of associa
tion. 11.
