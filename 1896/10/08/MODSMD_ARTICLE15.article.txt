It seems necessary once more to
protest against the unceasing
movements of vehicles in the neigh
borhood of the quadrangle during
recitation hours. The continual
rumbling of the sprinkler lias made
both recitations and lectures al
most impossible in some of the
eastern rooms this week. The
strain on the nerves of the professor
in such cases must he considerable,
and it is safe to say that the atten
tion of most students is not especial
ly close. There is probably no law
which can prevent a man from
running a noisy cart about the
quadrangle, but a request from the
proper persons might have some
effect.

Anton Schott, the greatest dra
mafic singer of (iermany, will lie
with us tomorrow evening. To the
old students he has already become
a friend and favorite by his appear
ance here last year, and for them
it will he but a recalling of past en
joyment. For the new students it
is a treat to be looked forward to,
not only for the artistic enjoyment
to be derived,but for the opportunity
of corning in contact with the mas
terpieces of the greatest composers.
The lyrics anil ballads of Hcrwegh,
tieihel, Hblty, and others, which
Mr. Schott sings, and out of which
the Wagnerian opera grew, needed
only the addition of music to reach
the stage of perfection. The style
of this music, as well as the inter
pretation of it, is bound to have its
influence on every listener, and no
student can afford to sacrifice such
an opportunity. The proceeds of
the concert will be used to pay off
the debt still incumbent on the
llildebrand Library, and if for this
cause alone, it should be liberally
patronized.
