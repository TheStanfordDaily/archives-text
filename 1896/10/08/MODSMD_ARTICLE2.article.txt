# Silence Reigned Supreme.
## 
### 
The crowd on the bleachers at
last evening's football practice pre
served a death-like silence through
out the entire game. It is evident
that the football enthusiasts of
former years have become too much
accustomed to watching the prac
tice to become the least bit excited.
It is certainly disappointing to see
line plays pass by without any ap
preciation from the crowd on the
bleachers. Sometimes the nearest
approach to a show of interest conies
in the way of humor at some un
fortunate blunder made . on the
tieid. Jeering and joshing from
the grandstand are not much en
couragement to the players, though
an honest appreciation of his ef
forts, if shown, will do a man much
good and stimulate him to a
still further show of energy.
The Mayfield and Palo Alto urchins,
that, nightly assemble on the field
to scamper after and light over the
pigskin, receive more encourage
ment at times than do the men.
Something is wrong here, and a
change should be instituted, even if
it takes another mass meeting to
do it.
The game itself showed a marked
improvement in (he style of play.
The practice was called fora later
hour than usual and the men were
out on time. The condition of the
weather was such as to instil plenty
of life into the men and they played
with a vigor which has been want
ing of iate.
The Varsity's efforts were de
voted almost entirely to line buck
ing and punting, in which it made
an excellent showing, proving that
our line is far superior to the backs,
as the hacks can do little ground
gaining except when supported by
the line.
The Varsity ends proved weak
last night, allowing the second
eleven backs to round them again
and again. In fact, Dole made the
prettiest run of the season round
the end. He gained fully thirty
five yards, passed nearly all the
Varsity tackles without interfer
ence, and was finally stopped by
.Mcintosh in a neat manner.
A noticeable fault in the work of
the teams is the failure to follow
the ball. The majority of the men
on the teams stand in their places
after the play and wait till the ball
is downed, then shamble up in a.
lazy manner only to repeat the
process on the next down.
Harrington keeps up his good
work :ti tackle, lie is fast proving
himself trie most energetic man in
the line. Clemans, a brother of

the ex-Stanford halfback, played
fullback on the second team and
did some capital punting under
trying circumstances.
In the second half the second
eleven w.ts reinforced by the addi
tion of several men. The Varsity
was thus prevented from making
the headway that it did in the first
half. Furthermore, Bigelow cap
tured the sphere after one of Soper's
ineffectual attempts to catch a
punted ball, and tore down the
field fora touchdown.
•lost, who has made a record for
himself on the ('lass teams, was a
valuable addition to the second
eleven last night. Ileplaysa hard,
conscientious game, and is a sure
line hucker.
Williams at center is putting up
a remarkably strong game. He is
handicapped considerably by the
new style of pass, which gives
trouble to the quarter as well, but
when he overcomes this by practice
he will undoubtedly put up a better
game than last year. Dole in every
way outplayed the other halfbacks.
Not only did he make a long run
hut he played a good all-round
game. Soper played his usual
game; he punted well. Parker did
some line tackling.
