Anton Schott's presence here to
morrow night will he heartily wel
comed hy a II who have had the plea
sure of hearing liiui. The reason for
this repeated opportunity is that
Mr. Schott is at present in San
Francisco training a number of
promising voices, at his own ex
pense, for the purpose of making
them representatives of his art.
Mr. Schott's intention is to found
a school of singing and dramatic
art in Washington, to which pur
pose he is devoting all his tune and
money. His style of singing and
teaching combines the I test of the
old Italian school with the dra
matic school of Wagner.
Schott's greatest successes are
probably those made in Denmark
and Italy. At Copenhagen he gave
a ''Lieder Abend." Three times he
had to repeat Siegmund's love song
of Wagner's Walkyre; the Queen of
Denmark, the well-known ''mother
in-law of half Europe,'' personally
leading the applauders. Ail the
papers declared that never before
had a male artist, not even Liszt or
Kubenstein, achieved such a tri
umph.
In Italy there is still an envious
feeling on account of Germany's su
periority in music. Schott brought
Wagner to all the principal cities
in India and met with grand suc
cess. This nation of singers appre
ciated Schott immediately and he
was received most heartily.
