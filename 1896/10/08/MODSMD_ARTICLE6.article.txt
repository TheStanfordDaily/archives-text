# Stanford Song-Book.
## 
### 
A movement, has been inaug
urated l>y the Glee Club looking to
the publication of a book of songs
for the Glee, Mandolin and Banjo
Clubs to be distinctive of Stanford
and its life. The plan is to have
the work undertaken by the student
body through a committee appointed
for the purpose. All the songs that
have been written will be gat Ire red
together, and new ones solicited; it is
possible that some inducement may
be offered to incite the Stanford muse
to action. Prof. Pnsmore will have
supervision of the work and willar

range the songs for the various
clubs.
The lack of real Stanford music
has long been deplored by the stu
dents as a whole, and it now seems
as though we were at last to have
something that we can call our own
and which will typify the spirit
and associations which make us
(Stanford students.
