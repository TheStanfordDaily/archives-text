# A 						RAILROAD WRECK.
## A 						Serious Smash-Up Near Palo Alto. 
### 
The usual dull and even tenor of
our ways was interrupted last night
by a serious railway accident. At
2 a.m. today a fast freight from San
Jose to Salt Francisco ran into live
freight cars on the main track be
tween Palo Alto and May field and
both cars were reduced to splinters.
Engineer Haggerty of the freight
train was killed outright, his body
being mangled almost beyond rec
ognition, while the fireman and a
brakeman were injured, the former
fatally. It was a terrific smash-up.
The Jive cars that caused the acci
dent were actually thrown back
clear over the engine of the freight,
and both trains are literally re
duced to splinters. The fact that
the freight was lightly loaded and
was making fast time accounts for
ihe force of the collision.
The freight cars lying by the
freight depot were switched off from
the main track this morning a
few minutes before 2 o'clock t<> let
the freight pass. The switch here
has quite a down grade towards
Mayfield, and live cars in some
manner got loose from the rest of
the train and started down the
switch. They were not noticed, and
as the switch is self-adjustable, they
went immediately upon the main
t rack.
11 is difficult to learn at present
just who is responsible for the
wreck. Several tramps were driven
out from underneath the cars at
about 1 o'clock a.m , and a conjec
ture is that they in revenge un
coupled the cars. The tramps were
caught this morning and are safely
locked up in the Palo Alto jail.
Another rumor places the re
sponsibility upon the men who were
doing the switching. It is said
that a man was not sent with the
cars while they were being switched
off, and that consequently the
brakes were not put on. Then,
owing to the down grade, the cars
started, passed the automatic
switch, and rolled down the main
1 rack.
Most of the students viewed the
wreck at one time or another this
morning. It was worth it in a Way,
for few railroad smash-lips show
such utter demolition. A force of
men was immediately set to work
clearing awav debris and laying a
temporary side-track around th M
wreck. The morning trains were
from an hour and a half to two
hours late today.
