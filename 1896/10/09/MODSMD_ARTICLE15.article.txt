We nre glad to note that the
good sense of California's student
body, as ex pressed in the Berkeley an,
does not support "Cato" in his pro
miscuous railing against the en
trance of his alma mater into poli
tics.
The Berkeley an boldly takes the
tield against "Cato," declaring that
searching for political truth is dis
tinctly the duty of a university,
and deploring the inability of
Berkeley professors to express their
views, owing to the dependence of
U. C. on the state. The writer
doses his able article by a quota
tion from Carlyle so pertinent to
the situation that we requote it:
"It is the riddle of the Sphynx.
Of each man she asks, with terrible
significance: 'Knowest thou the
meaning of this day? What thou
canst do today, wisely attempt to
do.' . . . With nations it is as
with individuals. Can they read
the riddle of destiny? This English

nation —will it get to know the
meaning of itx strange, new today?
Is there sense enough extant in our
twenty-seven million heads to « 1 is-,
cern the same; valour enough in j
our twenty-seven million hearts to|
dare to do the bidding thereof? It .
will he seen."
