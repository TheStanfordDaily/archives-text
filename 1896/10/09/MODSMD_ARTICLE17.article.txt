Kditor Daily Palo Alto: The i
result of the match between our
men and the Reliance Club last'
Saturday only served to infuse
more energy into the team practice. |
The interest of the spectators on
the field every afternoon does not
diminish, but, on the contrary, is
growing steadily. Attention is j
mostly centered on individual play- i
ers whose places on the team are;
under competition. Last Monday
afternoon the team lined up against
the Olympics fora short practice.
Neither side scored. On Tuesday
they practiced with the Reliance.
Our men were first forced back but
eventually gained ground, and at
t lie close of the game were by the
Reliance goal. No touchdowns
were made, liansome, who was
slightly injured in the game with
the Olympics, is on the field again,
although not able to do much work.
The tennis club held a tourna
ment for players of the first, second,
and third class last Saturday on
the Madison court in Oakland i
For the first class there were six |
entries; in the second, six; and in
the third, five. The winners were
Magee, Krug, and Morse respect-)
i vely.
For some days past little cards
with "4 Big Clubs" have been scat
tered round the campus, and con
siderable interest was aroused as to
their meaning. All sorts of con
jectures were made, but now the
mystery is cleared up by parties
announcing a combination concert
to be given on the loth of this
month. The four musical clubs of
the college, assisted by the Delta
Upsilon quartet, and other uni
versity talent will fill the program.
The concert, will be under the direc
tion of C. K. Morse, director of the
banjo club, who managed the last
minstrel show with so much success.
Latest to appear in the sphere of
political clubs are certain anony
mous posters in North Hall con
cerning the formation of a club of
socialists. As yet it is not known
how far the organization has been
effected, nor whether indeed it is
to come about at all. That there
is a strong socialist element is well
known, but some are inclined to
believe that the posters are not the
work of the socialists themselves.
In all probability they were started
by one of that number, but lacking
support have not succeeded in
arousing anv interest.
The October number of the IJiii
rrrsity Ma.yazine was published last
Wednesday. Prof. Lyle contributes
an article on a journey in .fapan,
and Miss Flliott an essay <>n Cable
and the Creoles. The policy of the
hoard <>112 editors in offering a prize
fur the best literary essay to be
handed in before the Ist of the
month has not met with half the
success it deserved. But verv few

availed themselves of the opportu
nity, and it is doubtful if the prize
will he awarded at all.
