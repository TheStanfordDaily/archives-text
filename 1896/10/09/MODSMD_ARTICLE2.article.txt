The practice last night was a
gre;it improvement in many ways
over thai of any evening yet. The
players ilimed out in good numbers
and played a hard, snappy game,
showing improved form in inter
ference and general team-work.
The bleachers were well tilled with
spectators who did their best to en
courage the men on the field.
As on the previous evening the
V;irsitv gains were made chiefly
through (he line. The second
eleven was unable to make a very
strong stand against their heavier
opponents, who forced them down
the field again and again fora
touchdown.
The best run of the da v was made

by Parker through a scattered Held.
He caught a punted hall and made
a splendid gain, throwing off sev
eral would-he tacklers. lie also
made some clever tackles. Dole,
as halfback on the Varsity, made
the hest gains through the line.
Soper, although sometimes unahle
to find the openings in the line,
kept his feet in hucking, thus en
abling his side to push him through.
Sesiwright would have undoubtedly
made good gains had he kept his
feet instead of indulging in "hurd
ling'' tactics. When near the line
he would jump high in the air, thus
loosing all the momentum gained
in the start and rendering impossi
ble any aid his team might have
given him. Williams, at center,
was able to break through at will,
although his opponent, Hall, a very
light man, put up a plucky game.
