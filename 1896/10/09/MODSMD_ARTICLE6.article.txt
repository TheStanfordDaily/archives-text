# Prof. Polley on '49 Justice.
## 
### 
Prof. Polley was last night re
ceived with great applause when he
began the first of what promises to
be an interesting and instructive
course of lectures.
The times of '49 —between the
years IS-4<>— 1 H(>0 —were divided into
two periods, the first ending in
1851, and the second commencing
in 1852. During both periods most
of the people possessed a fair degree
of education, many of them being
college-bred men. The justices
during the first period were the
most popular men in the town,
generally being chosen from the
saloon-keeping class. They allowed
great familiarity between them
selves and the lawyers, which was
an obvious detriment to the strict
enforcement of the law.
In those days there were no
authorities on the law: the justices
relied more on their common-sense
than on anything else. The lynch
ings that occured at that time have
often been referred to by Bret Harte
and others as something funny and
intended for sport; but such is not
the case, for everything was done
with the utmost seriousness. The
only authentic history of such
things is obtained from the news
papers of the times. Everyone
carried weapons, the law against
concealed weapons being practically
a dead-letter. Long trials were out
of vogue. Long-winded arguments
were not allowed. Often only one
witness was heard and the judge
made his decision from the evidence
introduced by him.
Yet the justice law was generally
honestly administered, often for the
reason of obtaining cases and the
fees aitendent upon them. Out of
these times come many famous
jurists, notably Chief-Justice Field.
Justice Murray, who tried in
those days, was probably one of the
most corrupt men who ever sat on
the bench. Vet most of his decisions
are published in the California Re
ports, from the second to the seventh
volume.
After the presentation of further
facts concerning the early admin
istration of justice, Prof. Polley
read a number of passages from the
dockets of the early justice courts.
