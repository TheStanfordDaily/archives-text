The game was a good one, dis-j
tinguishtul l»v furious line-bucking,
liy long ]iunts, and hv poor offen
sive work on. hoth sides as compared j
with their defensive piny. In the
lirst half the Stanford goal was
once endangered, hut a "stiff hrace,"
and some fuinhling on the part of
the < Mvmpics, prevented a touch
down. Again in the second half
Stanford was sending her heavy
line-huckers against the Olympic
tackles and was working rapidly
toward the athletic cluh's goal j
when a fumhle on the twenty-yard |
line stopped our progress. Olympic
kicked out of danger, and time was
ca I led s< ion a fter.
()n the whole the work of the
team was not at all discouraging.
There were some weak points, how- ,
ever. The hacks, except Fisher,
did not «jet into ihe defensive work.
The ends failed to prevent the op- j
posing ends from hoxidg the tack-i
les. Our interference seemed iii
ferior to that of Olympic, owing!
largelv to Cross ordering the line- ;
men to play id their positions I
without attempting much interfer
ence. The Olympic lucks worked'
together much better than ours.
The best point about Stanford's
game was the stiffness of the line;
and the deplorably weak point,
team work in defensive play.
(if the individual men, Fisher
played by far the best game, both
offeiisi ve a lid defensive. His line-1
bucking was furious, while his!
tackling and backidg-up of the line'
resembled that of Fraiikeiiheinier. >
In fact, Fisher is in a fair way to:
step into the place of the"i minor ta I
Julius." Super's gauie was an ad
vance oil anything he has shown j
before. Ili~ line-bucking was an!
agreeable surprise and he kicked!
well out of clanger three or four!
tidies. One puut of a good forty- i
li ve yards deserves especia I meiit ion. ;
As usual, he was weak in catching.!
Seawright seemed to ha ve an off |
day; ln< play was disappointiiig. j
Madden got into the interference
well and did some good tackling,:
but he and McOilvrav had the best
men in the Olympic team to oppose.'
Mdiilvray was plainly suffering

from nervousness. Fickert was his
old reliable self. Mcintosh played
his usual plucky game, although
he ran the team rather poorly,
owing, perhaps, to an injury re
ceived early in the (irst half.
The Olympic ends played the
best game for their teams, boxing
our tackles again atul again and
getting down the Held on punts in
good form. Next to them, Stickney
most distinguished himself for all
round good work.
In the second half llice. B.
Thomas, and l)ole replaced Cotton,
Fisher, and Seawright.
The appended chart tells the
story of the game.

The opening play is at the top,
Stickney's kick-off from center for
Olymvic to Stanford's twenty-yard
line, where the first line-up occurs
with Stanford in possession of the
hall. A wavy line shows where the
ball is kicked;,*i cross where it is
downed with Stanford in posses
sion: a straight line where it is car
ried; a large dot where it is downed
with Olympic in possession; short
parallel lines where opponents |
break through the line ami tacklea
runner or hlock an attempted kick;
a dotted line where the hall is fum
bled; a broken line where a hall is
moved hy an official as a penalty
fora foul. The initial of the man
carrying or punting the hall is on
the line of its progress, and the
man making the tackle or downing
the hall appears immediately over

some of the downs where a notable
play occurred.
