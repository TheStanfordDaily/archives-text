# Wagnerian Concert.
## 
### 
Herr Anton Schott, the great

Wagnerian tenor, gave a concert in
the chapel last Friday night forihe
benefit, of the llildebrand Library.
A fair sized audience greeted the
great singer, but not so large as
last year. A snug sum, however,
was realized for the library. The
concert was up to the excellent
standard familiar to Stanford stu
dents and professors from hist
year's perfortnanee.
Heard at his best in the martial
airs, and the best of these is his
'Two (i renadieis.'" It is in this
masterpiece that the wonderful
volume of Heir Schott's voice is re
corded. His execution of the love
songs also elicited much compli
mentary notice, although he has
n<* the physical qualities to give
the charm of grace which is ex
pected.

A fact much commented upon by
all who saw the great tenor is his
stoutness acquired since his last
visit. II err Schott lias without
doubt lost much of his grand per
sonality by the gain in adipose tis
sue, entailing a certain awkward
ness when before his audience.
One of the features of the even
ing was the piano solo by Arthur
Fickenscher. Mr. Fickenscher is
an artist of much ability. His
style is somewhat technical, not
partaking of the emotional feeling
of I'aderewski. Fickenscher ex
ecutes the Paderewskian pieces with
a tine touch, but undoubtedly suf
fers in comparison with the greatest
living pianist, lie secured several
encores.
