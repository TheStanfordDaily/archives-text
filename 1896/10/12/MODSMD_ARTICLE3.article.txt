## 
### 
Last Saturday afternoon at Palo
Alto a Republican rally under the
auspices of the Stanford and Palo
Alto Republican clubs was ad
dressed by lien Butterworth of Ohio
and .Judge Walling, candidate for
presidential elector. The meeting
was attended by about eighteen
hundred people from all over the
Santa Clara valley. Something
that passed for music and sufficed
for applause was rendered by the
combined bands of the University,
Palo Alto, and May field.
John M. Switzer, president of the
University Republican Club, in
troduced the speakers in a few ap
propriate remarks, setting forth
the past history of the party and
telling of the large following which
McKinley bad in the University
among both students and faculty.
Congressman Butterworth spoke
of the local issue of woman suf
frage. and declared in favor of con
stitutional amendment in a few
well applied quotations. Continu
ing, Mr. Butterworth took up in
some detail the position of the two
parties as declared in their plat
forms. The tariff question was
discussed at great length and with
much ability, and more than once
lie grew eloquent in his enthusiasm.
The speaker paused here to
deliver a scathing rebuke to Mr.
Castle, the fusion candidate for
Congress in the Seventh District for
the revolutionary speeches he is
making throughout the district.
He then took up the money ques
tion and gave an able exposition of
the Republican view. He next
touched on the planks of the Chi
cago platform denouncing Presi
dent Cleveland and the Supreme
Court. Here the congressman
waxed eloquent in condemning the
incendiary elements of the Demo
cratic platform The address occu
pied a little over an hour and was
well received by the large audience.
Following Congressman Butter
worth, .Judge Walling spoke fora
few minutes on the financial ques
tion, but owing to bis dull oratorv
and a strong northeast wind, the
audience soon melted away.
At the conclusion.of .Judge Wall
ing's address "The Battle Cry of
Freedom'' was rendered by the
combined bands.
