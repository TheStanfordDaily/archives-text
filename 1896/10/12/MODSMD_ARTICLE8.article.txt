It is a matter of congratulation
that Stanford has been able thus
early in the season to put an eleven
on the gridiron which was able to
play a tie game with an athletic
club team composed of veteran
players well trained for the game.
Although we played against heavy
odds our men made a finer show
ing than the most sanguine had
predicted. It, is not well, however,
to be unduly puffed up over the re
sult of the game last Saturday. It.
will take much hard work to make
our team what it should be, and a
small success should not interfere
with the work. 11 were better to
be defeated than to win and become
over-confident.
