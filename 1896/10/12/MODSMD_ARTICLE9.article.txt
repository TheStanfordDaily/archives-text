Attention has already been
e;il led to the annoyance caused by
sprinkling carts and buses pass
ing near the quad windows
during recitation hours, but there
seems to be no abatement of the
nuisance. Professors in the east
classrooms are repeatedly forced to
suspend lectures for five or ten min
utes during an hour because of the
noise outside. The racket drowns
out the lecturer's voice and calls
away the attention of the students.
As it causes a great loss of time and
unending worry, some regulations
should be made which would ren
der it impossible for drivers to pass
close to the quad during recitation
hours.
