# FRESHMEN DEFEATED.
## Nineteen Hundred Team Loses a Sensational Game to Belmont. 
### 
Today's game between the Fresh- j
men and Belmont, developed some
sensational features. It was a hot j
game from start to finish; a case of
a light, active team with splendid j
team play matched against a heav-J
ier team, better individually, but i
sadly lacking in team play. As
usual, the team that worked to- j
gether won.
It was curious also in the way
the scoring came in. There was no
score made in the first half. In
the second Stanford scored and
missed goal. Just two minutes be
fore time was called Belmont
crossed the '00 line and missing j
goal tied the score. Stanford kicked
off. Wadsworth of Belmont, who
had been playing a star game,
caught the ball on his own twenty
yard line. 'The interferers of the
preparatory school fell in li.ie like
machinery, and the little half went
tearing past Stanford's ends and
backs with higgles ami Lieici at hisj
heels. On our five-yard line higgles)
reached his man, but was blocked
off by Beid, and Wadsworth went j
over fora touchdown, winning the i
game. It was a splendid run of I
fully ninety yards —one of the best i
ever seen here, and it aroused the]
keenest enthusiasm on both sides.
That the Freshmen were -disap-j
pointed goes without saving, but
after all the defeat was wholly J
their fault. There has never been j
better material here fora Freshman ,
team, and there has never been so
little done in the way of getting'
that material into shape. Night I
alter night the captain has found j
some six or seven men out for prac-j
tice, almost never enough to make I
up a team. It is no wonder, under
these circumstances, that our ends]
were drawn in, that our backs had j
to dodge around their opponents!
without any interference, and that, (
we fumbled at about every third
play. It' Nineteen Hundred is
beaten by the team of a prepar
atory school which two years ago i
our freshmen beat 48-4, what will
happen when Nineteen Hundred |
runs into the U. C. freshmen?

usual laggards the teams lined up
with the ball in Belmont's posses

ran the ball into Stanford's thirty
yard line. There were several fum
bles on both sides. Finally Lana

ing. There was a fumble here, and
Belmont kicked out of danger
Stanford again bucked the center
for good gains. but lost the ball
once more, this time well up in Bel
mont territory. Belmont made fif
teen yards by a fake kick. Then
the Stanford infants took the ball
on downs, got ten yards on Bel
mont's off-side play, and went down
the lit'ld by short line plays to Bel
mont's two-yard line. On the down
Stanford went across, but fumbled
on the very line, and Wadsworth
carried the hall back into the field,
preventing a safety. Belmont kicked
out of danger as time was called.
In the second half both teams
warmed up, and the " preps "' took
on a do-and-die character, which
wins games. Belmont fumbled at
the kick-off and Nineteen Hundred
took the ball well down into Bel
mont, territory. After one or two
ineffectual line plays McGilvray
ran down the field fora touchdown,
behind the only interference the
Freshmen developed in the game.
The ball went down in touch, and
the Freshmen failed to catch the
punt-out. Score 4-0 favor of 1900.
Belmont kicked off, Stanford

McGilvray ran the ball out of dan
ger. higgles kicked, Carson
caught and went through a scat
tered field to Stanford's fifteen

play, allowing Wadsworth to score
a touchdown. No goal Score, 4—4.
