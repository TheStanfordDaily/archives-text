The honor system in examina
tions is receiving a trial in one of
the law courses in the University,
with what success, remains to be
seen. In several eastern universi
ties the system prevails with satis
factory results; in other colleges it
has failed. The experiment has
never been given a conclusive test
at Stanford, although it has been
tried in some instances. The law
students are placed on their own
honor, and upon them the whole
responsibility rests for its success or
failure. The failure would bring
discredit upon the class and upon
the whole body of students, while
favorable results would probably
end in the adoption oi the system
in other departments.
