Announcement is made that John
Hopkins University will close its
doors to women. Just what in
duced the authorities to arrive at
such a decision is not known, but
the wisdom of the act from the
standpoint of progressive develop

ment may well lÂ»e questioned. It
has come to be quite generally
supposed that the admission of wo
men to collegiate standing is an
evolution through which our Ameri
can universities are not only passing
hut must continue to pass until the
conditions become universal; that
there can he no justifiable reason
for limiting the opportunities of wo
men in acquiring a higher educa
tion, so long as the world contin
ues to develop on those broad and
liberal lines which lie at the bot
tom of nineteenth century civiliza
tion and advancement. Under
such circumstances the action of
Johns Hopkins University comes
as a general surprise, and until the
inside facts become known it can
only be viewed, from the stand
point of education and progress, in
the light of a retrograde movement.
