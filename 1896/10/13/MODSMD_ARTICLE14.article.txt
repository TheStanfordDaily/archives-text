Thk advantages of frequent prac
tice games with outside elevens can
not he under-estimated in the train
ingof our football eleven. The prac
tice in determining the weak points
in the opponent's line, learning how
to meet new plays, and all the pe
culiarities of the other teams is in
valuable. It is also effective in de
veloping team work, and putting
plays and men to a test. It en
ables both coach and captain to ob
serve the men under lire.
Tendencies of new men to be ner
vous and get pronounced cases of
"rattles" may be overcome during
these games. The Varsity soon be
comes accustomed to the weak
points of the second eleven, and
every Varsity man knows the in
dividual weaknesses of his oppo
nent on the second team. Con
tact with experienced players is an
excellent way for the men to learn
the game. The present schedule
serves that purpose, but the student
body of Stanford would be pleased
to be able to judge the progress of
the Varsity by a game on the cam
pus with some strong eleven.
The games arranged for the
freshman team will serve to make
known its weak places, and will
point to their remedy. The fresh
man team can not have too mu h
practice with neighboring teams.
