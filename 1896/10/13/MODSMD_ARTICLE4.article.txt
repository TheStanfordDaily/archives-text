# Mrs. Ballington-Booth.

Maud Ballington-Booth,once "the
! beauty of the Salvation Army,''
j now commander, with her hus
j band, of '"God's American Volun
i teers," will, as formerly announced,
speak in the chapel at 2 p.m. to
] morrow. All old students remem
ber the impression made by Mrs.
: Booth last year. Few of the audi
ence that met her last year agreed
! with her religious views, but all
j were won by her sincerity, her earn-
I est desire to uplift the unfortunate,
and her womanly sweetness. Com
mandant and Mrs. Booth were, at
i the time we last heard her, in com
i mand of the American division of the
| Salvation Army. It is the plan of the
j army government, situated at Lon
[ don, to transfer commandants from
! division to division every few years.
! An order was issued last year trans
ferring Mr. and Mrs. Booth from
their American command. Being
| thoroughly in sympathy with the
I movement in America, and prefer
ring to work here rather than else
; where, the Booths seceded from
the army and formed the volun
teers. The two bodies work in har
mony; there is no conflict, and
much as we might desire to hear
| reasons for the movement, it is
probable that Mrs. Booth will make
1 no reference to her new command.
| Mrs. Booth has a thorough knowl
edge of practical sociology, and all
I interested in the "uplifting of the
| slums" should make an effort to
I bear her.
