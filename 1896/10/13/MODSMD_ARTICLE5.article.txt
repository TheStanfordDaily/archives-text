The 1 liter-Society Debating Lea
gue held its first meeting Saturday
evening in tlie chapel with Presi
dent Hureha.ni in the elntir.
Secretary Wardall read the min
utes of the previous meeting, which
were approved. The report of the
committee on weights, measures,
and coinage was called for. Snedden,
'97, gave the majority report favor
ing the adoption of the resolution,
â€¢'Resolved, That Congress pass a
law providing for the free and un
limited coinage of silver" Tehhs,
'99, gave the report of the minority,
Miss Grieb,'9B, and himself, who
opposed the passage the resolution.
Hull, '98, spoke in favor of the
resolution. Miss Grieb followed,
opposing the resolution, and made
one of the most convincing speeches
of the evening, using irony and sar
casm very effectively in answering
her opponents. 8e11,'97 and Wilson,
'00 made good speeches in favor of
free coinage of silver.
Mr. Tehhs mystified the audience
hy rising, and contradicting his
previous statements and making a
free silver speech. The congress
was at a loss how to account for
his sudden change in sentiments,
whether he was- imitating several
modern statesmen or whether he
was influenced by the "silver"'
lobby present. The sudden defection
in the gold ranks stupefied the
supporters <>112 international bimetal
lism, and lost them the day despite
the efforts of Miss Grieb, Williams,
'97, Higley, '00, and Riggins, '98
to stem the tide. Morgan, '98,
closed the debate for the affirmative
in the most eloquent speech of the
evening. The vote on the resolution
stood 26 to 1(5 in support of the
committee's report.

Id some respects the meeting was
very like the United States Senate
after which it is modeled. But
some of the speakers completely
caused the similarity to disappear.
The debate would have been more
interesting had the committee
chosen some one to present the
minority report who was at heart
opposed to the free coinage of silver.
The meeting was poorly attended,
hardly one half of the members be
ing present.
