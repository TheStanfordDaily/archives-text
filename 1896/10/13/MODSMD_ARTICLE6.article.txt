# "Practical Politics" Reading Club.
## 
### 
A number of the class in Prac
tical Politics met in room 28 Friday
afternoon to consider a plan for
systematic reading of the newspa
pers for which the department has
subscribed. Prof. Powers gave a
number of suggestions as to organi
zation, work, and the care of the
tiles of papers, and outlined very
briefly the position taken by the
Springfield Republican, New York
Post, and a few other papers which
the department will secure.
Mr. Snedden was elected presi
dent and Mr. Dyke secretary. A
committee of three drafted resolu
tions for the club to sign. All
members of the class in Practical
Politics who have library privi
leges and who sign the articles of
the club are members. The papers
will be in room 20 at any time, ex
cept on Tuesday from 2 to 4 and in
the evenings. A meeting of the
club will be held every Wednesday
evening, at which someone will
read the articles of most import
ance. An executive committee, who
will he announced in the Daily
Palo Alto, will have the papers in
charge.
All who use the literature are re
quested not to mutilate, mark, or
use it carelessly, as obviously the
papers will not. stand a great de;il
of wear. More definite plans for
systematic reading will be an
nounced later.
