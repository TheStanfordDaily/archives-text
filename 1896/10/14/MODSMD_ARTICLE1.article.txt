# MATKA AND KOTIK.
## Dr. Jordan Tells a Story of the Seal Industry. 
### 
An audience which filled the
chapel to its doors greeted Dr. Jor
dan last night, on the occasion of
his first lecture this year. The
lecture consisted of a simple and
sympathetic tale illustrating the
slaughter of seals going on under
present conditions, and the danger
and inhumanity of permitting the
killing of seal cows, Matka, a
seal-cow, Kotik, her calf, and
Alagh. the father seal, form a family
whose fortunes Dr. Jordan followed
in his lecture. It is impossible, in
a synopsis, to express anything of
the grace and beauty of the story.
The story, beside its beauty and
pathetic force, is spiced by a little
satire on the ways of men. Matka
conies onto the ice-floe, Atagh's
home, with her younger brother.
,4 Oh, you boy!" she said, .' boys are
always so silly; they don't go into
society. One can't know boys, and
you must never speak to me, for if
you do Atagli will blow a cloud at
you and you will feel no bigger
than Kickkao, the little blue fox,
for .ill your great moustaches Now
climb up on the parade ground
like a good little bachelor and I
will let you look down sometimes
to see Atagli. that you may grow
to he like him. Now don't stand
in niv way, for there is Atagli wait
ing.''
The story goes on with the court
ing of Atagli and the home life of
the seal family on their cozy floe,
with the growing-tip of Kotik, and
finally the tragedy that came upon
1 hem.
We found Matka dead on Zoltoi
sands with the cruel spear-head
fast in her velvet neck. She had
tried to come ashore at Tolstoi.
She was not strong enough. The
rocks were steep, the surf ran high,
and she bad lost much blood.
When she tried to call back to
Lakutka. the salt water came into
her wounded throat and the tide
rips swept her a way over to Zoltoi,
where the great waves threw her
body on the shining sands, and
little Lakutkn waited for her on
the flat top of a broken column
close to the water's edge, calling
across the surf day after day. She
is waiting there yet, but she calls
no longer, for she fell asleep at last
and her little pinched body still
rests in the crevice between the
columns of basalt.
And now the sad days have
come to the twin mist-islands.
The ships of the Pirate Kings
swarm in the icy sea. The blood
of t he si 1 ken-ha i red ones, thousand
by thousand, stains the waves as
they roll, the decks of the schooners
are smeared with their milk, while
their little ones are left on the
rocks to wail and starve. Their
cries go up day and night from all
the deserted homes from Tapadrie
to far Novastoshna and on the sis
ter island from Stari Art.il.
Meanwhile Kotik and Sikateh,
I'olasikatcli and Holustiak stand
in their places at Tolstoi, roaring
and groaning, waiting for the si I ken -
haired ones that never come. And
their call conies to me across the
green waves; I turn mv eyes away
from Tolstoi Head, and put aside

in)' pen. It is growing chill. The
mist is rising from I he Salt Lagoon,
and there is no brightness in the
Zolt <>i Sil mis.
