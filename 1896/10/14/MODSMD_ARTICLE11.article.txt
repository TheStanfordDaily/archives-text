It is a very striking fact that in
all this great body of about one
thousand students who are here at
Stanford presumably in the cause
of learning, not even one fourth of
that number are subscribers to the
daily papers. It seems very strange
that such should be the case, for it
is quite natural to suppose that
university students would be ex
ceedingly desirous of being well
versed in matters relating to the af
fairs of the world. Why subscribers
to papers are so rare at Stanford it
is difficult to say. It may be be
cause of the expense involved, or
perhaps it is due to lack of interest.
Those who can not afford the lux
ury of a daily paper lament its ab
sence in the University library.
There is not a daily paper to be
found on any of the tables. Nowa
days the man or woman who is
not up to date stands a fair chance
of being left out of the race. To be
well informed in tliis latter half of
the Nineteenth Century is half the
battle.
