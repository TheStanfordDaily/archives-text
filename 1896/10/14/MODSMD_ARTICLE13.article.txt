Editor Daily Palo Alto: A com
munication in Thursday's paper
signed ''Student" is in reality an
attack on the student body man
agement by one who is manifestly
ignorant of student body finances.
I know of no better way of judging
of the efficiency of the present man
agement than by comparing it with
those of the past. A search of the
books of the association shows that
two dollars of the assessment has
been collected up to datcthis year
where one had been collected last
year at this time. Last year the
management borrowed â€¢$.')()() at
the start. This year not a dollar
has yet been borrowed, although
heavier current expenses have been
met than were met last year at an
even date.
A receipt-book has been left with
the postmaster, and lie is authorized
to receive the assessment. Several
collectors are now and have been
at work; others will be appointed.
The treasurer always has a receipt
book with him and will receive the
assessment at an}' time.
What we want is the kind of loy
ally that begets a readiness to pay
the assessment and not the sham
article which attempts, by creating
the impression that the manage
ment is inefficient, to throw greater
obstacles in its way.
