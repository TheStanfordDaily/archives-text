# Mrs. Booth's Lecture.
## 
### 
Fully an hour before the time
announced for Mrs. Booth's lecture
the chapel was tilled to overflowing
with students. Aisles were tilled
with chairs, and radiators and win
dows (inside and out) were all ten
anted. The lecture was an account
of the breaking away of the Ameri
can Volunteers from the old Salva
tion Army, and also of Mrs Booth's
work in the new organization in the
different penitentiaries, but partic
ularly in Sing Sing.
Dr. Jordan in a simple speech
presented Mrs. Ballingion-Booth to
the audience. The lecture was
about as follows:
It gives me great pleasure to see
once more the pupils at Stanford,
even though 1 am here under
changed conditions from those of
last year —not in the same organi
zation as then, nor doing the same
work. It was hard to break away
front the old order, and it was a
small band that started the work
of the Volunteers. But we found
God's light in the darkness and
were able to ,t. r o forward in spite of
evil prognostications of failure. We
have founded a society, not fora
class, as has been stated by some,
but for the needy and the hopeless
wherever the)' may be found. We
come to work, not to talk. Although
we are small in numbers, we are
great in purpose and feel that we
shall go forward in spite of all. We
are like the little dwindling moun
tain stream, almost dry, which was
derided by tne willow that grew on
its banks and by the bridge that
spanned it. But the winds came
and the rains fell; the brook grew
into a torrent and swept away the
bridge. The willow questioned it
about the derisive bridge, and the
stream answered and said: "I have
swept it away on niv bosom. Once
1 was small but the rains came
from the hills and I grew in
strength." Just so is the army of
the Volunteers looking for help
from the hills above, and will grow
in strength and power for good.
W'e do not speak of the contro
versy between the old and the new.
We wish that controversy was dead.
But we had to break away from the
old, because no institution, no gov
ernment, and no country can live
when the seat of power is three
thousand miles away. (Applause.)
New conditions kept constantly
arising in this new land of America
which we could not deal with ad
equately in the old methods, and so
suggested new lines of action to the
headquarters in England. But
our answers all were, "We do not do
that way here. It can not be done
there and still lie in accordance
with the rules and regulations of
the organization," until we wished
the mail overboard where the lea
had gone before it. (Applause.) I
felt down-hearted and sore wounded
when the news came that we were
no longer a branch of the Salvation
Army, and longed to getaway from
the world, to go to some lonely
place, some wilderness, where even
the inevitable} reporter could not
find me. ( Laughter.)

Since then we have grown slowly
and rationally. We want no
sporadic growth nor an unnatural
one. We have builded by our own
efforts and did not start with great
capital, as some have thought. We
started with only $100, and that!
was borrowed. We gave up the
$200,01)0 headquarters building j
which we had just completed, uml
started out without let or hindrance
at the bottom rung of the ladder.
But we do not want our way, our
plans, and our aims alone; we want
God's way. We must have what
seems to Him good. We have
made our flag of white for purity,
with the single true blue star of
Hope; and our watchword is, "The
Lord our banner." "Thy will be
done," is our creed. We of the
Volunteer Army say, "Lord, send
to us what to Thee in Thy goodness
and wisdom seem est. best."
We are not with any church, but
are independent and doing work
that churches can not and do
not do.
We are ranked and uniformed as
in the United States army, and we
have our commander, but he is
aided and checked by a council, for
we do not believe in one-man power.
We do not work fora class, but
aim, as I said before, to bring hope)
to the hopeless hearts and Christ to
the Christless ones. Wherever
there is need of human sympathy
and human love, there we go. But
naturally we go to the poor and
blighted—them that need most.
We want to make heaven wherever
we go. And sometimes we go to
the lowest of places to make
heaven —even to the prisons.
'"Ah," you say, "but they are
places of incorrigibility." It is not
so. My work has been at Sing
Sing. Joliet, San Quentin, and other
prisons, and 1 have found the so
lution of the problem of the refor
mation of the criminal. Most
people treat criminals as a mass —
a class distinct from others. But I
say, treat individuals alone. There
is as much vanity and individual
ity in an audience in Sing Sing as
in any I have spoken to. Prison
work is mine. I glory in it.and
feel 1 am doing more good than 1
ever before. There are men in I
prison who never had a chance, I
have drifted from bad to worse, and
when they are out are pointed out
and dogged as ex-convicts, and
never even have a chance at reform.
Everyone expects them to sin
again, predicts another downfall,
and of course the downfall comes.
It is not a fair show.
But we started a movement that
even the Argus-eyed reporters failed
to get at until it was done. [Laugh
ter.] We have made a place where
discharged criminals can go and
not be hounded as felons. Where
they can live out their lives and
not make brushes and shoes; where
they are free and have a home. We
were at a loss fora name —not like!
the "Home for ex-Convicts," where j
a man is still branded and no morel
free than while in jail. We had
the boys at Sing Sing select the
name and they chose "Hope Hall." i
There they have a home where they i
do their own work; where there is a
dearth of rules and black walls,
and where there are white curtains!
and enamelled beds.

Our work is to lead men from
vice to virtue an<l to keep tlieni in
virtue. And when a man is free
we want to make him free in every
way, and our Hope Hall is to give
a new start in life and a good one.
A man would rather not have to go
back to prison. He will do well if
he has a chance. He will crawl
from his bed in a prison hospital to
die on the road like a dog, so he
can die free.
Mrs. Kooth also at the conclusion
of her lecture told many pathetic
stories of prisoners and prison life,
and made an appeal to the people
in the audience to help the world
all in their power. She has started
;i Hope Hall in San Francisco which
can now accommodate ten men.
