# No Line-Up.

### 
Owing to the delay in starting
the Freslmnm-Belniont game, there
was 110 regular line-up iast night.
The men practiced catching, punt
ing, and signal practice until dark.
There is considerable comment
heard over the attitude taken by
the freshmen concerning football
matters. Jt was probably unfor
tunate for them that they won the
first game; it made them over-con
tident, and when they failed to win
the class championship they settled
into apathy. They are all to
blame for the condition of the
team, those in authority because of
a lack of energy in getting the men
out, and the men themselves be
cause of their half-hearted dis
couragement A good sample of
their attitude on the question is
the expressed desire of some of the
freshmen to let Saturday's Oakland
game go by default, for no reason
under the sun than that they
feared defeat owing to last night's
showing.
A class filled with Hefflefingers
and Butterworths couldn't win a
plain class game with such a spirit.
The '98 freshman team did not have
much good material, but the older
students remember how they used
to get out and practice before break
fast. With poor material, poorly
managed, they nevertheless kept at
it and their defeat was no disgrace.
Can not 11)00 get some of this same
do-and-die spirit? The Oakland
men may beat them, probably will,
but this is all the more reason why
the freshmen should get to work.
