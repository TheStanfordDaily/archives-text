The action of students in holding
seats for late corners to popular lec
tures and to class-rooms can not be
too highly condemned. To he sure
there are exceptions to every rule,
and there might now and then he

practice is absolutely unreasonable.

on time should have the Hivt right
to the seats, and no one is justified
in withholding them.
