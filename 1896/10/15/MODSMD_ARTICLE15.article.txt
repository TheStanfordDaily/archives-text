We heard yesterday that crimi
nals were not to be treated as a
class but as individuals. Perhaps
then those individuals whose per
sistent whisperings so much dis
turb students who go to the library
to study may be reasoned with and
brought under some sort of reform
ing influence. It may be that they
are unconscious of the annoyance
they give their neighbors; but when
students at the library tables argue
politics, or become involved in such
a discussion as to whether the her
ring resembles more closely the sar
dine or the trout, they lay them
selves open to the charge that they
do not know what the library is
for. And at the same time they

provoke among their fellows the
wish that the disturbers were some
where else.
