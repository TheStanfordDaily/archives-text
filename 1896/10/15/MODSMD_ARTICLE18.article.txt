The Boston (Hohc has this to say
about the opening of W ellesley:
"The opening Sunday at Welles
ley College is always mildly dra
matic, but nevertheless, always |
picturesque and pleasing. Bobed in
white, the freshman class proceed]
to the chaj el and listen to a ser
mon upon the invariable text, "(Jod
is love." The little place of wor
ship was a bovver of tl >ral beauty
vesterdav. l'ottcd plants, tall ferns,
baskets of fresh Mowers and wreaths
were scattered aml festooned about
the desk and the auditorium. First
impressions count for much, and
homesick maidens are peculiarly
susceptible to the beauty and
sympathy and consolation of Moral
remembrances. So sweet a wel
come does much to develop a swift
attachment to the new home, where,
once the strangeness has passed,
they will spend lourof the happiest,
and in many cases the most profit
able, years of their lives. \\ hat
has already been said about the
growth of a demand for college
educations, in a ratio greater than
the increase of facilities in our New
Knghtnd institutions, applies par
t icularly to Wellesley. ()nlv a little
over twenty years old, and rein
forced from time to time since its
opening with additional accommo
dations, it has at last reached the
unusual point of a waiting list, and
all who passed the examination
can not matriculate. lOven the
chapel is now too small for the
eight hundred students, and the
dormitories have long been inade
quate. And all this, notwithstand
ing the other institutions that have
been opened and expanded in this
state during the past twenty-five
vears to meet the rapidly growing
demands for the higher education
of women. I'roba bly the ot her col -
lege,- for the sex are experiencing
sinii lar em ba rrassinent. The mean
iuu' of all this is wholesome, even if
the situation is attended with
temporary inconvenience and dis
appointment."
