The state agent of the HnnkeVs'
Lite Association of Des Moines,
lowa, Mr. HMward K. Delger, who
recently visited the I'niver.-ity, very
ki11(11 y explained the system of his
compa ny to us, and we must can
didly admit that it impressed u
most favorably. The glut run tee and
surplus fund of the company, now
in the eighteenth year of its exist
ence, exceeds $2,000,000, and is in
deed a splendid guarantee hoth of
the stability of the company as
well as to a continuance of their
surprisingly low rites, furnishing
insurance on a man's life, aged 40,
at an annual average rate of $*.40
per thousand, and at correspond
ingly low rates for other ages. The
assets of the association are under
1 he direct control of the state au

thorities and are by them safely in
vested. We would recommend any
one interested to either call upon
or communicate with Mr. Delger,
whose head office is located in the
Safe Deposit Building in San Fran
cisco.
