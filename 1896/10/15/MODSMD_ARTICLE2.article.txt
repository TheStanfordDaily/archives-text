Coach Cross was away yesterday,
and the play was in consequence
ragged. The only redeeming fea
ture was the development of inter
ference. The line-men are begin
ning to get into the |day, and some
of tne work shown last night was
leal Iv credit a hie. Outside of this
the work was poor, there being too
much fumbling and general loose
p'ay.

Clemans made the star plav, a
long run with a caught punt. He
went, fifty yards down a. scattered
field under good interference, dodg
ing in his brother's own style. The
best a 11-round work, offensive and
defensive, among the backs was
that done by .lost who bucked the
line strongly and tackled all over
the field Thomas also made sev
eral long runs under good interfer
ence bv the backs on his side.
The hospital list is larger, but
includes, fortunately, no very se
rious injuries. If men must be
laid off fur repairs it is better that
it should occur now rather than
later in the season.
