## 
### 
On Saturday the Freshman
team will play a game of foot
ball with a team from the
Oakland High School. In their
present weak condition the fresh
men will have little chance to dis
tinguish themselves, though some
of the new candidates may develop
good form. I he game will at least,
serve to hringout any latent ma
terial which the class may possess.

The Oakland team is a strong ag
gregation of players, and practice
against them will be of great ad
vantage to our freshman players.
