charge of the matter have stated
that President .Jordan might have

offered to scientific men in this
country. It is of life tenure and
carries with it the directorship of
the National .Museum, which is the
center <>112 American science. To
properly expand the work of the

said, are looking to President .Jor

Dr. Jordan states, however, that
under no circumstances will he
leave Stanford so long as he is tit
for any position at all. Though it
is a desirable position in every way,
nothing can induce him to
forsake the University and its
interests. The students, their enter
prises, wants, and possibilities are
dearer to him than a place of
national fame.
