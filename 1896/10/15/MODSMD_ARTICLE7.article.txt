# Students' Boarding Club Will Liquidate.
## 
### 
It is a well-known fact that the
Students' Hoarding Club for lust
year ran behind in expenses to the
amount of $U25. * The cause for
this deficiency lay in the fact that
so many students left the hall dur
ing the latter part of the year, thus
greatly lowering the receipts while
the expenditures were lowered hut
little. The halls were sub-let by
i he faculty committee, consisting of
Professors Marx, Stillman, and
Wood, to the Students' Boarding
Club, and at the end of last semes
ter ihe accounts were taken charge
of by this ci tin n lit lee.
A notice was posted today which
requested all members of the Stu
dents' Hoarding Clu.) of last year
to make contributions to help pay
the debt, it is sincerely hoped that
this plan v\ ii 1 be successful.
