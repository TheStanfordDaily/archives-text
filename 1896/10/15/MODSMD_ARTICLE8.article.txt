# New Regulations.
## 
### 
Heretofore it has lieen only nec
essary for the Stanford musical or
ganizations to get the permission
of the student body in order to go
on a trip or play in public. 1 ie
eentlv a faculty committee on mu
sic has been formed with Professor
Lathrop as chairman, and from
now (Hi all musical organizations
will have to get the special permis
sion of this committee in order to
go upon a trip or to play in a pub
lic performance.
The objects of this restriction are,
first, to limit the number of public
appearances of the different organ
izations, and second, to keep ;ill
students who are behind in their
University work from membership
in the organizations themselves.
It is certainly hoped that the com
mittee will be lenient in enforcing
their rules until after the Thanks

giving entertainment, because,
should they nut, it might work
great hardship to those engaged in
arranging for the evening's pro
gram.
