# Thursday Night's Practice.
## 
### 
The practice on the football field
last night showed a great improve
ment over former practices and was
a source of much encouragement to
the interested spectators who lined
the oval. The Varsity was able to
play with the second eleven at will,
scoring four touchdowns during
the course of the evening, thelirst
one being made within five minutes
after play began. There was con
siderable fumbling and a great deal
of high tackling done, but on the
whole the men showed up well.
The best interference which has
been seen here this year was de
veloped by the first eleven, against
which the second eleven could make
litt ieeffective resistance. The backs J
circled both ends several times, and
the line-men experienced little
difficulty in breaking through their,
opponents' guard. The second 1
eleven showed the need of a little
better team work, but this may be
explained from the fact that its,
composition is constantly under-'
going change. Many of the men j
tackled high; especially is this thei
case with Thomas, Fickert, and
Leavitt. The latter gets into the
plays well, but does not bring his
man down as he should.
The line-up of the first half was
as follows:
KIKST. SECOND.
Straight 1 end r. . . . R. Smith i

[
In the second half Robinson re
placed B. Thomas Coates replaced i
Bigelow, Trip replaced Diggles, and
l'oindexter replaced Leavitt on the|
second eleven.
For the first eleven Dole did per-1
baps the best playing. He made I
several long runs and used the I
"straight arm" to good effect. 8.1
Thomas also, when transferred to
the first eleven, did effective work
at halfback. It seems to be ;i good
plan to give the li;i 11 to the halfs
oftener than has been the custom
heretofore, for last night's showing
demonstrates that they can be de
pended upon for their distance.
Burnett, although a freshman and
new at the game, made a very
creditable showing. He is heavy,
and well built and did not seem to I
experience much difficulty in hand-!
ling Buntin, bis opponent. Bur-1
nett seems to have the football in j
him. and the Freshman team I
would do well to give him a trial at
center. Straight, at right end for thei
Varsity, made some good runs, and j
broke up the interference well. 1
Cotton, at tackle, also played a fine I
game, making several good gains|
and tackling once or twice behind!
the line. At one time it looked as
if he was sure fora touchdown j
with almost a clear field before j
him, but R. Smith brought him to
earth by a very ne;it tackle before!
he had gone very far.
For the «econd eleven. Barker,
.lost, (!. Thomas, Rice, and Robin
son did the best work. Barker was'

effective in defensive work and
made one or two good gains through
the line. Jost bucked the line in
his usual "battering-ram" style,
lie is fast gaining the distinction
of being the best bucket* on the
field. Robinson, who replaced B.
Thomas as fullback when the
latter took Seawright's place at right
half on the first eleven, made what
is considered the finest tackle seen
on the grounds this season, by
cleverly downing Dole after a
pretty run of of twenty yards.
