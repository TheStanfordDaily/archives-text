Onk of the most unmitigated
nuisances a. student has to endure
in these days is the abominable
craze for books with uncut edges.

would be a great gain if the book
hinder would do at one stroke what
c< sts book-buyers hours of use
less labor. Moreover, edges cut by
hand are so rough that they offer a

convenient lodging-place for all the
dirt that comes into contact with
tliem; books with rough edges are
not so easily handled as those with
edges nicely trimmed on a machine;
and they are certainly no more ar
tistic. The custom of sending out
books made in this way is simply
due to a senseless fad. Those who
buy books to vse will welcome the
day when it is at an end.
