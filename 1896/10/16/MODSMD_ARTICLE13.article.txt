There are numerous ways in
which the loyal student can show
an interest in his alma muter.
Every Stanford student wlio makes
it a point to trade with those tinns
who advertise in Stanford publica
tions, when those tinns sell as
cheaply as others, encourages them
to continue and increase their pat
ronage and so add to the substantial
support of our student publica
tions. There are several tinns sell
ing goods to Stanford students who
are entirely ignorant of that fact;
consequently they never think of
offering our undertakings their sup
port. If students would take occa
sion to make themselves known
when making purchases it would
make it easier to get advertisers to
help along Stanford enterprises.
This is a little thing for each stu
dent. but in the aggregate it is very
important.
