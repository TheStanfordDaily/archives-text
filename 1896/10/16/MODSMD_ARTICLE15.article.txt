A special effort is being ni;ide
this year to make a place for
this sport. The one tiling needful
is to awaken interest on the other
side of the hay, and it is expected
that intercollegiate rivalry will do
tilt; rest.
There are probably few games
which are so useful in giving all
round development, ami few sports
so all-absorbing and fascinating as
lacrosse. It is like chess, golf, or
curling, in that its devotee becomes
its slave. One great advantage in
the game is that there is no great
amount of team play, and the play
ers may do most of their training
alone. Beyond learning the trick
of throwing and catching the ball
with the "crnsse.'' there is 110 great
skill required. Speetl and endur
ance are the chief requisites; al
most anyone having these qualities
may learn lacrosse. Twelve men
constitute a team, and of course a
much larger number of candidates
are wanted to begin work. The
only outfit needed is a"crosse"cost
ing from two to four dollars, and
an ordinary running suit.
