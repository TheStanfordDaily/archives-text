Editor Daily Palo Alto: Fora
long time past tlie San Francisco
papers luive made capital of the
actions of our student body. Any
thing of import occurring among us
is ;i ill once seized upon hy them
and presented in such a way as to
convey ;i totally wrong impression
upon the mind of the public. The
last week has brought us an in
stance of this kind which for fla
grant misrepresentation has never
before been equalled; and it so
aroused our indignation that (he
storm has not yet subsided.
It all came about in this way.
The Bryan Club, on hearing of the
action of Yale students when Bryan
was addressing them, passed resolu
tions strongly condemning the af
fair, and forwarded a copy of these
to the president of Yale. Now this
action of the Bryan Club had
rather an air of assumption about
it which even the Bryan men them
selves acknowledge. Aside from
this general feeling, however, no
further notice was taken of it by
the student body. To our utter
surprise the Saturday Examiner
came out with a notice that the
whole college was in a political tur
moil, that partisan spirit had
reached fever heat, and that the
whole Bryan Club was about to be
expelled from the student body at
the next meeting of the associated
students.
That was bad enough, but to add
to it, Monday's Examiner in one of
its columns declared that our men
students had started on an anti
co-educational crusade; that the
question of the toleration of women
students in the university would be
considered, together with the ex
pulsion of the Bryan men, at the
next meeting of the associated stu
dents, and that the Bryan men
would unite with the co-eds. in de
fending their rights.
Anything more absurd was prob
ably never penned. But its ab
surdity could be no excuse for its
utter falsity. A misrepresentation
of the gravest kind was set before
the public, reflecting in no desir
able way upon the character of our
student body.
The associated students met last
Monday and considered the ques
tion for nearly two hours. None of
the speakers were inclined to deal
gently with the subject; indeed all
of them spoke from indignation.
At the close of the meeting resolu
tions were adopted severely censur
ing and condemning the articles in
the Examiner as well as the re
porter who was responsible for
them. The resolutions were strongly
worded, perhaps a little too
strongly, and made personal at the
same time, but still they only half
express the indignation which the
whole college feels.
The Socialist club which at the
last time of writing seemed likely
to be formed, had no foundation
whatever. The first placards were
put up by a freshman Socialist
whose over-zealousness in the cause
has been the subject of much
amusement. Failing to form a
club be has issued a, challenge to
both the Republicans and the Dem
ocrats, offering to meet one picked
man from each party in public de
bate before election daw Whether

he will get satisfaction remains to
he seen, for the cluhs have not yet
acted on his challenge.
There is little to write about foot
hall, save that practice goes steadily
on every day. The team receives
much support from the interest
that everyone is taking in its work.
There lias been a notable increase
in the number of spectators on the
Held during practice time, and the
enthusiasm shows no signs of abat
ing. Berkeley an.
