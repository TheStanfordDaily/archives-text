There has been considerable com
plaint during the present year by
the subscribers to the Daily Palo
Alto living in I'alo Altooll account
of the length of time that must
elapse after printing before they
can get their papers. An attempt
is being made by the management
to overcome this difficulty. If fifty
subscriptions can be added to the list
of those already taken in the town,
papers will be delivered there on
the evening of publication, as they
are at present on the campus. A
third of the necessary fifty are al
ready in. The co-operation of all
those interested in the success of
the effort is invited. Names may
be sent through the mail or handed
to L. 1. (i regory.
