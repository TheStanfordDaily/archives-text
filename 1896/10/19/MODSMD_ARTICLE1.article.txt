games have been this year—a farce.

the team; and lastly, the game it-j
self was too one-sided to be of any |
interest.
A small crowd paid the admis
sion fee and watched the game from
the bleachers. A few more such
exhibitions as this and the San ;
.Jose fiasco will demoralize the sport 1
beyond redemption.
The Freshman (?) team out
weighed the Oaklanders and could
rush the ball down the field at will.
