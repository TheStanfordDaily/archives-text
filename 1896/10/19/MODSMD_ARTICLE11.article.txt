Thk game at San Francisco last
Saturday between Berkeley and tlie
Olympics was witnessed liy a great
number of our eleven. The wisdom
of the management in taking men
to'the city to see these games can
not he too highly commended. For
example, the game put up by
Berkeley last Saturday convinced
the Stanford men present that our
team is not in anything like the
varsity form that U. C.'s is. While
it is true that Berkeley played her
best eleven, it is none the less true
that they put up a most excellent
game. The Varsity men who saw
the game should take it as a serious
lesson and learn it well.
