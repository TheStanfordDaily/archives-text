Prof. Abbott on last Thursday j
night began a series of lectures on !
Judge Story, which, judging from j
the lirst number, will prove very
interesting, lie said in part:
The life of Joseph Story is of es
pecial interest to us on account '
of the part he took in the formation j

of many of our institutions. He
was a hard student, always devot
ing some part of each day to study,
lie was ;i poet of no mean rank, an
orator nearly equal to Webster, an]
essayist, a letter writer â€”in which
occupations he did much toward]
modifying the Knglish opinion of j
our judges. He became a judge of]
the United States Supreme Court ]
at !he age of thirty-live, and handed
down many famous decisions,]
among others the Dartmouth Col
lege case. Fifteen volumes of his
decisions have been bequeathed to
posterity. He was also an author
of repute, writing books on con
stitutional law, conHiciions of laws,
commercial law, etc. As a man,
he was a good friend and a patri
otic citizen. lie held to the Uni
tarian fait ii and was a most liberal
Christian.
Justice Story-was born in 1779
and reared amongi he simple people
of Marblehead, Mass. He attended
a New England academy till the age
of fifteen, when he left that institu
tion and began to prepare for Har
vard. lie entered Harvard in 17D5.
At that time in Harvard, Latin.
Creek, algebra, natural philosophy,
astronomy, metaphysics, and his
tory were studied. These Story
mastered so thoroughly that he
graduated at the bead of his class,
writing the commencement poem.
He also distinguished himself dur
ing this period in a speech concern
ing the troubles, of Adam's admin
istration with France. During his
collegiate course he devoted himself
much to poetry and was the author
of many creditable productions.
Prof. Abbott interspersed his
lecture by readings from the auto
biography of Story and a biog
raphy written by his son.
