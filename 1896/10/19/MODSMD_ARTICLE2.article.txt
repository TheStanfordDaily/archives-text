# Friday's Practice.
## 
### 
The practice of Friday was of an ;
inferior order, when the length of
time during which the men have
been training is taken into consid
eration. The play was slow, and j
there was no interference to speak,
of. It is evident that there will
have to he great improvement in'
the work in general before we can ,
hope to equal Berkeley's snappy,
play.
Two unpardonable sins in the
football code are nightly committed ;
on our gridiron —high tackling and
failure to follow the bail. The 1 at-i
tcr is positively inexcusable and the
former is scarcely less so.
There were long runs galore on
Friday, Clematis, Freeman, Sea
wright, and Parker each calling
forth plaudits from the bleachers.
These runs were nearly all of the i
"star" order: that is, they were
made unassisted by interference.!
The best interference on the Held
was shown by Mcintosh. Higgles
had the record of stopping most of
the long runs. Blanchard and
Beckett, two husky freshmen, were
out for the first time, and though
very green at the game, should

prove valuable additions to the
Freshman team.
