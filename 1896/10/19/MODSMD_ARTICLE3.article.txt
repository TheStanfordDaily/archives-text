# Olympics-Berkeley.
## 
### 
The fastest game of football since
last Thanksgiving was seen at
Central Park last Saturday when
Berkeley and Olympic met on the
gridiron. The result was a victory
for 11. C. by the score of 24 to <S.
The game was viewed from the
sidelines by nearly all of the Stan
ford eleven.
The game did not go to Berkeley
as easy as the score would seem to
indicate. It was a hard tight, from
beginning to end. The tactics of
the two teams could be seen after
the first few downs. Olympic
trusted to her heavy men, and went
at the U. C. line viciously, forcing
the collegians slowly back. She
kept np this bucking through the
entire game, but the U. C. line
stood it very well. On the other
hand the Berkeley team ran the
Olympic ends very successfully-,
making good gains at every trial.
The club ends seemed powerless
to break up the interference or
stop the runner. The U. C. play
was quick and sharp and seemed
to demoralize their opponents.
Considering the short time they
have been under a coach, the col
lege eleven showed a wonderful de
velopment, while the athletic club
men seemed to play the same slug
gish game as at the beginning of
the season. Hall, Ransome, and
Simpson did the playing for Berk
eley, and Stiekney and Morse dis
tinguished I hen i selves for the Olym
pics. There was not a very large
crowd present, but Berkeley sent a
large number of rooters wh > kept
up au incessant yell at the success
of their eleven.
