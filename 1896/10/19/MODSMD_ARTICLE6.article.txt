# "THE CHRISTIAN ARGUMENT."
## Sunday Sermon by Dr. O. L. Elliott 
### 
Dr. Elliott preached yesterday
morning's sermon, choosing as a
text I Corinthians, i, 22-24: "For
the Jews require a sign, and the
Greeks seek after wisdom. Hut we
preach Christ crucified, unto the
Jews a stumbling-block, and unto
the Creeks foolishness. But unto
them which are called, both Jews
and Creeks, Christ the power of
Cod and the wisdom of Cod."
It is the fortune of most of us
who meet here today to have inher
ited the Puritan conscience. It is
not the same to us as to those in
whose blood the softer strains have
long flowed; for if we have strayed
far in thought and deed, and have
become unabashed in the deepest
experiences of the soul, even cutting
loose from every Puritan tradition,
yet we do it with a sense of pain
and loss not soon repaired.
The Puritan lived in a darkened
age; in him the saving elements of
society gathered themselves to
gether. Puritanism was hard and
narrow-minded, but robust. Jt
associated Cod, conscience, duty
with life, and however the intellect
was stripped and tricked, the life
was transformed.
The intellectual problems of to
day are not the same as in St.
Paul's time. But the Roman, Jew,
and Creek were alike dim in their
religious faith. To both Jew and
Creek Paul preached Christ cruci
fied. Christianity is not a science,
and religion does not contradict
knowledge, but it says that if Cod
were even anywhere present in the
phenomena of life, He must be al
ways and everywhere present.
To St. Paul Christianity satisfied
every test of reason. He saw that
logic has no power to touch the
springs of life. He saw Christian
ity as a life, a principle of action,
a relation between Cod and man.
Christianity is the same whether
philosophy be Ptolemaic or Coper
nicaii, flat or evolutionary. It does
not assume to solve any of the
problems which are as old jis
human life. ' Follow me." "Come
unto me.'' He who sees nothing
more in his Bible than ethical data
has missed its import. .Jesus'
message was bound up in his per
sonality because his life was the
message. He put himself at the
bead of no movement but went
about doing the simple deeds of
service. Jesus looked to see the
whole world tranfsornied and hu
man life made divine through this
power of love and service.
Life and immortality have been
brought to light through the Cos
pels: and immortality, not because
Jesus returned from the life lieyond
the grave, but through that unerr
ing spiritual instinct, that insight
into the eternity of life, which is
shared with us through his win
some and overmastering personal
ity.
If one does not listen for the di
vine voice, he surely will not hear
it. There are those who find in the
high converse of poetry and nature
stimulus to religious life Christ
ianity has no quarrel with any who
have walked and talked with God
and called him by some other
name; yet the Church, with its

treasured experiences, its solemn
services and associations, is the
special guardian and conservor of
the religious life.
We hear of the intellectual neces
sity of breaking away from the
Church, whose creed we have out
grown. There is joy in heaven
over one sinner that repenteth, not
of Methodist turned Presbyterian
or Catholic.
The Christian verities are these:
"And now abideth Faith, Hope,
Love," "The fruit of the spirit is
love," "Love is of God."
