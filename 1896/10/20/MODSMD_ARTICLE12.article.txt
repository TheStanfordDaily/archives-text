The management of the Daily
Palo Alto has signified its inten
tion of having the paper delivered
in Palo Alto on the day of publica
tion, provided, however, that (iftv
additional subscriptions can be ob
tained. The management would
incur expense in making this
change, which would necessitate
compensation in the form of new
subscriptions. The advantage and
convenience of an evening delivery
to subsribers in Palo Alto are very
apparent, and can be secured if
everyone desirous of the change co
operates with the management in
its new enterprise. The venture
deserves encouragement and suc
cess, and we invite the assistance
and co-operation of the residents of
Palo Alto.
