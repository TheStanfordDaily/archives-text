# Roughness in Games.

Basket-bit 11 lias fallen from its
pedestal. It fell in Camden, in
New .Jersey, where it was played at
the Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation, and where the hoard of
governors of that body condemned
the game as too brutal t<> be played
ina Christian organization.
The tender-hearted who years ago
rejected foot bull as a sport to be
classed only with bull-lighting and
the sanguinary combats of gladia
tors, turned to basket-ball with
fond hopes of a better order of
things. They thought that, in this
lady-like pastime nose-guards and
shin-pads would not be needed, a ltd
that Chesterfieldian courtesy rather
than Millivanic aggressiveness
might be the most conspicuous fea
ture of the sport. They even be
lieved the game was suitable for
our college girls, and inconsequence
ii was introduced at Smith and
Vassar and Wellesley, where il at
once became popular and led to the
formation of numerous basket-ball
teams.
Now that Camden finds that
basket-ball has caused bruises and
broken limbs, it adds the game to
the black list where football has
been inscribed. There is still the
I {add iff e sport, battle-ball, invented
bv Dr. I). A. Sargent as a suitable
exercise for classical Cambridge
girls; and there is that Newton in
vention, push-ball, which consists
in trying to get a six-foot, leather
sphere up on one's shoulders as
Atlas was wont to place the earth
upon his broad frame. Either of
these games can be developed into
a bruta 1 sport in time.
The moral of the degeneration of
these pastimes is that brutality is
not inherent in games but in play
ers. The roughness of a sport gen
erally depends upon the fashion in
which it is played. A pack of cards
by the family hearth leads to no
irritation in domestic happiness,
while the same pack in a mining
camp may lead to bloodshed. When
rivalry is established, it must be
gratified. Whocan doubt that Mr.
Corbett and Mr. Fitzsimnions, if
seated on opposite sides of a back
gammon board, would come to
blows before either won?
Camden should think before it
condemns hasket-ball as unlit for
Christians. Perhaps the Christians
who brought it into disrepute were
unlit for basket-ball. — Boston
