# Snappy Play.
## 
### 
At last it lias dawned upon the
intellects of the men of our football
contingent that quick play is a
quality absolutely necessary to suc
cess on the gridiron. Berkeley, in
her game against Olympic on Sat
urday, showed that snappy play
will win a game in spite of superior
weight and strength. The fact that
Olympic was ahle to score twice
was proof that Berkeley was weak
in defensive work and probably
would have lost the game had it
not been for the quick play of the
varsity backs.
Last night's practice gave proof
that our men had profited by
Berkeley's example, and we may ex
pect to see last playing from now
on. The signals were given and
the men were in motion far quicker
last night than heretofore. The
chief drawback to very fast work
seemed to be the fact that the men
were unacquainted with the signals,
making it necessary to repeat them
again and again. A week of such
work, however, should remedy this
minor fault.
Mr. Cros* worked as hard as any
player last night and his enthusi
asm had the effect of making the
men buckle down with a will.
The Varsity line, except in one
or two places, was as stiff as a stone
wall. The second team could make
very few gains through it. The
weak spot in the team lies in the
failure of the halfbacks to ward off
the ends in order to protect the
runner. The backs, with one or
two exceptions, seem to think that
it is sufficient if they make a bluff
at running interference No thor
ough tackier can be intimidated by
a mere show of fierceness. He will
give up only when he has been
knocked off his feet by a well-di
rected shoulder thrust.
The spectators took a lively in
terest in the game and did their
utmost to encourage the men.
Manager Brown had put the
field in capital condition and alto
gether the practice was very r-atis
factory.

Jeffs was out for the first time
this season and played a good game.
He was down the field like a shot
the first kick-off and tackled 13.
Thomas before he could move.
"Heft"' Williams at one point of
the game captured the ball on one
of Soper's ''muffs" and made a
touchdown from the center of
the lield, while the second team
looked on without attempting
to stop him.
James played a remarkably
strong game at guard. His op
ponent was almost powerless against
him.
Harrington also did some showy
work in his position, l'arker made
several good tackles, and Mc
intosh did some good defensive
work.
Dole and Cotton made some
splendid gains, the latter leading
easily in line-bucking The punt
ing on both sides was of a superior
order.
