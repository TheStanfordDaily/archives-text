j One of the largest and most en
i thusiastic political meetings held
iin Han Francisco this campaign
was the intercollegiate Bryan rati-
I fication held at Metropolitan
j Temple last Saturday night. The
hall \v;is packed at half-past seven,
an hour before the meeting was
called to order, and the college men
kept the enthusiasm with a round
of cheers and yells.
The hall was tastefully decorated
in colors of the two universities,
the right side being a bank of car
dinal, the left a profusion of blue
I and gold.
Chairman Baker of the Bimetallic
; League had been chosen by the
Stanford club as president of the
| evening, and at half-past eight
I called the meeting to order. In a
few words he reviewed the political
I situation, and called upon S. P.
| Eli as of Stanford as the first
! speaker of the evening.
After the Stanford yell had been
I given with vigor Elias spoke
!of the aspect of politics at the Uni
versity, the success of the Bryan
Club, and continued by denying
[ the statement that there were not
| enough Democrats on the campus
the lirst of the semester to form a
j political organization. He then
| gave a short history of monetary
i legislation in the United States,
| discussed the demonetization of sil
ver, and touched upon its immedi
ate and permanent results.
President Miller of the Berkeley
Bryan Club, who showed himself
j to be an orator of considerable ahi 1 -
! ity, followed in a short discussion
lof the important questions of the
j campaign. He closed his remarks
with a statement that brought forth
enthusiastic applause, that he was
; glad on casting his lirst ballot t<» be
j able to register the same for Bryan.
At the close of Mr. Miller's re
; marks the Stanford Mandolin Club
! rendered several selections which
! were well received.
Mr. A. B. Morgan of Stanford
won the honors of the evening. I n
an easy address he touched upon
the debatable points in the silver
i question, and discussed the fall in
prices, repudiation, and the relation
between debtor and creditor. His
[speech was listened to with marked
! interest, and at its close he was
i greeted with enthusiastic applause.
The plaudits given Mr. Morgan
for his efforts were repeated when
Mr. H. E. Church of Hastings Law
I School began his remarks. Mr.
Church proved himself to be a mas
ter in original wit and humor, and
kept the audience in good nature
throughout his speech.
At the conclusion of Mr.Church's
remarks the Delta IJpsilon quartet
of Berkeley rendered several lively
campaign songs, whereupon Gov
ernor Budd took the platform as the
principal speaker of the evening,
and he devoted his time chiefly to
a review of our financial system.
At the close of Governor Budd's
address the Stanford and the
Berkeley yells were vigorously
•liven by the students present, and
the audience joined in three cheers
for Bryan.
