# THE
						SONATA'S DEVELOPMENT
## A
						Series of Piano Recitations, by Miss Ina Griffin. 
### 
The history of the Sonata, we
nre told, is the history of an at-1
tempt to bring out of sound alone, j
without explanation hy title or
text, without aid of voices. 'Mongj
work* which shall not only pene
trate and stir us in detail, hut j
which are in their entire mass,
direct, consistent, convincing"
This attempt requires the solution j
of one of ''the most singular proh-j
leitis ever presented to the mind
of men," and its successful result
in its completed and most severely j
ahst ract form is t lie Sonata.
The history of any great intel-1
lectual achievement is interesting:
for itself alone; and the exposition
of such a history accompanied by.
artistic illustration affords not only
intellectual satisfaction to a high j
degree, hut great pleasure and de
i i.
light.
.Music lovers of Stanford I ni-,
versitv are fortunate in having the
rare opportunity to enjoy such j
exposition and illustration hy so j
gifted an artist as Miss Griffin is j
known to he.
