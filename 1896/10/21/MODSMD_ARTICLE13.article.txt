In a body of students as large as
the one at Stanford it is plain that
in a year's time there will he many
cases of serious illness. Such heing
the state of affairs, the wise thing
to do is to he prepared. We have
here at Stanford no way of taking
care of very sick students. When
such cases occur the patients must
he removed to the hospital at San
â€¢lose or to San Francisco. In most
cases of serious illness the removal
of the patient a distance of twenty
or thirty miles is a dangerous mat
ter and is apt to produce fatal re
sults. We have had one instance
in the recent death of one of our
students in the hospital at San
Jose. *
Of course we can not found a hos
pital at the University, nor would
we wish to perhaps, hut it might
prove a good plan if there were a
good trained nurse at the I*Diver
sity ready at any time to take
charge of such students as might he
unlucky enough to he sick.
Could not the Students' Guild
employ a nurse? It would seem to
he within the province of this hody
to do so. This question is one of

great importance, unci it dem ituls
the thought of every student in the
U ni versii y.
