Editor Daily Palo Alto: I de
sire to correct a mis-statement in
regard to the "Domestic Course'' at
Wellesley College, now going the
rounds of the newspapers, which
has heen quoted recently hy you.
Since the foundation of Wellesley
College every student has heen re
quired to do forty-live minutes of
"domestic work" per day. This
lahor consisted in dish washing,
sweeping, dusting, janitor work,
and petty personal services for the
professors. No instruction in do
mestic science was given in con
nection with it. In recent years at
least, the system has only heen re
tained from motives of economy
li will hardly he questioned that
Wellesley lias taken a step forward
in doing away with a system which
was not only of no educational
value hut which added greatly to
tlie nervous strain of dormitory
life. Lack of endowments only,
prevents the expansion of the
course of instruction in Domestic
Science, established at Wellesley
hv Miss Ta I hot, now dean of the
woman's department at the Uni
versity of Chicago. Very respect
fully,' M. 11. S.
