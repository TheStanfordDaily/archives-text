# Unpromising Work.

### 
Last night's practice was en
tirely unsatisfactory. The team
work was lamentably weak. I here
was absolutely n<> visilÂ»U* improve
ment over the play of the beginning
of the season, nor was there even
that snappy element so noticeable
on the preceding evening.
The men as a whole fail to show
that degree of physical tilness that
is to be looked for after a month's
training. They seem unable to
stand even a limited amount of fast
play, and we may expect to see
considerable "'faking for wind'"
when the Varsity meets Reliance
Saturday, unless a great change
t a kes place in 11 le mea lit i me.
An onlooker could not fail to re
mark the comparative strength of
the second eleven last night. The
Yarsitv was able to make but one
touchdown in the time in which of
late it has made three. Its weakest
point was in t he inability of the
backs to get the ball on a pass.
I'll is was caused for the must part
bv the fullback cutting in between
(piarter and halfback and spoiling
the pass.
This ragged exhibition began at
.">;!() ;ind consisted of two periods of

fifteen and Hveminute* respectively.
The full quota of men did not put in
an appearance until fully o o'clock,
thus doing away with a great
amount of the preliminary work.
Cotton's line hacking was a fea
ture of the practice. He does the
licst work of any of the men in that
line. Never missing an opening,
he ploughs through for his distance
every time.
To Straight belongs the credit of
I he only touchdown of the evening.
He made a capital run I nun his po
sition at end and touched the hall
down behind the goa I li lie.
Mcintosh, as quarter on the sec
ond team, played a strong game,
breaking up a number of the Var
sity plavs and tackling all over the
field. Fickert played a consistent
game throughout and was in every
play. Jeffs played his usual game,
which is saying a great deal. Jost,
Kice, Leavitt, and Madden deserve
mention for their tackling. The
least said of the punting the better,
for of all the kicks attempted there
was not one worthy of notice.
The line-up:
