alumni for money.
Columbia will not hold her usual
fall regatta this year.
A new chapel, costing $100,000,
is to he erected at Welleslev.
The strained relations between
Yale and Harvard in athletics still
continue.
College newspaper sentiment in
the East is strongly in favor of the
American Henley.
The famous I'oe family is again
represented on the Princeton grid
iron by a freshman candidate for
quarter-hack.
At a recent meeting of the soph
omore class of the University of
North Carolina resolutions were
adopted abolishing hazing.
Columbia's athletic system has
been changed. A committee of
eighteen graduates has been chosen
for the term of one year, nine to at
tend to the rowing and nine to the
general athletics. It is hoped that
athletics at Columbia may be
placed on a firmer basis by this
change, and that she may be rep
resented by a varsity football team
next year.
