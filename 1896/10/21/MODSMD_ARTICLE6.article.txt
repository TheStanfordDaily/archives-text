The subject of Prof. Mi'Farland's
lecture Tuesday evening was"The!
zoological station at Naples." After
a short introduction there followed
a series of stereopticon views of the
station, the city, and the hay ofj
Naples.
l'rof. McFarland said, in short:
An enormousst iniulus was given to |
hiology hy a paper read >y Darwin j
•July 1, 18()8. It was due to this
paper that the Held of biology,
which has been greatly enlarged,'
has become specialized. Previous
to this there bad been no general
principle underlying science, no
definite idea of the relation of
forms to each other.
In the study of organic life our
goal has changed; our endeavor to
study is not so much to tind a new
animal, although this is an ex
tremely important factor, but our
goal has centered itself about the
individual cell.
The first and greatest zoological
station was founded at Naples by a
pupil of Darwin, Anton Dorn. ll
is situated in a perfect wilderness
of beauty. The bay of Naples
unites rarity of beauty with inter
est for the antiquarian, biologist,
zoologist, and botanist.
Dorn, having secured the influ
ence of German princes and the
German government, completed
and opened the building in 1884 on
a very large scale. The govern
ment of Germany granted him
80,000 marks to carry out ins pro
ject. The building i« fitted out
with laboratories and the best zoo
logical library in the world; it is
provided with all appliances and
every convenience possible Al
though it is the very first ever
built it is the central station of all
zoological stations in the world.
Since that time Naples has been
the Mecca of the biologist.
The zoological station has also a
public aquarium, one of the finest
in the world, tilled with all the
specimens found in the Mediterra
nean. This aquarium is a very im
portant factor in the income of the
station.
Altogether, the condition of
things from a biologist's point of
view, is ideal. The zoological station
is equipped in the most elaborate
fashion for collecting specimens;
the student can visit the animals in
their native haunts. No in>true
tion or lectures are given at the
station, and each man works in
dependently.
