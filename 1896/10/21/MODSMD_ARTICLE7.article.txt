Harriet \V. Preston, and the i 11 us- j

The prospectus sent out by Doxey
has this to say about the work:
"In this exquisite book of fairy i
tab's, M. Hrun has given us some-1
tiling new, valuable, and entertain
ing in literature. Interest in the
study of folk-lore is growing to the j
extent that one may not consider j
himself well versed without intelli-j
gent knowledge of this fascinating |
branch of belles lettres. I he pro
vinces of Southern France are a rich
field of reminiscent folk-lore, and

; these tales of Languedoc a rewritten
| by one horn and reared in the midst
of them; hence every touch of the
j simple, homely life of the peasantry
is a true one. A blend of quaint
j superstitions and beautiful fancies,
j the traditions remain as purely
i original and free of change as the
| customs of the provinces and the
j coifs of the humble women, being
| banded down from parents to child
ren. through generations.
"It is certain that many, if not all
j the tales in this collection, are re
i peated in print here for the first
j time, as they were related to the
writer by an octogenarian great
; uncle, whose memory reverted to
the days of the great Revolution
(and who knew every foot of ground
jand every peculiarity of people in
this romanee land.
" The tales are sweet, wholesome,
land attractive as fairy creations,
I were they purely imaginative, but
i when we consider that they pre
serve for us an actual and dis
junctive element in peasant life in
this most delightsome nook of
| sunny France, the incomparable
value of a faithful and reliable
work like this one by Professor
lirun to student, general reader,
and conversationalist, becomes em
phatically manifest.
' The illustrations are of Ernest
Peixotto's best work, and Peixotto
is an artist who, confessedly, takes
I rank with Pennell and Vierge. He
has studied scene and character in
Languedoc, and his designs are
finely sympathetic with the text.
The introduction, by Harriet W.
Preston, whose translations of
j Mistral's writings have made them
dear to English readers, is fitting
| prelude to tbe entertainment that
i follows.
''It is proposed to i.-<sue a special
| subscription edition, known as
I'Stanford Edition of Tales of Lan
guedoc,' to be beautifully bound in
; the University colors, with the
frontispiece specially printed on im
perial .J apa nese pa per. This edi
tion will be numbered and allotted
| in the order in which subscriptions
are received."
