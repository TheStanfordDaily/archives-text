# EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.
## Action Relative to the Northern Trip. 
### 
The Executive Committee of the
Associated Students met last even
ing to discuss the matter of allow
ing the Glee and Mandolin Clubs
to go on a northern trip. The clubs 1
were represented by their managers
who made a strong plea for consent
to make the tour. After a lengthy
discussion the following measure
was proposed by the committee and
adopted:
The Glee and Mandolin Clubs. |
comprising twenty-one men, will be I
allowed to take the northern trip
upon the following considerations: j
1. That before making any con-1
tracts whatsoever each man propos-1
ing to go on this trip shall deposit
before Nov. 1, 1896, with the treas-,
urer of the Associated .Students, his;
promissory note for the amount of j
twenty-live dollars as a guarantee
that he will place the said amount
in cash in the hands of the treas-1
urer fourteen days before the clubs
leave on their northern trip.
2. That under no consideration!
shall the clubs lÂ»e allowed to leave
unless the said amount, of twenty-!
five dollars is deposited by each;
man with the treasure; of the Asso-j
ciated Students fourteen days be
fore the clubs leave; provided, how
ever, that all amounts made by!
the clubs between now and
Thanksgiving shall go towards
Ihe liquidation of the old debt now
standing against the Associated;
Students incurred by the clubs last j
year, and that all amounts in ex
cess of this debt made by the clubs)
before fourteen days previous to j
starling north shall be accepted as
part of the guarantee.
Provided, further, that if any |
money is made by this northern
trip above expenses, fifty per cent.;
of the net proceeds shall be allowed!
the clubs to go towards the liqui-j
dation of the debt of $150 due to j
Chris Hemic by the individual
members of the clubs, provided that:
said liftv percent, shall not exceed!
$ 150.
The musical organizations have!
decided to appeal from this action
of the committee to the Associated!
Students, and a meeting of ihestu-j
dent body will be held tomorrow to!
give the clubs a final hearing.
