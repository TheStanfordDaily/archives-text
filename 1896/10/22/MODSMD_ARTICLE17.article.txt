Kditor Daily Palo Ai/ro: The
result of last Saturday is looked
upon here as very satisfactory. To
have defeated the Olympics with a
score of 24 to N seems to those of us
most interested in football to speak
well for the work of our team. In
teresting as the game was to every
body, fora few, whose attention is
(•entered on the personnel of the li
nal eleven, it was especially signifi
cant, in that it showed the weak
ness and the strength of the men,
hoth individually and in combina
tion. Suffice it to say that the
weak points noted then will be
carefully remedied in ihe daily
practice, while the score, so hugely
in our favor, helps vet more to jus
tify the confidence which we feel in
the effectiveness <»112 the team.
Training quarters for the players
were opened at the beginning of the
week. Twenty of them are in the
house now.
The president of the Associated
Students is in receipt of a communi
cation from the Citizens' Charter
Association and the Citizens' Non
partisan Association of San Fran
cisco. These two organizations,
whose object is to prevent fraud at
the counting of election votes in the
city, have addressed to the student
body a proposition which, if acted
upon favorably, may establish a
precedent to be kept up for years to
corue. It seems that the associa
tions have difficulty in finding a
set of men whose fidelity in such
work can be relied upon. They
propose to us, therefore, that we, as
a student body, assist tliein in this
work on behalf of public honesty,
bv appointing individual members
of our body to co-operate with
t hem.
Undoubtedly if the plan seems at
all practicahie the Associated Stu
dent:- will act upon it favorably. It
will appeal to the public spirit of
the men, and it is thought that
they will accord with the plan wil
lingly. A similar appeal it seems
was made to the students of Co
lumbia College at the last election
in New York, and this of itself is
said to have contributed in no
small part to the success which at
that time the reform movement,
achieved.
The niuch-spoken-of tents which
were to be set up on the campus
have made their appearance. They
are placed in front, of the library
building, facing North and South
Halls, but no definite use has been
made of them yet. Bkkkklkyan.
