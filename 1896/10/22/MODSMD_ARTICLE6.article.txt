# All Off Day for the Varsity.
## 
### 
The Varsity had an off day yes
terday. while the second team took

turns in starring. As a result the
second team scored a touchdown
and a safety against their mighty
rivals.
The second team not only had
the advantage in the aggressive
play hut held the Varsity down in
defensive work as well. The suc
cess of the second team can not be
ascribed t<» superior team work, for
there was none shown. It was due
entirely to the fact that its members
knew thoroughly the signals of
their opponents and were able thus
to bunch the backs on whichever
end the first team attempted to
circle (for the Varsity efforts were
entirely devoted to end running);
thus the play was broken up before
the interference could be put in mo
tion.
The men were again late in com
ing out last night, thus putting the
practice off until a late hour. Rich,
the ex-tackle, Frankenheimer, and
Downing were on hand 10 assist in
coaching the teams.
The playing was faulty io many
ways. There was a. great deal of
high tackling, and the men lost the
ball entirely too easily after being
tack led.
Murphy did the best punting
and running through a scattered
field that has been seen this year,
lie alternated as quarter and full
back on the second team, and in
the latter position made the best
showing of any man who has tried
for that position this year. At one
point in the game he caught a
punted ;>all at the center of the
field and made a touchdown.
lvobinson also made a capital
run and was downed in an exceed
ingly clever manner by H. Thomas.
Thomas is playing one of the best

garnets at halfback on tlie field.
His its not showy work but he in to
he depended upon for sure and con
scientious playing.
Straight and Jeffs made some
good runs and LI. Smith played a
strong giime at end. Robinson and
Clemang tackled very well.
