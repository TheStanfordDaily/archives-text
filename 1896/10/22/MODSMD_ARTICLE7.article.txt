The much-talked-of forensic
meeting between the political clubs
representing the different sides in
national politics will occur Friday

ably be the greatest. Dr. Jordan
has been engaged to preside and
the political clubs of the surround
ing districts have been invited to
attend. The silver question will be
treated; Morgan, '98, and Snedden,
'9<S, will take the side of the- white
metal, while lioss, '97, and Sheldon,
'96, will support gold. Twenty
minutes will be allowed each
speaker.
