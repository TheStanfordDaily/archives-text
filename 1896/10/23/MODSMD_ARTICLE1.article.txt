# EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE UPHELD.
## The 						Associated Students Vote to Uphold the Decision of Their Representatives. Glee and Mandolin Clubs Defeated. 
### 
If all the meetings of the Associ
ated Students tliis year are to he as
interesting and exciting as was the
one held in the chapel this after
noon we certainly have glorious
times ahead of us. It was the first
meeting of the student body held
this year, and long before time to
commence, standing room in the
hall was at a premium.
President Pomeroy rapped for or
der at 1:50 p.m., and stated the ob
ject of the meeting to he the pro
posed northern trip of the Glee and
Mandolin Clubs during the Christ
mas vacation. The secretary was
instructed to read the decision of
the Executive Committee of the As
sociated Students on this matter,
which had not met the approval ot
the musical organizations and from
which they had appealed. The de
cision shorn of all embellishment
was to the effect that the clubs
should be allowed to take the pro
posed trip, provided that a deposit
of twenty-live dollars was made by
each member as a guarantee of the
financial success of the undertak
ing.
Aaron, '97. moved that the action
of the Executive Committee be up
held. The remarks on this motion
brought forth the expected deluge
of arguments and protests, and for
nerrly an hour oratory and persua
sion held full sway. Wilson, '96,
moved an amendment to the origi
nal motion which, when declared
out of order by the chair, elicited
an earnest protest on the part of
itie musical club men. On appeal
to the house the meeting by a (Hose
vote sustained the decision of the
chair.
Schwartz, 99, on behalf of the
Kxecutive Committee, spoke of the
great desire of that body to accom
modate the clubs and send them on
the proposed trip free from any
conditions whatsoever, but he said
that the present financial.condition
of the student body treasury de
manded that they exact some guar
antee to protect them from the
risks which they assumed in allow
ing the clubs to go North. The in
itial expenses of'the trip had to be
met in some way and it would be
as easy for the members of the
clubs to raise the money as it would
,ie for the student body in its pres
ent financial condition to borrow
the amount. In view of the fact
that each man's expenses would be
paid for two weeks and that he
would certainly have to have twen
ty-live dollars at the beginning of
the vacation to meet his expenses if
he staid on the campus, he could
-ee no reason why the members
should object to depositing the
guarantee, especially if they really
believed the trip would be a finan
cial success.
Wells. ".>7, took the floor in de
fense of the musical organizations
and spoke of the great and neces
sarv incentive of a trip to the ef
fective work of the clubs. He also
presented figures of the carefully es
timated receipts and expenditures
of the proposed journey, showing

that the former exceeded the latter
by nearly six hundred dollars.
Treasurer Morrison attacked
these statements, claiming that al
though the estimate of expenses
was nearly correct, yet there could
be no reliable estimates of the ex
pected receipts, lie reasserted that
the Executive Committee were mak
ing no attempts to bulldoze the mu
sical clubs, but that the condition
of the student body required that
it take this action to defend it
self.
Wilson, '97, contended that the
financial report of the southern trip
last, spring could not he taken as a
criterion for the one now agitated,
inasmuch as the former was admit
tedly, though perhaps excusably,
marked by poor business manage
ment. He stated that the members
of the clubs had expressed them
selves as personally unable to ob
tain the demanded guarantee.
Sheldon, '96, spoke in favor of
the action of the Kxecutive Com
mittee, and denied some of the ar
guments of the protesting club
men.
Upon the conclusion of Sheldon's
remarks the previous question was
ordered, and by a vote of 23H to (5-4
the Associated Students sustained
the decision of their Kxecutive
Committee. This leaves the matter
practically where it was before the
meeting. A motion to adjourn was
carried by a rising vote.
