In all the large universities tlie
men of particular sections of the
country will he found organized
into clubs including the men from
one state or group of states. These
clubs not only bring together men
whose homes are near each other,
but they also help by co-operation
to extend the fame of the mother
institution at home. By glancing
at last year's register of students at
Stanford it will be apparent that

California, Washington, Oregon,
Illinois, and New York each had a
representation here large enough to
establish a club of verv respectable
proportions; and that Iowa, Mis
souri, Colorado, Ohio, Utah, Indi
ana, New England, and Canada
might each have had clubs slightly
smaller. Each state may not be
represented by so many students
this year as last, hut there is ma
terial enough from most of them
still to form flourishing clubs. It
is worth trying.
