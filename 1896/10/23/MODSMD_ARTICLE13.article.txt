The following extracts from
Roberts' Rules of Order, the «•«»11 sti
tut ion a 1 authority of the Associated
Students, go to show that Mr.
Pomeroy erred in ruling out of
order the motion to amend the
Executive Committee's report:
Roberts' Rules of Order, Sec. ;»1.
When the assembly is to consider
;i report, a motion should be made
''to adopt," "In accept," or "agree
to" the report. . . . After either
of the above motions is made the
report is open to amendment, and
the matter stands before the assem
bly exactly the same as if there
had been no committee, and the
subject had been introduced by the
motion of the member who made
t he report.
Sec. 28. An amendment may be
inconsistent with one already
adopted or may directly conflict
with the original motion, but it
must have a direct bearing upon
the subject of that motion. To il
lustrate: A motion fora vote of
thanks could be amended by sub
stituting for "thanks" ihe word
'"censure."
I was myself in favor of the re
port of the Executive Committee,
but no one should uphold a ruling
of the president when it is mani
festly wrong. E. R. /ion.
