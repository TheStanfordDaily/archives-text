### 
The third Law lecture of this year's
series was given in the chemistry
lecture room last night by Prof.
F. J. Polley. The subject was
''Sharp practices among the early
California lawyers," and in his in
troductory remarks he took oc
casion to say that his lectures were
intended primarily as an hour of
recreation and therefore would
only include humorous subjects.
'In early California practice at
torneys were without books and
judges were without precedent,"
said Prof. Polley, "and that ac
counts for some of the quirks to
which they had to resort."
Continuing, he told of a breach
of promise suit and how it was
peculiarly disposed of in a Cal
ifornia court. A young miner pay
ing attention to a servant had
said that he would marry her
when he possessed a thousand dol
lars. Tliis fortune by diligence
soon reached $20,000. Then the
servant trirl brought suit for breach
of promise. The only defense at
tempted by the miner was that
Molly was a good one thousand
dollar wife but as his conditions
had changed he now needed a twenty
thousand dollar wife, and, he added,
'"She ain't none such."
Prof. Polley also told of a young
attorney who upon his first appear
ance in court kept ti|> a continual
tire of "I object, I object." The
judge having each time overruled
his objections the latter finally
shouted "Am 1 a fool or not?" The
judge with all possible gravity re
plied. "That is a question for the
consideration of the jury."
At the conclusion of the hour
Prof. Polley announced that unless
notice was given to the contrary
the lectures in the future would be
given on Wednesday evenings.
