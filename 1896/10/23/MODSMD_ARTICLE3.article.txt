# Tomorrow's Game.
## 
### 
1 he game tomorrow between Stan
ford and Reliance should be closely
contested. If our team plays the
game that it did last night the odds
should be rather in our favor. As
will be seen from the line-up, we
shall have to meet about the same
team that we did in the early part
of the season. Much may depend
in this struggle upon the encourage
ment given the players by their
supporters, and it is obviously im
portant that Stanford should have
a large delegation of rooters present.
There will probably be many
changes in the line-up during the
game, as most of the promising
candidates will be given a chance
to show of what mettle they are
made.
The probable line-up:
STA N FOR I). RE LIA NCE.
Jeffs 1 end r Lanyon

Additional interest attaches to
this game owing to the fact that
the Pacific Athletic Association has
offered a trophy valued at $35.00
to the team making the best record
throughout the season.
As it stands now, Reliance has a
clear record and hence a score of
1,000 points, as the tie between
Olympic and Stanford will probably
not be counted; Stanford has an
equal number of points, while
Berkeley and Olympic; each having
lost a game, are tied for second
place. Hence, if we can win this
game, we shall have the lead over
all the others.
The game will be called at 3
o'clock at Central Park. Admission
fifty cents.
