# A 						Stiff Practice.
## 
### 
The playing of both teams last
night was of a high order As a
rule the play was snappy and clean
cut. The Varsity did all of the
scoring, and contrary to the rule of
late did it more through team work
than by means of individual plays.
At the same time the second eleven
played a strong game.
Although the result of last night's
practice is gratifying, nevertheless
we can not lose sight of the fact
that the Varsity's playing is er
ratic. So far this week we have
seen two capital practices and two
that were very poor. A team is
not in trim«to win until it can put
up a consistent game day after day.
The Freshman team practiced
signals under the direction of Down
ing and Rich before the regular
practice. The infant team made a
good appearance as regards ma
terial, and with conscientious train
ing should put a winning eleven in
the field on the day of the Fresh
man game.
The Varsity backs all came in
fora share of the ground gaining.
Clemans, Fisher, and Seawright

made the best gains, closely fol
lowed by B. Thomas. Jost did
some creditable line-bucking for
the second team. The backs still
show weakness in their interference.
Some of the heaviest men behind
the line seem unable to do effective
blocking. They seldom fail to hit
the tackier, but rarely prevent him
from tackling.
The longest runs and the best
line-bucking were done by line
men. In the former Straight led,
while Cotton's charges through the
line were splendid; especially is
this so of his gain through tackle
when he made the lust touchdown.
Harrington aided Cotton greatly
by making good openings. Har
rington himself made good gains
through the line.
Hay Smith's tackling was one of
the features of the practice. He
has a knack of crouching low until
the interference has past and then
nabbing the runner before any
gain can be made. Parker, Straight,
and Mcintosh also tackled well.
Williams at center and Rice at
tackle held down their positions in
good shape.
The punting by Clemans and
Murphy was very good.
