# THE 						CARDINAL WINS.
## Stanford Defeats Reliance by a Score of 10 to 0. 
### 
Stanford and Reliance met in a
schedule game at Central Park Sat
urday for the first time this season,
and Stanford won. The playing
was of a rather jagged order, es
pecially on the part of the athletic
club. There was no clean-cut in
terference shown, and Stanford's
victory is to he attributed to the re
markably strong showing made by
its line.
The Varsity backs were lament
ably weak on defensive play, and
had it not been for the clever play
of t he linemen the score might have
been entirely different.
A point that counted greatly
against Reliance was the inability
of Arlitt to calch a punted ball.
He invariably dropped the ball al
ter getting his hands on it, thusen
abling Stanford to capture it.
Taken all in all the game was not
such as greatly to encourage as to
the result of the big game.
•"lleff" Williams played the star
game for the Cardinal. He put' up
the finest game at center that has
probably ever beeir seen on the
Coast. He seemed to be in every
play, tackling and getting down the
field with the ends, blocking kicks,
and fa I li ng on the ball in a most re
markable manner.
Captain Fickert also put up a
strong game, playing all over the
Held. Cotton was another man
who distinguished himself. Dole,
who took Seawright's place in the
second half, made some splendid
gains through the line. Murphy
managed the team very well but
his tackling was decidedly poor.
Twice, at critical points in the
game, he allowed the runners to
slip from him when he bad clean
chances to down them, and had it
not been for the remarkable work
of the linemen these runs would
undoubtedly have resulted in touch
downs.
There was a great deal of punt
ing in the second half, and during
the early part of the game the pig
skin was in Stanford territory, but
towards the end of the half Stan
ford recovered the ball after Walton
had failed to catch a punt, and by
Dole's line hue,king a touch-down
was made. Murphy tried for goal.
Walton jumped to block the ball
and touched it, forcing it between
the goal posts. The goal was not
counted. Score, 10 to ().
After the next kick-off Stanford
managed to bring the ball, by punts
and line bucking, to the Reliance
six-yard goal line, where it rested
at t lie call of time.^
