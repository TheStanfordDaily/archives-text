The recent cases of serious ill
ness on the campus, resulting in
two instances in death, again calls
to mind and emphasizes the need
of a nurse or some competent per
son to attend regularly to critical
cases, which occur too suddenly for
good attendance to he procured.
As the Students' (iuild is the
only relief organization on the
campus it seems that this matter
falls within their province. As the
students and others contribute to
the support of this institution it
would seem incumbent upon its
oflicers to take some action immedi
ately. At any rate it might be
well to take the matter under con- j
sideration and make a statement i
to the student body as to what can
he done.
