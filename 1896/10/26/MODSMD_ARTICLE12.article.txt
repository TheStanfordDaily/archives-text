# THE 						LAST GUN.
## Silver and Gold Advocates End the Campaign by a Joint Debate. 
### 
The "hoy orators" of both sides
hail a chance at each other Friday
night. The occasion was the joint
debate between the forces of gold
and silver, represented respectively
by the McKinley and Bryan clubs.
Kor two hours the four speakers ex
plained, more or less lucidly, their
attitudes on the subject of free coin
age, the other issues of the cam
paign being by mutual consent left
entirely alone. There was a good
attendance, and the audience, as
befits a campaign meeting, was en
thusiastic in the extreme.
Dr. Jordan presided. After jok
ing a little at the expense of the
politicians in the faculty, he intro
duced Snedden, 'US, the lirst
speaker
Mr. Snedden confined his re
marks largely to the fall of prices
and the injustice to thy debtor
classes brought about thereby. As
so much depends upon the borrow
ing and lending of money, it is ev
ident, he contended, that the dis
tress falls most heavily on the pro
ducing classes. ''This steady de
crease of prices can be met only by
increasing the currency. All the
evils we have suffered under appre
ciating currency will continue
under the gold standard." Me
closed his remarks by citing statis
tics to prove that the supply of gold
was insufficient for the needs of a
nioneta rv st a nda rd.
Ross, 'V) 7, was the first speaker
on the side of the yellow metal.
After indulging in a little sarcasm
at the expense of his opponents, he
spoke in substa nee as follows: "The
burden of proof rests with the other
side, as it always rests with the ad
vocates of a great change. Gold
has been the standard of all ages.
A change such as the affirmative
proposes is great, revolutionary,
and problematical as to its outcome.
The fall of prices is used as an ar
gument by single tax advocates,
greenback advocates, Socialists, ex
port bounty advocates, and every
revolutionary student of economic
questions" He closed by pointing
out the attitude of other tuitions
toward the free silver theories.
Morgan, '1)8, the second silver ad
vocate, spent most of his speecl\ in
refuting Mr. Ros>'s arguments and
in emphasizing the unfairness of a
standard which causes a continual
fall of prices. ''It is unfair to dis
criminate against the worker and
producer. Most of the captains of
industry are in the debtor class."
I le closed wit ha denial of t lie claim
that free silver was repudiation.
His remarks were frequently inter
rupted by applause.
Sheldon, 'iM>, took only half the
time allowed to him for his speech,
owing to a mistake in the signal

given for closing. He spoke in his
characteristically interesting and
i forcible way, confining himself to
picking to pieces his opponents'
j arguments, opposing statistics to
their statistics and quotingeminent
i authorities to show that panics and
business depression would result on
; free silver legislation.
