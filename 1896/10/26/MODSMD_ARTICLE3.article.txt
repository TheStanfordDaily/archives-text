Editor Daily Palo Alto: In
"view of the fact that the game with
the Berkeley freshmen is to be
played on Nov. 7, one week from
I next Saturday, insteid of Nov. 14.
las scheduled, our freshmen should
I at once begin practice as a team or
be willing to throw awn v a most
excellent opportunity to win a
victory for Stanford.
A game with the University of
the Pacific will be played on our
campus Thursday or Friday of this
week, and, if possible, one wit h Bel
mont next week. Will not every
freshman football player be on the
grounds ready for practice every
day at 4 p.m. sharp and help Stan
ford to gain another victory.
