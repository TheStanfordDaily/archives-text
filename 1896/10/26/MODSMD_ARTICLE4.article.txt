# Election Returns Will Be Received in the Gym.
## 
### 
Arrangements have been made
to receive election returns, via the
Western Union, in the gymnasium
election night and the day follow
ing. A wire will be run to the
gymnasium and direct connections
established. A stereopticon will be
provided and the returns thrown
upon a screen, the intervals being
occupied with a series of views of
choice California scenery. A por
tion of the building will probably
be reserved for the young ladies of
Ro.de and the faculty and their
wives.
The returns are received under
the management of the student
body, and a charge of twenty-five
cents for admission will be made.
