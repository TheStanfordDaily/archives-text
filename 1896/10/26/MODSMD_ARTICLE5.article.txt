Dikij.—Of typhoid fever, at her
residence in Salvatierra row, at
5 a.m. Oct. '24, Mrs. .Jennie Frye
Griggs.
The funeral services over Mrs.
j Griggs Sunday afternoon were
i simple. There was a short service
at the residence, and then the pro
cession moved to "God's acre" in
the arboretum, where Rev. Mr.
| l'eet of All Saints' Church read
the impressive Episcopal burial
service. Dr. Little and Miss Little
sang ''Nearer my God to Thee."
There was a large attendance of
students, faculty, and friends.
Mrs. Jennie Frye Griggs was
! born Oct. 17, 18(i8, in Indianapolis;
where her girlhood was spent.
After leaving the high school she
passed the Harvard examinations
with high grade and took advanced
standing in the Indiana State Uni
versity at JMoomington, where she
I graduated in '88. Her specialty
was languages; she knew Latin,
| French, and German thoroughly,
\ and was able to use 1 taliau, Spanish,
[ Anglo-Saxon, Gothic, and Old
! French. While in college she met
Mr. Griggs, to whom she was
! married almost immediately after
his graduation in '89. Lecture en
gagements i n the East gave them
Ian extended wedding trip, taking
them into Massachusetts and the
Two quiet years at
Indiana University followed, dur
ing which their oldest child May
i was born. The following sum
mer there was another lecture en
! gagement in the Adirondacks, and
the year following was to have been
I spent in Harvard; but after their
| arrival in Cambridge their plans
were suddenly changed by a tele
graphic call to Stanford. The
! three following years were spent al
ternately at Stanford, liloomington,
! and Stanford. At the latter place
in Jan., 1895, their second child
! Edward was born. In '94 and '9")
j Mr. Griggs had leave of absence
; for an extended stay in Europe,
i where lie was joined by bis wife for
a few months of continental travel,
i It was characteristic of Mrs. Griggs
that she started to join him in
i midwinter, and took the journey of
nine thousand miles to Berlin
; alone. They spent the time in
j Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and
France, and it was one of the hap
piest times in their mutual life.
Mrs. Griggs' tastes were decidedly
literary and artistic., and she was
'passionately fond of music. An
j omnivorous reader, she knew the
field of fiction thoroughly, and was
| well acquainted, either in transla
: lions or originals, with the classic
literature of every country in
: Europe. Her intellectual ability
: was of a high order, being remark
lablv keen and sensitive. Her let-
I ters and her more intimate conver
sation revealed the keenest sense of
j humor and pathos; moreover she
j had a remarkably practical sense
; which made her manage her house
{and children with consummate
;skin.
Her character was reserved, but
'capable of the deepest devotion,
i which she lavished upon her hus
band and children. She had great
courage, steadiness, and indepen

deuce. She lias always been most
closely associated with Mr. Griggs'
work. He hardly made out a
printed abstract or laid out a col
lege course without her advice and
assistance. .She helped him collect
hooks and material, with a most
marvellous instinct for what was
lit to the subject in hand. She was
not only the mother but the teacher
of her children. She had already
gone over the fields of Norse and
I (»reek mythology and some Ameri-
I can history with her little daugh
! ter. In*the face of all these facts,
I one hardly needs to add that her
! loss is irreparable, and her mem
| ory most deeply cherished.
