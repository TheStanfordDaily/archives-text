### 
The lecture by Mrs. Chapman
Catt in the chapel this afternoon
was very largely attended. Mrs.
Stanford was in the audience. Dr.
Jordan introduced the advocate of
equal suffrage, and in doing so
spoke favorably of the movement.
.Mrs. Catt said: Each century has
brought some improvement toman
kind. Woman's rights began in
the fourth century when all of the
most learned men of ihe age met in
a church council to consider
whether women had souls and if
they could go to heaven. By a
small majority it was decided that
the)' had souls.
In the first council it was de
cided that a woman was a human
being and not a gate to hell. In
I the second it was recognized that
she had a brain. Then came a
long, gradual rise of mankind in
: general. The eigthteenth century
was the century for the rise of men.
At its beginning there were still re
strictions on religious worship, free
speech, and only a limited suffrage.
At the end of the century agita
tion began for manhood suffrage.
The rich, who alone could vote, at
once raised the cry, '"When the
poor man votes we will he robbed. '
Later they asserted that they didn't
know enough, and as a final ex
cuse they said. "The poor man does
not want it." Indeed it seemed
that he did not care about it, for
very few appeared to be desirous of
voting.
Women being "three paces be
hind'' have their turn in this cen
tury. At the beginning of the
(nineteenth century women could
not sing nor speak in church. They
could not go to public schools or
, universities. They could not even
sit with their husbands in church.
Now the church would he crippled
without woman. Almost all occu
pations are open to her. Women
are in every way capable of having
the suffrage.
Woman's suffrage has stood a
test of twenty-seven years in Wy
oming, and it is a success. The
women there are just as good
mothers as before, just as relined
and pure as they were before, and
besides that they have greater ex
perience and talent in politics and
business affairs. The politician in
Wyoming has to reckon on the
woman vote and consequently no
party can carry the election uuless
it has honorable men as candidates.
It, this way the politics of the State
of Wyoming have become purer
than elsewhere.
