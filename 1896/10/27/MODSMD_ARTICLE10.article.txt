and will jiive a concert in the
(•Impel on the evening of Nov. 18

commit lee on music.
An opportunity to hear this
famous performer will he appreci
ated hy all music lovers, and it is
expected that her appearance here
will he attended with the same en
thusiasm which greets her tours
through the East and Europe.
The Chicago Times has this to
say: ''Fannie Bloomfield Zeisler
was the pianist. She gave a won
derful performance of the concerto.
Her playing was forceful in the ex
treme and the clearness of touch in
the declamatory phrases showed a
marvelous command of the instru
ment. Chicago has, in the person
of Mrs. Zeisler, one of the greatest
living pianists. Her playing is full
of tire and passion, and her tech
nique is complete. The enthusiastic!
applause which fairly overwhelmed
j her at the close of the concerto
showed the appreciation of the
I audience and was a gratifying
mark of intelligence. She was re
called again and again, and finally
went to the piano and played Tau
: sig's transcription of Schubert's
military march as it has never been
heard here before. She did not
spoil it, as most players have done,
bv taking the tempo too fast, and
her wonderful command of the in
strument was ably shown in the
variety of tone color, Chicago may
I safely claim that Miss Zeisler is
t he greatest lady pianist of the day."
