President Cleveland, in his ad
dress, touched upon the mission of

1 lie college man in politics, closing
is follows: ''1 hasten to concede
I lie good already accomplished by
>ur educated men in purifying and
■steadying political sentiment; hut
I hope I may he allowed to inti
mate my belief that their work in
these directions would he easier and
more useful if it were less spas
modic and occasional. The dispo
sition nf our people is such that
while they may he inclined to dis
trust those who only on rare occa
sions come among them from an ex
t'lusiveness savoring of assumed su
periority, they readily listen to those
who exhibit a real fellowship and
a friendly and habitual interest in
all that concerns the common wel
fare. Such a condition of intimacy
would, I believe, not only improve
the general political atmosphere,
hut would vastly increase the in
fluence of our universities and col
leges in their efforts to pre
vent popular delusions, or correct
them before they reach an acute or
dangerous sta^e.
''1 am certain, therefore, that a
constant and active participation in
political affairs on the part of our
men of education would be of the
greatest possible value to the
country.
'"It is exceedingly unfortunate
that politics should be regarded in
any quarter as an unclean thing, to
be avoided by those claiming to be
educated or respectable. It would
lie strange, indeed, if anything re
lated to the administration of our
government or the welfare of our
nation should be essentially de
grading. 1 believe it is not a super
stitions sentiment that leads to the
conviction that God has watched
over our national life from its be
ginning. Who will say that the
things worthy of God's regard and
fostering care are unworthy of the
touch of the wisest and best of
men ?
'"1 would have those senr out by
our universities and colleges not
only the counselors of their fellow
countrymen, but the tribunes of the
people—fully appreciating every
condition that presses upon their
daily life, sympathetic in every un
toward situation, quick and earnest
in every effort to advance their
happiness and welfare, and prompt
and sturdy in the defense of all
their rights."
