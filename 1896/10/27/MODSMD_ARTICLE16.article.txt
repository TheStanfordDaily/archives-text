This is ajk>ut the dullest time 'of
the year in Stanford social life, .but
there is no reason why it should be j
so. The precedent of dormitory 1
entertainments so pleasantly in
augurated last year should not be
forgotten. There is no excuse fori
the wide social gap between the |
men and women of Stanford, and'
surely there can be no better way
to obviate this apparent estrange
ment than a meeting of lioble and
Encina at a reception given by one j
of them. The dinner and enter
tainment at Encina was so success
ful last year that a suggestion of
repeating it is not, we think, out of J
order.
