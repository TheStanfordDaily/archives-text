Editor Daily Palo Alto: As j
one outside both of the Students'j
Guild and the editoria I stuff of the'
Daily Palo Alto, I beg leave to
enter the controversy concerning
the hiring of a nurse hy the Stu
dent's Guild here. It seems to nit*
that the employment of such a
person hy the (Juild would he foolish
and unnecessary. There are al
ways plenty of good nurses avail-i
aide in San Francisco;- one can
generally he brought down here by
telegraph in about two or three
hours, time enough to attend to al
most any case which may arise.
Again, the services of the nurse
might he entirely useless some four
or five months of the year, and all
that time the Guild would have to
be paying the twenty or twenty-live
dollars a week required by a good
nurse. And in case of an epidemic,
how could one nurse attend to the
cases of four or five persons situated
at different places on the campus
or the surrounding country?
The thing needed, in my estima
tion, is a hospital or infirmary on
the campus, where all persons
seriously ill might be taken for
treatment, and where they might
have the necessary quiet and the
required sanitary arrangements,
and where three or four cases might
be attended to at once. Such an
arrangement need not be beyond
the present means of the Guild.
Some of our fraternities occupy
buildings which capitalists have
erected for them on expected re
turns from the investment through
: t lie rent pa id. Can not the (Juild
make some such arrangement?
There is surely enough money in the
(Juild treasury to pay rent on such
a building, and it might be fitted
out at little additional cost.
Obskuvkk.
