# STUDENTS IN ELECTION BOOTHS
## A 						New Departure. 
### 
There is to be a new feature in
troduced in the count of ballots in
Sun Francisco on election night.
It is no more nor less than a move
ment, headed by the Republican
State Central Committee of Cal
ifornia, for purity in politics and
for an impartial supervision of the
election returns. The committee
has raised four thousand dollars
with which to meet the expenses of
this movement, and has selected
.Mr. Powers, a prominent attorney
of San Francisco, to assume control
of all arrangements. It was Mr.
Powers' desire to place the system
of supervision on a purely military
basis, and to secure college students
to constitute the army of watchers.
Accordingly he has secured the ser
vices of an equal number of stu
dents'froni the University of Cal
ifornia and from Stanford to act as
clerks and aids on the night of the
election. The students will he di
vided up into squads of about
twenty caeli, each under the com
mand of a captain, who also has
three corporals under him who act
as aids. Each captain has charge
of a district. One private is sta
tioned in each of the different pre
cinct booths throughout the dis
trict to keep a close account of the
counting hi the ballots, to see that
there are no dishonest practices,
and to report the situation to a
corporal, who makes the rounds of
the booths every half hour. The
corporal reports at once to the cap
tain, the captain to the colonel,
and so on until it reaches head
quarters.
It is expected that this arrange
ment will have a great deal to do
towards having a fair count on
next Tuesday night. Each "soldier''
i- paid for his services and is re
quired to sign a contract to perform
acceptably certain duties. Prob
ably one hundred and lifty students
from Stanford, including seven
captains and twenty-one corporals,
will enter the army.
