Stanford University has one
privilege which she does not appre
ciate, and that is her Choral Society.
We are one of the few Universities
that can boast of such an organi
zation, and we ought to take a pride
in this fact. It. is generally to be
supposed that cultured people care
for good music; and to have good
opportunities right in our midst of
cultivating an appreciation of the
art, and not to take advantage of
them must of course reflect back
upon ourselves. Last year the
society was a large one, and
flourished remarkably under the
management of its efficient leader.
This year it is small and dis
couraged and the outlook fora con
cert as successful as the one of hist
year is not in most respects promis
ing. The members are not regular
in attendance and if they permit
themselves such liberties it. is not
remarkable that the membership is
small and the leader disheartened.
Change for the better is necessary
or success will never follow.
