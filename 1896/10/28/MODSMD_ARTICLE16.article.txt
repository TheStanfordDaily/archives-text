"Football, as played in this
country, is nothing but a brutal
sport, presumably legitimatized
and permitted to satiate the blood
desire that still exists in the breasts
of nine out of ten of our fellow
creatures today Ungainly and un
tutored louts, whose nerve centers
are so deadened that they become
absolutely insensible to pain, swell
the ranks of the players. They
would scarcely be permitted within
the walls of a college were it. not
for their brute strength. If the
sport is to continue there should be
;i weight limit to the men, thus in
suring n more even game, less dan
ger to the players, and more enjoy
ment to the spectators. A rhinoce
ros would have small difficulty in
charging through a herd of sheep,
but there would he little fun in
watching his movements. Were all
the men of even, or nearly even,
weight, there might be some chance

of a fair game. At present, the
team containing the heaviest ruf
fian is more than likely to prove
the winner."
