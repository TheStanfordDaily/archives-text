# On the Oval.
## 
### 
The seat of operations of t lie foot
ball S(|Uad was removed to the oval
yesterday on account of the heavy
condition of the gridiron
The practice as a whole was
rather unsatisfactory. Lou ting
seemed to he the order of the day.
The men were slow in lining up
and equally slow in getting into
the play after the ball wassnapped
There was little team work and the
interference as a rule consisted of a
solitary protector for the runner.
Dole made a fair run, cleverly
eluding several tacklers. B.
Thomas' work showed an element
which it has heretofore almost en
tirely lacked thatof running hack
with the ball. This was no doubt
due in a great part to the failure of
the line to properly protect him.
Daley broke through and stopped
many of the plays. .Jeffs and
Straight did some neat tackling.
One of Straight's tackles is particu
larly worthy of note. A runner
with very fair interference came
around his end and Straight was so
blocked that it seemed impossible
for him to reach the runner, but,
with a well calculated spring, he
leaped over the interfcrer's back
a lid downed his ma n.
Burnett, .lost, and Rice showed
Up best in following the ball. It
would be well if the players as a
whole would make an effort to more
fully develop thi> faculty. Daily
practice against the same team en
ables the players to learn the
signals of their opponents and too
often the men, when on the defen
sive. become accustomed to ''play
by signals" rather than to trust to
the quickness of their senses to de
termine where the ball is to go.
