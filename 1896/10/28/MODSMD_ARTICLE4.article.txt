been addressed to the Daily Palo
Alto concerning the stand taken
by the alumni in regard to (he re
cent action of the active members

from the fraternity of Phi Gamma
Delta:
Editor Daily Palo Alto. Sir:
The absent and early initiates of
the late local chapter of Phi Gamma
Delta wish to be understood as
fully commending the step recently
taken by the active members.
Prompted by our approval they de
cided to surrender the charter and
requested that they be expelled
from Phi Gamma Delta. The posi
tion we take is outlined in the fol
lowing statement signed b}' us and
sent to the annual convention of
the fraternity now in session in
Chicago:
/'o thr (General Convention <[112 I'hi
(iomma Delhi: We, the alumni
members of Lambda Sigma chap
ter, approve of the withdrawal of
that chapter from Phi Gamma
Delta. We endorse the resolutions
submitted by the active members.
Their objections to the course of
the general fraternity are our ob
jections. We sympathize with
them and believe that they are jus
t i lied in t heir act ion.
Entertaining such feelings we are
no longer loyal members of the fra
ternity. To remain in the frater
nity would manifestly be to occupy
an untenable position. We accord
ingly ask that we be expelled.
