# Tuesday Evening Lecture.

### 
Prof. James Wharton of Pasa
dena gave last night's lecture in the
chapel, on "The Grand Canyon of
the Colorado." The lecture was il
lustrated with lantern slides made
from photographs taken by Major
Powell during his great and daring
trip down the Colorado in 1869, as
well as those taken by Prof. Whar
ton on later expeditions.
Before presenting the views Prof.
Wharton made a few remarks to
the effect that one might travel the
world over—search in the old
country as well as in the new —and
nowhere find scenery so grand and
stupendous as in the Grand Canyon
of the Colorado.
