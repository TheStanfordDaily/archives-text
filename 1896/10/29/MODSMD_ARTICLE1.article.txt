# STANFORD 10, RELIANCE 0.
## A 						Practice Game on the Campus. 
### 
A fair-sized crowd witnessed the
practice game between Reliance and
Stanford on the home field yester
day. The game was rather one
sided, as the Varsity kept the hall
well in the athletic club lot during
almost the entire game.
The spectators seemed to take
very little interest in the game, as
there was very little yelling. This
may have been out of deference to
the visiting team, but it would
have been far better to ha ve mingled
the Stanford and Reliance yells
and to have cheered both sides im
partially.
Reliance kicked off at the begin
ning of the game and Stanford
captured the pigskin, but was un
able to make much headway and
the ball soon passed into the pos
session of the Oaklanders. Then
ensued a game of see-saw in the
vicinity of the Stanford 85-vard
line. This lasted for several min
utes, neither side gaining much
ground. Finally the Varsity car
ried the sphere across the center
and into close proximity to the Re
liance goal. There the athletic
club made a stand and regained
the ball. This operation was re
pealed several times, Stanford ios
ing, as on account of the
fumbling of the halfbacks; but at
last Soper was forced over fora
touchdown. Soper failed at goal,
making the score 4-0 in Stanford's
favor.
After this touchdown a number
of fresh men were substituted on
the Varsity, and within twenty
minutes Stanford's score was en
larged by forcing Arlitt to make a
safety and by another touchdown
made by Dole. Thus the score
stood 10-0 after about thirty-live
minutes' play.
The play during the entire game
was very slow. The men seemed
exceedingly deliberate in all their
movements. This was excusable to
a certain extent on account of the
very heavy condition of the grid
iron. The Reliance team showed
better formation in interference
than Stanford, but the mud rattier
retarded the men and allowed the
Varsity to break up the interference
before it could get well under way.
As for Stanford, it had no - effective
interference, the men seemed to
know where to run but invariably
failed to block the tacklers. The
Varsity line held out very satis
factorily against the strong line of
the athletic club.
The Reliance team was handi
capped throughout the entire game.
Walton and Carter, the regular
halfbacks, and Nahl, quarter, did
not play. Burnett, the Reliance
center, was early compelled to re
tire, and Daley, '00, took his place
in defensive play. Reliance had
further bad luck in that they were
compelled to play in the east goal,
which is much lower than the
center of the field, a fact which
would seemingly have little effect,
but which counts fora good deal on
a heavy field and against line plays.
Little Piatt did some very clever
defensive work for his side. He
was in every play, and often
''nailed" his man before he could
start. Oliver and Wells put up a

very fair game at guard. The men
showed rather poor physical con
dition, especially when they were
called upon to face a fresh team
after twenty minutes of play.
Stanford's hacks were very slow
in starling and showed decided
tendencies to give the plays away
and to fumhie the hall. Dole made
better gains than any other of the
hacks, although he too was slow in
starting. Both of the Varsity full
hacks proved very weak at line
hucking. They usually hit the line
in an upright position and seldom
found an opening. The punting
on hoth sides was poor except for
one of Murphy's returned punts.
C. Thomas made an excellent show
ing against his adversary, as did
Burnett,'oo, against his namesake
of '05. Jeffs played a strong end,
and Cotton hucked the line in a.
capital manner.

It is rumored that Nott, ex
captain and tackle of Brown Uni
versity eleven, now instructor and
football coach at Berkeley, is to
play tackle with the University of
California team against Stanford.
While it may he perfectly legiti
mate for Nott to play, it seems very
unfair and not tilie sport, and we
hone that the rumor is unfounded.
