# Sweaters Below Cost.
## 
### 
I am going to sell all my knit
goods way below cost. I want to
get rid of them and am not going
to handle them any more. Blis
ter's best grade, double neck, all
wool sweaters reduced from $8.50
to $1.90. Lighter weight, reduced
from $2.50 to $ 1.50. We have four
dozen today, and don't want a
sweater left by Saturday. Come
and see them and you can't resist
the temptation to buy.
