# They Want Their Own Control.

### 
A student body meeting lnis l>een
called at the request of fifteen
members of the musical clubs, in
order to take action in case the
Executive Committee of the Associ
ated Students refuses to ratify at
their meeting this evening the new
constitutions presented by the
musical men last Tuesday evening.
The Executive Committee made a
proposition Tuesday evening modi
fying their previous conditions,
which seemed to be perfectly satis
factory, but a number of musical
men wish to go out of student body
control, and the meeting of the stu
dent bod}' is called to settle that
old, old question.
The new constitutions of the
(ilee and the Mandolin Clubs are
alike except in name. The main
provisions and changes are as fol
lows:
Article 11, Sec. 1, provides that
a business manager is to be elected

who may or may not be a compe
tent musician. The officers are a
treasurer, leader, and business
manager, so that the treas
urer of the Associated Students no
longer acts as treasurer for the
club. The treasurer disburses
funds upon the joint recommenda
tion of the business manager and
leader; he is to present detailed re
ports of receipts and expenditures
to the executive committee of the
club, using the voucher system of
the U. S. government, in the same
manner as the tressurer of the stu
dent body; he is to keep his books
open to members of the club, and
his accounts will lie audited by the
executive committee of the club; he
shall provide bonds as required by
the executive committee.
Article VII, Sec. 1. Any act of
any officer may be repealed or
amended by a majority vote of the
members present at any meeting of
/lie club.
The by-laws reduce the annual
deposit from two dollars and fifty
cents to two dollars; tines for tardi
ness from twenty-five cents to lif
teen cents; lines for absence from
rehearsal from tii'ty cents to twenty
live cents; fines for absence from
concerts, etc. from five dollars to
two dollars and lifty cents; fines
for tardiness at concerts from two
dollars to one dollar.
The business manager arranges
preliminary matters in regard to
trips, etc., presents his plans to the
club's executive committee for
sanction, lie may not contract
debts exceeding five dollars without
the consent of the executive com
mittee of the club.
The executive committee consists
of the leader and two others. The
executive committee acts in the
general welfare of the club, "shall
select music and shall have full
power to select new members, to
expel those whom they do not deem
competent, and shall arrange all
programs."
The executive committee referred
to in the foregoing is the executive
committee of one of the clubs,
either Mandolin or Glee, as the case
may he, and not, the Executive
Committee of the Associated Stu
dents. The student body is to
have no control whatsoever, the
clubs being absolutely independ
ent. No provision is made in re
gard to assuming any part of the
debt incurred by the student body
on the southern trip of the (jilee
and Mandolin Clubs. No provis
ion is made as to the management
of the Thanksgiving evening enter
tainment, the contracts for which
have been signed by the treasurer
of the student body.
This is a very important propo
sition and a representative meeting
should be held to act upon it. The
whole affair resolves itself into the
proposition, Shall the musical clubs
go out from student body control?
