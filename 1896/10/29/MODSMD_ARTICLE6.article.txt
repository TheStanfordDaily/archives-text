Little has been done in the way
of enlisting material for the Oarnot
medal contest which is to he held
here within a few weeks. This
properly conies within the province
of the literary societies,and it is in
cumbent upon them to put forward
available contestants for this debate.
Last year we neglected the matter
entirely until almost the eleventh
hour, and then had much trouble
in securing the required number of
contestants to take places in the
debate. We appreciated our mis
take when the medal was awarded
to Berkeley. A repetition of that
indifference will invariably pro
duce the same result.
