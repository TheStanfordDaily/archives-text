The action of a few prejudiced
students in the student hody meet
ing this afternoon, while not such
as to merit unqualified condemna
tion, was yet much out of place. It
has always been supposed that if
there was one qualification above
all others which the possession of a
liberal education gives to a person,
it is the conviction that no man,
whatever his personal opinion or
inclination, should attempt to pre
vent or at lea*t hinder by jeers in
a public meeting the expression of
the opinion of another. The pro
ceedings in the chapel this after
noon hardly went to the extent of
boisterousness, but they came dan
gerously near the point several
times. Jeers and interruptions are
what one would naturally expect
in a political meeting or in "packed"
assemblages, but we hope that no
calm, deliberate meeting of the
Associated Students of Stanford
University will ever lay itself liable
to a reputation of that character.
