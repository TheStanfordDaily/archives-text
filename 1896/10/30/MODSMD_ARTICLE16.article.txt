# Chess Matters.

The Pomona College Chess Club
hap challenged the Stanford Chess
Cluh to plav another game simul
taneously with the one already in
progress, and it asks to have the
privilege of the lirst move. Our
club has agreed to play the game
under the proposed conditions. The
college club has opened with a
Queen's (-iambit, which has been
declined.
The lirst game has resolved into
a Ruy Lopez or Spanish Opening,
which is a very popular one among
the masters, and is considered by
all the authorities as one of the
strongest forms of attack on the
chess board at the disposal ot the
white forces, although -it is by no
means invincible when met by
proper play from the opponent's
side. So far, and from the aspect
of the game, there is no way of fore
telling the outcome.
