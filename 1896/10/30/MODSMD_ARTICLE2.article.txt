# Reliance Shows Up Stronger in the Second Practice Game.
## 
### 
Reliance and Stanford met again
yesterday in practice. The teams
played a much closer game than on
the preceding even ing, and a 11 hough
the pigskin was kept well in the
Reliance lot, it was only after thir
ty-live minutes of play that Stan
ford was enabled to score.
For some time after the kick-off
the bail was kept in Varsity terri
tory, but the athletic club men
were soon repulsed and put on the
defensive in the vicinity of their
own goal. Stanford threatened the
Reliance goal again and again, hut
partly through its own poor show
ing and partly through the stand
taken by its opponents thecardinal
could not score.
At one time the Varsity reached
the Reliance twenty-yard line and
the signal was given fora drop
kick hv Dole This failed because
of Murphy's pass. The touch-down
was made only when the Oakland
ers had hecoine winded and were
forced to face a team which had
been strengthened by the addition
of fresh backs. Cotton made the
touch-down and Murphy kicked
the goal. Score: Stanford 6, Reli
ance 0.
The most noticeable error made
by the Stanford men was the tend
ency to tackle high. It seemed im
possible for the line-men to tackle
low, and very often the backs and
ends were guilty of this fault. The
ends were also too apt to overrun
the catcher on a punt. Two other
weak points in Stanford's play are
the disposition of the line-men to
play too high, and the failure of
the players to use the straight arm
in running with the ball
For Reliance, little Piatt, the
champion feather-weight wrestler
of the Coast, again distinguished
himself. Mis playing was stronger
than on Wednesday. He ran with
the ha 11 in a ca pi la I manner, squi rul
ing through seemingly impassable
crowds and never giving up until
the whistle had blown. His ex
ample in persistence might be prof
itably followed by our backs, for
they are entirely too apt to'"die"
the instant they are tackled. In
defensive play he was equally
strong. Lanvon, Lacuima, and A.
Arlitt also did good defensive work.
Harry Walton made some neat
runs a round I he end.
Cotton made the longest g;,ii; for
Stanford when he "'sift'd through
the line," as "Bill'* Harrington
says, for thirty yards. Fisher
played a consistent game through
out. The same may he said of
Dole, who bucked the line verv
well. Harrington tackled and
bucked well, but would be surer, of
Ins distance if he would lower his
head when charging through the
line. Jeffs and Straight, except for
their faulty tackling on punts, did
splendidly both in aggressive and
defensive play. Williams and
Fickert played remarkably well
particularly in thenianner in which
thev covered the whole field on de
fensive work. Soiwr's nlavinir was

an eye-opener. Not only did he
punt well, but his tackling and
general work showed up very strong.
Parker's unfaniiliaritv with the sig
nals caused considerable confusion,
and at a critical point in the game
ruined a possible touch-down.

After this game the Freshman
team lined up against a picked
eleven, composed mostly of second
eleven men. The practice, begin
ning as a comedy, soon developed
into a very well contested game
which resulted in a score of (1-0 in
favor of the Freshmen. It was
most noteworthy for the fact that
it developed a light but speedy new
halfback in the person of Scoville,
'00.
