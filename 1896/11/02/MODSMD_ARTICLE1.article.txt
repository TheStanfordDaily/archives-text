# OUTPLAYED.
## Olympic Defeats Stanford by a Score of 4 to 0. 
### 
Two vastly different pictures were
presented within and without the
gates of Central Park on Saturday
On the outside thousands stood in
the sun and cheered for gold and
applauded the line showing made
by the participants in the parade,
while within the park a scant score
of loyal Stanford men, defying the
jeers and hisses of those not in
sympathy with them, yelled for the
cardinal and struggled to urge the
team on to victory, hut their efforts
were of no avail. The players were
insensible to everything; nothing
short of an earthquake could have
a roused them. ''They played like
a lot of Chinamen," as an old Stan
ford star put it.
The Olympians toyed with the
collegians. Stanford was outclassed
both in defensive and aggressive
play. Its much - talked-of line
seemed to lie composed of holes,
while the backs were of very little
use. 'I here was no team work, no
interference, and not even good in
dividual work. Olympic, on the
other hand, showed fair team work,
good interference, and splendid in
dividual play.
There have heen many and varied
excuses offered for the miserable
playing, the most credited of which
is that the men were overtrained.
That seems hardly possible, for the
men have not trained harder than
in previous years, and last week
there were but two days of real
practice. To the observer on the
side lines it appeared that the
men did not know how to pay
their positions to the best advan
tage nor did they form any inter
ference for the runner. As far as
theOlvnipic interference was con
cerned, it would have been an easy
matter to have broken that up,
had the Stanford backs understood
the art of getting through the line.
It is no diHieiilt matter fora man
to spoil a play provided he is quick
enough to get through the line be
fore the interference can be formed.
()11 Saturday theOlympic club men
were slow enough in forming their
interference to enable the slowest
man on the team to get through,
had he known the art.
When we compare Saturday's
game with the previous game with
Olympic, it would appear that
Olympic had improved immensely;
but that can hardly be possible
when we take into consideration
the fact that Olympic has trained
very little in the last few weeks and
two of its best men have been com
pelled to lay off. The only con
clusion left is that Stanford has
fallen off in its work, for the team,
with the exception of quarterback,
was virtually the same as on the
former occasion.
We shall reserve any criticism
of the players as individuals,
knowing that they are made of better
stuff and Imping that this shall
prove to have been simply an off
day.
Of the Olympic players, Stickney
proved himself to be the finest
player on the Held â€”his work was
great. Their Theirkauf showed up
finely, lie* plays a much better
game than last vear. Code showed

some excellent defensive work but
his passing was very erratic.
Sheehy proved himself a strong
man for his position both in de
fense and ground gaining.
At the beginning of play Murphy
kicked off thirty-five yards, Weldon
caught the ball and returned it
forty yards. Stanford's ball. The
Varsity failed to make the dis
tance on the first two downs and
Soper punted twenty-five yards.
Weldon nabbed the pigskin and
Harrington downed him. Then
Olympic shows the first signs of the
bucking ability which was eventu
ally to win them the day. The ball
changes hands several times in the
next few minutes. At last Soper is
compelled to punt. Olympic getsa
fair catch at the center of the field.
Stickney is given a free kick and
shows his fine punting ability and
good judgment by aiming the ball
so that it went in touch on Stan
ford's live-yard line, thus doing
away with the possibility of Stan
ford returning or running it in.
Stanford's ball. Cotton gained
live yards, |)ole, Kisher, and
Straight each two, and .Jeffs
fumbled to Sticknev. Then Stick
ney. A orse, and Weldon by short
bucks carried the ball to within a
yard of the goal, and on the next
try Stickney carried it through the
tackle fora touch-down, after fifteen
minutes of actual plav. Weldon
touched the ball before Stickney
could kick the goal, Stanford
charged and no goal was allowed.
Score: 4 to 0.
For the balance of the half the
ball was kept in Stanford territory,
rime called for half with ball
on Stanford's twenty-five-yard line.
In the early part of the Hist half
the ball changed hands several
times until Murphy punted thirty
yards into Weldon's hands. Then
began the poorest exhibition of de
fensive work ever witnessed on a
gridiron. Stanford seemed de
moralized, and Olympic, without
once losing the ball, carried it by
short end runs and line bucks an
aggregate of 102 yards and over the
line; but the touch-down was not
allowed. Although Stickney
crossed the line with the hall lie
was so badly injured he could not
call "down," and Cotton took the
ha 11 from him, thus making a touch
back. After this Stanford took
something of a brace, but it was too
late. The game had been lost.
