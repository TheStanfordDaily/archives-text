The result of the game with
Olympic last Saturday was a sur
prise to everyone, even the club
men themselves not expecting vie
tory. Although the announcement
of the score on the campus properly
caused some consternation and a
little adverse criticism, yet we
should not fall into the habit of
"croaking" at every little misfor
tune. It may have been best that
we were bea ten. There is no doubt,
as Captain Fickert says, that it
will lead us to hunt out our faults
and correct them. The fact, how
ever, that something is wrong
should be seriously considered.
Either the men are over-trained or
they are not playing football. The
loss of the game last Saturday will
surely entail an investigation which
may locate the defect. At any
rate let us not "croak."
