If the Associated Students are
going to relieve themselves of re
sponsibility for the financial man
agement of the musical organ
izations it must be done before
Thanksgiving. If the settlement
of the question is deferred until
that date, it will be too late for the
musicians to undertake the north
ern trip under their own manage
ment, because it was their plan to
give concerts in nearby cities and
thus raise funds for the initial ex
penses of the trip. After Thanks
giving the organizations will stand
as a unit in favor of the Associated
Students assuming the responsi
bility, the treasurer will also be
desirious of seeing them go as it
will afford him a very pleasant way
of spending the holidays, and the
Executive Committee will be less
exacting in its demands, for if the
trip he not taken, the blame will
belaid upon them. If any obli
gations are to be imposed on tin*
musical clubs tbey should be im
posed immediately, as otherwise
the clubs will be unable to dis
charge them for want of time.
