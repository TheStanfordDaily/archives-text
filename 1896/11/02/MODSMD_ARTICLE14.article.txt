# SUNDAY'S SERMON.
## "The Christ of Today. " 
### 
"1 am lie that liveth and was
dead," was Dr. E. R. 1 )ilie's theme
Sunday morning. This claim and
this alone, he said, can account for
Christianity's progress. The resur
rection is its central truth. Kenan
may say that Mary saw a patch of
moonlight and mistook it fora
risen Lord; hut tlie overthrow of
countless wrongs, the transfor
mation of myriads of lives, the
preenii nent progress of the Christian
nations, is not accounted for hy a
patch of moonlight As Carlyle
has said, Christianity lives he
cause the living Christ lives.
Christ touched the mainspring of
life, and as life's constant inspira
tion he lives throughout the
centuries. He came not to Pales
line as a statesman; hut it is lie
who hasalmost emancipated Europe
and who lias made the United
States what it is. lie came not as
an artist; hut Thorwaldsen, falling
in tears before his own statue of the
Christ, and Handel on his knees
composing the Messiah, have testi
fied to the living power of Christ in
art. Ile came not as a writer; hut
literature is full of him; he has
spoken through Milton and Tenny
son and Longfellow, and the
modern hooks that had the greatest
sale last year in England and
America were those stories that
were most thoroughly imhued with
the idea of Christ as a living factor
in men's lives He came not as a
philanthropist; hut the heart that
was broken on Calvary has lived
again and caused the erection of
hospitals and homes over two
continents, and his pierced hand
rested upon Lincoln's while he
wrote that great word "Liberty."
And yet perhaps the work of this
living Christ is but begun. As
men, loyal to the inspiration that
his living presence gives, shall con
tinue to study and work and live
for the uplifting of humanity, they
shall yet usher in an epoch upon
earth, when angels, looking down
upon a world of men made Christ
like by his living presence, may
wish that (iod had made them men.
