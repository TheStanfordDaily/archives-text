# Redwood City Concert.
## 
### 
The musical concert given by the
(ilee, Mandolin, and Banjo Clubs
in Redwood City Saturday was a
decided success. The occasion was
the grand Chrysanthemum Car
nival, which the citizens of that
place had been holding for the past
few days, and which the concert by
the Stanford clubs was to bring to
a close.
The hall in which the entertain
ment was given was a mass of
(lowers, the sides being banked with
the choicest chrysanthemums of all
shades and varieties. The clubs
drove up to the city in buses and
found a packed house, in which
standing room was at a premium,
awaiting them on their arrival.
The program as rendered met
with a very warm reception from
the audience. Each number was
enthusiastically applauded, and
the clubs bad to submit to repeated
recalls. All who were present at
the entertainment speak of the
work of the clubs in the most favor
aide terms. K. B. Riley, '00, made
his initial appearance on the clubs'
program, in a humorous reading.
His work made a decided hit and
he was obliged to respond to two
encores. His ability as a reciter
should make him a valuable addi
tion to the clubs.
Upon the conclusion of the en
tertainment a sale of the flowers
took place, after which a short in
formal dance was given. The clubs
returned to the University about
1 o'clock the next morning.
