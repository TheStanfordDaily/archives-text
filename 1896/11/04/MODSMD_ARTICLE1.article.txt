# BERKELEY VS. RELIANCE.
## An Exciting Victory for U.C. 
### 
One of the most interesting games j
seen on this Coast for many a day I
was the contest between Berkeley j
and Reliance on Election day. It was}
a quick, snappy game, abounding
in surprises and grandstand plays —
the kind of game that appeals tot
the spectator. At the end of the !
first half the blue and gold sup-1
porters were entirely squelched I
under a score of KM) for the ath
letic club, but the second half told j
a different story. Berkeley's team,
strengthened by the replacing of i
some "ex peri ment a ls" by recognized
candidates, made one of its charac
teristic sa I lies, and won out in an j
exciting finish by a score of 16-10.
At the outset Reliance adopted
litie-bucking tactics. Starting from
the kick-off they carried the ball
straight down the Held by succes
sive assaults on the line of the uni
versity team, which they seemed to
tear up at will. Avery at right tackle i
being the weakest point. Four i
times the university line was forced
back fora total distance of forty-1
five yards, losing the ball twice and,
scoring twice Carter and Walton,
both ex-Stanford men, did particu
larly well in this half.
In the second half Oastlehunj
went in at the weak right tackle,!
and Sherman replaced Whipple.
The Berkeley play took on that "do
and die" character which Ransome i
and Sherman seem always to put
in their teams. By end runs and
tackle plays the ball was twice
forced over the goal of the club
men. After the second touch-down
came the play of the game. Reli
ance kicked off well into the uni-i
versity territory. Hall caught the
ball, and under I he wonderful inter- j
ference of Sherman and Ransome |
went all the way down the field for
a touch-down. It was a wonderful
run, but the credit, as is usual in
such cases, belongs to the interfer
ers rather than to the runner. Re
liance "took a brace'' after this,'
and were rapidly getting over the
gridiron toward the University goal
when time was called.
The main points noticeable in
Berkeley's play were the weak
ness of her line and the great
individual and team work of her
backs. Ransome, Sherman, and
Hall are a trio of offensive players
hard to beat on the Coast. Ran
some's kicking, however, was not
so good as usual.
