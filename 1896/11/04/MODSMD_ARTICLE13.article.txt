Anyonio who has watched the
play of the University of California
team the past two seasons must
have been impressed by the deter
mination with which some of her
veteran players plunge into ;tn up
hill game. There is no discourage
ment such as is often apparent in
our ranks when the game is going
against us, there is none of that
fumbling on the opponents' very
line such as has too often marked
our play this year. Can we not
put a like spirit into our play?
