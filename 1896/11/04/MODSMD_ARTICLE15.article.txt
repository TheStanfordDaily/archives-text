It will probably never be known
just how much good was accom
plished by the presence of student
"watchers" at the polls in San
Francisco on Election night. All
who participated in the watch,
however, report that a straightfor
ward count of the ballots was had,
and inasmuch as the system has
intelligently demonstrated this, it
lias proved itself a success.
Great as is the need of honest re
turns of the election accounts, the
ence of university students in
the voting booths, in particular ca
pacity, means much more than

this. As the leader of the move
ment Siiid, it means the intro
duction of intelligence and brains
into the contest and the entrance
of education generally into politics.
It is the absence of this active re
spectable element in these matters
that accounts for the corruptibility
of our politics today, and those
who advocate the establishment of
this system have struck at the
mainspring of the evil.
College students have earned the
reputation, whether rightfully or
wrongfully, in the past, of being
just a little too much puffed up
with the idea of their own impor
tance and good clothes to lower
their dignity by mixing in the or
dinary affairs of the world, or put
ting themselves on a level with
"mere humanity."' It was the
opinion of people who incline to
that idea and of politicians in gen
eral that students as poll watchers
would he ineffective, that men who
understand the business of "fixing"
elections could easily hoodwink the
college "dude." The attempt last
night was more of less of an exper
iment designed to test the utility of
college men in practical politics,
and those who watched the attempt
believe the experiment succeeded.
The corruptionists on both sides
found that the stucents knew the
law and were ready to enforce it,
and above all that they were faith
ful to their trust. A comment
heard on the "Howery'" last night
was a sincere tribute from an op
ponent: "No chance ter lix dis
ward. Dose college dudes knows
dere by.' 1
