Editor Daily Palo Alto: The
university has been somewhat en
livened during the past week on ac
count of the approaching election,
yet no great enthusiasm has been
aroused. A straw ballot was taken
Friday which resulted in an over
whelming majority for McKinley.
The president has excused a num
ber of students that they may go
home to vole.
The announcement of the gener
ous gift of Mrs. Phoebe Hearst has
caused great enthusiasm amongst
the students this week. Resolu
tions of thanks were adopted by the
Associated Students at a meeting
held last Wednesday in the main
tent. The humor of the situation
was felt by the students, and the
fact that we shall not need to use
the terns permanently was hailed
with great joy
Two events during the past week
have served to impress upon Cali
fornia that the football season is
advancing. The first is that Lieu
tenant W inn has excused the foot
hall men from drill, and the second
that a committee has been ap
pointed to judge the new football
songs. The Associated Students of
fered a prize this year for the best
song, and a good collection is ex
pected.
There have been no developments
in the line of track athletics. The
executive committee does not man
age to collect money as rapidly as
it wishes. About one hundred dol
lars has heen raised this term by
subscriptions, but there are many
pressing needs. A project is on
foot to organize regular cross-coun
try runs. Nothing definite has
been accomplished toward that end,
however.
Military drill has now assumed
its regular round. It is enlivened
at the beginning of each year by
the advent of so many raw recruits.
These have now worn off most of
their greenness and the old com
panies have heen reorganized, so
that regular battalion drills can
now be carried on. The drill on
Nov. 12 will he in honor of Col.
R. Shafter, commandant of the De
partment of Ca lifomia.
Two new organizations have
sprung into existence during the
past two weeks the Political
Economy Club and the Press Club.
Weil, '5*7. is the executive of the
first named, and Whipple, 97, of
the second.
11 is hoped by the faculty and
students that arrangements may be
perfected bv which we may have
the honor of an address by Hon.
Thos. Reed some time during the
week. We are under such great
disadvantages here at Berkeley by
having no assembly hall that very
few speakers are invited inasmuch
as it is so easy to attend meetings
in San Francisco and Oakland. If
Mr. Reed conies lie will be given a
roval welcome. Bkkkklkyan.
