Josh is with us once again in an
other new dress. Quinan's covers
are, hv the way. a feature; the ex
quisitely humorous picture of little
.losh "in clover" between two fair

maidens of (he rival universities
hangs in many a college room. The
current issue is not so good as j
usual. Probably the editors are
saving up for Thanksgiving. The
full-page cartoon by Johnson is ex
cellent, however, as is Quinan's
drawing of Ransome.
Josh has now been running in its,
present form for two months, and
the general verdict seems to he that |
the intercollegiate venture is a suc
cess. Not only is the circulation]
in the colleges large, hut it is much 1
taken and read in S;in Francisco.
