# Some Football Don't.
## 
### 
From the new hook on football
by Walter Camp and Lorin Deland,
we clip a few of their many admo
nitions to players:
Don't fail to play a fast game.
Line up instantly after each down.
Your game is twice as effective if
there are no delays.
Don't slug. Scrapping is not
football; more than this, it pre
vents good playing.
Don't wait for the opposing run
ner in the line. Break through
and stop him before he reaches the
line.
Don't tackle above the waist or
below the knees, but always at the
hips. When about to tackle keep
your eyes on the runner's hips and
he can not so readily deceive you
in his movements.
Don't let any player whom you
tackle gain an inch afterward.
Never let him gain his length by
falling forward. Lift him off his
feet and throw him baek toward
his goal.
Don't be satisfied with a super
ficial knowledge of the rules.
Master everv detail.
