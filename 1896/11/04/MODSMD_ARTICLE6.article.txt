# Speaker Reed Visits the University.
## 
### 
The University was on tip-toe
with expectancy over the rumored
arrival of Hon. Thomas B. Reed
this morning. At 11:30 a crowd
surged into the chapel to Prof.
Powers' class in Economics 1. The
room was packed when Dr. .Jordan
entered amid outbreaks of political
good feeling and cries of "Speech,"
"Reed," etc. The President stated
that NI r. Reed was then visiting the
stock farm and would be on the
quad in a few minutes, but owing
to bodily fatigue would not speak.
After several humorous remarks he
called upon Prof. Powers to give
his opinion concerning the election.
In a few well-chosen words Prof.
Powers spoke of the good spirit of
! the campaign in which such mo
mentous issues were at stake. Dr.
Jordan then gave his opinion of
•the election and excused the class.
The honored visitor arrived at
the main entrance a few minutes
later and was greeted with an en
thusiast it; welcome. Alighting from
! the bus he spoke somewhat as fol
; lows:
"This scene reminds me of my
I own college days. Our college life
j is our happiest, freest life, and amid
all its pleasures we should not for-
I get that we ourselves are responsible
| for what we learn. Our professors
! may guide, but we must do th'e
! rest. There is a difference between
: learning and wisdom. Wisdom is
! digested learning, and is of the
greatest importance towards a suc
cessful career. We should live to
grow wise, and our college life is to
teach us how to gain this wisdom.
"1 am much delighted by my visit
jto your beautiful University, and
j earnestly hope it may not he my
last."
i Amidst the hearty applause of
the assembled students the bus
; drove away with the Stanford veil
ringing in the ears of its occupants.
