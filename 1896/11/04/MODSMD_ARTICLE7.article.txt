# Election Returns at the Gym.
## 
### 
A large number of the students
| and faculty were at Encina gym
j nasi urn la√üt evening where the As
sociated Press dispatches via the
| Western Union were received over
| a special- wire. The first news
j came at 5 o'clock. The most im
i portant dispatches were thrown on
j a screen by means of a stereopti-
Icon. The intervals between were
! filled with views taken along the
i route of the Canadian Pacific.
One feature of the evening was a
straw ballot on the presidential
nominees and the sixth amendment,
j The count revealed a preference for
McKinley. The faculty with few
i exceptions voted for woman suf
frage, while a majority of the
! women were against it.
Notwithstanding the large num
ber of students who were employed
in the city, the affair was a finan
cial success. The crowd did not
begin to come much before 8 o'clock,
and remained until 12. Toward
the last it was rather tiresome on
! account of the slowness with which
the telegrams came in, caused prob
ably by the new balloting systems
|in the elections in the eastern
states.
