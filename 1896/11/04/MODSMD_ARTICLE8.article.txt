# Student-Watching a Success.
## 
### 
The experiment of using students
i as election watchers was tried in
the city election night, and proved

a success. For several weeks or
ganization of the force used last
night has been quietly going on.
About five hundred men were em
ployed in all. One hundred and
seventy-five of these were Stanford
men, the remainder were from
Berkeley or from U. C.'s affiliated
colleges.
As stated before there was a reg
ular military organization. A cap
tain commanded a squad cover
ing one assembly district; there
were nine such captains on the
Stanford force. There was a pri
vate in each booth, while corporals
under the direct command of the
captain visited each booth every
half hour. The orders were to stop
cheating and attempts at cheating
at any hazard whatsoever.
Contrary to expectation there
was little or no attempt at foul
practices. The regular ''ward
heelers" did not know how to take
the students; they were a new
species. In several booths an at
tempt was made to test the watch
ers; a common dodge was that <>112
sending ;i plausible looking per
sonage around to the watcher un
der the pretext of releasing him
for lunch. The students had in
structions on this point, however,
and the ruse invariably failed.
In many cases watchers were re
fused access to the polls and a po
lice call was necessary before they
were admitted.
There seems to have been only
two or three cases of deliberate and
persistent efforts to cheat. In one
such precinct the student watcher
and his corporal were handed very
roughly by the "heelers." The
protection of some fighters kept on
hand by the management for such
a contingency was necessary before
the students had a fair show in this
booth. In the two or three other
places where there was trouble a
call upon the police prevented all
underhand work.
