# Baseball Tomorrow.
## 
### 
It is announced that the strong
Tufts-Lyons team of Los Angeles,
winners of the Coast championship
in the Examiner hoy's baseball
tournament, will plav the Stanford
hasehall team tomorrow on the
campus. The Tufts- Lyons team
has proved itself a baseball aggre
gation of no small ability, having
beaten eighteen (dubs running on
the way to the baseball champion
ship. Harvey, their pitcher, is
spoken of as a bright particular
star. The members of the club are
supposed to be under eighteen
years of age, but most of them are
men in size and build, and our
nine need expect no boy's combina
tion. Our own chances are, of
course, slim, as there has not been
a baseball thrown on the Stanford
diamond this fall. The game will
afford some practice, however, and
the reception we give the Los
Angeles boys will certainly have
an effect in the South.
I'robable positions are as follows:
ST A N FOR I >. Tl' KTS— lAONS.
