Thanksgiving day is too far off
and we have too many good players
to justify any prediction as to
what our line-up may be. Con
sequently a candidate who drops
out now fearing that he has not
'"made the Varsity" is likely to be
throwing away his chances of suc
cess. There should be no giving up
at this stage of the game; no man
on the Varsity will be given his
place until he has bested nil his
opponents for the position.
