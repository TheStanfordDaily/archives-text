In its proposal to give sweaters
to the men of the second eleven the
Executive Committee has taken a
step which will meet with general
approval. A similar proposition
was made last year but came to
nought owing to lack of funds; this
season, however, our finances are in
a much better condition and, with
the receipts from the Thanksgiving
game, it is believed that the man
agement will be warranted in
making this expenditure. The
service that the second men ren
der is such that no one will begrudge
the small amount that is expended
in their behalf.
