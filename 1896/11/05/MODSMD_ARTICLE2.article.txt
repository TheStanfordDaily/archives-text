# Freshmen vs. Varsity.
## 
### 
The Freshman team lined up
against the Varsity last night in
{(reparation for the intercollegiate
Freshman game on Saturday. The
play was fairly spirited and, dur
ing the early part of the practice,
the Freshmen easily outplayed their
veteran opponents. The hacks of
the '00 team outclassed the Varsity
hacks in (juick starting, and by
this means, together with their gen
eral snappy play, they were able t<>
carry the ball within six yards of a
touch-down. The Varsity then
forced the ball back, and had every
thing pretty much its own way for
the remainder of the practice.

The older team was handicapped
considerably by the fact that the
Freshmen knew their signals, but
this very fact, together with the
Freshies' questionable practice of
playing by the signals instead of
developing the faculty of following
the ball, gave Fisher an oppor
tunity to make a touch-down.
Fisher played a very strong game
throughout; he is proving himself
one of our most valuable men be
hind the line. Cotton was put in
as fullback fora few minutes
toward the end of the game hut had

little opportunity to show his abil
ity in that position. Cotton is un
doubtedly the best line bucker we
have, for be gets up his speed very
quickly, bits the line hard and low,
and finds the openings well, so that
he may be expected to do some
good work in bis new position.
There are nearly two full teams
at the training table now and more
are being added as they prove their
ability.
