# Plan of the Yell Committee.
## 
### 
The Yell Committee has perfected
plans for organized applause at the
Thanksgiving game. The under
graduate veil leaders already ap
pointed are t«» direct the sections
while some alumnus, not yet ap
pointed. will have general charge.
In the meantime it is requested
that all who intend to yell at the
big ga me should beat the east end
of the grandstand at every football
practice. The yell leaders will be
there every evening, and an at
tempt. will be made t<> instill "'team
work" into our rooters.
