However sumptuous our environ
ment, there is always something
left to desire. With all the glories
of the quadrangle, in spite of the
hospitality of its arcades and
flower-beds, one thing was lacking
to the complete convenience of the
women students. This was a room
where those who do not live on the
campus could go between hours to
rest, or dry their shoes, or eat their
lunches, or otherwise make them
selves comfortable.
A few weeks ago at a meeting of
the University Club this need was
discussed and a project was put on
foot to remedy it. The committee
appointed to take charge of the
j matter were met at once by the ob
vious difficulty that in our general
crowded condition there was not a
corner left available for the pur
pose. This obstacle was removed
through the generosity of the Uni-
versity architect, who offered, rent
free, one of the rooms in the build
ing near the Co-op. in which his
office is situated.
This room has been cleaned and
painted and the proper furniture is
Ito be put in. The expense of put
ting it in order, of buying coal, and
of hiring a janitor is to be shared
among the faculty women and the
women students. Divided among
so many it need not fall heavily
on any one. Contributions of from
ten to fifty cents are expected and
larger sums will not be refused.
Mrs. Wight has been asked to act
as treasurer and general manager
in matters relating to the care and
expenditures of the room.
Following are the names of those
appointed to receive contributions:
In Palo Alto, Mrs. Gilbert, Miss
Blanche Boring; in College Terrace,
Mrs. Miller, the Misses Adams; in
Roble Hall, Mrs. Clements, Miss
Stoltenberg; on the campus, Mrs.
Wight. Contributions may also be
left at the Registrar's office. The
ladies of the faculty would do
well to bring their purses to the
club meeting to be held at Mrs.
Guido Marx's next Monday, as
contributions are in order on that
occasion and will be received by
Mrs. Marx, Mrs. Gilbert, or Mrs.
Branner. It is desired to pay the
bills at once, and accordingly
a prompt and general response
will be appreciated by those in
charge.
The room thus put at the dis
-1 posal ttf the women of the Univer
sity will be open to them, one and
all, from 8:30 through the entire
day. It should become a pleasant
resting place and lunch-room for
those who do not go home at half-
past twelve, and it should also
prove a convenience to any who
wish to spend both afternoons and
{evening at the quadrangle. Bar
ring accidents, it will be ready for
use in a week or ten days, and
notice to that effect will be given in
the Daily Palo Alto and on the
bulletin board. Contributed.
