However sumptuous our environ
ment, there Js always something
left to desire. With all the glories
]of the quadrangle, in spite of the
j hospitality of its arcades and
flower-1 teds, one thing was lacking
i to the complete convenience of the
i women students. This was a room
j where those who do not live on the
; campus could go between hours to
rest, or dry their shoes, or eat their
lunches, or otherwise make them
' selves comfortable.
A few weeks ago at a meeting of
the University Club this need was
I discussed and a project was put on
foot to remedy it. The committee
appointed to take charge of the
j matter were met at once by the ob
vious difficulty that in our general
crowded condition there was not a
corner left available for the pur
pose. This obstacle was removed
j through the generosity of the Uni-
I versity architect, who offered, rent
free, one of the rooms in the build
-1 ing near the Co-op. in which his
| office is situated.
; This room has been cleaned and
{painted and the proper furniture is
Ito be put in. The expense of put
! tin<f it in order, of buying coal, and
lof hiring a janitor is to be shared
| among the faculty women and the
women students. Divided among
so many it need not fall heavily
jon any one. Contributions of from
I ten to fifty cents are expected and
larger sums will not be refused.
Mrs. Wight has Iteen asked to act
jas treasurer and general manager
lin matters relating to the care and
expenditures of the room.
Following are the names of those
{appointed to receive contributions:
In Palo Alto, Mrs. Gilbert, Miss
! Blanche Boring; in College Terrace,
i Mrs. Miller, the Misses Adams; in
Uoble Hall, Mrs. Clements, Miss
| Stoltenberg: on the campus, Mrs.
; Wight. Contributions may also be
; left at the Registrar's office. The
ladies of the faculty would do
well to bring their purses to the
I club meeting to be held at Mrs.
Guido Marx's next Monday, as
contributions are in order on that
I occasion and will be received by
.Mrs. Marx, Mrs. Gilbert, or Mrs.
I Branner. It is desired to pay the
j hills at once, and accordingly
a prompt and general response
will be appreciated by those in
i cliarge.
The room thus put at the dis
-1 posal ttf the women of the Univer
sity will be open to them, one and
, all, from 8:30 through the entire
i day. It should become a pleasant
resting place and lunch-room for
those who do not go home at half-
I past twelve, and it should also
prove a convenience to any who
wish to spend both afternoons and
{evening at the quadrangle. Bar
; ring accidents, it will be ready for
j use in a week or ten days, and
! notice to that effect will be given in
! the Daily Palo Alto and on the
i bulletin board. Contributed.
