# Berkeley Letter.

### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto: The
center of interest for the university
people this week has been away
from Berkeley. Interest in the politi
cal campaign and in the football
in San Francisco, indeed,
has so engrossed the students dur

ing the past few days that there
lia\e heen very few happenings
worthy of note in the college life.
The first hop of the season will
be the "Freshie (ilee" which is to
be held in the gymnasium next
Friday night. The number of
freshmen is large this year and as
the gymnasium is small it has
been found impracticable to invite
more than a very small number of
the juniors.
A university cotillion will be
given in the gymnasium Nov. 20,
and it promises to be a great social
success. The Junior Promenade
and the Sophomore Hop are to
come off shortly after the cotillion.
Arrangements have just about
been completed by which the Glee
Club shall go to lleno, Nevada on
the day following Thanksgiving.
F. P. Taylor. '!>?, an ex-member of
the (ilee Club, is now coaching the
football team at the University of
Nevada, and it is through his
efforts that the club will be en
abled 10 take the trip. The holiday
tour of the (llee Club will be in
Southern Cmlifornia.
Last year a telegraphic target
contest was held between the bat
tallions of Cornell, the University
of Illinois, and University of Cal
ifornia. It proved to be very suc
cessful, and at the suggestion of the
commandant at Illinois it is pro
posed to widen the Held to all state
universities. If this is done it will
be almost correct to say that a new
form of intercollegiate sport has
been added to the list. The direct
object of the contest is, of course, to
lend added interest to the some
what wearisome target practice.
The contest is between teams of ten
composed of those making the high
est scores in their battallions. The
shoot takes place on the same day
in the different institutions, and is
under the supervision of some dis
interested person who telegraphs
the report to the army officer in
charge. Photographs of the targets
ustd are interchanged, and so con
siderable interest is aroused. Tar
get practice has now commenced
for juniors, and considerable inter
est is being shown. California was
victorious hist year, and naturally
is very anxious to retain her pres
tige.
The rousing game of football
which was held between our team
and the Reliance Club has added a
little more enthusiasm to the foot
ball partisans. A call has been
issued for every man who can to
turn out to help in the yelling at
practice games. The band will
probably turn out soon, too, and
interest will begin to increase as
the great Thanksgiving struggle
draws near. Berkklkyan.
