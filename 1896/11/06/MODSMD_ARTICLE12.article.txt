I x these days a man who expects
to take an active part in the affairs
of the world finds it almost abso
lutely necessary to he a hit* to think
on his feet and to give utterance to
his thoughts extemporaneously.

the future. I'lie man who comes

readiness of speech should join one
of our societies early in his course,
attend its meetings regularly, and
do the work faithfully which i> as
signed to hitn.
