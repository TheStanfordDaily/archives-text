# Some Football Don't.
## 
### 
From the new book on football
by Walter Camp and Lorin Deland,
we clip a few more of their many
admonitions to players:
Don't fail to try to take the ball
away from an opponent when he is
taekled. .Make a, feature of this
and you will succeed oftener than
you anticipate.
Don't let any thought take pre
cedence of the ball itself. Keep
your mind on the ball. Follow its
every motion to drop on it after any
fumble or misplay.
Don't let your opponent know
when or where you are hurt.
Don't in a ke excuses, however good
they may be. There is no room in
foot ba 11 for excuses.
Don't answer back to a coach
upon the Held, even if you know
him to be wrong. Do exactly what
lie tells you to do, so far as you are
able, and remember that strict obe
dience is the first requirement of a
pla ver.
Don't lose your temper. The
man who can not control his tem
per has no business on the football
field.
Don't be one minute late to prac
tice. The hour named is the hour
for vim to be on hand. If you
have not interest enough to be
prompt, resign from the game at
once, for von have not the proper
spirit for victory.
Don't let half the players of your
team be in their positions on any
line-up before you have taken
Don't forget the vital principle of
team plav, which can not be too
often impressed upon the mind. It
i- ibis: Team play begins the in
stant the center receives the ball
from the hands of the runner. In
other words, it is a part of team
play, and the most important part,
tn line up more quickly than your
opponents. This is the very truest
sort of team play, vet the delay of
one single man in taking his place
will ruin it completely.
Don't be an automaton. Thor
oughly master each principle and
then vary your play as eniergencie
a rise.
Don't let any man be ahead of
volt in dropping on the ball when
it is fumbled.
Don't fail to try to be in every
interference before it is finally
stopped. Follow each runner, and
watch fora chance to push him or
receive the ball from him when be
is tackled.
Don't play high if von are check
ing an interference «»r running as a
part of the interference. When you
drop out of an interference meet
voiir opponent as low as possible.
Don't fail to go down the field
under every kick.
Don't forget the rule that your
own runner must never be alone
when he is tack led.
Don't shirk any required study
or work for football. Earn the
right to plav football or don't at
tenipt it.
Don't he discouraged with your,
abilities or prowess. The right
spirit in football is worth more tban
anything, lie sure you have that
and your chances of success are
good.
Don't whine about decisions
which seem unfair. Accept only
honest, fearless officials, and then
leave the game in their hands.
Don't (hi anything to undermine
discipline, or you are putting the
ax at. I be very root of t lie tree.
Don't be careless about guard - ,
protectors, or padding over any
weak, injured, or exposed part of
the body. One negligence may
cost von the season's playing.
