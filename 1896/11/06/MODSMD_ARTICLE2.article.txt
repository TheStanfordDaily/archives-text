# Signs of Improvement.
## 
### 
The football practice last night
showed unmistakable signs of im
provement, particularly in team
work. The men seemed to have
acquired, to a certain extent, that
unity of movement which is the
first sign of Varsity form. There
are still far too many raw spots in
the work of the Varsity. The tirst
and most deplorable fault is the
weakness of a few backs in running
interference. It is very discourag
ing to anyone interested in the wel
fare of the team to see a halfback,
whose chances of making the Var
sity are very good, resort to the foul
means of tackling an end around
the neck in order to protect the
runner, rather than trust to his
weight and speed to block off the
tackier. We have forfeited a great
many chances in the past by off
side play and fouling, and it is the
duty of every man on the field to
school himself in practice to play
ing clean football so that it slnill
become second nature to him to be
careful in that respect. Then,
when the excitement of the great
contest comes, he will not for<zei
himself.
The Varsity men still fail to get
into the plays as they should. It
was hoped that the game with
Olympic would teach them a les
son, but there is still that lagging
on the outskirts of the scrimmage
which did much to prevent our
gains with the athletic club team.
Time and again in that game a
Stanford man would make a good
gain onlv to be forced back, simply
because the men of his team failed
to follow him up and lend him sup
port.
It would seem out of place to
criticise a team for high tackling at
this late date, wire it not for the
fact that this fault is so glaringly
apparent. The line men in partic
ular almost invariably fail to
tackle a man below the waist, and
often the runner, if reached at all
by the line men, is treated to the
delightful sensation of having his
neck enfolded in the brawnv arms

of a weighty adversary in what is
known as a ''necktie tackle."' Mr.
Cross's capital tackle on Straight
last night should prove a lesson to
our heavy weights, and should show
them that extreme length of body
is not a hindrance to low tackling,
hut rather an aid.
The Freshman team lined up for
signal practice before the regular
work <>112 the evening and put up a
good front so far as brawn and
muscle are concerned; their inter
ference seemed capital in formation,
and if the line can hold tomorrow
long enough to get the interference
in motion, we can expect good re
sults. The team might have been
given longer and more thorough
training in the early days of the
season, but, as it stands, the men
are in fair condition, and have the
good wishes of all for their success
in their coming struggle.
Cotton's running at fullback on
the Varsity last night was splendid.
His unfamiliarity with the position
makes him somewhat slow in start
ing but he gets up his speed in a
capital manner and is good for line
gains.
Straight made a very pretty run
on a fumbled ball and was neatly
downed by Cross who appeared in
a suit and strengthened the second
team immensely, but showed his
lack nf training by his unsuccessful
quest for ozone after a few minutes
of hard play. Carle was out again
for the first time and also strength
ened the second team.
