# English Club Meets.

Prof. Lathrop opened the meeting
of the Knglish t'11sI» on Thursday
afternoon with a few remarks con
cerning the poet William Morris,
who was the subject of the literary
discussion for the hour.
Prof. Hudson spoke at length of
the poet's life and work. He s;iid
in hrief:
"William Morris had pre-em
inently the gift of story telling. In
this he is surpassed hy none in
English literature except his mas
ters, Chancer and Drvden. Hewas
a voluminous prose writer and
translator. His prose romances
have a peculiar charm of iheirown.
He was an artist as weli as a poet,
and a craftsman as well «s an art
critic. His varied and extensive
pursuits show the great energy of
the man. I first met the poet in
London at a socialist club, before
which he delivered a lectureon Ice
land. It Wiis one of the most artis
tic speeches I ever heard, though it
was delivered to an audience of
rough work i lignum, who could
scarcely have been called cultured.
I came to know him afterwards in
all his largeness of mind and his
H'sthetic tendencies, and I wondered
how to reconcile his character as a
poet with that ;is a socialist. There
are three points which I wish to

note in regard to his poetry in this
connection. First, he discarded a
vast bulk of materialistic ideas.
Secondly, he had a deep realization
of the tragic conditions under which
life is spent. Thirdly, he under
stood the impossibility of carrying
farther than the present and the
J actual his views expressed in
'Earthly Paradise.' "
Miss Hardv spoke on "The prose
writings of William Morris." After
citing several passages from the in
troduction to his Icelandic tales,
she read selections from "House of
j the OrHings," commenting on their
j musical effect.
Prof. Newcomer treated the sub
ject of "William Morris as a trans
! lator": ' His translations are a very
! small part of his work. The ab
i sence of criticism on his .Kneid and
j Odyssey makes the Held an open
'though a difficult one. He has suc
ceeded. 1 think, in producing the
effect made upon ;i person by the
: originals. He has faithfully repro
duced the art consciousness of
Virgil, but the dignity and grace
j of the Latin poet are not in his ren
jdering. This is largely due to his
1 selection of the heptameter meter.
I am inclined to praise it ms a met
rical translation. As to the Od
yssey he has the same rapidity of
style that is in the original, but the
slovenliness of his hexameter gives
it anything but the smooth How
that is so beautiful in the Greek."
