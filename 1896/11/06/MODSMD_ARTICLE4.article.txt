# Yale Voters.
## 
### 
The students of Yale have won a
decided victory in the matter of
their contested right to vote in New
Haven. For many years the Re
publicans have contended that a stu
dent,as such, acquired a residence,
while tlie Democrats held that in
no case did he do so unless his
parents lived in New Haven and
lie was entered in the college cata
logue as residing in New Haven.
As the Democrats have, until this
yea r, controlled the hoard of
selectmen, it was only when the
Republicans obtained a majority in
the hoard that students not resid
ing in New Haven have had the
right to vote.
