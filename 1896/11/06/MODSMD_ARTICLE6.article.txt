# TUFTS-LYONS vs. STANFORD.
## The 						Los Angeles Boys Down the Varsity in Baseball. 
### 
Contrary to all expectation the
baseball game this afternoon
proved close and fairly interesting,
albeit a trifle slow. The Los An
geles players were all young, while
the Stanford men were sadly out of
practice, and the knowing ones
based on these facts their predic
tions of a "20-10" score. Never
theless the final tally was 2-1 in
favor of Los Angeles.
Tufts-Lyons began the scoring,
landing a runner in the second in
ning. Stanford scored in the same
inning, and the Los Angeles men
came in once more in the sixth.
From that time on there was no
more scoring, though the younger
team filled the bases in the eighth,
but were prevented from scoring by
MeLaine's cool work.
Of the individual players Thomp
son and C. Strohn especially dis
tinguished themselves. Thompson
made one fine running throw from
right field, stopping the player at
the plate. C. Strohn proved him
self a cool catcher, particularly
good at throwing to bases. He will
prove a valuable acquisition to
next season's team.
Besides their pitcher, Harvev
Cummings at third base made the
best showing for the Los Angeles
team. His work in stopping hot
grounders was the best seen on our
diamond fora long time.
