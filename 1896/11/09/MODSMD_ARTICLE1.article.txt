# NITTY-NITS 14, NAUGHTY-NITS 4
## The 						Stanford Freshmen Defeat the U.C. Freshmen. 
### 
The Jin de siecle classes of Berke
ley and Stanford met in an excit
ing football match at Central Park,
San Francisco, on Saturday. The
game was not notable for any great
amount of team work or star play
ing, but, nevertheless, it was in
tensely interesting to the spectator
on account of the great amount of
kicking, and for the fact that it was
hotly contested throughout.
The Stanford Freshmen deserve
more than ordinary credit for their
victory from the fact that their op
ponents outweighed them and were
seemingly older men.
Each side had a number of lusty
lunged supporters in the grand
stand, and although the Berkeley
contingent rather outnumbered the
wearers of the cardinal, Stanford
held its own in the line of noise.
A p.easant feature of the cheering
was the combination of the Berke
ley and Stanford yells given be
tween the halves. There were a
few specimens of the genus "'fellow"
with more tough than gentleman in
their make-up, who persisted in
making themselves obnoxious at
one or two stages of the game by
indulging in jeers and hissing, but
otherwise the enthusiasm shown
was of a good healthy order.
The side-lines were kept clear of
all except reporters and artists, so
the on-iookers had an unobstructed
view of the entire lield.
Tho umpiring was of a decidedly
poor order. Stanford seemed to get
the worst of the deal in every in
stance. To the uninterested spec
tator it would appear that the of
ficials, if not really showing par
tiality, were at least ignorant of the
rules of the game.
At the commencement of play,
Anderson kicked-off a distance of
forty yards for Berkeley. Murphy
caught the ball and ran it in three
yards, then punted forty yards.
It. bounded along for ten yards and
was then captured by a Berkeley
man, who fumbled, but one of his
side partners downed the ball on
Berkeley's forty-five yard line.
After losing five yards on the suc
ceeding down, Whipple punted
seventeen yards Stanford's ball.
Daley then made a capital gain and
after a few exchanges of punts, and
some short gains, Stanford had the
ball on Berkeley's forty-three-yard
line. Then by short gains, princip
ally through the line, Stanford
rushed it, along fora touchdown,
Daley carrying the ball across the
line. Murphy missed the goal.
Score Stanford 4, Berkeley 0. The
play throughout the game is shown
by the accompanying chart. The
second and third touchdowns should
be credited to Lanagan and Ballan
tyne respectively.
Towards the end of the game,
Berkeley took a decided brace and
was able to make very material
gains through Stanford's line.
For the U. C. Freshmen, Ander
son, Whipple, and Masters played
the best game. Dalev, Lanagan,
Murphy and Ballantyne did star
work for Stanford.
