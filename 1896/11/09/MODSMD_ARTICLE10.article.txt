# SUNDAY'S SERMON.
## Personal Responsibility. 
### 
Sunday's services were conducted
after the ritual of the Episcopal
church l»y Rev. E. B. Spaulding of
San Francisco. He chose as his
theme, "Personal Responsibility."
The text of the sermon is found in
Judges v, 28. He said:
Every life should have a clear
appreciation of its own responsibil
ity. Its future will depend upon
the basis on which that responsibil
ity begins and ends. The world
does not take us according to our
own standards. The world is full
of selfishness, but there is a higher
standard in that book, lying so
often on our tables as an ornament,
so rarely studied except to criticise
or scoff at, which, nevertheless, has
stood the lest of ages —the Standard
which says, "Thou shalt love the
Lord thy God with ali thy heart,
and with ali thy soul, and with ali
thy mind, and with all thy strength;
and thy neighbor ;is thyself." The
words of IScripture found incarna
tion in Jesus Christ, who taught
that the responsibility of man's life
was the lives of others.
Glimpses of that responsibility
:ire found in the Old Testament.
Deborah sang of old: ''Curse ye
Meroz, said the angel of the Lord;
curse ye bitterly the inhabitants
thereof, because they came not to
the help of the Lord against the
mighty." This curse was the most
passionate, the most just indigna
tion ever felt in tlie breast of man.
He shirked responsibility but
shared in the spoils. There are
those in our own life who are to us
what Meroz was to Palestine; those
who stand by, observe the battle
with wretchedness and wickedness,
yet take no part. How few people
realize that their position ought to
l»e one of help and instruction; that
the business man's olhce should be
a place to teach honesty and up
rightness; and that society should
lift souls upwards. A positive in
jury to a community is doing noth
ing and thinking nothing. The in
ertia of Christian communities
means a low state of spiritual vi
tality. A tonic must be given to
overcome this inertia. "He that
hath the Son hath life and he that
hath not theSon hath not life. The
inaction of life may be due to fash
ionable education or to the shielding
of their children from the battle of
life by those giants who have con
quered it. Any tendency toward
action and exercise is to be en
couraged.
Weakness assumes the forms of
moral cowardice, false humility, or
idleness. Cowardice is a wretched
name of contempt. One wonflers
how many people are morally
brave. Physical courage is not
rare. Many men will tight a bat
tle but shrink from a sneer. The
world wants moral heroes. There
is enough moral heroism in the
world to cause a moral revolution
if it were awakened. One must,
have moral courage to be brave for
God. Idleness is found everywhere.
Talents which have been bestowed
are not used. Persons look on and
observe the deeds of others. What
we have accomplished matters lit
tle. It is how we fought the battle,
how we fought sin in ourselves,
how we assisted others in the strug
gle, that matters much.
