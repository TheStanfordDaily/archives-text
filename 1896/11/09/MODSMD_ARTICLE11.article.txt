Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Pear Sir: In reply to your in
(jiiirv I l>t'g to say that I have
finished the MSS. of the Thanks
giving plav and have forwarded
s.iitie to H. 1). Connick for im

mediate rehearsal. The piece is
entitled "The Macbeths of Berkeley,
or After the Ball" and is distinctly
a tragedy, being modelled closely
on the lines of "Macbeth," a play
by William Shakspere. The piece
calls for considerable dramatic
ability and careful dressing, both
of which,! am promised, it will re
ceive. The production will be in
the nature of a revival and should
be of interest to an intelligent
audience. The moral of the drama
is of the highest value, and will be
appreciated on Thanksgiving night.
It is hoped that Prof. Hudson can
be prevailed upon to lecture on
"The Mutilators of Shakspere" in
the near future. Bearing in mind
the vast amount of misinterpre
tation and original insertion suf
fered by my predecessor through
neglect to write explanatory pre
faces to his plays, 1 purpose to give
a critical analysis and appreciative
review of my work in an early issue
of the Sequoia. Respectfully,
Carolus Agek.
