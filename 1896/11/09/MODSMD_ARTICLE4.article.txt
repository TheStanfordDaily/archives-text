The Princeton Tigers won the
game with Harvard last Saturday
in Boston by a score of 12 to (3.
Harvard claims that her eleven
was in no condition to play ball,
and the press reports give credence
to this claim. She played a hard,
uphill game against an eleven in
almost perfect physical condition
and training, but to no avail.
The Belmont preparatory school
team, which played our freshmen
several weeks ago, added another
scalp to its belt last Saturday, de
feating the University of Nevada
eleven by the score of 17 to 0.
The Yale freshmen beat Andover
Saturday, the score being 42 to 4.
The Butte eleven defeated the
Denver Athletic Club Saturday,
20 to 0. Denver was the lirst team
that beat Butte. This was last
year when the teams were almost
the same as Saturday and the
score 12 to 0.
