One serious hardship under
which our football men labor is the
lack of attention given to their foot
ball clothing. In almost every
other university of any athletic pre
tensions there is a drying room and
a person to take care of the football
clothes. There is such an official,
for example, at Berkeley and at the
club houses of Olympic and Reli
ance. At Stanford each player is
compelled to take care of his own
suit. Very few players know how
to care for football clothes as they
should be cared for, and still fewer
care to take upon themselves the
disagreeable task of beating out
mud and washing jerseys and stock
ings. Cleanliness is supposed to be
one of the canons of good training,
and yet a majority of our players
have to appear in ill-dried clothing,
offensive to the nose and to the
touch. It can not be doubted that
this unsanitary state of affairs has
its influence on the condition of the
men.
It is probably too late to remedy
the matter this season; we merely
call attention to it as a suggestion
for future years.
