There seems to be a growing dis
satisfaction with the manner in
which the University yell is given.
Jt would he well perhaps to call the

attention of the Athletic Committee
of the Associated Students, if such
matters lie within its jurisdiction,
to the objections that are being
urged against it. In the first place
the yell is given with too much
carelessness and in too mechanical
a manner. In the second place
the syllables are pronounced far too
loosely and indistinctly, so that the
words are rendered almost indis
tinguishable. Especially is this so
with the Stanford, which is given in
such a hurried and slip-shod man
ner that a person unacquainted
with the yell would never know
just for what the last sound stood.
The suggestion to be made is that
the word Stanford be pronounced
in such a manner as to make the
two syllables distinctly audible.
This can be done by dividing the
word where it properly should be
divided and pronouncing the o in
the last syllable long. The word
is essentially one of two syllables,
and to attempt to pronounce it as
one only produces a confused and
indistinct sound. Stanford is pre
eminently the most important word
in the yell, and to give it its proper
emphasis and significance will add
greatly to its power and effective
ness. It may be said that nearly
every eastern college whose name
consists of two syllables, as well as
many whose name consists of only
one, pronounce that name in the
way suggested. The most notable
example of the latter class is Vale,
whose prolonging and emphasis of
the college name is a prominent
characteristic of her yell. The ren
dition is evidently a needed and
most effective one and most of us
hope to see it introduced here.
