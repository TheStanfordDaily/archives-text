# Camp and Deland on Football.
## 
### 
Houghton, Mifflin & Company
have just issued from their press
"Football," by Walter Camp and
Lorin F. Deland. The book comes
in tasteful binding in red or blue
according to the college colors of
the reader.
Walter Camp is too well known
here to need any mention. His co
worker, Lorin F. Deland, has for
several years been Harvard's head
coach. He was the inventor and
perfector of "flying interference,"
and no one in the world possesses a
better theoretical knowledge of the
college game. Between them they
have gotten out a veritable text
book of the game, complete from
both practical and theoretical
points of view.
At the outset the history of
American football is told completely
and thoroughly, as it has never
been told elsewhere. The changes
which evolved the American game
from the English Rugby are ex
plained in detail, and their value
in the game's development shown
in full.
After a short chapter devoted to
the spectator the book takes up the
game as it relates to the player and
the coach. One general comment

covers tlie whole of this depart
ment â€”its completeness. Every
possible information concerning
the game, from descriptions of
plays to a dictionary of football
slang, is comprised within the three
hundred closely printed pages of
this section. After glancing over
the pages one is forced to believe
that there is nothing of importance
in the American game which has
not been commented on. It is, as
it was intended to be, a thorough
treatise of the game in all its as
pects, the first one ever published,
and the last one anyone is likely to
attempt for some time.
