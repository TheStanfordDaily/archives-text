Every student who intends to go
to the game on Thanksgiving day
and to be one of Stanford's yelling
section should make it a point to
he present at every practice from
now on. In order to make any
thing like a good showing at the
big game and make it evident to
the public at large that there are
Stanford enthusiasts present, every
one must do his part. The attend
ance at the game tomorrow should
be large and the cheering enthusi
astic. The yell leaders should be
given the hearty support of all.
The time is now at hand more than
ever before when the team needs to
feel that it is the Varsity.
