The public conscience was
awakened last year over the matter
of cheating in examinations. Few
of us who were here at that time
will ever forget the general up
heaval which occurred after lust
year's Economics 1 trouble. The
"student honor" committee ap
pointed at that time had its effect
on the trouble by a means wholly
different from that anticipated.
Not more than two or three cases
at most were ever acted upon by
that organization, but the fact that
it existed, and the calling into be
ing a feeling against cheating had
the intended effect. The "awakened
public conscience" of the politicians
has in this case proved more than a
fiction. Let us see that the afore
said conscience does not imper
ceptibly fall asleep again.
