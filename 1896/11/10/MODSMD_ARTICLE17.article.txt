One cause for congratulation in
the present football season lies in
the faithfulness and activity of our
second eleven. Never before has
the second team showed such a con
stant and regular attendance at
practices, or displayed such a com
mendable spirit. From now on
when so much depends upon strong
contestants for the Varsity to line
up against, this spirit should not
lag but should increase in vigor.
The student body through its rep
resentatives has endeavored to ac
knowledge in a small degree its obli
gation to the men of the second team
by offering sweaters to the twelve
most promising members. The com
petition for these sweaters should be

active, as the honor of possessing
one will full upon only a slightly
lower plane than that of the cov
eted Varsity
The second eleven has improved
its organization by the election of a
competent captain, which, with the
able coaching of one of Stanford's
former football heroes, will greatly
improve its own efficiency and also
that of the Varsity. Stanford has
good reason to be proud of the sec
ond eleven.
