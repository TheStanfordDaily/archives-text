Thk Berkeleyan in an editorial
some time ago hit the nail on the
head when it suggested a scheme
for the extensive advertising of the
university. It proposed that cer
tain university students should be
selected to carry on a correspond
ence on mutters of interest with va
rious preparatory schools and home
papers, and suggested that this
duty devolve upon members of the
Press Club, who would find the oc
cupation right in line with their
work.
The advantages claimed for such
a scheme are that it would place
many widely separated communi
ties and schools in touch with uni
versity life through the columns of
their papers; that it would awaken
an increased interest in the uni
versity's affairs; and that it would
cause many students to enter that
particular college who might other
wise have gone to some other insti
tution, through ignorance of the ad
vantages offered in the former
place.
We have a Press Club at Stan
ford, but whether its members can
be induced to undertake the work
of special correspondence depends
altogether upon their numerous of
ficial duties in connection with the
club. The scheme certainly has
many points in its favor and would
result in bringing many students
here who are at present unac
quainted with our University. The
case is cited of Williams College
which carries on a very effective
and beneficial correspondence with
various preparatory schools by
means of her press club.
