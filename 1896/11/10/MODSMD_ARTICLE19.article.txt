Stanford might derive a very
profitable lesson from U. C. in the
manner of conducting its social
events. The Berkeley freshmen
have already enjoyed their glee,
and the sophomores will soon give
their hop. This enlivens the mo
notony of the first semester and
leaves the second to the more im
portant events of the juniors and
seniors. The custom at Stanford of
allowing the freshmen to open the
social season is unnatural, the
freshmen being supposed to know
absolutely nothing of the way of
conducting a class hop. The ques
tion is being agitated in social cir
cles of urging the sophomores to
change dates with the freshmen and
thus give their cotillion this semes
ter. This would establish a new
and valuable precedent and would
surely make the cotillion more of a
social and financial success than if
crowded into next year.
