# A 						Tussle with the Dummy.
## 
### 
An innovation was introduced
into the regular routine work of the
football squad last night in the
way of special practice in the gym
nasium before the regular field
work. The chief element in this
in-door training consisted in tack
ling a dummy suspended from the
ceiling.
The scrimmage play was notice
able for the hard, conscientious
work of the second team. Paul
Downing had charge of the mem
bers of the lighter team. Their
great fault was in their unfaniiliar
itv with the signals, which pie
vented them from making as strong
a showing as they should have
made had each man mastered his
signals beforehand.
The threatening weather tended
to limit the attendance at the game
and those present seemed afraid to
open their mouths for fear of
making a noise. There was
very little yelling done and no
show of enthusiasm.

The Varsity still shows its weak
ness in running the ends. As us
ual there were no decided gains
made on end runs. All of the
long runs were on line bucks, a
slow process and one that is very
wearing on a team.
The Varsity ends showed a
marked tendency to lie drawn in.
Several times they allowed the
second team to hoodwink them by
some moss-grown old fake, as the
quarterback run and fake kick.
Cotton again carried off the hon
ors in line bucking and did some
good tackling, but his punting was
poor.
Mcintosh, with the exception of
one missed tackle, played a capital
game, getting into the plays well
and doing some very good running
with the bal 1.
Billy McLaine was out for the
lirst time and showed good form in
tackling and running.
Ilolbrook did some good work at
interference, but showed poor judg
ment in objecting to some decisions
of the umpire.
Seawright played a good defensive
game, but persists in fouling the
end when running in interference.
Freeman played a consistent
game in running, punting, and
tackling.
Rice kept the end and tackle op

posite him very busy. Straight
and Thomas spent their whole time
in pocketing Rice, while Soper was
left to break through and spoil the
plays. C. Thomas tackled well, as
did Parker and R. Smith. R.
Thomas made a capital run.
Fickert put up his usual strong
game.
The Varsity center men had very
little advantage over their op
nonents.
