Editor Daily Palo Alto: Dur
ing tbe past week the directors of
the Boating Association have issued
a brief notice calling the attention
of the students to the boating in
terests of the university. Tbe
Boating Association was organized
three years ago through the efforts
of a few students and a number of
alumni. There have been a great
many obstacles to tbe growth of
tlie association, yet it has gained
in strength' ami membership al
though not in such degree as seems
desirable.
The goal of the directors seems
to be a boating contest with your
University. Their address says:
''We must, obtain a reputation on
the water that shall demand Stan
ford's attention." With this end
in view very active preparations
are being made for boating con
tests. The first race which
the association will hold will
take place Feb. 22, and the
men are already hard at work train
ing for it. The directors also pro
pose to enter three crews in the
Pacific Coast Championship Be
gat t a.
Footbiill practice lias now be
come very lively, although several
strong men are on the injured list,
among them Ca.pt. Uansome. For
the lirst time during the season
something like organized effort in
giving the college yell has been at
tained. There is yet much room
for improvement in this regard,
however.
Twenty-five members were in
itiated at tbe annual run of the
Skull and Keys last Thursday.
The public part of the initiation
was not very interesting. The
principal requirement seems to have
been that the candidates speak to
no one except their fellows. Their
dazzling white trousers and red
ribbons, however, served to make
them objects of curiosity.
The California Magazine for No
vember is a Charles Warren Stod
dard number. The frontispiece is
a.portrait of Mr. Stoddard, and
some verse written by him es
pecially for this edition occupies a
prominent place. There are sev
eral articles and bits of verse by
members of tbe faculty and stu
dents. Bkukklkyan.
