The liowing Committee of 11:i r
vard is making negotiations with
Mr. I{. C. Lehman, the English
coach of the Leander and Oxford
crews, for the management of the
Harvard crew of 1)7. The defeat of
Yale at Henley last summer is be
lieved to he entirely due to the
superiority of the English stroke.
Mr. Lehman has conferred with
Mr. Watson, Harvard's former
coach, and has found that their
ideas on rowing were very siniiliar.
The future Harvard coach compli
mented Vale's crew very highly,
and believes that such a crew with

an English stroke would he in
vincible. The English coach is
enthusiastic, and is confident of
his ability to turn out a winning
crew if he is given the manage
ment of Harvard's rowing interests.
Arrangements are now practically
complete. The Harvard crews will
probably adopt tlie long oars and
narrow blades of the English oars
men, although the method of seat
ing the men in a straight line will
remain unchanged.
