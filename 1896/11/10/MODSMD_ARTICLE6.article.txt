# Meeting of the Zoology Club.

### 
The Zoology Club met last even
ing at Dr. Gilbert's and listened
to a report by M. B. Schofield on
his recent trip to Ilerschel Island,
Alaska. The party had a number
of thrilling adventures, and the ac
count of Arctic navigation in the
ice was extremely interesting. A
good collection of fish was obtained,
also many curious Esquimaux im
plements.
