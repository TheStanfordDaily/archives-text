# Not a Great Success.

The concert given by the Glee
and Mandolin Clubs in Oakland
on Friday night was very disap
pointing from a financial point of
view. The clubs had expected a
good-sized house, but when they
arrived in town, found that hardly
a person knew of their intended ap
pearance. Asa consequence, the
seating capacity of the V. M. C. A.
auditorium, where the concert was
held, was not very heavily taxed
1 during the evening. The total re
ceipts of the house, all of which
I went to the clubs, was some twenty-
I one dollars, not enough to pay the
expenses of the trip. It is difficult
ito determine upon whom rests the
| responsibility of the loss, but at
any rate it is evident that what ad
vertising was done was very poorly
, and injudicially managed. Aside
from a financial standpoint little
complaint can be had with the
house, the audience being except ion
ally liberal and enthusiastic in
their applause. Every number on
I the program met with a warm, re
] ception and a vigorous request for
! an encore.
