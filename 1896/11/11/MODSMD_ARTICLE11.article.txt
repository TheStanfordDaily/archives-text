Thk action of (lie Inter-Society
Debuting League in choosing for its
next subject of discussion the ques
tion of the establishment of a per
manent board of arbitration merits
tiie approval <>112 the entire Students'
Congress. I leretofore the selections
â€¢ if the league have included subjects
so threadbare and devoid of appli
cation to modern issues that the or
dinary student, other than those
leading the debate, could be ex
pected to take hardly more than a
passing interest in them. Hut in
the subject of arbitration we have
a question of vital importance at
the present moment, England hav
ing only Monday expressed her
willingness to submit her interests

in the Venezuelan affair t<> a joint j
board of arbitrators. With this se-j
lection of popular subjects for tie
hate we have no doubt that the>
Students' Congress will take its de
serving place as first among our lit-1
erary organizations.
