Our team is particularly fortu
nate in having the benefit of hard
practice with the Reliance team so
late in the season. Only three
more weeks remain before the
Thanksgiving game, and a little
valuable instruction just now will
go a long way towards putting them
in shape for the final struggle. In
terest, too, among the players is at
the top notch, and instead of there
being a smaller number of men ap
pearing on the field each night, as
was the case last year, the list is
steadily growing. All these things
augur well for our success and add
to the confidence, already ours, in
the men who are to reap glory for
themselves and for the University
on Thanksgiving day.
