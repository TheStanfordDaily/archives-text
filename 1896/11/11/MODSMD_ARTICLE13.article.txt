The interest taken in the Carnot
Medal contest this year is in a
measure going to settle the contin
uation of that event. It will be re
membered that just three persons
came forward last year as contest
ants in the preliminaries. Stanford
suffered a sound defeat, as she de
served, owing to this apathy. It
was remarked at the time that a
continuation of this feeling would
mean the final withdrawal of Stan
ford from the contest.
Shall Stanford withdraw? That
is the question we have before us
now. With five literary societies
as opposed to California's one, with
a number of good debaters still in
college, are we going to let the
medal go by default? We keep up
our football team, our track team,
our baseball team; are we going to
place all these interests above the
intellectual interests that mark a
university? In other words, are
we going to admit that Stanford, in
the front rank of the modern uni
versity movement, is putting the
"things of the flesh" above the
''things of the spirit"?
