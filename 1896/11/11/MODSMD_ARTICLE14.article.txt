# New Bicycle Path.
## 
### 
Through the interest taken by
the bicycling members of the fac
ulty the path at the right between
the University and I'alo Alto is to
be converted into a road for wheel
men. Those who live in I'alo Alto
and who ride the distance three or
four times a day will appreciate
this very much. Besides being
somewhat dangerous it ha> been
somewhat unsatisfactorv to have
the wheelmen and pedes)rians using
the same road, especially as so few
of the bicyclers have bells on their
wheels. Both parties will no doubt
hail the improvement with delight.
The path is to be thoroughly graded
and the ground well packed down
to insure smoothness. The teams
are already employed in the work
and soon the trials of pedestrians
and wheelmen will be over. The
united thanks of both interested
parties are due to the professors
whose interest in the matter has
brought about such satisfactory re
sults.
