### 
llev. Dr. Haweis of London, who
will lie remembered to have lectured
to us two years ago, has lately pub
lished a hook on his impressions of
California. Following is part of
what he has to say about what he
terms the "Leland and Stanford
IJ ni vers i ties:
-The students, as at Cornell, are
male and female, singularly free,
self-reliant, and independent. They
live all about al their own sweet
will. ... I could see from my
platform crowds of students of both
sexes standing at the open doors,
and the young men climbed up out
side and looked in at the open
windows. I have those hundreds
of fresh voting faces before me ftill.
California may be sensual,
materialistic, skeptical, superficial,
but Oalifornians are full of heart,
and the young people with small
respect for precedent and conven
tion are wonderfully receptive and
eager."
