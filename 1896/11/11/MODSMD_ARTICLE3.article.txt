# FROM LIGHT TO DARKNESS.
## A 						Long and Heavy Practice Between Stanford and Reliance. 
### 
The Varsity scored live times
last night against a team made up
iof Reliance and Stanford second-!
j eleven men. Oliver, guard, and
I Burnett, center, on the Reliance!
were not able to be here and Adams
and Bigelow took their places.
The game, although one-sided,
! was made interesting by the num-j
i erous star plays of the Stanford]
men. The practice was the longest i
of the season and lasted until after
| sunset.
Clematis, the famous halfback of
5 Stanford's early days, coached the;
Varsity backs, while Harry Walton
urged on the Reliance men.
| There was a fair crowd on the
1 bleachers and along the side-lines,
and the Oaklanders were made to I
| feel at home by having their yell
given by the Stanford crowd.
It was soon evident after the
I commencement of play that lie-j
liance was no match for the heavy I

Varsity line. It took a little
over live minutes for Stanford to
make a touch-down and the sec
ond one was made in nearlv as
quick order, while Reliance was
almost powerless to make any
tel ling ad va nces through the 1 inc.
Stanford had the advantage of
two sets of backs, one of which
was laid off and allowed to rest
while the other took its place.
Reliance made but few changes
in its original line up during the

game and w.ms .somewhat handi
capped l>v having to till two of the
center positions with Stanford men.
The Arletts, Liicunna, Piatt, and
Sexton did the hest work for Re
liance.
Cotton's bucking again proved
the feature of Stanford's plav. lie
hits the lint* hard and low, finds the
hole and never "dies" until he is
absolutely compelled to hy over
whelming weight. His example
should be studied and followed by
the other backs. Then we shall see
less of this succumbing to the iirst
touch of a tackle.
Fickert won many a yard for
Stanford by his splendid inter
ference, and would often drag the
runner on for an additional yard
or two. Fisher and Freeman hit
the line with telling force and the
latter did some very good minting.
Mcintosh showed great improve
ment in handling punts, a thing he
was called upon to do repeatedly.
Dole played a strong game.
Straight, Seawright, and l>. Thomas
each placed long runs to his credit.

Taken all in all, the Varsity
showed decided improvement, and
with the practice of the remaining
two weeks should give a good ac
count of itself on Thanksgiving.
Marry Walton said, after the
game, that. Stanford's play has im
proved in the last two weeks, in
that the men play with a great
deal more dash.
