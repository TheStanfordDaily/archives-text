# Prophetic Poem by Timothy Dwight.
## 
### 
In Sunday's ('all the following
poem, written in 171)4 by Timothy
Dwight, is printed, as prophetic of
ihe great seats of learning on the
Pacific Coast:
All hail! Thou western world, hy
1 leaven designed.
The example bright to renovate
mankind!
Soon shall thy sons across the
mainland roam,
And claim on far Pacific's shore a
home.
Their rule, religion, manners, arts
convey
And spread their freedom to the
Asian Sea.
Towns, cities, fanes, shall raise
their towering pride,
Proud commerce's mole the western
surges lave,
The long, white spire be imaged on
the wave.
Where marshes teemed with death
shal 1 meads unfold,
Untrodden cliffs resign their stores
of gold.
W here slept perennial night shall
science rise,
And new-born Oxfords cheer the
evening "skies.
