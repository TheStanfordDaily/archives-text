We hope that in the assignment
of papers and examinations during
the next two weeks an endeavor
will be made to so divide the work
that it will not become excessive.
There is a general tendency to
crowd the work in all departments.
Moreover, a great many students
are connected with the Thanks
giving game and entertainment,
either in an athletic or a musical
line, and it is doubly hard for them
to prepare for several examinations
and carry on this outside work at
the same time.
When the controversy between
the Associated Students and
the musical organizations is brought
up after Thanksgiving for final set
tlement, there should be a full un
derstanding of both sides of the
question, and it should be decided
in such a manner as to do justice
to all parties concerned. It will
not do to dismiss the matter with
out a bearing as has been done
before; but we should be able at
this time to decide definitely
whether student body control does
or does not further the interests of
the musical organizations and of
the University as well.
