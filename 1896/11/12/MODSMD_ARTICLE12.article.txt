The chilliness and uncomfort
ableness of the recitation rooms was j
a matter of frequent comment
among the students this morning.
Many were able to remain in the
rooms during the recitations only
:it considerable sacrifice and danger
of exposure to themselves. It is
safe to say that not a few of the,
chills and colds, so prevalent at I
this time of the year among the
students, are due to the unneces
sarily low temperature of the rooms
in whicli they have to sit for an
hour at a time. From now on, the!

weather will undoubtedly he cold
enough for the introduction of ;i
little heat into the recitation roomh.
and the urgent necessity of this
should not he overlooked.
