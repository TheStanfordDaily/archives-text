Editor Daily I'alo Alto: The
football game of last Saturday w;is
a disappointment to us. No one
looked for another score of 4-1-0.
hut the demoralization of our team
was quite discouraging. It is fully
acknowledged by our men that the
game was fairly won; certainly no
fault could lie found with the clean
game which the Stanford team
played.
Instructor May beck has been
busy for some time taking photo
graphsof the grounds. These views
are being made into lantern slides
which will be used by Mr. Mav
beck in his trip East and to Europe,
to give architects a clear idea of
the university's surroundings.
Capt. Kellner of the Economic
Garden has been made superintend
ent of the university grounds and
a new set of regulations has been
issued. Henceforth all laborers
must really labor and every effort
will be made to keep the grounds
i n order.
The Freshman Glee which was
held in the gymnasium last Friday
night proved to be one of the most
successful class hops ever held here.
The sophomores managed to make
way with the lemonade and so the
dancers had to thirst; otherwise
there were no mishaps.
The sophomore class is making
every effort to bring their hop,
which will be given next Friday
evening, up to the standard set by
the freshmen.
It now seems quite probable that
.Junior day will be postponed a
week, as the actors in the farce
need more time for preparation.
December (i has been fixed upon as
the provisional date for the prom
enade.
Football practice has developed
nothing new this week. Captain
Ransome is still unable to play on
account of injury. Mr. Clay Good
ing, the yelling master, has been
giving directions to the Medical
College in San Francisco during
the past week. There is still great
need of his efforts in Berkeley.
Our second eleven will g<Â» to
lieno, Nevada, on the day follow
ing Thanksgiving to play the
eleven of the University of Nevada.
The men are to be the guests of the
university and look forward to a
pleasant trip. Thk Bekkki.kyan.
