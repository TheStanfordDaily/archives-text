A recent dispatch of the Associ
ated Press reads as follows anent
the Bering Sea Controversy:
Washington, October 24. —In
spite of all the .Jingoism rampant
in Congress, the dispute between j
(ireat Britain and the United States j
over the preservation of the Alaska
seal fisheries gives every promise of j
coming to friendly and peaceful
conclusion. If advices which reach
the United Stales by way of Canada
are to be trusted, the President's |
message will contain the welcome!
news that the British government
and ours have reached a common 1
basis of fact regarding the seal fish-1
eries which will make future diplo
matic negotiations on the subject
exceedingly simple. I his is there- j
>ult of sending scientific men in
stead of politicians and diplomatists ;
to study the situation on the spot. ;
The combination was an exceed-1
ingly strong one. Prof. David S. j
.lonian, president of Leland Stan
ford .Jr. University, representing I
our country, Prof. D'Arcy rhomp-j
son, representing Great Britain,!
and James Maeoun, representing
Canada, are naturalists of high pro- |
fessional standing. Although eon
ducting their investigations on en-:
tirely independent lines, it appears!
that they reached essentially the
same conclusions on all important!
<1 uestions concerning seal lite, i
While it can not be absolutely!
stated as a fact, there is excellent
reason for believing that the Amer
ican side of the controversy is
amply sustained by their joilit find
ings. Among other things which |
they accomplished was an actual
count of the seal herds, thus setting
at rest the bickerings which have
arisen over the guesswork of politi
cians and other parties in interest
heretofore. When it is remembered
that many of the more violent
Aliglophobists in both houses of
Congress were eager to declare war
or make a hostile demonstration of
some vigorous sort <>n insufficient
information, this \£ery simple and
inexpensive way out of thediffieul ty
is a legitimate cause for congratu
lations to both countries.
