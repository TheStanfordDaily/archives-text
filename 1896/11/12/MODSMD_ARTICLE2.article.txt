# Another Practice With Reliance.
## 
### 
Reliance made ;t far better sliow
ing ;iga inst the Varsity last night
than on the preceding evening.
For one tiling the Varsity played
a decidedly loose game, while Ue
liance settled down to steadier
work.
The practice games of this week
reseinlue those played by the same
teams earlier in the season in that
Stanford made an excellent show
ing on the lirst evening in both
cases and on the second evening
put U|> a weak style of play. This
may lie accounted for in part by
the fact that Reliance needed only
a team with which to do opposition
work in order to bring out its
strong points; for the Oaklanders
have been ha udieapped throughout
the season by the lack of a second
eleven. The fact remains, never
theless, that Stanford's game is
erratic in character. At no time
during the season have the men
played two successive games of
equal snap and strength. One
good practice a week seems to be
the limit. Things will look prom
ising on one night, and almost in
variably the following night's work
is so miserable as hardly to be
credited to the same team.
Last night's practice was not ir
redeemably poor; it was, however,
nothing more than fair. It failed
to give the promise of Varsity form
that was evident Tuesday
As preliminary practice the Ue
liance men took a jog in the morn
ing under the guidance of their
trainer. They seem bent on de
veloping such form and wind as to
render impossible in their coming
struggle with Olympic the likeli
hood of a reversal of form such as
was shown in the Berkeley Ueliance
game.
Coach Cross had some of his men
on the tield during the morning
and put them through kicking and
catching practice, and in the early
part of the afternoon had them
tackle the gymnasium dummy.

The teams faced each other with
the men in the following positions:
ST A N F OK I). REM ANCK.
It Smith 1 end r Racine
Harrington. .1 tackle r. . . Newconib
Fickert 1 guard r Wells
Williams center Bigelow
Carle r guard 1 James
(.J Thomas. ...r tackle 1 Sexton
B Thomas. . . r end I . . Lacunna
Mcintosh . . . .quarter 1 Arlett
"T. o '," 1 | I half r Carter
Doie \
Fisher r half 1 Wyckoff
Freeman fullback ... .A Arlett
There was but one earned touch
down made during the game and
that was Stanford's last one. The
teams each made one on a fluke
The final score stood 8-4 in favor of
Stanford.
Carter made the best run for Ite
liance. Sexton, Lacunna, and A.
Abbott did some clever work.
Captain Fickert's defensive play
was the feature of the game, lie
broke through the line repeatedly
and tackled the runner before lit
could get started. Williams, (!.
Thomas, and Dole did some good
work, while Carle and James
worked hard against each other,
with the advantage a little in favor
of the former.
The yelling from the bleachers
was strong, but ineffective, as the
yells were not given in unison.
