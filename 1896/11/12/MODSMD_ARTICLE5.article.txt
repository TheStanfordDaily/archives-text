## What the Papers Have to Say of Her Performances in San Francisco. 
### 
Mine. Fannie Bloomfield-Zeisler,
! who wili make her first appearance
before a Stanford audience in the
| chapel tomorrow night, has been
Lnieeting with a most enthusiastic
I reception from the people of San
Francisco, where she has been 'play
ing the past week. The success of
her entertainments has been far in
excess of what the most sanguine
had hoped for, and has demon
strated that she is possessed of ;i n
I ability second only to that of the
great I'aderewski himself. Indeed
she has gained for herself the name
of being the greatest living pianiste,
and judging by the interest created
by the performance of I'aderewski
i in our midst last year, her reputa
tion will have the effect of securing
j for her a large audience of listeners
i tomorrow night.
Concerning Mine. Zeisler's play
ing n vin Francisco, this morning's
! Cull nas the following to say:
"Did you ever hear such play
-1 ing!" "Isn't it wonderful!" These
'and similar ejaculations could be
| heard as the audience went home
on Tuesday night after listening to
Fannie Bloomfield-Zeisler at the
Metropolitan Temple. Mine. Zeisler
was known berets a resident of
Chicago, who had studied in Vienna
with Lesziticki, I'aderewski's mas
ter. As she stepped upon a San
Francisco platform for the tirst
time the audience greeted her
wa rnily.
It was not till she had played,
that the audience realized what a.
j genius was among tlieni. Bach's
! Toccata and Fugue in 1) minor
(transcribed by Tausig) had been
chosen as the opening number, and
although the interpretation was a
triHecold it brought out at once
Mine Zeisler's masterly technique.
Her wrist power is exceptional
and her touch velvety, pure, and
finished. In direct contrast to the
| "Fugue" was the little Minuet in F
flat major, and the Bagatelle by
Beethoven. The selections from"The
|"The Ruins of Athens" (chorus of
Dervishes, transcribed by Saint-
Saens),and Rubinstein's transcrip
j tion of the Turkish March, showed
j off her powers effectually. The lat
ter —a piece de resistance of the
late Anton Rubinstein is a study
i in crescendo and decrescendo, and
well fitted to show off the gigantic
strength he possessed. Mine. Zeis
ler interpreted this delightfully,
even though hers was a '"feminine
' edition."
All musicians are aware of the
enormous technical, and one might
I say intellectual difficulties of Schu
mann's 41 Itltudes Sytnphoniques "
(Op. 18). Mine. Zeisler interpreted
this in a masterly manner, bring
ing out vividly the various tone
pictures contained therein. For an
j encore she gave a serenade by
Sa mi n ski.
After an 4 " Impromptu" by
Chopin (Op. 86) came his well
known Valse No. 1 (Op. 64). Her
strongly characteristic rendition of
this brought down the house, and
she repeated the number for an en
core.
Moskowski's " (Jondoliera " (Op.
11) and Liszt's '• Twelfth Rhap

sodie" brought the program to :i
close. The audience rose en masse,
actually shouting, and instead of
going home demanded another en
core, which Mine. Zeisler obligingly
gave by playing a composition of
Lesziticki's Les Deux Alouettes.'.'
