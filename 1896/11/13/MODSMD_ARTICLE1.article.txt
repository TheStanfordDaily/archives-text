# ON THE GRIDIRON.
## A 						Third Practice With Reliance. 
### 
Yesterday's practice begun the I
last two weeks of work before tbe
big game—weeks that in the past
have counted so much for Stanford
in putting the finishing touches on
the team. From now on every ef-1
fort will be directed towards bring
ing the men to such form ihatj
every individual movement shall
have its effect in strengthening the'
team as a whole, until the eleven!
men shall lose their identity as in- I
dividual? and each shall become
but a part of a larger whole, work-\
ing with the unity of movement of j
a perfectly adjusted machine.
There are many things to be over-!
come before this state of things can
be brought about, but with our
corps of coaches we believe that it;
will be accomplished. In the first;
place the men must overcome the
smaller faults that were so evident j
in last night's practice, such as
giving the play away by the po-j
sition of the body or by the move
ment of the eves in the direction in i
which the ball is to go. Then the
knowledge of the formation for the j
different plays must be mastered by'
the men.
One of the severest criticisms I
on Stanford's play made by the Re- j
liance men was that the men did
n«»t seem to understand formation I
for interference, and even when
they did take their positions to
ward off tacklers they were so slow
in moving that the interference lost
its effectiveness. The interference
was much stronger round Stan
ford's right end last night than
round the opposite end. This is
probably due to the fact that Fick
ert did such excellent work in
blocking for the runner. It seems
to be the rule that the opposing
halfbacks make the majority of
tackles when the Varsity attempts j
to circle the ends. Although Stan
ford kept the ball in the Reliance
lot most of the time last night, it;
was nevertheless evident that the
athletic, club men, especially be
hind the line, worked together bet
ter. Stanford's advantage lay in
the fact that the linemen outclassed
their opponents in defensive work.'
Last night's practice was the
last for the Reliance men before
their important game with Olym
pic on Saturday, and although they
did not present their strongest
teiim in any of the practices on the
campus, they proved beyond a
doubt that they have a great deal
of power and are capable of taking
advantage of opportunities by tbe
wonderful improvement shown in
their work after the few days of
practice. With their strong men
in their regular positions they
should make an excellent showing
in the game.
Carter, formerly of Stanford, is
one of their strongest ground gain
ers. He has that never-die spirit
which is lacking in so many of
Stanford's runners. A. Arlett is ;i
capable man in defensive work, and
Wells puts up a very creditable
game at guard Laeunna. at end,
has proved himself a decidedly
good end.
For the Varsity, Harrington and
Williams did some capital tackling
last night. Carle's work was up to

his usual high standard. Straight,
Cotton, 11. Smith, and Parker
gained well around the ends, while
•lost, Cotton, Parker, and Rice did
the strongest line-bucking.
McLaine showed up well as an
end. To quote a Reliance man,
"Hilly is a very 'shifty'end." lie
broke up the interference well and
was seldom drawn in.
After about thirty minutes'
practice against Reliance the Var
sity lined up against the second
eleven for ten minutes more of hard
work.

There was little enthusiasm
shown by the spectators. As there
remains but a week of practice on
the campus it would be well for tne
yell leaders to make the best of the
time and drill their sections as
much as possible during that time.
