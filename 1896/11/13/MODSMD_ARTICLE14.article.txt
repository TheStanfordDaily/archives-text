The loyalty of Stanford's gradu
ate Varsity players, as well as those
who have been prominent in vari
ous lines of athletics, to the Uni
versity interests was never more
strikingly shown than this year,
in response to the call for addi
tional men to assist in coaching the
football team during the few days
remaining before the game, they
have come generously to our assist
ance, many at a sacrifice to them
selves. It is such loyalty as this
that infuses ginger and energy into
the men and reminds us that our
football interests will never be al
lowed to suffer so long ms we have
patriotic alumni to depend upon.
