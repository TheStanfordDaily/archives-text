A flourishing press club has
been organized at Berkeley this se
mester whose aim it is to arouse in
terest in literary work, to extend the
fair name of the university, and es
pecially to advance the interests of
the university publications. A sim
ilar organization has long existed
at Stanford, but it has existed ap
parently in name only. The liter
ary workers of a university are an
important element in its make-up,
and there is no reason why they
should not maintain an organiza
tion for mutual help and improve
ment. Moreover, they have much
to gain from association and could
doubtless do much by concerted ef
fort to add to the reputation of
their alma mater. We need such
an organization at Stanford. Let
some one undertake to instill new
life into our Press Club.
