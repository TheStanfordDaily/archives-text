# The 						University Band at the Game.
## 
### 
Now that Thanksgiving is draw
ing near it is well to review the or
ganizations that will go to make
up the success of that day. The
University Band, which has hereto
fore been such a feature on Thanks
giving day, will this year be up to
its former standard of excellence,
both in numbers and proficiency.
The members have been rehearsing
twice a week for over a month, and
although a great many new men
have been taken in, splendid prog
ress has been made.
It.was the intention some time
ago to give a band concert in the
court of the Palace Hotel on the
morning of the game, in connection
with a reception given to the Class
of '95, but owing to a number of
reasons this feature will probably
be abandoned. However, it is the
intention to march around the grid
iron just before the game, as was
done at the Ilaight street game two
years ago.
As for uniforms, the Band will
wear this year white mortar-boards
with cardinal tassels, and white
duck trousers.
