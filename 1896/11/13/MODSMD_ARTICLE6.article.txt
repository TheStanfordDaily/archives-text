# Law Lecture.
## 
### 
Professor Pol ley addressed the
Law students Wednesday evening
on the subject, "How far is it safe
to criticise a candidate for public
office? " The attendance wassmall,
due in part to other meetings being
held at the same hour, and also to
the fact that the lecture was a legal
one and hence appreciable only by

those engaged in legal study. In
the course of the lecture, however,
Prof. Polley brought out many
points based on his experience
which were of much value.
The chief point discussed in de
tail was that of the distinction be
tween libel or utterances of a de
famatory character when directed
against a candidate for public of
fice and when uttered against an
other person. A private person
when libelled has recourse to law,
but the fact of one's being a can
didate for public office places hint
in a position where he may be criti
cised or defamed to any extent that
the public good may demand.
