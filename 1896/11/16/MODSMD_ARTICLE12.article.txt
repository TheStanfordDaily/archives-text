Thk almost total absence of slug
ging and dirty work, which is usu
ally expected to he the complement
of athletic club contests on the
gridiron, in the game between Re
liance and Olympic last Saturday
is a matter for them to be proud of.
The men played like gentlemen,
and the officials were at no time
compelled to think of disqualifying
a man. When people are taught
by such examples that the game is
a clean one and the sport a legiti
mate one, football wil I cease to lie
criticised, and the public will pat
ronize the game to a greater extent.
