Each day's ''practice" on the
bleachers adds more and more to
the impression that something
should be done to change the man
ner of giving our college veil. To
those who have listened to it night
after night there can lie but one
conviction â€”that the last part of the
yell as given is decidedly faulty.
The reasons why it should he
changed and suggestions looking
toward its improvement appeared
in these columns a few days ago.
It was there suggested that the
matter be referred to the Athletic
Committee of the Associated Stu
dents for decision, but that body
has not seen lit to act upon it.
Can not then, as long as the com
mittee is indifferent or believes that
the matter lies without its powers,
the question be submitted to the
regularly ajrpointed " yell com
mittee." Surely such a committee
would have the authority to make
the desired change, and with as
many arguments in its favor, there
is little doubt in the minds of most
of us that the change will l>e made.
It is growing late we know, but it
is ''never too late to mend," and for
that reason we would urge all the
greater haste. Will not the yell
committee take the matter in hand
and see if an arrangement can not
lie made whereby the power and ef
fectiveness of the veli may be in
creased at least two-fold?
