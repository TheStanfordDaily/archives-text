Editor Daily Pau> Ai/ro: The
student body here has evidently
not yet begun to realize that the
great football game is not far dis
tant. A somewhat larger number
are attending the practice games,
but there is little display of enthu
siasm. A meeting of the Associ
ated Students was held in the big
tent last Thursday to devise means
of arousing a proper interest among
the students. Captain Brown,
Manager Reinhardt, and Yelling
iMaster (Jooding addressed the meet
ing and did their best to impress
upon the students the necessity for
vigorous support of the team.
Several matters relating to the seat
ing at the park and the college
songs and emblems were also con
sidered.
The announcement of Captain
Dole's agreement to give us in
struction in lacrosse has aroused
considerable interest in the game.
It is certain that a large number
will be ready to try their hand in
t he game.
The lirst review of the troops
this year was held Thursday after
noon in honor of Colonel Shatter.
The freshman class has added such
a large number of cadets that two
battalions have been formed, each

ary professor of Military and Pub
lic Hygiene.
A new course is to be introduced
in the College of Natural Sciences,
arranged especially for those who
intend to enter the medical co lege.
It will lead to the degree of B. S.

the old course in biology except,
that more attention will be paid to
physiology.
The Student Congress held a very
interesting debate last. Wednesday
upon the question,'' Should the jury
system be abolished?' The argu
mentation class has met with the
Congress regularly every other
meet ing this yea rand the result
has been very satisfactory.
The sophomore hop was given
last night in the gymnasium.

(mi with a collection of street-car
head-lights as luminants.
Rehearsals of the junior farce

the Macdonough Theater in Oak
land It is to be presented on the
afternoon of 1 )ec. •">.

iner of the university, was thrown
from bis horse while returning
