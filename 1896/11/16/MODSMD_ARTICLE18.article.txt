### 
"Lan McLaren" delivered the Ly
man Beeeher course of lectures at
Yale this year. The Yale A 'em
gives Dr. Watson's opinion of Yale
and education in this country as
follows:
"In the magnificence and splen
dor of the buildings and appoint
ments there is nothing equal to it
in Oxford or Cambridge. There
are not men in England rich
enough to erect such buildings as
the Vanderbilt dormitory. The
Yale gymnasium is certainly mag
nificent, being far ahead of any
thing in that line a broad.
" 1 he faculties are very much la rger
here than in England which, of
course, makes the work more ef
ficient. There is much less cere
mony and restriction here than
abroad. In England all students
are obliged t«» wear their caps and
gowns except when not attending
college exercises. All the students
must be in at ten o'clock and every
college must be at table together.
A single building such as Vander
bilt or Welch would he called a col
lege. . . . The curriculum in
both countries is much the same.
England is fast adopting the elec
tive system so popular here.
"In fact, in every particular ex
cept those advantages which time
alone can give, Yale compares
most favorably with England's
best universities. This country is
a much richer one than England
and the desire for education is
much greater. Vealtli of itself is
a questionable advantage, but when
judiciously used, as it seems to
have been in this country, it can
accomplish great good. America
certainly has a future."
