# The 						Practice on Friday.
## 
### 
Friday night's practice was
marked by slow and loose playing.
On account of the rather extensive
hospital list (he second team was
weakened hy the withdrawal of its
halfbacks to fill the vacancies on
the Varsity, consequently the first
team had too much of a walk-over.
A number of the second team
men were unfamiliar with their
signals and caused inexcusable de
lay. Furthermore, a halt was
called now and then to allow some
freshman to express his ideas as to
how a play should be executed. A
few 01 these men -eem to be labor
ing under the impression that they
know more about football than the
coaches, although it must be ad
mitted that some little confusion is
caused in the second eleven by sev
eral different coaches instructing
the men to play their positions in
as many different ways. No doubt
anyone manner is excellent, but
when a green player is given a
number of different orders he nat
urally becomes somewhat rattled.
There was a small crowd in at
tendance at the practice â€”too small,
considering the limited number of
days left before the game. This
week should see the bleachers
crowded every night.
On Saturday there was no line-up.
Practice had been called at 0),
but there were too few second
eleven men on hand to admit of
scrimmage work. The time was
spent in signal practice.
