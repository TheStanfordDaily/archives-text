# Olympic-Reliance Game.

### 
The fonihail game at Central
Park Saturday between Olympic
and Reliance was not a great one
I»v any means. The play was not
what, it generally is in the annual
game between the two athletic
elubp. An audience of about (>OOO
people sat impassively by and
watched the game drag along.
They were stirred to applause but
few times by a dashing individual
play here and there. It was not a
college game played in college form
though, and a great deal of enthu
siasm could not be expected.

Almost all the critics who had
ventured an opinion conceded the
game to Olympic, and it looked
like their predictions were to he
confirmed in the first part of the
first half. Olympic started out
with a rush, and hy a long run of
Nolan, and successive plunges
through the center made a touch
down in ahout seven minutes from
the call of time. Reliance had
been playing a lifeless, half-hearted
game, hut when she saw defeat
staring her in the face the hrace-up
was wonderful to see. Olympic
could not find a hole in the line
during the rest of the game, though
the ends were often drawn in and
Reliance lost ground. The Oak
land men were several times on the
point of making a
when fumbling lost them the ball.
However, they seemed not to have
much difficulty in keeping the ha 11
in Olympic territory. The half
ended with the Olympic men
jubilant over the score of 4-0,
W'eldon having failed in his try for
goal.
The second half was, if possible,
slower and characterized by more
bad playing than the first. Al
though Reliance succeeded in keep
ing the ball in Olympic territory, in
a desperate attempt at touch-down,
the individual playing of the Olym
pics was far the best. After a vast
amount of hard line-bucking, with
the ball changing hands repeatedly
on downs, Reliance succeeded in
making a touchdown by Lacuna
on Olympic's fumble of a passed
ball. Wyekoff failed to kick the
goal and the score stood 4-4. No
more points were made in the few
minutes of play left, but Olympic
was clearly gaining ground, which
would have undone the tit; had not
time been called.
Olympic undoubtedly played the
best game and would have won
had it. not been for the accident
which Lacuna took advantage of.
Reliance, however, showed that she
had sand and grit in the hard game
slut put up and doubtless deserved
the reward she got. For Olympics,
Nolan, Snowden, and Code distin
guished themselves, while Walton,
Oliver, Lacuna, ami Wyekoff played
the game for Reliance. Arlett fol
lowed the ball in fine style. Both
of the touch-downs were made be
tween the posts, and there is no ex
cuse for the goals not being kicked.
The slowness of the game was in
no small measure due to the lax
ne s of the officials, although the
criticisms in the morning papers of
the decisions of Frankenheimer,
Kickert, and Downing were very
unjust.
The most pleasant feature of the
game was the almost entire ab
sence of slugging. The game was
clean and those who went with the
expectation of seeing a bruising
match were disappointed.
