# A 						Correction.

### 
lii the report of Prof. Pol ley's
Law lecture delivered last Wednes
day, the following erroneous state
ment appears:
"A private person when libelled
lias recourse to law, but the fact of
one's being a candidate for public
office places him in a position
where he may be criticised or de
famed to any extent that the public
good may demand."
The facts in the ease are as fol
lows: The law protects a candidate
from false charges maliciously
made; but he has no cause of ac
tion if the charges are made byway
of criticism upon his public acts by

parties who address the Same to tlie
electors of the district, with an hon
est belief in the truth that it is
founded upon reasonable grounds,
after careful investigation, and
made also with the sole desire of
the public general welfare, and not
to gratify private malice.
