# Athletics vs. Scholarship.
## 
### 
80 much space nowadays is given
in all the papers —not only college
journals hut news dailies as well—
to college athletics, that among a
great body of intelligent Americans
the idea has become prevalent that
athletics is crowding scholarship
out in the struggle for supremacy.
It may allay the fears of such to
learn that at Vale, a representative
institution, a larger number of men
from the junior class have attained
the Phi Beta Kappa standing than
ever before recorded at that univer
sity, despite the recent raising of
the requirements. In addition let
it be said that the number of can
didates for the football team is less
than for years past. —Oberlin Stu
