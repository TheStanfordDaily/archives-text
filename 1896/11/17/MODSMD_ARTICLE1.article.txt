# The 						Thanksgiving Vaudeville.
## 
### 
Having temporarily reconciled
themselves with each other and the
world at large, our musical organi
zations have gone ahead with prep
arations for the Thanksgiving
''show." The time is short, hut the
actors have at last to work, and
it is expected that the vaudeville
will he better than ever before.
As was the case last year, the
/tiece <le rcxixtunce will he a burlesque
by C. K. Field. This burlesque
will be more extensive and more
ambitious than last year's. No
less a personage than Win. Shaks
pere furnished the original play
at which the burlesque aims his
shafts. "The Macbethsof Berkeley"
is the title of the production, which
includes the usual number <>i' local
hits, football matter, and comic
solids. Field appears as Lady Mac
beth.
The Stanford ballet has been res
urrected for the occasion. The
Hawaiian premiere with the. unpro
nounceable name will not he able
to assist in the festivities this year,
but the management has announced
that they have discovered a new
and elongated star in the junior
class. The charming coryphees
will pertorm a '"winter ballet"
modelled on the one produced
lately at, the Tivoli.
Fraulein Pumpernickel, who
danced her way into Stanford hearts
last year, is on the program fora
serpentine dance, with calcium
effects, and Senorita Dilloni
will probably <iive a skirt dance.
The Glee Club is down for three
numbers and the Mandolin Club
for two. Ihe clubs lnive improved
greatly this year; it is the opinion
of competent judges that they were
never so good, especially the Glee
Club. This latter organization has
two or three new songs ready for
the occasion.
This is all the information at
present volunteered by the man
agement. There are deep hints,
however, of surprises in the way of
solos, specialties, and Irish comedy
sketches.
