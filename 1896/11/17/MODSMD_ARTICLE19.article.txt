It is early, but not too early, to
warn students concerning their con
duct Thanksgiving night. Two
years ago, it will be remembered, a
promiscuous assemblage of "round
ers," city toughs, and cheap sports
took advantage of Stanford's victory
to wear cardinal ribbon and to
carry on a general reign of terror in
certain quarters or San Francisco.
Not one tenth of the disturbance
raised that night was due to college
men, but the average citizen nat
urally inferred that the wearer of a
red chrysanthemum was a Stanford
man. The San Francisco news
papers, never too partial to Stan
ford, took up the cry. The Exam
iner frothed at the mouth for days
and days. The Arc/onaut poured
forth its alleged humor and its at
tempted sarcasm, resembling noth
ing so much as a cow trying to
waltz. It was in vain that the
president of the University ex
plained the personnel of the rioters
and demanded proof of complicity
by Stanford men. That mighty
organ, the modern sensational
newspaper, can not afford to ac
knowledge a mistake, and scorns
proof. The fiat went forth, and to
this very day there are good but
misguided people in San Francisco
who display holy horror at the
mention of Stanford students and
football.
If we win this year there will
probably be the same difficulty. It
is in our power to a great extent to
check any such disturbance. Some
of us remember how a few students
took cardinal ribbon off a book
maker who was rendering himself
obnoxious at the baseball game last
year. This is the treatment that
we should accord to the class of
disturbers who defamed us two
years ago. When a Stanford man
finds a disorderly character wearing
our color, it is his duty to see that
it is recovered. We are not advo
cating a disturbance, remember,
but a firm stand on a matter which
concerns the fair fame of Stanford.
