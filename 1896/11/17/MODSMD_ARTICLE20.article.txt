Before a large crowd of spectators
the corner-stone of the new Ameri
can University, the magnificent
institution founded by the Method
ist Episcopal Church of America,
was laid at Washington, Oct. 20.
Bishop Hurst of that church and
chancelorof the university to be,
delivered l he address, ;.n interesting
exposition of the views of the be
lievers in secular education. He
said in part:
This hour is one toward which
our thoughts have been directed
and on which our faith has been
centered for more than five years of
waiting and of working. This
picturesque plateau on which we
assemble today was bought, not be
because t here was money with which
to pay for it, but because of a firm
belief that not only the particular
Protestant Church which we repre
sent needed this center for higher
education, but because it was a
Protestant need of the whole
country. With no one great bene
factor to buy the laud or to erect
the buildings or to provide the en
dowments, our appeal has been to
tlie great coinmona lit v of American
patriots and the still greater com
monality of Christians throughout
the world. The response has been
more than our most ardent hopes.
Our object has been to found here
a university in harmony with the
great demands of the century, and
to furnish facilities equal to those
of the foremost universities of the
Old World.
We have learned already that
tins transcendent object appeals
not only to the judgment and the
sympathies of leading minds in
church and state, but the generous
hearts and open hands have given
such proof as only sacrifice can lay
upon the altar of our Lord.
It is highly proper that our group
of noble edifices should begin with
the College of History. This science
takes the first place, by the right of
its hi (ill functions, in the develop
ment of a great educational
scheme â€”a modern, a complete and
and an American university.
George Washington was the first
to conceive the importance of plant
ing here at the national capital a
great university. His grounds for
advocating it were based upon po
litical considerations, namely, that
the American citizen should be
trained in America in order to he
saved from monarchical and other
notions unfavorable to thedevolop
nient of citizenship in a great re
public; but a century of national
history has taught us that the true
university needs more than that.
11 needs to open its doors for the de
velopment. of science based upon
the word of God, in harmony with
the divine teachings, and in full
faith in the triumph of Christianity
over all wrong, be it in hut or pal
ace
While this institution is under
the auspices and care of onedenom
ination, there are on its board of
trustees representatives of six re
ligious bodies, all of whom most
cordially co-operate for the achieve
ment of its noble mission. It is
safe to say that in the accumula
tions of our funds for the site, for
buildings, for endowments, and for
other purposes, one half of the noble
sum has come from members of
Protestant denominations other
than our own. In the manage
ment of its affairs and in the dis
placement or election of its officers
and professors, no word of author
ity will be either asked or awaited
from the wearer of the papal tiara
in the Vatican at Rome.
Other structures will be needed,

and for some of them initial gifts
have already been made, notably
for the College of Languages, toward
which $50,000 has been contributed,
and the Asbury Memorial Hall, for
which the clergy have subscribed
$100,000, and in which we purpose
that the College for Missionaries
shall tind a home, and that thou
sands of Christian men and women
shall receive, in the languages of
the countries they are to visit, in
| comparative religions, and inter
national law. the highest equip
ment for carrying most intelligently
' the gospel to the babbling nations
lof all the earth. For the further
prosecution of this work we invite
j the sympathies, the prayers, and
I the gifts of all the people who feel
i that the lime has come for the es
tablishment in Washington, where,
in response to the appeal of the
! American University, the Genera)
! Government has thrown open to
'every scientific student its immeas
urable treasures of literature, sci-
I ence, and art, of a university which
l shall he pervaded by a Christian
atmosphere and conducted in har
