# Settling Down.
## 
### 
The team evidenced by its work
last night that it is settling down
to Varsity form. The idea of for
mation for interference lias at last
been mastered by the Varsity men,
and as a consequence the play was
steady and consistent. There are
still a number of faults that are to
be overcome before it. can be actu
ally said that the team is in prime
condition.
There were too many muffed
punts last night. The backs are
still apt to depend too much on one i
another, and often one will leave
the ball for the other to take, even !
though he himself has a betterl
chanee for it.
It was impossible to judge of the i
end-running ability of the backs,
for nearly all the plays were di
rected against the line.
The second team was handi
capped again in the matter of
backs, and was unable to do much
in offensive work, although its de
fense was comparatively strong.
Once or twice it fooled its stronger
rival by fake kicks and quarter
back runs, and twice worked the
ball to the Varsity twenty-yard
line.
The li rst. team scored several
times, chiefly by bucking the line.
Several Reliance men were on the
field but did not line up for oppo
sition play. W alton and Code lent
great assistance •to the corps of
coachers.
Daley and Mc.lntosh did the
strongest work for the second team.
Their defensive work was capital.
McLaine made the best showing of
any of the ends. He displayed
knowledge of the game and tackled
splendidly. Parker the line
with a vim, and could be counted
on for bis distance every time.
Freeman did some very fair {dint
ing but his best work was on the
defensive. Burnett was out again
and played center for the second
team. He is said by Williams to
be the strongest candidate he has
been called upon to face. Carle
showed himself fully capable of
holding up his end in the interfer
ence.
