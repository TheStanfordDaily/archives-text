The grandstand woke up this
evening and did the first concerted
veiling of the season. The new
method of drawing out the yell was
tried for the first time, and it took
with the crowd. It seems much
more effective than the old way,
and will probably be an improve
ment when the crowd gets used to
it. Tomorrow night there will be
a special effort to arouse enthusi
asm. The Band will be out in
force, and some of the old songs
will he practiced. As soon as the
faculty committee decides on the
prize song and returns the "una
vailable" a song pamphlet will be
gotten out.
