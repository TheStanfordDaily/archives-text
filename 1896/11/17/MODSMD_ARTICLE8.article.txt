# The
						Butte-Nebraska Game.
## 
### 
The football eleven of the Uni
versity of Nebraska was defeated
last week by the liutte, Montana,
team by a score of to 11. Butte
has this year almost the same team
as last. McMillan, Hooper, Las
well, and Dygart are again playing
this year, and Benson, the former
IJ. C. captain, is playing quarter.
McMillan is playing this year as
half-back and is noted for his line
bucking. Butte outclassed the col
legians in weight, scoring the lirst
touch-down in two and a half min

utes. The Nebraskans took n brace
however, and scored their six points
mainly through a quarter-back
kick. Butte scored once more in
the lirst half and twice in the sec
ond, making the final score 20 to 6,
only two goals being kicked. The
college boys played a quick game,
but were unable to form any inter
ference against Butte's heavy line.
Butte is regarded as champion of
the Rocky Mountain region, having
recently defeated the Denver Ath
letic Club team, their conquerors
last year.
