# Assuming Form.
## 
### 
r Fhe play in last night's football
practice showed some decidedly
strong points as well as some that
were lamentably weak. The great
est noticeable sign of improvement
was in the matter of following the
ball. The men were, as a rule,
close np on the pigskin in every
play, and seemed at last to grasp
the idea that the runner must be
guarded, evidenced purtiularly in
C. Thomas's long run when he
was protected by the interfer
ence of half the team.
Another encouraging feature was
the dasli with which the team
played. The practice wasenergetic
throughout.
There was evidence, however, of
three faults of which the team was
presumed to be reasonably tree.
The lirst and greatest was the fail
ure of the line to hold long enough
to permit the fullback to punt.
Twice when the ball was in danger
ous proximity to the Varsity's goal
the comparatively weak Reliance
line broke through and blocked the
kicks. Another weak spot in the
work was the tendency of the backs
t > tnuff punts. Murphy, whose
work in tiiis respect has been re
markably clean heretofore, showed
a decided reversal of form. It was
probably caused by over-anxiety,
and if so, this can easily be over
come.
Again, the men showed weakness
in allowing Ililborn to make his
long run. The first mistake was
made by Straight in allowing him
self to be drawn in, although even
after the runner had rounded the
end the backs should not have al
lowed him to make so large a gain,
for lie was entirely unassisted and
was not downed until he had run
in touch.
The game was between Stanford
and a patchwork team made up for
the most part of Reliance men. As
will be seen by the line-up the Re
liance presented a very weak line
and did not have its best backs in
the field. One end and the center
positions were filled by second
eleven men. '
Hilborn, J. and A. Arlett, and
Wells played the strongest game
for Reliance.
''Hilly" McLaine played his po
sition for all it was worth, in tack
ling, running with the ball, and in
terfering. His blocking for Cotton
on a long gain was one of the pret
tiest plays seen here this season.
Cotton did some capital work, but
should master the art of using the
straight arm. With his weight
this should be very effective. Once
last night a simple shoulder thrust
might have meant a touch
down.
Parker's work in ground gaining
as well as on the defense was very
strong. He has developed into one
of the best halfbacks in the squad.
Jeffs played with his old-time
spirit. He made one tackle in
particular that was of a star order
to say the least. C. Thomas and
Harrington did some praiseworthy
playing. The former's long run
showed a decided quickness in tak
ing advantage of opportunities.
Murphy's playing was clean and
true, and, under Harrelson's coach
ing, he got into the interference
much better than usual Carle got

through the line well and broke up
a number of plays.
There were eight coachers on the
field: Walton, Oliver, and Pringlej
for Reliance, and Cross, Clemans,
Frankenheimer, Downing, Harrel
son, and Code for Stanford.
The crowd on the bleachers
showed a little of the ''Thanksgiv
ing spirit" and cheered lustily for
both sides.
