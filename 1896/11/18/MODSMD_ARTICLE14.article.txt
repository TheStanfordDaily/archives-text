Now that Sword and Sandals
has been reorganized, we have a
right to expect a re-awakening of
dramatic activity. It isabouttime
that our amateurs should attempt
something in the dramatic line other
than comic operas, vaudevilles, or
class farces. We have come to that
point where something more serious
is needed. We don't mean by this
to advise our amateurs to attempt
"Hamlet" or Greek drama, but it
seems as though we were possessed
of enough dramatic talent to get a
little nearer to "the legitimate."
