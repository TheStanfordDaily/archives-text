Today's Call stated a little pre
maturely that the team was going
at the end of this week to Congress
Springs, near Saratoga. Congress
Springs has been investigated as a
possible location, but the time and
place of the team's retirement have
not yet been decided upon. Con
gress Springs has the advantage
over Woodside in being some fif
teen or sixteen miles away, making
it impossible for visitors to impede
the work. The team has been
somewhat hampered in former
years by the presence of well-mean
ing visitors.
It is expected now that the team
will not leave until Saturday, so
that Friday's practice game will
probably be held here. About
twenty-six or twenty-seven men
will be'taken to the Springs.
