The following is a synopsis of
Dr. Elliott's lecture in the chapel
last evening. His subject was,
"Hezekiah Niles," an old-fashioned
journalist.
Although Hezekiah Niles had a
very interesting personality his bi
ography has never been written.
He was in no sense a genius; he
possessed a fine and uncorrupted
sense of dignity, and served the in
terests of the larger and better
American spirit. Hislifewas spent
just before the Union, and was a
sturdy devotion to American lib
erty. His success was individ
ual; he was not associated
with public life.
The Philadelphia Register, of
which he was the editor, was con
ducted for twenty-five years, and
contains historical documents very
valuable in American history.
Hezekiah Niles was born in Penn
sylvania in 17(»7. His grandfather
was a boot-maker, his father a
carpenter, and he himself was for
some time apprenticed to a printer.
He was not, however, contented to
continue this calling in life,but had
a very high sense of his journalistic
ability. He cherished a profound
respect for public institutions, and
believed that it should be instilled
into children's minds at school.
He recognized no man as his su
perior, yet always spoke his mind
as a gentleman. He was always
interested in politics, and journal
ism was his natural element.
In 1811, when he was thirty-four
years of age, he published his Weekly
Register. On bis death, in April
1 SoD, his son took charge of the pa
per. It was a register of political
history and was valuable on ac
count of its accuracy. It was
eagerly sought by public men; its
pages were crowded with the
speeches of congressmen, which
seemed to Niles essential in their
entirety, lie often published sup
plements at his own expense, which
were then much more important
than now. The Register is free
from partisanship and is an educa
tive work of great value. Niles
toiled at his desk ungrudgingly, de
voting all his time to public ser
vice. Punctilious Niles —one can
imagine him at his desk in his
dingy office. He was fussy and un
duly sensitive, persistently resented
the many spiteful attacks on his
Register, lie was careful never to
deceive the public mind and never
did anything that he should dislike
ha ving done to him.
His literary style was desultory
and disjointed. His sentences
stretched on and on to an inter
minable length. lie hesitated
even to use a period. Niles, with
characteristic modesty, regarded
himself as an elder but not a better
soldier. This unswerving, single
minded devotion to a great cause,
was in him a passion. He was a
leader and moulder of public opin
ion.
