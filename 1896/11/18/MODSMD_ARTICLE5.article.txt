The entertainment to be given l>y
Mr. Frank Lincoln in the chapel
Friday evening promises to I><* one
of the most enjoyable of the present
semester. The reputation <>112 Mr
Lincoln us a humorist, mimic, and
a creator of laughter can scarcely

be equalled by any humorist now
before the public. The use he
makes of music renders him all the
more popular. Mr. Lincoln has
been making a tour of the Pacific
Coast this year, and has every
where received large and appreci
ative audiences. Mr. Lincoln ex
pressed a strong desire to appear
before a Stanford audience, which
has lead up to the present enter
tainment, which is under student
body management.
Mr. Lincoln gave an entertain
ment at San .lose last Friday even
ing, and the San .Jose Mercury of
Nov. 14 has the following to say of
his efforts:
"'Frank Lincoln, theinpersonator
and imitator, entertained an audi
ence that tilled the Second Presby
terian Church last evening for
nearly two hours. The programme,
for the entertainment was more
nearly a programme than a lecture,
opened with a discussion of various
phases of humor and wit and soon
drifted into story telling and im
personations of striking character
istics of different nationalities,
classes and ages of people, inter
spersed with imitations of various
musical instruments. Mr. Lincoln
is a good story-teller, and he im
personates exceedingly well, but
it is as an imitator that he is at
his best. He presented together a
whole orchestra and an opera singer
at one time, and tilled the house
with laughter at his rendition of
a buzzing mosquito and the speech
of a Chicago anarchist. The nudi
ence was kept in the hest of humor
throughout."
Seats are twenty-five and fifty
cents. Tickets will be on sale Thurs
day at the postoffice, along with the
football and vaudeville tickets.
