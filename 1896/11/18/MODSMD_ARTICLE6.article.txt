### 
This extract from a letter by Jack
Reynolds, now at Columbia Col
lege, is self-explanatory:
"The Stanford crowd here is go
ing to celebrate in an appropriate
manner the victory that we know
will be ours on Thanksgiving day.
We are going down in the evening
to a place called the 'Arena,' simi
lar in character to the Zinkand in
San Francisco, and have a jolly
evening of it from 8 o'clock onward.
I write to know if we can depend
upon you to telegraph us the re
sults of the game as soon as it is
over and settled. We have every
confidence that Stanford will win,
for she never has been beaten and
we see no reason why she should
ever be, for there are certainly just
as good athletes right there now as
ever have been. We expect to have
the following men together on that
evening: .1. I\. Wight, '93, T. <1.
Russell, '95, N. B. Knox, '95, F. C.
Kessinger, '95, Rob Crowell, '95,
Horace Campbell, ex-'96, J. E.
Lawshe, '96, G. F. Vanderveer, '96,
C. H. Labbe, '9(5, G. H. Cochran.
'96, J. T. McGrew, '96, 11. B. Rey
nolds, 'i)(5, J. E. Reynolds, '9(5, Mil
ler, Mace, '96, A. B. Spaulding,
'96. C. B. Pinkham, '96, Bill Camp
bell, '96."
Of this list Cochran, Reynolds,
Spalding, and Campbell were on
last year's Varsity.
