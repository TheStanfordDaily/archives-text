# A 						Slow Practice
## 
### 
The practice last night began
with considerable snap, and for the
tirst part of the game the ball was
kept moving in lively fashion.
Then two or three men were in
jured and retired, and for the rest
of the time the players seemed to
be cautious and afraid to throw
themselves into the scrimmage, and
the game became very slow.
Cross donned a suit and got into
the game as right guard on the sec
ond eleven for the purpose of wak
ing Fickert up. Until Cross played
out, owing to lack of training, the
two had an interesting and pretty
even struggle, Fickert using his
head to pretty good advantage
Murphy's kicking game is not
showing up so well as was expected
at the beginning of the season. It
was erratic, somewhat slow, and un
satisfactory as to distance. The
two or three blocked kicks early in
the game were due more to his
slowness than to any other cause.
He made one fair run.
Jeffs was not exerting himself
last night for fear of aggravating
his recent injury, and ihe second
eleven made several gains around
iiis end on that account. McLaine's
tackling was good, but he did not
break up the interference well.
Cotton played his usual reliable
and hard game. His fault is still
in the poor interference he gives his
fellow backs. Freeman's play was
fair, although he started slowly.
Harrington and Carle went out
early in the game, the former being
replaced by Rice, the "old reliable"
of our football squad. If Rice does
not make the team this year it is
not because he is lacking in wil
lingness. No Stanford player ever
had better record for hard, con
scientious work.
C. Thomas at the other tackle
showed his old fault of cautious
tackling. He does not throw him
self off the ground, but waits to get
close to his man before he tackles
