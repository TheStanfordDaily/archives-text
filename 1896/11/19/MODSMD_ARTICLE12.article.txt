In line with the awakened in- 1
terest in '"things dramatic," as i
shown by the reorganization of!
Swords and Sandals yesterday,!
comes the announcement that that j
organization has been placed in full
control of the entertainment to be |
given for the benefit <>112 the '1)8 An- 1
nual at the beginning of next, se
mester. Thus, after a year of corn- j
parative inactivity, the dramatic
club intends to justify its existence'
by demonstrating to the public that j
it possesses the ability which is i
claimed for it. To say that it is a
move in the right direction is un
necessary. Not only will it result
in this particular entertainment j
being presented in a more careful
and creditable manner, but it also
starts the ball rolling toward secur
ing for the club the control of all
such undertakings at the Univer
sity. One responsible and efficient
management for the theatrical at- j
tempts of the University will result,

in a much higher order of enter- 1
tainments.
