As long as we must have wet
weather during certain portions of
this season, we should 1Â»e thankful
that it has made its appearance
this week and not waited until next;
for now there is a probability that
it will have "rained itself out"' he
fore Thanksgiving day arrives.
Although a soggy field may he con
sidered as an advantage for one
team over another, and the ad
herents of that team may pray for
the powers of nature to assist them
in what they are unable to do with
out it, yet there is nothing so dis
agreeable as to sit uncovered and
unprotected through a football game
in the rain, and try to follow the
course of the play, while at the
same time keeping watch on your
neighbor to prevent the drippings
of his umbrella from trickling down
vonr neck.
