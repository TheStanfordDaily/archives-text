Work will be commenced tomor
row at the Searsville reservoir re
moving the supply pipes, which are
now at the bottom of the dam. to a
higher level, so as to secure a
cleaner supply of water than that
which we now receive. The first
tiling that will be done is to remove
a large quantity of the water in the
reservoir. This can be done only
slowly, and it may lie three weeks
before the work of changing the
pi pep can be commenced. Seven I
experiments were made last year to
clarify the water, but further at
tempts at this are considered use
less so long as the supply pipes re
main at the bottom of the reser
