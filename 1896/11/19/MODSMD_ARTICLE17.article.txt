Editor Daily Palo Aj.to: The
ct'iiter of interest from now until
Thanksgiving will of course lie the
football giiine. The team is hard
iit work and the attendance is good.
There has been some delay in the
matter of football songs, so we have
not yet begun to cheer the boys
with sweet refrains. The team has
been supplied with some gorgeous
blue and gold sweaters and they
make a line appearance. Consider
able difficulty is being experienced
in filling the place of centre-rush;
otherwise the constituency of the
team is pretty certain and is doubt
less known. The sale of tickets for
the game began today at noon and
a great crowd surrounded the ticket
booth nearly all afternoon.
Considerable interest is felt in
the extravaganza to be given on
Thanksgiving night. The sale of
tickets is now going on and the
indications are that there will be a
very large attendance. Five hun
dred tickets were disposed of the
first day of the sale.
The biennial report of the presi
dent has just been issued and shows
a great many interesting things.
A great many changes have taken
place with us during the past two
years and all ot these are given due
attention.
Societies formed for the purpose
of aiding students in their work
are displaying great activity this
year. The only successful organi
zations hitherto have been the
scientific associations and the
Philosophical Union. This year
there have been organized three new
societies —the Political Economy
Club, the Civil Engineering Club,
and the Agricultural Association.
The old societies are showing more
life, too. The Political Economy
Club is now busy with Roger's
Economic Interpretation of History;
the Civil Engineering Club dis
cusses papers prepared by mem
bers of the faculty and persons in
vited to address them; and the
agriculturalists are busy with a
•consideration of the natural re
sources of the State.
The Student's Aid Society is
making itself felt this year. It
lias been able to find positions for
several needy students and is now
arranging a book-exchange where

I students desiring to sell text-books
or buy others at second-hand rat b
may do so. The loan library has:
not proven itself ample enough and
it is thought much benefit will be
derived from the new arrangement.
