# At Congress Springs.
## 
### 
It is now practically settled that
the football team will be taken to
Congress Springs tomorrow to re
main until Thanksgiving day.
The time will be spent in practice
and thf men will have a complete
rest from everything-—save foot
ball. Much attention will be given
to training and diet, and the great
est care taken to get the men in
good form for the game.
The resort at which the team will
stay is eighteen miles south of the
I*Diversity iu the range of foothills
running back of the quadrangle.

The sulphur water analyzes al
most like those at the famous New
York watering-place; from this
fact they have been named the Con
gress Springs, and the little village
a mile or so away is known as
Saratoga. The place is situated in i
a fertile section of flint land near
the orchards which have made the
Santa Clara valley famous. The
region is known as the "warm belt,"
and is much freer from fogs than
Stanford, with somewhat less rain.
The hotel itself —Congress Hall 1
—where the team will have its
headquarters, has rooms for some;
hundreds of guests and is quite a
summer resort, though at this sea
son the athletes will easily take Jirst
place in the social life of the com
munity.
There are several level plots of
ground in the vicinity which could
serve as practice ground and it is
rumored that in case of rain the j
team may be allowed to use an im
mense drier, sometimes used as a
dance hall, whose floor is much
larger than that of Enciua gym.|
and which is lighted by electriciay. i
The management could not have
selected a place better fitted to give
the strength and spirit which shall j
bring victory than this quiet can
yon of Coyote Creek where the sul
phur waters bubble and whose
atmosphere is invigorating and
restful.
Following are the men who will
be taken: Dole, Bigelow, Williams,
Carle, Fickert, Rice, Cotton, Har
rington, Mcintosh, Fisher, James,
1). Thomas, Seawright, So per, Jeffs,
Straight, C. Thomas, Murphy, It.
Smith. Burnett, McLaine, Beckett,
Daley, Robinson, Adams, Freeman,
Parker.
