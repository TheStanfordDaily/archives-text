# Lincoln and Laughter

### 
Everyone whoattends Mr. Frank
Lincoln's entertainment in the
chapel tomorrow evening is sure to
spend an evening of mirth and
laughter. The humor of iMr. Lin
coln is refined, original, and spon
taneous. He has an originality of
conception, which, combined with
his rare ability to seize upon the
grotesque and his keen satirical
powers, makes his performances
always enjoyable. Mr.Lincoln has
the quaint hutnorof Artemus Ward,
in whose steps he is following as
one of the most genuine American
humorists. His powers of facial
expression, his unusual faculties of
imitation, a rich, sonorous voice,
render him especially well qualified
fora public entertainer. Mr. Lin
coln is an accomplished musician,
and he makes frequent use of his
powers in the course of an evening's
entertainment. He never descends
to buffoonery in his monologue; it
consists of pure, legitimate, mirth
creating humor.
The San Francisco Call of Sept.
19 says of an entertainment given
by Mr. Lincoln:
A clever entertainment was given
last night at tlie Association Aud
itorium by Frank Lincoln, the
humorist and mimic. The audience
laughed almost continually at the
whimsical impersonations and
character hits. Sometimes the
mirth became so irrepressible that
Mr. Lincoln had to pause awhile
till it had subsided.
Most of the features in the enter
tainment consisted of imitations of
different characters and types of
humanity. The eniertainer used
no make-up, trusting to his voice
and facial expression to get his ef
fects, though his talent for ventril
oquism helped him in his imper
sonations.
One amusing character sketch
was an imitation of a virtuoso at
the piano, with all the mannerisms
and mane-tossings affected 'by some
long-haired pianists. Another
sketch that aroused roars of laugh
ter was a red-hot address by an
anarchist. Lincoln made the ad
dress in German, and after the ap
plause had subsided congratulated
the audience upon their knowledge
of the language. "1 don't know a
word of German myself," he said,
"it is all by ear that 1 repeat that
address.''
The San Francisco Chronicle of
the same date saj r s:
Everybody laughed all the time
last evening at the Young Men's
Christian Association Auditorium
while Frank Lincoln imitated every
conceivable sort of a thing from
' A Chinese Love Song" to a "Phan
tom Cocktail." • He has stolen
strains from every instilment at
tuned to harmony; no bird or ani
mal has been missed in noting pe
culiarities, and all speakers of every
nationality have been duly recorded
by him for ludicrous reproduction.
No kind or class was slighted.
Young ladies who sing and artists
who play passed in amusing array.
Lincoln plays and sings admirably,
and the interest never lagged in an
entertainment of nearly two hours.
Seats are now on sale at the post
office at twenty-five and fifty cents.
Prices have been placed very low so
that every student may be given

the opportunity of hearing Mr.
Lincoln.
