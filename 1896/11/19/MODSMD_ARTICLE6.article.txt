# The
						Decline of Hazing.
## 
### 
Jt is gratifying to note that
among the college world there is a
very marked decrease in the amount
of hazing which is practiced upon
freshmen. From all over the coun
try data have been gathered which
show very conclusively that the
days of rough hazing it re o\er and
that the practices which formerly
aroused adverse criticism are 110
longer indulged in. And one fea
ture of tliis decline reflects a very
great deal of credit on the students
themselves; it is that the change is
due almost as much to the students
in the colleges as to any efforts on
the part of the faculties to suppress
hazing.
At Harvard and Yale there is
practically no ill feeling whatever
manifested towards the freshmen,
and whatever is done to harass the
new student comes in the way of
practical jokes played upon him
by the upper-classmen. The time
when the freshman at Harvard was
dragged trembling from his bed to
lie doused under the historic col
lege pump, or be tossed in a blanket,
exists now only as a tradition.
"Bloody Monday" is no more.
The rushes at Yale are carried
on so amicably as to bear little re
semblance to the old-time article.
It has been indeed surmised that
the rush of the future will be no
more than a handshaking conven
tion or a meeting to which the stu
dents will go for the purpose of
inquiring as to the health of one
another.
At Princeton, Cornell, Johns
Hopkins, West Point, and Wil
liams mild forms of hazing still en
dure though they are in no way
comparable to the rough pranks
which were wont to be visited upon
the guileless and verdant young
freshman. In 1893 the Princeton
faculty realized its powerlessness to
restrain the growing evil, bo they
appealed to the students themselves.
A mass meeting was held and by a,
formal resolution hazing was abol
ished. Since then the freshmen
have been compelled to run the
gauntlet, but it is done in a harm
less and practically unobjectionable
way. West Point cadets are made
much sport of and are the victims
of many practical jokes, but the
hazing of plebes is carried 011 to a,
much less extent than it was thirty
years ago.
These cases cited show the ten
dency that is making itself felt;
and there is every reason to hope
that with the coming generation
of college men hazing will suffer a
still further decline. It has never
appeared at Stanford in an extreme
form, and probably never will.
Our traditions are not those of the
older college life, and what hazing
has been carried on here has been
much more conservative than that
practiced in other institutions. It
is part of the new era to which we
belong and which they are ap
proaching.
