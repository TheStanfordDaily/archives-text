# ORATORY AND ENTHUSIASM
## At the Football Meeting- Last Night. 
### 
The student body met in the
chapel last evening to ''send off"
the footlml 1 men prior to their de
parture for Congress Springs. It
was a well-attended meeting, and
our lusty "rooters" bellowed for the
team in a way that exceeded all
previous records. There was little
singing, as the new football pam
phlet did not appear in time for the
rally; consequently the musical fea
ture of last year's program was
missing. Then Dr. Jordan was not
present, and he is it host in him
self. Nevertheless the vellers, with
their "concert joshes" and conta
gious enthusiasm, kept things mov
ing, and the rally of '9(> will go
down to history as the most enthu
siastic on record.
President Pomerov opened the
meeting by putting the question of
changing the manner of giving the
veil The proposition to lengthen
out the final "Stanford" was lost
by an overwhelming majority.
Dr. Stillman began the speaking
by a witty it nd enthusiastic address.
He praised the good work of the
football men and urged the student
body to encourage them in every
way possible. "1 find it hard to
speak without trying to point a
moral,.and urge yon to take your
victory, if victory conies, with mod
eration." Dr. Slillman's remarks
were frequent I}' interrupted by ap
plause and laughter.
Mr. Cross next took the floor.
He was received with cheers and
the Yale yell He said in brief:
"Mr. Camp said that last year was
our turn to win and that Berkeley
could have her innings then. Well
we didn't win, so Berkeley's innings
will be deferred another year. This
enthusiasm is good but it should
have come earlier. At Yale the
team knows all the year that the
student body is behind it. Tomor
row when the men leave, each one
of you wants to go to every man
who is a friend or even an acquaint
ance and tell him that you believe
in him and that you are with him.
In conclusion I wish to thank you
one and ail for the uniform kind
ness with which 1 ha ve been treated
here."
Captain Fickert received an ova
tion iis he took the floor: "W hen
'ltd graduated they said that the
last football material had gone out
of college. We propose to show
that there are enough good men in
'97, '9<S, '{Ml, and even in 1900 to
beat U. 0. <is she was never beaten
before."
Manager Brown kept the audi
ence laughing by describing the
troubles caused by his having a
brother in Berkeley. "1 shall be
afraid to go home if we lose," he
siiid. He concluded with the assur
ance that the result of the game
would not keep him from his own
fireside.
Dr. Wood added to the enthu
siasm by a witty speech on the
trials of the official surgeon
This ended the list of regular
speakers. The sophomores on the
back seats, however, kept the meet
ing going by calling up speakers as
the whim took them. Prof. Poiley,
heinu called up by the enthusiastic
Law students said: "1 have oc

casionally missed Mr. Fickert these
warm fall days. On every such
occasion I have looked over to his
vacant seat and imagined 1 saw
the goddess of victory brooding
there. If Fickert comes back
victorious I will be pretty likely to
give him his law credit."
Clemans, '03, went over the list
of Stanford's victories and de
scribed the first football rally in
Encina Hall, when the team was
j going forth to light a forlorn hope.
l'rof. Waiter Miller*related some
of his own football experiences.
Archie Mice, '95, summed up the
strong and weak points of both
teams. He urged the necessity of
[continued and systematic yelling,
and suggested some changes in the
manner of giving the yell.
Switzer, '98, made an appeal on
i behalf of the Hand and asked for
! funds for the purchase of new uni
forms. The suggestion was acted
[ upon by President Pomeroy and
I collectors were appointed to take
contributions at the door.
"I left" Williams, Stuart Cotton,
j A. (J. Kaufman, W. H. Irwin, C. M.
! Bradley, and P>. M. Palmer also
j made short addresses.
At 9:25 this morning twenty
i seven football men together with
Manager Brown and Coachers Cross
i and Clemans left Encina for Con
j gress Springs. The two buses were
j first driven a round the quad. it
! was just at the intermission before
j the 9:80 recitations and it seemed
as though the whole University was
i out to cheer them off. For two or
i three minutes the students rent the
air with Stanford yells and cheers.
Then the two elevens vanished
from the view of the University un
til that breathless moment when
! those red sweaters shall come bowl
ing into the gridiron at Central
Park.
There were no cripples left be
hind, fortunately. It is doubtful
if Dole will be in condition to play
by Thanksgiving, although be went
I with the team. Ki.-her, Seawright
Jeffs, Harrington, and Carle are all
mole or le>s stiff and sore from past
bruises and sprains, which are not,
I however, serious enough to keep
them out of the game. The rest of
the candidates seem to be in prime
| condition.
