The intention expressed by some
of the students of going in com
panies to visit the football team at
the Springs should not be carried
out unless there is some good reason
for making the trip. The members
of the team should be left in quiet
as much as possible the coming
week, with no distraction from now
until the game. The numerous
visitors at Woodside last fall be
came a nuisance. That was the
principal reason for taking the men
farther away this year. The loyal
visitor should save up his enthusi
asm until next Thursday, and he
can give vent to it then to greater
advantage.
