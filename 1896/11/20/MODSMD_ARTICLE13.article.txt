. The impending contest between
the two universities on the foot bull
held should not absorb the attention
of our debaters so fully as to pre
vent them from attending the In
ter-Society Debate tomorrow night.
There is a tendency on tbe part of
some to neglect these meetings be
cause attendance at them is not
compulsory. Those members of
tbe debating societies who miss the
sessions of the League are losing
one of the most favorable oppor
tunities for practice in public speak
ing. It is in these meetings only
that the leading debaters of the
University come together and can
be compared.
