"Last night's practice witnessed
the final game of football on the
campus this year. This morning
| the team left for the Springs, and
j we will now see no more football,
i except as is pictured in our mind's
j eye, until the fateful contest of next
| Thursday afternoon. It will seem
! quiet and uneventful here without
the presence of the men whose play
we have been anxiously watching
| for the past two months, but we
have plenty <>112 enthusiasm, backed
!by our confidence in the team, to
i keep our minds occupied until
j Thanksgiving day. Football in
| terest, far from falling off, will each
| day experience a decided increase,
j and the eve of the great battle will
! find us saturated with enthusiasm
| and excitement over the contest of
the morrow.
