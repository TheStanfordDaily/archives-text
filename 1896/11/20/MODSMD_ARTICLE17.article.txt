# Football in the East.
## 
### 
Two important matches come off
in the East tomorrow, viz.: the
Harvard-Pennsylvania game ;i t
Philadelphia and the Yale-Prince
ton game in New York. One or
both of these contests have for
merly been held Thanksgiving day,
but in the last few years it has
been deemed advisable to change
the date.
As for chances, prophets predict
that Princeton and Pennsylvania
will be the winners. This is based
on comparative scores, on Prince
lon's strength in the kicking game,
and on the crippled condition of
Harvard's team. However, it is an
old saving that "Yale in a hole is
da nge rous."
