# The 						Last Practice.
## 
### 
Both teams were on their mettle
last evening. It was the Varsity's
last appearance on a college grid
iron this year, and the two elevens
went at. it hammer and tongs. The
spectators were yelling in true foot
ball form, and their applause kept
the men going. In spite of the wet
day there was the largest attend
ance of the year, Mrs. Stanford be
ing one of the spectators.
The first team scored twice and
was twice forced back nearly to its
own goal. This rather small score
can be attributed to the excellent
fight of the second eleven rather
than to any weakness of the Var
sity. The men of the scrub team
were "up on their toes," and they
kept the Varsity guessing through
out the practice, Mcintosh, Parker,
and Daley doing particularly good
work. About the middle of the
practice Parker was transferred to
the first eleven, and was very ef
fective in line bucking, hitting hard
and low.
Murphy's kicking was very en
couraging. He sent the ball well
down the field and his punts were
well placed, fie is still somewhat
slow in punting, and the line hits
to hold for an age to let him get in
his kick. His catching was also
accurate. Cotton's line-bucking
was a feature.
The team is working very well
together, probably as well as at the
end of any former season. If the
interference of the backs is not so
good as it has been, the line men
work together better than ever be
fore. The halves have not yet
learned to go into the opposing in
terference its they should —we miss
Frankenheimer back there.
The make-up of the teams is still
a bit of an enigma. The three cen
ter men are solid in their positions,
accidents barred. Harrington itt
tackle and Jeffs at end are likely to
hold those places, as are Murphy at
quarter and Cotton at fullback. If
Fisher's injured leg permits he will
almost certainly play one half; the
other is a toss-up between Dole,
Seawright, and Freeman, with
Parker as a possibility. Straight
and McLaine are having it out at
one end. Straight lnts the advan
tage in weight and in longer train
ing, but is not so swift or so sure
its McLaine. In the same way
1 vice and C. Thomas, two players
of widely different sorts, are light
ing for the other tackle.
