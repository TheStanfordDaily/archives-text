# English College Women
## 
### 
In spite of the obstacles placed
in their way, the women of Eng
land are fast seizing the high places
in educational lines. Upon the
recommendation of her college —
University College, Bristol — a
woman has received a science re
search scholarship from the Royal
Commissioners; and three of the
five scholarships offered by the
London School of Economics and
Political Economy have been se
cured by women, one from Somer
ville Hall, Oxford, and two from
Grislon College, Cambridge.
