# RESTING BEFORE THE CONTEST.
## The 						Team in Retirement at Congress Springs. 
### 
Friday noon there was an ex
pectant host, an empty hotel, and a
full larder in the picturesque sum
mer resort at Congress Springs.
An hour later ihere was a despond
ent host, a full hotel, and a larder
as empty as the bleachers on the
home gridiron. The Stanford foot
ball squad had descended upon the
hotel like thirty ravenous locusts,
a nd mine host has since been spend
ing most of his time scouring the
surrounding country for provisions
to meet the drain.
Congress Springs is in a pictur
esque little canyon far up in the
foothills. The air is clear and
bracing in spite of the wet weather
which has prevailed the past few
days, and the place is eminently
fitted for bringing the athletes into
perfect physical condition. Thick
redwood forests surround the hotel
and there are grape arbors and
viueya rds all around. Into one of
the hitter, nottd for its Sweetwater
grapes, the squad is turned daily,
under the watchful eye of Al Lean,
and permitted to eat sparingly.
The other fruits which grow in
abundance in the surrounding re
gion, as well as the mineral water
which gives the place its name, are
forbidden delicacies to the football
squad.
On Friday and Saturday there
were severe practice games, Satur
day's being the last bard practice
of the season. Sunday's rest was
therefore acceptable to the bruised
and weary athletes. Sunday morn
ing the squad attended the Congre
gational church at Saratoga in a
body. Curiously enough the pas
tor is a Yale man and his name is
Cross.
On Friday afternoon occurred
the first practice in the lumpy
pumpkin-lot which serves as a
field. Murphy and Cotton bad
not yet arrived, and Mcintosh and
Freeman played on the first eleven
Harrington was slightly injured
early in the game. Rice took his
place on the first eleven and played
a star game, his tackling being an
especial feature. Freeman sent
some long and accurate punts. The
last few minutes of the practice was
devoted to testing the Varsity line,
composed that day of Jeffs, Rice,
Fickert, Williams, Carle, Thomas,
and Straight, the forwards who wil 1
at last report face U. C. on 'Thanks
giving day. 'The backs were taken
off the first team and the second
eleven, reinforced by Clemans, was
given the ball and attempted to
score on the Varsity. For about
fifteen minutes the second team
tried all its star plays, but was un
able to cross the goal line of the
first eleven. Straight distinguished
himself by some good tackles.
Burnett and Freeman were very
effective on the second eleven.
There was a long signal practice
and some special work in passing
and kicking Saturday morning In
the afternoon occurred the last, hard
practice of the season. The time
was mostly taken up in trying new
plays, the first and second elevens
both using these plays. 'Thesecond
eleven scored once on the Varsity.
'The team will not, however, depend

much on tricks, as the coaches be
lieve in sharp playing and straight
football.
Rice again played a cyclonic
game at tackle. Burnett was
moved to tackle on the second
eleven where he did some fierce,
strong work, lie is, according to
indications, one of our coining
Varsity men. Straight was the
best of the end men.
The men have been eating, sleep
ing, and living football. A few
have tried to study evenings and
odd times, but the anxiety of the
coming game has kept the thoughts
of most of the men to the all-pre
vailing topic. Al Lean has proven
a very efficient trainer. Besides
being a master of the rubber's art,
he thoroughly understands the
diet and care of training athletes,
and takes a pride in bringing the
men into good condition.
There have been a few jokes to
enliven proceedings. On Friday
Murphy the Oregonian saw a buck
eye tree for the first time and called
the men out to "look at the tigs."
When Cross appeared in the dining
room on Sunday he found a. high
chair and bib at his place at the
training table.
Clemans left today in order to
fulfill his important engagement on
Wednesday. Harrelson, Code, and
Walton went up to the Springs yes
terday to remain until the end.
Following was the line-up.
