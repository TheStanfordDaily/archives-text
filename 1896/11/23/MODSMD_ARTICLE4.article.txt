# Thanksgiving Service.
## 
### 
The Thanksgiving service in the
chapel Sunday morning was con
ducted by Prof. Show, who read
the Scripture and offered prayer.
Before the address Prof. Goebel
rendered an organ voluntary and
Dr. and Miss Little and Mrs. .Jaggar
sang solos. At the close Mrs. A.
W. Smith, accompanied on the vio
lin by Mrs. Brown, sang a solo
which was followed by a solo ren
dered by P. Abbott. Prof. A. T.
Murray then delivered the follow
ing address:
Doubtless there is no one of us
here who in looking back over the
past year can not heartily give
thanks. When one thinks of the
futility of so much of human ef
fort and the many vicissitudes of
life, to have been brought through
the year in health and comfort and
such outward prosperity as may
have been ours is indeed enough to
cause a feeling of deep gratitude
and thankfulness.
Yet this Thanksgiving season
never comes but it finds some to
whom the President's proclamation
reads like a grim parody—some to
whom the year past has brought
nothing hut suffering, business ad
versity, baffled hopes, the loss of
loved ones. How shall one then
speak for another? It is hard in
deed for these to look up out of
their sorrow and say "Father, I
thank thee" And how shall we,
meeting here amid surroundings
that we love, among those who are
dear to us, spending our lives as we
do, where there is much to brighten,
and cheer, and stimulate us, how
shall we speak for those whose
hearts are heavy, and bid them give
thanks with us?
And vet we may. We may look
away from the outward circum
stances of life to the deeper truths
that underlie the lives of all of us
and heartily thank God that the
experiences of these months past
have made us stronger and better
men and women. Prosperity or ad
versity, joy of sorrow, riches or pov
erty, what matter these in the
deeper sense, so we be men? And
if in the counsels of the Almighty
we have been called upon to pass
through deep waters, have we not
come out with hearts quicker to
feel for others, stronger to bear,
more fit for service?
If we have grown ii is well with
us. and from full hearts we may
thank God for this ability to grow;
to reap from the fields of joy or sor
row good grain of kindly thoughts
and deeds; to transform by the
magic of God's chemistry outward
circumstances of good or ill into en
during fortes, into character.
Who is there who can under
stand or fathom the mystery of
God's will? Why has it pleased
Him that comfort and perhaps
prosperity should be ours, while
many another is struggling against
poverty and disease? We know
not, and God forbid that in our
Thanksgiving there be any touch
of selfishness. Let us thank Him
for health and strength and happi
ness, but we know well that these
things may not be ours tomorrow.
Let us take them as gifts from our
Father's hand, and use them in all
lowliness of mind, as good stew
ards of the manifold grace of God.

i For does not our deepest joy come
from service? Our human hearts
are quick to respond to outward
circumstances, to feel keenly the
joy or the sorrow they bring. We
do not live, most of us, on a
level from which we can contem
plate these things calmly. Yet
of iill that enters into our lives
is not the sense of fellowship, of
love, and sympathy the very high
est? How glad we are to tell one
j we love of our joys, our hopes! How
iwe lean on him in our sorrows!
| And in life's great crises when
| words are so poor, how we feel the
j grasp of the hand that tells so in
finitely much!
Yes, thank God for this fellow
ship. We are not all strong in all
j things; we crave help and sym
pathy, and in our friends we tind
| it.
And this close union with one
another is more than this. Here,
| too, it is more blessed to give than
|to receive. Happy are we if in
I these months we have been en
j abled to help another; happy if
others have had cause to be glad
! that we are here. For our lives
I may indeed be, in the truest sense,
! gospel messages—to preach good
| tidings, to bind up the broken
! hearted
These tilings, thank God, are all
but independent of circumstance or
! place. None are so burdened but
they may lighten another's burden;
none so downcast but there may
yet be those who will call them
blessed; none so far from their
Father's bouse but they may yet
hear the words, "Inasmuch as ye
did it unto one of the least of these
my brethren, ye have done it unto
me.'"'
And let us also thank God for
such measure <>112 spiritual insight
ias may be ours, llere no man may
| judge another or speak for another;
I but if in the paths of the world,
i amid the restless strife and change
I that is going on about us, we have
been able to look up out of the
darkness to the Father of light
with whom is no variableness
neither shadow of burning —shall
we not therefore render Him
thanks?
Who are we that the Eternal
should think of us? Who are we
that we dare to pray to Him? And
yet in our human weakness when
all about seems dark, have we not
stretched forth our hands in prayer?
I And has not prayer lifted us up,
] brought us near to God? "'Fear thou
j not, for I am with thee; be not dis
mayed, for 1 am thy God." The
prophet of old spake those words
as from Jehovah; and he feared not
| to go farther and declare that when
He who was to come should appear
I His name should be called Em
manuel, God with us. And for
J well nigh twenty centuries men
have known what it is to walk with
• God.
Ah, may we not thank Him for
| the sure faith that all is well,
; whether we walk in the light or in
the dark? Thank Ilim that in all
! ages there have lived those who
endured as seeing lliin who is in
| visible; thank Him that around
our tiniteness lies Mis infinite pow
er; that the Eternal God is our
refuge, and underneath are the
everlasting arms.
