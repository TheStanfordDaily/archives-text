It is to be noted that very few
students spent Sunday by going up
to the camp at Congress Springs.
Every year at Woodside the teams
and coach have been annoyed by
the prying and questions of par
ticular friends of the players.
This has always been a source of
great aggravation and the move to
the new quarters is a great improve
ment if it has done away with this
nuisance.
