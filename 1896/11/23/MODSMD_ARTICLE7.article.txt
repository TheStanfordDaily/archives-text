Now that the football men have
gone and there is no practice to see,
we have a good opportunity to
practice our songs and yells. It
has always been too apparent at
the games that we have had no
concert practice in singing and very
little in veiling. There are few who
can sing our best or oldest songs
through without an embarrassing
break-down. Even the popular
choruses are not as familiar to us
as they ought to be. Such a st;Ue
of things should not be allowed.
Every Stanford man and woman
should make it a point to learn as
well as possible the songs contained
in the new book, at least well
enough to sing the words with
those who are able to lead the airs.
It has long been a cause for com
plaint that we had no football
songs. The fact is, we have too
many, and do not know or attempt
to learn them. The singing of the
songs at the last rally of last year
was a signal failure for this very
reason.
It is to be hoped that every stu
dent will turn out to the last rally
in the gymnasium Wednesday even
ing prepared to follow the leaders
through the songs. There was no
concerted action last year for the
want of a leader, but the committees
this year give assurance of provid
ing good leaders of the songs and
yells. This one practice if properly
carried out should accustom us to
the songs well enough to enable us
to sing them with some effect on
Thanksgiving. With the possible
exception of one chorus we have
never been able to sing our Varsity
songs at the game. With proper!
practice we should be able to sing |
through the drowning-out process |
which U. C. has heretofore applied
with such great success, and is sure!
to repeat.
