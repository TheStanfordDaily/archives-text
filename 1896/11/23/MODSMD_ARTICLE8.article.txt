# The 						Thanksgiving "Sequoia."
## 
### 
The Thanksgiving number of the
Sequoia will he out tomorrow. It
will contain a half-tone picture of
the freshman football team, two
full-page cartoons printed in colors,
and a group of the principal build
ings of the University. There will
also he four additional pages of
reading matter.
In this number the continued
story by Dane Coolidge begins, it
is entitled "The Conscious Freak of
Ralph Jerome," and it depicts a
unique phase of life at Stanford.
Mr. Coolidge is a writer of recog
nized ability, and this story shows
no diminution of power. The
colloquial note predominates ,and it
is given with true felicity. Ralph
Jerome is a wholly fictitious char
acter, but the originals of several
of the other characters are not far
to seek.
Hugh Sanglier — which is the
novte de plume of :> 11 upper-class
man —also contributes a story to
this number. "The Tryst under
the Linden" is a little romance of
mediaeval times that is told with a
notable charm of style.
Carolus Ager has an amusing
critique of his own burlesque, "The
Macbeths of Berkeley,'' which is to
be performed Thanksgiving night.
Then there are two sonnets on
the quadrangle by E. M. 1 Inline,
and a poem, "Lift up Thv Head,"
by Irving Outcalt, which is prob
ably the best that writer has yet
written.
The book reviews are by Prof
Ross and E M. Hulme. The illus
trations are by Merle .Johnson.
