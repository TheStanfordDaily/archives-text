# Frank Lincoln's Entertainment.
## 
### 
A good-sized audience greeted
Frank Lincoln in the chapel Fri
day night on the occasion of his
first appearance at the University.
Mr. Lincoln is an ideal entertainer
and fully sustained by bis efforts
the high reputation which lie lias
earned for himself the world over.
The audience, which was an appre
ciative one, was kept in a continual
burst of laughter from the com
mencement to the close.
Mr. Lincoln does not follow a
regular set program in his enter
tainments but amuses his audience
with a constant succession of witty
jokes and sparkling sayings, with
little regard paid to order or form.
As he himself said in his opening
remarks, his entertainment dealt
entirely with the ludicrous things
of life.
In his powers of mimicry and
imitation Mr. Lincoln was certainly
at his best Friday evening, for the
humorous and ridiculous situations
into which he led his audience were
.simply irresistible. Perhaps the
most popular production of the
evening was his laughable illustra
tion of the way in which a young
benedict responded to a toast to
"friends, relatives, and his mother
in-law" at a wedding banquet. An
other production which met with
much favor was the difficult but
surprisingly excellent imitation of,
an orchestra in full play.
11 is descriptions and ill list rations
of the different styles of music, from
the simple German ballad to the
high Italian opera, were also ad
mirable, and provoked unceasing
laughter. In fact the whole enter-j
tain men t was of a very high order
of excellence, the versatility and
ability of the author affording an I
evening of undisguised fun.
Mr. Lincoln is at present engaged
upon his second professional tour!
of the world, and should he ever
have occasion to revisit the Uni-|
versity he will meet with an enthu
siastic reception.
