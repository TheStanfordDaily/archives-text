Editor Daily Palo Alto: The
last practice game of football was
played this morning on the lower
campus. The football ground was
so muddy that it could not he used
and the boys exercised themselves
in the buffalo grass of the slope.
Quite a crowd of students was
present, and considerable enthusi
asm was shown.
Roger S. Phelps' "Football Bong"
was awarded the prize by the com
mittee and will be issued next week
with* several other songs. The col
lection this year is slightly larger
than that of last year.
The prospects of the theater party
for Thanksgiving night are very
bright. The extravaganza was
written by l)e Witt Gray and will
be entirely an effort of the students.
It consists of three acts; its time,
Ihe future; place, an island in the
land of Nod called Kokapo. It is
concerned with the attempts of a
feminine agitator to establish a rule
free from the tyranny of the op
pressor, man. The course of the
plot may be learned only by wit
nessing the play, but we are told
that in the last act the queen her
self succumbs to the wooing of a
football hero.
The music for the choruses and
solos has been selected from some
of the latest comic operas. The
jokes are up to date and the cos
tumes are the most gorgeous and
beautiful ever seen in our univer
sity plays
The {Student's Congress met last
Wednesday night and discussed
the burning question "Should com
pulsory military drill in the uni
versity be abolished?" The debate
was won by the negative although
by a very small majority.
A meeting of the botanical sec
tion of the Science Association was
held last night in South Hall.
The subject discussed was "Vege
tation on alkaline soils." The
next meeting of the Science Asso
ciation will be given over to the
geological section.
Dr. Payne, the university physi
cian, whose serious accident on our
grounds was noted some time ago,
is slowly improving, and hopes are
now entertained that he will re
cover.
A Chrysanthemum Supper will
be served in Stiles Hall next Tues
day by the Young Women's Chris
tian Association. Other than this,
there will be nothing given in the
line of entertainment during the
next week; all interest is centered
on the football game.
