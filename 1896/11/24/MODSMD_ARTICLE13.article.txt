The plan which some of the
fraternities ancl other organizations
of Berkeley, as announced in the
San Francisco papers, intend to
follow at the football game of
occupying boxes and reserved sec
tions by themselves, while a good
one in many respect?, is yet some
what unfortunate from a "yelling"
standpoint. To do good hard
effective veiling all the voices should
be in one compact body, so that the
sounds can roll forth in one pon
derous whole. Having college ad
herents scattered all over the
groundsill small bands, each giv
ing its comparatively feeble yell at
different times, has the effect of
greatly weakening the force that
can be produced only by combined
numbers, and it augurs well for
Stanford yelling at the game that
none of our adherents are so
scattered. The effect of what a
small body of "rooters" can do was
demonstrated at the recent Berke
ley-Stanford Freshman game.
