The sale of tickets for the Vaude
ville show goes slowly on. Berkeley
has sold up to date over thirteen
hundred dollars worth of tickets
for her entertainment, a sum greatly
in excess of the amount so far
realized by us, but the manage
ment of our interests are experienc
ing little worry on this account for
they realize what effect victory in
the afternoon will have in filling
the California Theatre to overflow
ing in the evening. Yet more
interest should be displayed among
the students. The advance sale
has not yet approached by far that
of last year. The student body
management has gone to con
siderable expense to make the
entertainment a success and the
enterprise certainly deserves better
financial support. There is more
competition to be met this year,
and in addition Berkeley is giving
a burlesque.
Even should the cardinal meet
defeat we owe it to our musical and
dramatic talent to encourage their
efforts by our presence. Plenty of
desirable seats yet remain, and they
will be on sale on the special train
and in the city Thanksgiving morn
ing. Everyone who desires to at
tend should purchase their seats

before the game, as there will be u
great rush after the victory which
we all hope to win.
