### 
The two athletic club elevens
played off their tie game of the
14th at Central Park last Saturday,
resulting in a victory for Olympic
bv the score of (5-0. About 3000
people saw the game.
The Olympics showed a decided
superiority over the men across the
bay from the first kick off until the
last down. Reliance played a
desperate defensive game all the
time, not being able to advance the
ball against the strong lineopposed
to them. The game in many re
spects looked more like football
than that of the week before.
Three of the Oaklanders were
severely injured in the second half,
Carter, Arlitt, and Lacuna. This
greatly weakened the team, but. the
rest of the men in the game and
more especially Walton and Oliver
played like fiends to keep the score
ironi being larger. The best work
for Olympic was done by Tommy
Code, Snowden, and Pete Smith.
Their team work was very good,
the interference being compact and
fast. The men of the "winged O"
were highly elated over the victory.
Captain Smith was carried from
the field on the shoulders of the
jubilant club-men in regular col
lege style.
