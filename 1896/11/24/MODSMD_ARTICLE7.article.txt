j met.
The executive committee of the
Chapel Union have now decided to
! formulate a larger plan.
The Hymnal now in usecontains
many tunes and hymns that are
; precious and worshipful. It is be
lieved, however, that the service of
i song can be made more helpful and
inspiring to all if the present Hym

! with words and music more adapted
I to our University service.
The music committee have rec
lommended the "University Hym
nal." prepared for the use of Har
j vard University, as such a book.

J the publishers specially bound and
; stamped with the Stanford name
for $1.00 per copy, if a large num
ber is ordered.

mends the purchase of 200 copies of
' this Hymnal for use in the chapel;
! and this circular is sent out in or
i der to ascertain if such purchase
will be authorized by you.
