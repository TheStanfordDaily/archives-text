# AN INTERVIEW WITH CROSS.
## Mr. Cross Discusses the Team and Its Prospects. 
### 
Coach Cross returned to the Uni
versity I his afternoon and was seen
liy 11 Daily Palo Alto representa
tive. Mr. Cross was busily engaged
in packing for his departure, but
spared a few minutes to the team
;i nd its chances.
Mr. Cross confirmed the report of
the make-lip of the team as pub
lished in the Daily Palo Alto.
" Liice was placed at tackle and
Straight at end," said Mr. Cross,
"as that seemed the best thingtodo.
liice has played a steady, consist
ent game, was experienced in the
position, was the next best man af
ter Harrington was injured, and
deserved the position. Straight's
play fell off for awhile, but after
his lay-off he played a good game,
showing that he was simply stale."
In regard to the physical condi
tion of the team Mr. Cross stated
that every man seemed to be in fine
condition for two hard halves, and
that he was confident the men pos
sessed the necessary endurance and
wind for the struggle tomorrow.
Jeff's ankle is still a little weak,
but both ends get down on kicks
very well. Thomas is playing a
steady game at tackle. Fisher -is
all right. Murphy is wonderfully
improved physically.
''Williams is blaying bis usual
game and 1 expect to see him play
better than ever tomorrow." Carle
is in good condition for the game,
and Captain Fickert is not allowing
his responsibility to weigh too
heavily upon him. In fact Mr.
Cross had nothing to complain ot
in regard to the physical condition
of the men. He was very well
pleased with Congress "Springs, and
the accommodations surpassed his
expectations.
In regard to interference and
team work Mr. Cross said that the
team played together more as a
unit than before. "Berkeley will
play the faster game, and a heavy
field will therefore be slightly in
favor of Stanford as the Berkeley
backs will not be able to play so
fast. Stanford will rely upon
straight football to win, placing
little reliance on trick plays The
style of play will depend on the
strength of the Berkeley team.
Murphy has been punting very
well, and Stanford will not lose
much in a kicking game. Cotton is
also playing a good game.
As to our chances of winning
Mr Cross would not hazard a
guess, but merely said that the
team would play for all that was
in them, that they were in good
condition, that every man was
playing a steady game, and that in
his opinion the team would make a
good showing.
In case any substitute is needed
Mr. Cross stated that James was
first sub-tackle, Burnett first for
center and guard, Smith first, for
end, Dole, Parker, and Thomas, in
the order named, for backs, and
Freeman and Mcintosh, sub-full
and sub-quarter respectively.
Mr. Cross left Congress Springs
this morning and left the Univer
sity on the 5:48 train for San Jose,
where the team will arrive by bus
from the Springs at B o'clock. The
team and coaches leave for the city
tomorrow on the flyer, and will
stop at the Pleasanton Hotel. Mr.
Cross made a very earnest request
that no student call on the team
while at the hotel, and lie also re
quested that no student visit the
teanj during the intermission at the
big game. Mr. Cross wishes this
time for the coaches with the team.
