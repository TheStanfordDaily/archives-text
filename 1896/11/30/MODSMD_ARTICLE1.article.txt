Stanford's victory over U. 0. on
Thanksgiving day was the most
decisive in the history of inter
collegiate football <>ii the Pacific
Coast.
It is most remarkable when it is
considered in comparison with the
games of former years between the
two great universities of the West.
1 leretofore the games have been so
close as to leave the result in doubt
to the very end, but in this last
game there was left no doubt of the
cardinal-clad men over their rivals
in the striped jerseys. The best
team won and won handily; not,
however, without a struggle, for
every inch of ground hail to be
earned at the cost of an enormous
amount of energy. It was a vic
tory of individual strength, endur
ance, and skill, coupled with almost
perfect team work, over a team
stronger at some points in individ
ual ability, but lacking, to a great
extent, that indispensable unity of
action which often wins a game
against odds. The Stanford men
seemed to have their hearts in their
work; the Berkeley players ap
peared to be performing a disagree
able duty.
Stanford handled the ball in a
masterly manner and few were the
fumbles and muffs recorded against
the men from I'alo Alto. On the
other hand Berkeley's play was
marred throughout by repeated
fumbles and failure to catch a
punted ball.
The most praiseworthy feature of
Stanford's game was its remarkable
lack of fouling and off-side play.
The crowd began to arrive at
Central Park as early as 12 o'clock
and by 2 o'clock the "rooters' " sec
tions of the universities were tilled,
and crowds surrounded Ihe several
entrances, crowding and jostling in
their anxiety to reach the scene of
the coming strife. By 2" 1 o the
seats on the sides of the field were
a mass of college colors, while the
inclined platform on the west side
<>112 the gridiron was crowded with
enthusiasts who wished to be near
the side-lines.
The blue and gold seemed to pre
dominate in thi!-£ vast mass of
people. And in looking about from
a central point the thought struck
one of the great odds in numbers
Stanford had to face. But any
fear of disaster on this account was
quickly dispelled at the thought of
the enthusiastic alumni who had
come miles to support the cardinal,
with all the energy so characteristic
of 'Do and '9ti and the classes that
went before. The feeling of confi
dence was further strengthened
when at 2:1 S, amid deafening
cheers, the cardinal-clad Band
marched through the gates to add
melody and strength to the Stan
ford cheers, and to put to shame
the blue and gold musicians.

The interval before the entrance
of the teams was tilled in with
songs, yells, and good-natured josh
ing. Berkeley had another dimin
utive hear and a canvas-clad youth
of similar proportions as mascot.
These, together with a small "bow
wow' - whose tail had been orna
mented with a can and ribbons,
constituted the comedy element in
the prelude to Berkeley's tragedy.
At '2:87 Captain Kicked and his

men leaped over the low fence and
trotted briskly to the center of the
field. Then Bounded (lie most pop
ular yell of the day—"( Jive 'Km
the Ax." Thin din had hardly
died away when Berkeley took her
i lllli 11ir at welcoming her knights of
the gridiron, clad in stripes.
After a few moments of signal
practice the teams lined up for the
kick-off. Stanford luid the north
goal and U. (J. the kick-off.

Time was called at 2:45. Cap
tain liansome kicked the ball to
Stanford's twenty-tive-yard line,
where Seawright caught it and ran
it in eleven yards. - Fisher and Sea
wiight were then sent through for
five yards each. Murphy punted,
liansome caught the ball, and
Fickert downed him. Berkeley's
attempts to gain were ineffectual
and Stanford again had possession
of the ball. Then began the on-

slaught that was typical of Stan
ford's pi ay throughout. Without
losing the hall, Fisher, Senwright,
and Cotton carried it in turn down
the field from the fifty-yard line to
the end and over, at 2:. r >f), just ten
minutes from the time of the kick
off. Murphy missed the goal.
Score: 4 to 0.
Scarcely hstd the crowd realized
that Stanford had scored, when
.Johnny Ilice was seen hugging the

ball behind Berkeley's goal-line.
Ran&ome had kicked off, Murphy
had returned the kick, Berkeley
had fumbled to Stanford, Murphy
had punted again, and Straight
had tackled Ransome so hard that
the ball flew from the U.C. cap
tain's hands into those of Johnny
Rice, who was just where he was
needed. Murphy kicked the goal.
Score: Stanford 10, U. C. 0.
The remaining touch-downs and
j goal were made in the second half.
! Murphy made the first touch-down
after a run of seventeen yards by
quarterback run on the third down,
seven yards to gain. No goal.
The last touch-down was made
by Cotton through the center from
i the one-yard line immediately after
he had made a gain of eleven yards
by squirming and being dragged
j sled-iashion by Fickert. Murphy
1 kicked the goal. Score: 20-0.
It is difficult to single out a sin
gle man for brilliant play from
eleven who did star work, but un
doubtedly Cotton's work was the
best of the day. He was given the
I ball are n arkable number of times
and seldc m failed to giiin. lie was

Stanford's victory over U. 0. on
Thanksgiving day was the most
decisive in the history of inter
collegiate football <>ii the Pacific
Coast.
It is most remarkable when it is
considered in comparison with the
games of former years between the
two great universities of the West.
1 leretofore the games have been so
close as to leave the result in doubt
to the very end, but in this last
game there was left no doubt of the
cardinal-clad men over their rivals
in the striped jerseys. The best
team won and won handily; not,
however, without a struggle, for
every inch of ground hail to be
earned at the cost of an enormous
amount of energy. It was a vic
tory of individual strength, endur
ance, and skill, coupled with almost
perfect team work, over a team
stronger at some points in individ
ual ability, but lacking, to a great
extent, that indispensable unity of
action which often wins a game
against odds. The Stanford men
seemed to have their hearts in their
work; the Berkeley players ap
peared to be performing a disagree
able duty.
Stanford handled the ball in a
masterly manner and few were the
fumbles and muffs recorded against
the men from I'alo Alto. On the
other hand Berkeley's play was
marred throughout by repeated
fumbles and failure to catch a
punted ball.
The most praiseworthy feature of
Stanford's game was its remarkable
lack of fouling and off-side play.
The crowd began to arrive at
Central Park as early as 12 o'clock
and by 2 o'clock the "rooters' " sec
tions of the universities were tilled,
and crowds surrounded Ihe several
entrances, crowding and jostling in
their anxiety to reach the scene of
the coming strife. By 2" 1 o the
seats on the sides of the field were
a mass of college colors, while the
inclined platform on the west side
<>112 the gridiron was crowded with
enthusiasts who wished to be near
the side-lines.
The blue and gold seemed to pre
dominate in thi!-£ vast mass of
people. And in looking about from
a central point the thought struck
one of the great odds in numbers
Stanford had to face. But any
fear of disaster on this account was
quickly dispelled at the thought of
the enthusiastic alumni who had
come miles to support the cardinal,
with all the energy so characteristic
of 'Do and '9ti and the classes that
went before. The feeling of confi
dence was further strengthened
when at 2:1 S, amid deafening
cheers, the cardinal-clad Band
marched through the gates to add
melody and strength to the Stan
ford cheers, and to put to shame
the blue and gold musicians.

The interval before the entrance
of the teams was tilled in with
songs, yells, and good-natured josh
ing. Berkeley had another dimin
utive hear and a canvas-clad youth
of similar proportions as mascot.
These, together with a small "bow
wow' - whose tail had been orna
mented with a can and ribbons,
constituted the comedy element in
the prelude to Berkeley's tragedy.
At '2:87 Captain Kicked and his

men leaped over the low fence and
trotted briskly to the center of the
field. Then Bounded (lie most pop
ular yell of the day—"( Jive 'Km
the Ax." Thin din had hardly
died away when Berkeley took her
i lllli 11ir at welcoming her knights of
the gridiron, clad in stripes.
After a few moments of signal
practice the teams lined up for the
kick-off. Stanford luid the north
goal and U. (J. the kick-off.

Time was called at 2:45. Cap
tain liansome kicked the ball to
Stanford's twenty-tive-yard line,
where Seawright caught it and ran
it in eleven yards. - Fisher and Sea
wiight were then sent through for
five yards each. Murphy punted,
liansome caught the ball, and
Fickert downed him. Berkeley's
attempts to gain were ineffectual
and Stanford again had possession
of the ball. Then began the on-

slaught that was typical of Stan
ford's pi ay throughout. Without
losing the hall, Fisher, Senwright,
and Cotton carried it in turn down
the field from the fifty-yard line to
the end and over, at 2:. r >f), just ten
minutes from the time of the kick
off. Murphy missed the goal.
Score: 4 to 0.
Scarcely hstd the crowd realized
that Stanford had scored, when
.Johnny Ilice was seen hugging the

ball behind Berkeley's goal-line.
Ran&ome had kicked off, Murphy
had returned the kick, Berkeley
had fumbled to Stanford, Murphy
had punted again, and Straight
had tackled Ransome so hard that
the ball flew from the U.C. cap
tain's hands into those of Johnny
Rice, who was just where he was
needed. Murphy kicked the goal.
Score: Stanford 10, U. C. 0.
The remaining touch-downs and
j goal were made in the second half.
! Murphy made the first touch-down
after a run of seventeen yards by
quarterback run on the third down,
seven yards to gain. No goal.
The last touch-down was made
by Cotton through the center from
i the one-yard line immediately after
he had made a gain of eleven yards
by squirming and being dragged
j sled-iashion by Fickert. Murphy
1 kicked the goal. Score: 20-0.
It is difficult to single out a sin
gle man for brilliant play from
eleven who did star work, but un
doubtedly Cotton's work was the
best of the day. He was given the
I ball are n arkable number of times
and seldc m failed to giiin. lie was
aided greatly by the powerful cen
■ ter trio, Fickert, Williams, and
; Carle, whose work, both aggressive
and defensive, was without a fault.
