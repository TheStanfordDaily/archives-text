Tuk Hand this year was without
doubt the best ever turned out by
the Varsity. Too much credit can
not be given to the men themselves
and to the very efficient manage
ment for the part they took in win
ning the great victory. The Hand
is essentially a part of the great
game, and the men who spend a
great deal of time and effort to per
fect their part of the Thanksgiving
day program should not be forgot
ten in the hour of rejoicing.
A proper incentive should be
given by the Student Body to make
the Hand better every year. No
support should be denied them
when it is possible to give it. In
this connection it might be well to
speak of the small indebtedness
which was incurred in the rent of
uniforms. The manager advanced
the necessary money to get the uni
forms, depending upon the Exec
utive Committee to reimburse him.
To show a proper appreciation of
the Hand the committee should
not hesitate to satisfy this debt.
The uniforms of cardinal mortar
boards and gowns were one of the
finest features of the day, and at
tracted a great deal of compli
mentry notice.

Once more we have met our
friends across the bay on the grid
iron and come away the victors.
The defeat was overwhelming, the
victory complete and decisive. The
game was never in douht from the
first downs until the cardinal's
eleven heroes were carried from the
field on the shoulders of their en
thusiastic admirers. We had won,
after five years of doubtful and
close games, a victory that was a
victory.
'"Honor to whom honor is due.''
It is probable that this year's lean),
as individuals, was little better
than some teams of previous years
—than the '98 team for example.
The thing that sent those wedges
four times over the goul line was,
in the language of an upperclass
mau, "The spirit of Charlie Fickert
and Harry Uross knocked into that
team." It was this spirit of deter
mination, the spirit that wins
games, which, more than the
strength of our line or of our team
work, brought about that victory.
The Daily Palo Alto takes this
occasion for thanking, on behalf of
the student body, both these men;
our loyal captain, for three years
our''old reliable,'' and the gentle
manly athlete from mother Yale
who has done so much to make
Stanford's game not only a win
ning but a clean one.
