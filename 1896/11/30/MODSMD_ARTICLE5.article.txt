# THANKSGIVING VAUDEVILLE.
## A 						Large Crowd at the California Theater. 
### 
The California Theater on Thurs
day night was the scene of gay and
noisy enthusiasm, the occasion
being the annual Thanksgiving!
vaudeville show given by students j
of this University. If there had I
previously existed any doubts as to
the financial outcome of the under- j
taking, all fears were effectually |
dispelled the minute the result oi j
the great game in the afternoon be- |
came known. Many who had be-|
fore hesitated rushed to the box-office ;
at the theater to obtain se:its fiir
the evening, and from five o'clock i
umil alter eight there was one con-;
tinual throng of purchasers.
Shortly beiore 8:80 o'clock, when j
the curtain was rung up, every ]
available seat in the house was oe-i
cupied, as well as the spaces in the
aisles and back of the parquet, I
where standing room was at a !
premium. The entrance of the
tootball team and (loach Cross I
about this time was the signal for j
great applause by the audience,
which had evidently been h>ervingj
its luug power for this occasion. I
The team occupied the two lower i
boxes on the right hand side of the I
house, and its members were objects
oi interest the entire evening.
The opening number on tne pro
gram was a song, ''The Staniord
.March," by the I«lee Club. Jl was
rendered in a most excellent man
ner, and the club was obliged to i
respond to a hearty encore. The j
skirt dances by C. 1 Dillon and
W. M. Mackintosh were exceed
ingly clever productions, that of
the latter being made especially
pleasing by the brilliant play of
many-colored calcium lights upon j
the gracefully waving folds of ihej
costume. Tne rendition of the j
■'Handicap March ' by the Mando
lin Clul) was well received and |
warm ly encored, as indeed was their ,
second production. C. I. Dillon and
1 1. P. Ha Id win in their re present at ion
of "The Tramps ' were amusing, and
tiieirsongof things Berkeley and
Stanford was clever, although iti
would have been much better not j
to have read the last verses from :
slips of paper The second num
ber of the Glee Club was as credit- !
ably rendered as the first and re-|
c ivtd an emphatic encore. A
ballet, participated in by eight i
coryphees and a premiere da n.-cu.-e. i
wat» the closing number of the lirst j
part of the program. The dancers i
were very tastefully and artistically
costumed and the steps were well
taken, but the performance suffered |
ironi lack of practice.
The intermission between the
lirst and second parts was em-1
ployed by the audience in giving!
the college yells, chorus jokes, and j
a good time generally. Mr. Cross j
and Captain Fickert were called!
upon for speeches and both re-:
<ponded in a brief but neat manner, j
Se vera 1 other meni hers of the footba II ;
team were urged to display their
-peaking abilities but bashfully |
deeli ned.
The entire second-half of the pro- j
gram was taken up by the bur
lesque '"The Macbeths of Berkeley"
written by C. K. Field,'9s. It was a
very creditable piece of work and!
contained many clever hits on
Berkeley, some of them however!
being somewhat strained and far- j
•fetched. The general character of
the pl iy is a little bit heavy for j
«ueh adaptation. The best acting
was done by F. B. Riley, and C. K.
Field. They bad difficult parts to
take and sustained them with
credit. All however showed more
or less unfamiliarity with their

lilies, and it was these enibaraesing
pauses, which robbed t lie pro
duction of much of its effect. In
fact that was a general criticism
passed upon the entire program —a
lack of practice shown by the
participants' unfamiliarity with
their 'Mines."
On the whole, the entertainment
was very satisfactory, although not
as good as has been, or rtally can
be, presented by University talent.
It was marred by the unncessary
and tiresome waits between num
bers and by the lack of thorough
familiarity with the parts. How
ever, the former objection may be
excused on Hie ground that it is
the usual accompaniment of ama
teur performances, while the fact
that the presentation of the enter
tainment was in a generally mixed
and muddled state, until shortly
before Thanksgiving, may account
for the latter contingencv.
