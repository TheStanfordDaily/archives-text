# Band Concert at the Palace.
## 
### 
The University Banc! gave m con
cert in the court of the Palace
Hotel on Thanksgiving morning.
The court was crowded and the
railings far above were lined with
the guests of the hotel, who listened
with pleasure to the music dis
coursed, and joined heartily in the
applause which followed each
rendition. The scene in the court
was a very lively one, with a large
crowd of Stanford men singing the
Varsity songs as the Hand played
them and giving the yell. The
men appeared here for the first
time in their new uniforms. The
cardinal hank in the inarlde court
made a very beautiful and impos
ing scene. Four numbers were
rendered: "Right Tackle," "Stan
ford University March," "Tenth
Regiment." and "Rush the Rail
Along."
