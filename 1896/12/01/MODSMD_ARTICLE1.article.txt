# The
						Championship
## 
### 
There is ;i misunderstanding in
the city about the championship of
the Pacific Coast big four; Berkeley,
Olympic, Reliance, and Stanford.
At the beginning of the year an
agreement was made that Berkeley
should play two games with Reli
ance and one with Olympic and
t.hat Stanford was to play two with
Olympic and one with Reliance.
Olympic and Reliance and Berkeley
and Stanford were then to play,
the team winning the most games
to be champion of the Coast.
Olympic now conies forward and
claims the championship, alleging
that she has beaten both Stanford
and Reliance, while we have beaten
only Berkeley and Reliance. In
regard to this claim Captain Fick
ert expressed himself as follows:
"We are the champions and will
not play Olympic if she challenges
us. She bases her claim on the
fact that she beat Reliance in their
second game when as a matter of
fact that game was not in the
schedule. It was a private arrange
ment between the athletic clubs
and did not concern the univer
sities. We have beaten Berkeley
and Reliance, wliile Olympic has
won but one game, that against ns.
I can not see how Olympic can
reasonably dispute our title to the
championship.' 1
