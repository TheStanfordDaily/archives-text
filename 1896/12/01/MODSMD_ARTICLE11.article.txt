The poor freshmen do lmve such
a time to find a satisfactory name!
Brown University has adopted ''The
Century Class" as the most appro
priate. Other names that have
been suggested are: Naughty
Naught, 19', Double Aught and a
Green One, Ninety-Nit, XfX, Big
Nothing, Double Nit, Naughty-Nit,
Fin de Siecle, 0 Tuo, Di-ox ides.
Naught but Aught, Goose Eggs,
Just Begun, and Centenarians.
Princeton has chosen Nitty-Nit as
its name. Variety indeed! This
list may well be preserved. In a
hundred years it may be called for;
some changes, however, may be
necessary. "Nit" is a very expres
sive /? a d<', xicrle word and seems to
predominate in the above list. The
question is, will "nit" be in use a
hundred years from now? â€”Ripon
