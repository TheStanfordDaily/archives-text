The subject for the Carnot De
bate has been agreed upon by the
facultj 7 committees from the two
universities and relates to the edu
cational systems of France and the
United Htates. The subject is a
good one and should create consid
erable interest in its investigation.
A list of the books available for the
debaters in preparation for the
subject has been prepared, and the
only thing now remains for them
to make a thorough and conscien
tious use of the material at their
disposal.
The contest takes place on our
campus in February, and this fact
will doubtless prove a great incen
tive to our representatives.
