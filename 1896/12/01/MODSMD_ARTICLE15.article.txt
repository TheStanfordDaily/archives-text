A week or two ngo an attempt
was made to effect a permanent
organization of the Law Association,
composed of those taking Law as a
major, but owing to football ex
citement and other distractions it
was thought well to postpone the
matter until after the Thanksgiving
holidays.
The objects of the association
are to promote the study of Law
and the interests of the Law de
partment, and mutual acquaintance
among members. In pursuance of
these objects committees are to be
chosen to secure lecturers or to
arrange from time to time any
other programs that may be suit
able. Considering the isolated
situation of the University and the
non-professional character of our
Law department, it is obvious that
such an association can be made of
much profit to Law students. All
major students in Law should
therefore earnestly strive to be pres
ent at the meeting called for tomor
row evening and lend their aid in
making the new organization a
success.
Jt is proposed among other things
to secure the presence of noted lec
turers and lawyers at the Univer
sity at various times during the
year and thus give the students of
Law an opportunity to hear and
meet men of established reputation.
Besides this there are to be social

features to the club which alone
make it a very desirable organiza
tion to introduce into our life and
one which will fill a long-felt want.
