to all tin >se who are lovers of story

ture hy telling how lie first thought
of writing his "Tales of Languedoe."
A party of four, consisting of Pro
fessors Anderson, Flitgel, Lathrop,
and Brun, went on a pleasure trip
to Saratoga Springe. While at the
lunch table they entertained each
other with interesting anecdotes
and stories, and Prof. Brun told
one of the tales of which he was
fond as a hoy. The party at the
table were much interested in the
story, and when Prof. Brun said
the story was one of many told him
in his boyhood and had been handed
down in the family from his great
uncle, Prof. Anderson suggested
that they be collected together and
published in book form for all story
lovers to read. After several sug

nally did decide to write them for
pul >1 ieation.
Prof. Brun read from four of the
stories in bis book, '"The Three
Strong Men," ''The Adventures i
Meste Kege," ''The Marriage of
Monsieur Arcanvel," and ''Voting
Anglas." From these tales lie made
characteristic selections and read
them as only he who has heard
them told can read them.*
"It is very hard," said Professor
Brun, "to translate these stories
from the French into the English
The language of the south of France
being so musical and so rich in
idiom, the translator finds it next
to impossible to produce the same
effect in the English rendition that
is felt in reading them in the mother
tongue. Then, too, there are so
many gesticulations when thev are
told by the French story teller, and
the English people do not preface
their remarks by movements of the
head or body."
The pictures from Peixotto, who
is the illustrator of the book, were
shown pinned to a large black
board. They were the originals
and made a very interesting and
instructive miniature art-gallery.
