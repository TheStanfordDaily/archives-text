Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The overwhelming defeat of our
team last Thursday might reason
ably he expected to dishearten the
adherents of football here. It does
not seem to have done so however.
Though the out look for next year is
not at all bright, no thought of dis
may has been allowed to possess
our men, and plans are already be
ing made concerning the work next
season.
The university met a very heavy
loss in the death of Dr. Bonte last
Tuesday. Dr. Bonte has been sec
retary of tlie Board of Begents for
sixteen years arid much of the
weight of the management of the
university's finances has been
borne by him. All university
exercises were suspended Wednes
day as a mark of respect to his
memory.
Regent Reinstein and Instructor
May beck left for the East Tuesday
on business connected with the
plans for the permanent university
buildings. An informal banquet
was tendered Mr. Reinstein Satur
day evening in San Francisco by
members of the faculty.
The managers elected by the
junior class to publish the college
annual the "Blue and (lold" —
are at present very much in doubt
whether or not they shall proceed
with the publication. The present
senior class is very much in debt
from the publication of last year's
annual, and their experience is aet

ing as a damper upon the enthus
iasm of the juniors. A thorough
is being made by the man
agers, and if the necessary funds are
not forthcoming they will refuse to
proceed further with the publica
tion.
Owing to the holiday Wednesday
there was no meeting of the
Students' Congress. There was but
one meeting of the Science Associa
tion during the week —that of the
(Jeological and Mineralogical Sec
tion. The "Occurrence of Oligocene
Books on the West Coast" was dis
cussed by Mr. F. M. Anderson.
The only social event between
now and the holidays will be Junior
Promenade. Examinations begin
two weeks from today, so there will
be little done now outside sober
work at the studies.
