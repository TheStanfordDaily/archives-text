# Columbia Price Remains Unchanged.

### 
Those who have been in (suspense
concerning the price of Columbiiis
next year will lie happy to know
that the l'ope Manufacturing Co.
has finally announced it;* list at
•$lOO, the same price l as this year.
Those who have been timorous
about announcing prices will be
glad to know that this famous
company has concluded, and so an
nounces, that a strictly high-grade
wheel can not be sold for less
The 1897 Columbia bicycle will
surpass anything ever yet placed
on the market by this leading com
pany for strength and rigidity of
frame and consequent ease of run
ning. It is made of five per cent,
nickel steel tubing, the entire pro
duction of which is controlled by
the l'ope Manufacturing Co., and
is used exclusively in Columbia
bicycles. Iligid tests of the new
model have shown it to be one of
the strongest bicycles in the world,
and it combines in its construction
improved features, graceful and
beautiful appearance, and the full
est progress of mechanical in
genuity.
Rather than lower the standard
of bicycle making by lessening price
and consequently quality, this
company has adopted a wise policy
in raising the standard higher than
ever, giving the public the benefit
of many important improvements
in construction and material, with
out advancing the price of the
wheels. —A itirrirn // Wherlman.
