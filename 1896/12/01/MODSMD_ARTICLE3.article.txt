# The 						Financial Aspect of Football.

### 
Today's Examiner has this to say
editorially of the perplexing com
mercial aspect which college ath
letics have lately taken on:
''Home of our Eastern contem
poraries are indulging in moral re
flections over the fact that the gate
receipts at two college football
games in one day —Yale-Princeton
a nd Harvard-Pennsylvania—were
$(>5,000. They call attention to the
circumstance that some of the best
of the smaller colleges, with about
800 students each, have no more
than this for their entire support
fora year, that no institution in
the country has all the means it
needs for its educational work, and
that, the greatest and richest of our
universities would regard $65,000
as an important addition to its en
dowment. In the light of such
facts they ask whether it is right
to expect the community to spend
such a sum to see twenty-two young

j men chase a ball around a lot for
two hours. To sacrifice an amount
j that would educate 300 students,
lor that might give the world some
(great and beneficial scientific dis
| covery, for the sake of two football
I games seems like pushing aniuse
j nient to an extreme.
"But the case may be put even
more strongly than that. The al
ternative is not between paying
|-$(35,000 for two games of football
land going without, but between
1 paying $(35,000 and getting the
I same games fora good deal less,
j There is no need to go without foot
-1 ball, hut it can be played with just
; as much interest to the participants
I and spectators, and with just as
much benefit to the physical stand
ards of the college world, if it be
put upon a less commercial basis
, than the present one.
"At the Vale-Princeton game seats
;in the grandstand were sold by
speculators at <$25 a pair. The reg
ular prices of the seats for the
Berkeley-Stanford game ranged
from $1.50 to $2.50 apiece. The
j football managers of all the great
i universities in the country now
handle thousands, and in some
cases scores of thousands of dollars
a year, and the question of 'gate
i receipts' often becomes a more im
portant, one than the question of
: wholesome sport.
"it would be easy to cut down
! these enormous budgets without
detracting in the least from the
interest and the value of the game.
I The ideal state of affairs would be
one in which there were no ad
mission fees at all. There are cer
tain necessary expenses connected
i with football as it is played now
: which make it impractible to reach
this ideal until some benevolent
I millionaire shall endow athletic
sports, building a great amphi
| theatre like the Stadion at Athens
for one or more of the universities
[and investing a sum whose interest
i shall be sufficient to meet the inci
dental cost of the games. But the
paid coaches may easily be re
placed by volunteers from the
alumni, the cost of the training
tables mav be reduced by the
amounts which the players would
he paying if they were not in train
ing, and the total expenses may be
cut down practically to the charges
for uniforms, footballs and court
plaster, and the rent of grounds.
In that case an admission fee of
fifty cents would be amply sufficient
to keep the teams running; the boys
, would play just as hard, and the
I sport would be in a much healthier
j condition.
"Some time we hope to see a
great marble amphitheatre rise on
the Berkeley campus, and another
at Stanford, with an arena in which
football, baseball, tennis, and track
and field athletics may be exhibit
ed, with seats for 40,000 spectators,
and with gates wide open to all
comers without price. Possibly
some plutocratic full-back, filled
with enthusiasm for pure sport,
may build such a temple of bodily
science and give it to his alma ma
ter with the means to keep it up."
