# The Freshman Glee.
## 
### 
Final arrangements for the
Freshman (* lee Friday evening in
Eucina gymnasium are almost com
pleted, and the affair will probably
be a social and financial success.
II liber's orchestra, one of the best
in San Francisco, has been engaged
to furnish the music. More atten
tion has been paid this year to the
music and the condition of the
floor than formerly, and the deco
rations will be attractive. Twenty
dances are in the program, and
dancing will continue until 1 p.m.
Refreshments will be served during
the course of the evening.
Tickets for the Cilee and for the
buses can be procured at the same
time, making the charge for both
$3.00. Tickets may be procured of
the committeemen or at Rice's.
