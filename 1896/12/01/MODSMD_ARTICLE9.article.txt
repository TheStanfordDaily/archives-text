# Will Not Go to Santa Rosa.

### 
The management of the Glee and |
Mandolin Clubs has received word,
from Santa Rosa that the concertj
which it was proposed to hold in
that city on next Saturday even
ing has been declared off. This j
leaves the clubs in a somewhat
difficult position as they had al
ready signed contracts for their ap
pearance in Ukiah on Friday night,
and intended to play Santa Rosa j
the next night. Now there is much 1
doubt as to whether it will pay to
give the one concert in Ukiah, as
the expenses are nearly as great
for one as for both towns, while the j
receipts will be approximately re

duced one half. However, it is
probable that inasmuch as their ap
pearance in Ukiah has been exten
j sively advertised and many seats
for the entertainment have been
j already sold, the clubs will till the
date. The matter will be definitely
decided this evening.
