# Finals in the Tennis Doubles.

### 
After a very long drawn-out con
test, the final round in the Tennis
Tournament on Encina courts was
played this morning. The contest
was between Arnold, '95, and
Kaetzel, '97; and Hill, '98, and Mc-
Neil, '98, and resulted in a victory
for the former by a score of 6-4, 5-7,
9-7. Only three sets were played,
as the time was somewhat short.
The games as well as the sets were
very close and hovered between
"deuce" and "advantage" many
times. The last set was particu
lar!)' close, and it was anybody's
match n|> to the last moment.
This leaves Arnold and Kaetzel
the winners of the tournauuni and
entitles them to the I'niversity
championship in doubles for the
semester, unless challenged by
Freeman and I'icher, last year's
champions.
