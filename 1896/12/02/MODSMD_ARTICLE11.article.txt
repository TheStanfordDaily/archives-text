All are satisfied that the Glee
and Mandolin Ciuhs have done the
right tiling in deciding to fulfill
their engagement at Ukiah on next

golden rule in such a case, and the
musical organizations have come
to a proper decision in determining
to uphold agreements made hy
them even though others do not.
