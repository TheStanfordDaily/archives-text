An article in a lale Occident
strongly advocates tlie establish
ment of Pacific Coast intercollegiate
boating as a stimulus to the local
boating interests and as a means of
introducing systematic rowing into
the realm of athletics at U. C. The
writer notes the possibility of estab
lishing a crew at Stanford, and
urges action in this matter.
From time to time such suggest
ions come down from I J. C. and
the belief seems general in that re
gion that Stanford has boating
facilities equal to their own. It is
time that our friends from the hills
of Berkeley understood the con
ditions that exist here, and which
make the establishment of a boat
ing club a practical impossibility.
San Francisco bay i-< about three
miles from the University as the
crow Hies and about live by the
only available road. There is no
regular transportation; the seeker
after aquatics mis to drive, walk,
or ride awheel to reach the bay at
all. l>ut even if the question of
transportation were overcome,
there are other difficulties. The
bay is a mud flat, navigable only
at high tide. At low tide there is
a quarter of a mile of slimy mud
between the landings and the wa
ter. A crew could practice there
only at high tide, and the variation

in the time of high tide would pre-1
I vent any regular practice. Again,;
j the tide in rapid and would make
it very dangerous for a racing shell.
Mowing is one of the cleanest and
most valuable forms of athletics,I
and it is a matter of regret that we I
are shut out from this sport; hut:
until the physical characteristics of I
this region accommodate themselves ,
I to our wishes, boating, as a sport, |
at Stanford is out of the question.
