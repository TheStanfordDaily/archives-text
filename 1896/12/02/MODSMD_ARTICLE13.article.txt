# The
						Season in the East.

### 
It has been an interesting foot
ball season in the East, marked by
the rise of smaller university teams,
land by strange reversals amongst
the leaders. The first, surprise was
| the defeat of Pennsylvania by
Lafayette, formerly a minor colhge
! in athletics. t hen the Carlisle
j Indians swam into the pen of
Eastern athletes and furnished the
j surprise of the season. Tliey be
gan by virtually tying Yale, al
though the announced score was
| 12-6. Princeton, the season's
i champions, walked av ay with them
122-6, but they held Harvard to
one touch-down and very nearly
j scored against the crimson. They
are a strong, hardy team, depending
j upon weight and line-bucking
j tactics'rather than on team work.
If they had possessed a good punter
they might have today been carry
ing the sea Ins of all the 1 >ig pale
face elevens, but they have no
kicker behind the line. The work
| of this team will be watched with
interest next year. It is expected
that one or two of the dusky brave*
will figure on this year's a 11-
[ America eleven.
Princeton is the undoubted cham
pion, having downed Harvard 12-0
'and Vale 24—6. Next in order ex
j perts place Pennsylvania, on the
I strength of her 8—6 victory over
Harvard, while the latter runs a
j close third. Vale takes a hack
seat this year, finishing, in spite of
' the efforts of Camp, Heffellinger, ct
! al., an easy fourth.
The season has been marked by
clear, straight football, with plenty
of kicking and with play of a cy
clonic; order. There have been few
accidents, no slugging, and much
I good feeling. The attendance at
I the Vale-Princeton game was larger
than ever before, and the tremen
dous increase in the receipts from
! these games has led the Eastern
press into unfavorable comments on
the financial aspect, of amateur
' sport.
Exit the season of '96, one of the
! pleasantest and most prosperous in
the history of the game, and one
j which Stanford men will long re
member.
