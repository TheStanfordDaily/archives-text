Editor Daily Palo Alto:*
Musicians are said to be cranks.
Some of our local organizations are
no exception to the rule. After all
this hullabaloo and anxiety to
make a holiday tour of the North
west, it is now rumored that some
of the members of the musical clubs
have been absenting themselves
from practice and decline to
along on the trip, their indifference
seriously crippling the clubs and
threatening to balk the entire enter
prise.
A bitch at this late date is
peculiarly unseasonable and un
fortunate. All preliminary arrange
ments are practically completed.
A circuit of eleven towns has been
booked, the dates closed up, and
the press of the Northwest lias an
nounced that victorious Stanford
will make a triumphal tour of the
Coast during the holidays. Further
more, (be advertising matter is al
ready in press, exceeding in quality
and quantity anything attempted
on any of the previous tours. The
musical clubs can not afford to go
back on their plans and leave ilu
student body with this expensive
mass of useless material charged
up to its account, nor can the clubs
afford to cancel their engagements
with the principal towns of the
North and invito the disfavor of a
country which has been exception
ally loyal to Stanford and has
never failed to accord her a warm
reception. The indifference of a
few members must give way to
larger interests. If these men
didn't expect to stand by the clubs
why did they join them? There
were many other musical candi
dates for these positions; and most
of them would have recognized an
obligation to their alma mater.
When Kaufman and Wells call
their clubs to line up for practice,
preparatory for an extensive tour,
the members of the clubs should re
spond to the call of duty as readily
as the men of the gridiron. A. A.
