# New Columbia Model.
## 
### 
The Pope Manufacturing Com
pany has in its new models dis
carded round tubing in the rear
forks, external joints, and reversed
the construction of its crank
hanger. The head tubing will
measure 1 1-4 inches, the main
frame 1 1-8 inches, while the rear
fork will be 7-8 inch, D-section ta
pering rearwardly to 5-8 inch round
tubing. The rear uprights are 5-8
inch diameter. Internal jointswill
be used. The handle-bar and seat
post fastening will be effected by
means of bolts and clamps. The
frame angles have not been dis
turbed to any great extent. The
single piece fork crown has given
way to the open crown constructed
upon the same designs as that
which was used in the Hartford
models this season. The mortised
end of the crank-hanger is now on
the left instead of the right, which
is a reversal of the method of con
struction used this season. The
chain line is inside of the bearings.
The tread is five inches. The bear
ing contact is at two points. No
gear cases will be fitted to the mod
els. The Hartford models are very
like in appearance to the Columbia
patterns, although an expert would
have no difficulty in recognizing
ihe difference between the two. The
new tandems have undergone great
changes.
