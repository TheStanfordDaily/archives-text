# Basket-Ball.
## 
### 
About thirty-live girls are prac
ticing regularly on the basket-ball
Held. Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday are the days for regular
work, and there is 110 doubt that
when the season closes there will be
a good strong team in the field.
Things are being kept rather quiet
now regarding possible games, for
as yet no challenge has been re
ceived from the University of Cali
fornia.
Meanwhile there will be general
practices, interchips games,and per
haps two or three games with C'as
tilleja. It is hoped that a trophy
may be obtained, but as yet, no def
inite arrangements have been made.
Jierkeley, it is reported, is practic
ing hard and has a good corps of
girls from which to choose for the
team. Very little will be known
or said definitely until after the
holidays, when the real hard work
will begin and when the action of
ihe Herkeley team will have been
decided upon.
