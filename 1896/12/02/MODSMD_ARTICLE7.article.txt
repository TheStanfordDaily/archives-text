Last night's lecture was given by
Mr. Edward Berwick of Pacific
Grove, his subject being "The Nic
aragua Canal." Mr. Berwick
opened his lecture with a brief out
line of California's history. He
spoke as follows:
1 arrived in California in 1865 at
a time when she was going through
a period of great depression. The
whole Coast was despondent; the
gold days were a tradition; the pas
toral days of California were at an
end. The years of drought of '68
and '(54 had wiped out all the
horses and sheep of Southern Cali
fornia; there was nothing to meet
the eyes hut skeletons. California
was suffering from commercial iso
lation, and was at war with the
other parts of the world.
In 1882 California exported for
ty-three million dollars' worth of
wheat; in 1894 Â£he exported eight
and one half million dollars'worth.
That is why California found
things hard in 1894. lint what
was the reason of this? California
could not compete with the Argen
tine Republic, which imported ma
chinery from the Eastern States of
America and laborers from Europe.
Commercial war was the conse
quence, which in time leads to ruin
and starvation. The only way to
compete is to get rid of the eight
thousand miles that separate us
from the market; otherwise farmers
can not live in California. It is
impossible to ?end the goods by
rail or by the Panama route. To
send it round Cape Horn is finan
cially impossible. We are handi
capped in every respect regarding
the shipment of wheat from Cali
fornia. We can not compete with
Argentina, which is eight thousand
miles nearer.
The Nicaragua Canal was first
talked about in 1582 when Cortez
visited America. In 1780 William
Pitt had the route surveyed, and
since then it has been surveyed
time and time again, and it is found
that the Nicaragua is the most
promising of all the routes on ac
count of the depression of the
mountain chains at that place. The
actual excavation required is 26 8
miles. The total length of the
route is 109.4 miles; and 2.9 miles
of rock must he cut through, which
would take about four years.
Lake Nicaragua has the great re
commendation of being fresh water.
This is of advantage to vessels com
ing from the sea, for all the vege
table and animal growths on the
ship die in the fresh water.
The expense of the canal is esti
mated at sixty-five millions, and it
has been learned by actual count
that in eighty-three years the U. S.
could have this canal and not be a
cent in debt. Argentina has the
wheat market. She is now advanc
ing to the horticultural stage, for
the republic is peopled by born hor
ticulturists from Southern France.
California has to take up this
matter and fight for herself; the
Eastern States will not tight for
her. Everyone can do something
to further this cause, either by pen
or word of mouth. ''There still is
need for martyrs and apostles,''
and there will have to be as good
kicking done before this canal will
be constructed, as is necessary to

win an intercollegiate football
game.
