Bishop John P. Newman, who
will preach in the chapel next Sun
day, is one of the leaders
of the -Methodist Church and
probably its most eloquent
preacher. His address at the fun
eral of General Grant at Alt. McGre
gor, N. Y , has been considered one
of the ablest efforts delivered in
memory of a great man. For
twelve years the bishop was pastor
of the Metropolitan M. E. Church
at Washington and for five years
was chaplain of the U. S. Senate.
In 1875 General Grant appointed
him Inspector of Consulates, and in
the discharge of his duties he made
a tour of the world. On bis re
turn he wrote a detailed report on
the U. S. consular service. His
contributions to literature include
several works on religious subjects
and some books of travel, notably
'â€¢Babylon and Nineveh." He was
a personal friend of the late Sen
ator Stanford, and when young
Leland Stanford died in IH.S4 it
was Bishop Newman who preached
the sermon at his funeral in Grace
Church, San Francisco.
I>r. Newman has just entered
upon his term as Bishop of Califor
nia and will probably remain in
the state four years.
