The danger of collision between
pedestrians and wheelmen on Uni
versity avenue has been done away
with by the construction of the bi
cycle path. So long as the bi
cyclists maintain their exclusive
right to the use of the path all will
be well; but it is possible that the
walkers may be tempted to that
side too and then there will be the
same difficulty as before.
To make the change a perma
nent one it might be advisable to
construct a new walk on the oppo
site side of the avenue for the use
of pedestrians. During the rainy
season the need of a hard, dry walk
is sadly felt.
