It is somewhat a matter of re
lief that the fall tournament on
Encina courts inaugurated by the
University Tennis Club has at
last been brought to a close. After
having been dragged out to a
wearisome length by the indiffer
ence and apathy of the members of
the club, the winners can now be an
nounced.
That there is something wrong
with the club this year is shown
by the experience of this tourna
ment. Seldom has there been
such a lack of interest in a cham
pionship affair as the contest just
concluded can boast. It was often
difficult to obtain balls for the
matches, and much more difficult
to prevail on the players to select a
common time for playing them.
This situation is not the fault of
the management, for it has no
means or opportunity to make it
otherwise; but it seems to lie inher
ently in a system which completely
isolates this branch of athletics
from other forms of University
sport. The Tennis Club is finding
it increasingly hard to maintain a
useful existence as it is now con
stituted, and shows the need of ef
fective reorganization.
