The football game is over and
the debates are before us. It is to
be remembered tbis will probably
be tbe critical year in the history
of debating in vhe University, as a
third successful victory for Berkeley
gives her the cup. To succeed, the
Stanford contingent must first pos
sess the support of the students of

the University. Last year none of
the preliminaries were well at
tended, and on one occasion not
more than forty people were pres
ent. It is needless to point out
that this lack of enthusiasm means
defeat.
The victories of the University of
California during the last two years
have been largely due to the per
sonal efforts of one man, a member
of the Berkeley faculty, who has
devoted himself to the training of
the debating team. During the
same period not the slightest en
couragement has been given the
Stanford team. Notwithstanding
the fact that preparation for either
debate necessitates economic and
historical training of the highest
value, no credit or mitigation of
University work has been allowed.
The advisability of some action
along this line is respectfully sug
gested to the executive committee
of the inter-Society Debating
League
The lack of training in voice cul
ture and elocution was largely re
sponsible for the two Stanford de
feats of last year. if the Uni
versity is not able lo furnish as
sistance, there is no reason why a
voluntary movement should not be
set on foot to remedy this defi
ciency. Henry \>. Sheldon.
