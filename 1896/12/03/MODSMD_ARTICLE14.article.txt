# Concerning College Slang.
## 
### 
The American Dialect Society,
through its secretary, Prof. Eugene
11. Babbitt of Columbia University,
recently sent to all the leading
American colleges a circular asking
for assistance in collecting infor
mation about college slang.
The circular contains a list of
words about which the members of
each college are requested to give
the following information : First,
whether the word is in use among
them ; second, in what sense the
word is used, with examples ;
third, what part of speech it is.
The following words make up the
list, in regard to which these ques
tions are asked: Ball-up, bone,
cinch, co-ed, cram, crib, tiend,
flunk, fresh, fruit, grind, grub,
horse, jolly, lunch, hooks, play
horse with, pluck, play pony, prep,
prune, quiz, ride, roast, sheepskin,
snap, stunt, and trot.
Besides answering the above
questions about the words con
tained in the list, the college offi
cials are asked to interest the stu
dents in collecting lists of slang
words and phrases peculiar to their
own institutions, that these addi
tional collections may be compared
by the Dialect Society with slang
expressions in use elsewhere.
