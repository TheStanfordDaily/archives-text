Chapel attendance at the Uni
versity of Chicago has been made
compulsory one day in the week.
William McKeever of Phila
delphia was elected captain for
next year hy the Cornell football
ten in.
Twenty candidates are now in
training for the Harvard Fencing
Club team. Professor Rondelle is
their instructor.
The Pennsylvania team, after
the Cornell game, elected John M.
Minds, who has been playing full
back this season, captain of next
year's football team.
Some of the athletic authorities of
Vale and Harvard have met and
talked over future athletic meet
ings between the two universities
in a (juiet wa v. It is probable that
there will be a reconciliation before
next fall.
The advisory board on debating
has decided to reduce faculty coach
ing of the intercollegiate debating
team to a minimum. This is in
direct opposition to the policy
adopted at Yale, where faculty
coaching is carried to an extreme.
A committee composed of gradu
ates of the University of Pennsyl
vania, appointed by the (ilee Club,
have just published a collection of
''Pennsylvania Songs," the first
since 187*). In the volume now
published the compilers have pre
sented: First, a group of songs pe
culiar to the University of Penn
sylvania; second, selections suited
for use by college glee clubs in gen
eral: third, several part songs for
male voices of a more serious char
acter.
The lens of the great telescope of
the observatory of the University of
Chicago, at Lake Geneva, Wiscon
sin, has been completed after two
and a half years' labor by Prof. Al
van Clark of Cambridge, Mass. Its
focus distance is sixty-one feet; the
extreme diameter of the clear aper
ture is forty-one and three-eighths
inches. The cost of the glass plates
in Paris was $40,000, and the entire
cost of the lens will probably reach
$100,000.
The hare and hound run is be
coming a popular athletic event at
Harvard. There were two runs
held last week. In the first run
lifty-eight hounds and two hares
entered. Forty of these finished.
The hares are given live minutes
start and must gain seven minutes
on the hounds; that is, the hares
must finish twelve minutes before
the hounds. In the race of No
vember 10 the hounds reached the
finish eleven minutes after the
hares, thus winning by one minute.
