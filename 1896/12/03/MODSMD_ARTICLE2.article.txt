### 
Arrnmgeinents have been com
pleted by the student body man
agement to have Miss Ellen Beach
Yaw appear in the chapel on Fri
day evening of next week. Some
thing about this wonderful singer
may be of interest.
Miss Yaw is something more
than a tine singer; her voice is a
phenomenal one in the fullest sense
of that much abused term. It ex
tends over nearly four octaves, from
(r below to 10 in the altissimo. The
world records only one other singer
approaching such a range— Lucre
zia Ajugari-— a, protege of Mozart,
and Miss Yaw goes four full tones
higher.
Aside from the extraordinary
compass, Mi-s Yaw's voice has re
ceived high praise for its sweetness
and purity of tone.
Miss Yaw's appearance here will
be an event that will be looked for
ward to, not merely by musicians
but by all music lovers.
Perhaps no American girl has
ever so suddenly set the world
ablaze with the phenomenal nature
of her talent as Miss Ellen Beach
Yaw. There is no excess of zeal in
accounting hers, what the world is
fast acknowledging it to be, the
most astounding soprano voice in
history. Much of her girlhood was
spent in California, near Las Cres
centa and Los Angeles. The greater
part of her culture was under the
tuition of Mine. Bjordsten, in New
York, who later accompanied her
pupil to Paris and placed her un
der the instruction of the famous
Delle Sedie and Bax. From time
to time the whispers in the Parisian
studios about the fair American
marvel found an echo in the French
press, and the Paris Galignani was
particularly enthusiastic in her
praise. She had not dedicated her
voice to the public as yet, so the
fair American continued her devo
tion to her studies. About two
years ago while Miss Yaw was still

abroad the New York Herald, hav
ing learned of the prodigious na
ture of this new voice, published a
column article headed, "Mist? Yaw's

Wonderful Voice." It dec hi red
that voice as having the greatest
compass of any voice recorded hy
history —a range of nearly four oc
taves, from (5 helow the staff to E
in the altissimo, and expressed sur
prise that a voice reaching such an
altitude slum Id express such breadth
and beautiful quality of tone in the
lower and medium registers. The
following comparison will be of in
terest:

lfer method has evoked as much
comment as the wonderful altitude
and Lyric sweetness of her voice.
It. is faultness. Her tones are pro
duced without the slightest physical
effort.
Her repertoire embraces (lie com
posers, pjist and present, in the
English, French, Italian, and Swed
ish languages. She is especially
fund of (irieg, whose northern bal
lads are numerous among her suc
cesses
Miss Yaw is accompanied by Mr.
Maximilian Dick, violinist, and
Miss Cieorgiella Lay, pianist. Tick
ets have been specially reduced to
one dollar.
