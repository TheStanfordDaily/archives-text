# The 						Sympsychograph.

### 
lii a recent number of the Popular
Science Monthly Dr. Jordan ex
plains the true significance of his
contribution on t lie subject of
thought photography which ap
peared some time ago:
1 was both surprised and humili
ated to find on my return from
Bering Sea, a few days ago, a large
correspondence from persons who
had taken the "Bympsychograph"
seriously. I had not the slightest
idea that any one capable of "read
ing bound books" would be
deceived by the meaningless phrases
in that bit of burlesque. I intended
it as a piece of gentle satire on the
"wizards" and "impressionists" who
follow in the wake of scientific work
which attracts attention, and who
pour their vagaries into the long
ears of the daily newspaper.
The important element of one's
belief arises from the way in which
that belief is formed. No one was
capable of understanding my story
who did not at once see the in
congruity of it. One might as well
believe in Mahatmas and Odic
forces as in cathode radiation or
evolution if he does not have any
clear ideas or a clear conception of
the basis on which generalizations
rest. One writer speaks of the
article in question as a hoax upon
an innocent public; but a public
which has swallowed the alleged
experiments of Inglis Rogers and
other impressionists as scientific
truth, and does not see an_v differ
ence between the methods of these
persons and the methods of Rontgen
and lielmholtz, is not an innocent
public. A vast amount of suffer
ing in our society arises from the
fact that men are ready to follow
any notion in medicine, in politics,
or in social reform, no matter how
absurd, if it contains an element of
mystery, or if it proposes to make
life a little easier for men incapable
of clear thinking.
I had a serious moral in the
fable, and this, at the risk of try
ing to explain a joke, 1 shall give.
The methods ascribed to the
"Astral Camera Club" are those
which never have yielded and never
can yield any results to science.
Scientific investigators are not
"wizards," their discoveries are not
presaged by uncanny feelings nor
grcen darkness, nor is there any
thing '"occult" about their ways of
working. They are simply men of
unusual persistence and steady
common sense. Everything easy
was found out long ago, and ad
ditions to knowledge can only come
from mastery of past achievements
and mathematical accuracy in the
registration of small details. The
progress of science is not marked
by surprises and contradictions.
The result of scientific inquiry
conies as a surprise only to those
ignorant of the steps in investi
gation which leads up to it.
The discovery that the peculiar
rays called "X" by Ronetgen could
be made to cast shadows on a
sensitized plate does not imply that
thought can be photographed.
One might sooner expect to photo
graph the songs of birds than "the
cat's idea of man."
The great power which exact
knowledge gives adds nothing to
the probability of the mythology of

our own or other times. The
"power of mind over mutter" is not
a form of hysterics. Jt depends on
exact knowledge of the nature of
material tilings, it is no occult
influence showing itself in neurotic
"adepts" by uncanny lights, under
"astral" conditions, it is greatest
by day-light, with sane men, with
whom science is simply enlightened
"common sense."
