The Social Science Club met last
evening for its first discussion un
der the revised constitution, which
limits the membership to twenty
five and provides that a member
who is absent from three consecutive
meetings, without a good excuse,
shall forfeit membership. Miss
Howe read an interesting paper on
"Civil Service" and Frank Adams,
'00, presented"The Social Effects
of the Bicycle." After this an in
formal discussion of the papers was
held.
At the next meeting there will be
a discussion upon the issues likely
to come before the Fifty-Fourth
Congress.
