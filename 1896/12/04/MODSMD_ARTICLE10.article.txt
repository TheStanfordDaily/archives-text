AFTEit the Thanksgiving game it
was a (iitmmon expression among
Berkeley menâ€”"Well, we'll make
up by heating Stanford in debate."
To beat, us in dehate for the third
time in succession would do much
to console Berkeleyans for the de
feat of their football team. To
beat us in debate for the third time
in succession is what they are going
to try with all their might to do.
And that is what Stanford should
do her utmost this year to prevent.
So long as we can not equal
Berkeley in debate they can very
easily brush aside a football de
feat by saying, "We must admit
that Stanford has the brawn, but
then you must remember that
Berkeley has the brains. The de
velopment of brains is what a uni
versity is supposed to exist for, any
how."
