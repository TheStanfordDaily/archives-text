The "perpetual freshman" reas
serted himself hist night on the
oval when several members of that
genus "guyed'' unmercifully some
new candidates for the track team.
We have had just about enough of
that sort of thing here. The men
who act in this manner toward
green athletes are the very ones
who wax most enthusiastic over
our athletic victories. It is the
rule rather than the exception that
the second team men who keep the
Varsity candidates working have
as much to do with a victory as
the lirst team men themselves.
Let no new track man desist
from practice because of anything

which may have been said or done
on the occasion mentioned. The
perpetual freshman will in time
weary of the amusement to be se
cured in discouraging prospective
Varsity athletes, and return to his
ancient pastime of painting college
buildings or smashing furniture in
Encina.
