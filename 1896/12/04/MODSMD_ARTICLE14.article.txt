Quite nil excursion of university:
j»e<>}» le, consisting of the Glee, |
Mandolin, and Banjo Clubs and
the second eleven, visited the Nevada
State University last week. A con
cert was given Friday evening and
a football game was played Satur-j
day. They were the guests of the J
university and were all well treated j
by the Nevada people. The high !
altitude, however, and the cold
weather which prevailed proved a ,
serious disadvantage to the football!
players. The thermometer stood
far below the freezing point and
the football Held was frozen to a
depth <>t' four inches at the time the
game was called. This, of course, j
was quite a novel experience for
many of the Californians, but was]
nevertheless far from pleasant, j
The (fame was won by our boys by
a score of 44-0.
The Philosophical Union has
now completed the arrangements
concerning Dr. Harris' lectures.
Dr. Harris is expected to arrive;
December 16, and will begin hisi
lectures on the l<Sth. 11c will!
deliver six addresses, all bearing
upon his Commentary on Hegel's j
Logic which lias been studied by
the Union during the present term.
Later on Dr. Harris will lecture j
before the State Teachers' Associ
ation at its convention in San .Jose.
It is his intention, also, to collect
information concerning the State's
educationa 1 system.
In the last letter the Thanks
giving Regatta was carelessly over
looked. Our crew came out third
in the race, yet they made a very
satisfactory showing. They kept |
close upon the other boats and
finished but a little more than a
boats' length behind the leading
crew. The two crews which did
come in ahead, bad had the ad
vantage of a great deal more ex
perience. Captain Cole is deter
mined to keep his men at work and
confidently expects better results
in the future.
The library has just been pre
sented by Mr. Avery of New York
with three rare books concerning
California. One is Gemeling's
'• Disputatis geographica de vera
Californiale situ et condilione,"
which was written in 173!), and the
other two are translations of Yene
ga's "History of California,'' one
into French and one into German.
This latter work was written 17(57.
The Students' Congress will hold
a debate with the Literary and
Debating Society of Hastings Law
School at its next meeting. The
question is the same one considered
last year in the intercollegiate de
bate —popular election of senators.
The Congress will uphold the neg- j
ative of the proposition.
