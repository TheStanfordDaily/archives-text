# Meeting of the English Club.

### 
The English Club held its third
meeting yesterday afternoon. Prof.
Lathrop presented a paper upon
"The Relation of Fielding to Cer
vantes." He compared the two
humorists in respect to the purpose
of each and the acknowledged in
debtedness of the English author to
the Spanish. He pointed out that
the inserted stories of Fielding are
characteristically Cervantic. "The
sources of the humor are the same
in the works of both. In both the
reader h;is admiration for the
heroes notwithstanding the crazi
ness of Quixote and the simplicity
of Parson Andrews. The two
authors were in manj r points alike
in their private lives."
The paper was interspersed with
apt quotations which rendered it
highly entertaining. At the close
of the reading a short informal
discussion was engaged in, chiefly
by Professors Anderson and Lath
rop. The former recommended
that the paper be. given sometime
as a Tuesday evening lecture.
