## 
### 
"President Cleveland lias today
purchased the residence of Mrs.
Slidell, on Bayard avenue in
Princeton, and will make Princeton
his permanent home soon after the
expiration of hi> term as President.
Negotiations looking to thi-* have
been in progress about three weeks,
and were consummated today by
the purchase of the property. A
number of reasons have attracted
President and Mrs. Cleveland to
Princeton. The President's father
was educated for the Presbyterian
ministry here. The quiet and in
dependent home life of the place,
its henlthfulness, its convenience to
New York, and the attractions of a
University society have been influ
ential in forming bis decision."
