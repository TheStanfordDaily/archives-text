The students and professors who
were in the city Thanksgiving day
experienced a delightful surprise as
they walked up Market street and
had their attention attracted all at
once by a large portrait of * our
honored President in the center of
one of I)oxey's show windows. To
the right of Dr. Jordan's picture
was a copy of the photograph of
Senator Stanford so familiar to us
all. and to the left was a copy of i
the painting in the library, of Le- j
land Stanford .1 r.
The window was lined with a j
cardinal background. Above the i
pictures mentioned was a white j
banner bearing these words:

Literature." In the window were

student in the University had any !
idea of the great number and va- !
