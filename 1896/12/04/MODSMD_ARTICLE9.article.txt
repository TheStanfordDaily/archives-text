If the practical difficulties can
lie overcome, and there is no very
good reason why they can not,
there can he no doubt that the sug
gestion of having alternate inter
collegiate debates in San Jose is a
good one. In the city of San
Francisco, always a blue and gold
town, it is next to impossible to get
an audience sympathetic to Stan
ford. The lack of a sympathetic
audience does much to dampen the
ardor of any speaker. This is not
the only objection either. The
judges of debate are always apt to
be influenced by the way in which
a debater affects his audience.
