## Bishop Newman on "Self-Mastery." 
### 
The largest chapel attendance of
the year greeted Bishop Newman of
San Francisco yesterday. Rev. Mr.
Burwell of Palo Alto delivered the
opening invocation, and Dr. Tho
biirn re;id the scriptures. Bishop
Newman spoke, in brief, as follows,
taking his text from I'roverbs xvi,
M2. ''lie that ruleth his spirit is
better than he that taketh a city.''
The archives of tlie past are
replete with the records of man's
genius and the monuments of man's
work. The deeds of man are re
corded in song, celebrated in pane
gyric, graven in marble. It is man's
ambition, this perpetuation of Ins
genius, this remembrance »>f his
work. But what shall we say of
the man who seeks to put himself
in harmony with nature, to con
form with the divine law; whoseeks
to curb his appetites, to control his
moral and intellectual nature, to
live in accordance with the pre
cepts of our Lord and Savior?
What Phidias shall crown him in
marble, what Horner sing his glory,
what Xeiiophon record his deeds?
(iod alone gives him the reward
and crowns his striving.
What shall we say, on the other
hand, of him who gaineth an em
pire and does not get control over
himself? Self-mastery; it is the
secret of character—true self-mas
tery. Remember, self-mastery is
not moral suicide; it is not the
stamping out of our passions and
desires. Each one of them was
given us fora good purpose and is
to be used legitimately within
proper bounds. You and I can
have no sympathy with that theol
ogy which tries to stamp out our
desires. Jesus Christ himself was
a man with human passion and hu
man knowledge. We can have no
feeling today for those who go to
monasteries to escape temptation.
Temptation is a compliment to
one's moral nature. The totally
depraved are never tempted, but he
who is striving toward the heights,
he who is reaching out toward (Sod,
is the one who feels temptation.
There is an old saying that vice
is the excess of virtue. There is
something in that bit of pagan phi
losophy. There are two great facts
in moral existence, law and the
limitation <>112 law. He is the truly
virtuous man who lives within the
limit of the law. Our impulses and
appetites are given us fora good
purpose, and, gratified legitimately
and within the law, they are as
holy as the sacrament; it is when
it goes outside the bounds of the
law that gratification becomes
sinful.
So if you ask me, "'What is self
mastery?" 1 can say, It is living
within the limits of the law. The
truly natural man is the holy man.
The clergy are wrong when the}'
tell us to come into the light of the
gospel. What they should say is,
''Come into the light of nature by
means of the gospel."
Self-knowledge, self-denial, self
consecration — these are necessary to
self-mastery. First and funda
mental is self-knowledge. The gen
eral criticism I make on modern ed
ucation is that it leads a man out
side himself. Too many college

I graduates step outside knowing
much more about the stratification
of rocks than about the structure of
their own bodies. In education we
are still sitting at the feet of (ireece
and the Middle Ages.
The second factor in self-mastery
tis self-denial. Perhaps there is no
, greater achievement than compell
ing ourselves to do that which we
do not want to do. Self-denial is
the refusal to follow our own incli-|
nations. The people of the world
reproach the church because of I
! their 1 >elief in this self-denia 1. It is j
| Hot fanaticism, nevertheless. It is!
I the realization of a higher devotion !
Jto virtue. One may drink moder-1
lately ami not be a drunkard, yet J
the Christian repudiates this mod-)
crate drinking, harmless perhaps!
to him, because of its effect on his!
weaker brother. '"If drink maketh |
imy neighbor to offend, then will I i
| taste no drink while the world
j standeth.''
Last of all. there is self-consecra- ,
| tion. Friends, I come today to
i speak as a witness. I have been in
■ all nations, seen all shrines,
i mingled with all devotees; I have!
lin my library the sacred books of
nations, and am thereby stronger
in the belief in Christ. I there
i fore am in earnest when I say you j
will find complete self-mastery only
on your knees at the foot of Christ's
cross.
