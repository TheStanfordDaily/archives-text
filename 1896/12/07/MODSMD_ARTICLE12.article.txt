One of the most serious deficien
cies in this cloistered life of ours is
the absence of good musical and
dramatic performances close at
hand. W'e get some half a dozen
good concerts each year, but that is
all; there is no good theatre to he
gotten at short of San Francisco,
and positively no good music of the
orchestral sort except that pro
duced by our own amateurs.
It is a disadvantage that it is
probably impossible to overcome.
There are many advantages on the
side of the isolated "fanner'' col
lege like Stanford, but there is no
great gain without some small loss,
and the impossibility of satisfying
artistic tastes along these lines is
the loss in this case.
