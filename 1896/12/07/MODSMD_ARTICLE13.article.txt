A decisive victory such as that
won l>y the Varsity on Thanksgiv
ing day is rightly a matter for re
joicing, hut in our celebration we
should not lose sight of the fact
that there are other important ath
letic events coming. There is no
reason to doubt that Berkeley is
hiding her disappointment by re
doubling her efforts 10 win other
contests. This is especially true of
the field-day. I ntil last year her
supremacy in the field and on the
track was conceded by almost every
one. Last year she was forced to
make a hard light to tie the score.
Our preparation for the spring
field-day must not be neglected in
any way.
Kverv inducement is offered at
Berkeley for the men to get out for
fall training, while it is actually
discouraging for men to get out for
regular work on our cinder path.
It is in miserable condition. The
new cinders have already been put
on and nothing remains to be done
except the rolling. It seems that
this is not so great an obstacle as
to keep men from work for several
weeks. The apparatus for the field
events is also in bad condition and
should be attended to at once. It
should immediately be made pos
sible fora larger squad of men to
get out in all of the events if we
intend to break the tie of last year
with a victory.
