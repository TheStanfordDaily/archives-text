In the contest in the board of
directors of the Cornell Sun, which
has been adjusted, the committee
of students a nd preifessors a ppointed
to arbitrate hit at the cause in re
commending "'That the element of
private and pecuniary gain be, so
far as possible, eliminated from all
enterprises conducted in the name
of the university and for the stu
dent body."' If this recommend
ation should take effect the joke
"rich as a Sim editor" would lose
its point, lint it is not likely to
be carried out. All the student
publications except the monthly
Cornell Magazine are money-mak
ing affairs. The competition for
positions is twice as active as for
class oMiees, and the machine is al
ways at work. Only a year or so
ago when the two factions on the
Sim board were lied, they could not
agree on an organization, and two
Sun* appeared on the horizon till
the students voted one down. The
organization is important because
the editor-in-chief and business
manager receive two shares each,
while the other editors receive one
each. Sun men are chosen partly
by class election, partly by com
petition. Those trying the latter
may endeavor to - fill as many
inches as possible. The editor-in
chief measures the inches and
makes a recommendation to the
board at the end of the year. Last
spring it was charged l hat an editor
too friendly to one competitor had
measured some five hundred inches
too much for him. A mass meet
ing of students referred the matter
to a committee of live who easily
settled the case, showing that there
had been a mistake but no unfair
intention. They recommend be
sides tlie elimination of the money
element, a more definite statement
and frequent publication of the
terms of the competition, a weekly
instead of a yearly count of inches,
and that all competitors be present
when measurements are taken.
