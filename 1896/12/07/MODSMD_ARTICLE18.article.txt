# Compulsory Chapel at Chicago.
## 
### 
In his Quarterly Iteport, dated
October, 1, 18HB, President Harper
<>112 the University of Chicago called
attention to their experiment <>112
voluntary morning chapel, which,
as far as attendance was concerned,
he admitted had been a virtual
failure. '"Where does the difficulty
lie?" he asked. It could not be be
cause there was no religious spirit
in the university, nor because the
chapel service had been dull or un
interesting. Kvery effort had been
made to make the service alt ractive,
the strongest men on the university
staff and in the pulpits of Chicago
had been called as leaders, and still
without avail.
"Is it after all," President Harper
continued, ''that in student life as
in every life there is needed for the
performance of many of the higher
duties a sense of obligation coming
either from without or within?
And is it possible that the policy of
required attendance is perhaps
better? The great majority of our
student body is made up of pro

fessed Christians. Is it too much
to ask such t«» meet together once
a day fora few minutes of medi
tation and worship? What is
needed to make this exercise a true
index of the religious life of the
university? To take away the re
proach which the university has
suffered, the lack of respect which
we must feel for ourselves because
of the pitiably small attention given
to this important university
exercise?"
The Ihiircrxily Record of Nov. 27
announces an entirely new plan
which may go into effect Nov. 80.
The chapel hour has been changed
from noon to 10:80 and the univer
sity divided into four groups. The
Junior Colleges are to meet on
Monday.the Senior Col leges on Tues
day, the Divinity School on Thurs
day, and the Craduate Schools on
Friday. Attendanee iscompu lsory.
Each student in the university is
therefore to be required to attend
morning chapel once a week.
