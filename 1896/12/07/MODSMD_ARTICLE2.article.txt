## 
### 
Charles E. Melkies died in San
Jose on October 19 of pulmonary
consumption. Mr. Melkies was a
student in the University in the
year 1893-94, and left during the
second semester of that year for
Arizona in the hope of recovering
from a bronchial trouble that
threatened to develop into con
sumption. He drifted about since
then from Los Angeles to San Fran
cisco, expecting in time to re-enter
the University, but gradually failed
in health until compelled to go to
the hospital, where he died. Mr.
Melkies was a native of Russia, and
was a bright student in English
and Economics, in which lines he
had planned his work.
