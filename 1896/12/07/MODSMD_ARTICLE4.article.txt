# The 						Freshman Glee.
## 
### 
The Century Class made its bow
to the social world of Stanford last
Friday night, in an enjoyable
though not largely attended dance.
The affair had been well arranged,
the floor committee did its work as
well as a freshman committee may
be expected to act, and the decor
ations, although meager, were taste
ful. On the whole the Freshman
(-'lass has a right to be proud of its
initial venture.
But the refreshments! There
was the rub. For the first time in
many a year a rival class worked
the often attempted "coup'' on the
refreshments. There had been dire
rumors all the afternoon of an ex
pected raid by the sophomores.
A strong guard had therefore been
placed over the larder, but by a
stratagem the sophomores drew off
the guard and the freshmen slaked
their thirst on lemonade alone.
Later in the evening the empty
freezer was returned with an appro
priate inscription.
