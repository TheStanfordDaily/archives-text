# The
						Ukiah Trip.
## 
### 
The members of the (Slee and
Mandolin Clubs returned to the
University Saturday night from
Ukiah, where they gave a concert
on the preceding evening. The con
cert was held in the Ukiah Opera
House, and a fair-sized audience as
sembled to hear it., although a series
of revival meetings held throughout
the town succeeded in keeping
many away. All the numbers on
the program met with a warm re
ception, nothing but favorable men
tion being made of the clubs. After
the entertainment the hall was
cleared fora dance, and the social
feature of the evening held sway un
til a late hour. The trip to Ukiah
proved a very tiresome one as far
as time wasconcerned. theclubs hav
ing to leave the University at 5 a.m.
and only arriving at their destina
tion by 1 p.m.; but they feel more
than repaid for the discomforts of
the trip by the warm and hospitable
reception given them by the people
of the town.
