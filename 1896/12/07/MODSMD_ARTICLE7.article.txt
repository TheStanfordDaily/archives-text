the University Club to the tennis
of the two universities. Those who
went from here were: Captain Fick
ert, Cotton, Seawright, Carle, Jack
lliee, Ray Smith, Manager Brown,
and Professors Allardice and Camp
bell. After the usual elaborate
menu of these occasions had been
served, speeches were made by the
two varsity captains and by several
of the hosts. Captain Fickert in a
brief speech complimented the
Berkeley men on their gritty play,

and thanked the club for bringing
about such a pleasant union of the
; two universities.
Captain Ransome of California
I spoke more at length. In speaking
jof the game he denied that there
| was any plausible excuse for Berke
ley's defeat. "We have no explan
ation. We were fairly outplayed,"
i said he.
In the course of the evening the
| club announced that it would offer
i a fine silver trophy cup to be com
! peted for by the baseball teams of
Stanford and Berkeley. The cup
I will become the property of which
ever varsity nine first wins two of
the three annual varsity games two
! vears in succession.
