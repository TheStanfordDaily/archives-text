# THE
						NORTHERN TRIP.
## The
						Undertaking Is Now An Assured Thing. 
### 
Arrangements are now practi
cally completed for the northern
t rip of the musical clubs. < )bstacles
which have been troubling the
clubs for weeks, have finally been
removed and the trip is certainly to
be undertaken. This decision was
arrived at this afternoon, after
thoroughly canvassing thesituation
and making allowances for the
difficulties which have recently
arisen. Hugh 11. Brown, 'Mi, as
advance agent, leaves tomorrow
morning to make final arrange
ments for the clubs' appearance in
the eleven towns which cotnpo.-e
the circuit of the trip. The names
of the towns together with the dates
of the concerts are as follows: Ta
cotna, Dec. 24; Seattle, Dec. 'Jo;
Victoria, B.C. Dec. 2ft; Vancouver,
B. C., Dec. 28; Portland, Dec. HO;
Oregon City, Dec.Bl; Salem, Jan. 1.
Leaving Salem, the clubs will play
in succession the towns of Eugene,
Chico, Marvsville, and Sacramento.
It is safe to say that no previous
trip attempted by the musical or
ganizations has been undertaken
under as favorable auspices as is
this one. In the first place, they
are going into a Stanford country,
where the University is exceedingly
well known, and where the people
are interested in all that concerns
our doings. In addition, our re
cent football victory has advertised
the University more than anything
else in that line could possibly have
done, and many people will he at
tracted to the entertainment by the
very name of Stanford. Further
more, what has always been an ob
stacle to the financial success of
former undertakings of this char
acter, and which was very much in
evidence on the Southern trip last
spring, namely, the lack of adver
tising, has been entirely done away
this time, and the appearance of
the clubs will be published and
well known in the different towns.
Manager Brown has done most ef
ficient. advance work, having occu
pied over a month's time in making
preliminary arrangements. He has
gotten out by far the largest amount
of advertising yet done on any such
tour on the Coast as regards qiiaii
tity, variety, and uniqueness. This
advertising has. been already
shipped to the various towns. It is
the intention, if possible, to provide
entertainment for the members of
the clubs in many of the cities,
which will result in a material re
duction in the expenses of the trip.
On Christmas day the organiza
tions are booked fora concert in
Seattle. On that day there is to be
a football game between the Mult
nomah Athletic Club and the
Seattle Athletic Club, and it is
probable that the entertainment in
the evening will be turned into a
musical-athletic affair. In Portland
the concert is to be given under the
auspices of the Stanford Club, and
will be followed probably by a
dance. In Eugene the Athletic
Club of the University of Oregon
will have the entertainment in
charge. The club is composed of
two hundred members, which fact
is a sufficient guarantee that the af
fair will be well patronized.

Taken all together there are at
present none hut the brightest pros
pects ahead of the trip, and it will
be a great surprise to those who :ire
in ii position to know if it is not a
financial success.
