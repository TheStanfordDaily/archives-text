It is an unfortunate fact that
morning chapel services at Stan
ford are more or less of a failure.
Either the services are not made
sufficiently interesting, or else the
students object to getting out so
early; at any rate the attendance is
always small and limited to certain
regular attendants.
It seems as though a vesper ser
vice, either weekly or bi-weekly,
might be a better plan than the
present one. Harvard has such a
service. It is made beautiful and
impressive and is largely attended
by both students and outsiders.
The plan is in operation in many
other large universities and is uni
formly successful. The idea is
worth a trial here.
