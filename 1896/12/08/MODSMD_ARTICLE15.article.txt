It is a matter of congratulation
to those interested in the welfare of
the University that there i* such a
strong feeling of loyalty and pa
triotism manifested by thegraduates
and former students of the Univer
sity. The fact that the graduates
and students of the University are
organizing cluhs for the purpose of
furthering the cause of their alma
mater in various regions, points out
the way in which Stanford is to
grow in the future through the loy
alty and devotion of the alumni.
Such cluhs also, besides furnishing
a means of spreading information
regarding the University, become a
powerful factor in binding together
all 'of the elements of the Universi
ty's influence in a certain locality,

and in causing them to act in har
mony and unity. Besides this they
form the basis of pleasanter and
more intimate relations between
those who have graduated in former
years and the undergraduates fresh
from the University. The old tra
ditions are not forgotten and the
latest news from college is eagerly
received by the graduates. It is a
pleasure to be able to add the Stan
ford Club of Jios Angeles to the list
already containing the Stanford
Clubs of Portland, Oregon, of San
Francisco, of Harvard, and of Co
lumbia.
