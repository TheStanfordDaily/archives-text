There seems to be an impression
among a number of students in the
University that, since the football
game and the vaudeville show, the
student body is greatly overbur
dened with surplus funds, and some
enterprising financiers seem to be
losing considerable sleep in consid
ering what to do with the surplus.
In the first place this "money to
burn" notion is wholly false. The
student body is not yet in such a
desirable state that speculations
may be entertained with regard to
the manner of disposing of a surplus.
It will require very close and very
careful financiering to reduce our
present debt to even one half its
present size.
The present season has been one
of the most expensive sinc-e football
has been an intercollegiate sport.
It has been the policy of the man
agement, and the results of the
game show it to have been a wise
one, to curtail in no way any ex
pense which would increase the
comfort or efficiency of the team.
A more expensive outing was given
the team, and better accommoda
tions in every way.
The student body is in much bet
ter condition financially than here
tofore, but it will be brought out of
debt only by the closest economy
and the best management.
