Editor Daily Palo Alto: The
report of the receipts from the
extravaganza was made this week
by manager Howell. It shows that
the total receipts were more than
$1,000; but since the expenses were
so great, only s|?L92 was turned into
the treasury of the athletic com
mittee.
The debate between the Hastings
Literary and Debating Society and
the Student's Congress last Wednes
day evening was won by the men
from Hastings. Quite an audience
was present and the contest proved
very spirited.
President Daniel Oilman of
Johns Hopkins has just presented
the university with an autograph
letter of Michael Reese, which was
written to Mr. Oilman while he
was president here, to announce his
gift to the library. It will be
framed and placed in a prominent
place in the library.
The different societies are very
quiet now as we are so near ex
aminations. The Political Science
Club and the botanical section of
the Science Association are the only
organizations which will hold meet
ings next week. The Science
Association has just issued tjuite
an extensive list of subjects for the
meetings which will he held after
the holidays.
A proposal has just been made
by a member of the senior class
that the faculty be petitioned to
set aside one hour from the reci
tation period each month to he
known as student hour. Meetings
of the Associated Students would be
held at that hour and all the mem
bers of the university could come
together on friendly footing. The
proposal will probably he con
sidered very soon and it is to be
hoped that some means will be
found by which we may be able to
get on more familiar terms with
•one a not her.
Quite a number of our students
•,ire planning to participate in foot
hall games in some function or
other during the holidays. The
members of the U. C. Yolo County
"Club have organized a team and
will play Woodland High School
on New Year's day. There is
evidently prospect, as is laughingly
said here, that still more defeats
may he added to our list for this
year. Thk Bkukklkyan.
