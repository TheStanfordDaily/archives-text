# Prof. Barnes' Southern Trip.
## 
### 
Prof. Earl Barnes was the only
Stanford professor who attended
the teachers' institutes held in
Southern California, while seven of
the Berkeley faculty, including
President Kellogg, represented U.C.
Besides the U. C. professors there
were several distinguished guests
from the East, among whom were
President Skinner, State Superin
tendent of Education in New York
and also president of the National
Educational Association of the
United States; W. N. Ilailman,
Commissioner of Indian Educa
tion; and A. E. Winship and Miss
Mera L. Pratt, who are all promi
nent in Eastern educational circles
and are making a tour of the Coast.
Prof. Barnes attended four teach
ers' institutes while in the South,
and delivered two papers before the
Southern California Teachers' Asso
ciation, which held a three days'
session in Los Angeles.
The meetings of the teachers
were enthusiastic and good work
was done. Prof. Barnes stated that
Stanford was regarded in the South
with the utmost good feeling, and
he believes that Stanford is acquir
ing a stronger foothold in that por
tion of the State.
While in Los Angeles Professor
Barnes attended a meeting of â™¦Stan
ford students and assisted in the
formation of a Stanford Club. He
also attended a banquet given by
the Schoolmasters' Club, at which a
Berkeley professor was asked to re
spond to the toast, "What did
Berkeley do on Thanksgiving day?"
Prof. Barnes says,"The great foot
ball victory made a splendid back
ing for work, and the 20 to 0 score
almost neutralized the 7 to 1 ad
vantage Berkeley had in professors."
