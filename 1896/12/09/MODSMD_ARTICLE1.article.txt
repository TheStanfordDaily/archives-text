# A 						TRIP TO THE SIERRAS.
## Tuesday Evening- Lecture by Prof. Brown. 
### 
Prof. Brown with aid of stereop
ticon views gave a most vivid de
scription last evening of his trip in
the Sierras this summer. He pre
faced his remarks with a short his
tory of the Sierra Club and its ob
ject. It was formed several years
ago for the purpose of exploring the
unknown regions of the Upper
Sierras. Willi this object in view
trails are now being made into the
country, maps and descriptions
published, and general interest
aroused regarding that beautiful
region
The party whose journey was de
scribed, visited the coulitrv around
the south fork of King's river.
Several peaks 1-1,000 feet in height
were climbed for the first time and
named by the ascenders. Stanford
Peak was named by Professor
Brown and University Peak by
Prof. I,e Oolite of Berkeley. A
number of little lakes also received
names well known amongst us, as
Castilleja Lake
Travelling in that region is an
arduous and often dangerous un
dertaking on account of the rocky
and steep mountain trails. But
the charm of the beautiful scenery
is a recompense quite sufficient for
an\' amount of labor and discom
fort. The region is a source of in
terest to the geologist on account of
the rock formations and the traces
nf glacial action shown by the shap
ing and marking of the mountains.
There is fine fishing to be had in
the rushing South Fork of King's
river and the forests along its banks
are an inducement to the hunter.
In short it is an ideal place to spend
a month or so in the summer in
exploring, hunting, and fishing.
