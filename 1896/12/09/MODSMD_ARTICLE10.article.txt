Thk series of piano recitals given
last week by Miss Ilia (}rittin closed
Friday afternoon and was an event
in the musical life of the Univer
sity. It is the first time we have
ever had a distinctively educational
series of concerts. Few persons
here had ever had the opportunity
of hearing an intelligent presenta
tion of the development of musical
forms, and it is safe to say that her
concerts formed a distinctive event
in the educational lives of all who
attended the series.
