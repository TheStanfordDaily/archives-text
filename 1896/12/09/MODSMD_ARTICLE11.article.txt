It is a source of great satisfaction
to most of us to know that the clubs
are going on their trip North. It
would seem that the fates are un
usually kind to our musicians this
year, for certainly n<> other trip has
shovvit so much of promise at the
outset. The University is very
proud uf her musical organizations,
and has every right to be, for few
organizations are superior to ours.
\\ ith the co-operation of the club
members as a backing and with
well-filled houses to look forward
to, there can be no result but suc
cess. We shall expect our Mando
lin and (ilee Clubs to represent
Stanford with credit in the country
of our friends.
