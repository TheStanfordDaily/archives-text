# What Football Defeat Means
## 
### 
The fact that some of ihe Yale
j undergraduates made some obser
vations when the Hoy Orator of
Salt Creek urbanely mentioned 11 it'
"ill-gotten gains" of their fathers
still rankles in the Bryanite bosom.
Thus our esteemed but happy con
temporary, the Butte Miner, emits
these bilious and revengeful senti
ments in regard to the defeat of Dr
Dwight's eleven by Dr. Pat ton's
eleven:
''Are there any tears in this vi
cinity over the defeat of the Yale
team? Are the people of Butte sit
ting up nights nursing their sor
row over the humiliation of the
sons of ftli? Do you hear any
heavy sobs in this vicinity over the
walloping of the pin-feathered
Alecks of New Haven? Well,
hardly. Yale is getting a part »>f
the medicine it has earned. Never
since the day when the students
disturbed the Bryan meeting and
made it impossible for the Demo
cratic candidate for the Presidency
to speak, has there been a friendly
feeling for the yowling vawps ot
Yale."
This is eminently courteous lan
guage, and no doubt the young gen
tlemen at New Haven will accept
the gentle rebuke and recognize in
their overthrow at football the ven
geance of the gods. Yet it must be
admitted that there is no tradition
of defeat at Yale; and next year the
Butte worshippers of juvenile elo
cution may have reason to believe
that the gods have short memories
and have given up avenging the
youthful prodigy. — New York Sun.
