The question of regulating the at
tendance of students at college ex
ercises has of recent years been a
source of considerable perplexity to
college authorities everywhere.
Fora good many years the "al
lowed absence" system has been in
use at Vale, and at Vale as else
where has been somewhat abused.
This year another system is being
made the subject of experiment
with the freshman class. The new
rule reads: "In general, absences
from class-room exercises and lack
of preparation will cause a deduc
tion from the student's standing in
scholarship, according to their na
ture and extent." The old system
of "making up" omitted exercises
is also abolished. It is argued in
favor of the new plan that a stu
dent in absenting himself actually
loses something which is rarely if
ever recovered by "making up," and
that lie will realize it better if the
loss appears just where it takes
place—in his scholarship.
