# Last of the Griffin Recitals.
## 
### 
Miss Ina Griffin closed lw-r series
of piano recitals in the develop
ment of the sonata last. Friday.
Miss Griffin's power as a pianist,
and her admirable presentation of
the subject-were so successful that
an effort is on foot to have such a
series repeated next semester. It, is
doubtful if any course dealing so
11rictly with classical themes can
ever be made a popular one in this
University, but for the few who
have high musical appreciation
such an opportunity is one which
comes too rarely to be neglected.
As for Miss Griffin's work, it is
worthy of all praise. Her playing,
outside its perfect style, is deeply
appreciative, and her comments on
ihe respective composers rank Miss
Griffin among the few musicians in
whom mental culture has kept pace
with the development of technique.
