# Harvard and Yale Making Up.
## 
### 
The lute muss-meeting, sit which
practically all the "S'n 1 e students
voted to resume athletic relations
with Harvard, was only one indica
tion of a general sentiment toward
reconciliation in hotli universities.
Two years' suspension of athletic
ivalry hÂ«,s wrought a great change
in the feelings of the two univer
sities; the men who caused the
trouble have now for the most part
left college, and Vale and Harvard
are old friends as well as famous
rivals. The managers of nil varsity
teams on both sides favor reconcili
ation, and with this feeling there is
nothing to prevent the patching up
of the difficulty. Of the two, Vale
seems the more anxious for the pro
posed move.
It is impossible to predict any
thing regardiifg the terms of recon
ciliation, but a limited agreement
lor a certain number of years is the
expected thing. At any rate, there
will in all probability be a Spring
field game next fall.
