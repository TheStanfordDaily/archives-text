Two leading artists who accom
pany Miss Ellen Beach Yaw, the
phenomenal soprano, are Miss
Georgiella Lay, pianiste, and Max
imilian Dick, violinist.
Miss Lay is a young American
girl whose star has been in the as
cendancy the past year. tShc is a
true artist, possessing sou! and tire,
which under the most exacting
criticism will place her high up on
the scroll of fame. As a soloist she
lias few rivals; as an accompanist

j she it? unexcelled. Following are
i some press comments:
Those who attended the piano
i recital given by Miss Lay lasteven
ing were certainly well repaid for
doing so. Miss Lay, besides being
a fine performer, iias rare attain
ments in the art of music, and the
perhaps rarer attainment of being
able in uutechnical language to in
terest an audience in the theory and
structure of musical composition.
—Chicago Inter-Ocean.
Miss Lay is a charming pianist
whose slight physique gives little
suggestion nf the force of her touch,
particularly in heavy chords and
passages. Her playing is notice
able for refinement, musical quality
(especially melodiousness), and in
telligence.—Chicago Tribune.
Miss Lay's Chopin work cap
tivated the audience. Her execu
tion is finished, and her playing
deserves special mention. _ More
than the usual appreciation /ac
corded a pianist was given her
work.— Kansas City Time*.
The most artistic feature of the
concert was the piano playing of
Miss Georgiella Lay, who was ob
liged to play a recall number after
her elegant performance of Liszt's
Tarantelle. Her second number
was even more important, the
Chopin Hondo in E fiat. This she
played in an extremely finished
manner, with much repose as well
as fire. — Chicago News.
Miss Lay's solos were faultlessly
rendered, and evoked much ap
plause.—Omaha lire.
Mr. Dick the violinist was born
in Minnesota in 1871. He began
his musical education under the
tuition of his mother and uncle,
who both were atone time pupils of
the great YVieniawski. At the age
of nine he began his public career
with such great success that he
was sent to Europe to complete his
education under the tutorship of
Professors Sitt and Hermann in
Leipsic. Critics often make note
of Mr. Dick's style of playing as
being so much like Remenvi's, but
that he is a much greater artist.
Concerning him we clip the follow
ing:
Mr. Dick is an accomplished
artist who never fails to awaken
the enthusiasm of all who are
fortunate enough to listen to him.
When he played in concert at the
Metropolitan Opera House his solo
was so favorably received that he
was recalled four times. —New York
Musical Courier.
Another young artist who lays
claims to a brilliant future is Mr.
Maximilian Dick the violinist. He
easily overcame the greatest tech
nical difficulties and played witn
such artistic depth that he won the
admiration of the whole audience
and was forced to respond to an
enthusiastic encore. — New York
Sun.
Rarely has so young a violinist
aroused such genuine enthusiasm
as Mr. Dick by his performance of
the ''Scherzo Fantastique" by
Bazzini. His technique and style
are of so high an order than he can
easily be compared with the best
artists of this country. — New York
Times.
Mr. Dick surpassed himself last
evening. His numbers included
compositions from Wieniawski,

Sauret, De Beriot, and other
standard composers, and in each
he adapted himself to the spirit and
the technical difficulties with the
ease of a great artist. —Kansas City
Journal.
