The baseball men of the Univer
sity are agitating the matter of pro
curing a coach for the baseball
team. The announcement of the
trophy to be awarded by the Uni
versity Club of San Francisco to
the team victorious two out of three
years has already caused consider
able interest to be taken in our
prospects for the season of' 97. Mr.
Lange proved so satisfactory last
season as a coach that the baseball
management is very desirous of
securing his services again this
year. It is early in the season but
the management feel that it will be
necessary to secure Mr. Lange's
services before he is otherwise en
gaged. Accordingly the matter will
be brought before the Executive
Committee tomorrow evening and
the proposition will receive their
attention. It seems to be the
general impression, however, that
no definite action can be taken
until the exact state of the student
body finances can be ascertained,
which will probably he not until
next semester.
