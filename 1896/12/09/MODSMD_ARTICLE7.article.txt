### 
President Chas. Thwing again
contributes, in tlie December Fo
rum, to the great college problems
of the day, in a paper entitled
' The drawbacks of a college educa
tion."
In this article he seeks to present,
the strongest arguments of the op
ponents to college education.
The first of these is that the col
lege fosters a spirit of laziness, the
habit of doing only the pleasant;
that, it does not make the student
do a. proper amount of work, and
allows him to slip through with
very little study, with the result
that four years of such life makes
it difficult for'him to do hard work
later on in his career.
The second drawback is that the
judgment is trained at the expense
of his energy. As he is able to sen
the difficulties of the undertaking
he hesitates to begin the task.
It is urged as another drawback
that the time spent in getting a. col
lege education removes him from
the most favorable opportunities of
learning business. These are the
most valuable years of his life, and
he is obliged to begin a work at an
age past twenty-one that might
have been begun several years
earlier.
It is also urged that the college
fills the mind with useless knowl
edge and trains it in antiquated
methods of thought and action, and
furthermore, that it trains individ
uality, but not social efficiency.
In reply to the first objection,
that it fosters a spirit of laziness.
President Thwing urges that the
college should require the student
to take those studies which }'ield
the richest educational results.
As to the second drawback, that
the judgment is trained at the ex
pense of energy, he cites the fact
that some of the greatest construc
tive works of modern times have
been the triumphs of college men.
In respect to the disadvantage
under which the college graduate
labors in entering business, he
shows that it is being answered by
the power and success of the college
man in business.
As to the fourth objection, he
shows that a training in Latin and
Greek is of the greatest worth, lie
says that the scientific school is a
profession;! 1 school, and not a school
of general training The value of
this training is recognized by the
heads of the best technical and sei
entilic schools, many of whom have
urged that a student should take ;i
general college course before enter
ing the professional school.
In closing, the writer declares
that the American colleges set be
fore themselves the highest ideals,
and it rests upon the promoters to
make them a more vital and more
vigorous part of American life.
