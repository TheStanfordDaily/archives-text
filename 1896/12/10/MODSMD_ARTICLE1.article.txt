# The 						Election Tomorrow.
## 
### 
The election for editor-in-chief of
the Daily Palo Alto will take
place as announced tomorrow.
Every registered student has the
privilege of casting a vote, and it is
hoped that as many as possible
will avail themselves of the oppor
tunity. The importance of the
place to he filled demands that more
than general interest should he
taken in the election.
The polls will open at 11:15 in
the morning, so as to allow those
who have to catch the noon train
for San Jose a chance to vote. They
will close at '2:80 p.m.
As many students as possible
should vote during and at the
close of the fourth hour, so as to
avoid the rush in the afternoon.
All the buses for Palo Alto and
Maylield at noon will be held until
12:45 to enable this to lie done.
