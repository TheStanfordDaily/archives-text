There is no doubt that the
American public generally is grad
ually getting over the "athletic
craze," particularly as it relates to
college athletics. The American
people have a habit of taking up a
new thing, especially if it is ;i good
thing, and "running it into the
ground." The camera craze, the
X-ray craze, the bicycle craze—we
do not have to go down the long
list. The athletic craze has been
the greatest, lasting as it has
through a number of years and em
bracing a number of the minor
fads.
The wave is receding; or rather,
as h;is been the case with the other
epidemics, people have simply
gotten used to the new thing, have
accepted it, and have taken it as a
niiitter of course. When cheap
cameras came into general use the
newspapers went wild on the sub
ject; then the public got acquainted

with the camera iiencl and ceased
talking of him, yet the use of the
camera litis been steadily increas
ing.
Interest in athletics has fol
lowed the general rule. The time
is past when papers will devote
four pages to an intercollegiate
game and a half column to the
founding of a professorship. But
there is every reason to believe that
the era of sane and substantial ath
letics —athletics used moderately as
a part of education —is coining
about with the death of the craze.
We have merely stopped talking
and gone to work.
