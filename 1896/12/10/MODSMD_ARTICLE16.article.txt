The next two meetings of the
University Christian Association
seem likely to be of unusual in
terest. Next Sunday evening the
meeting will be addressed by Rev.
H. \V. Brayton, State Superintend
ent of the Childrens' Home Find
ing Society. This is a non-sectarian
organization, working in the in
terest of the homeless children of
California, finding for them suit
able homes throughout the state.
The work and its representative are
worthy of our intelligent interest
and sympathy, and it is to broaden
our sympathies and interests that
this opportunity to hear Mr. Hrav
ton has been arranged. No col
lections or subscriptions will be
taken at the meeting.
The following Sunday evening,
the 20th, the association is arrang
ing to offer a Christmas musical
service that none can afford to miss
without good reason. Some of the
best musical talent about the Uni
versity will assist, and a beautiful
service, suitable to the Christmas
season, is assured. Both these
meetings should be kept in mind
and well attended.
