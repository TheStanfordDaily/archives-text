# Cribbing at Harvard.
## 
### 
The faculty of Harvard Univer
sity has announced its intention to
separate from the college students
handing in written work not their
own, and to post their names on j
the college bullentin boards. The,
offence thus to he dealt with is
familiarly known as ''cribbing."
The Harvard faculty has deter-j
mined and announced that it is
dishonorable, and merits public
expulsion. The conclusion thus
reached is somewhat revolutionary,'
and the action taken has only been
taken with reluctance, and after j
solemn thought and full discussion.
In old times at Harvard, as in
most other colleges where what is
known as the "honor system" in
examinations does not prevail,
cribbing was not regarded as dis
honorable, though its expediency
has always been freely questioned,
even by the patrons of the practice.
It, used to he the custom, when
written examinations were held, to
garrison the examination-rooms
with proctors, who patrolled the
aisles, and made it their business
to restrain as far as possible the
propensity of the examined to
cheat. The result was that it was
regarded as a fair game to beat the
examiners, and students of honor
able character often used what fur
tive aids they might to eke out
their halting scholarship. Only
when the examinations were in
some degree competitive, as where
students were trying for high rank
or for scholarships, was cribbing
felt to involve dishonor. But con
ditions are decla red to ha ve changed
at Harvard. The relations be
tween instructors and students are
more familiar than they used to be,
and the majority of the students
are believed to take their work
more seriously than they once did,
and to look upon their instructors
more as fountains of information
and less as hindrances to ease.
The faculty feels that there are
certain childish things that ought
to lie put away from Harvard for
ever, and cribbing is one of tlieni.
Hence this severe penalty for an
offense which, it seems, is still very
prevalent among the more frivolous
undergraduates.
It will be interesting to know
how this new rule works. The fac
ulty may expel students caught
cribbing, hut it can not make an
act dishonorable hy proclaiming it
to be so. The body thai settles
what is deemed honorable and
what is not in a college is the un
dergraduates. A faculty may dis
miss but it can not disgrace a man.
His appeal is to his fellows, and
unless they concur in the judgment
the man is not disgraced. Never
theless, cribbing is a malodorous
practice, and expulsion is a.grave
penalty, and a lad expelled from
college for cribbing will have to
make many more explanations
than he cares to if he would demon
strate that he is not unfit to be
trusted. Even if he can convince
his friends that in general concerns
he is not a cheat, he will still find
it difficult to disperse the suspicion
that he is lacking in sound sense.
If the penalty for cribbing at Har
vard is to be so severe, it would
seem that cribbing will not pay.
If the jury trial system prevailed
at Harvard, it might turn out that
the punishment was so dispropor
tionate to the crime that the law
could not lie enforced; but since the
faculty is judge, jury, and sheriff,
the new rule may be expected to
work, and ought to help the situ
ation. —Jin Weekly.
