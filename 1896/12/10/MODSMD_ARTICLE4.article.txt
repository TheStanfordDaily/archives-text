# Pythianism at College.
## 
### 
The possible nucleus of a new
departure in college life was estab
lished last night at Palo Alto,
where Grand Master Schaftner of
San Francisco addressed a gather
ing of students and citizens of Palo
Alto on 'The history and principles
of Pythianisni."
Short addresses were also deliv
ered by Grand Keeeper of Records
and Seal, Major McGlashen of
Truekee, District Deputy Grand
Chancellor F. I>. Donahoo of San
Jose, Past Chancellor H. 11. John
son of San .lose, and \ . \ . Clark,
'98. There are already among the
faculty, students, and citizens of
I'alo Alto a sufficient number of
Knights of Pythias to insure the
successful organization of a subor
dinate lodge. Hut it is desired to
draw upon the student body fora
large membership.

Regarding the difference between
Pythianism and our local frater
nities, Grand Chancellor Schaftner
said:
"You must not confound the
Pythian cause with your local
college secret societies, because they
differ widely. No doubt there is a
. mutual benefit obtained by the stu
i dents forming into clubs and living
! together. Co-operation is the order
of the day. Hut when a college
' man graduates and goes out into
; the world, his college fraternity is
not of much further value to him.
On the other hand, Pythianism has
lessons to teach. Any perton of
reasonable intelligence can easily
learn these lessons and profit there
by. The principal lesson taught is
that friendship is the prime essen
tial to human progress. Without
friendship the human race will fall;
j with it, all is harmony. It may
therefore be called an order of
friends. l>ul there are many other
principles taught that may be
j learned by the rising young man
J with personal value. They will
| guide him in his social life, in fact
j throughout his whole career. Our
I creed is simple; we believe in a
! Deity. Our secrets are not dark
land mysterious. They consist, like
j those of other orders, of grips, signs,
and passwords, and the ritualistic.
! work. Our aim is to elevate nian
i kind. If a young man is so trained
| during his college career, will not
his after life be influenced by it ?
| Certainly yes.
j "I hope ere long to see a thriving
j lodge established at this UDiversity,
|in which students will be the
I staunch supporters and advocates
j of the grand principles of Pythian
ism."
If all students who are interested
in the new movement will send
their names to Y. V. Clark, box
j 101, Palo Alto, a petition will he
drawn up and circulated immedi
ately.
