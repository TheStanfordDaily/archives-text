# Ethics in Engineering.
## 
### 
Mr. Itandail Hunt lectured here
last evening upon ''Ethics in En
jgineering." Although the lecture
was short it amply showed the
I speaker's high estimation of engi
neering as a profession. In speak
ing of engineers as a class he said,
briefly: ''Engineers have to pass
through the same prejudices against
which lawyers and physicians had
to struggle in ancient times. It is
'nevertheless a profession of the
highest order and one of which no
, one need be ashamed. Here are a
i few rules which I give you for what
they are worth as the product of ex
perience: never run down another
I man's work Good execution will
do its own talking. In my estima
tion, every engineer should have a
j general college course of some ex
tent in addition to his special train
; ing. No workman should call him
self a real engineer until he has had
! several years of actual experience.
] On account of his arduous duties,
often at peculiar hours, he is iso
lated to a large extent from ordi
nary life and from its frivolities.
His work is to make the masses
comfortable, for he is called to work
in the great centers of population
as well as in the sparsely settled
regions. His work lies where the
interests of the masses lie."
