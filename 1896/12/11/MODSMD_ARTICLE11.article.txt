While at first thought some may
he prone to criticise the Executive
Committee for its action last night
in failing to appropriate money for
the securing of a baseball coach,
soher second thought must give the
members of that committee credit
for having taken the only action
open to them at the present time.
As far as precedent is concerned
there was no special reason for hir
ing a coach at student body ex
pense. It was a question only as to
the feasibility of setting a precedent
this year. The desirability of get
ting a coach for the baseball men is
beyond all doubt much greater this
year than heretofore, on account of
the cup recently offered by the Uni
versity Club and the increased in
terest sure to be taken in baseball
after that offer. But after all, there
is probably a greater consideration
for us to bear in mind at present,
and that is the desirability of get
ting the Associated Students out of
debt.
Few persons except those held
directly responsible for the student
body finances realize the enormity
of our present, debt and what it
means to the University. So long
as business men know that they
run the risk of waiting several
months fur the payment of their
bills against the Associated Stu
dents, those bills will naturally be
larger than they otherwise would
be. The advantages of putting
our finances on a, sound basis
should be apparent to all. We be
lieve that this year's management
is doing all in its power to make it
possible for next year's business to
be done on a cash basis. Its ef
forts will be useless, however, unless
they receive the support of the stu
dents at large. This support should
not be lacking.
