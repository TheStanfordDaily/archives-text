Something over a year ago this
paper and the Berkeleyan decided;
by mutual consent to cease from all
intercollegiate newspaper "scraps" j
as unworthy of journals represent
ing the students of two dignified;
universities. Since then the twoj
papers in question have, we believe, i
been entirely free from antagonisms .
of any kind. Occasionally one or t
the other has been called upon to]
make a criticism or to correct an j
error, but it has ever been done in j
the kindliest spirit. Certainly the |
Berkeleyan has never given us reason
to complain in ibis respect.
For this reason we have long hes
itated about touching on the atti
tude assumed by the other U. C.
journal, the Occident; but the con
tinued hostility of that paper to
ward Stanford and all things which
pertain thereunto has gone so far
that a protest has become abso
lutely necessary. There is no
newspaper rumor so absurd that
the Occident does not give it credence
if only it reflects on Stanford; there
is no Stanford "rooter" so wildly
enthusiastic that his words do not
obtain currency in its columns.
Since the opening of college this
fall there has not been an issue of
that paper which has not contained
some venomous drive at Stanford
institutions, athletics being the par
ticular mark of the prize satirist.
Gentlemen of the Occident, this
sort of thing is backwoods journal
ism; it dates to the time of log
school-houses and hand-presses.
There are other things with which
to fill your columns besides alleged
sarcasm aimed at Stanford. Such
things lower the reputation of your
university abroad, and we feel
bound to protest, even though the
combined Occident staff, from the
athletic reporter down to "Cato,"
pours out its genius upon us in a
Hood of crushing sarcasm.
