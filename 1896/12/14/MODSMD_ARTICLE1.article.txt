# Sunday Sermon.

The sermon yesterday morning
was delivered by Rev. C. E. Walk
of San Francisco on the subject,
t'The function of the church of to
day." The text was taken from
St. Luke xv, 1,2. The services were
those of the Episcopalian church.
The Rev. Mr. Walk said that the
study of church function is one
which most properly concerns those
university students whose work is
in the sciences. In this study a
broad interpretation of the word
''church" is used. By it we mean
all the believers of Christ, who real
ize that it is their nearest duty as
a church and as individuals to save
those whom they see going wrong.
This universal church must ever
put Christ to the front and make
him appear as the one altogether
lovely. The whole membership
must work as one church, not afraid
to approach the sinner, because
Christ was not. The church is bis
representative on earth, and when
it realizes its ideal it will draw sin
ners as lie did.
The duty of the church is to
pleach the gospel and receive sin
ners. If it does this, Christ will
take care of its reputation. If it
fails in this it. encumbers the earth
and has no right to exist, for it is
failing in its highest mission.
The church is coming more to
realize the wide gap between itself
and the masses. There must be a
reason for this. We see Christ
himself attracting the classes that
the church, His representative, does
not hear. Where the masses heard
Christ gladly they do not hear us
at all. Why this separation? The
churches have come to consist al
most entirely of the cultured.
There are more churches now than
ever before and more money spent
on them. Yet churches are dead;
whv? Because we do not give our
selves to Christ through the masses
~112 the ueople. For every city mis
sionary there is, let there be a
thousand. Let the rich and cul
tured undertake work among the
poor, and it will not be long before
tin re will be crowds knocking for
admission to the churches. It, is
the part of every true church man
and woman to greet his fellows
with gentle words, a smile, and a
shake of the hand. This work can
not be done by proxy. Each indi
vidual must work for the collective
result.
The mission of ihe church is the
noblest of all. I do not hesitate to
urge the performance of Christian
duty upon the rich and cultured as
the greatest credential of happiness
in the world.
