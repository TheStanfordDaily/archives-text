# California's Track Coach.

### 
Berkeley has been exerting every
effort to secure the services of J. V.
Crum, the great sprinter, as her
coach for the field-day next spring.
Everything at present points to
success, and Crum will probably be
seen at Berkeley early in January,
lie will doubtless do much to im
prove the work of Berkeley's
sprinters.
