pion of the Pacific Coast gridiron is
again agitating foot hull circles.
Olympic persists in claiming the
honor, and at least demands the
right of playing a decisive game
with the Varsity. According to the
original agreement there is no douht
that we are the champions, and it
is optional with ns whether we give
the athletic cluh men another show
at the championship. The eleven
has been out of training and prac
tice for three weeks and could not
play the game they did on Thanks
giving day, while the Olympics have
kept in touch with the game in an
ticipation of the contest, which it
seems likely will he arranged. The
game would doubtless be one of
great interest and should attract a
large crowd, but it is not good pol
icy for Stanford to play with the
understanding that the game is to
decide the championship that she
already holds, even though she were
assured of winning.
