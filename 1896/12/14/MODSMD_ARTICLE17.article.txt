Tttk late action of Chicago
University in restoring to favor
compulsory chapel is causing a re
vival of the question of religious
services as a university exercise.
There are many opinions pro and
con, from the orthodox view pre
sented in the present issue to the
agnostic opinion. Neither is it, as
might he supposed, entirely are

ligious question. The meeting of all
the students once a day was a
tremendous force tending toward
college feeling in the colleges and
universities thirty years ago, and
a revival of this feeling is a main
object of compulsory chapel.
We nre far from advocating such
an institution here, hut can not
something he done to make our own
chapel services more attractive with
a view to increasing the attend
ance? We are certain that the
score of persons who daily gather
before the first hour recitation do
not represent the religious element
in the University, and that the
fault is in the way the exercise is
carried on rather than in the feel
ing of the student body. Vesper
services would be one solution, but
this plan may not be practicable;
and an awakening interest in the
morning services would seem to be
the necessary thing at present.
