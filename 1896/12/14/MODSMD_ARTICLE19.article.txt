# As to Compulsory Chapel.
## 
### 
As showing the orthodox view of
the question, at present pressing,
of compulsory chapel, we quote the
following from the Christian futcUi
tjencer:
''There has heen for some time ;i
tendency in colleges to make attend
ance on religious services volun
tary, and hence the experience of
those institutions which have tried
the experiment is valuable. The
contention of those who favor the
continuation of the time-honored
custom of compulsory attendance
has heen that with the temptations
which surround the college student
and which lead him to abuse the
liberty exemption from home re
straint offers, the morning chapel
and Sunday service are certain to
be more and more neglected unless
they be made obligatory. This
will result less from a determined
intention of absenteeism than from
a thoughtless and gradual yielding
to what seem more pressing claims.
This view has received repeated
confirmation where the voluntary
system has been tried. The latest
deliverance on this subject conies
from President Harper of the Chi
cago University. He says: 'Is it
that the religious service lias been
dull and uninteresting? Vet it is
true that the men who have con
ducted it have been the strongest
men on the university staff and the
strongest men in the pulpits of the
city of Chicago. Is it that sufficient
effort has not been put forth to in
duce the students to attend? Ef
fort after effort has been made wit h
out avail. Is it that the chapel
service is a thing of the past and
no longer needed in a university?
If this is true, prayer itself is a
farce and religion is a delusion.
Is it.after all, that in student life
as in every other life, there is needed
in the performance of many of the
higher duties a sense of obligation
coming either from without or with
in? And is it, possible that the
policy of required attendance is
perhaps better?' The Ch rixtia n
I nti'lliijcnrcr has no hesitancy in
saying t hat it is."
