# The 						Yaw Concert.
## 
### 
On Friday evening the much
heralded Ellen Beach Vuw dis
played her wonderful voice to ilie
music lovers of the University. A
small crowd was gathered to hear
her—on the inside. Outside there
were, hy actual count, 14(i. This
a rra ngement would ha ve l>een liar in
fill only to the student hody
treasury had the outsiders acted
like gentlemen, hut they conducted
themselves like hoodlums, to the
discomfiture of the musicians.
Something must lie done and done
immediately to prevent a repetition
of this occurence if we ever expect

musicians of reputation to visit
Stanford.
Miss Yaw was enthusiastically
received, her numbers being en
cored again and again. She un
doubtedly has a wonderful voice.
The Yaw range is too famous to re
quire comment here; the voice is
beyond all imagination and is, in
addition, under wonderful control.
As an artist, however, she can not
be praised so highly. She was
only moderately successful in the
love songs and she failed to put
any dramatic power in the passion
ate number from 'Ml Traviata."
It is the instrument, not Ibe artist,
that one admires in her work. She
wits more successful in the latter
and more playful passages. Au
brey's ''Laughing Song" which she
gave as an encore was the best ren
dered of these.
Miss Lay is a conscientious
pianist and a thorough mistress of
technique. Mr. Dick's work was,
from an artistic point of view, much
the superior of the company's star.
His playing has much the same
character as Remenyi's, but his in
tellectual appreciation is far higher.
