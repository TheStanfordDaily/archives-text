# Olympic-Stanford.
## 
### 
In spite of the fact that Stanford's
claim to the Coast championship is

probably just, there is a chance
that Stanford and Olympic may
meet Christmas day for definite
settlement of the question of su
premacy. Our athletes take this
step partly from a desire to place
the title to the championship be
yond all question of doubt and
partly to help clear off the eternal
student body debt. A majority of
the football men are not in favor of
playing the game, and Captain
Fickert himself is not enthusiastic
over it.
The eleven of Minnesota Uni
versity planned fora Western trip
and asked fora game with our Var
sity. The request was granted and
the game was to he played Christ
mas, but word was received Satur
day that the trip had been declared
off for the present. If Minnesota
does decide to come to the Coast a
game with the Stanford eleven
would be a contest of great interest.
Minnesota has been beaten but
once this year, and Stanford but
once. Arrangements may be made
for the Northerners to come.
