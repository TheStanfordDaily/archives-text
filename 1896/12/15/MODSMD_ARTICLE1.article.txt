# No Game With Olympic.
## 
### 
The football management has
practically decided that there will
be no game with the Olympic
Athletic Club's football eleven on
Christmas or New Year's day.
Several of the members of the
Varsity intend to go home for the
Christmas holidays, and the team
would be consequently very much
weakened. Manager Brown stated
today that in all probability no
game would be played with Olym
pic. <- The championship trophy
also will be given to Stanford with
out any doubt." Captain Fickert
also said, in regard to the proposed
game, that it would not, in his
opinion, be played. President
Pomeroy also was of the same
opinion.
The sentiment among the men
seems to be against playing the
game. They are busily engaged in
study at present, and are much
averse to resuming their canvas
suits and chasing the pig-skin, al
though they are very confident they
could win another Stanford victory.
The trophy will be awarded us, and
the men see no reason to play.
