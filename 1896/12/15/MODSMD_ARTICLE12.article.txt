Papers are being passed around
today to secure subscriptions fora
coach for the baseball team. As
the Executive Committee of the As
sociated Students lias decided Unit
it can not see its way clear to hire
a coach this year, the subscription
method is the only means left by
which we can secure the services of
that much needed personage. It
only remains to be seen how much
money can be raised by this method,
but there is little occasion to doubt
but that the same liberality will be
shown as was manifested in a like
cause by the students last year.
