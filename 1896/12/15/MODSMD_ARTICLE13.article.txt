From all indications the trip of
the musical organizations is not
yet an assured go. The advance
agent is meeting with good success
up North, but it is here at the Uni
versity that the hitch occurs. After
all arrangements have been com
pleted, some of the members have
learned that they will not, for vari
ous reasons, be allowed to goon the
tour. This action has placed the
clubs in a very embarassing and
difficult position, for they have al
ready perfected final arrange
ments for the trip, and are only
waiting for the holidays to start.
To make matters worse, those who
will be unable to make the trip are
the ones who are indispensable to
the work of the clubs. Just what
the outcome will be it is difficult to
predict.
