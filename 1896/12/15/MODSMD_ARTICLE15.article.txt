Mr. Lehman n, the Leander and
Oxford coach, returns to England
from his work at Harvard this
week. His presence at Harvard
has caused an unparalleled revival
in rowing interests. During the
time of his sojourn the crew candi
dates have been in strict training
and most of the coaches and varsity
men have mastered the English
stroke. Last week two picked
crews raced over a two-mile course
in excellent time, and at the con
clusion of the race a provisional
varsity eight was chosen. Mr.
Lehmnnn has converted most of the
Harvard advisers to English views
on stroke.
