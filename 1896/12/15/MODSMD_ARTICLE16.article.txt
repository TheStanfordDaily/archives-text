# The 						December Bachelor of Arts.

### 
The Bachelor of Arts comes to us
this month with brilliant red and
gold covers, and with ahostof good
things between them. This mag
azine is coining rapidly to the
front among publications devoted
to universities and university life;
it has passed the experimental
stage and can look well forward to
a long life of usefulness.
This month the Bachelor of Arts
has taken a departure which is sure
to create a commotion in American
universities. It is no iess than an
attack on football as played at pres
ent in American colleges. First,
there is a sarcastic little article,
u Football as the coachers see it," by
.Jesse Lynch Williams, and then
the whole department of athletics is
taken up with a severe arraignment
of the modern game. That it is
dangerous, and that it is too hard
training even when it does not
maim, is the opinion of the writer,
lie admits, however, that the game
is a good one, only that it needs re
forming.- These are the reforms he
suggests:
First: No one shall he admitted
to a college team who weighs more
than 160 pounds. Second: Strin
gent rules preventing hard tackling.
Third: .Stringent rules against all
sorts of massed play. Fourth: An
establishment of a rule that if any
player at any time of the season is
injured, so that in the opinion of a
physician he is not able to play
the day following, he shall be put
off the team for that season. Fifth:
No member of a team shall be
allowed to wear nails, spikes, or
iron braces of any sort on his shoes
(we understand this rule pretends
to be in force). Sixth: A suitable
uniform, to be agreed upon by all
colleges, must be worn by every
member of a team, which will serve
more fully to protect ankles, legs,
knees, and ribs of the players.
Seventh: livery player must wear
a leather-cushioned hood covering
hi> entire head, leaving exposed
bis eyes and nose, which latter
shall be protected by a rubber as
now in use.
The Bachelor of Arts probably
takes this ground in all sincerity,
but we <1 read to think of the row
which will surely follow this blow
at the idol of the American student.
The ediloral page closes with a
little greeting to the papers and
magazines of the American uni
versities:
"We have not the space to allude
to each and all of you bright,
news)', well-printed college papers;
but y<iu are representative of every
thing that American university
li fe engendersâ€”honesty, cleanliness,
cleverness, and giving us elders
good proof that those that come
after us are well worthy to follow
in our footsteps.
"You are published without fac
ulty interference, and you are really
representative of student pluck and
brains. We say it with careful
consideration, that nothing shows
the results of our American demo
cratic institutions better than our
youthful college press. The work
is well done, thoughtful, manly,
clean. Really it is surprising how
much better written are our college
exchanges tban many of our older
'esteemed couteinpora ries.'"
