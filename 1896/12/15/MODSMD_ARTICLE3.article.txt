# Sword and Sandals.

### 
Sword anil Sandals met this
afternoon to discuss plans for the
entertainment to he given next
semester for the benefit of the '!)<S
annual. The choosing of a play
of recognised merit and one at the
same time suited to production hy
our amateurs has for some time
heen a vexed question with Sword
and Sandals. The selection made
was an amhitious one; the club will
attempt Goldsmith's ''She Stoops
to Conquer."
While this play is an English
classic, it is for amateurs one of the
easiest of the standard plays, and
it is a comedy which should appeal
to all classes in our varied student
population. We have, besides, as
much good dramatic material in
the University as ever, and some of
our amateurs are especially fitted
for parts in this play. For these
reasons "She Stoops to Conquer"
was chosen. It is certainly an am
bitious attempt, but there will be
all the more glory in it if it suc
ceeds. Casts will be announced
this week and rehearsals begun
early next semester.
