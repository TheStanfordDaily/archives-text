Editor Daily Palo Alto: At a
meeting of the members of the Co-

Operative Association last May the
opinion was expressed, without a
dissenting voice, that the system
under which the University hook
store is managed needed revision.
Two of its evils, viz.: the voting of
proxies of members no longer in
the University, and the holding of
more than one vote by a single per
son, were at that time in striking
evidence. The circumstances of
the case made it impossible for
anything to he done at that time,
but no one doubted that before
another election the needed reform
would he brought about. As yet,
however, nothing has been done.
Unless action is taken very soon,
the chance of the Association work
ing out its own salvation this year
will be lost. The candidates for
the managership for next year can
reasonably be expected to begin
their canvass e oon, and all these
after having gotten their campaign
under way will naturally be op
posed to any attempt to change tlie
existing order of things.
Meanwhile the reasons forchange
are ;is potent as ever. Of the two
eviis exhibited hist spring, one—
tlie voting of proxies of outside
members—will undoubtedly con
tinue as long as the possibility for
it exists. Besides this the man
agement under the present organi
zation has never been fully satis
factory. The system of accounting
is not rigid enough. There is no
guarantee of sufficient continuity
in the management to insure ef
ficiency; and it is very generally
believed that ilie prices have not
been as low as they might have
been under a better organization.
The fact that a considerable num
ber of the professors order the books
for their classes directly from the
East themselves is a practical
proof of the need for reform.
It is probable that when there are
no special interests to be antago
nized no opposition will arise
against a movement to so amend
the by-laws as to accomplish the de
sired result (if such amendment
can he made legally), or to dissolve
the present corporation and reor
ganize it a» a co-operative associa
tion under the amendment to the
Civil Code passed in 1895, or to
adopt any other method which may
seem practicable. The sentiment
expressed last spring would inti
mate that such is the case; and we
can reasonably hold no other be
lief. It is the sole purpose of this
communication to start a move
ment which will result in the
changes necessary to secure a Uni
versity bookstore under an efficient
system of management that will
furnish supplies cheaply and that
will not at least offer any special
temptation for questionable meth
ods in student body polities.
With this object in view the un
dersigned members of the Co-opera
tive Association request that the
board of directors call an informal
meeting of the members who are
in the University to devise a plan
to bring about the needed chances.
