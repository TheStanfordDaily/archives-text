Hugh H. Brown, '9(>, who is
making final arrangements for the
musical clubs' Northern trip, has
encountered no serious obstacles.
The towns he has thus far visited
seem to be entnusiastic over the
prospect of hearing the clubs, and
this would seem to prophesy no
Fresno frosts.
Mr. Brown left San Francisco on
December 11, after making ar
rangements for shipping his adver
tising matter before him. After
making a thorough canvass of
Stockton he found that the U. C.
musical clubs had made a date at
Stockton, and that no satisfactory
one could be secured without com
ing in contact with strong counter
attractions.
Mr. Brown spent the 12th in Sac
ramento, completing the necessary
arrangements for the concert the
clubs will give on January (>. This
is a very desirable date, as the
State Assembly is then in session,
and there are about 1500 visitors in
the city during that time. The
people of Sacramento are taking a
lively interest in the concert, and
Mr. Brown estimates the gross re
ceipts at $300. Newman, '96, Clay
ton, ex-'96, Van Voorhees, '00, and
Van Norden, '96, will also assist in
creating interest in the visit. Man
ager Brown in his latest letter to
Manager Kaufman states that he is
very well pleased with Sacramento,
which he says will be well worked
and well advertised.
In his letter Manager Brown also
states that great interest is taken
in our recent football victory, which
will be a. good advertisement for the
clubs. The people all expect foot
ball and college songs and in conse
quence the clubs have begun dili
gently to rehearse our football
songs. "We'll Rush the Ball
Along"' and "When Murphy
Kicked the Goal" will be in
their repertoire. The clubs are re
hearsing diligently every day, and
the trip, in spite of all the obsta
cles, premises to be a success. Man
ager Friedlander of San Francisco
has estimated the gross receipts of
the trip at $>>,800.
