# EXCELLENT PROSPECTS.
## The 						Representative of the Glee and Mandolin Clubs Meeting- With Good Success in the North. 
### 
Another enthusiastic letter has
heen received from Manager H. 11.
Brown, dated Chico, California, in
which he tells of the excellent suc
cess with which he is meeting in
his efforts to arrange for the con
certs of the musical organizations
in the Northern towns, lie has al
ready visited Sacramento, Marys
vi lie, and Chico, and reports every
thing fixed up in good style. In
Sacramento the entertainment has
heen well advertised, a ltd the matter
left in the hands of enthusiastic
Stanford alumni and supporters.
The members of the clubs will all
l>e entertained al the homes of
private parties, many ladies having
kindly volunteered to act as
hostesses on that occasion.
In Marysville the prospects are
also very favorable. There are a
number of ex-Stanford students
there who have taken the matter in
hand with a great deal of earnest
ness and enthusiasm, and who pro
pose to make the entertainment a,
success in every particular. Marys
ville is naturally a very good show
town, and the clubs are further
helped along by the fact that there
are no attractions for eight days be
fore and live days after their ap
pearance there.
At Chico the same fluttering
prospects exist as at Sacramento
and .Marysville. Not only have
the people taken a great interest in
the coming event, but they have
also volunteered to entertain all the
club members at their homes.
Word has also been received
from Seattle. Wash., Portland, and
Salem, Or., that arrangements are
being made for the clubs' enter
tainment in those places. Man
ager Brown 1 eit Chico for Eugene,
Or., Monday night, and will pro
ceed from there to Portland.
Prom the favorable and enthus
iastic letters received from Mr.
Brown the members of the Glee and
Mandolin Clubs are convinced that
the approaching tour is to be a
success and are much encouraged
in their efforts to get the clubs into
condition for the trip. In doing
this they have labored under a
great many disadvantages, spend
ing many otherwise busy hours in
faithful practice, and are not vet
free from the worries of final ex.'s
and the general heavy work inci
dent to the close of the term. The
time of departure has been set for
next Tuesday afternoon. The
clubs will consist of twenty-four
members including the student
body representative, and will be
gone about two weeks. In all of
the towns the most favorable terms
have been secured and the trip
should not only prove of interest to
the members themselves but of real
value to the University as well.
