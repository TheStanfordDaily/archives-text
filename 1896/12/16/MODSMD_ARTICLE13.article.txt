With this issue the present man
agement of the Daily Palo Alto
makes its bow and retires. Prob
ably no editor of the Daily ever
laid by the shears and paste-pot
without a feeling of relief that the
responsibilities and trials of office
were over, yet it is equally probable
that no one ever left the elusive
pursuit of University news without
a feeling of genuine regret. Jour
nalism is always fascinating, even
though it be amateur journalism,
and sandwiched in between huge
slices of University work.
In retiring, the present manage
ment begs leave to make a few sug
gestions tending toward the good of
the paper. The first is a warning
against permitting the Daily to
pass into the hands of any one
element in the student body. How
ever unfortunate it may be, it is
nevertheless a fact that there is in
Stanford, as elsewhere, a certain
amount of fraternity-nonfraternity
antagonism. For many reasons it
would be an unfortunate thing
should the paper pass entirely into
the hands of one or the other of
these factions. We do not claim
that any such faction would neces
sarily use its power in a manner
prejudicial to the other, but we do
claim that there would be bound
less opportunity for such action.
The inference is plain. The Palo
Alto, through no fault, we believe,
of the ruling element, has passed
in the last year into the hands of
one of these factions. There seems
to be no reason for this condition,
other than that fraternity men do
not come forward and try for places
on the staff; but the melancholy
fact remains that only one member
of this semester's staff is a member
of a fraternity.
The second admonition is a
"kick." No college journal in the
United States is so poorly housed
as is this one. There seems to be
no way of preventing this at pres
ent, but future managements and
the University authorities would do
well to keep this matter in mind.
No one, a woman in particular,
should be asked to attempt to do
journalistic work under such cir
cumstances as exist at present in

connection with this paper. We
would, therefore, humbly suggest
that on that far-distant day, when
our new biddings are erected, the
authorities remember the now in
dispensable University daily, and
provide suitable quarters.
