The question of compulsory
j chapel service is being much dis
cussed of late in various educa
tional institutions in the East. The
qestion is not one, it may be said,
that concerns only the universities
in that part of the country. It is,
on the contrary, one of deep inter
est to the majority of college stu
dents, and as such, concerns all.
We in California do not believe in
compulsory chapel attendance, and
especially here at Stanford where
the question of sectarianism is one
almost unknown. But we do be
lieve in chapel services, and the
question with us is not shall our
students be forced to go, but how
shall matters be arranged that tin
largest possible attendance may be
secured. In some universities in
; the East especially good music is
j provided each morning, and a
large choir is obtained by allowing
[ two hours' credit to those who sing;
in other places this service is held
but three times a week and that in
j the evening at (> o'clock. The lat
ter would seem to be a very wise
plan, as most students would rather
go to a vesper service than get up
twenty minutes earlier of a morn
ing in order to attend one at <S
o'clock. Other colleges have tried
and are still trying new experi
ments, and many with much the
same result as our present system
has produced â€”;i half-hour's service
each morning with about twelve
people in attendance. We need to
think upon this subject. If our
daily chapel services are to be gen
erally helpful and instructive in
stead of flat failures they must lie
so arranged as to meet the demands
of the greatest number interested,
and the best way to do this is by
experimenting until we at last hit
upon the most satisfactory and suc
cessful method of bringing them
into popular favor.
