# The 						Senior's Feelings.
## 
### 
It is a melancholy tiling for the
majority of men to feel themselves
fairly entered upon the last college
year. To he sure.we all know that
in the matter of dignity we are
much compensated for the passing
of time. It is no small thing to
cut names in an exclusive table.
You who are seniors, gentlemen,
have your blessings.
And yet in a surprisingly short
time the leaves will he red, then
blow about your feet, and you will
hunt your great-coat. Winter is
here in a twinkling, and then can
any one of you who watch the time,
say that some day shall not find
him gloomy. It is not very hard
t<> see vividly before you the clay
when you shall go vacantly along
the walk with a diploma, thinking
i>f four line years and saying as a
boy after a lire, '"All over." But
come, gentlemen, it is'but fall, we
have time before us. There are no
lions in the way fora long time,
and before we finht them it is a
pleasant way. — Yale (-oorant.
