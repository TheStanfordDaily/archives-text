"The law of the church and its
influence on modern civilization''
was the subject of last night's
lecture l»y l'rof. Lathrop. He
spoke, in brief, as follows:
Everyone's religious conceptions
and belief, bis most inward thoughts,
have been influenced by Catholi
cism, which was not a collection
of dogmas, but a working force in
the world. This was exhibited in
its system of law, which is the
clearest expression of the whole
spirit of society, ll is the working
of forces in modifying actual ideas
in praciica 1 life.
The canon law exerted during
the Middle Ages an influence which
is perceptible at the present day.
In tin* Middle Ages canon law ex
tended through those regions gov
erned by Roman Catholic Christen
dom. It, penetrates deep into social
and political life; .ill relations of
human existence are taken by it
within its scope. It insists on de
ciding all questions in the courts
concerning ecclesiastical matters.
Temporal law has for its object
men united into a political commu
nity. The church aims at bringing
all the activities of man into a the
ocracy. It aims at the Cliristiani
zation of law and thereby the
Christianization of life. To Chris
tianize law in the Middle Ages was
to humanize law. The church from
the beginning had great humane
ideas; it was the guardian of the
treasures of ancient civilization.
Life of warfare existed —strife and
carousal; the best and bravest war
riors were most desirable. The
Teutons brought with them into the
life of the Middle Ages a. love of
freedom. The church worked for
education and enlightenment; thus
the canon law has come at last to
be one of the foundation stones of
modern civilization.

It forgot or despised the practical
necessities of life. Regarding mar
riage, the maid was only the occa
sion of legal transaction —marriage
was only a transfer from paternal
control to legal control by the hus
band. Social organizations of the
Middle Ages suffered from such
contracts. liut the church com
mitted the crime of heresy; it
kindled hundreds of funeral pyres;
and heresy is high treason against
the spiritual stale which the church
represents. Otherwise there would
never have been the war in the
Middle Ages against freedom of
thought.
