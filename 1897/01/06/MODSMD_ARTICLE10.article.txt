## 
### 
A game of football was played by
the Stanford Freshman eleven
against the Santa Cruz High
School team on New Year's day.
The game was a tie. Score: 6-6.
The Freshman management did
not receive the challenge of the
High School tin til it was too late to
prevent members of the team from
leasing during vacation, and the
team was much weakened by the
absence of Captain Murphy, Bur
nett, and Daly. The Freshmen
lined up as follows: Center, Buntin;
guards, Ballentyne and Blanchard;
tackles, Coates and Rusk; ends,
McFadden and McLaine; quarter,
Clemans; halves, Seoville and Mc-
Gilvray; fullback, Beckett; substi

tut.e, Freeman. The latter was
taken l>y agreement, a* no freshman
could he found, and played full
back after Coates was injured,
Beckett, going to tackle. McCJilvray,
Beckett, ltusk, and Ballentyne
played good games for the Fresh
men, while the hest work for Santa
Cruz was done hy the halves and
the right end, B. I). Stewart, who
enters the University this semester.
After the game the team, man
ager, and officials were given a
theater party.
