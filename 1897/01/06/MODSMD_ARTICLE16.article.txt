The establishment of a telegraph
office on the campus is something
which conies to us in the nature of
supplying a sadly-felt want. For
the past semester we have had no
telegraphic connection nearer than
I'alo Alto and the inconvenience
resulting therefrom has been con
siderable. The efforts of the electri
cal engineers in bringing the office
here will be much appreciated.
