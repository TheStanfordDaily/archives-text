It is possible that no more inter
collegiate football games mav be
played in New York City. Eastern
college men are so directing. The
objections urged are the gambling
and speculation on the result; the
grounds are always overcrowded
and the college adherents who come
from a great distance are often un
able to see the game. It is thought
that if the games are played on
college grounds these dangers may
be eliminated.
There is no doubt much to be
said on both sides of this prop
osition. And yet we are fondly
looking forward to the time when

our intercollegiate match will be
played here or on the Berkeley
grounds. From a financial stand
point at least, there would be an
immense advantage resulting from
a saving of the large amount that
is needed each year to arrange suit
able grounds in San Francisco.
