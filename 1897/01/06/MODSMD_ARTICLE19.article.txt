The students who are fortunate
enough to return this semester will
miss many familiar faces on the
quad. Those who are still here
have some room for confidence in
themselves from that fact alone. It
is becoming more and more appar
ent that the student who remains
in Stanford University must have
intellectual and moral qualifi
cations of a high order. This is
certainly as it should be, in spite of
all our sympathy for those who fall
by the wayside. Bad scholarship
indicates unfitness for the work
which it is the purpose of this Uni
versity to carry forward. The un
ambitious or inefficient student
should not be allowed to take up
the time of instructors and the
facilities of an institution which
could be extended with better re
sults to a student of better scholar
ship. Bright college men generally
make successful men, and success
ful graduates advance the fame of
an institution of learning. The
efforts of any corps of teachers
should be expended on the best
available material. But the man
who will be the greatest credit to
any institution is the m;in who
cherishes high ideals. The man
who has no high sense of honor or
high view of iife is not fit to receive
the prestige which the label of i'
university gives to him.
