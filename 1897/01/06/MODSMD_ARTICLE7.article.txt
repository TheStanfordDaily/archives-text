						Rare Book for Stanford Library.

### 
The University library has re
ceived word that a copy Â«>f the cel
ebrated "Vatican Codex'' is on its
way here by express.
This book is a copy of a cel
ebrated Aztec book of ritual held in
the Vatican library at Rome. The
copy coming here, together with
three or four others, was made by
M. le Due de Loubat and distrib
uted among four or live of the best
libraries in this country.
The reproductions are very faith
ful copies of the original, one of
the most interesting of pre-Colum
bian relics. Its leaves open and
shut like a modern fan, and are
decorated in the sombre colors of the
ancient Aztecs. There was once a
turquoise on each side. The book
is now battered and old looking,
with its number, 8778, in lettering
of the Kith century still dimly
visible.
