At the beginning of each new
semester interest in class affairs is
somewhat revived. (Has* spirit
is not strong enough here to re
mind a student very often that lie
is a member of a particular class
and interested in the high standing
maintained by that class in the
I'niversity. The coining classelec
tions should serve as a reminder,
and the different class organizations
should receive during the next few
weeks the interest to which thev

are entitled. The class organi
zations are here so completely over
shadowed by the larger student
body organization that many stu
dents lose sight of the fact that the
manner in which any class organi
zation is run should be of concern
to all the members of that class.
The fact is, the way in which the
class organizations are run is of
importance to the entire University.
Just at present most of the classes
have bills against them which they
are making no attempts at all to
pay and for which no one in parti
cular seems responsible. All four
classes will probably contract many
more debts this semester. The in
difference with which these debts
have been regarded in the past
should not be allowed to continue.
The class which leaves an unpaid
debt behind it casts discredit upon
the University. The creditors often
do not understand that it is a class
which owes them. They charge it
up to the University.
If the classes themselves go on in
the reckless course they have pur
sued heretofore, those in authority
will doubiless find it necessary to
take some measures to compel them
to square their accounts before leav
ing the University. Meanwhile the
individual members of the different
classes will do well to see that class
officials are held accountable for
more business-like methods. Par
simony is class affairs is not neces
sary or desirable. Hut class busi
ness should be run on a business
basis.
