# UNIVERSITY AND ALUMNI.
## What the Latter Owe to the Former.

Jn a recent address before the
students of Indiana University
Prof. Frank A. Fetter struck a key
note that will find its echo among
the loyal students of every modern
university, lie said in part:
There is no greater kindness that
can he done to a young man or
woman, casting ahout upon a col
lege to attend, yet unacquainted
with the educational advantages of
fered by the various schools, than
that of directing him to an institu
tion where high-class opportunities
are offered at a low cost. lam
sure I feel undiniinishing gratitude
to those who many years ago
guided me to Indiana. University.
The wonderful development that
higher education has taken on in
the past generation, the great in
crease in the number and propor
tion of college students in almost
every community, has made it im
possible even for parents and older
friends who have had college train
ing to judge easily between the
claims of different schools. And
the decision is still more difficult
when, ;is often happens, no member
of the family has any acquaintance
with colleges to aid in making a
choice in this matter. To save
young people in such a situation
from making the mistake of select
ing inefficient and mercenary
schools is a service to them, to their
families, and to society.
Nothing is so high a recommen
dation fora college in the judgment
of the community as for its old stu
dents to retain their affection for
and loyalty to it. Nothing is per
haps more difficult for an old stu
dent, engrossed in his business
cares, than to keep up his acquaint
ance with his alma water, if the
active students do not serve as the
mediums and messengers between
the living school and her distant
children. Young and old, men in
different callings and of interests in
many respects divergent, can be
bound together by the one bond of
regard for their common alma ma
ter.
To be a part of an institution
which is dragging out an unpro
gressive life, at the very time when
t ho greatest universities are advanc
ing by leaps and bounds, is unin
spiring and deadening. And, more
than that, the very efforts which
we put forth to promote our alma
mater are the most effective means
possible of developing in us a
deeper and an enduring apprecia
tion of the opportunities which we
here enjoy.
One who has watched closely and
with penetrating vision the educa
tional movements of the past dec
ade said to me recently: "The next
few years are going to witness a re
markable struggle among the col
leges. The outcome will decide
which of them are to sink to the
grade of small colleges and which
are to develop into great universi
ties." We who have such faith in
the future of our university may
deem it no small privilege to be a
part, of her life in this epoch when
history is making, and to feel that
we also are contributing in some
degree to a result beneficient for the
future of education, not only in the
state but in the nation.
