It is the object of this article to
meet ;i call for information regard
ing the management of the Co-op
erative Store. During the past year
the present hoard has heen working
toward an improvement, hut it re
quires more than a superficial ex
amination to make changes which
will not leave toe business in a
worse or, ;it least, in no better con
dition than at present.
The root of t he evil lies in the
facttl::ii the management is gov
erned iÂ»y college politics. A eon
trolling number of directors have
been elected each year, who are not
only quite ignorant of the business

but have 1 iitie direct interest in it;
and they have elected a manageri
with no particular business train-1
ing, to whom they have indirectly
pledged their vote, so that the per
manent members have not had the
controlling voice. Consequently,
indirectly through political machi
nations, the manager has been al
lowed to-elect himself. No mana
ger has even left any scale of prices
from which his successor may work,
and hence the new manager has al
ways been handicapped to that ex-!
tent in his purchases. The mana
gers have received a compensation
out of proportion to the services
rendered.
The Co-op. has not been doing
all the hook-buying business of the
University. This is partly due, no
doubt, to antagonistic sentiment, 1
but also to the fact that but a frac
tion of the student body are inter
ested as members of the associa
tion. Every student should he en
titled to discounts. The scheme of
charging two prices, which so com
plicates the business that it is next
to impossible for an auditing com
mittee to look into and keep record
of the business, should be dune
away with.
By means of the temporary na
ture of the management it is im
possible to obtain the same terms
from the publishers as are obtained
bv the Coast agents. In fact,
books are purchased through these
agents by the store cheaper than
can be done from the publishing
house direct. 1 see no reason why
the store should not expect rates al
most as good as these agents. But
it certainly will not receive such
until it has a standing of perma
nency among the publishing
houses.
Further, there is a large accu
mulation of stock, and as these
books exist as property paid for,
it has necessitated a higher selling
price. This accumulation could be
kept down by an experienced man
ager and a heartier co-operation on
the part of the professors. To gain
the advantage of transportation
rates the estimate orders of profes
sors should be turned in by them,
or better, personally solicited by
the manager early enough to allow
a shipment by freight.
The board of directors is working
to eliminate these defects, and es
pecially wishes the co-operation of
those who have shown an active de
sire to have a co-operative store
which will be of more benefit to the
student body. To remedy the first
enumerated evil it is suggested that
we reincorporate under the new
laws of California and that the
management be put in the hands of
a faculty committee or a committee
of their appointment. That profes
sors have a live interest in the wel
fare of the students is shown by the
fact that some have themselves or
dered books for the students in or
der to secure better discounts.
Fuller information regarding the
scheme of reincorporation will be
laid before the members later. At
present the Co-op. is on a good fi
nancial basis, and an invitation to
examine the books, looking toward
improvement, is extended to any
member of the faculty.

Acting President.
