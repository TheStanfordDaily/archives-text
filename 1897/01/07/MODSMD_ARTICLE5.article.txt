Mr. (J. A. Clark, Dr. Jordan's pri

the Bering Sea Seal Commission,
returned on December ;>O.
Dr. Jordan, as head of the com
mission sent by the governments
of the United States and Great
Britain to investigate the condition
of the fur-bearing seals in Alaska
and the Bering Sea, made his re
port to the Treasury and State
Departments of the United States
Government. This report was or
dered printed but has not yet been
made public. The presence of Dr.
Jordan will be necessary in Wash
ington in February in connection
with the final report of the Com
mission, on which Secretary Clark
is now at work.
President Jordan stated that
negotiations have been already be
gun between t lie English and
American governments, having for
their object the protection of the
seals. The Russian government is
also very much interested in the
settlement of the difficulty.
Dr. Jordan said: "There is in
my mind no doubt that, if the
policy of the present administration
is continued, the result of the pres
ent negotiations will be an
amicable solution of the difficulty,
according complete and satisfactory
protection to the seals. The only
danger lies in a change of policy
bv the ensuing administration."
Dr. Jordan stated that there would
be no necessity of sending another
commission to Alaska, the work of
the present commission having been
very comprehensive, but that one
member would revisit Alaska next
summer in order to ascertain the
changes if any in the condition of
the seals.
From bis notes and observations
of the habits and manner of life of
the seal, obtained while in the
North, Dr. Jordan has prepared
two lectures, which will be illus
trated by views taken during the
trip. A lecture on "The Fur Seal"
will be given by Dr. Jordan Satur
day evening in Nortree Hall, Palo
Alto, for the benefit of the Improve
ment Fund.
