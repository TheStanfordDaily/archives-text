# Summer Trip to the Mediterranean.
## 
### 
An opportunity to spend a pleas
ant and profitable summer vacation
is offered by Professor H. 11.
Powers to anyone who wishes to
join the party which will leave here
at the close of the semester fora
European trip. Having accom
panied many similar parties, Pro
fessor Powers has planned a trip
with many attractions which the
usual itinerary of tourists does not
include. The party will consist
principally of students or those
who have the student spirit, and it
is the purpose of the party to make
a serious and profitable study of
the civilization, customs, and art of
the countries visited without mak
ing the trip laborious or fatiguing.
They will visit that part of Europe
where traveling is the most ex
pensive, and gain some knowledge
of the language and customs of the
countries, at a price far below that
at which any individual could take
the trip in the same profitable
manner.
This trip offers special induce
ments with relation to Greece,
which of all countries is most in
teresting to the student of history
or art. All places ordinarily visited
are included in this trip. Arrange
ments have been made to secure one
of the best American archaeologists
to accompany the party during its
sojourn in Greece. Spain, until
recently somewhat inaccessible,
will be visited; also France, Ger
many, and Jtaly, with excursions
to all of the most interesting cities,
are numbered in the attractions of
this trip. The price of the whole
trip is $(577, or, excluding Spain,
$587. Those who do not wish to
visit Spain or who wish to start
later than May 29 can t?ail by the
same line June 12. The party will
leave London for New York
August 25.
