# TRACK SEASON FORECASTS
## Men Who Will Train for the Intercollegiate Events. 
### 
Already a large number of men
have signified their intention of en
tering for the track team. Every
effort will lie made to bring out all
the material that may be available
or latent. While the outlook is not
discouraging, yet a victory can be
gained this year only by hard and
conscientious work. Berkeley will
put a strong team in the Held, hav
ing lately made some valuable ad
ditions to the team. What we need
most are bicyclists, a mile walker,
a shot-putter, and a hammer
thrower. Candidates for some of
the other events, however, are not
abundant.
Below is given a partial sum
mary of the candidates who expect
to begin training as soon as the
track and Held are in good condi
tion for work. Some of the new
men come to us with good records,
but these will have to be verified on
our own own track before we shall
be justified in making any estimate
of our strength.
