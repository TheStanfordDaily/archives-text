We shall have the opportunity
next Sunday of hearing one of the
ablest divines on the Coast. Dr.
Horatio Stebbins needs no recom
mendation here where he is already
well known. He delivered the
baccalaureate sermon to the gradu
ating class last spring, and has
preached here on other occasions.
He is recognized as a man of broad
culture, of great intellectual vigor,
and of imposing personal influence.
No one will be disappointed in
hearing Dr. Stebbins.
