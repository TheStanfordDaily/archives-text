The unusually pleasant attrac
tions of our balmy atmosphere
these winter days often make us
pity our college brethren of the

snow-bound East. But those we
pity doubtless find an advantage
in the very thing which makes us
pity them. The Easterner who
comes to this region can not but
notice that the climate has greatly
influenced the people of this valley;
that its influence has even laid its
hold upon the student who has but
lately come here. There is an in
vigorating influence exerted by an
Eastern winter which the student
here does not experience as he
lounges in the sun at all seasons.
The student who resists the temp
tation to spend his time in the idle
enjoyment of his genial surround
ings here deserves more credit than
the one who works because he is
cooped up and could do nothing
else if he would.
