# CUTS AT YALE.
## Absence from Work is Made to Count. 
### 
A new system of cuts and marks
has been introduced at Vale which
is designed to reduce the number of
absences from daily recitation and
make regularity of_ attendance im
perative.
According to the older system
six cuts were allowed the student
with the idea that they should be
taken for illness and other minor
causes for absence. '{However, by
degrees, excuses for, sickness came
to lÂ»e granted considerable
leniency, and the six regular cuts
were taken generally for the con
venience or pleasure of the student.
This result was of course strictly at
variance with the object of the rule,
and this year the plan has been
tried oj a 1 lowing no cuts at all with
out a positive excuse.
These defects have been guarded
against in the new regulations un
der which no man is entirely ex
cused for any absence of less than
a week, it beiugconsidered thatanv
illness of shorter duration is not of
sufficient consequence to warrant
his absence from the class-room.
Inasmuch as absence from work is
a distinct loss to the student, and
those whose attendance is regular
deserve to he credited with a higher
mark, the penalty of a deduction of
one point from tiie standing of the
subject in question is made upon
such absence. Any student who is
excusably absent fora week or
more can maintain liis standing by
making up his lost work in the us
ual manner.
Up to this point the system has
been found to work with great suc
cess. and its general effects will
certainly be in the direction of pro
ducing more regular attendance of
the students who most need to give
attention to their work, and of pre
venting the superficial granting of
sick excuses for minor causes.
