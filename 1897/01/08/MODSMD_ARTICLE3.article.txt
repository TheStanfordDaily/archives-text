A moderate-sized audience lis-

tened to the address on "Fabian
Socialism" this afternoon by Rev.
\V. D. P. Bliss. While he held that
progress was not possible without a
struggle for existence, he maintained
that with the doing away with the
motive of mere physical existence,
higher motives would he brought
into effect. Co-operation would ap
peal to the workingmaivs honor
and moral character, rather than
! the baser motives of acquiring a
fortune or physical comfort. It
would offer the millionaire as great
opportunities for development as
the present system does, for his pri
mary motive in amassing wealth is
i not the possession of dollars but
the power it gives him. In the
new system the field for personal
endeavor would be no less limited
than under Ihe pi esent.
Municipalism of industry is ihe
I true method of reform. That must
precede nationalization. Telegraphs
land railroads should be directly
(under governmental control, and
! will be, in the opinion of the lec
iturer, within a few years. We
j must follow the example of Kuro-
I pean cities in this movement, and
! there is no logical reason why we
| should not.
