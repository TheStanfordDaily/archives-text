# MUSICAL CLUBS RETURN
## Northern Trip a Distinct Success and Every Bill Is Paid. 
### 
After a tour of over two thousand
miles through California, Wash
ington, and Oregon, the Stanford
(ilee and Mandolin Clubs arrived
in Palo Alto last night at live
o'clock and returned ut once to the
University. The men were given a
pleasant reception everywhere they
went and in many places were roy
ally entertained. The trip was
most enjoyable to all who made it,
and created :i good impression in
all the towns visited. Riley and
Dillon made great hits everywhere.
The clubs left the University on
the last Tuesday of last semester
and proceeded at once to Tacoma.
Twelve concerts were given in the
following places i 11 the order named:
Tacoma, Seattle, and Olympia,
Washington; Vancouver, B. C.; As
toria, Portland, Oregon City, Sa
lem, and Eugene, Oregon; and
Chico, Marysville, and Sacramento,
California.
The trip can not be considered a
failure. The advertising it gave
the University is inestimable. Hut
the distance between the towns in
which concerts could be given was
so great that the trip could not be
made to pay expenses. Twenty
live men had to travel 2,185 miles
in all and many incidental ex
penses could not be avoided. All
the money necessary to pay the ex
penses of the trip was advanced by
the student body and no bill* have
been left anywhere unpaid. The
amount received from the trip is
•$")()5 less than the amount paid out.
The members of the Clubs gave
their individual notes to the Asso
ciated Students for $550 before
starting on the trip. The clubs are
given until the 15th of April to
make np the deficit before being
called upon for the payment of the
notes. There is little doubt that
the deficit will be reduced to only
a nominal amount bv that time
and perhaps extinguished entirely.
The clubs will give a return con
cert in the chapel next Friday
night under student body manage
ment. They are in better condition
than ever before and no doubt a
large audience of students and pro
fessors will greet them on their re
turn appearance. The clubs will
give the same pieces they rendered
on their tour, both Riley and Dillon
being on the program.
The work of advance agent was
done b}' H. H. Brown, '96. Treas
urer Morrison in speaking
this afternoon of the arrange
ments made by the advance agent
said: "Brown did line work as ad
vance agent. A better selection
could not have been made. The
advertising matter was well placed
and all the advance agent's work
was very carefully and conscien
tiously done."
