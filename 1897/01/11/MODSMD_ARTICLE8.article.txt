The proposition made by the
Velodrome people in San Francisco
to establish professional football is
a rude shock to athletic decency.
This plan to intrude upon amateur
ism and drag the last and dearest
college sport into the professional
category is one that should be ac
tively combated by every university
in the country and every true lover
of amateur sport. To degrade foot
ball to the professional rank means
its sure death after being disgraced
by a trained set of gladiatorial
bruisers. Every man on the Coast
who knows tne noble game of foot
ball should do all he can in its de
fense.
