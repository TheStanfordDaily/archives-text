Visitors to the University are
greatly impressed with the beauties
of the arboretum and surrounding
grounds and are unreserved in ex
pressing admiration, but they are
invariably surprised upon seeing
tlie grassy paths and driveways
showing all too plainly that this
beautiful park is almost totally un
used by students. The arboretum
is an ideal place to spend an hour
rambling about or in study. That
students appreciate facilities for
open-air study and many even pre
fer to work outside is shown by the
extensive use that is made of the
quad for that purpose. At all
hours on a pleasant day every
available seat on the quad is oc
cupied, and often the class rooms
are depleted of their regular quota
of chairs to accommodate those who
wish to spend their time in the
shade and sunshine of the quad
rangle.
Taking these facts into consid
eration, it would seem that there is
a demand for some accommodation
to allow of outdoor work, and the
first place to invite our attention is
the arboretum. With but slight
expense these lovely grounds
could be made a park where stu
dents would be attracted to spend
a great deal of their time in study
and recreation, which they now
spend in idleness or bending list
lessly over a table in a close room.

The building of rustic seats, bowers,
and other rests would answer the
purpose well, and would be appre
ciated by the men and women of
the University.
