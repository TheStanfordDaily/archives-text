### 
The Executive Committee of the
student hody met last evening in
its regular monthly meeting.
Treasurer F. \V. Morrison made
a verbal report showing the condi
tion of the student hody treasury at
present. He stated that the trip of
the musical cluhs would tie up un
til April IS or thereabouts $500 of
the student body's money. He es
timated the assets at $1800, includ
ing in that estimate the notes of
the members of the musical clubs.
Treasurer Morrison said that in his
opinion, if the committee exercised
the same prudence and foresight as
it had in the past, the present ad
ministration would leave the stu
dent body with only about $">OO in
debtedness remaining.
The assets of the student body
are approximate!)'as follows: Cash,
$400; football souvenir, $875; mu
sical clubs' notes, $550. The com
plete reports of Treasurer Morrison
will appear in the Daily Palo
Alto.
Track Manager Dave Brown, '97,
was present and heard the report of
Treasurer Morrison. Manager
Brown said that he did not wish to
urge the connnitteee to any action
detrimental to the interests of the
student body, but that in order to
equal and improve upon our track
record of last year a coach was nec
essary for the team. "A coach for
the team,'' he said, "could be ob
tained if the committee appropri
ated $150. In addition to this the
track men would have to raise $75
or $100 in order to have the coach
fora sufficient length of time."
Manager Hrown estimated the other
expenses of the track season at
$100, and the receipts at $200,
which would make a. net outlay on
the part of the student body of $50
for the season.
The committee made the appro
priation of $150 for the track coach,
and granted Manager Brown the
privilege of circulating a subscrip
tion for the remaining sum neces
sary.
A motion was carried, at the
suggestion of Treasurer .Morrison
and Manager Brown, providing
that in the future managers of
teams, student body officials, and
others, collecting money by sub
scription to be used for student
body purposes or in connection
with any of the teams, be required
to deposit the money raised with
the student body treasurer; the
money to be expended by the
treasurer as the managers desig
nate. This motion was passed in
order that all money raised by sub
scription and expended for student
body purposes might appear on the
books of the treasurer, and it does
not hamper in any way the action
of the managers.
A committee was appointed to
audit the accounts of the treasurer
for last semester, consisting of
