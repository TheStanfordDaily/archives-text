# TRACK COACH SECURED.
## J.F. King of Multnomah Athletic Club Will Train our Athletes. 
### 
Prior to the meeting of the Ex
ecutive Committee last evening, in
which $150 was appropriated fora
track coach, Manager Brown had
been negotiating with J. F. King of
Portland, Or., who is the trainer of
the Multnomah Athletic Club, with
a view of securing his services for
the Stanford track team. Now
that the track management is as
suredof $150, which will be devoted
to that purpose, there is no longer
any obstacle in the way of secur
ing the services of Mr. King.
.1. F. King is an athlete himself
and is well known in athletic cir
cles. He is now a man about thir
ty-live years old and has been con
nected with athletics in some form
since his boyhood. He entered the
ranks of professional sprinters and
established a record of 9 4-5 sec. in
the 100-yd. dash, and made that
event in 10 flat in numerous compe
titions.
Mr. King has a record of 6 ft.
8 in.in the high jump. He is a
professional bicycle rider and an
able all-round athlete. Asa com
petitor in the old Caledonian event,
the hop, step, and jump, he es
tablished the world's record.
Mr. King won the sweepstakes
in the hundred yard event in the
world meet of crack sprinters at
Omaha, and also in Australia.
After the Omaha meet he was en
gaged as trainer of the Omaha
Athletic Club's track team, and de
veloped a ten seconed man named
Tremble. The Omaha team that
year won the championship at the
field-day of the Western Athletic
Associat ion.
Trainer King then secured a
position at the Olympic Club
of San Francisco. Six years ago
he became the trainer of the ath
letes of the Multnomah Athletic
Club of Portland, Oregon, and he
now holds the position of physical
director in that club. Since Mr.
King has been connected with the
Multnomah Club the club's ath
letic team has held from year to
year the championship of the Pa
cific Northwest. During that time
a number of the best athletes on
the Coast have been developed in
the club, mainly through the ability
of Mr. King as a trainer and a
coach.
Charles Frazier, ex-'9B, was one
of his pupils in the bicycle events.
Herbert Kerrigan of the Mult
nomah Club holds t he Coast record,
jointly with Patterson, of 0 ft. 2 in.
in the high jump.
\V. E. Tallent holds the Coast
record of 4:80 in the mile and has
a record of 2:04 in the half. Mor
gan, '00, and Burnett, '00, were de
veloped by Trainer King. The Mult
nomah Club easily showed its su
periority on the track last year,
when the Olympic Club was easily
defeated.
Coach King will arrive about
February 1, and will immediately
take charge of the team. Those
who know him state that he has
the qualities of inspiring interest
and enthusiasm in the men, and
seem confident of his ability to
turn out a winning team for Stan
ford.
Manager Brown received the fol

lowing telegram from Mr. King this
afternoon: ''I will come Feb. 1."
