### 
ltev. Dr. Stebbins of the First
Unitarian Church of San Francisco
delivered the University sermon
Sunday morning in the chapel,
lie spoke from the first chapter of
Genesis, taking us his text the
words, "In the beginning God
created the heaven and the earth.
And the earth was without form
and void; and darkness was upon
the face of the deep. And the
spirit of God moved upon the face
of the waters.''
One supreme idea possessed the
author of this; lie discerned that
the Creator was moved by intel
ligence, that the scenes of the crea
tion were directed by an intelligent
guiding spirit. He affirms a cause,
and cause affirms will. The de
velopment of this very thought has
been ihe final theme of all philos
ophy and all science. It, is a sub
lime iheme that attracts the heart
of man, the thought of a personal
God, who is behind all and in all
and through all. The power that
causes the seasons also worketh in
us to will and to do His good pleas
ure. Here we have the natural
and the supernatural. According
to our mood the theme is a dark
one or it is full of hopeand beauty,
one of angelic vision.
What is nature? We all know or
say we know, but when we are
asked we can not tell. It is with ns
as with Saint Augustine, who said:
"If you do not ask me what time is,
I know; but if you ask me, J do not
know." The seasons, the changing
bud and blossom, the laws of forces,
all suggest to us what nature is.
They suggest to us reason, and per
fection, and order.
There is a distinction between
the kingdom of mind and of na
ture. The will is not of tlie same
rank with machinery, nor is the
law of the mind on the same level
with the law of gravitation or the
growing of corn. There is in man
si supernaturalism, the superior
world of hidden powers that drives
the heart of man as some outer
planet attracts hidden forces in
other spheres. The mind of the
child is an epitome of the mind of
the race. This supernaturalism of
human nature expresses itself in all
the works of early man when all
forces and all objects in the out
side world were named as gods.
Witchcraft and sorcery were uni
versally looked upon as manifesta
tions of an evil being.
The change lias come so that in
stead of one evil and one good Hod
we have but one and He is good.
The religion of the early age is il
lumined now by the rising day of
truth. Justice, hope, reason, and
faith make this the genial climate
of the mind, and beaming over it
is God's infinite goodness.
We can not separate ourselves
from (iod save by a degraded pur
pose and perverted will. The tree
that you have planted and watered
laughs in thesun and frolics with the
wind; birds sing in its branches.
How much of it is the result of
your care and how much of the
earth's and sun's and God's care?
So man and God are united. This
is the supreme supernaturalism.
