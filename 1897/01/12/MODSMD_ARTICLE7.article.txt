11rk notice relating to the Carnot
debate deserves the attention and
careful consideration of all those
who are qualified to t i'v for the pre
liminaries. Unless more decide to
enter the contest for the Carnot de
bating team, Stanford's chances for
winning the medal will be seriously
injured. In order to turn out a
winning team, and in order that a
representative team may be chosen,
a vigorous competition is necessary
during the preliminary debates.
All those who are yet undecided
must make up their minds quickly,
as the committee has named a day
before which all candidates must
manifest their intentions.
