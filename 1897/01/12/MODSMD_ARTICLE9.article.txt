## New Field for Football Enthusiasm. 
### 
Jn a recent numher of the (Jut
look the "Spectator" brings to light
a new football phenomenon. We
copy his words without change:
There is one phase of the foot
hull controversy, which regularly
rages at about this time of the year,
that the Spectator thinks is over
looked both by the anti- and the
pro-footballists. Whatever may be
the difference of opinion about the
savagery and brutality of football,
whatever may be thought of the
value of breaking noses and goug
ing out eyes as a means of "devel
oping manly courage and perti
nacity in overcoming obstacles, 1 '
»here can he no two opinions about
the influence of the game upon the
literary tastes of college undergrad
uates. We all know that some of
the greatest contributions to liter
ature have been made in praise of
the glories of war and in honor of
the heroes of personal combat. If
it were not for bloodshed and
broken heads we should never have
had the Iliad of Homer, the
Chronicles of Froissart, Richard 111,
Henry V, and King John of Shaks
pere, the story of Ivanhoe, and the
lyrics and poems of our own Civil
War. Js it not probable, therefore,
the student of football phenomena
will ask. that all the noble excite
ment and passion of football, the
stirring array of maimed and band
aged players, the ambulances, the
faithful surgeons, the affrighted
umpires, the cheers of the victors,
the despair of the vanquished, the
devotion t.> alma mater, may stir
undergraduates of our colleges to a
burst of noble literary expression
that shall offset the coarser and
more brutal tendencies of the game?
To such an inquirer the Spectator
answers that not only it may but it
has. In proof of this assertion he
has only to refer to two instances.
A San Francisco paper recently
contained an account of a football
rally held by the students of Stan
ford University in one of the public
halls of that institution. Some of
the faculty were present, and amid
much enthusiasm the following
battle-cry or pee an was adopted
and rehearsed for choral use in
cheering on the combatants in the
annual football battle with the
University of California:
Give 'em the axe! the axe! the axe!
Give 'em the axe! the axe! the axe!
Give 'em the axe! Give 'em the axe!
Give 'em the axe! — Where?
Right in the neck! the neck! the neck !
llight in the neck! the neck! the neck!
Right in the neck! Right in the neck!
Right in the neck! —There!
Now this, whatever other merits
it may possess, is at least rhythmic
in form, which is more than can be
said of some of the poetry which is
offered to the Outlook for publica
tion.
The other instance is from an ac
count of a football banquet given
recently to the varsity team by the
alutnni of Princeton. The writer
then concludes:
The Spectator asks with pa
triotic confidence, Are undergradu
ate students at Oxford or Cain
bridge, or the Sorbonne, or Bologna,
capable of writing such poetry? Me
thinks not. Let those of us who are
downcast by evidences of cheating,
dishonorable practice, brutality,
and vulgarity in football as it is
played today in the schools and
colleges of this country, pluck up
courage. These vicious characteris
tics are probably manifested by
only a few of the actual players of
the game. If in the great body of

undergraduates and graduate spec
tators we can discern the first ex
pressions of a noble and inspiring
literary impulse, we ma}' hope for
a revival of learning that shall
cover with confusion those foreign
ers who sometimes sneer at Ameri
can taste and American manners.
