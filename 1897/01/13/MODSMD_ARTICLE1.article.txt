# LAST NIGHT'S LECTURE
## President Jordan Talks of the Sea Bear and Its Habits. 
### 
President Jordan delivered the
regular Tuesday evening lecture
last nignt in the chapel on "The
Fur Seal." The lecture was illus
trated with lantern slides and em
bodied some of the investigations
made )>}' Dr. Jordan while in
Alaska as a member of the U. S.
Fur Seal Commission.
The lecture was first concerned
with the early history of Alaska
and with the; expedition sent out
by the Russian (Jovernment in
ISoO t<> discover whether Siberia
was contiguous to America. This
expedition was under command of
Bering, and besides discovering the
strait which bears his na me sighted
.Nit. St. Elias. Afterwards Bering
died and Stellar, the naturalist, took
charge of the party.
They discovered four great beasts:
the sea cow, sea otter, sea lion, and
fur seal. The sea cow was an
animal that stayed on shore and
fed upon kelp. These animals have
been extinct fifty years. The sea
• •Iter is an animal with long glossy
gray fur, which is used for trim
ming sealskin cloaks. The great
sea lion is an animal as large as a
cow. with an immense head. It
has a heavy bass voice, and as
President Jordan added, "no sound
in all nature can compare with its
melody, harmony, and richness."
The fur seal, commonly so called,
is not a seal, but a water hear with
Hipper feet.
The fur seals all live together on
the hare rocks or rookeries. The
habits of (he seals were described in
detail. The discovery that Dr.
Jordan made is that the waiting
seal, the one who has no fixed
abode, is the check to an undue in
crease of the herd by trampling on
the young. This fact had not been
suspected by anyone before Presi
dent Jordan, and this result was
arrived at only after a very careful
examination of the slaughtered
young sta Is.
.Most of the killing in Bering
sea at present is of female seals and
their number has been rapidly re
duced from over two million to
four hundred thousand. The ob
jection to killing the females is that
not only are the mothers destroyed
but their young being left on the
rookeries without food starve to
death
The young males are kept off the
rookeries by the old ones and spend
their time on land, the prey of hun
ters. A certain number of them,
about thirty thousand, can be
killed every jear, and as their
skins are worth twenty dollars
each it is a lucrative business.
At one time Alaska was a profit
able source of income for the United
States, but in 1S'.)(» it cost the (iov
eriunent $185,000 to guard the
islands alone.
After the lectlire proper a num
ber of lantern slides were exhibited,
including pictures of the rookeries,
sea lions, walruses, fur seals, and a
picture of the Commission, of which
I)r. Jordan was a member.
