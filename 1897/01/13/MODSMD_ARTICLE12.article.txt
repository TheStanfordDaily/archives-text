There is a pretty general mis
conception regarding the standing
of Stanford and Berkeley in debate.
It is true that since the offering of
the cup Berkeley has won two out
of three debates. But in 1893 the
first debate between the two univer
sities was won by Stanford. Of the
four debates that have thus far
taken place Stanford has won two
and Berkeley two. That makes the
debate for the present year unu
sually interesting to both univer
sities and to outsiders.
