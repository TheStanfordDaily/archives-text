In the class elections which are
about to take place the same difti
culty will probably be met which
has always been experienced in
former elections. There will be no
trouble in finding some one to ac
cept the presidency, but the minor
offices will go begging. It is doubt
less true that there is more drudg
ery than honor in the minor offices,
but some one must fill them, and it
is a sad commentary on class loy
alty when no one present at a meet
ing will take a minor office and the
absent members have to be nomi
nated to get any candidates at all.
