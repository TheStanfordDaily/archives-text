# RETURN CONCERT
## MADE A FINE SHOWING. Resume of the Christmas Trip of the Glee and Mandolin Clubs in the North. CHAPEL, 7:30 FRIDAY EVENING JANUARY 15, 1897 
### 
The members of the (Jlee and
.Mandolin (Hubs, subdued and some
what bedraggled in appearance, hut
nevertheless happy, returned to the
I Diversity last Tliursday afternoon,
direct from their two weeks' tour of
the principal cities of the North,
where the Christmas holidays had
brought them an unusual abun
dance of honors, feastings, and good
times. From expressions heard,
they were nearly all glad to he at
home again, for the journey of six
teen days, with only one-night
stands, proved a very tiresome one,
and the members were all sadly in
need of that precious article, sleep.

However, no trip would tinve been ■
;i complete success without that,!

that might have been theirs, I»v the
elegant greeting accorded them in
the North. Concerning their warm !
reeption hv the people of Oregon,!
Washington, an<l Northern Cal
ifornia, the members are very en
thusiastic and appreciative. In
every town in which they visited
they were treated with a kindness
and a consideration that was
marked, showing that Stanford

other towns thev were given the
freedom of the eluhs and shown
many other courtesies throughout
the city. At Astoria, where the
concert was given under the aus
pices of the 10Iks. and at Kugene,
where the I'niversity of Oregon is
located, the eluhs were met at the
station hv hrass hands and est orted
to their hotel. Society turned out in
force at every concert, and with the
exception of three towns, the even
ing's entertainment wound up with
a delightful dance.
The musical part of the trip con
sisted of thirteen concerts, given in
as many places. From a financial
point of view, the trip of course
was not a genuine success, hut from
every other standpoint, it most eer

tainly was. With very few excep
tions. the clubs were greeted by
large and enthusiastic houses. The
laughable and ludicrous side of the
trip, too, was not overlooked, and
many ridiculous things happened,
which provided continuous amuse
ment for the whole company.

Speaking of Mr. Dillon the Daily Astor
iuti of Dec. 30, iBq6, says: " Whenever he
was 011 tlie boards the audience was kept in a
roar of laughter."

The tour was made with twenty
live men, including Treasurer F. \V.
Morrison and Advance Agent 11. 11.
Ibown. The start was made from
the University on the afternoon of
the 22d. of December. Two days of
interesting travel brought the clubs
to Tacoina, where the first concert
was given. Here the whole trip
threatened to he smothered just in

the hloom of its infancy, for the
seantv audience which greeted the
cluhson their appearance reminded
the unfortunate ones of a former
venture at Fresno. However the
hovs managed to get over it.and
played the next night, Christmas
night, to a large and appreciative
house in Seattle. After ihe concert
a very pleasant dance was enjoyed
by all at the home of Miss Helen
McNaught. The evening of the
2tfth saw the cluhs at Olympia,
where they were warmly received
and tendered an enjovahle dance.
The return to Portland was made
the next day, and after a day of
interest in that city the fourth
concert was given the following
evening at Vancouver. Wash., to a
well attended house. Tuesday the
cluhs spent on the Columbia river
on their way to Astoria. It was a
most enjoyable trip to all, for aside
from the novelty, it afforded the
prettiest scenery yet seen on the
tour. Astoria, was reached at •"> p.m.,
and a band and a delegation of
citizens were in waiting to escort
the hoys to their hotel. The con
cert in the evening was given under
the auspices of the local lodge of
Elks. who proved their popularity
as well as t heir ability as ''hustlers"
by providing a house packed to the
very doors. The audience was one
of the most enthusiastic met on the
trip. After the concert the clubs,
by special invitation, attended the
annual social session of the Elks.
Portland was played Wednesday
night, the .'lOtli. A large and fash

ionable audience was in attendance
at the concert and showed bv their
enthusiastic applause that the work
of the clubs had found high favor
with them. Every number was re
peatedly encored. Oregon City
was on the hills for the next night
and furnished an audience that ri
valled only that of Tacoina in ex
tensiveness. Immediately after the
concert the clubs returned to Port
land, where they attended the an
nual hop given by Company II of
that city.

ganizations were in Salem. Salem
is the home of Chester Murphy,'oo,
and it provided a generous and ap
preciative audience to do honor to
the name of Stanford. Upon the
conclusion of the entertainment the
clnhs repaired to Chester Murphy's
home, where an elegant reception
was tendered them.
Saturday the lid found the
"troupe" in Eugene, which is the
seat of the University of Oregon.
The university hoys met them at
the t rain with their hand and es
corted them to the hotel. Thev
also accorded the cluhs a reception
and a dance after the concert and
in more ways than one showed
their generous hospitality. After
the dance a banquet was tendered
all bv the courtesy of ex-Mayor
Friendly of that city. Theaudience
at Eugene was not only a large
hut a very appreciative one.
Cliico was the next stop, and all
the members have yet the most
pleasant remembrances of that
place. Normal Hall, where t lie en
tertainment was held, was, when
the concert began, simply packed
by an audience that was second to
none in its applause and apprecia
tion. After the entertainment the
clubs adjourned to a dance, which
proved to be one of the most enjoy
able on the trip.
Marvsville was played Tuesday
night, January 5. Here also a
warm reception, a large house, and
a post-concert dance were awaiting
them.
