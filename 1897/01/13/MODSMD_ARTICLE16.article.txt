PoKTiiAND, .Jan. 1, 1897.
My Ih'nr Mr. Kaufman : Pursu
ant to request of Miss Mahelle and
aided hy the inspiration created by
the presence of tlie Stanford Glee
Cluh I have prepared some lines'
which I hope you will make good
hy adjusting such music to them
as will produce desired results.
I have tried to convey or express 1
the sentiment which the average
citizen is likely to entertain that
college glee cluhs go touring fora
"lark and the display of elegance,
and how your cluh overcame that!
sentiment or prejudice, and finally j

captivated the citizen. This idea
appears in the transition from the
"dudes'" in the first stanza to the
"young men'' in the second and the
"gentlemen" in the third.
In the second stanza I have tried
to express a tribute to the memory
of (iovernor Stanford—who, bv
the way, I knew when I was a hoy
and connect it with the theme
of the song.
I couldn't find perfect rhymes in
the lis! of names in the last stanza,

lo';ist of talent far beyond his years, and Mr.
Dillon did some dialect work that would not
have been unworthy of Joe Murphy or Bobby

I>ut the measure and meter seem to
l»e right and the "jingle*' at the
ending will bring ihe matter t«» a
close satisfactorily, I hope.
Trusting we may have the pleas
ure of hearing the hoys again soon,
and with hest wishes for their suc
cess and that of the I'niversitv,
I am, Very truly yours,

I hey told us that the Stanford l>ovs
Were 1:0111 in' to the town:
I s'posed they were a lot o' dudes—
Flie news made 'Manthv frown;

We sot ourselves to keep our boys
And irls from seem' thein,
But, b'gosh, we all are trvin' now
To have them come again.
chokcs:
('ome again next year,
All singing as you come,
Greetings wait you here
And welcome to our home.
In Californy's early days
1 knew the (iov'ner well;
I nohle friend was he, and true,
As all who knew him tell:
So when those young men got to town
1 had to go and see
Them play and hear them sing and praise
His l T Diversity.
1 always thought no singing good
Without a woman's voice,
But when I heard those gentlemen
It made my heart rejoice.
They had no trouble with their staves,
And jumped clear over bars:
And marked the time on mandolins,
Mandolas, and guitars.

And Riley tilled the bills.

PRESS NOTICES.
"The city was filled with visitors
to do honor to the Stanford hovs.
1 The clults arrived at o o'clock and
immediately took possession of the
i town. The Military Hand was at
the dock and received the visitors
in proper style. They are a fine
| looking lot of young men, hoth
j from a physical and an intellectual
point of view. The Opera House
last night was crowded from the
basement to the roof and from the
front doors to the stage. Standing
room could not be procured, and
many who wanted to hear the cele
brated Stanford boys were obliged'
to turn away in disappointment.
The house was appropriately deco
rated in (dub colors, and when the j
curtain rose the storm of applause
almost lifted the roof. Every 1111111-!
her or, the program was encored
time and again. A unique and
splendid entertainment was pre-!
sented to the Astoria public. The
large audience went away more
than satisfied. It was a success t<>;
be proud of; the clubs made a rec
ord." —Ihiily Axlorui 11, Dec. .'!().
"Mut by far the most interest was
centered in Frank Hrancli Rilev!
and C. I. Dillon, two of the most!

clever entertainers who have ever

"Salem people extended a warm
reception to the Stanford (Jlce and
Mandolin Cluhs Friday evening bv
furnishing an immense audience at
the Heed. The performance of the

audience was evident from the re

lively little selection entitled "W hen

ovation for Mr. Murphy who was
in the audience, He was repeatedly

"lii theatrical circles 111 big ag
gregation of almost two score men
is considered a star attraction. Al
though classed as amateurs ,-iml
priding themselves on that classili
cation, nevertheless th u y are ama
teurs in name only. Several years
of faithful work under skilled di
rectors, and numerous tours in the
northern and southern circuits,
have brought the cluhs to a high
degree of excellence and leave them
unrivaled in their particular line of
work. During their tour of Cali
fornia and the Coast- last year, the
Stanford students made such a fa
vorable impression that the press
regarded them as the best attrac
tion of the season.
'•The fact that these talented
young men can tour the Coast year
after year under their own manage
ment and win greater popularity
and pla v to higger houses with each
advancing season is the hest evi
dence of their ability to compare
and compete with the hest travel
ing combinations of the profession.
In fact, no professional team could
render college music with the vim
and perfection of the students them
selves. It is something that only
college surroundings and strong,
fresh, young male voices can at
tain.-'— Seattle /V>«/-1 ntcll i<iciif('r,
