# TRAINING IN ORATORY.
## Persistence of the League's Executive Committee Rewarded. 
### 
President Jordan announces a
course in Forensics and Oral De
bate will be offered in the Univer
sity, beginning with the first of next
semester and continuing through
the year. The course will be in
charge of Professor Lathrop, and
lie will be assisted by some man
yet to he secured and added to the
faculty. The following communi
cation was received today from Pro
fessor Lathrop in regard to the de
buting interests at Stanford:
Hid it or Daily Palo Alto.
Sir: It. will afford the members
of the University pleasure to learn
that the President has made ar
rangements by which it will here
after be possible to give a year's
course in argumentative composi
tion, iDeluding oral debate. There
c i n be no question that t he interest
in debating evoked by the contest
with Berkeley has caused this
happy result. We owe the execu
tive committee of the Inter-Society
Debating League our thanks for
the energy with which they have
insisted on the importance of train
ing oratory.
lint while we are congratulating
ourselves, we may well take care that
we are glad of the right thing. I
fear that some of us are putting the
cart before the horse in the way we
think of all forms of public ac
tivity in which students engage -
athletics, music, debating, or
anything else. Success in all
such things is creditable, not in it
self, but as it results from the
spontaneous exhibition of a healthy
and noble spirit in the University.
Athletics are noble in so far as they
are manly sports, the bv-play of a
life generous both physically and
mentally. The succes of a musical
club is creditable in so far as it
represents a true unselfish interest
in music; and of course it is a
credit to a university that a body
of university men should travel
some thousands of miles and be
have everywhere like gentlemen.
In both athletics and music, mak
ing success the test of honor pro
duces professionalism. And pro
fessionalism in the by-play of a
student's activities is from begin
ning to end a discredit, and maybe
a disgrace. Among us, profession
alism in spirit mainly springs from
a desire to make a show for the
University before the world, partly
for the sake of making a show,
without regard to the spontaneous
ness and genuineness of the spirit
exhibited. The word advertise
ment has been applied to these
shows of all kinds. And the very
idea is something of an insult to
the high dignity of the University.
The same judgment appears to
me to be valid with regard to de
bating Success is honorable so
far as it exhibits three things: a
genuine unforced interest in debate,
a spirit in the general life of the
University which leads to argu
mentative power, and a good train
ing in the ordinary courses in ora
tory. Success is dishonorable if it
comes from any sort of artificial
assistance or forcing. Therefore
when courteously invited by the
executive committee of the Inter-

Society Debating League to take
part in coaching the contestants, I
felt constrained to reply that I re
garded coachings as illegitimate.
Accordingly I regard it as espec
ially fortunate that we are now to
have more work in debating in the
regular course of things. Whether
we ever win a debate or not, we
may assure ourselves that the Uni
versity recognizes the importance
of the subject, and that every man's
best efforts are appreciated by his
fellows. Respectfully yours,
11. 15. Lathrop.
