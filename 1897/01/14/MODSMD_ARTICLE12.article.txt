We witfh to enter a protest against
the use that is made of the word
"co-ed" in reference to the women
students of the University. Only
this week there came among our
exchanges a paper containing a
half-tone cut of Roble gymnasium,
to which was appended the title:
"Co-eds' gymnasium on the cam
pus.' 1 No one who rightly under
stands the origin and significance
of the term would think of apply
ing it to a single part of the students
of this University; in an etymo
logical sense, perhaps, all are "co
eds," as women here are accorded
the same privileges and opportun
ities as men and on an equal footing.
Hut we can not hope that a literal
interpretation of the term is always
intentioned. The time has not yet
come when all remembrance of its
origin and of the circumstances
which gave rise to it are forgotten.
So it is incumbent upon us to dis
countenance as far as possible its
use.
