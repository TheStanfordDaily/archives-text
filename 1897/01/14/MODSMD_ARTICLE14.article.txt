### 
The Choral Society will begin its
work this semester with an invita
tion concert tendered the members
by Mr. Pasmore, assisted by the
Euterpi Quartet of San Francisco
and others. At this concert the
plans for the semester will be an
nounced. The Chorus will prob
ably give a series of three concerts
this semester, one of which will be
on the campus, the others to be
given in San Francisco and San
Jose respectively.
Membership in the Chorus is
open to everybody who can satisfy
the very slight requirementsj[as to
ear and voice, and a fee of $2.50 is
required. The fee charge is neces
sary in order to pay the director
and the accompanist and to com
plete the purchase of the grand pi
ano now in the chapel. A member
ship of at least one hundred and
fifty is necessary both to pay ex
penses and to properly handle the
music the Chorus has taken up.
At the present time the outlook
is promising, if the students take
an active interest in the work, and
the officers anticipate little trouble.
The first rehearsal will be held in
the chapel on Thursday evening,
.lan. 21, at 7:80, when the Chorus
will be formally organized.
