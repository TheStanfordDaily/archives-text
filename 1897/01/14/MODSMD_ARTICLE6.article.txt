ternoon on "Some diseases of child
ren and llieir effect upon the mind"

terested in pedagogical studies.
The lecture was of great value and
general interest. She spoke inMih
stance as follows:
Bright children often return to
school after an illness, such as diph
theria and scarlet fever, dull and
stupid. The reason for this is that
while the child appears well ihe af
fected parts are swollen or enlarged.
1 n this condition they press upon
blood vessels which supply the
brain, and llius destroy mental
vigor. Mouth-breathing, nervous
depression, deafness, and other ab
normal conditions frequently re

suit from adnate growths. Exam
inations made among the children
lof the slums of New York show
! that four out of live were afflicted
: with deafness from such causes.
| After the removal of these growths
j great mental activity generally en
| sues.
Mental obtuseness was also traced
! to diseases of the thyroid gland and
insufficient nourishment. Strain
| inu of the eyes is a frequent cause
of physical and mental disorder.
It can be remedied by proper
glasses. Times occur when the
whole energy of the child is devoted
to growth. At these periods the
brain should be allowed to rest.
