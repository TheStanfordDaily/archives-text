# CONCERT FOR CHARITY.
## Musical Clubs Will Play for "Examiner's" Sick Children Fund. 
### 
Since the return of the Glee and
Mandolin Clubs from the Northern
tour, Manager Brown has been ne
gotiating with the managing editor
of the Examiner in regard to a con
cert to be given by these organiza
tions for the benefit of the Sick
Children's Fund. Arrangements
have been made whereby a concert
will be given in San Francisco on
the evening of January 80, and the
principal numbers of the program
will be furnished by the (ilee and
Mandolin Clubs. This is a very
opportune time for such an enter
tainment, since I lie clubs are in ex
cel lent condition after the constant
practice of the past month. The
California Theater has been secured
for the occasion and will undoubt
edly contain as large an audience
as could be desired.
