Thu rt*<iut'st from the Examiner
that the Stanford Musical Clubs
give a concert in San Francisco at
an early date for the benefit of
charity conies as a high compli
ment to the talent of the members.
The glee and mandolin clubs of the
I'niversity of California, just at
home from a successful tour, could
have been secured for the purpose
at a much less expense by reason
of their nearness to the city. No
doubt the success of the recent tour
made by our clubs was the cause of
the selection, which is a source of
satisfaction to all students as well
as to the individual members of the
clubs. Although there will be no
financial gain if the offer is ac
cepted, the participants would give
time and talent in a cause whose
worthiness is apparent to all.
