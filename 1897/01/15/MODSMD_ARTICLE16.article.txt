On Thursday last four bills, all
of vital importance to ihe Univer
sity, were introduced in the Gen
eral Assembly nt Sacramento.
These are brought forward by
Messrs. Malcolm, Seavvell, Dibble,
and other warm friends of the in
stitution. The general purpose of
these bills is to relieve the institu
tion from unjust discrimination
and burdensome taxation arising
from statutes framed before the
I'Diversity was founded and before
Governor Stanford's magnificent
gift to the state brought a new ele
ment into the public education.
It is possible now for each student
to render the University a signal
service by writing to ask the help
of his home representative in the
Assembly in behalf of these wise
and just reforms; each student has
some degree of influence with his
representative and t he influence can
never be more helpful than now.
California is the only state in the
civilized world that taxes a public
institution resting on private en
dowment. It is ihe only one in
which the resources of universities,
academies of science, and labor
atories of research find their in
comes frittered away in taxation.
All that the funds of the Univer

sity can earn are needed for its
work, and this work naves the state
many thousands of dollars eacli
year. No friend of public educa
tion will he found opposed to any
of these hills. Every friend of
Stanford University will he found j
in full accord with the propositions!
to extend the scope and strengthen |
the work of the great university of
California. The interest of one
university is that of the other and
every one who wishes well to the
state rejoices in the progress of
either.
