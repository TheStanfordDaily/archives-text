# Women at German Universities.
## 
### 
The prejudice against admitting
women to the universities still sur
vives to a considerable extent in
Germany. Women are admitted to
lectures in the University of Berlin,
subject to various restrictions and
only as non-matriculates. More
than forty women, most of them
American, have applied for permis
sion to attend courses there this
year. One of these had lectured in
America before going to Europe.
One of the professors at the Uni
versity of Berlin refuses to admit
women even under the conditions
imposed by the curators of the uni
versity; he has announced that he
will not permit women to attend
his lectures on Art History this
winter.
Some German institutions, how
ever, are not so narrow. Two
women, whose request to study
medicine was refused, have been ad
mitted by the medical faculty of
the University of Halle. The rec
tor of the University of Masburg
decided that women might attend
lectures at that institution on pre
sentation of a permit from the min
ister of education, provided thecon
sent of the respective lecturers is
first obtained.
The oldest society of college wo
men in Europe, as far as the writer
knows, is one formed in Zurich in
IJSN7 by students in the high
schools and the polytechnic in that
city. 11 consists of Germans prin
cipally, but some English and
American women also belong to it.
Kussians and other Eastern Euro
peans, having fewer common inter
ests with these, have formed associ
ations of their own. The society
corresponds with many prominent
European and American women's
educational institutions, and dis
cusses all the questions of the day
that concern the modern women's
movement. It exists under the
special patronage of the rector, and
its staff of officers is composed of
representatives from all the differ
ent departments.â€” The Echo.
