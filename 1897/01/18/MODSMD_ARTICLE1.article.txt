# UNWISE RESTRICTION.
## Dr. Jordan Writes of the Effect of Taxing Public Institutions. 
### 
Concerning the hills recently in-;
trod need in the Legislature for the I
relief of Stanford University, I'resi-j
dent Jordan makes the following
st;item(.'i) t:
hi none of the Eastern states and i
none of the countries of Europe are|
universities, whether of public or j
private foundation, subject to tax- i
ation. The general rule regarding
such matters is that all institutions'
which are not for the purpose of
making money and of which the!
income is all devoted to public pur-!
poses, as those of education, scien- j
tific investigation, or popular en- 1
lightenment, shall be free from the
burdens of taxation. In all of the
states, so far as 1 know, except Cal
ifornia. colleges, public libraries,
museums, and academies of science
are also exempt. If our constitu-1
tion was amended so as to exempt
endowed universities, public libra
ries, colleges, and museums outside
of sectarian control, and of which
the whole income is devoted to pub
lic service, fiom taxation, the
change would be a wise one.
There is no other state in the
Union that receives outside gifts in
so cold a spirit as California, and
for that reason there is no large
state which has received so few
gifts. This i< not because the state
is reallv unfriendly, but because its
constitution and statutes were
framed before these matters came
to be considered. For instance,
when Mr. Rockefeller founded the
University of Chicago it was ex
empted from taxation and the citi
zens of Chicago furnished all the
buildings, duplicating dollar for
dollar the millions which Rocke
feller gave. Mr. Stanford in mak
ing a larger gift than Mr. Rocke
feller's exacted nothing in return
and has received nothing. It would
be fitting as a graceful act <>112 recog
nition for the state, which has al
ready sent upwards of three thou
sand students to Stanford Univer
sity for their education, to relieve
the endowment of the University
from taxation. Already through
the generous way in which Mr.
Rockefeller's gift has been treated
the University of Chicago is able to
expend twice as much each year as
Stanford, though the original gift
was less.
The State of New York received
Mr. Cornell's gift of a million dol
lars in the same generous spirit,
and has added in one way or an
other some four millions to the
original endowment, besides freeing
it completely from taxation.
A few years ago Dr. Dohrn and
his Herman associates established
in the city of Naples an institution
for studying the natural h story of
the sea. Naples at once exempted
the institution trom taxation, gave
it a site comprising an acre or more
nf frontage in one of its finest parks,
duplicated the buiding, doubling its
capacity, and aided it materially in
other ways.
Without going into detail I may
say that if Stanford University had
been offered-to anv large Eastern
city or to any city of Europe, ar
rangements could have been made
without diflicultvlo duplicate its
buildings and release its endow

ment from taxation. In California,
however, out of its present income
of one hundred and fifty thousand
dollars, more than thirty thousand
dollars each year is taken for state
and county taxes, and the balance
of the two hundred thousand dollars
representing its annual cost of
maintenance is taken from Mrs.
Stanford's private means — pin
money which she had saved up for
the building of kindergartens and for
additions to the museum. As fast
as she is aide to get control of the
balance of her husband's estate
it will doubtless lie turned over to
the University; but with the in
creased income the taxes also in
crease. On the willingness of the
state to relieve the institution of
this burden in great measure de
pends its future growth. Thirty
thousand dollars a year saved in
the income of the University means
much. The continuance of several
of its most important departments,
as Mining Engineering and Law,
depends on this saving.
For the state to tax endowed in
stitutions of public utility like
Stanford University, the Academy
of Sciences, theThroop Polytechnic
School, ami the Lick School of Me
chanical Arts, is to rob its own
pockets. It takes money from the
highest use to put it to a lower.
"A dollar in a university," Emer
son says, "is worth more than a
dollar in a jail.'"
In the original statute under
which the University was founded
it is provided that the income is to
be forever devoted to the purposes
of education, "non-sectarian," and
so far as may be, "free"; in other
words, to the same purposes as are
reached by the public school sys
tem of the state. You will notice
also that by the constitution of the
University its trustees are required
to make an annual report of their
actions to the Governor of the State
of California. I n case of failure on
the part of the trustees to conduct
this trust as a public trust should
be conducted, as, for example, if
they should force sectarian tests,
then it is the duty of the state to
take possession of the property and
carry out as a trust the intention of
the grantor. In other words, Mr.
Stanford arranged to make the
University property practically a
gift to the state, but put its control
in the hands of a board of trustees
so that it could never be influenced
by the political changes taking
place instate affairs; while on the
other hand he left it to the State of
California to see that the property
was forever devoted to its proper
uses.
