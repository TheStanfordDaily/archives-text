Up to this time only three
persons have entered their names
for the Carnot Preliminary Debate.
The faculty committee in charge
hus accordingly postponed the time
of closing the lists and appealed to
the executive committee of the In
ter-Society Debating League to exert
their efforts toward awakening in
terest in the Carnot contest. That
committee met Friday afternoon and
passed resolutions requesting each
of the debating societies to select
two men for the Carnot Prelimi
naries, and asking the Executive
Committee of the Associated Stu
dents to elect four debaters at large
from the student body. It is
thought that this will draw men
into the contest who would not
enter of their own accord.
It is surprising that so little in
terest is being shown in the Carnot
Debate. It is simply a repetition of
last year's experience. The debate
takes place in our own chapel this

year and Stanford people will be
greatly disappointed if Berkeley
takes the medal right before our
eyes. The Intercollegiate Debate
it is an important affair, but
should not monopolize our atten
tion. Considerable importance at
taches also to the Carnot Debate.
That medal should come to a Stan
ford man this year!
