The lack of interest in the Car
not Debate has been noticed many
times in these columns and not
without reason, but a circumstance
has recently come to light which
seems to account, in some measure
at least, for the reluctance of candi
dates to prepare for the contest this
year. Several of those who handed
in their names at the Preliminaries
have been compelled to withdraw
for lack of accessible references. It
was found after an exhaustive
search in company with one of the
promoters who made out the list of
references that almost all the books
referred to had been taken from
the library. It is not known
where the books are, but some en
thusiastic debater is probably
"sinking" them for his own use.
The debate is close at hand and
any one who is holding books
either wantonly or carelessly should
realize the urgent necessity of re
turning them at once.
