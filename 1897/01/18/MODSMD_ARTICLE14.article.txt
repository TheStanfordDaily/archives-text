# Sunday Sermon.

### 
The sermon Sunday morning
was delivered by Bishop \V. F.
Nichols of San Francisco. He took
his text from St. John vii, 17. He
said in part:
All historical matter groups
around two points, two movements.
The tirst is a Christward movement
toward mankind, and the second is
a movement of mankind Christ
ward. We must not look at one of
these irrespective of the other or
the total result is obliquity of vision.
If anyone becomes wholly absorbed
in evangelicism the result is a nar
rowness which regards all dissent
ers from it ms obdurate and irre
claimable. It is as if the seed
planted were all and the soil noth
ing, as if the faculty were all and
the students naught. On the other
hand, if I only study humanity
and correlate facts, 1 take no cog
nizance of the great ameliorating
agency of Christianity. The two
are co-operative. They play into
each other naturally.
The push of humanity is under
stood to be toward what they call
prayers, but the road to it is in
doubt until the light of the gospel
shows the path of progression.
Burden-bearers and men of toil
of every kind everywhere are mov
ing forward to the call of Christ.
There is a movement upward to
wards an ideal, and the workers are
urged onward by a a force behind
them. This movement cancels self
ishness and creates and turns the
efforts of all. to the elevation of
mankind. Augustine, the great
theologian, said: "'0 God, Thou hast
made us for Thyself, and the heart
will never rest until it resls in
Thee." Then he spoke as a trib
une of humanity and not as a theo
logian. This one example illus
t rales how the exponents of human
ity have expressed themselves in
concise language that the human
heart seeks rest in (rod and is rest
less until it finds it.
The two parts of activity are
judgment and will. Judgment
en a I ties understanding, and the will
is the force back of it. A great
deal of emphasis lias always been
and now is put upon judgment, to
the neglect of will. There is disease
in all the departments of human
life. We know it and can locate
it, but have not the will power to
cure it. While there is a great
deal in the study of judgment,
what we need today is a mastery of
the will as a dominating factor in
humanity. Even our universities
are training judgment to the neg
lect of the will. There are more
failures of college men in the world
today due to the lack of will than
to lack of judgment. A man may
have good judgment when he grad
uates, but may not have the will or
nerve to follow his judgment for the
betterment of his fellows. Those
who have found the true ethical
harmony never had the least
trouble about the truth of Christ.
If any man wills to do His will,
the doctrine shall be shown him.
