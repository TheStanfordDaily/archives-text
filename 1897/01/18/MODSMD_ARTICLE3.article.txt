# THE 						RETURN CONCERT.
## Musical Clubs Give an Enjoyable Evening of Entertainment. 
### 
Stanford students gave the Glee I
and Mandolin Clubs a warm wel
come at their return concert'in the!
chapel last Friday night. We are
not often favored with such ainu- i
sical treat, which fact was fully ap
preciated by everyone present, as;
shown by the hearty and enthusias-1
tic applause and encores tendered j
each number on the program. The j
first number, "Dear Old Stanford,"
enlisted all the college spirit and
enthusiasm, and was heartily en-1
cored. Mr. Riley's monologue kept j
the audience in a continuous up
roar of laughter. Mr. Riley pos
sesses marked ability as a dra
matic reader and impersonator,
lie is very pleasing and magnetic.
His numbers were all very much
enjoyed.
Mr. Dillon's character imper
sonations were especially good, and
kept the audience in constant
laughter. lie was especially clever
in bis rendition of negro songs. He
is decidedly strong in dialect work.
Mr. Abbott's selection from Carmen
was sung with pleasing effect and
elicited warm applause. The selec
tion was rather too heavy for his
voice, and it was very unfortunate
that the accompaniment suggested
too much a piano solo, and instead
of being a support for the voice
nearly drowned it.
The good work done by the Glee
Club showed itself in many ways.
The blending and harmonizing of
twenty-five voices is a difficult
thing and requires much labor and
in this respect the Glee Club de
serves much credit. Nearly all the
numbers were of a light, gay order
and were sung with much vim and
life. There is room for much im
provement in the club's rendition
of Dudley Buck's "Annie Laurie."
It lacked that artistic finish which
conies only through good leader
ship. It was sung with little ex
pression and blending of voices.
The program would have been bet
ter perhaps if a few more selections
of "a higher order had been inter
spersed. Theelub is capable of doing
work of a higher class, and cer
tainly Stanford students can appre
ciate good music and should have
the best there is.
The Mandolin Club selections
were excellent. The club is doing
good work this year, and the num
bers were rendered with an expres
sion and ease that made them par
ticularly enjoyable. About one
hundred dollars was cleared.
