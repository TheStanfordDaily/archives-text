We positively refuse to accept
copy for this paper after four
o'clock. Adherence to business
principles as well as to the rules of
the profession makes this urgent
upon us. Last semester the paper
might be looked for any hour be
tween eight at night and seven in
the morning. It was not unusual
that the foreman should find the
forms a column or a half column
short as late as nine o'clock, and
the paper was delayed until the
staff could be routed out or some
thing dug up to till the space. If
the people get used to this state of
affairs they are unfortunate; we
don't propose to run the paper that
way. At four o'clock enough copy
to fill the issue is in, the staff
leaves the office, and the paper is
"up." As soon thereafter as pos
sible the Daily Palo Alto comes
off the press.
