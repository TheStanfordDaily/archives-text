The attendance at the Prelimi
nary Jebates bhould l>e large, indi

eating, as it will, the amount of in
terest in debating. Our debaters
require large and sympathetic au
diences, just as well-tilled bleachers
were necessary to encourage and put
life into our football men. If the
speakers find themselves talking to
unresponsive benches their speeches
soon lack vigor and power, their ar
dor is cooled, and the zest of the
orator, attempting to move the
minds and hearts of men, is totally
absent. Without a large, enthusi
astic Stanford audience the debaters
will lose the experience gained in
appearing before a body of people,
interested and intelligent, ready to
grasp a speaker's meaning, and
ever engaged in weighing and bal
ancing his arguments. Such an au
dience would provide a powerful
stimulus to any debater, inspiring
him to his best efforts. Such an
audience should be present at each
of the Preliminary Debates.
