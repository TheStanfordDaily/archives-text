# Need of a National University.

In the January Forum President
Jordan contributes an article on
''The Urgent Need of a National
University." Arguing from the
Germanic influence which has
manifested itself in our school sys
tem, in the growth of universities,
in the rise of the spirit of investiga
tion, and in the realization of the
value of truth among us, he states
that what is needed to govern this
further and make it strong and ef
fective is the presence of a great
university upon which shall he con
centrated the nation's best efforts.
There have been epoch-making
•events in this century but the great
deed of the century remains to be
done. It is not to supply a local
need that a national university is
contemplated, but the need of the
nation. A great university in
America would be a school for the
study of civic freedom. A great
university at the capital of the Re
public would attract the free
minded of all the earth. It would
draw men of all lands to the study
of democracy and would tend to
make the workings of democracy
worthy of respectable study. The
problems and lessons of the New
World could here be studied and
adequately applied.
A very different function is con
ceived for such an institution from
that which universities of general
or technical culture now hold. It
would be ths place for the training
of investigators and of men of ac
tion, admitting no student who is
under age or who has not a definite
purpose to accomplish. In this
way it would stand in the same re
lation to the universities of the
country that is held by the Univer
sities of Berlin or Leipzig.
Dr. Jordan discountenances the
idea that partisan influences would
be able to control the National
University were it established. Be
ing built and maintained as a
national institution, separated from
sectarian, sectional, or factional
spirit, nothing could prevent its be
ing governed in the same way that
the Smithsonian Institution and
the National Museum now are; no
accusation of partisanship or favor
itism has ever been brought against
»Mtber of th»se; and with a non-par
tisan board of control, such as the
plan provides, the university could
not be otherwise than free. Its
faculty could respond only to the
noblest influences, and that
scholars and investigators should
become contaminated by political
influences is an anomaly that has
never yet made its appearance. A
scholar is a free man and will al
ways remain so. On the other
hand, there is reason to hope that
much good might result from the
presence at Washington of trained
economists, historians, and jurists.
It would in itself be an influence
for good legislation and good ad
ministration greater than any that
we know. By this means we shall
create the best guarantee of the
prosperity of our Republic. For
in the long run, the voters of the
nation must be led by its wisest
men.
