# ANTHROPOMETRY.
## A
						New System of Measurements Introduced at Encina Gymnasium. 
### 
A system of anthropometry by
means of the camera is soon to be
tested at Stanford. A photogra
pher's studio has been fitted up in
the north gallery of Encina gym
nasium. This side has been chosen
because the light is best fitted for
the purpose, and because the nice
adjustment of the instruments will
be less interfered with by expansion
and contraction through the heat
of the sun.
Light is admitted through frosted
glass windows and is cast upon the
subject by various screens so as to
obtain the clearest possible outline.
The photographer's object is to ob
tain pictures which shall be valu
able for scientific, rather than ar
tistic purposes. In front of a dark
background is a perfectly level plat
form revolving on a pivot at the
center. At a proper distance from
this is fastened the camera.
The subject stands upon the plat
form with his feet so placed by
means of cleats that a vertical line
from Ihe pivot passes through the
center of his body. By means of a
black screen subdivided into square
centimeters and square inches every
dimension in the view taken is ex
actly indicated and any peculiarity
plainly defined. Down stairs a
very well equipped dark room has
1 >een constructed.
The general features of this sys
tem of anthropometry have been
employed in various places fora
number of years. A somewhat
similar system is in use at the Uni
versity of California, and Mr. S. G.
Bailie, who is directing the work
here, made some ex peri inents in the
same direction at the Whittier State
School, where he occupied the posi
tion which Mr. 1 letherington, last
year's gymnasium instructor at
Stanford, now holds. But the work
to be done here has some new fea
tures, and in no institution has all
the work front beginning to end
been done in a university and by
university people as it will be here.
The advantages of this system
over the old method with calipers
and tape-measure are numerous.
There is no chance for the slight
variations due to different measur
ers; the measurements are easily
classified, and by means of com
posite photographs the general
average of different types and the
results of different sorts of exercise
and athletic, games can be ascer
tained.
Dr. Wood has been interested in
this system for some time, and it is
due to him that the work was under
taken and carried on. Mr. Bailie
has spent considerable time and
care in collecting the apparatus and
in personally directing all the work
so far done, lie will have charge
of the further workings of the sys
tem.
The experiments to be performed
will be done as special work in the
department of Hygiene, being
known as Course 12. The measure
ments will be made general just as
soon as arrangements permit.
