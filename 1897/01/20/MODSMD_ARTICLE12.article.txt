From the outset it has been our
purpose to make this paper careful,
exact, and in no way misleading.
\\ hatever olher merit it may pos
sess, the paper will speak for itself.
It is with regret, therefore, that we
have to acknowledge the publica
tion of one or two notices that were
erroneous. Compelled as we are to
make lip the entire paper between
the hours of two and four in the af
ternoon, it is at times hard to pre
vent inaccuracies from creeping in.
We trust, however, that no serious
inconvenience or confusion h;is re
sulted from anything published in
these columns, nor that we have
caused anyone to lose faith in our
purpose.
