The large attendance at the de
late last evening shows that there
is going to he a much increased in
terest taken in this line of activity
at Stanford this year. This is
gratifying to those who hope that
we may henceforth win victories on
ttie rostrum just as we have in the
past won them on the gridiron. No
sort of intercollegiate contest can
ever he won unless it is supported
hy the students at large. The
reason why we win football victo
ries is that the students and pro
fessors here believe in football and
do all in their power to back up the
team, even if it lie at some inconve
nience. The growing tendency to
give our debaters more of this same
support should he encouraged.
