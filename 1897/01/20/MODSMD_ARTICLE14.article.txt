A communication has been re
ceived at this oftice suggesting the
holding of a student body meeting
to make a formal petition to the
Legislature praying for the passage
of the hills affecting the University.
We do not believe that this would
add much weight to the plea that
has already been made. Everyone
would take it for granted that the
students here are in favor of this
legislation; whatever we do as a
body would only emphasize a fact
that is already known. By far the
best plan is that every student who
has an acquaintance among the leg
islators should write to him urging

his support. This personal commu
nication will awaken a personal
and individual interest and will be
of great service in making an un
derstanding of the situation clear
to the members of the legislative
body.
