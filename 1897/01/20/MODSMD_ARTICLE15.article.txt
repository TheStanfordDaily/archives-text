Advices from Vale make it ap
parent that we are not alone in our
attempt to free our institution from
unwise restriction. The difficulty
there is peculiarly significant in that
it arises in the form of an increase
in the regular tax list. The uni
versity has had to pay taxes, but
they were not exorbitant; now the
city authorities seek to fasten upon
the university an additional bur
den, more than it has ever had to
pay before.
With us taxation has been of
long continuance and at all times
disproportionate. It has been a
steady and unremitting obstacle to
the University's growth and en
largement. In proportion as our
endowment grows the burden be
comes heavier to bear.
Our sympathies go out to our
sister university, with the hope that
both Vale and Stanford may be
granted relief from the unwise
measures that threaten to impede
their full and free development.
