# Crippling Our Universities.

Unjust and unwise taxation is
being attempted by the city of New
Haven in its proposal to increase
the tax list of Yale from $58,916 to
$439,782 for the current year.
What prompts this spirit is un
known, for such measures have
never been proposed before. Sev
eral of the leading newspapers of
New Haven are championing the
cause of the university. Notably
among these is the Register, from
which, as quoted in the Yale News,
the following is extracted:
"From the standpoint of self
ishness New Haven should seek in
every possible way to lighten the
burdens of the university, and
should resist, as it would a vicious
attack upon its city government,
every attempt to embarrass its
growth and the consequent
fulfillment of its important
mission. Yale, through her stu
dents and professors, has put
into circulation here millions of
dollars, thereby sustaining and
adding to the prosperity of our
merchants and our lodging-house
class. New Haven could
ford to give outrightto Yaleeach year
the amount of money this new tax
list seeks to recover for its treasury,
than do one thing to interrupt its
progress and weaken its equipment.
There is not a city in this great
country which would not gladly
agree to exempt Yale from all tax
ation and to, in part if not in whole,
furnish it with a modern equip
ment, if it could acquire with it the
advantages New Haven has already
acquired from the long association,
and which it is adding to every
year it continues. Let no step be
taken to embarrass Yale in response
to a short-sighted and mistaken plea
that it be taxed as any other busi
ness institution is. Leave Yale
alone. It is worth to New Haven
every dollar of revenue apparentlv
lost."
