The Choral Society will hold its
first meeting and rehearsal tomor
row (Thursday) evening, to effect

an organization for this semester.
The director is especially anxious
fora full attendance at the earlier
meetings in order to hring the Cho
rus into form for concerts to be
given about the middle of the se
mester, a membership of upwards
of 150 being necessary from a finan
cial as well as from a musical
point of view. The fee for the se
mester will be $2.50, the discrimi
nation of last, semester having beeu
done away with. A regular bus
will be run from Palo Alto on
Thursday evenings, final arrange-!
inents to be made at this first re
hearsal.
The music to be studied this se
mester will be much like that of I
last year, but with the large attend-1
a nee which is anticipated, and the
assistance of the Apollo Club of i
Sim Francisco at the concerts, a |
much better effect will be obtained, i
The Chorus has had a hard time to
keep even so far, but now, with the
increased interest, success is as
sured, and the organization will be
able to do work which will be cred-j
itable to the University.
