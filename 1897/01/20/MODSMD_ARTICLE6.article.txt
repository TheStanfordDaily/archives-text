# THE 						FIRST DEBATE.
## Students and Professors Interested in the Coming Contest. 
### 
The first of the series of Prelimi
naries for the Intercollegiate De
bate was held last evening in the
chapel. The subject was: "Resolved,
That the use of injunction in cases
prominently affecting public in
terest is dangerous and unneces
sary.'' Prof. Abbott in calling the
meeting to order gave a short ex
position of the subject, stating that
it was a question whether the use
of injunctions was not dangerous
to public welfare.
The first speaker on the affirma
tive was John M. Boss, '97, who
gave the history of injunction,
pointing out the changes it had
undergone and its present function,
which is to make the courts issuing
the same executive as well as judi
cial bodies. He also claimed that
by the use of injunction the con
stitutional right of trial by jury
was done away with and men were
often placed twice in jeapordy for
the same offence.
The next speaker was Roth rock,
".IS, who argued for the negative.
11 is deli very was good and he had the
attention of the audience through
out his speech. He took the stand
that the use of injunction was nec
essary to prevent irreparable in
jury, and that punishment for con
tempt, which was used as an argu
ment against, injunction, was nec
essary for its enforcement.
Hull, '98. spoke emphatically of
the wrongs endured by Pullman
employees, justified the strikers in
their combined action against the
railroads, and claimed that injunc
tions were often dangerous because
of the tyranny of the courts and be
cause defendants were allowed no
counsel.
Wells, '97, argued that injunction
was constitutional, and was the
only remedy that could be applied
to certain cases, and that this was
the quickest, safest, and most satis
factory process in cases of emer
gency.
Dixon, '00, summed up the points
made by the affirmative, and de
voted some time to answering the
arguments of the negative.
Following him, Miss Stebbins, '97,
closed the debate in a carefully pre
pared speech for the negative. She
recounted the principal arguments
that bad been made during the
evening for and against the use of
injunction, and was particularly
skillful in answering those of the
opposing side.
The chapel was well filled, and
the speakers were followed with
earnest attention throughout the
progress of the debate.
