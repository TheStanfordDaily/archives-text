The Ssiti Francisco papers have
expressed themselves us follows re
garding President Jordan's state
ment of the legislation needed to
relieve the University:
''It is hoped that before the Legis
lature adjourns California will have
been put in line with other states
in her hospitality to educational
and charitable benefaction*. If
private generosity is willing to re
lieve the state of a large part of its
proper work, the state should cer
tainly be willing to allow the gifts
to be applied unimpaired to their

objects instead of taking toll of
them as they go."â€”Examiner.
''Sensible people will concur in
! the views expressed by President
l-Jordan that it is desirable for the
| state to encourage rather than to
I discourage bequests for educational
purposes. The rule (that institu
tions which are not for purposes of
making money and of which the
income is all devoted to public pur
poses, should be free from the bur
dens of taxation) is a sound rule,
and it, is an extraordinary case
lof legislative aberration that Cal-
I ifornia should have taken exactly
i the opposite course."- Chronicle.
"This showing certainly is not
creditable either to the wisdom or
the gratitude of the state. It is
not grateful to Senator Stanford
and to Mrs. Stanford to thus t;ix
the benefits which they have de
sired to confer upon the people.
Neither is it the part of wisdom to
take money from a university,
where it serves the highest use, and
! apply it to a lower one. There
: lief asked for should lie given at
once." ('all.
