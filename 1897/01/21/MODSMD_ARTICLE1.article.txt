The concert given under the di- i
rection of.lf. B. I'asniore last even
ing was largely attended and proved |
to be very successful. The Euterpe]
(Quartette consisting of Mrs. Gard-i
ner, Misses Warden, Foster, and I
r 1 • •
Waters was excellent; their voices
were clear and beautiful, and luir-!
monized very nicely. They were |
especially good in the Serenade and ;
Here's a Health. The encore to j
(he latter, a heautiful lullaby song,
was very pleasing. Mrs Gardner's
rendition of Gounod's Ave Maria
with violin accompaniment was
very good. Her voice was sweet
and clear, and her high notes were
taken with apparent ease.
The song from Cavalleria Rus
ticana by Miss Waters was excel
lent. Her voice is powerful and
well cultivated. Mr. Medley's
songs were greeted with much en
thusiasm. His rendition of the
Two Grenadiers brought down a
storm of applause, lie possesses a
tine voice and sings with a great
dea 1 of feeling.
The solos by Miss Hulme and
Miss Ferral were very good and
much enjoyed by all. The honors
of the evening were carried off bv
the two little girls, Mary I'asniore
and Theresa Ehrman, who played
the violin and piano. Their inter
pretation of Beethoven's Sonata in
F would have been creditable for
much older musicians. Mary I'as
niore plays the violin with so much
feeling and artistic effect that all
who hear her are delighted and
astonished with her ability. She
played the violin obligate for Mrs.
Gardner with perfect ease. The
way in which Theresa Ehrinan ex
ecuted Chopin's Waltz was no less
wonderful. Her accompaniments
were played exceptionally well.
Professor Lathrop made a short
address on the work done by the
Choral Society and some of its
plans for the future. He urged all
those who were interested in the
work to join ihe society, as it. is de
sirous that the membership shall lie
increased to lot) members. An in
vitation has been extended the so
ciety to unite with the San Fran
cisco Choral Society in giving a
grand concert in the near future.
They have also been asked to sing
at the Fiesta in San Francisco. The
Choral Society will organize this
evening in the chapel at 7:80.
