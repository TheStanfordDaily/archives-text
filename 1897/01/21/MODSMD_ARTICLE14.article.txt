An acknowledgement of the cour
tesy of the Examiner in selecting
our (ilee and Mandolin Clubs for
the Charity Concert in San Fran
cisco hits already been made in
these columns. Another graceful
compliment to the work of the
clubs has recently come from Mrs.

Stanford. In view of these facts
and since each club will be twice
called upon next week to uphold
the many favorable criticisms that
they have recently received, the
showing that the clubs make in San
Francisco is a matter of concern to
each student of the I Diversity.
The musical clubs have never be
fore been so prominently brought
before the public, and that their
work has been such as would jus
tify this prominence is indeed a
matter of pride to us all. It is to
be deeply regretted, therefore, that
some of the members of the clubs
are not showing the spirit that
should characterize them at this
time. The line of duty is as clearly
marked out in the musical organi
zations as it is in athletics, and the
man in the musical clubs who
should neglect to attend rehearsals
and go into a concert unprepared is
to be esteemed as the man in ath
letics who deserts his team on
the eve of a great contest. The
clubs are doing well and every ef
fort should be made to keep them
up to their high standard of excel
lence.
