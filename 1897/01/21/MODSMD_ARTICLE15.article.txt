Editor Daily Palo Alto: \\ r e
have started this term with, as we
think, a good move in our track
athletics. Captain Brown of the
track team has secured A1 Lean of
the Reliance Club as trainer for the
track men. He will begin his train
ing on March 1. Lean is well
known to Stanford athletes, as he
trained them to their splendid con
dition last fall. He holds one or
two professional records, and is
recognized as a trainer well ac
quainted with his work.
The baseball team is temporarily
crippled by the resignation of .Man
ager Alpheus Williams. We all
regret his action, and it is hoped
that he will reconsider his deter
mination. As the class games were
about to be played, this change may
delay somewhat the beginning of
the basebii 11 season.
A change has been made in our
administration in reference to the
otlioe of dean. Instead of one dean
for the whole university, a separate
dean for each college has been ap
pointed. Their duties consist of
issuing excuses, answering inquir
ies, and acting as advisors to all
students enrolled in their respective
colleges.
lhiring the Christinas vacation
the unexpected news came from
Atliens of the death of I)r. George
M. Richardson, our professor of
Classical Archaeology His death
is much felt, here, as he was a gen
tleman of refined and scholarly at
tainments and of unquestioned
ability in archaeological subjects,
the further studv of which had
dra\vn him to Athens.
The committee of the faculty has
nearly completed the arrangements
for tendering a public reception to
Prof, and Mrs. Le Conte at the
Hopkins Institute of Art on Febru
ary 8. A large number of invita
tions will be issued, including the
students of both California and
Stanford, as well as many promi
nent. men of the state.
Prof. Syle has written another
play which is known as "The Chap
lain's Revenge." it is the dramati
zation of one of Sir Walter Besant's
novels, and its performance will he
on the evening of Charter Day,
March '28. Ii is to be presented by
a cast entirely from the student
body, and it is hoped with as much
success as Prof. Svle's former work
"Love for Love."
At the junior class meeting yes
terday afternoon it was decided,
after much discussion, to leave to
the manager of the IHue and (inld
the option of receiving or rejecting
liquor "ads." for 98's Annual.
