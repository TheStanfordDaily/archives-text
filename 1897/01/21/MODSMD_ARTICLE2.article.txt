A bite number of the Outlook de
votes considerable attention to a
review of tbe articles on currency
reform that appealed in the Janu
arv Heriew of l>'< riric*. These ar
ticles, ten in number, were con
tributed by representatives of the
principal colleges and universities
of the country. Though the writ
ers differed in some respects, there
was a fairly good presentation of
the different views that have been
taken upon the financial question.
The variety of opinion is not
greater than could reasonably have
been expected, while the coincidence
of ideas is notewortby.
We quote a portion of the review:
Professor Koss of Leland Stanford
Pniversitv puts tersely and clearly
the problem. When the gold re

serve of $100,000,000 was fornied'in
1878, it furnished a sufficient bank
ing reserve of thirty percent, for
$44(5,000,000 greenbacks. Hut "by
1890 we had piled on it a second
story in the form of $820,000,000.
By 1898 we had added a third story
of $150,000,000 of new Treasury
notes paid out for bar silver. There
now rests on the reserve the crush
ing weight of over $820,000,000 of
obligation, a burden which it can
not and was never intended to
bear." Professor Boss proposes to
retire the $150,000,000 of Sherman
notes, because it would contract the
circulation only three sevenths as
much as the retirement of the
greenbacks would do, and because
the "bar silver behind them is now
perfectly useless for redeeming
them" ; and he proposes to leave
the $820,000,000 silver certificates
in circulation, but leave them pay
able, as now, in silver only. Thus
the Treasury would ''do what every
payer in this country can do use
its option of paying silver or gold
at its convenience in meeting its ex
penses." His plan seems to us the
most practicable and the most con
servative of any suggested. As sil
ver notes are not redeemable in
gold, the $820,000,000 silver notes
left outstanding need not imperil
the gold reserve; and as these silver
notes are receivable for taxes, which
amount to $450,000,000 annually,
they would be kept at par with gold
without being redeemed in gold.
