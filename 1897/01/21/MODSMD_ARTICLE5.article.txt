The attendance of 400 at the in
tercollegiate oratoriea 1 contest, com
pared with the crowd of 8,000 at
the football game on Thanksgiving
! day, shows that, however much we
may regret it, sports have a fascina
tion for the American people that:
is not shared hy intelleciua 1 con
i tests.
There is one feature of the case,
however, that is entirely overlooked
by most of those who comment
j upon it; that is that college foothail
games show the very highest order
|of sport, while college oratorical
I contests do not furnish the highest
I order of oratory. The youth is en
-1 tering upon, if not at, his prime
physically. The college debater, on
the other hand, is immature intel
lectually. In fact, he is still about
twenty-live years from his intellect
; ual prime. Since college athletes,
' therefore, play football better than
| college orators speak, it is not
I strange that people crowd to see
boys play football and do not crowd
|to hear boys speak.
There is of course more fascina
tion for Anglo-Saxon people in
i sports than in intellectual pursuits.
For one thing, the former are more
I easily followed by the audience and
|do more to entertain it. But it
i would lie absurd to argue from this
that the American people value
strength above intellect or even
above oratory. We have only re
cently seen the eagerness with which
people grapple with abstruse ques
tions and hang upon the words of
those who employ their eloquence
in the effort to elucidate them. â€”
