# Baseball Practice.
## 
### 
A large number of candidates
were out on the diamond this even
ing. The men are not yet in form
to begin heavy practice. Many of
them will need some hard, muscle
toughening exercise before begin
ning actual work. The practice for
the next few weeks will consist in
the main of batting and fielding, no
attempt being made to develop
team work until the men are in
good condition. New players are
responding well to Captain Thomp
son's ea 11, and more new candidates
than old players have appeared so
far. The question of tilling the
box is a puzzling one, and the posi
tion is one to which much atten
tion and t raining will have to be
devoted.
