Among other noteworthy features
that have characterized class elec
tions this semester is the inconspic
uous part occupied by the frater
nity issue compared with the prom
inence that has been given that is
sue in past years. Not long ago it
was hardly possible to hold an elec
tion of any sort without having this
issue raised immediately; and the
fact that a man was a member of a
(ireek letter society was considered
sufficient evidence that he should
be beaten. This year's elections
have demonstrated a falling off of
this spirit, and an apparent deter
mination to elect officers on some
other basis.
