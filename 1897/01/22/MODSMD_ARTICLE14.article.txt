The Executive Committee of the
student body met last night to hear
Treasurer Morrison's report, but
owing to illness Mr. Morrison was
notable to present the report to the
committee.
Mrs. M. G. Hood, \Y\ H. Irwin,
E. M. Hulme, and Mallory, '00, were
chosen to represent the student
body in the Carnot medal contest.
These, together with those already
chosen by the literary societies and
those voluntarily entered, make a
total of about thirteen, from among
whom.three will be chosen for the
final debate.
