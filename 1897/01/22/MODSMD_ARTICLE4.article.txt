The liev. Chas. 11. Brown of Oak
land, who preaches in the chapel
next Sunday, is a new comer to the
Coast, succeeding Dr. McLean as
pastor of the First Congregational
Church of Oakland. For the past
four years Mr. Brown has been over
the Win thro p Congregational
Church of Charlestown, Mass.,
while there refusing many invita
tions to go to other churches. A
writer in the ('oiuimiationulist says
of him:
"In the pulpit Mr. Brown is
unique. Like all men of native
force be has a style of his own.
Theological professors have left no
earmarks on him. The breeze of
the prairie blows through his ser
mons. He is vital, full of the milk
of human kindness, and instead of
boring people by dissecting theories
and balancing systems lie ministers
to life by keeping men close to the
great facts of revelation. He is a
preacher in downright earnest to
drive bis message home. He makes
a sensation, as every true preacher
does, not bv antics and additions,
but by the force of his ideas and
the nobility of bis spirit. His
language is blunt and simple. His
mind is intensely practical. lie
believes in bringing things to pass,
and things always come to pass
where he is. None of the odor or
starch of clericalism can be found
in his make-up."
Mr. Brown is a young man, and
was married just before coming to
California. He is very soon to take
his wedding trip abroad on a six
months, leave of absence.
