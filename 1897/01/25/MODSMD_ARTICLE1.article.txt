# CHAPEL SERMON.
## Interesting Address on the Purpose and Plan of Life. 
### 
Yesterday's sermon in the chapel
w:fs by Rev. Charles R. Brown,
1). 1)., of Oakland. The theme was
from the twelfth chapter of Luke,
"Life is more than meat." Dr.
brown is a pleasing speaker and
delivered his sermon in an off-hand
manner, without notes. His dis
course was intensely practical and
full of earnest thought.
The questions that seem to have
the most importance and promi
nence in the world today are, What
shall we eat, and what shall we put
on ourselves? These are the great
issues in the human campaign.
People make much of these and for
get about living. From the text,
then, are to be derived three les
sons: First, trust. The commer
cial spirit is in us from the very
start; we need to learn how to live,
and that is what Christ intended to
teach, that life is most important.
He used two striking illustrations,
of the lilies and of the ravens of
the field. "Consider the lilies,lie
said. This implied the trust we
must have in Cod and in His good
ness. Not the trust of idleness but
the, trust of faith. The other illus
tration. of the ravens, is a bold con
trast. The lily suggests lenity and
quietness and peace, and might
grace the altar of (iod, while the
raven is an uncannv bird: it was
considered evil among the Jews,
and everything about its habits and
its life suggests the nether world.
Some might say that we should
choose the golden mean between
these two; truth, however, does
not.lie with the golden mean but in
the recognition of the truth that
both teach. Lilies do not toil nor
spin but they work all the time;
tbev live out their lily life when
t hey do what God planned for them
to do. The ravens, too, live as they
are made to live, and they are
clothed and fed. So (iod has made
us, and if we live out the purposes
of our being we shall he clothed and
fed.
A man is to be a man; if he fol
lows the letter of God's word it will
kill him, but if he lives the spirit of
it he will be fulfilling the purposes
for which (iod made him. People
who are shrieking and crying about
t he conditions of life are people who
have not been true to the best im
pulses of their nature. So to be a
man one must live as (iod planned
him to live. The Christian life is
simply being what God made us to
lie, nothing more. Religion is sim
ply living out God's plan.
The second lesson is, that life is
always distinct from meat or the
material on which it lives. A man's
life consists not in the abundance
of the things he possesses but in
what he is. If he is not develop
ing and growing in Christian man
hood, then he is a failure. It does
not matter whether a man is rich
or poor; if he is thinking only of
the material upon which life is to
feed and not about bis own devel
opment, he is not living what God
meant him to be.
When we come to estimate men
we do not ask about these material
things, but whether they are mak
ing use of them to make themselves
more useful and helpful. When a

mni) dies we sometimes think more
of what lie left than of what he
took with him; hut man's true am
bition should he along the line of
perfect and holy development.
The third lesson is that life al
ways asserts its supremacy over
material and makes some use of it.
Environment must always yield to
the life put over it. The material
on which life feeds is all the same
until life comes to it and makes it
of use. So the lily asserts its
supremacy over the mud in which
it grows, and becomes pure and
white and beautiful. It does not
make so much difference about the
material; if a man makes his way
through with the right sort of life,
he will come out all right, and will
reach his full and perfect develop
ment in God's purpose. The man
who has in him the right sort of
stuff goes through it all with faith
and trust, and attains to (rod's
purpose in the end.
Life is not easy for any of us,
and yet it must be all right. The
lily is put down in the black mud,
and is given, life that it may take
this same mud and make lilies of
it. This is the gospel of the eternal
importance of the quality of life.
When this is right we mav laugh
in the face of circumstances. It
must be right. We should love and
obey God, and express that love
and obedience in prayer and wor
ship. The life that is right will
love (iod and love man, and when
it has this it will transform its en
vironment and make out of it
something like itself. Life then is
more than meat: make the life
right, and the material things will
all be turned to good account.
