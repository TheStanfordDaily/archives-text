The falling off in the attendance
!it the Preliminary Debute last Fri
day night was very noticeable, and
from the standpoint of the de
baters it was to be lamented. It is
no great pleasure to talk to empty
seats, and very little inspiration is
likely to come to a speaker under
such circumstances. It should be
remembered that these Prelim
inaries are of much importance to
the University and to its debating
interests for it is from the persons
appearing in these Preliminaries
that our debating team is to be
selected. Encouragement is as
necessary for good debating as it is
for good football playing, and we
should be as anxious to lend it to
the one as to the other when an
intercollegiate contest is drawing
near. This does not mean that
we give too much support to our
athletes. Far from that. For it
does not necessarily follow that the
awakening of an interest in one
kind of contest will relegate some
other to the background. In fact,
one of the most no'iceable features
of this year's preparation for de
bate is the enthusiasm shown by
our athletes in the desire to have
Uerkelev beaten on the rostrum
this vear.
