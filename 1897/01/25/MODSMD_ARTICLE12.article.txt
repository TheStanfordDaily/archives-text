The importance of responding to
the invitation of the people of San
Francisco and Oakland does not
seem to he realized hy some of the
individual members of our musi
cal clubs. The fact that the merit
of our clubs has been recognized is
a matter of pride to every loyal
student, but if the individual
musicians do not brace up this rec
ognition can not be less than a
calamity. It would never do for
Stanford to go to San Francisco
with the ranks of her clubs full of
vacancies. We have here a chance
to make a lasting impression on
the people of the city that will be
much to our credit. We have
taken the town once during this
college year, and it is safe to say
that the reputation then made has
not died out and is now in a con
dition to be clinched. This can
doubtless be done by a display of
the proper spirit on the part of our
musicians, leading to the rendition
of good programs on the dates of
invitation. This, together with the
spring athletics, our quota of which
we have some hope of winning,
should carry the tideall in our favor,
and make the w name of our Uni
versity one of high standing in the
minds of the people of the bay
cities.
