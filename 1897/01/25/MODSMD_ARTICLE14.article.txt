# Houston Hall.
## 
### 
The club house opened last year
at the University of Pennsylvania
has proved itself to be a splendid
success. It is not merely a dormi
tory, but is modeled and operated
after the manner of a modern met
ropolitan club house. The Penn
xi)lvaiiHtn of recent date comments
on the successs of the hall, and
suggests a new work which it
might undertake in bringing to
gether the alumni of the university
who reside near Philadelphia. This
contact between alumni and under
graduates would be of great advan
tage in that the students might
'"meet them occasionly, to learn from
them something of the university's
past life, and discuss the questions
which concern its present and
future welfare.
"The average undergraduate does
not put enough thought <m these
questions. The alumni, moreover,
would be benefited by coming in
contact with the real student life of
the university-â€”their devotion to
Pennsylvania would be strength
ened and increased, and they would
lie in a better position to aid in the
advancement of the university.
Many, indeed most, of the alumni
utterly fail to appreciate thecollege
spirit that has developed among
students during recent years, and
they can not appreciate it until
they come in contact with the stu
dents and see for themselves.
The hall in this manner would
afford ,l an excellent opportunity for
a pleasautaiwl frequent intercourse
between the alumnus and the un
dergraduate. If the alumni wotild
learn to use the hall, attend the
monthly smokers given by the club,
drop in fora few minutes after the
fall and spring games, and try in
every way (without necessarily sac
rificing much time) to come in
touch with the student life here, we
are sure that such an intercourse
between alumni and students
would be very pleasant and profit
able."
