# SECOND DEBATE.
## System of Cabinet Government Discussed Friday Evening. 
### 
The second of the Preliminaries
to choose debaters for the Intercol
legiate Debate took place in the
chapel last Friday evening. The
subject was "Granting suitable con
stitutional amendments, resolved,
That the United States should
adopt a system of responsible
cabinet government." In the ab
sence of Prof. Abbott, Prof. Lathrop
acted as chairman of the meeting.
Filcher, '91), opened the debate
with a definition of cabinet govern
ment, showing how successfully the
system has worked in other coun
tries and the practicability of its
application in our own country.
Morgan, '1)8, was the first speaker
for the negative, and he dwelt at in
length on the love of Americans for
their institutions and their antago
nistic feelings for all political ma
chinery of Great Britain, of which
the cabinet system is a part.
Whi taker, '99, followed for the
affirmative, and contended that the
question at issue should be argued
not on sentiment but on theground
of expediency, and he attempted to
show that a responscible ministry in
the United States would insure
harmony and efficiency in govern
ment.
Burehani, '97, on the negative,
attempted to show the stability and
competency of our present govern
ment as contrasted with those gov
ernments in which the responsible
ministry exists.
McKinnon, '99, in endeavoring to
show that responsible cabinet gov
ernment works successfully in this
country, cited the case of Canada,
where the system was once in
operation and was proven to be an
unqualified success.
Miss Grieb, '97, showed that the
single committee system, the minis
try, was not a success in England
owing to the fact that as the min
istry was continually overworked
important measures were neces
sarily neglected.
Considerable interest was taken
in the debate by the audience,
which, though smaller than theone
on Tuesday evening, made up in
enthusiasm what it lacked in num
bers.
