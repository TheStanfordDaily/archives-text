J. F. King, Stanford's new track
coach, left Portland Jan. 22, will
remain in Seattle four or five days,
and will arrive here about the first
of the month. Immediately after
his arrival and under his personal
direction our athletes will begin
training on track and field.
Since the opening of the semes
ter some of the men have been out
exercising in a more or less desul
tory manner, just to keep in form.
Brunton, Wilson, Morgan, McDow
ell, and Walker have practiced in
the sprints; Dole and Bovd in the
pole-vault; Hazzard, Fickert, Free
man, and Carle with the weights;
Whitaker, Polhemus, and Dole in
the jumps: Smith and Daggett in
the mile run; and Toll, Sampson,
and Adaifis in the mile walk; all
these men have been getting out
pretty regularly. Wilkinson,'94,
lias been coaching the walkers.
Carle is progressing rapidly in
putting the shot and will doubtless

make a record for himself in that
event. Fickert has not yet got
back into his old form in the shot
put or in the hammer-throw.
llazzard is progressing fairly
well in learning to throw tlie ham
mer with two turns like Edgren of
Berkeley. Manager Drown has had
a system of drains connected
with the jumping places in order
to keep them dry during the rainy
season. All the tools and athletic
paraphernalia hereafter will be
kept under lock and key in the big
box secure from rain and ill-usage.
Mr. Cross will doubtless be on
the campus in a few days, as lie is
in San Francisco at present. lie
may coach our hammer throwers
fora little while. He is enthusias
tic for Stanford and will visit here
frequently during the training sea
son.
