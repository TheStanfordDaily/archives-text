The first practice game of the
season, Saturday afternoon, brought
out a number of new players. 'I lie
day was too cold, however, for the
candidates for the pitcher's posi
tion to hhow their quality. Mur
phy had poor support and Plate
was wild; Thompson was effective
for three innings. Of the old men,
Jeffs and Thompson showed some
improvement over last year's form.
Freeman is still weak at the bat.
It. Strohn, Klauber, Cotton, and
Soper of the old second nine were
out. Claire Strohn, Beckett, and
Lougheed were the most promising
of the new men. Plate's and Maw
ley's hits were long, but would
have been captured by good out
fielders. Morgan was in an un
familiar position, and played a
poor game.
McLaine, last year's captain,
though ineligible for the team, has
consented to come out and captain
the second nine.
