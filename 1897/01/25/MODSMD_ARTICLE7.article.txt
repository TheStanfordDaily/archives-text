The Stanford lilee and Mandolin
Clubs will phiy two dates this
month for charity; one in Oakland
in the First Congregational Church
on February 29, and the other on
February 30, at the California
Theatre in San Francisco, for the
benefit of the ''Sick Babies Fund."
The latter will be under the aus-
I icas of the ICrnvniner, which first
suggested the scheme, and has
since supported it. Almost daily
the Examiner has published a pic
ture of some prominent member of
the clubs. Those that have ap
peared are Messrs Dillon and
Rilej', Kaufman, Abbott, Wells,
and Manager H. 11. Brown.
