# NO ROWING CONTEST NOW.
## Stanford Can Not Put a Boat Crew in the Field Against Berkeley. 
### 
There has been so much said and
written lately regarding the ad
visability of Stanford's trying to
meet the University of California
in a boat race, that it has been
thought advisable to make some in
vestigation into the conditions here
that seem to favor or hinder the ad
dition of this to our intercollegiate
contests. The feeling is that such
an addition is highly desirable,!
but practically impossible.
Of all the persons seen, Prof.
Show alone thought that it would
in anyway be possible fora Stan
ford crew to secure any place for
training. He said: '"1 am not sure
but, 1 think the bay could be used.
1 have several times lately ridden
on my bicycle nearly to the bay.
The Embarcadero road needs im
provement, but there is now only
about one-half to three-quarters of
a mile that can not he driven over,
that part through the willows. By
building a bridge over Wilson's,
the road to the May field slough
would lie opened and Ibis, on the
whole, 1 think would be advisable.
That would be about five miles
from the quadrangle over a road
the most of which, at least, the boys
could traverse with their bicycles."
I'rof. A. W. Smith, who rowed on
the Cornell crew for two years, was
very emphatic in his views. ''On
the Laguiiita a crew could row pos
sibly three minutes, so that is out
of tlie question. As for reaching
the bay, that is thoroughly imprac
ticable. Cooley's Landing would
be the only place at all suitable,
and that can not be reached. He
sides, on account of the Hats we
would have to watch the tides,
which would interfere with regular
training. Unless we can carry out
the scheme which l)r. Jordan was
obliged to abandon when the suit
was decided, and Hood the quad
rangle, 1 think the matter ought to
be dropped/'
Dr. Branner said: "What do I
think we ought to do? We can't
do anything about it. The current
in the channel is too strong, and on
the Hats the titles have to be
watched. The roads never could
be put in condition for the last part
of the way."
I'rof. Marx was concise: '"Why,
it's utterly impossible and out of
the question!"
Dr. Angell said: "1 am sorry it
is impossible. I walked a Univer
sity of California regent down there
last year and he emphatically and
almost prolanely admitted the ab
surdity of the proposition. I think
their committee should come down
here and look over the ground,
lied wood would be as good a place
as any, but there, although there is
a boat house and a wharf, there is
a mile or two of tortuous channel
to he traversed before the bay is
reached."'
All the professors and students
that were seen expressed great re
gret that the plan can not be car
ried through. Hut it is quite evi
dent that the obstacles in our way
are at present insurmountable.
Sometime we may have better
transportation to the water and
somewhat better facilities there,
although there would remain even

then difficulties greater than Berke
ley has to meet. At that time we
may begin to think of meeting
California on the water.
