# Coach King- Arrives.
## 
### 
John F. King, who is to have
charge of the training and coaching
of our track team this season, ar
rived at the University last even
ing, having left Portland, Oregon,
Friday night. In Portland Mr.
King held the position of physical
director of the Multnomah Athletic
Club, and gave up that position
just before he was engaged to come
to Stanford.
Coach King is a professional ath
lete of considerable ability, having
established a record of nine and
four-fifths seconds in the hundred
yard dash, and six feet three inches
in the high-jump. During his pro
fessional career as a sprinter he
covered the hundred-yard dash in
ten seconds in numerous competi
tions. Of late Mr. King has de
voted more of his attention to bi
cycle racing in the professional
ranks. He held a position as
trainer of the Omaha Athletic Club
track team, was afterwards con
nected with ttie Olympic Club of
San Francisco, and six years ago
secured his position as trainer of
the Multnomah athletes in Port
land. Taking charge of a team
composed of inexperienced men,
under his coaching there were de
veloped such athletes as Tallant,
Morgan, and Kerrigan. The club
also soon developed some of the
hest bicycle men in the Northwest.
Since Mr. King took charge of the
Multnomahs the record in the
hundred-yard dash has been re
duced from eleven seconds to ten
and two fifths.
Coach King will take charge of
the team immediately although ac
tive work will not begin until the
first of February. In the mean
time Mr. King will become ac
quainted with the team and the
material out of which the team will
be built.
