### 
Charles A. Dana, editor of the
New York Sun, delivered a lecture
before the students of the Univer
sity of Michigan recently on the
Brook Farm Colony, of which he
was a member. While at (he univer
sity lie was interviewed by a repre
sentative of the U. of M. Daily, giv
ing his opinion of university work
as training for journalism. 11 is
advice applies to other professions
than this, and coming from one in
such a high position is worthy of
much consideration, lie said:
"One of the great things which
any young man can get out of his
college course is accuracy; he can
strive for accuracy in learning and
in his class-work. If a young man
intends to do newspaper work he
will find the accuracy which will
enable him to tell just how a great
railroad accident happened, or how
a great event took place, of almost
as much value as a good education
it-elf. (icnius is undoubtedly a
factor, I>ut one who hasn't it can
acquire accuracy.
"Another great thing lie should
get in college is the ability to write
and think. His studies should aid
11iin in this of course, and as he
will undoubtedly he called on to
write and think intelligently about
a great ninny different subjects, he
will find different kinds of knowl
edge useful. Nothing that he learns
will he really useless.
'"What an intending journalist
should study depends very mater
ially upon the individual. You
can not lay down any general rules
to (it all cases. A man will follow
his natural tastes. Some people
never lead anything but novels,
and I have found that the young
man who will make a good news
paper worker is one who reads the
newspapers. Hut, there are certain
studies which are important, and
perhaps'the first of these is English
literature, that is, the literature of
the English language. With this
in importance is the English lan
guage itself; of course a thorough
knowledge of that is essential.
Then there is the study of history
and especially of American history.
The Constitution of this country
and its history ought to be studied
and a knowledge of the law will
prove very helpful. The young
journalist should inform himself
about the politics and the political
parties of his country."
