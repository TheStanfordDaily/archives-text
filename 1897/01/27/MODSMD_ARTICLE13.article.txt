A covEHiNG of cinders would
much improve the bicycle path
from Palo Alto to the University.
On such a day as this when but
light showers have been falling
there is a thin layer of mud on top
in many places which makes riding
very unpleasant. Jt is apparent
that this is due to the material of
which the path is made. \\ here
the material is porous no such dif
ficulty is found.
