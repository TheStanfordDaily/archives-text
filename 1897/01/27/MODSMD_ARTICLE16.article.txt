The proposition to tuke the Cho
ral Society to San Francisco for an
immense public recital should meet
with the hearty co-operation of all
t hose a hie to render assistance.
What the Choral Society needs is
an increase in its membership. As
the qualification for membership
consists solely in one's ability to
carry a tune, and as the benefits to
be derived from the society are very
great, there should no longer be a
dearth of material to form a strong
musical organization to carry out
the scheme proposed.

No season of the year is so
fraught with danger as this, 'i he
slow change from autumn to win
ter, the alternation of rainy days
with days of sunshine, of morning
frost with noonday heat, combine
to make it a time of great danger
unless proper care and precaution
against the change are taken. A
large number of students are at
present on the sick-list as a result
of exposure; today's sudden shower
of rain may increase the number
of victims. La grippe is in the air;
it will catch us if we don't watch
out.
