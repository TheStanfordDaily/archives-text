# Co-Education.

### 
In his annual report to the
Board of Regents of the University
of Wisconsin, President C. K. Ad
ams lias the following to say con
cerning co-education in that Uni
versity: .
"The increase of women in the
University in ten years has been
182 per cent., while the increase of
men has been 122 per cent. This
tendency simply discloses an in
creasing disposition on the part of
the young women who have com
pleted a high school course to con
tinue their studies, either for the
purpose of a broader education, or
in order to lit themselves the more
properly for the vocation of teach
ers. While many of the men are
drawn into professional studies or
business pursuits without complet
ing an undergraduate course, many
of the women are led to take such
steps as will broaden their intel
lectual horizon and enable them
to earn an honorable liveli
hood. It can not be said
that the problem of co-education
presents many difficulties. The old
query as to whether the health of
young women would bear the strain
of a university course has been
swept away bv- the energetic hand
of experience; so almost has the
doubt as to whether scholarship
would not suffer from the presence
of women in the classes. It is set
tled, not only here, but elsewhere,
that the general health of young
women is better at the time of grad
uation than at the time of entrance,
and that the average scholarship
of young women is higher than
that of young men."
