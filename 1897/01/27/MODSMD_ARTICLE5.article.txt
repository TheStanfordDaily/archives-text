# A 						PUBLIC RECITAL.
## Choral Society Planning to Give a Concert in San Francisco. 
### 
The officers of the Choral Society
have been planning for some time
to join with a similar organization
m San Francisco and give a great
public recital in the city. Prof.
Bell, a prominent musician of San
Francisco, offered last semester to
guarantee the expenses to the city
of a choral society of one hundred
and twenty-five members providing
such number could be secured.
But, lacking a sufficient member
ship, the matter was postponed un
til this semester.
Prof. Lathrop and Mr. Pasmore
of the Choral Society are at pres
ent working hard to secure a society
large enough and of sufficient abil
ity not only to justify an accept
ance of Prof. Bell's offer, but at the
same time to make a creditable
showing musically. The co-opera
tion of all those interested in this
line of work is requested.
