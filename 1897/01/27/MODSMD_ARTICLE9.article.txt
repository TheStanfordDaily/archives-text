# Modjeska at the Baldwin.
## 
### 
Mrne. Modjeska began a two
weeks' engagement in Smii Fran
cisco Monday night, after an ab
sence from the stage of several
years. The Baldwin Theatre, in
i which Modjeska played, was
! crowded, and when the actress
: made her appearance in the second
J act she was greeted with a magnifi
cent ovation that testified to the es
! teem in which she is held on this
j Coast.
The opening play was "Magda,"
Modjeska assuming the title role.
This play will be repeated every

evening this week, except Saturday
night, when "Mary Stuart" will be
presented.
