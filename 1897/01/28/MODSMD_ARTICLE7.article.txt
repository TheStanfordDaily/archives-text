Berkeley has chosen the men
who will meet us in the Carnot De
hate. Two weeks from tomorrow
night they will speak here in the
chapel against the three whom we
select to represent us. From what
is known of Berkeley's representa
tives, they compose a formidable
trio that will tax to the utmost our
efforts to win the medal this year.
They are men who have had much
experience in speaking and in pub
lic debate, and if they do not make
a hard try in this contest, none will
ever he made. We should he will
ing at least to make the contest as
interesting for them as we can, and
should give to the men who repre
sent us every possible bit of en
couragement and support. Indi
vidual interest will grow into com
bined enthusiasm if we go at it in
the right way, and that is what we
want now.
