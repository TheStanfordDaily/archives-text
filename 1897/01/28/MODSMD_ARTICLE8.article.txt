The bill in the Legislature ex
empting Stanford University and
the Academy of Sciences from tax
iition has been favorably reported
to the Assembly by the Judiciary
Committee of that body. The bill
as it now stands is slightly changed
from the original, several objections
of a legal nature having been made
by members of both ihe Senate and
the Assembly. Very little opposi
tion was encountered when the hill
was before either of the committees,
but it will hardly fa re so well when
it is brought up for passage.
The members of Butte and Yolo,

where there are large Stanford in
terests, will oppose the bill because
they are not willing that the coun
ties which they represent should be
deprived of the large amount that
they now realize as taxes on Stan
ford property. This amounts to
something like $25,000 a year.
Assemblyman Malcolm was on
the campus this morning and
stated that he thought these claims
could be compromised in a manner
that would put the bill in a fail
way to be passed without much op
position. It is possible that a new
bill, re-apportioning the taxes of
the state so that Butte and Yolo
counties would not suffer, may be
introduced and passed.
One of the pleasantest features
of the contest, Mr. Mulcom said,
was the support which the bill is
receiving from University of Cali
fornia men. There are several
Berkeley graduates in the Legisla
ture and they are united in favor
ing the bill.
