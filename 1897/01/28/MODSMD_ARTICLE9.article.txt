ing the last week much interest has
been shown in baseball. Candi
dates for class teams are coming to
gether for organization, and the
practicing goes on quite regularly
for the inter-class games which are
to be played next week. As '99
has much the same material as
that with which the class won last
season,its chances are undoubtedly
good. The season is to be opened
Saturday by a game between the
glee club and football nines. The
game has been well advertised.
Elaborate score-cards have been
printed, and there is little doubt
that it will prove a success in
every respect.
Although baseball has attracted
much interest from the student
body, debating has not been for
gotten. The first preliminary for
the Carnot Medal took place last
Friday evening. An unusually
large number entered, several stu
dents of the Law College crossing
the bay to participate. Seven
candidates were chosen to debate
again at the second preliminary
which takes place tomorrow
evening.
The track athletes held an en
thusiastic meeting Friday after
noon. Professor Edwards addressed
the meeting, and Captain Everett
Brown then outlined the season's
work. As a result thirty or forty
men have indulged in tin*, cross
country runs which are held period
ically. On the last run the men
traveled easily, covering in all only
five or six miles.
The library has recently re
ceived extensive additions in the
Semitic, English, and German de
partments. Alfred Greenebaum
has presented the University with
a library of Semitic literature, ac
companied by a check for its
increase and maintenance. It con
sists of 672 manuscripts and
nearly 1,000 volumes.
A university cotillion somewhat
similar to the one given last term
will be given in Harmon gym
nasium next month by a number
of the students. Thy leading men
on the committee are F. S. Knight,
(). T. Wedemeyer, and C. R. Morse.
The chess players of the uni
versity have during the last week
formed a chess club. Considerable
interest has been awakened and it
is hoped that in time arrangements
may be made for intercollegiate
contests such as are held among
the Eastern colleges.
The Athletic Association has re
cently made several changes in its
constitution in relation to the office
of track manager. The nomination
for football manager, which should
have taken place on January 19,
has been postponed until February
4, the election to occur February 9.
The election for next year's football
captain, though not definite]}'
settled, will probably take place on
January 30. Berkeley an.
