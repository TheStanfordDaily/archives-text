Tonight, a few moments after
this paper appears from the press,
the decision of the judges of the
Preliminary Debates will be an
nounced, and it will be known who
is to represent Stanford in the In
tercollegiate Debate. Whatever that
decision may be, we may rest as
sured that there will be no dissent
ing opinion heard. All who have
entered the contest have done so for
the sake of furthering our debating
interests and no one will be disap
pointed if the team sent against
Berkeley is made up of other de
baters and he has been left* out.
The desire of all is that the strong
est possible team be put in the
Held. It was to choose such a team
that judges were selected from dif
ferent departments of the Univer
sity, so that the composite opinion
of them all would be as perfect as
human judgment can be. Of course
it is entirely out of the question for
more'than the smallest fraction of
the good debaters of the University
to make the team. It will be no
reflection on the debating abilities
of the sixteen persons in these Pre
liminaries who fail to secure places
on ihe team. It has been generally
remarked that the debating this
year has been unusually good all
around. To these persons, who
have made the selection of a strong
team possible, the Daily Palo Alto
extends congratulations. You ha ve
been an honor to the debating in
terests of Stanford and to your
selves. We hope that next year
you will all try again.
