# New Football Rules.
## 
### 
Authorities throughout the coun
try have begun the discussion of
changing the football rules for next
year. Although in general this
year's rules have been very satis
factory, there seems to have arisen
a vagueness as to the application of
certain rules.
One of the first things that may
he acted upon is the abolition of
the back guards' interference. It
was supposed that mass plays had
been abolished, but hist fall nearly
nil the colleges were able to use dif
ferent forms of this back guards' in
terference by a very line interpreta
tion of the rules. The general sug
gestion for the abolition of this
play seems to do away with all for
mations back of the line, and to
compel the men in line to remain
in position until the ball is put in
play.
Another point that may he con
sidered in the revision of the rules
for next year is the idea of allowing
the quarter-back to run with the
ball. Thus the quarter-back would
be allowed the same privileges as
the half-backs and the full-hack.
For the last three years the quarter
back has been allowed to puni
whenever he pleased, but he has
not had the right to run with the
ball until it has been touched by a
third man. There seems to be
some reason why the quarter-back
should be permitted to run with
the ball as do the backs. If such
a play were allowed it would open
up an entirely new system of team
play, and would introduce many
new scientific plays. —Cornell Sun.
