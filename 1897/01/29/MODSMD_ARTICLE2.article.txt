The Banjo Club was organized a

one of the most promising of our
musical organizations. Careful and
conscientious practice has made the
club one well worthy of public fa

series of concerts, the first of which
will be given in the chapel on the
evening of February 27. Follow

Alameda March 4.
The club has been at considera
ble expense in equipping the mem

clasp music. A splendid set of new
banjos has lately been received

according to a special order of the

members of the clul> are well satis

In the concert to he given in the
chapel the cluh will prohahly be as
