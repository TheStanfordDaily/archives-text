The Choral Society rehearsal last
evening was well attended in spite
of the weather. The semester's
work, consisting of selections from
''Elijah" and the "Messiah,' 1 was
run over in a sketchy sort of way,
in preparation for the more careful
work to follow. As only ten re
hearsals remain before the initia.l
concert in San Francisco, very rapid
work will have to be done, and reg
ular attendance is imperative. At
this concert the Chorus will have
i he assistance of ast ring orchestra,
and possibly of a full orchestra.
On account of the short time for
preparation, the membership will
lie closed at the next rehearsal, ex
cept to those who can come up to a
certain standard in reading music.
This test will not be applied next
Thursday, so that everyone may
have a chance to join at that time.
About forty more voices are needed,
mostly soprano and alto. This will
make the Chorus complete. Voices
will be tried next Thursday even
ing at the chapel at 7 oclock.
