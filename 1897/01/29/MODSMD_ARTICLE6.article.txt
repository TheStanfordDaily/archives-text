### 
The Executive Committee of the
student body met last evening to
transact business. Pomeroy, Hin
dry, NVardall, Pratt, Fisher, and
Leiter were present.
The committee decided to grant
Baseball Manager James permis
sion to charge admission to the in
ter-class baseball games, and in
structed Treasurer Morrison to ap
ply the proceeds to defraying the
expenses of Coach Lange. The
proceeds of last year's inter-class
games were $47.40, and so this ac
tion of the committee is really an
appropriation of $50 fora baseball
coach.
The recommendation of the Ath
letic Committee that an appropria
tion be made for lacrosse sticks was
not acted upon favorably.
The Banjo Club was given per
mission to give a concert on the
campus and one in Alameda.
The sub-committee appointed to
audit Treasurer Morrison's ac
counts for last semester made a
partial report, showing that the
treasurer's accounts were in every
way satisfactory. The full report
will be published later. The treas
urer's report for December, delayed
on account of his recent illness, was
accepted. The committee then ad
journed.
