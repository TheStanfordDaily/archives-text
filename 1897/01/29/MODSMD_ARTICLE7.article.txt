# Chapel Preacher.
## 
### 
The liev. Dr. Minton, who
preaches in the chapel next Sunday,
is not a stranger to the University;
in fact he may be called one of the
regular University preachers. Dr.
Minton is dean of the San Fran
cisco Theological Seminary located
at San Anselmo, and was also until
recently pastor of the Westminster
Presbyterian Church in San Fran
cisco. Several Stanford graduates
are now studying at San Anselmo.
Dr. Minton is a vigorous writer as
well as preacher, and is accounted
one of the ablest men in hiscluirch.
While at the University he will be
the guest of Professor Miller.
