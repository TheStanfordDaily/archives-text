Three students of the University

Chicago University is likely to
be severely criticised for the at
tempt that its football men are
making to replete the varsity team.
It is said that three of the Carlisle
Indian players will be in the uni
versity next season, for football of
course. Also a number of old play
ers, some of them college graduates,
will be used in making up this ag
gregation with which Chicago in
tends to capture the American
championship.
The new game of pushball is
looked upon as likely to be a for
midable rival of football. A num
ber of universities and athletic
associations have taken it up and
tested it, with the prediction that
though it may take time to intro
duce the game, it may become very
popular.
Fraternities at the University of
Cincinnati have had a disagree
ment over the time limit within
which new men may be pledged.
They tried to draw up an agree
ment prohibiting summer pledges
and ''rushing" before a, man had
entered his classes. This failed,
and now the fraternities are at war
among themselves.
