The status of the agreement re
garding intercollegiate debating be
tween Stanford and Berkeley does
not seem to be very clearly under
stood. The old agreement expired
last year and new arrangements
have yet to be made to cover the
debate of this year. The matter of
agreements is left to a committee
of six composed of three representa
tives from each university and
known as the executive committee
of the Intercollegiate Debating
League. This committee should
not be confounded with the execu
tive committee of the Inter-Society
Debating League, which is a com
mittee composed of three represen
tatives from each of the live debat
ing societies of this University.
Berkeley's three members of the
intercollegiate committee this year
have not been selected, but they
will probably be chosen this week.
A meeting of the joint committee
should then be held at once so that
the debaters may know as soon as
possible what arrangements are to
be made for this year's debate.
