# Student Honor.
## 
### 
The honor system of conducting
examinations originated at Prince
ton University. It was an imme
diate and permanent success, as the
following from a recent issue of the
Princetonian will show:
'"Several years ago the Princeton
undergraduates, assembled in mass
meeting, decided to place the col
lege exiiminationson a much higher
plane than that on which they had
formerly rested, and to this end
they declared that henceforth every
undergraduate should he put upon
his honor and at the close of each
examination should pledge his
honor as a gentleman that he had
neither given nor received assist
ance of any sort. Furthermore, :t
was declared to he the duty of
every student who should he the
witness of any cheating to report
ihe same to the undergraduate com
mittee. This committee was com
missioned to act upon such cases
presented to it.and report their ac
tion to the faculty for contirma
'"The system has been given a
thorough trial and has not been
found wanting. We wish all new
men to understand that this is tiie
position Princeton has taken on
this important matter; that the
rules laid down for conducting ex
aminations are fully in force and
are backed by the united senti
ment of the undergraduate body.
The position of Princeton is the
same today as it was when this
step was taken, and in no respect
do we propose to retreat from the
stand taken then. Sometimes there
have been one or two men whose
sense of honor has been so low that
they have cheated. Though no
one is in the least expected to act
as a spy or monitor over his fellow
students, yet if any case should
come to his notice it is his duty,
without any personal consideration
whatsoever, to report the matter to
ihe student committee."
