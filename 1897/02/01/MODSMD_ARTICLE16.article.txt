# THE 						PALO ALTO.
## 
### 

Closely associated with Stanford University is the Palo Alto (or high
tree), healed at the edge of the Stanford estate, where the Southern
Pacific Railroad crosses the San Kraneisquito Creek. This is the only
redwood tree left standing in the valley. It was from it that the town
connected with Stanford University was named, and it was thus that
the name Palo Alto became known throughout the educational world.
