# Chapel Sermon.

### 
Sunday's sermon in the chapel
was by Bev. Henry C. Minton,
I). 1)., of the Pacific Theological
Seminary, San Anselmo. The text
was from John xvii,4: "I have glo
rified Thee on the earth, I have fin
ished the work which Thou gavest
me to do."
The text is a retrospect of a well
spent life. There is no hint in it
of gloom or of complaint, no regret
for the life that is past. These
words give us the true elements
that belong to every Christian life.
Our life should be like Hisâ€”a life
of activity, of service, of usefulness,
and of love.
The first, element is that of glo
rifying God. Everything we have
is from Ilis bounty; every instru
ment, every means we use is from
Him. The creatures are created to
do the Creator's will. How are we
to do this? We can have at most
a very incomplete and imperfect
conception of what God's glory is;
it is too great and grand a thought
for us. But the glory of God is set
forth as the highest good of the best
and wisest of His creatures. We
find the glory of the Lord ever
identifying itself with Ilis people.
On every page of His blessed Book
he invites everyone to come to
Him, so that He ever links llis high
est glory with our highest good. God
wills that men should be saved.
We glorify God when we do our
best, when we honor our con
sciences, when we reach our holi
est possible development, and when
we magnify every opportunity,
squandering nothing. The. flowers
glorify Him with their sweetness,
the mountain with its massive
beauty, trees with their fragrnneeof
today and their golden fruit of to
morrow, the stars in the heavens by
their shining. God made them to
be stars, and they glorify Him in
that. Man is to do what God made
him to do, then God's glory will be
achieved.
The second thought is that of
finishing the work given us to do.
This is only a part of the other. A
man's work is worthy of himself
only when it is God's work. ''My
work is the work of Him that sent
me." Every successful human life
bases its success upon the idea that
the work for it to do is not its own
but the work of llim that gave life
No man lives who has not his own
appropriate, personal work to do;
if he leaves it undone, God will
leave His part undone also.
We need first of all to realize
what our work is, and that we are
doing it, the simple consciousness
that we are pegging away at the
work God has for us to do. One
always feels an intense sympathy
for a man who is doing the wrong
work; for it is hard to glorify God
and do His work with a life-long
misfit. Our religion must conde
scend to pervade the atmosphere of
our daily life. Then let life bring
its vicissitudes of joy and sorrow,

let men criticise or praise, bear or
forbear, let evil report or good report
go forth, we are doing God's work,
we can humbly claim his own ser
vice, we are not our own but His.
There is, however, a pathos in the
words of the text; thirty-three years
round up a very short life. Yet
what matters it when the summons
comes if our work is well done?
Death never conies too early to the
man that is doing God's work. On
the other hand, the saddest sight
one can see on earth is a life that is
a failure; death is sad if it breaks
in upon our unfinished work. If
we do God's work, then whether the
end comes late in life or on the very
threshold of life's maturer years, or
in the dew of youth, we can say
with the Master: 1 have finished
the work Thou gavest me to do.
