# Association of Collegiate Alumnae.

### 
Among the organizations for the
advancement of education in this
country the Association of Intercol
legiate Alumnae occupies a promi
nent position. Through the cour
tesy of Mrs. Mary R. Smith of the
department of Sociology, who is
treasurer of the association and
president of the California branch,
we are enabled to give a brief ac
count of its objects, work, and his
tory.
It was organized in 1881 in Bos
ton. At that time membership was
limited to the following twelve in
stitutions: The Universities of Bos
ton, Cornell, Kansas, Michigan,
Wisconsin, Syracuse, and Wes
leyan, and Wellesley, Smith, Yas
sar, and Oberliti Colleges, and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy. Subsequently Bryn Mawr
College and University of Califor
nia were added to this number.
During the past seven years no
other institutions have been admit
ted to membership, but at the last
annual meeting a committee was
appointed to consider the qualifica
tions of various other institutions
of first rank. There is but little
doubt that Stanford and Chicago
will be admitted. They have been
excluded from membership because
of their recent foundation and the
small number of their alumna?.
The membership of the associa
tion now numbers 1,955. Of this
number, 172 have taken master's
degrees, and 41 the degree of Ph.D.
Among the most eminent mem
bers now living are Miss Marion
Talbot, dean of the woman's depart
ment of Chicago University; Pro
fessor Lucy Salmon, Yassar; Pro
fessor Katherine Cannon, Wellesley;
Mrs. Alice Freeman Palmer, for
merly president of Wellesley; and
Professor Emma Perkins, Western
Reserve. Miss Wiekham, Mrs. Mil
ler, Miss Hoi brook, Mrs. Elliott,
Mrs. Branner, Mrs. Marx, Mrs.
Barnes, and Mrs. Smith of Stan
ford are members.
Meetings are held annually, one
year in the West and the following
in the East, at the invitation of the
local branches. That of last year
met in Providence, R. 1., in the
buildings of Brown University.
Mrs. Smith was present as delegate
from the California branch.
In all, there are twenty-two
branches, located in all the prin
cipal cities of the Union. The
Pacific Coast has two, one at Los

Angeles and the other in San Fran
cisco. Local branches may lie or
ganized wherever a sufficient num
ber of members can be found.
Broadly speaking, the object of
the association is the promotion of
higher education among women.
It maintained a fellowship for ad
vanced study in Europe, and an
other for study in any American
university. What is being done in
other directions to the same end is
indicated by the following abstract
of the fifteenth annual meeting:
"The Detroit and Rhode Island
branches have been at work in the
interests of the University of Mich
igan and of Brown University.
Rhode Island has collected $1,000
for the benefit of the Woman's Col
lege in connection with Brown
University. . . . Detroit has
added to the fund for the gymnas
ium for women at Ann Arbor until
the amount which stood in 18 ( J5 at
$670 has now reached $41,980.
Minnesota and Ohio have kept in
touch with college work by means
of papers and discussions on such
subjects iis 'College athletics,' and
'Advantages of college training to
society women.' "
But the activities of the asso
ciation are by no means confined
to education. Through some of
the local branches investigations
concerning wages paid to women
have been carried on. A report of
these investigations was recently
published by the State of Massa
chusetts. A bibliography of higher
education for women has also been
prepared by the association and
will shortly be published by the
Boston Public Library. Much is
done also in the collection and dis
semination of information of differ
ent kinds, watching local legisla
tion, and introducing sanitary ie
forrn in the public schools. The
constant endeavor of the associa
tion has been to take up needful
work that would otherwise remain
undone, and it encroaches upon
the field of no other organization.
