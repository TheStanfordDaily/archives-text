Complaint has been made to us
of the manner in which the Sequoia
is being conducted. Certain persons
regret "that it is not the paper that
it used to be, that it is merely 'an
annex to the English department,'
that it does not properly represent
the University, that it publishes
too much from outside contributors
and too little from our own student
writers, and that it is totally lack
ing in those qualities which should
distinguish a college journal.''
With complaints of this nature we
have nothing to do. Communica
tions concerning the management of
the Sequoia should be addressed to
the editor of that paper, not to us.
So, whether we agree or disagree
with what is said of the Sequoia,
we are not willing to assume a
critical attitude toward our contem
porary and its business.
