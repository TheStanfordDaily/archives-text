The matter that is just now ngi
tating football circles is the selec
tion of a coach for the coming
year. The problem is a somewhat
difficult one to solve. There are
two men, both sons of mother Yale,
who are highly esteemed by the
students of Standford and loved by
the football fraternity. Both have
won for themselves the lasting
gratitude and admiration of all
who have come in contact with

them, and it is a misfortune not to
be able to have both, but as this
can not be clone the greatest care
should be taken by the manage
ment in inviting a coach. The stu
dents have confidence, however, in
the ability of the management to
make such arrangements as shall
procure for us a good coach, and at
the same time not slight any of the
friends of Stanford. The kindest
disposition of those whom we have
honored and have been honored
by is always solicited by us.
