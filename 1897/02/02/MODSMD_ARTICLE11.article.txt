The proposition which comes be
fore the Executive Committee to
morrow evening, relating to the
matter of providing better means
and facilities to the intercollegiate
debaters in their preparation, is a
worthy object of attention. If the
committee by a small appropriation
can in any way increase our
chances in the Intercollegiate De
bate this year, without endangering
our financial condition to any con
siderable extent, favorable action
should be taken. Any action should
be immediate and final in order to
obtain the best results. A full
meeting of the committee should
give the matter careful considera
tion.
