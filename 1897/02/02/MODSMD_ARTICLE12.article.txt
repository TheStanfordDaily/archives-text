On the third page of this issue
we print a clipping from the Occi
dent, which makes an attempt to
explain Berkeley's defeat in foot
hall. It is said that "some lay it
to the door, or rather to the hypo
thetical door of the long-dreamed-of
dormitories." The lack of dormi
tories at Berkeley is doubtless a
very potent factor in California's
defeat, and for the sake of a
stronger rivalry between the two
universities, if for nothing else, we
hope that the "long-dreamed-of
dormitories" may ere long rise on
our sister university's campus.
Those who have lived both in the
dormitory and outside here at
Stanford realize that Encina does
much to foster our college spirit.
To such persons the constant How
of students from the Hall is a
source of sincere regret. The per
petuation of a valuable feature of
our university life depends upon
the successful operation of Encina
Hall. The present trouble should
be ascertained and, if possible,
remedied.
