Since the bill designed to make
prize-fights possible in Nevada
passed the Nevada State Legisla
ture and was signed by the gov
ernor, the legislators and the gov
ernor have given as a justification
of their action the lame excuse that
pugilistic contests were no more
brutal than football games, which
were permitted by law. A more
manly course would have been to
acknowledge openly the true motive
of their action, their desire to profit
by the influx of visitors and money
which would accompany the pro
posed contest. Probably, however,
the legislators of Nevada are in
earnest in believing football to be a
brutal game, basing their belief on
the exhibitions of the virtually pro
fessional teams of the Rocky Moun
tain region. But to compare a foot
ball game between college teams,
composed of well-trained men strug
gling on the gridiron for love of
alma mater, in which injuries rare
ly occur, to a prize-fight between
men the deliberate purpose and in
tent of each of whom is to injure
and maim his opponent in such a
way as to win the prize money â€”
that is the height of absurdity.
