The way in which many of the
examinations are conducted could
be improved upon without very
much effort. In many of the classes
the questions are written on the
blackboards, and are incapable of
being read either on account of
the handwriting or the reflection
of light on the boards. Conse
quently the questions have to be
read and re-read, which is a source
of great annoyance to those being
examined. Futhermore, the ques
tions are often not stated in a clear
manner, which necessitates addi
tional explanations, if any expla
nations are necessary they should be
made at the beginning of the hour,
and after this the student should
be allowed to give his undivided at
tention to the subject at hand.
Syllabus fees are paid in so many
courses that the questions could be
typewritten and then be distrib
uted. This method is now pursued
in many of the classes and a fur
ther development along this line
would be much appreciated, and
would obviate these difficulties of
the other system.
