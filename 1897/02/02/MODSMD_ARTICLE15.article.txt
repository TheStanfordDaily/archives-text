# THE
						WHY OF IT.
## What Berkeley People Think Concerning Stanford Supremacy. 
### 
innumerable reasons have always
been advanced to explain our tie
feats in football. Some lay it to
the door, or rather to the hypothet
ical door of the long-dreamed-of
dormitories; others to our coaches,
or our captain, or our grounds, or
our bad luck, or cardinal superior
ity in all things, and one of our
professors, an enthusiastic and
staunch supporter of athletics,
ascribed one of our defeats to eat
ing bananas! Everybody —senior,
junior, soph, freshv, prof, in
structor, co ed, janitor, member of
the police---has offered some rigor
ously-concatenated explanation of
ihe phenomenon, and many are en
gaged in deep schemes which are to
neutralize the evil agent, whatever
it may be, and give us an enrap
tured gaze at long-beseeched vic
tory. Dictatorships, executive com
mittees, etc., etc., are proposed, and
the student body nonchalently
awaits the magic word which will
burl Stanford in the gloomy caves
of defeat.
But something more tangible is
needed. All the executive commit
tees, all the dictatorships in the
world will do nothing, absolutely
nothing, unless men will come out
and play football. All our de
feats, and especially the lust one,
can be directly traced back to this
cause: the total lack of strong, will
ing, numerous material to work
upon. It is lamentable to see the
number of strong, able-bodied men
sitting on the benches, passively,
criticising, growling, acting only as
an immense drag to the efforts of
others. It is deplorable to think
that out of a student body of 1500,
only about thirty men are willing
to devote themselves to their ahno
mater. This, and this only, is the
cause of our defeats. Stanford has
no dictators, no executive commit
tees, and yet —
No; it will only be when the men
of California, all the able-bodied
men adapted to football, put on the
canvas armor and go forth in the
liehl with determination, that we
can hope; only when the drag of a
critical, skeptical, jeering student
body will be transformed to a thrill
ing, enthusiastic, active throng,
that we may look forward with con
fidence. Then and then only, will
the cardinal vanish from the sky,
and on old North Hall, trembling
with delight, will long-exiled \ ic
tory perch.— Occident.
