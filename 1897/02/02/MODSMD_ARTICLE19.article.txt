# CATHOLIC THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY.
## 
### 

Ahout one and a half miles from the University, near Menlo Park,
there is heing huilt the largest seminary for the education of priests
to be found in the United States west of Cincinnati. This institu
tion was established in this vicinity largely through the influence
of Senator Stanford, who gave the seminary a perpetual right to all the
water necessary for its use and allowed the stones for the foundations of
the buildings to be taken from his quarry free.
