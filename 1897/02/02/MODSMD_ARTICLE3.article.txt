Editor of the Daily Palo Alto.
Dear Sir: In regard to the criti
cisms that have been made of the
Sequoia I should like to say that if
the paper is "merely an annex of
the English department'' it is only
so because thus far that is the only
department that has responded to
our request for material. I take it
that the Sequoia should be pri
marily a literary magazine, and as
such we have tried to conduct it.
We have the Daily Palo Alto for
news and Josh for vulgarity.
Jn previous years much of the
space in the magazine was devoted
to editorials and athletics. This
year we have dispensed with the
former, believing that those of the
daily paper are sufficient for all
purposes, and the latter we have re
stricted to one page. The space
thus gained we have devoted to
some of the best things that we
have been able to cull from the by
ways of literature. We published
the only authorized American re
print of Andrew Lang's Auccassin
and Nicolete, for which Professor
Matzke wrote a valuable introduc
tion. Professors Barnes a nd Lathrop
have also written valuable and in
teresting introductions to stories by
Kenneth Grahame, and H. B. Mar
riot Watson, and Miss Emma
Francis Dawson, the author of An
Itinerant House, has just promised
to write us an original prose poem
similar to h<;r Jn Silver Upon Pur
ple.
There has never been any stu
dent contribution refused on ac
count of lack of space. But not all
the student material that we receive
is worthy of publication, and such
material we do not propose to pub
lish. This year we have published
the best stories of college life ever
written at Stanford â€”those by Dane
Coolidge and Chas. K. Field.
We had hoped to be able to pub
lish an alumni department this
year, but the limited number of
subscribers among the graduates
did not warrant us in doing so.
This year the Sequoia has met
with the unqualified commenda
tion of almost the entire faculty,
and of the more prominent mem

bers of the student body. Among
the former J may mention Pro
fessors Abbott, Miller, Barnes, Robs,
(iriggs, Howard, Stillman, Ander
son, Newcomer, and others. Abroad
the paper has created most favora
ble comment, as may be seen from
the following quotations:
"mahi.oks road,
"KENSINGTON, W\, LONDON,
"October 12, 1896.
"... The paper is extremely
well printed, and is in many re
spects superior to similar publica
tions in this country.
''Sincerely, Andrew Lang."
"69 CORN HILL, BOSTON, MASS.,
"December 18, 1896.
"... We wish to state as
well that we have had much pleas
ure in reading the review you
printed on Francis Thompson, a
copy of which was sent to him. It
is by far the most accurate and just
estimate of the man and poet which
has yet appeared in the country.
"Yours very truly,
"COPELAND AND I)AY."
The Sequoia has been placed
upon the editorial list of a larger
number of the best publishing
houses in the country than any
other college magazine in America.
In addition to this it h;is a larger
circulation than ever before, which
fact, I think, is a sufficient proof of
its popularity, despite the com
plaints of a few anonymous dis
gruntiers, who probably do not help
the magazine, either by subscrip
tions or contributions.
