# OBJECT TO FOOTBALL.
## Attempts Being Made by the State Legislatures to Stop the Sport. 
### 
Hills have recently been intro
duced in several of the state legis
latures making it a misdemeanor
to play football in those states. Al
though the proposed legislation ap
pears absurd and is being severely
criticised throughout the states in
question, those introducing the
lulls are confident that they will be
passed. These bills, if passed, will
place football on the same level as
prize-lighting and will characterize
the game as brutal in the extreme.
In justification of the sport much
is to he said. ''In twenty years,"
says Caspar Whitney, ''there have
been so far as I have authentically
traced, six deaths due to football.
Everyone of these fatal injuries has
been received in a game between
teams composed of immature [flay
ers, or between teams at colleges or
schools where football was of very
recent introduction."
Undoubtedly the hardest games
in the country have been those
played by the Eastern college
teams, Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
and Pennsylvania; yet in all the
games between those universities
there has never been a death as the
result of football, and permanent
injuries have been rare.
Our California games have never
been marred by injuries of any
consequence, the men usually being
in better condition a few days after
a game than before.
The legislators in Missouri and
Georgia, before taking definite ac
tion on the bills before them, should
consider the many beneficial fea
tures connected with football. They
should remember that it is a game
which presidents and professors of
nearly every college in America
have pronounced a sport that not
only develops self-restraint and
self-reliance but cultivates will and
courage more perfectly than any
other game. They should remem
ber that it is a game which, besides
building up the body as no other
game can, cultivates all the manly
qualities that students in college
should possess.
It is not to be expected that any
game that is vigorous and requires
careful preparation, can be played
with absolute safety by men who
have not made a serious business of
getting ready for it. In the raw or
distorted form in which legislators
may have seen football, it is hound
to impress spectators most unfavor
ably. No one should be surprised,
therefore, that the game, which be
comes more and more popular each
year, which means more and more
games between elevens not well pre
pared, draws criticism even in such
violent form as the introduction
of bills to restrain or forbid the
game. Hut those who appreciate
the value of the game need not fear
for the sport. Only when it is un
derstood can it he appreciated.
