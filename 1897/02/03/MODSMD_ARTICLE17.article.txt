The necessity for work on the
part of our contestants for the Car
not Medal may be seen by the fol
lowing clipping from yesterday's
San Francisco Chronicle: "Professor
Gayley is now training those who
are to uphold the blue and gold in
the Carnot Debate this year and he
hopes that the medal may again be
captured by a Berkeley man. Last
year M. C. Flaherty, who is now
a University Fellow in argumenta
tion, won the medal offered
by Carnot and as the blue
and gold has possession of the
intercollegiate debating cup, it
seems that in debating and not in
athletics the State University troub
les Stanford. To uphold this rep
utation for success in the forum is
what the representatives of Califor
nia are striving to do." This em
phasizes, too, in some degree, theat

titude which outsiders are begin
ning to take regarding our forensic
abilities.
