The exceedingly large number of
students who have been compelled
to seek treatment for their eyes
seems to indicate that our lighting
system is faulty. Students study
late in the afternoon in the half
lighted library, thus putting their
eyes to a most severe strain. If the
lights could be turned on a little
earlier in the evening, or if students
could yo arrange their work as not
to be compelled to study during the
twilight hours, this difficulty
might be removed.
There is, however, another danger
which is of much more vital im
portance. Oculists have found in
examining the eyes of many of our
number, that in a majority of cases
the visual weakness is directly
traceable to the glaring brilliancy
of our electric lights. The clear
glass globes that are in use here are
not suited to the close work which
students have to do; the glass is so
highly polished and so clear that
the light is positively ruinous to
the eyes. We suggest the substitu
tion of ground-glass globes for those
now in use. It should not be dif
ficult to do this. The benefits that
would result from the change can
not be overestimated, while it would
save the hard-working students an
immense amount of trouble, worry,
and inconvenience.
