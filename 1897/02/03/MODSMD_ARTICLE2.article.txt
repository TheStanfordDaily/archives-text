versity of California Boating Asso
ciation is reported to have said the
following concerning Stanford's in
ability to row:
"The Stanford captain says his
collegians are very anxious to row,
but if so thev have not shown it so

far. We have gone to great trouble
to lie prepared to meet them. For
two years we hired a coach for that
purpose. After waiting patiently

that they should take some step in
the matter. We do not ask fora

the}'set some definite date, '1)8 or
'91), or whatever it may he, when
they will meet us on the water."
