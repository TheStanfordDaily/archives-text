# ADVICE TO DEBATERS.
## Dr. Ross Criticizes Those Who Took Part in the Preliminaries. 
### 
Professor Ross met the debaters
who appeared in the Preliminary
I)ebates, in his oflice yesterday after
noon, and gave them some valuable
criticism in an informal way. He
said that the debate was character
ized by the power which the speak
ers had to think. They evidently
knew how to prepare and how to
find their material. The majority,
however, showed lack of training,
not of practice in thinking, hut in
the use of the hand and of the
voice. The proper use of these can
only be brought about by training
and criticism, which we have so
far been unable to give. The ma
jority of the speakers are more con
vincing than persuasive. To be
persuasive one must impress his
personality upon his hearers, but
few of the contestants had this per
suasive ability.
There are three essential points
to be remembered in debating:
first, use your natural voice; second,
make your voice flexible, give it a
wide range, do not pay any atten
tion to cadence, but make the em
phasis suit your thoughts; and
I third, select three or four impor
-1 tant points and make them strong
I and striking, instead of spreading
over too large a field.
