Editor Daily Palo Alto: I read
with much interest the defense of
his journal by the editor of the Se
quoia. 1 have long felt that there
should he some public remon
strance against his manner of con
ducting that paper, and his commu
nication has given me an opportu
nity to express what 1 believe to be
the sentiment of almost the entire
student body and of a large portion
of the alumni.
A college magazine, I take it, oc
cupies a unique place in literature.
It should exist mainly as a reflec
tion of the college life and as an ex
pression of undergraduate thought.
As such it does not generally hold
a high literary plane. 1 do not be
lieve that there is a single Ameri
can college weekly, from the Har
vard Advocate down to the average
normal school production, which is
worth the money paid for it to any
one outside the college in which it
is published When I take up my
own college weekly I do not regard
it critically from a high literary
standpoint. 1 read it first because
it embraces the work of men and
women with whom 1 am associated
and in whose progress I have an in
terest; and then I am interested in
it because it reflects the college life.
Does the Sequoia fulfill these func
tions? J think not.
Five numbers of last semester's
Sequoia contained only one article
each by undergraduates in Stan
ford. This is exclusive of the de
partment of book reviews, of which
I will treat later. A large part of
the matter written by undergradu
ates is reprinted from recent Annu
als, and is therefore already fami
lair to us all. The editor has filled
the magazine from cover to cover
with articles by outside authors,
and articles which are reprints at
that; with reviews of a few obscure

publications, most of which have
lit) great interest for the University
at large; and with :i few stray con
tributions culhd from a half dozen
writers at present in Stanford. -
Mr. Hulme's complaint concern
ing the low character of student
conirihutions is quite touching in
view of the fact that for four years
students tilled the Sequoia's col
umns very acceptablyâ€”at least to
the great body of our students.
However, it does not appear that
outside contributions have been
used this year solely to supply the
deficit of local manuscript, but
rather, that the latter has been
used to till up when sufficient of the
former was not to he had. The en
thusiastic approval of the majority
of the students which Mr. liulme
claims is wholly imaginative or
the writer is much mistaken. 1
have found very few who do not
criticise the present Sequoia very
seriously.
What reason have I for support
ing a college paper which princi
pally doles out the already pub
lished work of a few literary de
cadents whom the editor is reward
ing for their patronage? 1 make an
exception of Stevenson's story, but
1 can get for five cents a copy of
the Ittbelot containing that story in
full. "Auccassin and Nicolete,"
"The Quandry of the Bishop," etc.,
are also accessible in editions of
moderate cost. Moreover, almost
all these features, while appealing
to the specialist in English, have
no interest for the student body at
large.
The increased circulation of the
paper may be accounted for partly
by the immense size of the free list
this year. For example, a copy is
regularly sent to every high school
on the Coast. There is a great dif
ference between free and paid sub
scriptions.
As for the complimentary no
tices, a few minutes' thought should
convince the editor that features
which appeal to Mr. Langand Miss
Watson may not appeal to our stu
dents, and anyone with a sense of
humor can see the damnation in
Lang's faint praise. Philistine.
