# GOOD FINANCIERING.
## Auditing Committee Finds Our Debt Very Materially Reduced. 
### 
The Executive Committee of the
student body held its monthly
meeting last evening, with a full at
tendance. Treasurer Morrison's re
port for January was accepted.
None of the intercollegiate debaters
were present, so the matterof grant
ing them an appropriation was
postponed.
The report of the auditing com
mittee, appointed to audit the ac
counts of Treasurer F. W. Morrison
for last semester, was read and
adopted as follows:
The committee gave Treasurer
.Morrison's books a thorough exam
ination, and found his books kept
in a very careful and business-like
manner. Itemized vouchers were
f.iund for every expense. The
treasurer has in his possession state
ments from the managers of thea
ters, teams, etc., with whom he has
had to deal, as to the amount of
money received in the various con
certs, games, etc. Thus the student
body is protected both as to receipts
and expenditures. Treasurer Mor
rison lias adopted a system of book
keeping in which he classifies all
items in his ledger under the follow
ing headings: football, musical
clubs, baseball, track athletics,
Woman's Athletic Association, old
debts paid, and miscellaneous. The
exact status of any department of
the student body can be ascertained
by a reference to the footings of the
account in the ledger.
The committee found the receipts,
expenditures, and balances of the
various accounts up to Jan. 1, 185)7,
to be as follows:
FOOTBALL.
Receipts $8014 95
Expenditures 5408 75
Balance (fav.) $2611 20
MUSICAL CLUBS.
Receipts $1958 GO
Expenditures 2723 42
Balance (unfav.). . . . $7(54 82

Receipts $31 00
Expenditures 29 60

Receipts $ 0 00
Expenditures 1603 82
Balance (unfav.), , . ,$1603 82
TOTALS.
Receipts $10,415 95
Expenditures 10,140 49
Balance (fav.) $275 46
The musical clubs' trip ran into
1897, and a larger deficit is shown

in their account than really oc
curred, as the receipts after Janu
ary 1 were considerable.
The football account shows a
large favorable balance because all
the football bills had not yet been
paid at the time the books were be
ing audited.
The condition of the student
body was such at the beginning of
the year that if the student body
had closed up its affairs on Janu
ary 1 the assets would have bal
anced the liabilities and the stu
dent body Would have been out of
debt.
Last year at January I the stu
dent body was about $800 in debt,
and it was estimated that the debt
would be eliminated at the close of
the year. Notwithstanding this,
the student body found itself at the
beginning of last semester approx
imately $1800 in debt. The pres
ent auditing committee, therefore,
although contrary to precedent, is
decidedly averse to making any es
timates or prophesies as to the fu
ture prospects of the student body,
but recommends to the Executive
Committee the pursuance of the
present conservative policy.
