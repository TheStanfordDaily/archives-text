Not a little inconvenience is often
met with in the library when all
the members of a large class have
to prepare papers from one book.
It is often the case that some one
will get the book and sit visiting
with his neighbor or gazing dream
ily out of the window while many
others with more or less patience
wait perhaps several hours for an
opportunity to prepare their work.
