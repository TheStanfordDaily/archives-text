The attention of the Executive
Committee is called to the state of
the bulletin-board which is used by
the student body. The board is so
full of tacks and holes that it is
next to impossible to write upon it.

tacking of notices elsewhere, so that
this board may be reserved for the
writing of calls for meetings.
