One member of our staff writes
nearly all the headlines which we
use in this paper. Now the Berke
leyan on more than one occasion
has tilled as much as a half-column
with matter reprinted from this
paper without any sort of acknowl
edgment, though under new head
lines. That they should consider
our material worthy of republica
tion is of course a compliment to
us. But that they should reject
our headlines is a matter that fills
our headline writer with chagrin.
