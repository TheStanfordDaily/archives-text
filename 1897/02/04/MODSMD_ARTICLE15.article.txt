A movement was started at a
joint meeting of Euphronia, Philo
lexia, and Nestoria last Saturday
night to have a series of inter-soci
ety contests in debate under the aus
pices of the executive committee of

have been held in previous semes

forensic contests in which the mem
bers of each society are anxious to
win.
