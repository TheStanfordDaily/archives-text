It would seem that our college
patriotism amounts to very littie if
we take as a criterion the manner
in which our trophies are disposed
of. No attempt has ever been
made to care for them and no one
knows where they are. A few days
ago a heavily plated silver bowl,
which was presented to our athletes
by the Multnomah Club, was found
in a club-house on the campus
where it was in use as an umbrella
stand. Such shameless disregard
as this of University tradition and
of college pride is wholly unpardon
able. We fail to see what motive
or impulse could lead students to
abuse property in this way, espec
ially when the article in question
is a trophy that has been gained in
a contest with outsiders.
Football Manager Brown has
now undertaken the task of collect
ing these trophies and mementoes
and placing them where they may
be preserved. We hope that he
may be successful.
