Editor Daily Palo: The storm
during the last week has somewhat
dampened our baseball ardor. The
last day or so the campus lias been
utterly useless for baseball pur
poses, and thus not only practice
and class games have been delayed,
but the season's opening contest
between the Glee Club and Foot
ball nines had to be postponed.
The varsity team's great need at
present is a good pitcher. Several
candidates are out, and it is hoped
that before long a twister of puzzl
ing curves will be developed.
Last Friday afternoon there was
a meeting of the football team. He
sides the men themselves, Professors
Edwards and Bacon and Manager
Reinhardt attended The subject
under discussion was the advisabil
ity of having a committee with
power over football matters, the
committee to consist of a faculty
member, the coach, and the physi
cal director. The proposition was
very much like the one presented
to the student body last fall and
defeated by its vote. This commit
tee was intended to govern the
policy of the university in football,
and left to the captain the charge
of the men during contests only.
Professor Edwards and Manager
Reinhandt were in favor of the
scheme, while Professor Bacon was
against it. He said that taking
the government of such a strictly
undergraduate affair as football
out of the undergraduates' hands
would tend to increase our lack of
college spirit. When put to a vote
it was found that the team was
unanimously opposed to the motion.
We at Berkeley are watching
every move of the State Legislature
in regard to the Appropriation Bill,
and it is with fully as much inter
est as you of Palo Alto ever looked
forward to the outcome of the Stan
ford suit. The measure is perhaps
not so vital with us ao the suit
was to Stanford, yet its success will
put California in a position to make
tremendous advances. With its
aid only, can we go still futher to
the front among the universities of
America.
The final preliminary debate for
the Carnot medal took place last
Wednesday evening. From the ten
candidates who spoke on either sidi j
of the question, C. E. Fryer, A. C.
Marks of Hastings Law School, and
11 A. Overstreet were selected to
represent California at the coming
contest. The ha! was crowded,
and from the enthusiasm and abil
ity shown Berkeley still hopes for
another victory.
Great stimulus has been given to
target practice by our new rifle-pit.
The lumber and material was fur
nished by the university, while the
students furnished the work. The
pit is almost completed, and in a
few days those who will represent
the university in the intercollegiate
rifle contest will be able to practice.
