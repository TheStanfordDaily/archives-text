# SEQUOIA GIGANTEA.
## Another Communication on the Style of the University Weekly. 
### 
The controversy over the Sequoia
still continues. Yesterday ap
peared "Philistine's" communica
tion on the subject, and to this
Mr. Ilulme replies as follows:
Editor Daily Palo Alto: I wish
to reply to some of the misstate
ments contained in the communica
tion of "Philistine." In the first
place, there were not five numbers
of the Sequoia last semester that
contained only one article each by
undergraduates. Nob. 1,12,and 13
are the only ones that he can pos
sibly flaunt for his purpose. No.
1 contains the opening of Miss
Comstock's continued story, and in
addition, two book reviews by Mr.
Howard IÂ»el 1 and myself. No. 12
contains the longest installment of
Mr. Coolidge's story, which occupies
nearly six pages, and in addition,
the athletic page, written by Mr.
Culver. No. 13 contains a five-page
installment of Mr. Coolidge's story,
and two book reviews. 1 do not see
why these book reviews can not be
considered as "articles by under
graduates." They were written by
undergraduates. As to the books
reviewed being "obscure publica
tions," 1 am glad to be able to refer
"Philistine" to Dr. Jordan, Profes
sors Boss, Pol ley, and Show, among
others. "Philistine" needs someone
to tell him that such books as Mrs.
Ward's "Sir George Tressady,"
Eggleston's "Beginnings of a Na
tion," Cramer's "Method of Dar
win," Jordan's "Care and Culture
of Men," James Lane Allen's "Sum
mer in A ready," etc, are not "ob
scure publications," for he evidently
does not know so himself.
1 made no touching "complaint
concerning the low character of stu
dent contributions." On the con
trary I am delighted and gratified
at the remarkable showing made by
the student writers this year.
Never before has the Sequoia pub
lished such excellent stories by stu
dents as 1 )ane Coolidge's "Conscious
Freak of Ralph Jerome," Carolus
Ager's "Fate of Freshman Hatch,"
Will H. Irwin's "Padre Felipe,"
Miss Comstock's "Steep Rocks,"
Miss Jack's "Vassal Unto Love,"
Miss Boring's "Mountain Wed
ding," and many others. In verse
the students have not been less suc
cessful this year than in prose.
Their work is no longer a mere dis
play of tendencies; it now com
mands the respect of actual accom
plishment. Any undergraduate,
including "Philistine" himself, can
be sure of space in the Sequoia,
provided the work merits publica
tion. Thus far we have had to re
fuse only two manuscripts.
As to the reprinting of material
from the Annuals I would inform
"Philistine" that it has always been
customary to do so. Poems by Mr.
Neidig and myself have been re
printed from the Annuals in the
Sequoia in former years. Poems
and stories from the Overland, Ar
gonaut, Harvard Advocate, and
many Eastern magazines have been
reprinted in the Sequoia in former
years.
"Philistine" says that he does
not regard college weeklies from a
high literary standpoint. This
year we have endeavored to make

this possible with the Sequoia, and
"Philistine" can still watch the
progress of the men and women
\vhom he knows in college. This
year they are doing better than
ever. Mr. W. W. Guth, who was
the editor of the Sequoia for 1894-95,
writes us an enthusiastic letter in
which he said: "At last I am glad
that Stanford is to have a literary
magazine, and a weekly one at
that." Mr. Charles K. Field, than
whom no one is more deeply inter
ested in the welfare of the Sequoia,
has repeatedly expressed his ap
proval of the paper.
We do not eke out our subscrip
tion list by sending a copy of the
paper regularly "to every high
school on the Coast." True, we
have aimed to send the paper this
year to the principal high schools
of the Coast, but. in order to do this
we have stricken from our exchange
list many of the petty colleges of
the East, South, and Middle West,
believing that we would thus bene
lit the University. I believe that
"Philistine" is a person who knows
this well enough. 1 would now say
that we have a larger paid sub
scription list than the paper ever
had before.
1 am glad that "Philistine" has
so plainly disclosed the animus of
his opposition to the present man
agement of the Sequoia. Any per
son who is obliged to resort to false
hood and sneaking innuendoes to
effect his purpose can surely have
no other than a malicious motive.
And why does he masquerade under
a pseudonym? His covert sneer at
Mr. Lang's praise is pitifully inef
fectual. It speaks for itself. I
seem to have touched the am<.ur
propre of one who is accustomed to
such literature as "Moody's Let
ters,"and "Table No. 16," with
their stock of coarse and puerile
personalities. But he may rest as
sured that he has made a mistake
in relying upon falsehoods for an
argument, i can be quite sure of
having the support of the student
body when I have only such op
ponents as "Philistine." I can
gladly let him do his worst.
Friction always comes with the
initiation of a tradition; it seldom
attends the mere mechanical ful
filling of one. Those who lack
brains to originate, also lack brains
to appreciate a commendable in
novation. Such criticism as that
of "Philistine," bolstered as it. is
by falsehood, is plainly designed to
cast odium upon the management
of the Sequoia, rather than to offer
assistance by well meaning sugges
tion. Criticism that is merely neg
ative is at once the easiest, chea p
est, and most valueless thing in the
world. How much better would it
be did "Philistine" devote half the
energy to writing stories for the Se
quoia that he now employs in un
truthful fabrication.
