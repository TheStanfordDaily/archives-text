# THE 						SENIORS MEET.
## "Annual" Business Discussed-—Adjourned for Want of a Quorum. 
### 
Barely a quorum was present at
the meeting of the Senior Class this
afternoon. The committee that was
appointed to audit the accounts of
the business manager of the 'V>7
Annual made its report, which pro
voked an active and interesting
discussion. The committee found
that the indebtedness resting upon
the class amounted to $380, of
which sum $180 was represented by
goods held by the manager. Also,
140 copies of the Annual were num
bered among the assetsiif the class.
Manager Spencer offered to assume
the goods on hand at their cash
value, thus relieving the class of
$180 of the total debt and leaving
$'200 to l»e raised by assessment,
lie also asked that the Annuals
now on hand should be reckoned as
part of these assets which he as
sumed, and be given to him.
It was upon this latter proposi
tion that the most active discussion
was held. Several thought that
Mr. Spencer should be allowed a
portion of the Annuals, but many
were opposed to giving him the en
tire number. Several motions were
made and discussed, but no action
was taken on them. The point of
no quorum was raised and the
meeting adjourned.
