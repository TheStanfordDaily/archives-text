Those who walk between Palo
Alto and the University should
emulate the example of the cyclists
in improving the condition of the
road. The need of repairs is felt
more especially in rainy weather
when the road is almost impassable
because of so much water standing
on it. This work should also be done
for the sake of its appearance. As it
stands it looks badly neglected, and
to those who visit here it appears
doubly so as it contrasts poorly
with its beautiful surroundings. A
vigorous effort on the part of the
students should be made to have
this road repaired and beautified.
Some one is needed to take the in
itiative, and there is no time so op
portune for it as the present.
