# The 						Chapel Preacher.

### 
The chapel preacher for next
Sunday is Professor M. S. Cross,
Dean of the University of the Pa
cific. Professor Cross is an accom
plished scholar and earnest teacher,
and his sermons are manly and
straightforward. He has not ap
peared in the chapel list since 1893,
and he will doubtless be greated
by a large audience.
