## Philistine Says His Last Word in the "Sequoia" Controversy. 
### 
Replying to Mr. Hulme's hist
communication "Philistine" reveals
I)is identity and writes as follows:
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Stripped of numerous allusions
to "innuendos" and "sneaking
falsehoods' 1 and the depraved liter
al)' taste of "Philistine" which can
appreciate nothing higher than the
"vulgarity" of .Josh and the "puerile
personalities" of Moody's letters,
none of which allusions, by the
way, have any proper place in con
troversy, Mr. Hulme's defense is,
first, that "Philistine" has made a
miscount of the issues of the Se
quoia containing only one student
contribution; second, that some of
the books reviewed have not been
obscure: and third, that book re
views are student contributions.
Mis claims in regard to the paid
subscription list are interesting as
information, but do not carry any
weight in a discussion of the pol
icy of ilie Sequoia, since the list was
made up before the character
of the Sequoia was known. Fur
thermore, "Philistine" has no "ma
licious motive," and Mr. Hulme's
heroic resolve to "let him do his
worst" should make no one appre
hensive.
Without attempting a quantita
tive estimate of the student contri
butions in this year's Sequoia as
compared with those of last year,
it can not be denied that such mat
ter has occupied relatively much
less space this year than ever be
fore; that the list of student con
tributors, even including graduates,
has been much smaller than ever j
before; that there has been more re-!
printing done by this year's than
by any preceding Sequoia; that j
there has been a large number of!
outside contributions from Lang!
and others which, however excel
lent from a literary standpoint,!
should never have tilled the pages'
of any college weekly; that the
book reviews, however able, have
been of little or no value except
as exercise for the reviewers, in
view of the fact that any book
worth reviewing can be found fully
discussed in half a dozen first-class
literary monthlies. "Sir George i
Tressady" is an instance in point.!
It has been reviewed over and over j
again by the leading magazines in j
England and America; also by the j
Sequoia. In addition it can not be I
successfully denied that the Sequoia
this year has lost ground in the es
timation of the body of students.
Let us not lose sight of the main
point. The Sequoia\s chief mission
is the encouragement it gives or
should give to literary production!
by students. Under the present
management of the Sequoia, there
is no encouragement at all given to I
new writers. The paper is striving'
for recognition as a literary jour
nal apart from its functions as a
college magazine, and our young
authors are discouraged at the out-1
set from the fact that their work!
must come into competition with I
that of Andrew Lang and others.
The one great objection which Mr. I
Hulme has neither answered nor
attempted to answer is thefactthat
he is tilling the columns of the Se
quoia with the already published

work of outside authors.
J liitve nothing to say regarding
ihe remainder of Mr. H ulnae's last
article, lie has gone out of the
range of legitimate argument to in
dulge in personalities, and when a
discussion reaches this point it is
time that it ceased. (Jiving the lie
direct is not controversy. This,
therefore, is "Philistine's" last word
in the matter.
