The students at Berkeley are en
deavoring to secure a large num
ber of persons to accompany the
Carnot debaters to Palo Alto one
week hence. A special train will
run if a sufficient number of stu
dents can be secured to make the
trip. The projectors of the idea
feel that the presence of a large
number of Berkeley students at the
debate would serve both to encour
age the speakers from the State
University, and as an object lesson
to Stanford students.
