						NEW AGREEMENT.
## New Rules Formulated for Future Intercollegiate Debates. 
### 
The executive committee of the
Intercollegiate Debating League
met in San Francisco Saturday
afternoon. .J. M. Switzer, R. J.
O'Xeil, and J. T. Burcham repre
sented Stanford, and .J. T. O'Con
nor, .J. \\ . Leggett, and I). F. Mc-
W'ade were present for California.
After ;i prolonged discussion of the
clauses defining the eligibility of
debaters, and those relating to the
decision of the judges, an amicable
agreement was reached. Stanford
desired that undergraduates of the
academic department of either uni
versity should not be made ineli
gible on account of having a bach
elor's degree. California was will
ing to accept such a clause pro
vided it should be made to apply
at Hastings Law College, but as
Stanford was not willing to agree
t<> this the article of the old agree
ment upon the subject of eligibility
was left unamended. Manford
olso desired that the judges of de
bate should lÂ»e given explicit in
structions upon the weight to be
given to argument and presentation
respectively. As California desired
that this should be left to the dis
cretion of the judges, article 10 was
finally inserted as a compromise.
In all other respects the proceed
ings of the committee were liar-
Stanford won the toss for the op
tion of submitting the question or
choosing the side, and has until the
10th to make the choice. Thequcs
tion is to he submitted by the loth,
and the side selected by the 20th.
