Announcement has been made
that Herkeley will run a special
train to Palo Alto to accommodate
those who wish to attend the Car
not Debate here next Friday night.
We hope that satisfactory arrange
ments can be made. Every effort
should be made on our part to make
(be visit of our friends from across
the bay as pleasant as possible. It is
not often that Berkeley men are
seen on the quad, and it is desir
able that they should obtain as
good an impression as possible of
our hospitality. It might be in or
der to suggest the appointment of
a special reception committee to re
ceive and accommodate our visitors.
