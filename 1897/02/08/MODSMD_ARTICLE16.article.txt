# A 						Protest.

### 
The course in Art History is
very well attended this semester.
The students of the University have
shown appreciation of the opportu
nity given them to study the devel
opment of art, and, by so doing, to
define and cultivate their own
taste. Hut many students of Stan
ford have been taught that to show
disrespect to names and ideas
which others regard as sacred is
not an exhibition of good taste.
They shrink at finding in their
midst that form of Americanism
which leaps the chancel rail and
stamps about with muddy boots
and bat on head.
Of course it may be said that
those whose sensibilities are
wounded in the Art class are at
liberty to elect other work; but is
there any necessity of placing the
student —eager and interested in
this, to 11s, new line of study —in
the embarrassing position of hav
ing to choose between losing the in
struction he wants, or listening in
unprotesting silence to indelicacies
constantly uttered in connection
with the most sacred names?
Stanford has been called many
hard names which she does not de
serve. Shall the want of a little
consideration on the part of the in
structor and of outspoken protest
on the part of the ciass be allowed
to bring upon our «hn<i mater a
well-founded charge of utter Phil
istinism? A Student.
