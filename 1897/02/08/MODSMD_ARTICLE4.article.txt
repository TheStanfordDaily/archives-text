# THE 						CARNOT DEBATE.
## Stanford's Three Representatives Chosen Last Friday Night. 
### 
The preliminaries for the Carnot
Debate were held in the chapel Fri
day night to choose our representa
tives. There were six contestants
for places: A. B. Morgan, '98, S.
W. Charles, '98, H. W. Grunsky,
'99, Mrs. M. G. Hood, '99, E. E.
Painter, and C. M. Bradley,' 99.
Professor Earl Barnes presided and
Professors Brown, Abbott, and
Fairclough acted as judges. The
attendance was small.
The question for debate was: "Is
the centralization of French educa
tion conducive to the best social re
sults?" In his introductory re
marks, Prof. Barnes gave a brief
outline of the French school sys
tem.
The first speaker on the affirma
tive was Mr. Charles. He devoted
his time to an explanation of the
school system in France and a dis
cussion of the merits of centraliza
tion. Mr. Charles was followed by
Mr. Painter on the negative, who
attempted to show that the central
ized system offered possibilities of
political corruption and had other
defects that seriously militated
against the social welfare.
C. M. Bradley, the second speaker
on the affirmative, brought out the
benefits of uniformity in a school
system, lie showed how the uni
form system of education was con
ducive to national unity and patri
otism. Bradley was followed by
Mrs. Hood of the negative, who
made a strong rebuttal of the ar
guments advanced by the preceding
speaker. Her speech was forcible
and convincing.
A. B. Morgan, the third speaker
of the affirmative, spoke almost en
tirely in rebuttal. His principal
argument in favor of the system
was that education was the proper
function of the state and should
therefore be under complete state
control.
Mr. Grunsky continued for the
negative, showing the poor condi
tion of the public schools of France
at the present time, and tracing
these conditions to present social
evils. His argument was well pre
sented and very comprehensive.
Mr. Charles then closed the af
firmative si tie of the question with
a very able rebuttal of the negative
a rgutnents.
After a short discussion the
judges decided that Morgan,
Charles, and Mrs. Hood were best
able to represent the University in
the contest with Berkeley for the
Carnot medal. The debate will
take place next Friday night in the
chapel.
