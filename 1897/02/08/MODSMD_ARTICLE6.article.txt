The executive committee of the
Inter-Society Debating League met
Saturday evening unci discussed
plans fora series of inter-society
contests in debate. It was the
unanimous opinion of those pres
ent that a series of contests of this
kind would be preferable to the
joint meetings that have been held
in previous semesters. A sub-com
mittee of three, consisting of Roth
rock, 'DM, Miss Stoltenberg, '96, and
Hunt, '00, was appointed to formu
late a plan for the debates. An
other meeting of the whole commit
tee will be held tomorrow to act
upon the report of this sub-com
mittee.
