# REFORM FOR THE CO-OP.
## 
### 
The Hoard of Directors of the Co
operative Association have called a
meeting of the shareholders of the
association for March 1, at which a
new plan of organization will he
proposed, and an effort will he
made to abolish the present corpor
ation. Such a disincorporation ac
cording to the statutes under which
the corporation was organized re
quires a two-thirds vote of all the
capital stock. The proposed change
is the result of a desire on the part
of the hoard and the faculty to per
fect the present system.
Various other plans have heen
proposed and there is a difference
ut opinion as to what had better be
done. A number of professors, sev
eral members of the board, and
others have been interviewed on
the subject, and the following is
given as an attempt to place the
matter in a clear liuht before those
who are interested in remodeling
our present system.
E. 10. Farmer, president of the
Hoard of Directors, explained the
purpose and plan of the new organ
ization as follows: "The way in
which a reform of the Co-op. will
be attempted is. first, a disorgani
zation of the present Co-op.; and
second, a reorganization under the
state law of 18Wo governing the
formation of co-operative associa
tions. To accomplish this the
present board has called a meeting
of the shareholders for March 1, at
which there will be a full discus
sion of the matter. If two thirds
of the stockholders are in favor of
the new plan of organizing, the
Co-op. will be voted out of exist
ence.
" The purpose of the attempt of
the present board is to secure for
every student the privileges of the
Co-op. without any expenditure on
his part. It will do away with two
prices in the Co-op., which prevents
the board from being able to be
come acquainted with the exact
state of the business, and which in
creases the work and difficulties of
the manager. Two prices are also
a source of great dissatisfaction to
non members. The board under
the new organization will serve
longer terms, and the board
will not go out of office at the same
time. This will insure more per
manency in the management. The
board will be composed of both fac
ulty members and students.
'"The continuance of the present
system of Co-op. management will
undoubtedly result in its being
ruled off t he campus by the faculty,
as they consider that it does not
benefit the students enough to war
rant t he exclusion of outside com
petition. Unless some reform is
made, the Co-op. will be treated as
any other business firm run for
profit, and no exception will be
made in its favor. For this reason
reform is especially urgent.
â€¢'Objections which may be urged
against this plan can hardly be of
much weight. The shares are at
present worth virtually nothing,
and would be worth nothing if the
Co-op. was removed from the cam
pus. The stock of books on baud
is worth very little, and if divided

among the stockholders would
amount to a very small sum, while
it would mean life to the new or
ganization."
lTofessor Clias. I). Marx, a mem
ber of the Hoard of Directors, ex
pressed himself thus: "The plan
proposed by the board is simply to
disorganize the present Co-op. and
then to reorganize under the law of
bSilo with a new board of directors.
All students will be members. An
outside business man will be chosen
as a permanent manager, who will
be able to devote his entire atten
tion to the work. This, as far as
buying is concerned, will place us
in a better position with reference
to other business houses. With the
manager changing every year there
is a lack of stability which we have
to pay for. Stability commends it
self to business men and inspires
their confidence. The new system
will have no capital stock. The
new system means lower rates to
students, and every student in the
University will get the advantage
of them. That is the purpose of the
plan. If the plan is carried
through, the term of the board of
directors will be lengthened and
additional permanency will be se
cured. There will be no restriction
in the composition of ihe board; it!
may be of professors or students i
indifferently."
11. 1). Sheldon favors the plan
plan of reorganizing the Co op.,
with some qualifications. "In the
first place, the present board, before
gaining control of the majority of
stock, should give some positive
guarantee that the shares would
not be used in a political way.
Then it must be shown conclusively
that the new concern wi.l be an im
provement, and that it will be run
on a more business-like basis, with
a competent business man in
charge. If these things are assured,
I am in favor of the reorganiza
tion."
Dr. 1 loss has stated that he is
able to secure cheaper books for his
classes by ordering them through a
San Francisco house than through
the Co-op. "If the Co-op. is to con
tinue, it must be placed on a new |
basis, as it has outlived its present J
usefulness. In the first place, it is j
not as serviceable to the students as
it could be made, and as co-ops.
are in other colleges. The students
are the ones who suffer under the
present system, the professors being
able to secure large discounts on '
their purchases. Secondly, the
Co-op. can not be conducted to the
advantage of the students until it
is removed from the control of out
side stockholders. As long as the i
system of voting outside shares by
proxies prevails, the present system j
cannot be reformed. Again, con
trol of the Co-op. can not be placed j
in the proper bands until it is or
ganized as a co-operative body. In
order to get the control the students
should take the initiative, as they
are the ones directly concerned. To
accomplish anything this year it
must be done within the next two j
months." Professor Ross desires to i
see the Co-op. placed in the hands
of the students, as they would bei
better satisfied if it were under their
own control.
I\. H. Wilbur cilso favors student
control, staling his views thus:

"There are several d isadvantages in
the present system of Co-op. man
agement. The change of man
agers every year is a bad thing.
Every new man has to learn the
business, and after he has learned
it a new man takes his place. To
remedy this there are two alterna
tives: either have an outside man
appointed permanent manager with
a regular salary, or have a student
manager, with a provision that his
assistant, appointed either by the
manager or by the board, be the
successor in the business. I prefer
the latter. Then there is too much
political work connected with the
present system of election by proxies.
I think the proposed reorganization
as a co-operative association in
stead of the present stock company
would be a great improvement
along this line. lam in favor of a
system in which the students at
tending the University and using
the Co-op. shall have it in their con
trol."
F. L. Entler, of the present board,
also favors the new plan. He said:
"I am decidedly in favor of the
new organization. The objection of
the old members on the ground of
wanting to obtain a remuneration
for their shares should not be urged.
If the} 7 relinquish their claim the
new association will have some basis
upon which to work. They will
be helping to put the new company
on a footing by which it can buy
for cash and therefore sell cheaper.
If the new company has to pay
back the money for the old shares,
itcan not start under such favora
ble conditions, inasmuch as it will
be compelled to begin on a credit
basis, for there will be no capital
stock in the new concern. Every
student will have equal advantages
in the association. The advantages
to shareholders remaining in the
University will, in the way of
cheaper prices, more than counter
balance the amount of their shares.
Shareholders who graduate never
have received any value for their
shares. In my opinion this point
should not be urged against the
proposed plan."
Professor Barnes thus character
izes the present system: "The pres
ent scheme is entirely unbusiness
like, and the system of outside
proxies leads to abuses. The change
of managers results in a lack of
steadiness i n the business. We need
a permanent skilled management.
As to the merits of the new system
1 have not yet formed a judgment,
but the present system is utterly
wrong."
J. F. Barnett. the present man
ager, explained the difference be
tween old and new laws as follows:
"The law under which the Co-op.
now exists does not admit of an or
ganization suitable to the needs of
this community. The act of 1895,
passed for the incorporation of as
sociations only, admits of more
freedom of organization. Under
that law such an association can be
formed here as will meet the needs
of the University, and will be able
to obtain the confidence of the stu
dents and the encouragement of the
facultv."
The Hoard of Directors of the Co
operative Association have called a
meeting of the shareholders of the
association for March 1, at which a
new plan of organization will he
proposed, and an effort will he
made to abolish the present corpor
ation. Such a disincorporation ac

to other business houses. With the
manager changing every year there
is a lack of stability which we have
to pay for. Stability commends it
self to business men and inspires
their confidence. The new system
will have no capital stock. The
new system means lower rates to
students, and every student in the
University will get the advantage
of them. That is the purpose of the
plan. If the plan is carried
through, the term of the board of
directors will be lengthened and
additional permanency will be se
cured. There will be no restriction
in the composition of ihe board; it!
may be of professors or students i
indifferently."
11. 1). Sheldon favors the plan
plan of reorganizing the Co op.,
with some qualifications. "In the
first place, the present board, before
gaining control of the majority of
stock, should give some positive
guarantee that the shares would
not be used in a political way.
Then it must be shown conclusively
that the new concern wi.l be an im
provement, and that it will be run
on a more business-like basis, with
a competent business man in
charge. If these things are assured,
I am in favor of the reorganiza
tion."
Dr. 1 loss has stated that he is
able to secure cheaper books for his
classes by ordering them through a
San Francisco house than through
the Co-op. "If the Co-op. is to con
tinue, it must be placed on a new |
basis, as it has outlived its present J
usefulness. In the first place, it is j
not as serviceable to the students as
it could be made, and as co-ops.
are in other colleges. The students
are the ones who suffer under the
present system, the professors being
able to secure large discounts on '
their purchases. Secondly, the
Co-op. can not be conducted to the
advantage of the students until it
is removed from the control of out
side stockholders. As long as the i
system of voting outside shares by
proxies prevails, the present system j
cannot be reformed. Again, con
trol of the Co-op. can not be placed j
in the proper bands until it is or
ganized as a co-operative body. In
order to get the control the students
should take the initiative, as they
are the ones directly concerned. To
accomplish anything this year it
must be done within the next two j
months." Professor Ross desires to i
see the Co-op. placed in the hands
of the students, as they would bei
better satisfied if it were under their
own control.
I\. H. Wilbur cilso favors student
control, staling his views thus:

"There are several d isadvantages in
the present system of Co-op. man
agement. The change of man
agers every year is a bad thing.
Every new man has to learn the
business, and after he has learned
it a new man takes his place. To
remedy this there are two alterna
tives: either have an outside man
appointed permanent manager with
a regular salary, or have a student
manager, with a provision that his
assistant, appointed either by the
manager or by the board, be the
successor in the business. I prefer
the latter. Then there is too much
political work connected with the
present system of election by proxies.
I think the proposed reorganization
as a co-operative association in
stead of the present stock company
would be a great improvement
along this line. lam in favor of a
system in which the students at
tending the University and using
the Co-op. shall have it in their con
trol."
F. L. Entler, of the present board,
also favors the new plan. He said:
"I am decidedly in favor of the
new organization. The objection of
the old members on the ground of
wanting to obtain a remuneration
for their shares should not be urged.
If the} 7 relinquish their claim the
new association will have some basis
upon which to work. They will
be helping to put the new company
on a footing by which it can buy
for cash and therefore sell cheaper.
If the new company has to pay
back the money for the old shares,
itcan not start under such favora
ble conditions, inasmuch as it will
be compelled to begin on a credit
basis, for there will be no capital
stock in the new concern. Every
student will have equal advantages
in the association. The advantages
to shareholders remaining in the
University will, in the way of
cheaper prices, more than counter
balance the amount of their shares.
Shareholders who graduate never
have received any value for their
shares. In my opinion this point
should not be urged against the
proposed plan."
Professor Barnes thus character
izes the present system: "The pres
ent scheme is entirely unbusiness
like, and the system of outside
proxies leads to abuses. The change
of managers results in a lack of
steadiness i n the business. We need
a permanent skilled management.
As to the merits of the new system
1 have not yet formed a judgment,
but the present system is utterly
wrong."
J. F. Barnett. the present man
ager, explained the difference be
tween old and new laws as follows:
"The law under which the Co-op.
now exists does not admit of an or
ganization suitable to the needs of
this community. The act of 1895,
passed for the incorporation of as
sociations only, admits of more
freedom of organization. Under
that law such an association can be
formed here as will meet the needs
of the University, and will be able
to obtain the confidence of the stu
dents and the encouragement of the
facultv."
The Hoard of Directors of the Co
operative Association have called a
meeting of the shareholders of the
association for March 1, at which a
new plan of organization will he
proposed, and an effort will he
made to abolish the present corpor
ation. Such a disincorporation ac
cording to the statutes under which
the corporation was organized re
quires a two-thirds vote of all the
capital stock. The proposed change
is the result of a desire on the part
of the hoard and the faculty to per
fect the present system.
Various other plans have heen
proposed and there is a difference
ut opinion as to what had better be
done. A number of professors, sev
eral members of the board, and
others have been interviewed on
the subject, and the following is
given as an attempt to place the
matter in a clear liuht before those
who are interested in remodeling
our present system.
E. 10. Farmer, president of the
Hoard of Directors, explained the
purpose and plan of the new organ
ization as follows: "The way in
which a reform of the Co-op. will
be attempted is. first, a disorgani
zation of the present Co-op.; and
second, a reorganization under the
state law of 18Wo governing the
formation of co-operative associa
tions. To accomplish this the
present board has called a meeting
of the shareholders for March 1, at
which there will be a full discus
sion of the matter. If two thirds
of the stockholders are in favor of
the new plan of organizing, the
Co-op. will be voted out of exist
ence.
" The purpose of the attempt of
the present board is to secure for
every student the privileges of the
Co-op. without any expenditure on
his part. It will do away with two
prices in the Co-op., which prevents
the board from being able to be
come acquainted with the exact
state of the business, and which in
creases the work and difficulties of
the manager. Two prices are also
a source of great dissatisfaction to
non members. The board under
the new organization will serve
longer terms, and the board
will not go out of office at the same
time. This will insure more per
manency in the management. The
board will be composed of both fac
ulty members and students.
'"The continuance of the present
system of Co-op. management will
undoubtedly result in its being
ruled off t he campus by the faculty,
as they consider that it does not
benefit the students enough to war
rant t he exclusion of outside com
petition. Unless some reform is
made, the Co-op. will be treated as
any other business firm run for
profit, and no exception will be
made in its favor. For this reason
reform is especially urgent.
â€¢'Objections which may be urged
against this plan can hardly be of
much weight. The shares are at
present worth virtually nothing,
and would be worth nothing if the
Co-op. was removed from the cam
pus. The stock of books on baud
is worth very little, and if divided

among the stockholders would
amount to a very small sum, while
it would mean life to the new or
ganization."
lTofessor Clias. I). Marx, a mem
ber of the Hoard of Directors, ex
pressed himself thus: "The plan
proposed by the board is simply to
disorganize the present Co-op. and
then to reorganize under the law of
bSilo with a new board of directors.
All students will be members. An
outside business man will be chosen
as a permanent manager, who will
be able to devote his entire atten
tion to the work. This, as far as
buying is concerned, will place us
in a better position with reference
to other business houses. With the
manager changing every year there
is a lack of stability which we have
to pay for. Stability commends it
self to business men and inspires
their confidence. The new system
will have no capital stock. The
new system means lower rates to
students, and every student in the
University will get the advantage
of them. That is the purpose of the
plan. If the plan is carried
through, the term of the board of
directors will be lengthened and
additional permanency will be se

may be of professors or students i
