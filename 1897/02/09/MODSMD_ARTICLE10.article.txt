One unpleasant feature of the con
troversy that Dr. Jordan stirred up
by his recent address in Oakland
has been the misrepresentation
which newspapers and reporters
have given him. . If he had been
correctly quoted no notice might
have been taken of the views which
were expressed in the course of his
address; but the misquotations that
were applied to him, originating in
the over-excited superficiality of a
few journalists, have tortured that
address into an iconoclastic out
burst against everything connected

with religion or church organiza
tions.
Jn this connection, the following
from the editorial page of the Sac
ramtflito Record-I'nion is of in
terest:
President Jordan deals the San
Francisco city and its suburban re
porters a blow distinctly above the
belt that knocks them out. lie de
nies in so many words that what
they reported him to have said con
cerning religious revivals is a cor
rect report, lie declares that the
sentences they pretended to quote
were torn out of a context essential
to their understanding, lie did not
pronounce all religious revivals
hysterical mania nor rank insanity,
nor anything of the kind. Dr. Jor
dan politely, but not the less caus
tically, says that reporters are some
times given to error, but in the long
run the truth leaks through them.
His manuscript, he adds, is at the
service of clericists and others who
can thus see what he did say. lie
then rubs salt and pepper into the
wound by saying in conclusion that
no intelligent person who heard his
lecture could have misunderstood
him. That is absolutely cruelty,
merciless cruelty. The whole tem
pest in a pulpit comes of sending
men to report scientific lectures
whose intellectual measure for such
work gives them misfits on all
such occasions. The horse-reporter
would never have made the blunder
of the the ''bright young men'' who
attempted to wrestle with the ut
terances of a practical lecturer, who
declares that he and his order
always take especial pains to say
just what they mean, and mean just
what they say. The public owes
Dr. Jordan a debt of gratitude for
his polite rebuke. Soberly, the
methods employed by some of our
contemporaries are raw. It is not
so much the fault of the reporters,
either, as it is chargeable to the
compulsion that puts men at work
at that for which they have not the
intellectual capacity nor the prac
tical training.
