# Golden Gate Carnival.
## 
### 
The committees represent ing
Stanford and the University of
California on the proposed plan of
having a college day at the Golden
(iate Carnival, met Saturday after
noon in the Mills building, San
Francisco. Nothing definite was
arranged, hut it was agreed hy all
of the representatives that the plan
was very advisable.
Among other suggestions that
were made was the proposition to
have an intercollegiate baseball
game in the morning, the field-day
in the afternoon, and a concert by
the combined musical clubs of both
universities in the evening. It was
thought inexpedient to have a ball
in the evening as had been pro
posed by the Carnival managers.
