The sermon in the chapel Sun
day morning was delivered by Prof.
W. S.Cross, dean of the University
of the Pacitic. His text was Acts
xvii, 21 —"For all the Athenians
and strangers which were there
spent their time in nothing else but
either to tell or to hear some new
thing." His address was briefly as
follows:
A desire for knowledge is innate
in all, from the savage to the
philosopher. Ueligion and moral
knowledge are indispensable to the
mind of man. The question of
what knowledge is is often asked
and is answered in a variety of
ways. We are all seekers for re
ligious truth, and this truth may
be found by him who seeks it in
the right way.
There are two sorts of truth
seekers. One of these is the in
quisitive truth-seeker, seeking from
a mere desire to know something,
seeking like a child now and then,
without a definite purpose. Some
of these are so from love of the
beautiful or for the mere pleasure
of seeking. Much that passes for
love of truth is really love of some
thing else. Love of science for it
self alone is idolatry, though il is a
very chaste idolatry and has much
to commend it.
The other class is that of the
practical truth-seeker who goes
about the matter in a scientific
way and with his entire energy.
Byron says:"Truth is a gem that
loves the deep." One's whole life
experience is necessary to teach him
of (i()(1.
The genuine seeker after religious
truth is characterized by charity
for the convictions of others and a
desire that they also may find the
truth. Each church is bound to
respect the belief of other churches.
Still it has a right to put into def
inite form the substance of its be
lief and to require that those who
are to labor in it should be those
who believe as it does.
Truth has real value. It is a
strong staff to support our steps; it
is the pure coin with which we may
buy our eternal happiness; it is the
beautiful marble out of which we
may chisel our destiny. Live and
love truth. Seek the highest truth,
and though you may find little,
vou will find enough to live by.
