### 
Mr. Holme's answer to the part
ing communication of "Philistine,"
printed Friday, is given below. It
was intended for publication in
Monday's issue, but was crowded
out by other matter.
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The last communication of "Phil
istine," no longer an anonymous
personage, deserves a short answer.
1. 1 am unfortunately so ignor
ant as to know of no other way of
answering untruths and willful
distortion of fact than by direct
confutation.
2 Several thousand announce
ments, stating explicitly and in de
tail the character (if the Sequoia for
the present year, were printed
and distributed broadcast before a
single subscription to the paper
was solicited.
8. I have repeatedly answered
the "one great objection" to the
present policy of the Sequoia man
agement, namely, that of printing
; outside material. In the first place
I the editorials, which have formerly
occupied two pages, have been dis
pensed with, because it was thought
those of ihe Daily Palo Alto were
ample for all purposes. Then, no

such articles us the "Moody Let
ters" or "Table No. Ill" are printed,
for we deem them out of place in
the Sequoia. The space thus
gained is devoted to such outside
literature as we think will have a
special interest for the subscribers
of the paper.
4. The work of the student wri
ters does not have to come in com
petition with that of Mr. Lang and
others. They are not discouraged.
The best proof of this is the fact
that this year they have done bet
ter work than ever. "Philistine"
has evidently found this a difficult
point, for he has avoided it thus
far.
5. The book review department
answers the very purpose for which
"Philistine" claims the Sequoia was
intended. It is the expression of
student work in that line.
(3. 1 have never denied the fact
that there is some dissatisfaction
with the Sequoia. J simply ques
tioned the intention of a critic who
resorted to falsehood and gratuitous
sneers. But this is not the only
year that the paper has failed to
please everyone. Last year com
plaint was universal. Mr. \V. I*.
Chamberlain, who was one of the
ablest editors the Sequoia has ever
had, and who held oflice in 1898,
told me that he resigned quite as
much on account of the complaint
of certain students regarding the
paper as he did because of its poor
financial condition. For my own
part 1 am content to please the
patrons of the Sequoia whom 1
have succeeded in satisfying.
7. It avails "Philistine" nothing
to attempt to shift, in a jocose man
ner, the responsibility for personal
ities. His lirst letter is printed for
all who may care to read it.
It seems that in "Philistine" we
have a literary "banquet," if we
may accept the definition of that
word given by Birse, of the (ilen
Ouharity Pout, who explained it to
mean "juist twa dinners in one."
The defense of the present Sequoia
management here rests its case.
