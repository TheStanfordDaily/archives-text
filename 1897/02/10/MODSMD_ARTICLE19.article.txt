# Track Notes.

Now that the rains have ceased
and the track and field have dried,
regular training has begun. Capt.
Dole has already forty-two candi
dates on his list, and half as many
more may be out before the season
is over. Mr. King had a warm
shower put in the bath-room near
est his room on the second floor for
the use of the track men, but it had
to be taken down on account of the
flooded condition in which it put
the bath-room whenever it was
used.
Mr. King says that none of our
sprinters know how to start cor
rectly. He will therefore have to de
vote the first two weeks to teaching
them the first principles in getting
off the line quickly. As .Joe Ber
nard often said, pointing to the
starting line: "Many a race is won
and lost right there."
Some of the men were timed yes
terday in the sprints and in the dis
tance runs. Brunton came first in
the hundred. Smith was put on
scratch in the mile, and several new
men were given generous handi
caps, but Smith beat them all in,
finishing in a magnificent spurt in
5:09.
Polhemus ran a 220-yard dash
I for the first time. Ilis performance
was so creditable that he will doubt
less be kept at that event as well
as the high-jump, in which he is
also doing good work. Morgan,
Dole, and I'ope are working faith
fully Mt the hurdles, with Morgan
easily in the lead.
Murphy says he will be out
shortly to try for the 2'20-yard
I hurdles. Wilson is also training
l for this event and shows promise of
making a good hurdler. Mr. King
would like all who intend coming
(»ut. to do so as soon as possible,
lie intends putting considerable
I care and attention upon new men,
with a view to developing just as
j many of these ;is possible.
