# Our Baseball Coach.
## 
### 
W. A. Lange, who will remain
here about live weeks as baseball
coach, has already signed with the
Chicago team for next season. After
lie left here last year he went to
Galveston, where he began to train
for the season's work. He joined
the Chicago team and played with
it in the largest twelve cities of
the East comprising the National
League.
In regard to his work with our
men, Coach Lange expressed him
self as well pleased with last year's
work, and anticipated no great dif
ficulty in forming a strong aggrega
tion of baserunners this year. The
hardest positions to be filled are
those of pitcher and left Held, but
as he has not yet had an oppor
tunity to see the men in practise he
is unable to forecast the season's
prospects.
