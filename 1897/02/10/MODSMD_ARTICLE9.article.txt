### 
The committee appointed by the
president of the Inter-Society De
hating League to draw up plans for
inter-society contests lias reported
as follows:
We recommend that the live so
cieties draw for numbers, and that
the two societies represented by the
numbers one and two, and the so
cieties represented by the numbers
three and four, contest on the night
of the first meeting. That on the
night of the second meeting the
winners of these two contests de
bate for first place among the four
so far represented, and that the two
losers also contest on this night for
second place. That the winners of
this last debate contest with the
fifth society at the next meeting,
and if the fifth society wins, it will
debate tor the championship with
the society holding first place
among the first four.
We recommend, also, that each
society be represented by two men
in each debate; the two chosen by
them for the second contest, how
ever, not being the same persons
who are chosen for the first debate,
so that each society will be repre
sented by four men. Each man is
to have ten minutes for his argu
ment.
We recommend that the live so
cieties meet in joint meeting at
these contests; that the roll of all
the societies be called, and that
each society punish all reported ab
sences in their regular manner.
We recommend that a committee
of three be appointed by the presi
dent to arrange all matters relating
to meetings.
