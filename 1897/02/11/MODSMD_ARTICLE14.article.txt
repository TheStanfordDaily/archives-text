An apparent misunderstanding
lias arisen over the "protest" which
was published in Monday's issue,
reflecting on the instructor in the
class in Art History. That com
munication came to us as the ex
pression of an individual student's
opinion and professed to represent
nothing more. In fact we have as
certained that the sentiment of
the class does not uphold
"A student" in the protest,
and is disposed to resent the criti
cism which was made of the in
structor's work. In justice to the
latter, as well as to prevent a con
troversy upon a subject which
should never have been brought to

public notice, we feel that this ex
planation is necessary.
