state in their circular to sharehold
ers that it is their purpose to pre
sent the capital of the present com
pany to the proposed new associa
tion. This is an indirect way of
saying that shareholders will in no
ma nner he reimbursed for the $2 50
t bey have expended.
There are some doubts as to the
legal authority of a majority of
shareholders to thus confiscate the
property of a minority. The pro
posed gift can certainly not be de
fended on the grounds of common
justice, or even of necessity. The
capital of the present company be
longs to its stockholders, many of
whom regarded their investment as
a loan, to be more or less fully re
paid on leaving college by trans
ferring their share.
The property of the Co-op. now
amounts to iibout $4,000, and the
number of shares of stock sold is
about 700. The Co-op. began with
out capital or experience. The
new concern certainly ought to be
able to pay old shareholders some
tiling for the $ 1,000 gift it is to re
ceive.
Before any proxies are sent to the
board in response to their circular
it should he known whether the
board will use these proxies to de
feat a plan ore in burse sharehold
ers, ar.d thus vote directly against
the in lei est.- of tho.-e whose proxies

they hold. The circular states that
such is their ''purpose."
