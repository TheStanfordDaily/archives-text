# CARING FOR THE EYES.
## The 						Importance of Sound Organs of Sight in Student Life. 
### 
Much has been said about the
abuse of the eyes, and those who pos
sess good eyesight seldom realize
the important part which the visual
organs pi ay in helping us to form
our ideas of the world, and in the
development of our mental powers.
Precisely as otfier organs of the
body are exhausted by over-work,
and require rest to renew them, the
eyes which are subjected to contin
uous hard work and to all degrees
of light are seldom rested or prop
erly taken care of. If students who
work eontinously over their books
would attend to certain prudential
considerations, a great deal of need
less suffering might be prevented.
Work should not be carried on in a
strong or direct sunlight which
may be reflected into the eyes in a
harmful manner.
Students are often seen studying
with the full glare of a bright sun
light shining directly on their
pages. The light, reflected in this
way, is too strong and dazzling, and
produces temporary 1)1 indness many
times. In the same way it is harm
ful fora strong light to fall on the
eyes. Those who study out of doors
under shade trees will often find
the light to be unsteady, some
times strong and then weak, being
broken by the shadows of the
leaves; this also is of bad quality.
Those who are compelled to
study by artificial light are most
apt to suffer, because the light is so
often defective. The electric light
is the nearest like natural light and
consequently is best to study by,
and unlike sunlight it is best re
flected on the book, though not in
t he eyes.
It is generally conceded that
those who work over the micro
scope are apt to strain their eyes.
To avoid this one should look away
from the work often and entirely
relax the eyes. Heading should
not be continued more than ten
minutes at a time without glancing
off the book.
With very little effort 011 the part
of those in literary pursuits the
eyes can be well preserved during
many years of hard work.
