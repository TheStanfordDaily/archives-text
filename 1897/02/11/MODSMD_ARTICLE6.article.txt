| Editor Daily Palo Alto: The
most important happening to the
! university during the last week
' has been the Legislature's action in
I regard to our appropriation. The
Wright Hill passed ihe Assembly
I yesterday on a unanimous vote.
| To have seen the students when
j the news was received one would
have imagined that the bill had not
only passed both houses and had
been signed by the Governor, but
that also, money being plentiful,
j the students would hereafter be
! paid for attending our university,
i As ;i matter of fact the success of
the measure will not be decided
i until Friday when it will come up
1 before the Senate. So we look for
! ward to Friday with a fervent hope
that the two great decisions which
will be rendered on that day may
be propitious to our institution.
Our debaters are all in readiness
for that day.and as a number of
the students have decided to accom
pany our representatives to I'aio

: Alto, a special excursion is being
! arranged.
Jn athletics also has the week
been important. At the association
meeting on Thursday last Everett
Brown was elected our football
manager for the coming season.
He has been so successful as cap
tain of the track team that we ex
pect much from him in his new po
sition. Also Theodore I. Barnes
was elected track manager in the
place of S. A. Wood, resigned.
At last the long-talked-of foot
ball meeting has taken place, and
as a result we have for our next
captain Robert Haskell, a choice
that is very satisfactory, both to
: the players and to the student
body as well. Captain Haskell is
a student in the college of engineer
ing, and though he had no football
; practice before he entered the uni
| versity, he seems to have good com
j mand of the men and to be able to
| inspire considerable spirit into
i them.
I Now that the snn has dried the
! diamond, baseball enthusiasm once
more holds sway. Yesterday the
Juniors opened the season by de
feating the Seniors badly. Tomor
row afternoon the Sophomores and
Freshmen meet, while the long
postponed Glee Cluh-Footba.ll Team
game will probably come off Satur
day.
The U. C Wheelmen elected its
officers Friday afternoon, Slawson,
'98, being president. A trip to
Stanford was discussed, and the
club may appear in Palo Alto in
time for the Carnot Debate.
