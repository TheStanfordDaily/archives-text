Tonight the third annual con
test for the Canjot Medal will take
place in the chapel. This contest
between the two great universities
of the Pacific Coast does not attract

so much attention from the out-'
! side world as an athletic contest, j
but for this one night at least the j
! winner of tonight's debate will be a
hero in our midst. In debate there:
jis not the same room for accuracy j
of decision that there is in football i
I
or baseball. Two speeches have to j
be compared as two complex J
wholes, and judgment must al-1
most always differ about matters of
this kind. But the debaters who
take part tonight and their friends
who listen will accept without hesi
tation the judgment of the able
committee selected to decide upon
the merits of the debate. Whether
the medal comes to Stanford or
to California, we will all con
gratulate t he winner.
