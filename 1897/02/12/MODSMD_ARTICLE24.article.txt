# ADDRESS OF MRS. STANFORD.
## Plans of the Founders of the University Outlined to the Trustees. 
### 
Mr. <'Itairma a and members of
the Hoard of Trustees of Leland
Stanford Junior ( r ni'.r-ersity: In deed
ing to yon this home and its con
tents thin afternoon I am merely
carrying out the intentions of my
beloved husband and doing what
he would have done had I been
first called hence to the life eternal
and he remained here alone. In
bis last will and testament be dis-j
tinetly and at some length ex-;
pressed such intention. Therefore,!
while 1 am left alone to execute
this deed, it is In fact the deed of
both of us. And since this is the
first opportunity I have had of be
stowing, by myself, a gift upon stu- j
dents of behind Stanford .Junior
University, 1 deem it proper and j
fitting to give the Trustees a few
directions in regard to the future I
work, which, in the natural course j
of events, it must soon be their i
duty to carry out as managers and j
responsible custodians of that insti- j
tution, but which, for the present,
by the will of our Heavenly Father,!
devolves on me as sole surviving
founder of the I'niversity.
In the first place I hope the time
may come when this home, which I
is so dear to me, will be found use
ful as an affiliated college to behind
Stanford .Junior University, or as a
library for the use-of the students
of the I'niversity and the commit-j
nity at large: and it would gratify '
me exceedingly if I could fill it
with books and make it accessible
to all. Hut in whatever manner it i
may be ultimately decided that this!
home be used, 1 wish it to be ex
pressly understood that 1 direct
that it he devoted to the uses audi
service of belaud Stanford .Junior
University, and 1 direct and de
clare that it shall never be con-1
verted into a clubhouse, a boarding-1
house, or a place of undignified
a niusement.
In the second place, let me speak
of the honored President of the Uni
versity. Every year since his in-;
stallment his superior abilities, his j
remarkable influence upon the fac
ulty and students, and in return
their fidelity and loyalty to him,
have filled me with gratitude, j
That one so able, so scholarly, and
yet so approachable to all classes of;
society, so willing and ready to lec
ture and aid all institutions
throughout the State, many times j
making self-sacrifices to do so. j
should be among us, I am sure has!
caused California at large to feel
that my husband was wisely led
when he selected him for the posi
tion which he so ably fills. As for ;
myself, 1 could say much in his
praise, for he has tenderly and
manfully helped to lighten my bur-1
dens, and assumes the cares and;
responsibilities of bis position with
out any complaint, fearing to add
to my cares. I will only add that
my earnest and sincere prayer is j
that no circumstance may occur to (
take him from his present position
during the years in which the re
sponsibility still rests upon me. I
And I would like to think that his |
connect ion with my husband in the
past may serve as a link to bind
him to the University for many
years to come, when good old age
may still find him amid the scenes
of dear Palo Alto, blessed and
honored by the citizens of California
and the students and graduates,
that go forth each year to fill their
places in life.
What I am now about to say I
have frequently discussed with Dr.

.Jordan, but repeat it to you because
1 have been asked by several of the
Trustees to indicate to them some
of my wishes which it may be de
sirable for them to carry out when
they take upon themselves tlje re
sponsibilities.
A subject 1 feel most reverentially
under obligations to touch upon is
one of a religious nature. An im
pression exists in the minds of
many whose commendation and
strengthening prayers 1 need and
seek, that the students of the Uni
versity are not directly taught to
reverence God and His wonderful
works. 1' was God's goodness to
my husband and myself, as evi
denced in the many blessings we
received from Him, that inspired
our hearts with gratitude and gave
birth to this University. It seems
to me, therefore, most proper and
necessary that a reverence of Clod's
name should be one of the funda
mental truths there expounded. It
was such a feeling that caused my
husband to direct during his life
time that, while no particular sect
or creed should be allowed to in
trude on the University, there
should be taught therein "the im
mortality of the soul, the existence
of an all-wise and benevolent Cre
ator, and that obedience to His laws
is the highest duty of man." 1 will
here quote his own written words
to me on the subject: ''Religion is
intended as a comfort, a solace, a
necessity to the soul's welfare, and
whichever form of religion furnishes
the greatest comfort, the greatest
solace, is the form which should he
adopted, be its name what it may.
The best form of religion is trust in
God and a firm belief in the im
mortality of the soul, life ever
lasting."
Representatives of all denomina
tions without any restrictions are
invited to occupy the pulpit from
Sabbath to Sabbath at the Univer
sity, and I note with satisfaction
that the students as a rule attend
voluntarily in large numbers, and
listen with rare attentiveness to the
sermons preached. I also note with
gratification that there prevails
among them a deep and sincere re
ligious sentiment, as is shown by
the regular Sunday evening meet
ings attended chiefly by the young
men and women of the University.
1 feel assured that God has a place
in their hearts; therefore I have
thought that as soon as my finan
cial condition warranted it 1 would
like to establish a professorship of
Pible History, to be filled by one
who will teach it without any
prejudice.
In the next place, 1 would im
press on you the importance of a
subject near my heart, that of econ
omy being taught the students. A
student will be better fitted to battle
with the trials and tribulations of !
life if he (or she) has been taught
the worth of money, the necessity:
of saving and of overcoming a de
sire to imitate those who are better
off in the world's goods. For, when
he has learned how to save and bow
to control inordinate desires, he will
be relatively rich. During the past
three and a half years of close ob
servation on niv part, the import
ance of economy has impressed
itself forcibly upon me, and I wish
it to be taught to all students of the
University. Nature has made the
surroundings of the University
beautiful, and the substantial char
acter of the buildings gives them an
appearance of luxury. 1 wish this
natural beauty and comparative
luxury to impress upon the stu
dents the necessity of their preser
vation for the generations that are
to follow. The lesson thus taught 1

will remain with them through life
and help them to teach the lesson
to others. The University build
ings and grounds are for their use
while students, in trust for students
to come.
Another subject 1 have given
serious consideration to is that we
should not be ambitious to increase
the present number of students —
eleven hundred —for some years.
If our Heavenly Father spares me
to become the actual possessor of
the property it was intended should
be mine, it would afford me great
satisfaction to add some necessary
buildings — the chapel, library
building, chemical building, and
two additions to the museum —the
latter in order to have a place for
the works of art and curios I direct
to have removed there from my
home in this city, my home at Palo
Alto, and my home in Washington,
I). C., after my departure from
earthly life. Even with the ad
dition of these buildings the pres
ent number of students would only
be made comfortable, but they
could then use all the rooms in the
quadrangle, which are now over
crowded, as recitation rooms. These
buildings are needed, and 1 hope
the trustees will be able, in the
future, to build them, if 1 am not
during my lifetime.
The next subject to which 1
would call your special attention
in the future is the mechanical de
partments. 1 know full well how
important my husband considered
these departments. The large
workshops were fitted up at an
enormous expense with the very
finest, and best of machinery and
to ds. During the first two years
there were over a hundred students
busily engaged in learning how to
use their hands deftly and usefully
in the machine shops. This num
ber, from some cause which we
can not understand, has been stead
ily decreasing from year to year.
It was a theory of my husband
that the labor of a man whose
brain lias been developed in con
junction with skilled hands, made
him so superior to the ordinary
workman as to enable him to com
mand the highest compensation,
lie also felt that the presence of
these departments in the Univer
sity tended to greatly dignify labor.
Many of the students come to
this University because the advan
tages are free and because they
know that they will be obliged to
carve out their own future; and
with the encouragement which we
will give these departments in the
future they may gladly pursue this
course of study. The professional
world has more than its quota,
while the manual has still more
room for more skilled workmen.
If these departments are encour
aged, and work in the machine
shops and wood-working depart
ments are made major subjects,
their graduating classes would be
larger and would readily find re
sponsible positions. When you put
on the armor and take up the work
where I leave it, I charge you to
pay special attention to these
departments. Let. the laborer al
ways keep before him these words
of our precious Savior: "My
Father worketh hitherto, and I
work."
In the Act of the Legislature
under which the Leland Stanford
Junior University was founded and
is now in existence is the following
clause: "The person making the
grant may therein designate such
rules and regulations for the man
agement of the property conveyed
as the grantor may elect to pre-1
scribe; but such rules shall, unless

' the grantor otherwise prescribe, he
! deemed advisory only and shall
| not preclude suoh trustees from
' making such changes as new con
ditions may from time to time re-
Iquire." And in the same Act of
J the Legislature occurs the follow
ing clause: "And in all cases the
I powers and duties conferred and
j imposed by such grant upon the
I trustee or trustees therein named
■shall he exercised and performed
Iby the person making such grant,
)or by bis wife, during bis or her
- life, as the case may be; provided,
however, that upon the death of
I such person, or bis surviving wife,
as the case may be, such powers and
| duties shall devolve upon and shall
j be exercised by the trustees named
in the grant and their successors."
Now, therefore, under the terms
i of these clauses and in the exercise
of the powers that the Act of the
Legislature give, me, 1, as reniain
i ing grantor of Leland Stanford
•Junior University, do hereby elect
[and direct that in the future when
la vacancy or vacancies shall occur
jin the Hoard of Trustees (if said
! University, either by death, resig
nation, removal, inability to serve,
or by any other cause, said vacancy
or vacancies shall not be filled un
til the number of the members of
the Hoard of Trustees be reduced
by death, resignation, removal, in
ability to serve or for any other
cause, to the number of fifteen,
after which as a vacancy may oc
cur it shall be tilled in the manner
designated in the grant of endow
ment, but the number of trustees
shall thereafter never exceed fifteen.
In the Hoard of Trustees nine per
sons shall constitute a quorum,
but the assent of not less than a
majority of the whole, to wit, eight,
shall be necessary for affirmative
action in the execution of the trusts
herein contained.
And further, in accordance with
1 the provisions of the aforesaid Act
of the Legislature, 1 do hereby elect
to direct:
That from this time forth when
a member of the Hoard of Trustees
shall be appointed, he shall be ap
pointed for the term of ten years
i instead of, as heretofore, for life.
But this shall not apply to the
i members of the present Hoard of
i Trustees.
In explanation of these two
changes in the Hoard of Trustees I
j will state in regard to the first
j that during the last few years of
: my husband's lifetime he frequently
! discussed with me the advantages
{of a smaller board than one of
| twenty-four members, and the ad-
I visability of the number being
I some day reduced.
As regards the appointment of
members fora limited term of
years instead of for life, I have
: considered the matter from many
standpoints, carefully and prayer
-1 fully, and have had the advantage
{of the experience of other in
stitutions governed by boards of
trustees, with the result that 1
deem it important and beneficial
to make the change. This change,
however, does not apply to any
members of the present board.
In making alterations in the
r?
original grant of endowment I feel
'a solemn conviction that I am do-
I ing what my husband, were he still
with us, would have done.
Before closing, let me further
direct that in the course of time the
Hoard of Trustees shall elect and
number among its members many
'of the alumni of the University.
"Dear Father in Heaven, I wish
Thv will to be done—and not mine;
unless my will be Thy will, I ask
for Thine instead of mine."

What I am now about to say I
have frequently discussed with Dr.

.Jordan, but repeat it to you because
1 have been asked by several of the
Trustees to indicate to them some
of my wishes which it may be de
sirable for them to carry out when
they take upon themselves tlje re
sponsibilities.
A subject 1 feel most reverentially
under obligations to touch upon is
one of a religious nature. An im
pression exists in the minds of
many whose commendation and
strengthening prayers 1 need and
seek, that the students of the Uni
versity are not directly taught to
reverence God and His wonderful
works. 1' was God's goodness to
my husband and myself, as evi
denced in the many blessings we
received from Him, that inspired
our hearts with gratitude and gave
birth to this University. It seems
to me, therefore, most proper and
necessary that a reverence of Clod's
name should be one of the funda
mental truths there expounded. It
was such a feeling that caused my
husband to direct during his life
time that, while no particular sect
or creed should be allowed to in
trude on the University, there
should be taught therein "the im
mortality of the soul, the existence
of an all-wise and benevolent Cre
ator, and that obedience to His laws
is the highest duty of man." 1 will
here quote his own written words
to me on the subject: ''Religion is
intended as a comfort, a solace, a
necessity to the soul's welfare, and
whichever form of religion furnishes
the greatest comfort, the greatest
solace, is the form which should he
adopted, be its name what it may.
The best form of religion is trust in
God and a firm belief in the im
mortality of the soul, life ever
lasting."
Representatives of all denomina
tions without any restrictions are
invited to occupy the pulpit from
Sabbath to Sabbath at the Univer
sity, and I note with satisfaction
that the students as a rule attend
voluntarily in large numbers, and
listen with rare attentiveness to the
sermons preached. I also note with
gratification that there prevails
among them a deep and sincere re
ligious sentiment, as is shown by
the regular Sunday evening meet
ings attended chiefly by the young
men and women of the University.
1 feel assured that God has a place
in their hearts; therefore I have
thought that as soon as my finan
cial condition warranted it 1 would
like to establish a professorship of
Pible History, to be filled by one
who will teach it without any
prejudice.
In the next place, 1 would im
press on you the importance of a
subject near my heart, that of econ
omy being taught the students. A
student will be better fitted to battle
with the trials and tribulations of !
life if he (or she) has been taught
the worth of money, the necessity:
of saving and of overcoming a de
sire to imitate those who are better
off in the world's goods. For, when
he has learned how to save and bow
to control inordinate desires, he will
be relatively rich. During the past
three and a half years of close ob
servation on niv part, the import
ance of economy has impressed
itself forcibly upon me, and I wish
it to be taught to all students of the
University. Nature has made the
surroundings of the University
beautiful, and the substantial char
acter of the buildings gives them an
appearance of luxury. 1 wish this
natural beauty and comparative
luxury to impress upon the stu
dents the necessity of their preser
vation for the generations that are
to follow. The lesson thus taught 1

will remain with them through life
and help them to teach the lesson
to others. The University build
ings and grounds are for their use
while students, in trust for students
to come.
Another subject 1 have given
serious consideration to is that we
should not be ambitious to increase
the present number of students —
eleven hundred —for some years.
If our Heavenly Father spares me
to become the actual possessor of
the property it was intended should
be mine, it would afford me great
satisfaction to add some necessary
buildings — the chapel, library
building, chemical building, and
two additions to the museum —the
latter in order to have a place for
the works of art and curios I direct
to have removed there from my
home in this city, my home at Palo
Alto, and my home in Washington,
I). C., after my departure from
earthly life. Even with the ad
dition of these buildings the pres
ent number of students would only
be made comfortable, but they
could then use all the rooms in the
quadrangle, which are now over
crowded, as recitation rooms. These
buildings are needed, and 1 hope
the trustees will be able, in the
future, to build them, if 1 am not
during my lifetime.
The next subject to which 1
would call your special attention
in the future is the mechanical de
partments. 1 know full well how
important my husband considered
these departments. The large
workshops were fitted up at an
enormous expense with the very
finest, and best of machinery and
to ds. During the first two years
there were over a hundred students
busily engaged in learning how to
use their hands deftly and usefully
in the machine shops. This num
ber, from some cause which we
can not understand, has been stead
ily decreasing from year to year.
It was a theory of my husband
that the labor of a man whose
brain lias been developed in con
junction with skilled hands, made
him so superior to the ordinary
workman as to enable him to com
mand the highest compensation,
lie also felt that the presence of
these departments in the Univer
sity tended to greatly dignify labor.
Many of the students come to
this University because the advan
tages are free and because they
know that they will be obliged to
carve out their own future; and
with the encouragement which we
will give these departments in the
future they may gladly pursue this
course of study. The professional
world has more than its quota,
while the manual has still more
room for more skilled workmen.
If these departments are encour
aged, and work in the machine
shops and wood-working depart
ments are made major subjects,
their graduating classes would be
larger and would readily find re
sponsible positions. When you put
on the armor and take up the work
where I leave it, I charge you to
pay special attention to these
departments. Let. the laborer al
ways keep before him these words
of our precious Savior: "My
Father worketh hitherto, and I
work."
In the Act of the Legislature
under which the Leland Stanford
Junior University was founded and
is now in existence is the following
clause: "The person making the
grant may therein designate such
rules and regulations for the man
agement of the property conveyed
as the grantor may elect to pre-1
scribe; but such rules shall, unless

' the grantor otherwise prescribe, he
! deemed advisory only and shall
| not preclude suoh trustees from
' making such changes as new con
ditions may from time to time re-
Iquire." And in the same Act of
J the Legislature occurs the follow
ing clause: "And in all cases the
I powers and duties conferred and
j imposed by such grant upon the
I trustee or trustees therein named
■shall he exercised and performed
Iby the person making such grant,
)or by bis wife, during bis or her
- life, as the case may be; provided,
however, that upon the death of
I such person, or bis surviving wife,
as the case may be, such powers and
| duties shall devolve upon and shall
j be exercised by the trustees named
in the grant and their successors."
Now, therefore, under the terms
i of these clauses and in the exercise
of the powers that the Act of the
Legislature give, me, 1, as reniain
i ing grantor of Leland Stanford
•Junior University, do hereby elect
[and direct that in the future when
la vacancy or vacancies shall occur
jin the Hoard of Trustees (if said
! University, either by death, resig
nation, removal, inability to serve,
or by any other cause, said vacancy
or vacancies shall not be filled un
til the number of the members of
the Hoard of Trustees be reduced
by death, resignation, removal, in
ability to serve or for any other
cause, to the number of fifteen,
after which as a vacancy may oc
cur it shall be tilled in the manner
designated in the grant of endow
ment, but the number of trustees
shall thereafter never exceed fifteen.
In the Hoard of Trustees nine per
sons shall constitute a quorum,
but the assent of not less than a
majority of the whole, to wit, eight,
shall be necessary for affirmative
action in the execution of the trusts
herein contained.
And further, in accordance with
1 the provisions of the aforesaid Act
of the Legislature, 1 do hereby elect
to direct:
That from this time forth when
a member of the Hoard of Trustees
shall be appointed, he shall be ap
pointed for the term of ten years
i instead of, as heretofore, for life.
But this shall not apply to the
i members of the present Hoard of
i Trustees.
In explanation of these two
changes in the Hoard of Trustees I
j will state in regard to the first
j that during the last few years of
: my husband's lifetime he frequently
! discussed with me the advantages
{of a smaller board than one of
| twenty-four members, and the ad-
I visability of the number being
I some day reduced.
As regards the appointment of
members fora limited term of
years instead of for life, I have
: considered the matter from many
standpoints, carefully and prayer
-1 fully, and have had the advantage
{of the experience of other in
stitutions governed by boards of
trustees, with the result that 1
deem it important and beneficial
to make the change. This change,
however, does not apply to any
members of the present board.
In making alterations in the
r?
original grant of endowment I feel
'a solemn conviction that I am do-
I ing what my husband, were he still
with us, would have done.
Before closing, let me further
direct that in the course of time the
Hoard of Trustees shall elect and
number among its members many
'of the alumni of the University.
"Dear Father in Heaven, I wish
Thv will to be done—and not mine;
unless my will be Thy will, I ask
for Thine instead of mine."
Mr. <'Itairma a and members of
the Hoard of Trustees of Leland
Stanford Junior ( r ni'.r-ersity: In deed
ing to yon this home and its con
tents thin afternoon I am merely
carrying out the intentions of my
beloved husband and doing what
he would have done had I been
first called hence to the life eternal
and he remained here alone. In
bis last will and testament be dis-j
tinetly and at some length ex-;
pressed such intention. Therefore,!
while 1 am left alone to execute
this deed, it is In fact the deed of
both of us. And since this is the
first opportunity I have had of be
stowing, by myself, a gift upon stu- j
dents of behind Stanford .Junior
University, 1 deem it proper and j
fitting to give the Trustees a few
directions in regard to the future I
work, which, in the natural course j
of events, it must soon be their i
duty to carry out as managers and j
responsible custodians of that insti- j
tution, but which, for the present,
by the will of our Heavenly Father,!
devolves on me as sole surviving
founder of the I'niversity.
In the first place I hope the time
may come when this home, which I
is so dear to me, will be found use
ful as an affiliated college to behind
Stanford .Junior University, or as a
library for the use-of the students
of the I'niversity and the commit-j
nity at large: and it would gratify '
me exceedingly if I could fill it
with books and make it accessible
to all. Hut in whatever manner it i
may be ultimately decided that this!
home be used, 1 wish it to be ex
pressly understood that 1 direct
that it he devoted to the uses audi
service of belaud Stanford .Junior
University, and 1 direct and de
clare that it shall never be con-1
verted into a clubhouse, a boarding-1
house, or a place of undignified
a niusement.
In the second place, let me speak
of the honored President of the Uni
versity. Every year since his in-;
stallment his superior abilities, his j
remarkable influence upon the fac
ulty and students, and in return
their fidelity and loyalty to him,
have filled me with gratitude, j
That one so able, so scholarly, and
yet so approachable to all classes of;
society, so willing and ready to lec
ture and aid all institutions
throughout the State, many times j
making self-sacrifices to do so. j
should be among us, I am sure has!
caused California at large to feel
that my husband was wisely led
when he selected him for the posi
tion which he so ably fills. As for ;
myself, 1 could say much in his
praise, for he has tenderly and
manfully helped to lighten my bur-1
dens, and assumes the cares and;
responsibilities of bis position with
out any complaint, fearing to add
to my cares. I will only add that
my earnest and sincere prayer is j
that no circumstance may occur to (
take him from his present position
during the years in which the re
sponsibility still rests upon me. I
And I would like to think that his |
connect ion with my husband in the
past may serve as a link to bind
him to the University for many
years to come, when good old age
may still find him amid the scenes
of dear Palo Alto, blessed and
honored by the citizens of California
and the students and graduates,
that go forth each year to fill their
places in life.
What I am now about to say I

will remain with them through life
and help them to teach the lesson
to others. The University build
ings and grounds are for their use
while students, in trust for students
to come.
Another subject 1 have given
serious consideration to is that we
should not be ambitious to increase
the present number of students —
eleven hundred —for some years.
If our Heavenly Father spares me
to become the actual possessor of
the property it was intended should
be mine, it would afford me great
satisfaction to add some necessary
buildings — the chapel, library
building, chemical building, and
two additions to the museum —the
latter in order to have a place for
the works of art and curios I direct
to have removed there from my
home in this city, my home at Palo
Alto, and my home in Washington,
I). C., after my departure from
earthly life. Even with the ad
dition of these buildings the pres
ent number of students would only
be made comfortable, but they
could then use all the rooms in the
quadrangle, which are now over
crowded, as recitation rooms. These
buildings are needed, and 1 hope
the trustees will be able, in the
future, to build them, if 1 am not
during my lifetime.
The next subject to which 1
would call your special attention
in the future is the mechanical de
partments. 1 know full well how
important my husband considered
these departments. The large
workshops were fitted up at an
enormous expense with the very
finest, and best of machinery and
to ds. During the first two years
there were over a hundred students
busily engaged in learning how to
use their hands deftly and usefully
in the machine shops. This num
ber, from some cause which we
can not understand, has been stead
ily decreasing from year to year.
It was a theory of my husband
that the labor of a man whose
brain lias been developed in con
junction with skilled hands, made
him so superior to the ordinary
workman as to enable him to com
mand the highest compensation,
lie also felt that the presence of
these departments in the Univer
sity tended to greatly dignify labor.
Many of the students come to
this University because the advan
tages are free and because they
know that they will be obliged to
carve out their own future; and
with the encouragement which we
will give these departments in the
future they may gladly pursue this
course of study. The professional
world has more than its quota,
while the manual has still more
room for more skilled workmen.
If these departments are encour
aged, and work in the machine
shops and wood-working depart
ments are made major subjects,
their graduating classes would be
larger and would readily find re
sponsible positions. When you put
on the armor and take up the work
where I leave it, I charge you to
pay special attention to these
departments. Let. the laborer al
ways keep before him these words
of our precious Savior: "My
Father worketh hitherto, and I
work."
In the Act of the Legislature
under which the Leland Stanford
Junior University was founded and
is now in existence is the following
clause: "The person making the
grant may therein designate such
rules and regulations for the man
agement of the property conveyed
as the grantor may elect to pre-1
scribe; but such rules shall, unless

' the grantor otherwise prescribe, he
! deemed advisory only and shall
| not preclude suoh trustees from
' making such changes as new con
ditions may from time to time re-
Iquire." And in the same Act of
J the Legislature occurs the follow
ing clause: "And in all cases the
I powers and duties conferred and
j imposed by such grant upon the
I trustee or trustees therein named
■shall he exercised and performed
Iby the person making such grant,
)or by bis wife, during bis or her
- life, as the case may be; provided,
however, that upon the death of
I such person, or bis surviving wife,
as the case may be, such powers and
| duties shall devolve upon and shall
j be exercised by the trustees named
in the grant and their successors."
Now, therefore, under the terms
i of these clauses and in the exercise
of the powers that the Act of the
Legislature give, me, 1, as reniain
i ing grantor of Leland Stanford
•Junior University, do hereby elect
[and direct that in the future when
la vacancy or vacancies shall occur
jin the Hoard of Trustees (if said
! University, either by death, resig
nation, removal, inability to serve,
or by any other cause, said vacancy
or vacancies shall not be filled un
til the number of the members of
the Hoard of Trustees be reduced
by death, resignation, removal, in
ability to serve or for any other
cause, to the number of fifteen,
after which as a vacancy may oc
cur it shall be tilled in the manner
designated in the grant of endow
ment, but the number of trustees
shall thereafter never exceed fifteen.
In the Hoard of Trustees nine per
sons shall constitute a quorum,
but the assent of not less than a
majority of the whole, to wit, eight,
shall be necessary for affirmative
action in the execution of the trusts
herein contained.
And further, in accordance with
1 the provisions of the aforesaid Act
of the Legislature, 1 do hereby elect
to direct:
That from this time forth when
a member of the Hoard of Trustees
shall be appointed, he shall be ap
pointed for the term of ten years
i instead of, as heretofore, for life.
But this shall not apply to the
i members of the present Hoard of
i Trustees.
In explanation of these two
changes in the Hoard of Trustees I
j will state in regard to the first
j that during the last few years of
: my husband's lifetime he frequently
! discussed with me the advantages
{of a smaller board than one of
| twenty-four members, and the ad-
I visability of the number being
I some day reduced.
As regards the appointment of
members fora limited term of
years instead of for life, I have
: considered the matter from many
standpoints, carefully and prayer
-1 fully, and have had the advantage
{of the experience of other in
stitutions governed by boards of
trustees, with the result that 1
deem it important and beneficial
to make the change. This change,
however, does not apply to any
members of the present board.
In making alterations in the
r?
original grant of endowment I feel
'a solemn conviction that I am do-
I ing what my husband, were he still
with us, would have done.
Before closing, let me further
direct that in the course of time the
Hoard of Trustees shall elect and
number among its members many
'of the alumni of the University.
"Dear Father in Heaven, I wish
Thv will to be done—and not mine;
unless my will be Thy will, I ask
for Thine instead of mine."
