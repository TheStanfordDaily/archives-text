The baseball team returned yes
terday afternoon from Santa Clara
after being defeated 12 to 0 by the
Santa Clara College team. The
failure of the Stanford team to
bring back a victory may he attrib
uted to lack of practise and team
work on their part. Beckett occu
pied the pitcher's box for the first
seven innings, and although he had
practised but twice previous to the
game, tilled his position very ac
ceptably. This is shown by the
fact that only nine bits were made
during the seven innings.
