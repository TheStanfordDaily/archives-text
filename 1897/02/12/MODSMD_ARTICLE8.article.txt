# Prominent Men as Educators.
## 
### 
The news that Secretary Olney
has been offered the chair of Inter
national Law at Harvard is but an
other evidence of a progressive
spirit which seems never to be lack
ing in the policy of that univer
sity. The selection of men as edu
cators who have achieved notable
successes outside the fields of edu
cation creates an inspiration for
students, the value of which edu
cational institutions have always
been quick to recognize. This mat
ter calls to mind the unoccupied

Billings chair in English at Yale.
We have no doubt that the univer
sity officers are still endeavoring to
secure a man for this position who
will he a distinct addition to liter
ary Yale. The English depart
ment, it is pretty genera 11}' agreed,
is the one branch of Yale education
that above all others needs bolster
ing, and the sooner its one unoccu
pied chair is well filled the better
it will be for the study at Yale. â€”
