# BERKELEY WINS THE MEDAL.
## Overstreet of California Defeats Morgan by a Very Narrow Margin. 
### 
Before an immense audience
composed of students and adher
ents of the two great California
universities, the representatives of'
Berkeley and Stanford met Friday
evening for the third debate for the
Carnot medal. The University of
California was represented hy at
least one hundred persons, ami the
'Ha! Ha! Ha! California!"' blended
with the sharp'"Rah! Rah! Rah! - '
of Stanford in a pleasing and
friendly unison. Good feeling was
at its height and never fora single
moment did zealous loyalty to one's
own college gain the upper hand or
manifest itself in the behavior of !
the audience. Jt was a jolly, en
thusiastic college crowd.
Professor J. M.Siillnian presided!
and introduced the speakers j
Mayor James 1). Phelan, Attorney |
Charles Page of San Francisco, and j
Rev. Edward L. Parsons of Menlo
Park officiated as judges. Prof. !
Charles .Mills (Jayley of the Uni-i
versity of California kept time for
the Berkeley speakers, and 1)r. j
11<iss timed those of Stanford
After the statement of the ques
tion, "Is the French system of edti- 1
cation more conducive to the wel-i
fare of the French state than would i
be ;i system like that of the United
States," Mr. Charles E. Fryer of I
T • • 1 • •
the University of California was
introduced to speak on the affirm- 1
alive. He pointed out the differ-j
ence that exists between conditions
in France and in the United States,
and held that the mere fact of the!
success of the decentralized system
here would not argue for its sue- !
cess abroad.
When A. B. Morgan stepped to
the front of the rostrum he was
greeted with a round ot applause, |
for it was upon him that Stanford I
had built her h<>| >t ss of success, i
His argument was based upon thej
failure of the centralized system of
education to foster principles of j
democracy and of morality. Hav-I
ing failed in these two great funda-j
mental principles, it should he
superseded by a system which had j
worked with success in these direc
tions.
Mrs. Margaret Graham Hood fol-1
lowed for the affirmative. Her j
speech was clear and decisive audi
her delivery forcible. The chief j
point of her argument was the fact
that the centralized system makes
it possible to lia ve a large corps of:
trained specialists, whereas under
the American, system there is lack j
of this co-ordinating influence
Mr. Allen C. Marks of the Uni-I
versitv of California spoke second
on the negative, and was followed
by Mr. 11. A. Overstreet of the af-j
tinnative, who made the most pol-I
ished address of the evening and!
the speech that won him the medal ;
Mr. S. W. Charles of Stanford'
closed the debate for the negative.
At the conclusion of the debate
the judges retired, and after fifteen
minutes deliberation the decision
was read by Mayor Phelan. The'
judges were unable to come to a|
unanimous decision because of the!
narrow margin between the speeches
of Morgan and Overstreet: on spon
taoeitv thev were unanimous for

Morgan, but style and classical fin
ish won the medal for Overstreet.
Stanford gave the U. C. yell and
the Berkeley men returned the
conij liment. Dr. Sti 11 man ex
tended congratulations to the win
ner of the medal and to the uni
versity that be represented, and the
third Carnot Debate was at an end.
Mr. Harry A. Overstreet, the
winner of the Carnot medal, is a
j graduate of the Lowell High School
lof San Francisco. He entered the
! University of California with the
class of '98, in the College of Let
ters, taking as his major study phi
losophy and jurisprudence, lie is
one of ihe associate editors of the
University of California Magazine,
and expects to enter the legal pro
; fession. He is a member of Beta
Theta Pi.
Professor Charles Mills Gayley,
; head of the department of English
at the University of California, has
had the speakers in training for
about three weeks. He expressed
I himself as exceedingly well pleased
| with the debate and with the tnan-
I ner in which his students acquitted
themselves. He acknowledged Mor
j gan to be an able speaker, but said
! that Overstreel's classical ease and
grace gave him the decision.
Dr.E.A Ross, who has had charge
jof Stanford's interests in the de
bate, and to whom is due all the
| credit that attaches to us for the
showing that we made, said that
Berkeley merited the decision, not
because we did not have the best
i debater, but because their team
averaged higher than ours, and
because throughout there were ev
; idenees of longer study and of
| greater acquaintance.with the sub
ject. of discussion. While Morgan
may have merited the award, this
University merited defeat. '"It is
as foolish,"' he said, "to rest our
; case on one star debater as it would
be for Berkeley to build her football
j team on one star player. If we
had taken one fourth the interest
in the debate that we did in the
! football contest, we should have
j had fifteen men entered on Jan
i uary'2i) instead of four. If Stan
ford really attaches so much im
portance to athletics and so little
Ito debating, we deserve defeat
j whether an individual debater
i merits success or not."
