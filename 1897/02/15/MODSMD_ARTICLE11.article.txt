### 
Concerning the address which
preceded Mrs. Stanford's presenta
tion of the deed to her home in San
Francisco to the University trus
tees, the Call on Saturday made
the following editorial comment:
"As the gift itself was not unex
pected the chief interest in the oc
casion lies in the address with which
the gracious doner accompanied it.i
lleing the first direct gift from her
hiindstothe students of Stanford
University it was natural that she j
should speak wiih some fulness of
the work of the University, and the
aims she and Senator Stanford had
in founding it. What she said forms
;i document which will not only he
;i precious record for the University
at I'alo Alto, hut nmy he read with
advantage and edification hy all
who are interested in the training
and development of the human
mind. . . . The salient points are
the words spoken for instruction
in matters of religion and economy.
These subjects are the fundamen
tals of every life, and there can he
no full development of the soul or
the intellect unless due attention is
paid to them."'
