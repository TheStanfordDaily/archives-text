# Chapel Lecture.
## 
### 
The Stanford Press Club lias
made an innovation by arranging
fora lecture by a newspaper man
on topics closely associated with
newspaper work. The lecture to
morrow night in the chapel gives
promise of being one of the most
entertaining of thesemesler. There
will be no lantern slides exhibited,
but anyone who enjoys reminis
cences of historic personages related

by one to whom they were persona 1
experiences, can not afford to miss
John Conner's lecture. Jt is not n
formal address. As he expresses
it : "1 do not propose to lecture to
yon, hut simply, with your kind
permission, to indulge in an infor-1
mal conversational chat ahout peo
ple 1 have met."
Mr. Bonner is universally ad
mired among San Francisco news-;
paper men, and outside of journal-J
istic circles lie is known everywhere
as a cultured gentleman, a brilliant
writer, and an influential citizen.)
He was born in Quebec, Canada,
arid was graduated from Queen's;
College, Kingston, when he was fif
teen. and completed his education;
in France. He is an accomplished
French scholar and has a cyclo-â– 
pa'dic knowledge of French history.
Lately he has I een turning his at
tention somewhat to the early hist
ory of California. The breadth of
his culture would make h in an
honor to any profession.
As an editorial writer for years;
on the New York Herald under the
elder Bennett, and as editor for
six years of Harper's Weekly, he
made an honored name for himself j
in New York journalism. For lliej
last twelve years he has made San
Francisco bis home. The homage
rendered him there is not the fawn-1
ing bestowed upon a man who hap- i
pens to occupy a place of power.
It is purely tribute to his attain
ments, ability, and character.
