# REVIVALS AND THEIR EFFECT.
## President Jordan Speaks on the Putting Away of Childish Things. 
### 
President Jordan spoke yesterday J
morning in the chapel on "Putting i
away childish things," taking his
text from 1. Corinthians, xiii, 2. |
He spoke as follows:
In what 1 shall have to say this |
morning I shall not speak as a
preacher hut as a teacher, or rather
as a learner, for old as the world is j
we have much to learn as to the
best way from childhood to man-j
hood. J trust that my words may j
l>e gentle, true, and helpful. 1 am j
sure that they will he helpful if
they are ti ue.
The ceremonies and customs of
man rest on a basis of truth, else
they would not endure. Man's ex
perience justifies them, else they I
would not be. Sometimes the cus
tom outlasts the need for it. When ,
this is the case it is because its]
foundation in human nature is I
misunderstood. Imitation, the j
power of association, the strength of,
organization, give life to ceremonies
long after they have ceased to stand
for reality. But before we condemn
any ceremony or custom we should I
study the basis upon which it rests, j
In the great historic churches of j
Europe, in one way or another, the
ceremony of confirmation is recog- j
nized. It is thought in those
churches that confirmation is the 1
visible sign of the beginning of re-j
ligious maturity. It means the i
putting away of childish things. It j
means the substitution of serious
religious purpose for the line-on-1
sciousness of childhood. In the!
preparation for continuation, as I j
know the ceremony in many
churches, both teacher and minis
ter take part. The one tries to
show the human side of a well-or-j
dered life, the other its religious
significance. Confirmation is not
the cause of self-devotion, but it,
stands as its mark and testimony.
Nor are the conditions that sur
round this ceremony without justi-!
tication in human life. This time
is preceded by a period of sadness,!
uncertainty, unrest. It is followed
bv calmness and joy, the satisfac
tion of a definite purpose. The
young man or woman has a feel
ing that there is more in life than
he had supposed. It is richer and
nobler than he had thought it, else
he would have taken it seriously be
fore. Yesterday the girl was a
child—today she is a woman. To
day the boy begins to be a man,
and the growth of a purpose in the
heart opens the doors to the growth
of human love, the central force in
the life of the normal man or wo
man.
The influence of the excitement
of others produces excitement in
you, whether it have a cause or
not. As a frightened horse will
stampede a herd, so the frightened
man may stampede an army. In
like manner the various derange
ments which go under the name of
hysteria are catching. The frenzy
of mobs passes from man to man,
and the whole mass is tilled with
the desire to kill.
All of these are cases of insanity
that have no relation to religion,
that have nothing to do with nor
mal conversion or change of life,

and their effect is evil and wholly
evil. Religion worthy of the name
is Jin expression of the highest san
ity. Religion of one form or an
other must he the central axis of
the successful life.
But mere emotion without pur
pose of action is not religion. Ex
citement of the nerves for the mere
pleasure of excitement has no en
nobling influence. It tends to
weaken the will, to enfeeble the
mind, to produce that condition of
spiritual lassitude which shows it
self in chronic conversion. When
one ''falls from grace" readily he
has not far to fall, vet even these
persons are entitled to gentle judg
ment. They would have fallen
farther had they been let alone.
Jt was to reach those who had
passed the period of confirmation
without entering upon any form of
new life th.it the process of conver
sion was brought into play. This,
like the other, was no new thing.
It was no modern discovery, but
rests in the needs of human nature
itself. It was the individualization
of religion. The idea of conversion
is not that of confirming in the
right way—but of turning about one
who is in the wrong way. To this
end every force available has been
brought to bear. The longer the
individual has gone on the wrong
track the more main strength is re
quired to bring him on the right
one. Hence the development of
every influence that could come
from the presence of numbers, from
the power of song, from the fear of
the wrath to come, from the hope
of a material heaven, the dread of
a material world of torment.
And the result has been, in
many cases, a turning about-—not
an instantaneous changing of char
acter, for character is the resultant
of many actions —but an instanta
neous change of direction in life.
This is what the word conversion
means. And this may be perma
nent or not, 'according to the
strength of character of the indi
vidual who is affected, according to
the undercurrents already at work,
and according to the influences
which later may be brought into
his life.
The lesson to us is that one
should lie temperate in all things;
that religion shows itself in lofty
ideals steadily followed in a clean
life and a pure heart. .Sterile emo
tions are not religion; and hysteria,
of the same nature as drunkenness,
may be even more dangerous, be
cause it comes forth unawares and
because it may seem to come un
der the protection of the honored
chu rch.
There is no right way for the de
velopment of all men. Each one
must live his own life, pass through
his own changes. He can be helped
by others, but this help must be
given to liini wisely; and in this
connection the work of the minis
ter has an importance a few of us
realize. He is to deal with the
most delicate part of the nature of
man —the part that is the most
easily injured by bunglers, the part
tint can be most helped by the in
fluence of true piety. To teach
young men and women the way of
life, we need the noblest, wisest,
and purest men in the calling of
the ministry.
