It is of course a matter of regret
that our rival across the bay was
able to take the Oarnot medal from
our own chapel this year. Although
this is not the proper time to find
excuses and propose remedies that
would have won us the debate, a
warning sounded now may save us
in the Intercollegiate and possibly
in future Carnot debates.
It was plainly to be seen that
our speakers last Friday night
lacked all that training and polish
in style and in speech which went
far toward Berkeley's victory. The
only quality in which we excelled,
and in one speaker only, was spon
taneity. This is. however, a per
sonal trait, while the other points
to be taken into consideration, in
which we are notably deficient, are
the results of proper training. The
careful coaching that the California
speakers had undergone showed
clearly in their form and delivery.

The fact is, we sent ;i team that h:ul
had hut a week's preparation and
jno training against a rival team
coached for many weeks by two
j ahle men. Under such conditions
how could we expect victory?
