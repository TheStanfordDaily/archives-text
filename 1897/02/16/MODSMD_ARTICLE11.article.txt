The musical clubs are showing a
commendable activity in their at
tempts to discharge their obliga
tion to the student body by giving
concerts in the neighboring towns.
If they succeed and demonstrate by
the close of the year that they are
a paying proposition, it will do
much towards placing them on
terms of equality with the other
student organizations and remov
ing the prejudices against them
that seem to exist in the minds of
a certain class of students. It
should also result in a more satis
factory and thorough incorporation
of the clul>3 into our student body
system.
