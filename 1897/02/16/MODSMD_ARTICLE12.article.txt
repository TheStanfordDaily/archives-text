Some of the lower classes do not
show in their conduct at the close
of recitation hours that courtesy
which they owe to their professors.
Immediately after the ringing of
the gong there is a shuttling of feet
and a gathering of books and wraps
which makes the closing words of
every lecture inaudible and unin
telligible. The professor delivering
a lecture has presumably gauged it
with sufficient accuracy to be able
to close his remarks in a few short
sentences, which may be of much
importance. These remarks should
be heard with attention, and soon
afterwards the class should be dis
missed. As charity begins at
home, so it may be that politeness
and courtesy begin in the class
room.
