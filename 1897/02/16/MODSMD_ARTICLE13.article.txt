The committee in charge of the
Sophomore Cotillion deserves com
mendation for arranging to carry
on the bus system at this year's Co
tillion. Although no commission
will be received by the class on the
fare paid the bus men, the arrange
ment should pay the class finan
cially in an indirect way. It should
insure increased receipts by secur
ing a larger attendance at the dance
than there would otherwise be.
There is always present at an
event of this kind that tendency
toward rivalry in expense which
eventually leads to extreme extrav
agance among those who can af
ford it (and among many of those
who can not), and to the total ex
clusion of those who fall below the

high standard established. So long
as it majority of those attending
hops go in carriages it will he con
sidered somewhat bourgeois to go in
any other way; for human nature
is so constituted that no one likes
to accept what his associates will
not have. People in this world are
not oppressed by poverty half so
much as by the fear to acknowledge
that their neighbors are better off
than they. The evils in society at
large which owe their origin to this
trait of human character are visible
in a not much less degree under
the surface of college life.
The constant struggle of man
with his environment, which leads
to a gradual betterment of human
welfare and to a higher standard of
life from every point of view, is
certainly one of the most hopeful
things about our civilization. Bui
every effort should be put forth to
encourage those of slender means to
live within them until an improve
ment in their condition can IÂ»e
brought about in the usual and le
gitimate way.
