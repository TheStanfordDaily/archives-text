# Lecture On Dante.
## 
### 
Dr. Lnigi Ventura addressed j
it number of students yester
day afternoon on '"Dante." Dr.!
Ventura is a graduate of the Uni
versity of Naples, having studied
also in France. He was for eight
years a teacher of French and Ital
ian in Boston, and for nine years
on the staff of Dr. Sanveur. He
taught in Beloit College, Wiscon-1
sin. and in Grinnell College, lowa, |
from which he recently went to San
.lose. He was for two years 1 he J
private secretary of Tonnnaso Sal
vi ni, and is the author of "Peppino" ■
and the translator of much of the
standard literature of France and
Italy.
He prefaced his lecture with
readings from the third canto of

"I'urgatorio." In giving an ac
count of the great poet of Italy, he
said that the lives of him already
written are mostly romances. He
spoke of Dante's early life and
education, dwelling on his love —
"the greatest event of his life."
Dante saw his Beatrice, went
home, slept, dreamed of her, and
wrote his dream in verse. She was
more of an angel to him than a
woman. After her death he turned
to philosophy. Later we find him
implicated in political and civil af
fairs. In 1802 on false accusations
he was covered with infamy and
driven from his beloved Florence,
never to return. Thus the sensitive
poet was obliged to undergo the
bitterness of disappointed love and
of exile from home.
