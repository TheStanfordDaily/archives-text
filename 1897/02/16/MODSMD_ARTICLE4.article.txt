# Track Notes.

On Monday, February 22, trees
are to I»e planted around the track
in order to form a wind break when
sufficiently grown. A greater part
of the work must be furnished by
the student body, and there is no
reason why everyone in track work
should not spend the afternoon in
doing a small part of this work.
The occasional rains are interfer
ing with regular work on the track.
But in spite of all interruptions, and
despite the fact that it is still early
in the season, some of the men are
showing up remarkably well. Last
evening Brunton ran a fast 220,
beating out several men who had
handicaps ranging from eight to
H.xteen yards. Brown trotted a
half-mile in 2:08, Walker and Wil
liams coming in a good second and
third. Freeman and Fickert are
doing well in the shot, and Haz
zard is improving daily in the "two
turn" throw. Dole has not yet at
tained his old form in the pole-vault.
During the next few weeks several
field-days will be held, inter-class
events and try-outs for new men.
While none of the candidates are
required to sign pledgee, yet the
men are all supposed to keep reg
ularly at work and to conform to
the same rules that governed the
football men. Candidates who are
known to disobey these and who
persistently shirk their training
will be dropped from the team.
