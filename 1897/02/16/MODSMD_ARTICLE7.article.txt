# THE 						CO-OP. AGITATION.
## Another Communication Regarding the Changes Proposed. 
### 
The following communication
has been received in reply to a com
munication by "â–ºShareholder" pub
lished a few days ago in regard to
paying Co-op. shareholders for their
stock when the association is reor
ganized:
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The question of the remuneration
to the stock holders of the Co-op.
has been considered by the board
of directors and the difficulties of
making a sale to a new corporation,
which will have no capital stock,
led to the solution proposed, of
making a gift of the assets of the
old company to the new. Further
more, il is the only one that would
give life to a new association
founded on so generous a basis as
the one planned. In the new as
sociation, should the present plans
be consummated, every student will
receive equal benefits, with no in
itial expenditure for membership,
which, il is hoped, will draw the
trade of many of those who at the
present time are non-members and
do much of their buying elsewhere.
An increase in business means a
corresponding increase in discounts,
as the running expenses, up to a
certain limit, will remain the same.
The assets, consisting largely of
books, will reach a value, not of
$4,000, as erroneously claimed, but
of something over half that amount.
Hut it must be distinctly under
stood that this does not mean that
the books, under forced sale, would
bring so much, or in fact anywhere
near that amount. A large portion
of them are college text-books, which
a jobber would have difficulty in
disposing of, and would therefore
hesitate to take at almost any
price.
The investment in a share was
made, in most cases, for the bene
fits which such an association could
offer, and. with the exception of re
cent purchasers of shares, members
have received benefits more than
equal to the price paid for the
sha res.
Should the plan fail to carry, the
new association would be obliged to
sell shares to commence business,
thus introducing one of the most
objectionable features of the pres
ent system. In order to ever adopt
the desirable plan of universal
membership among the students it
would require the same amount of
injustice either to the new share
holder or to those who would have
to pay the extra price attached to
the books to make sufficient profit
to buy back these shares.
A distribution of books among
the members would be practically
impossible, since the individual
books have values differing from
and in excess of the amount that
could be returned to each share
holder. There will be but few, if
any, shareholders willing to pay the
difference fora book they do not
want.
Taking everything into consider
ation, the board has arrived at the
solution outlined in the circular as
the simplest and most satisfactory.
Expressions in favor of this plan
have also been given by every mem
ber of the faculty whom I have in
terviewed. Should, at the meeting

which will be called for the consid
eration of this question, any better
plan be evolved than the one out
lined by the present board, I feel
sure that they stand ready to adopt
it. E. E. Farmkr, Pres.
