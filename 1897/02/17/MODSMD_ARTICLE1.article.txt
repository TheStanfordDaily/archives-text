# NEWSPAPER REMINISCENCES.
## Mr. John Bonner Gives an Account of his Journalistic Experience. 
### 
Under the auspices of the Stan
ford Press Club, Mr. John Bonner
of San Francisco spoke last even
ing in the chapel. The talk was
devoted to reminiscences of Mr.
Bonner's work as a journalist, and
of his association with noted men
of the period of the war. He was
introduced hy President .Jordan as
"a friend of learning, a friend of
Stanford, and a friend of all of us.''
Mr. Bonner hegan by explaining
that lie was no orator, but a plain
old man who had lived many years
and had seen many persons and
things. Some of these he had re
membered, he said, and would
speak of them in a little talk with
out any attempt at oratory or elo
quence.
< )f his connection with the forma
tion of the Republican party, Mr.
Bonner spoke at length, lie was
one of the number of Democrats
who left that party to assist in the
organization of the new party. On
the occasion of Abraham Lincoln's
visit to New York, Mr. Bonner was
in the audience anil stood close to
the platform while Mr. Lincoln
spoke. Some of the opponents of
the new party were determined to
break up the meeting and prevent
Mr. Lincoln from speaking. Mr.
Bonner and bis friends were afraid
this might be done; consequently
they wen* much surprised to find
the front rows of the auditorium oc
cupied by a delegation of prize
lighters who bad been hired for the
purpose of protecting Mr. Lincoln.
Mr Bonner went to Washington
to witness the inauguration cere
monies, going lirst to the Senate
chamber where a violent discussion
was in progress. The Senate w is
in session from seven in the even
ing until noon of the next* day
War was imminent. When the
(dock struck twelve the Senate rose
in a bodv and marched out to the
'broad platform where the inaugu
ral proceedings were to be held.
Sit great was the confusion that Mr.
Bonner was enabled to join the
senators and tco with them as one
of their number. In this way lie
reached the platform before which
an audience of over twenty thou
sand people was assembled.
Mr. Lincoln arose to deliver his
address and every one noted the
massive strength ami purpose of
will that was delineated on his
countenance. Yet his soul was one
of gentleness, and he was a man of
infinite tenderness. Intense pur
pose was written on his face, but
beneath this was a spirit of sadness.
He seemed to foresee that a war
was inevitable, and that it would
Ie long a nil violent.
Mr. Bonner then described events
in New York before the war, and
told of his acquaintance with Com
modore Vanderbilt and Jay Gould.
He recited many incidents of the
fortunes and reverses of the war,
and of the contending interests that
were affected by the result.
Taking up his career as a jour
nalist., Mr. Bonner spoke of his in
timate association with the elder
Bennett, whose paper was run on
the principle of giving the people
just what they wauled, without
much regard to principle or policy.

Horace (ireeley was a totally dif
ferent man. He took up readily
with all sorts of isms and ideas.
He told the people through his
paper what he believed to he right
and true, and did not care whether
this was what they wanted or not.
Henry J. Raymond, another of the
early New York journalists, was a
man superior to either, and came to
New York from Vermont. He was
a man of high attainments and of
unquestioned integrity. He always
failed, however, of recognition.
The talk of Mr. Bonner was in
teresting in the extreme, and he
proved himself to he a capital en
tertainer.
