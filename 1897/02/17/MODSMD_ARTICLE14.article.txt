If it be true that some members
of the Freshman Class have in
mind plans for breaking up the
Sophomore Cotillion, the editor of

taking any such step. They may
think themselves justified in inter

was made on the Freshman (ilee.
Hut they should remember that
sophomores alone were not respon
sible for that offense, and the few
sophomores that were implicated in
the affair did not appear as repre
sentatives of the Sophomore Class
any more than the juniors and
seniors who were present repre
sented their respective class organi
zations. Besides, a retaliatory
spirit is hardly becoming to uni
versity students, and the freshmen
should be above it, as we hope they
are.
