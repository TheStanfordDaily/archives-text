Somkof (he statements whicl) have
appeared in the Daily 1'.m.0 Ai.to
regarding the Carnot Debate have
led our student readers to believe
that they are being criticised fora
failure to show the proper amount
of interest in the intercollegiate
contest which Inis just taken place.
This has brought us some commun
ications on the subject of debating
which state the position of the stu
dents very clearly, but which we
have not room to publish. We
wish it understood that the criti
cism implied was not intended.
The students certainly did all in
their power to further our chances
of success in the contest for the
Carnot medal, hut the realization
that defeat was almost certain
stared them in the face from the
first and acted as a powerful
damper on their enthusiasm. It is
the general opinion of our debaters
that student interest was not lack
ing, but that so much can not be
said of the interest manifested by
the faculty. It is asserted that the
members of this body did not take
one half the interest in this forensic
contest that is always shown by
them in the muscular contests be
tween the two universities. There
are a few very marked excep

tions, but up a whole it can not be
ilen iecl that our faculty is somewhat
apathetic to tlie intercollegiate de
bating contests. So long as this is
true, student support and student
enthusiasm will count for nothing.
