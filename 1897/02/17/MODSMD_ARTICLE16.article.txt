•Some Berkeley students seem to
have misunderstood Stanford's at
titude with respect to the Carnot
Debate. Complaint conies from
them that Stanford is sore over the
result and that we are seeking to
•'rob them of part of the fruits of a
hard-earned victory." r J he cause
of this is the statement published
in the city papers to the effect that
Professor < Jay ley conceded the
medal to Morgan before the judges
had announced their decision. Out
of this they have built up a case
against us that reflects very seri
ously on our readiness to accept a
defeat when properly administered.
The representatives of the press
were seated quite near Professor
(iayley and were in a position to
hear whatever he might have said.
It they quoted him incorrectly they
alone are to blame, and Berkeley
should not have imagined that the
whole sentiment here sought in any
way to discredit their victory.
Everyone admitted that the contest
was close and that Overstreet Won
because of the classical training
that Professor (Jayley had given
him. No one had any intention of
belittling the efforts of Berkeley's
speakers; we knew that they de
served the medal, and regretted
that our representatives bad not
had the same training.
But what is the use of quibbling
over a circumstance of this kind?
Stanford's attitude when our con
testants have met with defeat lias
always been manly, frank, and
generous. We have never chal
lenged the victories of our oppo
nents, and we have never ques
tioned the integrity of those who
gave victory to them.
