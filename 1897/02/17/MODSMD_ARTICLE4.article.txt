The following editorial appeared
in yesterday's Rerkeleynn:
The student body of the Univer
sity of California desires to express
its sincere appreciation of the un
limited kindness and consideration
shown by the Stanford students to
our visitors at the Carnot Debate.
Nothing was left undone that a stu
dent body could do to entertain a
body of visitors from a sister insti
tution. We now await a time when
we can give them some return for
their kindness bv entertaining a
Stanford excursion in Berkeley.
