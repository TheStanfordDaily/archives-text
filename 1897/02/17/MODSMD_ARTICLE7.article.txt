The Varsity baseball team will
play a nine from Santa Cruz on the
campus Friday, the Piute Indians
at San Jose Saturday, and the
Santa Cruz team Monday at Santa
Cruz. Manager James met with
more success in getting games with
outside teams this year than has
been experienced before. A game
with the Olympics is expected. An
attempt has been made to get
special cars put on the train leav
ing Palo Alto at 1 1 :40 to see the
game at San .Jose Saturday. Re
turning, the excursionists would
reach Palo Alto station at 5:40. If
parties of fifteen are made up, it is
thought that special rates can be
secured. Coach Lange purposes to
have a base-running contest soon.
Time will be taken with a stop
watch to determine who our fastest
base-runners are.
