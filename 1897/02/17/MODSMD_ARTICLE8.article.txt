# Piutes vs. Varsity.
## 
### 
A game of baseball between the
Varsity and the Piute Indian team
was arranged for next Saturday
afternoon in San Jose at a confer
ence between Manager James of
Stanford and Manager Pulsifer,
who has charge of the Indian
players.
The Piute Indian team comes
from the Wadsworth reservation in
Nevada, where the members attend
an Indian training school. The
team is now on a trip during a va
cation in the school. Last week
the Piutes made their debut in San
Francisco in a game with the Ala
meda Alerts, losing the game by a
score of six to two. The team is
composed as follows: Moo, e;
Aquarta, p; Sputta, lb; Wishshon,
ss; Zubie, If; Daubuke, If; Dahu, rf
The Indian boys are a clever lot of

nthletes and are undoubtedly the
best Indian team ever organized.
They are clever fielders, but Bee in
lo lie weak at the hat. Their
pitclier Aquarta is said to have
good curves and speed. The team
is well acquainted with the game,
and their agility and quickness are
rem a rkable.
After the game with Stanford
Saturday afternoon the I'iutes
leave for Los Angeles, where they
will play three games with Tufts-
Lyons, returning later to Siin
Francisco for two games. Their
trip will consume a month's time.
The hatting order of the Varsity
lims not yet been decided. Coach
Lange, however, has been chosen to
umpire the game.
