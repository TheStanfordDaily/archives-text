# SENIORS ANNIHILATED.
## First of the Series of Class Games Won by the Juniors. 
### 
Yesterday's inter-class game was
won hy the Juniors by a score of
18 to 1. The Juniors assert that
the new white ''plugs" rattled their
opponents, while the Seniors at
tribute their defeat to their unlucky
number of errors, thirteen. Only
twice during the game did the
Seniors have a chance to howl;
mice when McLaine made a de
spairing dash for home and slid
under .lefts' outstreached arms, and
once when a section of the grand
stand gave away under a crowd of
over-enthusiastic Juniors. And
there was a dog tight, which also
served as a distraction.
"i)S began by scoring three or
four tallies in the first inning, and
then scored three or four more in
most of the other innings. McLaine
scored '97's only run hy stealing
home from third while tlie ball was
being passed between catcher and
pitcher. Young, the big first-base
man, smashed the bail out into
left field for his side's only safe hit-
About the only redeeming feature
of '97's play was the work of Leach,
a new recruit from the University
oi' Missouri.
All of the '98 men hit the ball,
Klauber leading. Many hits to the
left of the diamond went safe; how
ever, they would have been secured
by a practiced thi rd-baseman.
Clematis did not have much dilli
culty with the Senior baiters, only
two of whom belong to Ihe regular
baseball squad, as compared to six
of his own side.
