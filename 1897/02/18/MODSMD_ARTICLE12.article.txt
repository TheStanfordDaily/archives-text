One of the historic days that will
ever he remembered by those who
were in the University sit the time
it was passing through the trying
siege of legal controversy is the sec
ond day of March. It was on that
day that the Supreme Court of the
United States handed down the de
cision that insured the perma
nency of our beloved institution
and the fulfillment of the desires of
its honored founders. None of us
will ever forget the celebration we
had when the joyous news was re
ceived; and while we rejoiced that
the ordeal was over, yet we could
not but feel that the trial had been

good for us, that it had developed
within us a patriotism and a loy
alty that would endure and stand
the test of future disappointment.
We have among us now a large
number of new students who have
not had this experience and who
perhaps do not know that the pros
pects for the University's future
were not always so bright as they
are now. Might it not be well to
suggest the holding of some sort of
celebration to commemorate our
victory and to revive again the
glory that was ours on that second
day itf March, 1896?
