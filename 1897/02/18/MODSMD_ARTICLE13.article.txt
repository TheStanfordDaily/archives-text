In the course of an editorial com
menting on disorder in the library,
the Ncbmskan of recent date has
the following:
But the universal disorder in the
library for the last few days bids
us to make a timely remark. It
certainly should not require the
librarian to be persistently urging
students to be quiet, and to stop
unnecessary laughing and whisper
ing. Of course the guilty parties
are not conscious that they are dis
turbing those who are busy in their
studies. For, to be sure, they would
not think of doing anything of the
kind. In Leland Stanford Jr. Uni
versity and others, whispering is al
lowed only by those in charge.
Hut here, we regret to say, the av
erage student does more talking
than the librarian and her assist
ants together.
[How might we all rejoice were
it really true. — Ed ]
