# Regulation of Athletics.

Jii a recent article Caspar Whit
ney has said:
Three university presidents have
recently given public expression to
the opinion that genera! athletics
in moderation are of great benefit
to the student body, and of ques
tionable value if carried to excess.
There is no new light revealed in j
this opinion, nor is the statement
applicable to athletics only; it has '
equal pertinence to any branch of
human endeavor. But it suggests,
the thought that there would be
less occasion for disquietude if col
lege faculties addressed themselves
to internal remedies rather than to
public bulletins.' The physician j
who stops short with a diagnosis of
a case gives no relief to the sufferer.
We have had before us the anal
ysis of the situation for certainly
the past five years, and the best
skill obtainable continuously em
ployed administering such medi
cines as the disease seemed to re
quire and the patient could endure.
It the highest skill in university
life has not been enlisted, it was
not for want of seeking, or because
authority was lacking had the in- 1
clination to offer its advice been
stirring.
