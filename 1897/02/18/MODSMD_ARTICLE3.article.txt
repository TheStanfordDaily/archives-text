Editor .Daily Palo Alto: Of
course, to us of Berkeley the result
of the Carnot Debate was most
pleasing; and especially so was it to
those who accompanied our repre
sentatives to Palo Alto. The kind
and courteous treatment displayed
hy Stanford was such that it would
he rudeness not to thank her for it,
and we all hope that we may soon
be able to show a like kindness to
Stanford students who may visit
Berkeley. When one notes the re
sults of our intercollegiate contests
in brain and brawn, one can not
but observe the similar..outcome of
the two great universities of the
East, where Harvard carries off the
honors in debate and Yale in ath
letics.
Last Tuesday the football men
met, to consider the advisability of
practicing this term. As a result
(piite a number of men have signed
an agreement to go into prelimi
nary training. Light, practice will
take place three times a week, with
special attention to kicking and
catching.
The long - postponed baseball
game between the (ilee Club and
the Football Team really came off
last Saturday afternoon. One fea
ture of the game was the souvenir
score-card prepared by Manager
Farisli, which contained joshes and
caricatures of the players. Last
year the men of music won, but at
the end of Saturday's game the
score stood 11 to Sin favor of the
men of muscle.
Another good game of baseball
was played last Wednesday after
noon between the Freshmen and
Sophomores. Some excellent in
dividual playing on one side and
many errors ot: the other made the
score at the end of the game 25 to
17 in favor of the class of '9!).
The reception to Professor and
Mrs. Le Conte has been definitely
set for Thursday, February 18. A
large number of invitations have
been issued.
A new engineering society has
just been organized by the senior

goes by the name of the College of
Mechanics' Engineering Society.
The object is to give its members a
knowledge of practical engineering.
Meetings are to be held monthly, at
which addresses will be delivered
by engineers of note and papers
read by the students.
