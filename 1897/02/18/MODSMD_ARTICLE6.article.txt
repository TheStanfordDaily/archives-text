Editor ()aily Palo Alto:
There is considerable complaint
anuong the stockholders of the Co
op., and justly it seems to me,, re
garding the scheme of the present
board. The question is pertinent
as to why the $4000 stock which
the members have invested should
not he partly, at least, returned by
the proponed new organization. In
the circular letter sent out the
board claims that the Co-op. has
never been run on a paying basis.
It is true it has never paid the
members, but it may well be
doubted regarding the manager.
We have repeatedly heard the
cry that "some poor student must
have a job or he could not come
back to the University." When
the sameupoor ( ?) student who se
cured the position, has, before the
close of the year, worn diamonds
so large that the light reflected from
them has blinded and staggered the
members who voted him in, when
another candidate can afford to pur

j chase a large number, of shares in
order to insure his election as man
| ager, then one may reasonably ask
! if some scheme can not he devised
by which part of the stock invested
| can not. be refunded, since no divi
dend has been declared.
The board declares that if any
| scheme cau be advanced by which
justice can he done to the old mem
bers and still place the new organ
ization on a firm basis, they will
! gladly accept it. As a suggestion,
would not the following plan ac
complish that very object and at
the same time not ask a free-will
I offering from the old organization?
Let the new-born babe which
seeks to draw its life from the
present organization go about it as
j any other business corporation
would have to do. Let them issue
bunds for such an amount as seems
best, sell these and declare a per
centage in favor of the present
members. This may be done, per
haps, according to the proportional
time on which the slums were sold.
For instance, those more recently
buying should receive more than
those who purchased at the begin
ning. When recent purchasers of
shares were told that their shares
would be 'good for life, it was
i evidently, as Emerson says, at the
opposite pole of truth, now that
the board proposes to made the
| contract void.
The new organization could pro
vide fora graduated sinking fund
by which these bonds could be
paid. Surely the new business,
placed on a good basis and man
aged by an experienced business
man, could be prosperous enough
to hii}' its own stock on which to do
business, especially on a plan of
this kind. Everyone is in favor of
reform, for the present management
is rotten, but no one cares to give
all of a newly purchased share for
the benefit of a charity baby. Fur
ther arrangements ought to be pro
vided by which the Hoard of Di
rectors could not force assistants
upon the manager.
