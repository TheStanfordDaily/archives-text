# ENGINEERING JOURNAL.
## Published by the Associated Engineers of Stanford University. 
### 
The first number of the new
EiuiineeriiK) Journal, which is to be
published semi-annually by the
Associated Engineers, appeared
this afternoon.
The first article is from the pen
of Professor Frederic A. C. Perrine
and is entitled "A practical index
of engineering literature." The
system of card cataloguing ox
plained by Professor Perrine will
lie of great aid to engineers who de
sire to keep posted on the literature
of their profession.
The only other contribution
from the faculty is one from Pro
fessor C. I). Marx. This is a resume
of Riedler's paper on American
technical schools. Professor Marx
•does not attempt to criticise the ar
ticle, but summarizes tersely the
points considered by Riedler. These
points include number of schools,
entrance requirements, degrees,
cnst of equipment and instruction,
government, and methods of in
st ruction.
Much advice which will -be of
great use to those who will follow
engineering is given by Randell
Hunt in a paper on Engineering
Ethics. Mr. Hunt is a prominent
engineer of San Francisco who has
lectured here at different times and
is therefore well known to the stu
dents.
The rest of the Journ-il is com
posed of contributions from stu
dents. Chief among these is the
description of the construction ol
the sewer outfall at Ithaca, New
York, by Burns, '1)7. Mr. Burns
was formerly a student at Cornell,
and an assistant on the work, and
therefore had material at his dis
posal which enabled him to give a
concise account of the construction
of the outfall. 'The article is illus
trated by several photographs.
Besides this article Howard S.
Warren has a paper on the 'Trans
mission of Electrical Energy, in
which he considers the different
classes of problems which present
themselves in this connection.
In the article, "A method of pro
tracting," H. F. Blichfeldt, gr., ad
vances a new method in that line,
which can be used advantageously
by draftsmen.
Of the other two contributions,
one is from Kingsland, gr., on "Cut
ting lines of force, ' and the other
by A.(i. Kaufman, '97, entitled "A
practical explanation of mentally
finding the cube root of any perfect
cube."
In addition to these leading ar
ticles, which occupy over forty
pages, the last ten pages contain
much matter of local interest.
B. N. Young, '97, furnishes a ''De
scription of the power plant at
Stanford." 'The different Engineer
ing organizations are noted and
described. 'The ''Alumni Notes"
give the location of over forty grad
uates of the Engineering depart
ments.
The editorial page gives an out
line of the purpose and scope of the
besides giving the history
of the movement, which led to its
establishment.
The issue is neat in appearance,
securely bound in a cover of heavy
paper, and typographically is one

of the most creditable productions
of the University Press.
