It is the prerogative of the
Class of 1900 to establish tha
precedent of suppressing ilie an
nual rush between the freshman
and sophomore classes. This form
of controversy should have no
place in our University. Its per
nicious influence is felt not only by
the contestants but by the whole
community. The spectators derive
no pleasure from the scrimmage,
and the contestants receive their
reward in the way of wounds and
scars and the cultivation of brutal
instincts. It lowers the University
in public estimation, and the senti
ment of the whole body of students
should be against it. The faculty
lias expressed a desire to rely upon
the judgment and reason of the
students to suppress this brutal
form of amusement, and do not
wish to be compelled to take defi
nite action against it.
