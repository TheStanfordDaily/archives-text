Stanford has been peculiarly
fortunate this year in the choice of
coaches for her athletic teams that
have entered heart and soul into
their work of training the men in
their charge. Harry Cross could
not have been more deeply in
terested in the welfare of the foot
ball men than he was, and no one
was happier over the final victory
than he. The coaches at present

in charge of the track and baseball
men are imbued with the same
spirit of devotion to the Stanford
cause. Coach Lunge is untiring in
his efforts to develop the baseball
material at hand, and to make of
it the best team possible. Coach
King is equally active in the train
ing of the track athletes. Each is
working hard for the interests of
the Stanford athletes, and if we do
not win in baseball and track con
tests this year it will not be for
lack of efficient coaching.
