As noted in yesterday's issue,
the Berkeley committee has post
poned the selection of the question
for the Intercollegiate Debate. The
question should have been chosen
and submitted to the Stanford de
baters on Monday, and now an en
tire week will be lost out of tlie
time in which our men have to
prepare for the contest. It is im
possible to look upon this delay
without a feeling that we are being
imposed upon. Berkeley has not
yet held her preliminaries, and the
question which they select for the
Intercollegiate Debate will un
doubtedly be debated in the pre
liminary contests to choose the U. C.
representatives on the debate. Con
sequently the longer they are en
abled to keep the question to them
selves the greater will be their
advantage in preparing for the
contest. We make no formal com
plaint that the Berkeley committee
is pursuing such a course, but we
do ask for fair play, and that of the
plainest, commonest kind.
