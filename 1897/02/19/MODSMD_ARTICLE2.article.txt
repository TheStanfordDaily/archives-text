# Chapel Preacher.
## 
### 
The Rev. William Rader, who
preaches in the chapel next Sun
day, is pastor of the Third Congre
gational Church, San Francisco.
Mr. Rader is recognized as one of
the most energetic and progressive
young ministers on the Coast. He
is specially interested in the Chris
tian Endeavor movement and in
practical problems in sociology.
By a current series of sermons on
the higher criticism of the Old Tes
tament Mr. Rader is arousing con
siderable opposition in conserva
tive orthodox circles. His subject
for Sunday will be 'The Bible,"
and doubtless from the point of
the higher criticism.
