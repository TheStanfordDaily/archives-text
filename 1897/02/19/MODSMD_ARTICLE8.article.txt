# Faculty and Students
## 
### 
In the last number of the Occi
dent the editor of that magazine de
plores the tendency of the faculty
of the State University to keep
aloof from student affairs. The
writer compares this action with
that of the faculty of this Univer
sity with results greatly to the
credit ol our professors. The an
nual Faculty-Senior baseball game
is cited as an instance of the close
relation between students and teach
ers at Stanford; and the writer adds
that "such a game is totally out of
the question at Berkeley." To this
withdrawal of the faculty from the
''common student mob" the writer
of the article attributes in part the
lack of college spirit at the State
University.
