scene of gay festivities last Friday
night. This rude ami hare hall

rough walls were made to look like
new with their decorations of green
from the neighboring mountains.
The leaden-colored rafters were lost
sight of a hove the hunting of white
and yellow which radiated from
the center of the hall. From this
center there was suspended what

committee, had worked out several
very pretty figures, and it was he
