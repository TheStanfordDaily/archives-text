The question for the Intercol
legiate Debate has been received,
and our choice of sides vviil soon be
made. The question submitted,
however, is not stated in a very
definite manner, beingaeconipanied
with qualifying statements which
seem to controvert the mam text of
the question. Our debaters have
the right and should demand a
clearer and more exact statement
of the subject for debate. The qual
ifications should be embodied in the
question in such a way that confu
sion would not result in the minds
of the judges or debaters, and that
the debute would not be tilled with
quibbling over technicalities caused
by an uncertain wording of the
question.
