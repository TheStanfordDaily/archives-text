The hills for the relief of Stan
ford I'niversitv are encountering
strong and unexpected opposition
in the State Senate. The hill which
was introduced for the purpose of
allowing Mrs. Stanford to endow
the University with her entire es- 1
tate and the disposal hy will of the
entire property for non-sectarian
educational or charitable objects.

passed the Senate last Friday. Sen
ator Dwyer of San Francisco, how
ever, has given notice that he
would move for a reconsideration
of the measure. Senator Wolf op
poses the bill on account of the
non-sectarian clause.
The other bill introduced to ex
empt the University from taxation
has also encountered opposition.
An amendment offered, striking
out the words "conducted without
sectarian bias or control" was
voted down as it would have made
the bill unconstitutional. Senator
Morehouse of Santa Clara county
made an able and eloquent plea in
behalf of the bill. lie showed
how the bill, if passed, would
add at least $;>(),000 a year to
the University's income. lie paid
an eloquent tribute to Senator Stan
ford and held that Stanford was as
much a public institution as the
State University.
Senator liraunhart held that the
bill was unconstitutional. Senator
(lillett opposed the bill for similar
reasons and also urged the argu
ment that the bill would exempt
the Vina ranch from taxation and
throw the burdens of Tehama
county <>n the small taxpayers.
Senator Jones of Orange opposed
the bill on the grounds that it was
not a free school and announced
that it was not free to taxpayers
whose income was but one dollar a
day.
Eighteen senators oppose the bill
in its present form. The voles of
two niorfe will he sufficient to kill
it. Some object only to the pres
ent form of the bill. Some favor
the exemption of parochial schools j
likewise. Some favor only the ex
emption of the Palo Alto property.!
Others favor the distribution of the
losses of the counties by the ex
emption of the University over the
whole state. Yet others feel that
the University should be deeded to
the state and placed under state
management if it is to be exempted, j
The outlook is very dark, hut the!
supporters of the bill are active and
may win the day. The debate was |
assigned for tod a v.
