The disappearance of books from
the library that lias lately annoyed
us so much was partly explained
on Monday when a thorough over
hauling of the shelves was made.
Behind the rows of hooks on the
shelves were found many of the
books that were thought to have
been lost. They had evidently been
placed there by students in order
that they might be obtained when
ever wanted. Now that they have
been placed in proper position
again we should all realize the ne
cessity of making their use avail
able to the whole body of students.
In a library such as ours, where the
number of duplicate copies is neces
sarily limited, we should be careful
not to monopolize books which
other? might have occasion to use.
