rirk new athletic, agreement be
tween Stanford and the University
of California seems very satisfac
tory, and our representatives de
serve much credit for the part they
took in its formulation. We are
especially pleased that the pro
vision relating to the intercollegiate
hunt race has been amended. The
new clause covers the case, and
Stanford will not be criticised for her
inability to live up to the former
provision in the agreement. It was
also a wise plan to put the an
nual freslnnail football game on a

Bound basis by providing for its
(continuance. The thirty-day agree
ment relating to students entering
either university and desirous of
competing will do no harm to either
university. Students entering more
than thirty days from the begin,
ning of the semester are not ahle to
compete in athletics and carry their
university work satisfactorily. The
one thing unexpected was the strik
ing out of the provision relating to
the abolishing of Eastern coaches.
Taken altogether the new agree
ment is a very satisfactory one to
govern the athletic contests between
our teams and those across the bay.
