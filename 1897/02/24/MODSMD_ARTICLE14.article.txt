It is often a source of annoyance
to those who make announcements
through the columns of the Daily
Palo Ai.to to find that such notices
are not read by the persons for
whom they are intended. Much
confusion and waste of time are the
result of this neglect. So long as
one has to read through an entire
paper to make sure of finding all
the notices of meetings, lectures, ex
aminations, etc., in which one is
interested, there is some excuse for
an occasional failure of this kind.
To avoid this difficulty the new
plan of printing all the announce
ments in one place and heading
each one with a catch-line indicat
ing for whom it is intended was in
augurated at the beginning of this
semester. It should now be pos
sible for anyone to get the informa
tion he desires by taking the most
hurried glance down the column of
announcements. In addition to
this the schedule printed every day
should be a gentle reminder and
should certainly be given some at
tention. There are fourteen stu
dents of this I'Diversity who are on
the staff of this paper and their
work from day today in arranging
the news of the University in a con
venient and readable shape brings
them no reward or remuneration
except the satisfaction of rendering
a good service to their fellow-stu
denis. This work could be carried
on with more enthusiasm if it were
known that the rest of the students
here appreciated it enough to take
the time to look over this news with
a little care after it is collected.
