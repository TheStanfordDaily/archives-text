# The 						Game at Santa Cruz.
## 
### 
The encouraging feature of tlie
Santa Cruz game ou llie 22d was
Beckett's pitch ng. Barring a lit
tle nervousness lie did excellently,
striking out seven men and allow
ing hut two hits in the first live
innings; he was then taken out to
save his arm and McLaine pre
vented either hits or runs in the
remaining four innings. Stanford's
fielding was well enough, Strohn
and Lougheed making some good
plays, hut the team si ill lacks con
sistent hatting and hase-running.
The score:
STANFORD.
