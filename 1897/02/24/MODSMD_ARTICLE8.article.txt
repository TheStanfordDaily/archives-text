nieeting of Dr. W. A. Brooks, llar
-1 vard Hf>, and Walter Cam]), Vale
"(St), took place. Acting as the repre
sentatives of their respective col
leges, they drew up the formal
j agreement which insures a return
' to the series of athletic contests for
ja period of five years, and requires
that all events except rowing shal 1
| take place on college grounds. A
graduate committee is to be ap
pointed to arbitrate all disputes.

Ito be left to the managers and
I captains.
