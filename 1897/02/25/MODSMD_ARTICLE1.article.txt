# PLANS FOR CO-OPERATION
## The 						Social Science Club Makes a Study of Co-operative Associations. 
### 
'flie subject for discussion at the
meeting of the Social Science Club
last evening was 'College co-opera- j
tive societies.'' A committee of thei
club has been working on the sub- \
ject for some time and has gathered j
together much information relative
t«) the co-operative system in use at
o her colleges. This information
was formulated into a report and;
presented to the club, upon which I
discussion followed. Frank Adams.
'00, and H. W. Grunsky, '1)9, made
the report.
The Harvard Co-operative Asso
ciation is the most successful co-op.
in the United States. A member
ship fee of one dollar is charged,
which entitles the members to a
share in the profits at the close of
the year. Last year $(>,OOO wasdi
vided among the members, accord
ing to the amount of their pur
chases.
The University of Pennsylvania
has no student association but liasj
a plan whereby students are en-'
a bled to secure discounts from mer-1
chants in the city. Under this sys-1
tem students are given a discount
of from ten to twenty-five percent.,
and this extends not only to books
but to other supplies and clothing.
Chicago has no regularly organ
ized co-op. outside of the university
bookstore. Ann Arbor has none at
present.
Berkeley's co-op. was reported to
be in a flourishing condition. lis
manager is a student who employs
as many as six assistants at differ-1
ent times in the year.
The Stanford book store was |
started by a Mr. Merrill when the |
University opened. It was Mrs. I
Stanford's wish, however, that it j
should be operated by the students,!
and so Mr. Merrill solel out to the |
Co operative Association about one i
year after the opening of the Uni-i
versitv. The office of manager has
been held successively by Brown,
'92, Rich, '98, Magee, '1)5, Stowell,
'94, Newman, '95, and Barnett, '97,
the present incumbent.
Among the difficulties of the
present system is the fact that the
Co-op. is involved in college poli
tics. Whoever can get the greatest
number of proxies under his con
trol selects directors pledged to
himself for manager. Another
thing that is said to militate
against the Co-op. as at present or
ganized is that the association is a>
stock company and not suited to
the needs of the student body. The |
yearly change of management is
unfortunate; one manager is!
scarcely able to become familiar
with the workings of the business j
before he has to give wav to a new ;
one. The new manager does not I
know what books to buy or how
many, and the shelves as a conse
quence become stacked with unsal
able books, necessitating a higher
charge on new purchases. The fact i
that there are two prices in our
Co-op. makes the business purely j
local. Prof. Howard thinks there
is no reason why our Co-op. should
not supply outlying towns, even be
coming, in some things at least, a
wholesale house for San Jose. As
it is the Kastern dealers have not

sufficient confidence in our student
managers, and even when hooks
are ordered direct from the Eastern
publishers the Co-op. lias to pay
the San Francisco wholesale deal
ers a commission.
Professors Powers and Marx were
reported as heing in favor of a per
manent qualified outsider heing
chosen to hold offce. Profes
sor Ross is in favor of the
plan outlined in yesterday's issue,
I hat of having members of the fac
ulty take charge of the association
and operate it under a manager
who is not a student in the Uni
versity.
