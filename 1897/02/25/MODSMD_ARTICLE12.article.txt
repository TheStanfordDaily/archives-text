The present system by which
syllabi are supplied to classes is
weak in the fact that the contract
for printing them was made sev
eral years ago and there has been
no competition. The print is poor
and there are only a few copies
used during the year, for which the
students have to pay a fee of one
dollar in each course. There is
room for improvement in the sys
tem, and open competition would
seem to be the best way in which to
bring it about.
