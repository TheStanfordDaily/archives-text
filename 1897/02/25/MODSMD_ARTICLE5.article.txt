# SOPHOMORES WERE BEATEN
## Second of the Series of Inter-Class Contests Won by the Freshmen. 
### 
Six innings served to annihilate
Ihe Sophomores in yesterday's
game with the Freshmen, and the
excitement sure to result when '00
crosses bats with '98 in the finals
Tuesday should go far towards
paying Coach Lunge's expenses.
Neither side did much of any
thing until the fifth inning, when
'00 scored five times, '99 following
with a gain of six. The Freshmen
went around the batting order
three times in the next inning fora
total of seventeen, and the Sopho
mores then gave up the struggle.
Lougheed, Strolln, Murphy, and
Lanagan were 'OO's best men.
Beckett did not do himself justice
in the box. Lougheed and Strohn
should be able to repeat their fast
base-running in Saturday's game
in San Francisco with the Piute
India lis.
