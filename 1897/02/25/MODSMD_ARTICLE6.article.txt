### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto: The
past few days have proved an im
portant week for Berkeley. ('lose
on the success <>112 the Carnot Debate
hiis come the unanimous passage of
the Wright appropriation hill. For
us this is a victory long to he re
membered. At last our university
can make that advance and im
provement which its natural growth
and the growth of the state have so
long demanded. Naturally there
was great rejoicing when the news
reached Berkeley, hut that will be
nothing to the enthusiasm and joy
that will be let loose next Fridayâ€”
our day of jubilation. Then with
all work suspended, a military re
view, music, and speeches we will
fittingly celebrate California's new
em of prosperity.
The Le Conte reception at the
Mark Hopkins Institute on Thurs
day evening was a great success. In
spite of the rain the Institute was
crowded by friends of the univer
sity. The university (ilee Club ren
dered several selections, and later
President Kellogg, in a short and
appropriate speech, presented the

testimonial. Addresses were then
made by "I'rofess >r .Joe" and Gov
ernor liudd.
The class games in baseball are
now ended. On Wednesday last
the Junior nine won a hotly eon
tested game from the Sophomores,
and so yesterday the Juniors and
the Dental College played for tlie
inter-elass trophy. The game was
one of the best this season, and
though lhe Dentists were expected
to have an easy walk-over, the
score by the ninth inning pro
claimed the Junior team tlie inter
class champions.
On Friday last the (* lee, Mando
lin, and Hun jo Clubs went to Stock
ton, where they gave quite a suc
cessful concert. The theater was
crowded and the numbers well re
ceived.
The library has this past week
received another valuable gift.
Louis Sloss, the prominent San
Francisco merchant, has presented
to the university a Semitic and He
brew library of over three thousand
volumes. This fine acquisition, in
addition to the Cireenhaum collec
tion recently presented, constitutes
the largest collection of works in
Hebrew extant.
