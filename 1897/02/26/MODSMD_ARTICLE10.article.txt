# STANFORD THE NEGATIVE.
## Our Debaters Will Oppose Cabinet Representation. 
### 
It was decided this afternoi n
that the Stanford debaters should j
take the negative side of the ques- j
tion submitted by Berkeley for the
Intercollegiate Debate. The Berke
ley debaters will be informed of I
this action tonight.
The debate will probably take
place about the middle of April.!
The question is being discussed at!
Berkeley this week by the debating]
students in general, and the pre
liminaries to select the University I
of California representatives will be]
held in about two weeks.
The question for the debate is as!
follows: "Resolved, That each mem
ber of the Cabinet should have a
seat and voice in Congress By the
'Cabinet'we mean, of course, the]
Secretaries of State, War, Navy, |
Treasury, Interior, and Agriculture,
the Rostmaeter-Ceneral, and the i
Attorney-General. 'Seat and voice' |
are not to be construed to mean j
possessing a vote, but to mean that!
Cabinet members may, on being
summoned or voluntarily, speak
upon the floor of either house."
