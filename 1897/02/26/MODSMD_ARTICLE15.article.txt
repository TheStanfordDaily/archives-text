Certain tendencies during the
past week show that there is a
sharp rivalry between the Senior
Vaudeville Committee and the
management of "She Stoops to Con
quer." There is opportunity for
both of these entertainments to be
presented at times when the ven
tures will result profitably to the
promoters. This success can not
be attained, however, if constant
bickering and strife be carried on
by both parties. On the contrary,
harmonious action in the matter
will in the end prove to be the best
policy.
