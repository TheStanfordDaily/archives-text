Gentlemen of the If. C. Boating
Association, we have something to
say to you. For the past two
months you have been trying to
force Stanford into a boat race, and
not content with sane arguments
on the matter, and not satisfied
with the explanation of our inabil
ity to make the agreement, you
have departed from the fields of
simple persuasion and have gone
out of your way to criticise lis in
terms that are insulting and un
deserved. You charge us with in
sincerity and imply that Stanford
would not meet Berkeley on the
water if she could. You say:
"But ihe solid, tangible fact re
mains that in 189 Stanford made
effective preparation for the Col
umbian Regatta, that a sum of $800
was donated by Senator Stanford
fora racing shell. Then, and then
only, was it that, in the face of
these warlike preparations, we took
measures for defense, founded a
Boat Club, and trained a crew.
When, after breathless preparation,
we sallied out to meet the foe, we
found that, silently, like the Arabs,
etc. ; that the Stanford crew, boat,
the possibilities of a race, had van
ished like a mirage, in 1892 it was
possible to send a crew to the Col
umbian Regatta; in 1897 it is im
possible to meet a crew with 'in
glorious record,' as they call it.it
is truly deplorable that geological
changes should be so rapid at Palo
Alto; that in five years alluvial de
posits should fill up a lake and
convert a bay into a mud fiat. We
acknowledge we were not aware
that Stanford University is built
upon quicksand."
This is all the foundation there
is in the case which you think you

have against us; the mere fact that
Stanford talked of entering tlie Co
lumbian Regatta and made some
plans in that direction, which were
speedily dropped when we discov-j
ered how great were the disadvan-;
tages with which we had to deal.j
We were not "scared out," nor have
we ever seen the time when we were
afraid to match our men of muscle
against any that Berkeley could
produce. We can play football
first-rate, and if we had a place to
train we might possibly be able to
get a crew in shape to row. And
no one desires this more than we
do; we regret exceedingly our in
ability to enter a crew, and have
said so before.
Now then, let there be an end to
this fuss and splutter. If the Uni
versity of California Boat Club can
not maintain its existence without
a Stanford crew to back it up it
had better call quits and give up
the ghost. We will row when we
can, but in the meantime let us de
vote our attention to the contests
that are already scheduled, and if
our athletic enthusiasm can not
find sufficient outlet in these direc
tions, then we will devise some
means of tapping Berkeley's over
supply.
We have nothing more to say on
the matter of rowing. We want to
hear nothing more from you. Talk
to the galleries if you want to, but
we will not listen.
