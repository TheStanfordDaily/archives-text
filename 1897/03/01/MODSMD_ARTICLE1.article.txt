# TO IMPROVE THE CO-OP.
## Stockholders Meet to Consider Plans of Reorganization. 
### 
President Farmer called to order i
a meeting of about sixty members
of the Co-op. at 2 p.m. today inj
room 50. After the reading of the
minutes of the meeting bed last l
May, Prof. Green was called upon I
to give a report he had made on the i
condition of the Co-op.
lie reported $138500 worth ofj
salable stock on the shelves of the j
Co-op., $1200.00 worth of unsalable j
material, and $500.00 in stationery, I
etc. He made $000 as the estimate
for which the old stock by judicious
procedure could be gotten rid of, j
but he was unable to state author- j
itatively just what could be gotten '
for it. The liabilities are $1304 less :
$280, cash on hand, or $1024. lie
outlined a plan by which he be-!
fieved a co-op. could be kept alive!
here. The shares were to be $1 00
each. A provision was to he made
precluding all possible chance of
gain by the shareholders and giv
ing the profits of the association to I
the students and professors of the j
University in the shape of reduced
prices. It was not, expected that
many students would wish to sub
scribe to the stock of the company,
but twenty or thirty professors,
enough to carry the project through,
would see that the new organiza
tion was a success. This new com
pany purposed selling to the new
organization the stock now on hand
for the present association, charging
a commission large enough tocover
the cost of handling the goods.
After some parley concerning dis
solution it was found that nothing
could be done unless two thirds of
the shares of the present Co-op 1
were represented, A count by Prof. \
Brum Prof. Marx, and Painter,'9B,
showed that only 14(> shares were i
represented. As 44(> shares were
needed, the meeting could do noth
ing and an adjournment was taken. 1
After ihe adjournment of the i
meeting of the members of the (Jo
operative Association those present
effected an organization with C. A
Walker,'9B. in the chair. A mo
tion was made and carried request
ing the president ot the student j
body to appoint a committee to re-1
reive plans for the reorganization of
the Co-op and to call a mass meet
ing of the student body to consider j
and vote upon the plans proposed |
The purpose of the motion was to |
get an expression of the sentiment
of the whole student body on the
proposed plans.
Prof Brun made a motion, which '
carried, providing that a committee j
of three be apnointed by the chair
t<i report plans by which the asso-1
ciation could be dissolved without,
a two-thirds vote of all the stock-;
holders. The meeting then ad-1
journed.
