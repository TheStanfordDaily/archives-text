Thb courtesy extended to Stan
ford students by the people of Red
wood City last Saturday night on
the occasion of the musical clubs'
concert calls for recognition on our
part. Thanks are especially due
to the newspapers for their free ad
vertisement of the concert, and to
the school authorities for their
donation of the auditorium in
which the concert was held. We
hope it may sometime be our privi
lege to more fully requite the hos
pitality shown us.
