Thk new life recently instilled
into the Stanford Press Clnl) brings
into the foreground an organiza
tion which lias abundant opportu
nities for work in a field which has
hitherto been neglected. The lec
ture given a few nights ago by Mr.
Bonner calls attention to an in
teresting line of work the Press
Club might undertake. Although
there are probably not tnany per
s mis here who intend to make a
prolession of journalism, there are
112 â–  w people in this day who do not
take a lively interest in the modern
.1 per and magazine and in
the men who ma kr a sfKvi.i Ify-ot

literary work. To gratify the de
sire for knowledge of newspaper
methods on the part of the general
community, as well as to furnish
valuable ideas and suggestions to
our journalists-to-be, the Press Club
should be encouraged to repeat its
recent experiment and secure other
lecturers whenever possible.
