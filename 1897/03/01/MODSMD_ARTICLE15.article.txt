An illustration of the far-sighted
ness and faithfulness which has
characterized the entire adminis
tration of our finances by our present
student body treasurer is found in the
report just published of the profits
from this year's football souvenir.
It has always been the custom
heretofore for each university to
sell to some outside party its share
in the right to publish the souvenir.
Berkeley followed the same plan tliii
year and our Executive Committee
would doubtless ha vedone so too had
not Mr. Morrison volunteered to as
sume the responsibility for super
intending Stanford's part in the
publication so that all the profits
might be turned into our treasury.
The result lias been that more than
four times as much as has ever
been realized from this source be
fore will be added to our student
body funds. All praise is due to
Treasurer Morrison for this and
many other similar acts. We
think it but just that so faithful a
service as his should receive proper
recognition.
