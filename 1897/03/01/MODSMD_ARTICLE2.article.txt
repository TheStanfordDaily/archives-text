# Stanford Wins from the Piutes.
## 
### 
The game in San Francisco Sat-;
urdsiy with (lie I'iute Indians, plus J
McCartj' and Mertes, served hut to j
demonstrate again .Stanford's weak -1
ness at the bat. Wight and|
Clematis each had hits cut off hy j
inlielders out of position, hut this
was fully offset hy the fact that two
of the scored hits were scratches.
Sixteen errors hv the Indians tells
the story of the game. Sharp gave

a miserable exhibition of hatting,
and Freeman did not break his re
cord of no safe hits in practise or
Varsity games. Criticism of this
point can not he extended without
seeming too hard on the players
who are trying their best, but im
provement is absolutely necessary.
[Stanford's tiehling was good, with
the exception of Sharp's three er
rors. Beckett pitched a fair game,
but has not learned control of his
high ball. The score:
STANFORD.
