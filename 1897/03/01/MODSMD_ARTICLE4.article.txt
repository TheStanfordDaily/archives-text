# SUCCESSFUL CONCERTS.
## The 						Stanford Musical Clubs Appear Before Large Houses. 
### 
The (ilee and Mandolin Clubs
appeared in San .Jose Friday night
before a fair sized audience. The
clubs, although not in as good
condition as they were for the re
cent charity concert in San Fran
cisco, made an excellent impression.
The San .Jose Mercury has the fol
lowing to say: "The concert sing
ing by the (ilee Club was excellent.
The Mandolin Club showed careful
training and great skill in render
ing difficult and pleasing selections.
The impersonations of Coster and
Bowery singers by Mr. Dillon were
cleverly executed, and when he
sang the negro ditty 'Lulu Loo,'
the audience gave him enthusiastic
applause. Mr. Riley's monologues
were excellent pieces of comedy act
ing and were well received."
The concert in Redwood Satur
day evening was a marked im
provement on the one given the
evening before. This may he ac
counted for partially by the larger
and more enthusiastic house and
partially by the superior acoustics
of the hall in Redwood. The Banjo
Club made its first public appear
ance at this concert and acquitted
itself very creditably. The (ilee
Club sang with its accustomed
vivacity, and received an enthusi
astic welcome each time it ap
peared. The Mandolin Club made
the musical hit of the evening,
playing several pieces better than
ever before, and eliciting the warm
est words of praise. Mr. Riley has
never appeared to better advantage,
several of his pieces being abso
lutely faultless.
Financially both concerts were a
success. Since the beginning of
the semester the clubs have taken
in more than $500, and before the
end of the college year all debts
will doubtless be paid and several
hundred dollars besides will be
put to the clubs' credit. The next
concerts are Tuesday evening in
San Mateo, and March 14 in Santa
Cruz.
