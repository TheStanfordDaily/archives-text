Seniors are requested to notice
that the class assessment is due
and now payable. It is extremely
urgent that members of the class
should pay their assessment as soon
as possible. The Commencement
Week Committee can do nothing un
til it has some guarantee of the
amount that will he available, and
there is no better way to aid the
committee in the work which it has
to do than to pay the assessment at
once.
