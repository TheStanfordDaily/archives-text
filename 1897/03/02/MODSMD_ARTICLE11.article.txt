The announcement made by the
editorial board of the Junior An
nual in another column deserves
rest ding and attention from those
concerned. Unless the records of
the Senior Class, the fraternity
lists, and the membership rolls of
organizations are received by the
Annual Board by the date specified,
the publication may be seriously
delayed. A compliance with this
request would not be irksome,
while it would greatly facilitate the
work of the editors.
