# Regulation of Attendance.
## 
### 
The Princeton faculty has
adopted new regulations in regard
to absences and cuts, which re
cently went into effect. The former
system of regulating absences
proved very defective, and the new
plan is designed to accomplish
some reform.
According to the new system a
faculty committee on attendance
is constituted, which is to have
charge of all questions concerning
attendance on chapel and class ex
ercises. Excuses are not to be
granted except in extraordinary
cases. Excuses are to be made in
person and not later than the
second meeting of the committee
after the absence occured.
Every undergraduate student is
required to attend morning chapel
exercises and the services on Hun
day, unless excused by the presi
dent or faculty. If the absences of
any student in any quarter of the
university year exceed a certain
number (eighteen for seniors and
juniors, fourteen for sophomores,
freshmen, and specials) he becomes
liable to a penalty, which in ordi
nary cases is suspension. The com
mittee may, however, impose other

penalties as they see fit. If the stu
dent's absences do not come within
the fixed limit, the difference, un
less it should exceed six, is added
to the number of times he may cut
in the next quarter.
Every undergraduate is requested
also to attend the scheduled exer
cises of his class. If the absences
of a student from class work in any
quarter exceed ten for seniors and
juniors and eight for sophomores,
freshmen, and specials, he becomes
liable to discipline, which ordina
rily is the imposition of extra work,
although the committee on attend
ance may impose other penalties.
An instructor may also punish ab
sences by imposing extra work, and
if the number is excessive may de
bar the student from the regular
examination. Such a student is
regarded as conditioned in the sub
ject.
Absences incurred on trips of the
musical clubs, with the permission
of the faculty, are excused on re
commendation of the music com
mittee. Absences incurred on trips
of athletic teams in connection
with intercollegiate games are ex
cused upon recommendation of the
faculty committee on outdoor sports.
