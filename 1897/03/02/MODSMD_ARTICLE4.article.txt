# THE
						CO-OP. AGAIN.
## The
						Much-Mooted Question of Reorganizing Our Book Store. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto: On
February 17 I received a letter sent
from the Co-op. which said in sub
stance:
"We, directors of the Co-opera
tive Association, wish to propose
changes which must be brought
about in some way.
"The only way to get rid of the
association is by a two-thirds vote
of the capital stock to disincorpo
rate. This is what we directors ex
pect to do, and you are requested
io send your share of stock and
your proxy to us.
'"The store has never been run to
make si profit. We propose to give
all the books on hand to a new as
sociation.
"The meeting is March 1. Please
send in your share and proxy."
I asked an experienced man
what kind of a scheme he
called that. "It is a bluff," lie said,
"to take in the stock, and many
freshmen will be taken in. They
will not think that they might
go to this meeting without
giving up their stock, nor that they
might be their own proxies."
1 did not approve what this man
said, but I decided to be my own
proxy. When I arrived at the
meeting March 1 they showed on
the blackboard that the Co op. has
on hand about $1200 worth of
books they may not sell for two
years, and so called "dead stock";
also about $1500 in "live stock";
also $500 in stationery, which they
added under the "dead stock." The
liabilities were said to be about
$1000. It was proposed to organ
ize a new company to which any
one might belong who wanted
to pay one dollar and be
come responsible for all debts of the
company, but receive no other ben-
Hit.
Then someone said we had met
to vote our organization out of
existence, and to consider who
should get the assets; and that we
would first proceed to vote our
selves out of existence, and then
see what would become of the as
sets afterward. Jt was found, how
ever, that there were not enough
proxies present to make the vote
legal, whereupon someone proposed
to vote ourselves out whether it was
legal or not. Another showed that
it would look better to go into vol
untary bankruptcy or find some
other way to snow ourselves under,
if the majority of the stockholders
still persisted in not sending in
.their proxies. A motion was then
carried providing that our young
lawyers should tax their ingenuity
to assist the stockholders to disin
corporate in spite of themselves.
Now 1 ask, is such a course quite
becoming to us? Is it for the wel
fare of the greatest number? Can
not we be honest enough to offer
our stockholders either their right
ful portion of the assets, or else
shares in a, new company in which
the)' may realize some return in
dividends? A Member.
