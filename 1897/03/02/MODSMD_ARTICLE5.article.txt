### 
At the peace meeting recently
held in Baltimore for the purpose

of adopting resolutions calling
upon the Senate to take definite
action toward ratifying the arbitra
tion treaty between this country
and Great Britain, President Pat
ton of Princeton said: "The time
has come when there must be peace
between these two great countries
and when we shall say that the
last drop of blood has been spilled
in war. If any nations are ready
for arbitration it must be these two
Anglo-Saxon peoples, who have the
same tongue and literature, the
same laws and interests. With in
ternational arbitration they will be
able to combine and take under
their control the destinies of the
world. It is not a part of civiliza
tion, of self-interest, and of Chris
tianity to keep alive animosities
between these cousins of one blood.
Let us put out our hand to those of
our family across the sea and say
there shall never more be even a
rumor of war between us."
