Mrs. A. W. Malton, Miss Mary
R. Ilex, Miss A. G. Stevenson, Mr.
Henry Harnett, Mr. Harry N. Bar
nett, and Mrs. Henry Gansert, of
Philadelphia; Mr. and Mrs. G. M.
Sandt and Mrs. Susan Devin, of
New York; Misses Maude and
Anna Brody, of Harrisburg, Pa.;
Mr. John Patterson, of Pittsburg;
and W. N. Burchard, of the Penn
sylvania R. It. Co., were visitors at
the University this morning.
The San Francisco Examiner this
morning reviews at length an arti
cle on the street-railroad problem
contributed to the Merchants' Asso
ciation Review by Professor E. A.
Ross. Dr. Ross believes this prob
lem can not be solved without
some experiments in city owner
ship, and the Examiner concludes
that "when such ideas as this can
come from a University founded
and maintained by railroad money,
there is encouragement to hope for
the ultimate solution of our trans
portation problems."
