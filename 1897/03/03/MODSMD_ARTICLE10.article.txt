It is with extreme regret that we
chronicle the suspension of the
Berkeleyan, published at the Univer
sity of California. We hope that
the effort to reorganize the com
pany may he successful and that
the Berkeleyan may continue to he
what it has heen in the past, a,
worthy representative of the noble
Fourth Estate.
