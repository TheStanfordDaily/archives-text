The coach and captain of the
baseball team have had reason to
complain because of the lack of
attendance at practise. Some of the
old players have been seen on the
diamond only a few times this
season, and the tardiness of the new
men is a thing that has never be
fore been seen on the campus. The
Varsity nine is not strong enough
as vet to disregard the warning of
Coach Lange that the team is not
in any form to win from Berkeley.
It is a well-known fact that the
team is very weak at the bat. It
is not fielders that we need but bat
ters. There are several vacancies
on the team which must be filled
from the second team. The Var

sity can not perfect its batting un
less there in a second team to play
against. Anyone who has played
the national game or can play it
should take note of the warning
sounded by such men as Lange
and Harrelson, that Berkeley has
a winning team and that our best
effort must be put forward to hold
the championship which has al
ways been ours. Play ball.
