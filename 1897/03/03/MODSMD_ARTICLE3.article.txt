Editor Daily Palo Alto: Last
Saturday was a great day for ihe
University of California. Owing
to the inability of the legislators to
be present Friday, our celebration
was postponed one day. All work
was suspended and when at noon
the Governor, regents, and legisla
tors arrived on a special train from
Sacramento, seventeen cannon shot
told all in hearing that the c.ele
bration had begun. The two bat
talions of cadets made a fine show
ing as they escorted the honored
delegation to Stiles Hall, where
lunch was served.
As soon as the Governor had
somewhat appeased his appetite,
the grand military review began,
after which all hastened to the
grandstand near the baseball dia
mond, where seats had been erected.
President Kellogg, who acted as
president of the day, first intro
duced Arthur Elston who, on be
half of the students, warmly wel
comed our visitors. The faculty
was represented in a few remarks
by Prof. Wm. Carey Jones, and the
alumni by its president, Win. R.
Davis. Regent Reinstein was fol
lowed by Assemblyman Wright
and Senator Stratton, who told the
history of the bill at Sacramento.
Governor Budd spoke of his con
nection with the University in the
past and present, and after Super
intendant Black, our Prof. "Joe"
closed Ihe speech-making with a
few words on the relation of poli
tics to state institutions.
It was a matter of but a few mo
ments to clear the diamond of all
benches and seats and to begin the
contest between the Varsity and the
Olympic nines. The game was a
good one, and it was highly fitting
that on such an occasion and before
such a crowd the score should stand
as it did in favor of the University
of California.
Many who had enjoyed the after
noon's celebration finished the day
in true university style by spending
the evening at the new "In Kokopo,"
presented by university talent at

the Macdonough Theatre in Oak
land. The play being full of new
features brought to a pleasant con
clusion our great day of celebra
tion.
Last Wednesday the Varsity
nine won an easy victory from
Belmont. Our team showed up in
tine form, considering that it was
the first game of the season.
The chess tournament has al
ready extended over the greater
part of the week, and will conclude
soon in a game between De La
guna and Epstein for the cham
pionship. BE KK RLEYA N.
