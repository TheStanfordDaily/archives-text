# STANFORD BILL DEFEATED.
## State Senate Refuses to Relieve the University From Taxation. 
### 
The l)ill to exempt Stanford Uni
versity from taxation was defeated
yesterday in the State Senate at
Sacramento. Almost all forenoon
was given up to the discussion of
the proposed measure.
Stratton spoke in support of the
hill. He maintained that Stan
ford University ought to he con
sidered among the public schools of
California and should have the
same privileges as the State Uni
versity at Berkeley.
The attack on the bill was led by
Simpson. He said that whether
Stanford University was exempt
from taxation or not, the Legisla
ture had no authority to change
its condition.
Withington expressed himself as
being in favor of relieving the in
stitution from taxation.
Dickinson said the bill was un
constitutional. The fact that the
University is under private con
trol was sufficient to make the bill
conflict with the Constitution.
Boyce contended that the constitu
tionality of the bill was a false
issue.
The vote on the bill was '25 to 14,
as follows:
Ayes —Andrews, Aram, Beard,
Bert, Boyce, Denison, Franck,
Langford, Morehouse, I'edlar, Brisk,
Stratton, Voorhies, Withington.
Noes —Braunhart, Bulla, Chap
man, Dickinson, Doty, Dwyer,
Feeney, Gillette, Gleaves, Hall,
Henderson, Holloway, Jones, La
Rue, hinder, Luchsinger. Mahoney,
Seawell, Shine, Shippee, Simpson,
Smith, Toner, Trout, Wolfe.
Flint declined t*o vote.
Concerning the defeat of the Stan
ford bill the San Francisco Chron
icle says this morning editorially
that ''the defeat of the bill exempt
ing Stanford University from taxa
tion may be justified on technical
grounds, but people who believe
that educational institutions en
dowed by private munificence help
to relieve the general taxpayer of
part of his burdens, will not think
it good public policy to discourage
similar endowments To all intents
and purposes Stanford Universtty
is a public institution, although it
may not come within the definition
which the Constitution furnishes.
But that is a matter which might
have been left to the courts, and
would have been had the Legisla
ture been desirous of helping the
cause of education."
