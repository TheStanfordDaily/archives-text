the students of the University ex
cept a chance to make lip hack
work and square themselves for the
closing months of the semester.
Few of them ever make a vacation
of the week, unless a change from
daily class routine to six days of
solid library or laboratory work he
regarded as such. Jt would he ex
ceedingly unwise not to grant the
students this week however precious
this time may he compared toother
weeks of the year. Throughout the
ten days of the Easter recess
students neither rest nor play —
they work in dead earnest. That
is all the vacation means to them.
