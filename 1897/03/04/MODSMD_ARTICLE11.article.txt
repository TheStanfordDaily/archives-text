While lamenting the defeat of
the Stanford bill in-theState Legis
lature we should not forget that the
University has many friends in
that body to whom we owe our
heartfelt thanks. The support
which they gave was not able to
oveicome the indifferent opposition
which took possession of their col
leagues as soon as the question of
constitutionality was raised. This
is an effective and oft-tried method
of killing any bill of public con
cern, and the fact that it was used
in the present instance need not
weaken our faith in the inherent
and ultimate justice of the cause of
the University.
