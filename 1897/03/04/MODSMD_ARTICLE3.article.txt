# A 						New Plan.

### 
The following plan for Co-op. re
organization has been originated
by a number of students who are

interested in improving the system.
It is published entire:
The frantic efforts of the direct
ors of the Co-operative Association
to reform that institution are per
haps justified by the faults of the
present system. But that reform
lies in the way of deliberate appro
priation, without equivalent, of the
stock of several thousand dollars
paid for by the students is hardly
conceivable. In the circular to
members and in the recent meeting
the directors have had no definite
scheme beyond reference to a cer
tain doubtful statute, under which
some members of the faculty will
assume permanent control, without
reference to business ability. In
the period of disincorporation fol
lowing the program of the directors
the control of the present stock
holders will vanish along with their
stock. The justice of this is hard
to see.
What is required is a scheme
that combines the greatest reform
with the l ights of the present stock
holders. Such a scheme is out
lined below. Let the stockholders
vote to adopt it before they are per
suaded to vote to disorganize.
1. Incorporate with a capital
stock of $1,000 in four hundred
shares, and give the present stock
holders equivalent stock in the new
company for their stock in the old,
but allow no one person to hold
more than two shares. It it should
happen that any person holds more
than two shares :;t present, redeem
his stock at its u1! value.
'2. Engage the services of a per
manent, reliable business manager,
who shall devote \\\> \\ hole time to
the interests of the stockholders,
and pay him a salary of $1,000 a
yea r.
3. Members of the faculty shall
be eligible as directors at the desire
of the stockholders, hut the direc
tion of the company shall not be
taken out of the hands of the stu
dents by taking the majority of the
directors from the faculty.
4. The directors sha 11 secure the
greatest discount on the goods pur
chased for the com pa nv, and shall
fix the price on the sales so that it
shall he lower than the regular re
tail price elsewhere.
5. At the end of the college year
the profits shall be divided among
the stockholders in the form of div
idends, either in proportion to the
amount of stock each shareholder
has in his possession and the length
of time not exceeding one year his
money has been invested, or in pro
portion to the amount of money the
stockholder has paid for books
bought of the company. If this
system be followed, whenever a
stockholder purchases he will call
out the number of his share, and
the amount of his purchase will be
recorded on bis account.
6. Redeem the shares of gradu
ates and those leaving the Univer
sity at the end of each college year.
It is believed that the system here
set forth is fair to all concerned,
and will be found practicable and
beneficial.
