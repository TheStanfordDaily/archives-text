# "SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER."
## The 						Comedy Which Sword and Sandals Will Put upon the Stage. 
### 
J n view of the forthcoming per
formance of"She Stoops to Conquer"
by the local dramatic clul>, a word
or two regarding that epoch-mak
ing play may he of interest at this
time.
The comedy, Goldsmith's second
serious dramatic work, "The Good
natured Man,'' having proven a
failure, was produced for the lirst
time at Covent Garden Theatre in
1773. At this time sentimental
comedy was the fashion in plays,
and this rollicking comedy, the fa
ther of modern farce comedy, went
through the hands of many man
agers before it obtained a hearing.
Once before the public, however, it
made a great hit and caused the
utter downfall of the sentimental
comedy. The play had an almost
continual run of two years and
held the English stage for two gen
erations. Excepting "The Rivals"
and " The School for Scandal" it is
the only English play of the eight
eenth century which is generally
acted to # day.
The main situation is simple and
effective. Marlowe and Hastings
are coming down to the house of
Hardeastle, a gentleman of the old
school, for the purpose of paying
court to his daughter and niece
respectively. On the way they are
met by Tony Lumpkin, Hard
castle's stepson and the joker of the
play, who persuades them that they
are far out of their course, and
sends them to his father's house as
an inn. Arriving thither the
young gentlemen treat the Hard
castles as inn-keepers, to the great
amazement of the family.
Marlowe is noted for his bashful
ness in the presence of refined wo
men, although he is not averse to
an occasional flirtation with a
milk-maid or a bar-maid Despair
ing of ever capturing him in pro
pria persona, Miss Hardeastle, hav
ing discovered his mistake, imper
sonates the bar-maid of the "inn"
and at last "lands" him. The plot
is further complicated bv the love
affairs of Hastings and Miss Nev
ille and by Tony's practical jokes
on all parties concerned.
One serious objection which has
been urged against the present per
formance is the temerity of Stan
ford amateurs in attempting a clas
sic whose parts have been acted by
such artists as Garriek, Booth, .Jef
ferson, Langtry, and Rehan. "She
Stoops to Conquer" is. however, a
comparatively easy play to act, its
plot, characterization, and wit
being of the lightest description.
Moreover, it happens tint the
range of parts is exactly suited to
dramatic talent now in the Uni
versity. These considerations in
duced our amateurs to make the
attempt, and good judges who have
seen the later rehearsals predict
success. The play will be pro
duced as nearly as possible in its
original form and without any of
the cutting and changing to which
it is submitted on the professional
stage, it will be correctly staged
and costumed.
