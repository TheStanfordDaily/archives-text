# Vassar Girls Rebel.

### 
The most emphatic demonstra-

tion of dissatisfaction with college
rules which was ever made by the
students of Vassar took place at
the college on Washington's Birth
day. Two years ago the faculty of
Vassar College voted that for vari
ous reasons Washington's Birthday
should not be given to the students
as a holiday. In 18 ( J(J the holiday
fell upon the last day of the week
and so seemed like a holiday in
many respects. But this year
brought it on Monday, and the
Vassar students thought it an in
sult to their patriotism to be
obliged to attend classes. So they
resolved to protest against this in a
body.
About a quarter of an hour be
fore breakfast Monday, a body of
students assembled at the senior
parlor and marched through the
corridors, increasing in numbers as
they proceeded. "America"and
"Yankee Doodle" were sung with a
will. By the time the procession
passed out the front entrance and
over to the president's house, there
were about 800 students in line.
They saluted President Taylor's
residence with "Three cheers for
the Red, White, and Blue" and
hearty cheers for George Washing
ton.
Then, returning, they entered
the dining-room to the tune of
"America." Quick and silent
hands had transformed the dining
room into a beautiful scene of na
tional colors. A chalk line was
drawn around the faculty table
and a screen of Hags shut them
away from the patriotic ones who
were intent upon celebrating the
day.
The professors were greeted, as
they entered theclassrooms, with pa-
Iriotic songs and their classes were
all arrayed in their best dresses, with
hats and gloves on, as it" just ready
to leave college. More than this, a
poster for every class was conspicu
ous behind the desk. The French
poster announced, "Qui entre ici le
patrioti.xme dehors." The algebra
one was a clever computation of the
results of taking away patriotism
from the faculty and adding it to
the students. The Greek one in*
formed the college that the Greeks
loved freedom and were taught to
honor those who freed their coun
try: "Would that our teachers
would do the same." The psychol
ogy poster traced the agonies of the
mind caused by depriving the stu
dent hotly of the holiday.
In the morning mail each mem
ber of the faculty received a notice
"A revised edition of Shakspere's
tragedy,'(Jeorge Washington.' " The
bulletin hoard in the main corri
dor was covered with notices from
every club in the college, such ;is,
"There will be no meeting of the
student's association today," "The
Dickens Club will not meet today,"
"Federal Council will hold no meet
ing today." "The Wake Robin Club
will not meet today." In striking
contrast was an unsigned notice:
"The faculty will meet as usual
today."
There was a colonial ball given
in the evening in the gymnasium.
The whole senior class went as
George Washington celebrators,
with labels to insure identification.
