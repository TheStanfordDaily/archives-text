An effort is being made among
some of the former members of the
Liidies' Mandolin Club to reorgan
ize and begin practise again next
week. The club did excellent work
last semester and should be con
tinued if possible. This is the only
musical organization among the
young women of the University,
and it should receive the hearty
support and encouragement of those
interested in this art.
