A wekk lias passed since the
Senior Farce Committee offered a
very liberal prize for the best farce
to lÂ»e submitted. So far scarcely
anyone has signified an intention
of entering the competition. Last
year a large number came forward
readily when Ninety-six offered a
similar prize. We see no reason
why this year our literary students
should not be willing to do their best
to make the competition successful.
The Seniors have done their part
and it remains for those who have
the ability and talent to write
farces to put forth their best efforts
in return.
