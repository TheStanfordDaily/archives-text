rmster, "She Stoops to Conquer,"
Frank Lincoln, Banjo Cluh and
Glee Cluh concerts, the Junior

Senior Vaudeville, not to speak of
the class dances, the events of Com
mencement Week, the intercolleg

be done away with, but an attempt

ute them as evenly as possible over
! the period yet remaining before lis,
|so that their intorferenee with reg
ular duties may be minimized.
