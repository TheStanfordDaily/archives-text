# An Attempted Defense
## 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto: I
would like to make a few state
ments in defense of the plan made
l>v the directors of the Co-operative
Association to form a new company
entirely their own by means of the
assets belonging to the present
stockholders. It seems that there
exist a large number of persons
who do not realize the significance
of all that is being attempted.
The first objection which the
directors have to the present sys
tem is the non-permanency of the
management —they would like to
manage it all the time. They
might secure the services of a per
manent manager of known business
ability, but they would prefer to
have no new person admitted to a
share in the administration —
there are too many in it as it is.
Furthermore, the present system
gives rise to a great many political
intrigues, of which the directors
have a more intimate knowledge
than the stockholders may suppose.
It is believed that the proposed
plan is an excellent one to abolish
further intrigue. At least the
directors mean to allow no in
triguing on the part of others if
they can help it.
The co-operative store has never
been run to make a profit, and con
sequently all that the stockholders
have is between $3,000 and $4,000
worth of books which the professors
have ordered and then decided they
would not take, and about $500
worth of cardinal stationery which
is counted as "dead stock." It is
the purpose of the present board to
present the books and stationery to
themselves for their own edifica
tion, and to give their new com
pany an air of prosperity. Their
new company will be organized un
der the amended statute, section
283, amended April 22, I<S95,
which is entirely familiar to every
body. (See our circular. The
Legislature adjourned in March,
but .)
Some of the advantages which
the directors see are these:
1. PJvery student will receive the
same benefits as every other stu
dent; that is, to speak clearly, the
system of having one price to mem
bers and a higher price to non
members but the directors. There
will be no stockholders in the or
dinary sense of the term, because if
the directors can get the books and

the stationery they will have all
the money they need to do busi
ness with on their own account;
however, if any of the students de
sire the honor of associating with
the directors in a purely nominal
way, the directors have not the
slightest objection to buying such
students a little stock-book all for
themselves. The directors have de
cided to tix the fee for honorary
stockholders at the nominal sum of
one dollar, and they especially
recommend all those to embrace
this opportunity who are looking
forward to philanthropy as their
life work. It is scarcely possible
to estimate what this may mean to
the followers of this noble profes
sion—they will be called upon to
pay all debts of the company in
any case.
2 The new company will be or
ganized with certain members of
the faculty as directors. This
ought to inspire the present stock
holders with a feeling of contidence
and make them send in their stock
and proxies to the directors in the
stamped envelopes which were pro
vided for that purpose. It is true
that certain members of the faculty
are directors in the present com
pany also. The new feature in the
case might be the resignation of the
non-faculty directors, after they
have succeeded with their colleagues
in voting to themselves the assets
of the present stockholders, or in
obtaining them otherwise through
the assistance of their combined
corps of embryo a! It rneys.
3. The term of oHice of these di
rectors will be increased to four
years to give greater pcrmanency to
the association. As the association
will consist only of the directors ilie
permanency will be all that can
be desired, unless at the end of the
fourth year they unanimously vote
themselves out of office, as they
might wish to do.
The most serious objection which
the directors find in the present
system is the stockholders, and the
ownership of the company by the
stockholders. They believe that af
ter a stockholder has contributed
his capital to the success of an en
terprise his usefulness has ceased.
The stockholder is especially incon
venient when it comes to sharing
profits. Please send in your share
and proxy to one of the board.
