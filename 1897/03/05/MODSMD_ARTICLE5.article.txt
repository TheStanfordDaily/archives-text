# SANTA CLARA TRIUMPHS.
## Wins From the Varsity in a Closely-Contested Game. 
### 
A more interesting baseball game
at this time of the season could
hardly have been expected than
yesterday's, won by Santa Clara,
4 to 8. There were many i>retty
plays combined with free hitting,
and the closeness of the score con
tributed much to the excitement.
Stanford scored three in the sec
ond inning when King and Sage
allowed Clemans' high fly ti> drop
between them. In the remaining
seven innings not a man of the
home team got by second, twelve
men being left on bases through
slow base-running and batting.
Santa Clara scored twice in the
third inning and once each in the
sixth and seventh. The visitors
fielded well, especially Connor and
Leake. .Jeffs, Strohn, and Wight
showed marked improvement in
batting strength. Jeffs stopped
more than one wild pitch behind
the bat, but his throw to second
was poor. Strohn's error was ex
cusable, and his other two chances
were taken in the best of style.
Wight and Clemans were slow in
returning balls to the infield, due
partly to the miserable condition of
the grounds. Beckett needs only
practise and encouragement to
make a first-class pitcher. Young
showed plainly the results of his
long lay-off, and has apparently for
gotten the art of waiting fora base
on balls. He is an earnest player,
however, and will round into form
with practise. Sharp's batting was
weak and he started off badly in
fielding. After the third inning he
accepted ten chances, some of them
very difficult, and many of which
would have resulted in runs if mis
handled. The nine still lack in
team-work, at the bat, and on the
bases, though there is some im
provement in these respects.
The score follows:
