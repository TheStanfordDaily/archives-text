# THE 						SUNDAY SERMON.
## Rabbi M.S. Levy of San Francisco Delivers a Splendid Address. 
### 
Rabbi MyerS. Levy of the I >t;t1 1-
Israel congregation of San Fran
cisco delivered the sermon yester
day. His subject was, "Now or
never." He said:
From remote ages men have
asked, "What shall i do to be
saved?" This question has robbed
<• youth of its pleasures and old age
of its peace. Since asking that
* question men have steadily pro
gressed.
I fully realize the value of prayer,
p«t piety alone is not sufficient to
fcjhake a man successful in lite. lie
have character. He is here
2 advance honestly. Man's work
not futile. The history of the
Kgptyrld is but the history of the
?j|asrnest work of strong lives.
There is an old German proverb
that was found engraved upon a
key: "If I rest, I rust." It is not
ease but effort that makes men.
Many hard-fought battles must yet
be waged before perfect peace is as
sured.
Our life is like a kaleidoscoj e —
it is forever changing and seems
not twice the same. To succeed we
must always have a goal before us.
A defeat must not dishearten us.
It may be our greatest victory if it
spurs us on to decisive action.
An ounce of "now" is worth a ton
of "later-ons." The most carefully
planned campaign may meet with
disaster, yet the impulsive, haphaz
ard onslaught carries the day. It
is a calamity to believe in chance.
Nature abhors it ami reason de
nounces it Life must be sober; it
must be earnest. Don't be a giant
in thought and a dwarf in action.
If we go our way promptly, doing
our duty, be the world's comment
what it may, we shall be masters
of the situation, and failures —
never.
