The present condition of affairs
at Encina llall is the subject of
much comment among those who
at present live there. The num
ber in the Hall has dwindled from
two hundred at the beginning of
the year to about seventy at the
present time. The depopulation of
the big dormitory h;is more serious
consequences than would at first be
supposed, and the present situation
is much to be lamented. The llall
is the center of University life and
spirit, the strongest supporter of
athletics and other University in
terests, and to let it die is to run
the risk of losing that university
patriotism and support that has
contributed much toward our vic
tories in athletics and oratory. It
would M'Cin that if any fault of
management or otherwise exists at
the | resent time, which operates to
bring about this unfortunate con
dition, it c mid be easily located
and presumably remedied, so that
Encina could he what it was in the
days of old.
