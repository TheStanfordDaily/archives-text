Professor 11. L. Green, who is
working to secure a practical solu
tion of the problem of Co-op. reor
ganization, has written the follow
ing in explanation of the plan pro
posed by certain members of the
faculty:
Editor Daily Palo Alto: In
the discussion of plans fora Uni
versity book store the main ques
tion should not be overlooked.
This question is, how to obtain the
lowest possible prices for books and
other supplies needed by students.
This question goes hack of consid
erations of control, or the disposi
tion of the stock of the present as
sociation. It concerns all the sin
dents of the University, and not
merely the two hundred and fifty
who are members of the present as
sociation.
The book store that sells at the
lowest prices must buy at the low
est prices, must not accumulate
dead stock, and must accumulate
and profit by its own past experi
ence.
In order to buy at the lowest
prices business must be done on a
strictly cash basis. Publishers'dis
counts for cash range from three to
six per cent. These cash discounts
will almost pay the cost of trans

portation. In order to pay cash at
all times the book store must have
good credit so that they may bor
row money on short time at reason
able interest. An Eastern pub
lisher visiting the University last
week said it would pay any book
store to do a cash business, even if
the money had to be borrowed at
ten per cent, interest.
The greatest danger to the book
store is the piling up of dead stock.
Some instructors order too many
books, some change texts without
notice, and all instructors are liable
at times to over-estimate the num
ber of books needed.
The book store should, under
present conditions, do a business
amounting to $20,000. A business
of this magnitude can not be car
ried on in the most efficient man
ner without continuity of control
and the accumulation of experience.
A board of directors which is
changed every year or two has not
the opportunity to accumulate
much useful experience, or to trans
mit it to its successor. If the man
ager is permanent and the board
temporary the control exercised by
the board will be merely nominal.
There are good arguments to
show that a book store controlled
by members of the faculty should
meet these conditions more success
fully than a book store controlled
by students. It is believed that
such a book store can borrow
money more readily than a student
organization. '1 ho dead stock
problem is a difficult one, but for
various reasons it is believed that
it can be more readily solved by
members of the faculty than by
students. Continuity ot control is
impossible in a student organiza
tion.
I purposely omit all considera
tions of college politics as affecting
the efficiency of a book store con
trolled by students, and also the
undesirable division of students
into members and non-members,
which seems necessarily involved
in student control.
These considerations have led a
number of the members of the fac
ulty to organize the '"f-tanford Uni
versity Hook Store," the purposes
and aims of which will be given in
a later issue. 11. L. Green.
