# A 						MUSICAL CONTEST.
## Stanford and Berkeley Will Give an Intercollegiate Concert. 
### 
The executive committee of the
and .Mandolin Clubs met this
afternoon and decided to accept
Berkeley's challenge to an inter
collegiate musical contest. This
action of the executive committee
is the final step which insures the
long-talked-of contest for musical
superiority between the Varsity
musicians and those across the bay.
This contest will be the first of its
kind ever held in this country and
promises to be a noted one. It
will be held on the evening of Uni
versity Day, May 7, at the San
Francisco Carnival, and will take
place either in the Baldwin or
Grand Theater. The decision as
to the merits of the clubs will be
made by regularly appointed
judges of recognized authority from
the best musical ranks of San Fran
cisco.
The clubs of both universities
have been in constant training ever
since the beginning of the college
year and are in line condition for
a battle royal. While the Stanford
clubs were making their trip North
during the Christmas vacation, the
U. C. men were as industriously
making a good reputation in the
South. Berkeley may have a slight
advantage over the cardinal
warblers from the fact that she has
anticipated the contest and is the
challenging party, but the local
clubs will be in constant training
from now until the eve of the con
test. That the training will be
very rigid is evinced by the action
of the executive committee this
afternoon in making the following
rules:
Every member missing a re
hearsal without a good excuse will
be dropped regardless of his ability.
No other excuse but for sickness or
necessary absence from the Univer
sity will be accepted.
Members who have been perma
nently chosen are: Sewall, Suther
land, Riley, McNeil, Bush, Decker,
Schneider, Abbott, Young, King,
Kaufman, Kaathoven, McGuire,
and Lanagan. The following are
accepted conditionally: Brunton,
Morgan, King, Frost, Macy, Ross,
Morrow, Strohn, and Connick.
Every inducement has been
offered by the Carnival people to
make the musical contest a finan
cial success. The advertising and
theater will be free of charge, and
the gross receipts are to be divided
between the two organizations. In
case the local musicians are vic
torious they hope to make an
Eastern trip.
The clubs have received a good
offer to give a concert in Santa Cruz,
and if arrangements can be made
for concerts in Gilroy and Watson
ville, to insure financial success, the
trip will be taken.
