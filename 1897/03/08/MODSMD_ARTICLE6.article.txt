# Why One Senator Voted "No."
## 
### 
Three weeks ago one of the stu
dents of the University addressed
a letter to his home representative
in the State Senate requesting his
support of the Stanford exemption
hill then in progress of debate.
After the bill was defeated the
Senator replied to this letter as
follows:

My Dear Sir: I was pleased to
get your letter in which you so
ably plead for Stanford. I was
sorry that I could not see that it
would have been a proper thing to
accede to your wishes. At present
1 believe it is not safe for Califor
nia to put herself in a position that
she might have to assume very
grave responsibility. The Univer
sity is a heavy load for the State to
carry. Taking that with all the
schools of the State, and our edu
cational expenses are already enor
mous.
Moreover, the non-sectarian idea
has no charm for me. A ship on
the sea must have its colors at the
masthead. So should our great
educational institutions that are
expected to mould the heart as well
as the brain of our boys and
girls, have a creed. . . .
[It is unnecessary to quote fur
ther. The bill was professedly
beaten on constitutional grounds,
and yet here we have direct evi
dence, amounting to more than a
suspicion, that other questions
than that of its constitutionality
contributed to secure the defeat.
The University is safe so long as
objection is made only on this
score. There is an end to prejudice
of all sorts, and an end to legis
latures also. â€”Ed.]
