# FOUNDER'S DAY.
## EXERCISES IN THE CHAPEL LAST NIGHT. Address by Dr. Stillman on the Foundation of Stanford University. 
### 
The annual exercises in com
memoration of the founding of the
University were held in the chapel
lust evening. The exercises were
impressive and a large audience
was in attendance. Dr. J. M.
Stillman gave a short introductory
address, reviewing the history of the
foundation of the University. He
spoke as follows:

The clay we commemorate is the
first official act of the foundation of
the University, and we observe it
as a holiday in recognition of the
significance of that event so import
ant to us as members of the Uni
versity, and in recognition of our
obligation to the founders. In the
short time at my disposal this
evening 1 shall confine myself to a
brief sketch of the principal events
that have made up the present
foundation of the University.
Twelve years ago today the en
dowment act was signed by the
Governor of the State. This act
prescribed the conditions under
which grants and bequests for the
establishment and maintenance of
a university might he made so that
its organization as projected might
be under the protection of the state
law. On November 11, 1885, was
signed by Leland Stanford and
.lane L. Stanford the grant of en
dowment of the Leland Stanford
Junior University, by which was
transferred to the trustees therein
named the Gridley farm in Butte
county, the Vina farm in Tehama
county, and the Palo Alto estate in
Santa Clara and San Mateo coun
ties, aggregating over 85,000 acres
of land. On the 14th of November
the deed was accepted by the
trustees.
The grant provided for the loca
tion of the University on the Palo
Alto estate, the reasons being, in
ilie words of the founders, "its per
sonal associations, which are most
dear to us, the excellence of its cli
mate, and its accessibility" On
May 14,1887, thecorner-stone of the
quadrangle was laid by Senator
Stanford, the Rev. Horatio Stebbins
offering the prayer, and the late
Judge Lorenzo Sawyer delivering
the address. These three dates I
mark the three great events in the
official founding of the University.
But the real founding of the Uni
versity did not end here.
The fourth <ireat event in chron
ological order was of great import
in determining the line of devel
opment of the new University.
This was in March, 1891, when
David Starr Jordan was selected by
the founders for the Presidency. I
sincerely doubt whether another
could have been selected who would
have so grandly met the high re
sponsibilities of his important po
sition. There may be some college
presidents who excel him in some
more or less useful qualifications,
but I know of none who equal him

in the great essentials. We do not
realize, I am sure, how much we
owe to him, though we all know we
owe much.
On October 1, 1891, came the
formal opening of the University,
with some thirty instructors and
the surprising number of four hun
dred students in attendance. The
prospects were indeed bright, but
the young University was not to be
without its chastening trials. First
came the financial crisis culminat
ing in the panic of 1893, which
straitened the resources of even the
great property of Senator Stanford,
and necessitated a less rapid ex
pansion of the University. Then in
1893 came that heavy blow,the death
of Senator Stanford whose generous
and kindly heart had conceived the
noble benefaction whose benefits we
enjoy.
1 need not recall to you the dark
days which followed, the income
from the estate tied up in the courts,
and then the cruel suit brought to
absorb the estate. We can not
realize tlie self-sacrifice and the
courage with which Mrs. Stanford
struggled to keep open the doors of
the University. With a less heroic
devotion on the part of Mrs. Stan
ford she would have yielded to the
great pressure and closed the Uni
versity during the settlement of the
estate. Without the consummate
leadership of Dr. Jordan it is doubt
ful if its organization of faeultj'
and students could have been held
together.
1 do not need to recall to you the
joyful lifting of that heavy burden
of anxiety when the United States
Supreme Court dismissed the case
against the estate, thus assuring
the safety of our prospective en
dowments. With this danger re
moved Mrs. Stanford was enabled
to carry out the next important act
in the foundation of the University
by transferring to the trustees on
April 29, 1891), $2,500,000 in
interest-bearing bonds, being the
bequest of Senator Stanford by his
will. By this act the University
first came into possession of an in
come independent of the direct acts
of the founders, for heretofore the
annual expenses of the University
had been paid by Senator Stanford,
or si nee his death, from the personal
income of Mrs. Stanford. The in
come thus guaranteed is, to be sure,
not equal even to the present cost
of the maintenance of the Univer
sity, but it at least provides a
nucleus sufficient to assure a
permanent activity and usefulness.
The latest great act in our
foundation was the gift by Mrs.
Stanford of the valuable residence
property in San Francisco and the
valuable collections therein con
tained. This property, deeded on
February 11, 1897, while not of
immediate use for the University,
will in time become of great value
in its future development.
With all this great endowment
the University is still to some ex
tent hampered by the lack of an
immediate income available for
annual expenses. For the great
estates bring in as yet no return
commensurate with their value.
They represent a secure and doubt
less a great income in the future,
but not for today. The estate of

Senator Stanford is still unsettled,
and until that settlement is com
plete no part of its income can be
used for the support of the Uni
versity. We had hoped that the
| , resent needs of the University
might bj to a certain extent
assisted by the release from tax
ation of the University domain,
but our hope 3 have been disap
pointed; not, to be sure, on account
of any opposition to the Univer
sity, but on account of the fears of
many that such a measure might
prove a dangerous precedent, or be
cause of doubts as to the consti
tutionality of the law if passed.
It is to be noticed that the great
donations that make up the en
dowment of our University have
been without any assistance or co
operation of the state, of the gen
eral government, or of any munici
pality. The work of foundation
lias been carried on by the founders
almost unassisted; and at times it
would seem as if they must have felt
as if their great generosity was but
faintly appreciated. The full ap
preciation of their deeds will come
in time, and its measure will be
full indeed. I have said "almost
unassisted," but I should note the
fact that along with several smaller
gifts to library or equipment, it is
necessary to make one notable ex
ception to this statement. One
other has had the honor, and will
shine in the glory of this founda
tion. By the building and the con
stant support of the seaside labor
atory at Pacific Grove, and by the
gift and maintenance of the rail
road library, and the library of bi
ology, and by many and constant
lesser gifts, Mr. Timothy Hopkins
has earned a place in the affection
ate regard of the friends of the
University nearest to the lofty
places in which are held its found
ers and its president. How much
his sympathetic support and free
handed generosity have lightened
the labors and gladdened the hearts
of the founders and of the presi
dent, they alone can tell.
Such has been the record of our
foundation to the present time. As
to what the immediate future has
in store lies not in my knowledge,
but so that life and strength be
spared to Mrs. Stanford and to
President Jordan, we may trust
confidently to the unconquerable
devotion of the one, to the great
leadership of the other, and to the
superb courage of both that "all
will yet be well."
Miss Edith Jagger of Palo Alto
rendered a vocal solo, "Sing, O
Heart," and Rev. M. C. Briggs of
San Jose, a pioneer Californian and
a personal friend of Senator Stan
ford, delivered the address of the
evening. He paid a glowing trib
ute to the memory of the founder,
whom he described as a man that
struggled from poverty to riches,
from obscurity to prominence and
esteem. He discussed the true
function of universities and made a
plea for greater religious training,
quoting Senator Stanford in saying
that "this University should teach
Christianity, though dogmatism
should be eschewed."
The last number on the program
was a song, "Ave Maria," by Miss
Jagger.
