Nothing in this part of Califor
nia is considered by tourists as
more worthy of a visit than the
Lick Observatory. And yet there
are many Stanford students who
have spent three or four years in
plain view of this world-renowned
observatory without ever paying it
a visit. Now that the time of year
has come when many excursion
parties are being made up for visit
ing various places of interest, this
point should not be lost sight of.
A rate of three dollars for the round
trip from San Jose to Mt. Hamil
ton has recently been made to Stan
ford students. For large parties
the rate is less. The trip can be
made by leaving Palo Alto Satur
day and returning Sunday morn
ing. With these inducements
many parties from Stanford should
take that delightful trip up Mt.
Hamilton before the semester closes.
