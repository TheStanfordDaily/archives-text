William McKinley, who is an
honorary member of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, is the fifth President who
has been a member of a greek let
ter society. Garfield, Arthur,
Harrison, and Cleveland were all
connected with some college frater
nity either as active or honorary
members.
Assemblyman Bondy has intro
duced into the New York legisla
ture a bill to exempt tlie property
of Greek letter fraternities from
taxation. The bill stands a chance
of being passed, as both the chair
man of the committee on taxation
and the Republican leader Nixon
are fraternity men.
