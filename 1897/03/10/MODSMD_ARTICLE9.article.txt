Berkeley is putting forth every
effort to turn out a strong team for
the Intercollegiate Debate. Up to
this time thirty-three men have en

working for places on the team.

ial which appeared recently in the

ever to heat Berkeley on the ros
trum, it is now time for us to dis
pel all of it that remains.
