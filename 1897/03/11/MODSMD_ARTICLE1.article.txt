# UNIVERSITY BOOK STORE.
## The 						Faculty Will Start a Store Where All Will be Treated Alike. 
### 
The opinion seems to be unani
mous among the stockholders
that the Co-operative Association
should disincorporate. There can
be no rivalry between this associa
tion and any proposed organization
which is to take its place. The
field is thus open for the discussion
of plans fora new book store
After thoroughly .studying the
question involved, a number of
gentlemen on the faculty have pro
posed the organization of the Stan
ford University Book Store. Among
those at present interested in this
organization are Professors Rich
ardson, Kellogg, Show, Murray,
W ing, Sheldon, Uoskins, Ross, (Gil
bert, Lathrop, and Powers. The
members will loan their credit for
the purpose of obtaining the money
needed to do business on a cash
basis, and will be responsible for
the management of the book store.
The articles of incorporation will
provide that the members shall
receive none of the profits. No fee
will be charged, and prices will be
the same for everyone connected
with the University. Detailed
statements concerning the business
of the book store will lie published
in the college paper from time to
time.
It has been argued that the or
ganization of a book store concerns
not merely the stockholders of the
old association but every member
of the University. This certainly
is true. Seven hundred students
who are not members <>112 the old as
sociation and who have never re
ceived any favors in the way of re
duced prices should be interested in
this question as much as the two
hundred and fifty who are mem
bers. These seven hundred stu
dents are paying high prices to the
Co-operative Association in order
that the members may have lower
prices. Only one fourth of the stu
dents are members of the associa
tion, and it is doubtful if at any
time in its history one half of the
students were members. The mem
bers have not conducted the asso
ciation for all the students but for
themselves alone. The members
are not to be censured for this.
Such discrimination seems to be
necessary in any plan of student
management. The proposed Uni
versity book store will treat all
alike, and it is believed by the pro
jectors that prices can be at once
made lower to everyone than they
are now to members of the old as
sociation.
The disposition of the old stock
of the Co-operative Association is a
matter for the old stockholders to
determine. No one will criticise
them for obtaining all they
can for it. Those concerned in the
proposed University book store
would prefer to have nothing to do
with it. Its purchase by them
would probably tie up $1000 for
one year and possibly two years.
However, believing that the new
store could dispose of the old stock
to better advantage than any other
one, it was considered nothing more
than just to offer as much as the
members believed it to be worth.
For various reasons it was thought

best to make a cash offer. The
proposed book store has offered
.$l7OO cash for the merchandise,
building, and fixtures of the old as
sociation. This with $800 cash on
hand makes .$2OOO in cash which
the old association will have.
Against this there are debts of
about -$1150, leaving about .$1.25
for each shareholder.
I may add that no member of
the board of directors of the old
association is a member of the new
association, and that no member of
the iievv association has asked that
the old association should donate
its assets (and liabilities) to the
new one. However, if the exist
ence of the new book store depended
upon such donation, I think it
could be maintained that each
stockholder would be a gainer by
such gift in the lower prices he
would obtain. R. L. Green.
