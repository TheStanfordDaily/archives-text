Some of the professors realize the
importance of more recreation in
fresh air for students who work
prodigiously over their hooks, and
suggest that they leave a small
margin of time each day for out
door amusements. These beautiful
days certainly should he improved
hy every one, for at this lime of the
year they are none too frequent.
The various forms of amusement,
such as inter-class hase'oall games,
tennis tournaments, etc. should at
tract the students to attend, though
they may not participate in them.
As far as possible students should
engage in some form of active ex
ercise out of doors each day, and
while those who do participate are
encouraged and supported hy a
large crowd of spectators, little
physical recreation or benefit is de
rived by watching others do the
work.
