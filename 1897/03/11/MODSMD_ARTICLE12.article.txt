# An English View of Football.
## 
### 
American football is declared by
English experts to be the most
"punishing" game known to civil
ization, and English sporting peo
ple are informed that its secret is a
training of which persons in the
Old World have absolutely no con
ception. To such degree is this
training carried that the prediction
is made that whenever English and
American athletes shall meet dur
ing the next few years upon terms
of equality the Americans, in nine
cases out of ten, will carry every
thing before them by reason of the
more severe preparation they have
undergone and the more perfect
physical condition to which they
have attained. "American foot
ball, if so fierce and severe upon its
players, is only so in proportion to
their bodily calibre."
