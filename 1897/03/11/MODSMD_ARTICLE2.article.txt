# TOMORROW NIGHT'S SHOW.
## Our Local Talent Will Appear for the Benefit of '98 Annual. 
### 
Oliver Goldsmith's great comedy
"She Stoops to Conquer," or "A
Rloody Mistake, Don't You Know,"
will hold the boards at the gymnas
ium tomorrow night. Manager Ir
win already has the campus thor
oughly billed, and announces the
arrival of the Sword and Sandals
company tomorrow. Gentle reader,
there will be 40 stars —40. The
play is produced for the benefit of
charity —specifically, the '1)8 An
nual. Other features in addition to
this are the spectacular parts.
The performance is an assured
success. Over six hundred tickets
have been sold, and the company
will come in over Hracchi's fast
line and stop at the Hotel de An
zini in a nearby hamlet, in order to
give the cast a Shaksperean inspira

misled. Manager Irwin will not
appear on the platform, but anyone
with a lively imagination or good
ears can get four bits' worth of in
formation if they will just think of
him working in the flies.
The play "She Stoops to Con
quer" is too well known to admit of
comment. Wherever English drama
holds a place in the hearts of the
people this pi ay is known. The
plot of the play hinges on the cir
cumstance of a private house being
mistaken for an inn, where two
young men go to take an inning
and capture a partner for life, bet
ter or worse, and all that. After
considerable talk and hard work re
plete with promptings by the man
agement, the young men succeed in
their mission, a young lady says
some poetry, the curtain goes down,
and the management will no longer
be compelled to cut classes.
