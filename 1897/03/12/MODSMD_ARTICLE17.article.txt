Tomorrow occurs the track con
test between the team of the Oak
land High School and the Fresh
man team. Our Freshmen have
trained conscientiously this year,
and their work has shown that this
class contains some excellent track
men. In no better way can the
students encourage these new men
in their work than by a large at
tendance at tomorrow's contest.
Besides, the proceeds are to be used
to defray the expenses of the coach,
which fact alone should add to the
interest in tomorrow's games.
