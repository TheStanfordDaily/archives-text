The part which college men have
taken in the work of the present
Legislature is worthy of comment.
They have stood for honest admin
istration and good government.
They have been exceptionally hon
est compared to other members of
the legislative body. As a rule
principles such as one acquires
through education and study have
a less important and less powerful
influence at Sacramento than is
wielded by something else of a quite
different nature. But the college
men have done much good work in
spite of the powerful "pull" of the
"third house."
