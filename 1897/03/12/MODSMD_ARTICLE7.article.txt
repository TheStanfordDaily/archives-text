# NEW FRATERNAL SOCIETIES.
## Delta Gamma and Alif Ha to be Represented in the Stanford Community. 
### 
The Greek world is today aug
mented by the establishment of
the Upsilon chapter of the national
fraternity of Delta Gamma. In
addition to this the announcement
is made of the establishment of a
fraternity named by two letters of
the Arabic alphabet, Alif Ha.
Delta Gamma is one of the lead
ing sororities of the East, and its
chapter roll contains most of the
larger colleges of the country. Its
conservative policy is shown by the
fact that Upsilon is but the four
teenth chapter to be established.
The initiatory ceremonies were
conducted by Miss Price of the Chi
(Cornell) chapter and Miss Whit
tier of the Delta (University of
Southern California) chapter. The
young ladies who constitute the
new chapter are Lillian Ray, '97,
Rose Smith, '97, Ida Beermaker,
'98, Alexandra Fay, '98, Louise
Gerichs, '98, Parnie Hamilton, '98,
Winifred Taylor, '98, Florence
Whittier, '99, Ethel Coblentz, '00,
and Fleda Perrin, sp. This list of
charter members includes many of
the prominent women of the Uni
versity, and the accession of this
new sorority will be warmly wel
comed. The members are to be
congratulated upon the granting of
the charter, since the matter has
been pending for several months
and the charter was secured only
after perseverance by the appli
cants.
The Arabic letter fraternity, Alif
Ha, was established January 7 of,
the present year, and is a . local so
ciety. The members are W. H. F.
Titus, Raban of Islam Temple,
Mystic Shrine; M. C. Leaventritt,
'99; J. I. Walter, '00; and H. D.
Walter, '00.
The cave at Frenchman's Lake
has been secured by the mem
bers from the University authori
ties and will be used as a hall of
initiation and ceremonials. The
fraternity will have no house this
semester but the members will re
side in Encina. At the end of the
semester a banquet will be given to
the officers of the Mystic Shrine.
The colors of the new society are
green and white, and the badge
consists of a green and white rib
bon worn in the lapel of the coat.
Pins will soon be received, however,
to be used in place of the ribbon.
While Alif Ha is local, it is mod
eled after similar societies that exist
in Eastern colleges.
