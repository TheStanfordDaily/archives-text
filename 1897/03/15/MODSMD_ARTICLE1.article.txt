# SUCCESSFUL PERFORMANCE.
## Sword and Sandals Presents Goldsmith's Comedy to a Large House. 
### 
The comedy ''She Stoops to Con
quer," which was given by Sword
and Sandals Friday evening, was a
success from many standpoints.
Owing to the jjopularity of the
play itself much interest was taken
in its presentation by local drama
tic talent, and the tickets were all
sold long before the performance
began. A larger house seldom
greets any entertainment in Stan
ford, and many visitors from a
distance were present. The play
was correctly staged and costumed,
and the scenery and lights were
well managed. The gymnasium
was converted into a comfortable
auditorium with chairs arranged
to give the best possible view of the
stage. The music discoursed be
tween acts was presented without
any previous preparation, which
made its poor quality excusable.
The play is comparatively easy to
act, owing to its wit and mirth.
The plot is familiar to every lover
of English drama and needs no fur
ther comment.
The play as a whole was well
rendered considering the fact that
few of the performers have had any
previous study in dramatic art.
From the standpoint of art, the
interpolation of Tony Lumpkitis'
part deserves severe criticism. He
is intended to be intelligent but
reckless, and full of mischievous
pranks; but as it was interpreted
he was both ignorant and uncouth.
A wrong impression of the charac
ter was given from what the author
intended. Mr. Briscoe as Tony
was undoubtedly the star of the
evening. His jokes were served
alike on all about him, regardless
of person. His mother is often
made the victim of his ludicrous
pranks. The real peronality of
the actor is kept in the background,
and Mr. Briscoe seemed to be very
much at home in all his lines.
The part of young Marlowe was
also well taken by Mr. Riley. His
manner was easy and finished.
Miss Dinkelspiel as Miss Hard
castle, the leading lady of the plot,
was very pretty and winning. Her
enunciation and acting were good,
but lacked animation. Miss Ferral
read her lines with considerable
animation and feeling. Her part
was a difficult one but was well
handled. Miss Morley took her
part under difficulty because of
nervousness. She showed a good
understanding of her lines and her
acting was good. Mr. Price acted
the part of Mr. Hardcastle with
vim and spirit. The role required
a good voice and action, and Mr.
Price acquitted himself very credit
ably. Diggory, the Irish servant,
as impersonated by \\ alter Mcin
tosh, was one of the best pieces of
acting in the caste. His dialect
and action together were excellent.
The other parts which were less
important helped to make the play
a success and were well taken. The
play was given with a sparkle and
life that was very pleasing, and it
was free from breaks and prompt
ings which always attend amateur
performances.
The Junior Annual, for whose

benefit the play was given, will
realize about seventy-five dollars
from the proceeds of the entertain
ment.
