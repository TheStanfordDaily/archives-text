men on the track?lA#t Saturday en
courages all who al-e interested in
the spring games to hope that our
athletes will acquit themselves cred
itably when they go against Berke
ley. The good showing made by
1900 ought to serve as an inspira
tion to those men who have hereto
fore lagged in their work or refused
to answer the call of coach and cap
tain when they are capable of help
ing to win a victory.
