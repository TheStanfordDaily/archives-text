With the return of good weather,
practise on the track and diamond
should begin in earnest. Much
hard and consistent training is
necessary to make victory possible;
more than this the men need the
hearty support and interest of the
members of the student body. Come
out to see the practise, attend the
match games; and don't begrudge
the small fee that is charged; it all
goes to a good cause and is used in
perfecting the development of our
men into record breakers for Stan
ford. Our college spirit is good,
but we should pursue it into some
material results.
