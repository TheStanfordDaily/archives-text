The plan of inter-society contests
in debate, which was tried here for
the first time last Saturday night,
has shown itself to be adapted to
(he needs of our debating interests.
Three things appear to he absolute
necessities for the development of
good debates —large audiences, en
thusiasm, and intelligent criticism.
These three desiderata are evi
dently secured in the present plan
better than in any other yet tried.
The attendance of the members of
all the societies gives the speaker
an audience about five times as large
as he can hope for under ordinary
circumstances; the contest for the
inter-society championship puts
enough at stake to warrant perse
vering efforts in preparation; and
the criticism by members of the
faculty is valuable in suggesting
numerous lines of improvement.
There can be no doubt as to our
need at Stanford of training in de
bate. There can be no doubt of
the value training in debate has
for the practical man of today. If
it is true that a wise method of se
curing this training has been found
and has been adapted to our pre
viously organized societies, let us
all lend it our hearty support and
strive to insure its continuance.
