# WIN ON TRACK AND FIELD.
## Freshman Team Defeats the Oakland High School in Saturday's Games. 
### 
The athletic contest between the
Freshmen and the Oakland High
School last Saturday proved to be
closer than was expected. The
good-sized crowd present was
patient and appreciative, in spite
of the slow track and long waits
between events.
The best actual performances
were the quarter-mile run of Cado
gan, O. 11. S., in 53 4-5 sec., and
the 12-lb. hammer-throw of Plaw,
O. 11. S. The Coast inter-scholas
tic record for the latter event has
been 133 feet 9 inches, but Plaw
tossed the weight 143 feet (>$
inches.
For Stanford the work of Morgan
and Burnette in the hurdles and
the distance runs is too well known
to need comment. Burnette proved
himself to be a heady runner and a
bard finisher. Neither of the men
were forced to exert themselves to
win. Birtch won the 100-yd. dash
in time equal to 10 4-5 sec., and he
may prove to be a first-class man.
Had not Harter fallen six feet from
the tape he would certainly have
taken second in this event. NVil
son made a creditable showing in
the quarter, where his best talent
seems to lie.
The high-jump was taken easily
by Kerrigan. The little,fellow has
not reached his form of last year,
however.
Boyd won the pole-vault in good
style, but will not be needed so
badly in that event as in the high
jump, where he won only third.
Daggett won second place in both
the distance runs, beating out his
Oakland competitor in the half
mile by a close and exciting finish.
The great weakness of the Fresh
men, as indeed of the Varsity team,
lies in the absence of men for the
weights and the mile,walk.
The final score stood: Stanford
Freshmen 62, 0. H. S. 55. First
