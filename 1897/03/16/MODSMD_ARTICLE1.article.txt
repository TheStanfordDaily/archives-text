# NEW PLANS PROPOSED.
## Student Committee Considers Methods of Dealing- with the Co-op. Problem. 
### 
At the Friday afternoon meeting!
of the committee of the student!
body, appointed to make recom-1
mendations of the sentiment ot
students concerning the Co-op. re
organization, a number of sugges
tions were considered.
The following set. of resolutions
was framed by one of the mem
bers, with the idea that they should
be presented at a student body
meeting. Their consideration would
bring out the sentiment of the meet
ing in regard to the fundamental
proposition of whether or not the
business of furnishing books is to
go out of the hands of the students:
Whereas, The present Co-oper
ative Association has proved i'self
unsatisfactory and cumbrous in iis
management;
Resolved, That the best interests
of the student body demand its
withdrawal from active business
operations, and a transfer of its
property to some new enterprise;
Resolved, That the new plan out
lined by Professor Green in the
Daily Palo Alto of March 18, and
embodied in the "Stanford Univer
sity Book Store" is best calculated
to meet the wants of the students;
And, whereas, It seems desirable
that the proposed Stanford Univer
sity Book Store may be so consti
tuted that it may command to the
greatest possible extent the confi
dence of the student body;
Resolved, That the incorporators
of the said Stanford University
Book Store be requested to include
in their plan of organization a sec
tion making the president and
treasurer of the Associated Students
ex-officio members of the auditing
committee of the corporation.
Another member proposed the
following as a plan of reorganiza
tion :
1. Any member of the student
body or of the faculty shall I e en
titled on application to a certificate
of membership, such certificate to
become void and the holder to
cease membership upon severing
his connection with the University.
2. There shall be no capital
stock and no membership fee.
3. There shall be a board of nine
directors, six of whom shall be
from the student body chosen by a
majority vote of the student mem
bers, and three from the faculty
chosen by a majority vote of the
faculty members. The six directors
from the student body shall, serve
for the term of one year. The three
directors from the faculty shall
serve for the term of three years,
except that at the first election they
shall be chosen for one, two, and
three years respectively, so that
one shall retire each year.
4. Manager—(a) If it is decided to
have a student manager such man
ager shall be chosen by a majority
vote of the members; and an assist
ant manager chosen to succeed in
one year as manager, (b) If, how
ever, it is thought best to employ a
manager not connected with the
University, the selection of such
manager shall be vested in the
board of directors.
5. Compensation of Manager —

The compensation (if the manager
shall be left to the discretion of the
board of directors; provided, how
ever, that such compensation for
any year shall not exceed ten (10)
per cent, of the gross sales of the
year.
It is urged on behalf of this plan
that it will insure efficiency as well
as any other, while at the same
time retaining the management un
der the control of the students. It
is said that in the long run that
system will prove best in which the
manager is most directly responsi
ble to the student body; and that
the principle of co-operation should
not be given up unless absolutely
necessary—unless it can be proved
that the defects of the old system
can not be cured without adopting
the drastic measures proposed by
some members of the faculty.
The question of student or out
side manager is left open —those fa
voring the general principle of stu
dent control differing upon this
question. It is claimed, however,
that if it is decided to have a stu
dent manager, such manager should
be elected by a majority vote of the
members, as this would prevent the
board of directors from being packed
for Ihe sole purpose of electing a
particular candidate at the expense
of the other duties which devolve
upon the board.
This plan suggested the follow
ing offer to be made to the pres
ent association by the new organi
zation: That the new association
agree upon three appraisers and
that these appraisers make an in
ventory of the property of the old
corporation; that such property be
then transferred to the new associa
tion and the stockholders be given
in payment therefor certificates of
credit (good for merchandise imme
diately upon organization, or for
cash one year from date) equal to
the appraised value of the property
divided by the number of shares is
sued.
A student body meeting will be
held some time this week to outline
a method of procedure.
