The editor of the Occident in a
recent issue severely criticises the
baseball men of the U. C. varsity
for failure to practise diligently,
and also the U. C. student body for
failure to give the team sufficient
encouragement. His remarks would
be somewhat too severe to apply to
Stanford conditions, but the fact
remains that regular attendance
and hard work are needed to turn
out a winning team. So far this
year the team has received only or
dinary encouragement from the
students. Tomorrow an enthusias
tic gathering on the bleachers
should witness the first game of the
league.
