The Executive Committee re
cently took a step towards securing
photographs of all the University
teams that have competed for Stan
ford since the opening of the Uni
versity. These are to be placed in
the museum with the few other tro
phies that are there gathered. A
well-arranged collection of trophies
does much to preserve the memory
of past victories and is a powerful
factor in arousing enthusiasm in
the students who come afterwards.
The attempt to add to the utility of
our trophy room is especially op
portune at the present time, as a
further delay might render any fu
ture attempt unsuccessful.
