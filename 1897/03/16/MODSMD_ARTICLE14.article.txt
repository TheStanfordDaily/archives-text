# Pacific Grove and Monterey.
## 
### 
A greatly reduced rate to Monte
rey and Pacific Grove has been se
cured for those who wish to visit
these places during the coining va
cation. The fare will he hut three
dollars for the round trip, and the
same rate will be made for round
trip tickets to Santa Cruz. This is
hut a trifle over the regular single
fare.
Professor 11. 11. Powers and wife
will this year chaperon the party
which goes to Pacific drove, and
all who intend to make that trip
should notify hi in as soon as pos
si I >le.
Tickets will he good going on
Friday and Saturday, March ID
and 20, and returning up to and
including March 31.
Last year about fifty persons
made the excursion to Pacific
Grove, and the natural beauties of
that resort, together with the ex
ceedingly low rate, should attract
at least as large a number this
vear.
