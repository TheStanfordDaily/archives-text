# ANOTHER DORMITORY
## Presbyterians May Establish a Hall to Accommodate Their Student Members. 
### 
Rev. Robert Mackenzie, I). I)., I
and Rev. Theo. F. Burnham visited
the University recently and were
shown over the campus by Profes
sor Grifiin. At the last meeting
of the Synod of California of the
Presbyterian Church these gentle
men were appointed on a committee
to devise means for establishing a
hall or dormitory at Berkeley and
Stanford, which shall be set apart
for students who come from Pres
byterian families. Rev. Mackenzie |
and Rev. Burnham are now mak
ing their investigations in both!
universities with a view to estab- j
lishing such balls.
The movement on the part of the
Presbyterian Synod is the result of !
the establishing of such halls or
dormitories in Eastern colleges by
various religious denominations. |
At Michigan the Roman Catholics'
have established the Foley Guild.!
The Episcopalians have Harris
Hall, and the Presbyterians have
founded Tappan Hall. Such halls
are usually presided over by a tffean
appointed by the denomination and j
have no connection with the college |
at which they are located. The
halls usually contain libraries, and
special lectureships are usually
maintained. Daily chapel services
and religious services under the di
rection of the dean are a part of
such institutions. The movement
is the result of a desire on the part
of the various religious denomina
tions to offer a congenial home for
the students of their denomination
where religious instruction may be
had as well as the advantages of
attendance at a large university.
In case the committee reports fa-!
vorably such a hall may be estab-I
lished for Presbyterian students at I
Stanford, either on the campus or!
at Palo Alto.
