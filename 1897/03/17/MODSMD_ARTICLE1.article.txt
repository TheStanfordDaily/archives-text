# FIRST LEAGUE GAME.
## 
### 
Both Teams Play Good Ball but!
Stanford Wins From Santa Clara, i
Stanford's first game in the|
League was won today by the score |
of 3to 2. No runs were made by!
either side up to the seventh inning, j
when the visitors scored twice,
Stanford tying in the first of the
eighth.
The winning run was made in the
ninth inning on hits made by Mc-j
Laine and JefiV, after two men were |
out.
But one hit and no runs were
made off Beckett in the six innings j
in which he officiated in tlie box. i
His work is constantly improving.
Kelly was also effective, McLaine
being the only man able to hit him j
hard.
Stanford's batting is still scatter
ing; Thompson, Beckett, and Clem
atis nre still weak, while Young lias
improved somewhat. Clematis'
fielding was very steady, and
Lougheed made one or two very j
pretty plays. Young is weak on
thrown balls. Wight's and Strohn's!
errors were excusable.
The Santa Clara shortstop, Leake, I
made several brilliant stops, but
drew the first-baseman off twice
by curved throws. The play of
Santa Clara was marred by the
many muffs of the left-fielder,
Sage; none of his errors resulted j
in runs, however.
Two games have now been played
in the League, Berkeley winning
from Olympic, and Stanford from
Santa Clara. Stanford plays the!
Olympics in San Francisco on
Saturday. The score:
STANFORD.
