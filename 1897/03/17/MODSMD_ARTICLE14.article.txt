The fact that the student body
makes no distinction in charging
for admission l<> giiines between
those who [»ay their student body
assessments and those who do not,
has served as a ground of complaint
against the present system. It is
alleged that the payers of student
body fees should receive some com
mensurate remuneration for so do
ing, in the shape of free admission
to games on the campus. It is true
that the athletic, associations of
some Kastern colleges, whose mem
bership is not identical with the
student body, admit members who
have paid their assessments to
uaines, free of charge, while the out
siders are compelled to pay. Hut
there is this difference between this
system and our own—that the
yearly assessments are four or five
times as large as ours, and pome
times greater sti 11. If our yearly
fee was increased to a like amount,
lh" student bodv could well afford
to adopt such a system, but under
present conditions it would be im-
I racticable. In the future, however,
it might be advisable to increase
I lie asse.-sment and grant to the
payers thereof increased privileges,
thus making greater the induce
ments to pay it.
