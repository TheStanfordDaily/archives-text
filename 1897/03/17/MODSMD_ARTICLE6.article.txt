The action of n number of Yale
men in sending a Vale Hag to Cor
bet! lias occasioned much comment.
The offenders have been severely!
censured by the faculty of the uni
versity and have met with little I
commendation from their fellow ;
I collegians. The Yale News of re-1
i cent date makes the following state- j
i ment of the sentiment of the uni-j
! versify regarding the affair:
"The letter printed in one of the j
| New York papers yesterday, writ
ten and signed by a few men in
the junior class, is utterly disowned
and repudiated by Yale under-1
graduates.
"Its senders doubtless composed
the document with the idea that it :
would be a good joke, but where!
this comes in it is hard to see, even
for men in college, while outsiders
and graduates will certainly con- j
sider it a most serious thing.
"The very fact that it purported
to represent the opinion of the uni
; versity on an event that should be
! and is of no interest here, absolutely
i prevents its being considered as a
I joke, nor are the harm it has done
' Yale and the strong condemnation

of it by many communications6ent
to the Nevox very funny tilings.
By pretending to give college senti
inent or even implying that there
is college sentiment on such a sub
ject, the letter is a direct insult to
every Yale man.
"Then,too,the disgrace to the uni
versity in having its Hag appear in
the prize-lighting ring can not be
measured or perhaps appreciated
at once. It seems too bad that
Yale men should so often be the
first to throw mud at Yale, but it is
certainly so in this case, and all
that the guilty ones can do is to
beg pardon for it."
