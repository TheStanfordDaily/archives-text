### 
The Zoology Club met Monday
evening ;it Dr. Gilbert's. Mr. John
Y.m Denburg, '5)4, of the California
Academy of Science, read a very
interesting paper on the poison of
the Gila monster. Mr. Van Den
burg reviewed the different theories
and investigations that have been
made of this interesting animal,
and then described a series of ex
periments conducted by himself on
the venomous qualities of the mon
ster's saliva. These experiments of
his have proved without doubt that
there is present in the saliva a
deadly poison, and have rectified
many of the mistakes made by for
mer investigators.
