The University Register for 1896-
97 will be ready for delivery about
the first of April. It is printed by
the same firm as last year and does
not differ in appearance, arrange
ment, or number of pages from the
Register for 1895-96. The names
of two new trustees are included;
the first, Mr. Josiah W. Stanford
of Warm Springs, Cal., a nephew
of Senator Stanford, appointed to
fill the vacancy made by the resig
nation of Justice Stephen A. Field;
the second, Russell J. Wilson of
San Francisco, taking the place of
Alfred L. Tubbs, deceased. The
full number of twenty-four is now
complete, and, as announced in
Mrs. Stanford's recent address to
the Trustees, no more vacancies are
to be filled until the number is re
duced to fifteen; and future ap
pointments will be for the period of
ten years only. All the present
members of the board were ap
pointed for life.
The faculty list contains no
names not on this year's schedule,
but several promotions are noted.
Associate Professors Fairclough, La
throp, and Thoburn become full
professors. Assistant Professor
McFarland is made associate pro
fessor; and Instructors Murphy,
Stearns, Marx, and Rendtorff be
come assistant professors. Assist
ants Farmer and Blichfeldt become
instructors.
The library shows an increase of
five thousand books and five thou
sand pamphlets.
Announcement is made on page
35 that, in future, entrance examin
ations will not be held elsewhere
than at the University. There are
no changes in requirements. Un
der "University Regulations" there
is one important change. Hereafter
matriculated students who do riot
register on the appointed registra
tion days will not be required to
get any special permission to regis
ter late. The new rule is given on
page 40, as follows: "Matriculated
students who do not obtain permis
sion in advance to delay registra
tion may register after the ap
pointed registration days only on
payment of an additional fee of
two dollars."
The courses of instruction do not
differ essentially from those in the
previous Register; there are, how
ever, some interesting variations.
The department of Archaeology dis
appears and that of Classical Phil
ology takes its place. Under this
head Prof. Miller will offer a num
ber of new courses next year. In
English a one-hour course in Elo
cution running through the year
will be given by Prof. Lathrop;
and Forensics is made a year
course. Under English there is
also announced a course in General
Bibliography, for the first semester,
which will be given by Assistant
Librarian Teggart.
In Education the courses for next
year are not outlined, but mention
is made of Prof. Barnes' contem
plated absence, and of Prof. Star
buck's courses. It is announced
also that Instructor Schallenberger
will return; and that Mrs. Mait
land will offer two courses in the
department. In History two addi

tional courses will be offered by
Prof. Kriehn, while Mrs. Barnes'
work will necessarily be omitted
next year. The courses in Eco
nomics and Sociology have been
considerably remodeled. The most
important announcement is that of
the return of Prof. Warner, who
will give two courses during the
first semester, one on Personal Eco
nomics and one on Corporate in
dustry.
The summary of students by
classes and by major subjects is
given below. The increase over
last year is twenty-two per cent.
The number of graduate students
has fallen off live, and there are
four less special students than in
1895-96. In the matter of major
subjects the most notable difference
is in the increased numbers in
History and the falling off in Law
and Engineering- The number
registered from California is 729 as
against 362 outside the state, show
ing a somewhat larger percentage
from California as compared with
last year. The percentage of women
has risen from 35.3 for 1895-96 to
36.6 for the present year.
