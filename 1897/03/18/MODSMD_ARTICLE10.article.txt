The privilege of going behind the
shelves in the library has been
boldly imposed upon by some of
the students. Books have been re
peatedly taken away and kept for
several days in succession, and
usually just before an examination
a time when they are most desired
by others. This underhandedness
is a species of selfishness that de
mands condemnation, and the of
fenders should be apprehended, if
possible, and access to the back of
the library denied them. The pro
fessors should see that their confi
dence is not misplaced in granting
this privilege to students.
