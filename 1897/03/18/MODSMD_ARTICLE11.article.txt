One of the most absurd out
growths of legalized prize-fighting is
the attempt to justify it hv a com
parison with football and other
sports that are legitimate and
wholesome. Even s<> venerable ;i
man as Senator Stewart of Nevada
lias forsaken his senatorial dignity
to declare that "prize-fighting is the
manliest of all sports; that football
is especially destructive of the life
and health of a. vast number of
men each year who would make
useful and honorable citizens in
the various callings in life where
education and ability are required."
This is the shabbiest nonsense.
Football arid pugilism are not at
all in the same category; they are
not engaged in fora like purpose;
they are not supported by the same
interests, nor do they appeal to the
same class of people. There is no
analogy whatever, and the effort to
decry football and boom pugilism
by placing them on a level is as fu
tile as it is ludicrous.
