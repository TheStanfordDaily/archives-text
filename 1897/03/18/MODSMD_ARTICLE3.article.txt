Rev. Dr. L. W. Munhall, the
evangelist, addressed a joint meet
ing of the Christian Associations
last evening in the chapel. He
spoke on the Bible, claiming for it
superiority as a work of literature,
as a book of philosophy, of physical
sciences, of biography, of history, of
prediction, of maxims, and for its
ethical teaching, its power, and its
harmony and unity.
