# FACULTY ATHLETICS.
## Professors Secure a Plot of Ground and Will Begin Heavy Training. 
### 
Now that Stanford has proved
that she is the equal of any univer
sity on the Coast in every branch
of athletics (except boat racing!)
the members of the faculty have
awakened to the fact that if our
supremacy is to be maintained
they too must get into line. On
the edge of the arboretum at the
right of the path leading to the
Embarcadero road they have se
lected their training grounds. Thus
far a baseball diamond and two.
tennis courts have been graded, and
the professors, unaided, with their
own hands, have erected a back
stop. Grounds and conveniences
for other sports will be arranged as
soon as occasion demands. Since
there are more crack marksmen
among the professors than experts
in any other line of sport except
baseball, it is probable that ar
rangements for trap-shooting will
be one of the next additions. Dr.
Angell, Dr. Prof. Wing
are the chief movers in this enter
prise, but the whole faculty is inter
ested in it.
The purpose of the undertaking
is two-fold, athletic and social.
Most of our professors have gone
steadily from their books to their
classrooms and from their class
rooms back to their books again.
With the exception of bicycle rid
ing which some of them partake
of, they have taken almost no out
door exercise. Besides, it is felt
that the professors living on the
campus and those living at Palo
Alto do not meet each other fre
quently enough, and it is hoped
that by means of the athletic field
the two groups may become
thoroughly united.' In time, when
the professors have developed into
expert athletes and become amal
gamated into one harmonious
whole, we may expect to see a dor
mitory rise in the corner of the ar
boretum in order t hat their athletic
spirit may be maintained and
strengthened. Then let the doughty
professors of Berkeley beware. .
