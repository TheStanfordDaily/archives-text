Among college â€¢ students there is
likely to be much disappointment!
over the session of the Legislature
just closed. Though a number of
good bills have been passed, the
work of the legislative body and
the tone of its procedure will hardly
come up to the expectations of those
of us who had hoped for something
better. The whole session has been
an almost fruitless, though costly,
experimentation, which has ended
in a mock attempt of the members'
to vindicate their incorruptible
purity by sending two newspaper j
men to jail for "peaching." We!
may hope, however, that the indue-;
tion of college men into politics will
raise the legislative standard of
honor.
