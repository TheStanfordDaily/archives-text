# Varsity Baseball.
## 
### 
The Varsity has now played live
games of baseball with outside
teams. While it is yet too soon to
judge a man by his record in bat
ting, the following table of relative
batting strength, or rather weak
ness, may prove of interest: Mc-
Laine, .444; .Jeffs, .888; Wight, .812;
Thompson, .250; Sharp, .187; C.
Strohn, .181; Young, .100; Free
man, .076; Beckett, .058; Lougheed,
.055; Murphy, .000; R. Strohn, 000.
The names of those who will play
and the position each will occupy
will probably be as follows:
Olympics: Simmons, c; Sheehan,
cf; Merrill, If; Walton, 2b; Kelley,
3b; Raymond, p; Taylor, ss; Gos
linsky, 2b; Snowden, rf.
Stanford: C. Strohn, 2b; Jeffs, c;
Wight, If; Thompson, rf; Young,
lb; Clemans, 3b; Lougheed, ss;
Freeman, cf; Beckett, p.
