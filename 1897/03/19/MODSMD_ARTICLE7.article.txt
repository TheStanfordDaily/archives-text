tiie coming year, as follows: Presi
dent, Prof. Campbell; secretary
treasurer, 1). A. Lyon, '99; execu
tive committee, Prof. Lathrop, P. B.
Anspacher, '00, and R. W. Thomp
son, '00. The evening was given
up largely to the practice of the
oratorio ''Elijah," and other selec
tions.
Mr. Maury favored the audience
with a piano solo, which was well
received. Prof. Pasmore announced
that hereafter he and Maury would
give a concert each Thursday even
ing, beginning at 7:10 and lasting
until 7:80. It is thought that this
will obviate some of the habitual
tardiness that has crept in to inter
fere with the work of the Chorus.
The work of the Chorus is pro
gressing nicely. There is, however,
an apparent lack of bass voices.
An attempt will be made during
vacation to recruit somewhat the
ranks of the singers.
