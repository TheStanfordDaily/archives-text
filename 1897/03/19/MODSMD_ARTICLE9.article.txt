During the past few weeks Prof.
Earl Barnes has been delivering a
series of lectures in San Jose. Con
cerning them, this morning's Mer
cury says editorially that "Prof.
Earl Barnes states that, although
he has delivered GOO lectures in re
cent years in all portions of the
State, he has never had so large an
audience attend his protracted se
ries of lectures as here in San Jose.
This tends to show, he says, that
San .Jose is preparing to realize her
destiny as the great intellectual
and educational center of the Pa
cific Coast. It also shows, we may
add, a keen appreciation of Prof.
Barnes' splendid ability, learning,
and fascinating method of instruc
tion."
