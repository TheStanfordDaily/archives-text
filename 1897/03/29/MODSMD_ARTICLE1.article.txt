# MADEMOISELLE TREBELLI.
## The 						Noted Prima Donna Will Sing Here Next Friday Night. 
### 
As was suggested in the Daily
Pai.o Alto just before the recess,an
effort was being made to secure
Mile. Trebelli fora concert in the
chapel. We are happy to say that
arrangements have been made for
her appearance, and that she will
appear under the auspices of the
Choral Society next Friday even
ing, April 2.
The San Francisco papers have
of late been full of eulogistic no
tices about her voice and talent,
and the unanimous opinion exists
that of all the really great singers
who have from time to time ven
tured forth to the Coast, to her
alone can be ascribed a position be
side Adelina Patti. One of the
most prominent and exacting mu
sical authorities writes of her thus:
"She is one of the few true expo
nents of the l bel canto' in all its
traditional purity. She sings mar
velously every style of music."
The most striking feature of Mile.
Trebelli's singing is the perfect
command she possesses over her
voice, which is one of exceeding
sweetness, flexibility, and power.
The most difficult passages abound
ing in runs and trills are rendered
in faultless style; the most delicate
pianissimo effects are obtained with
consummate ease.
The register of her voice is quite
exceptional, being over three oc
taves, reaching to Fin altissimo,
and throughout this extensive com
pass there is neither sign of break
nor inequality of tone. Unlike
many artists of fame, Mlle.l rebelli
comes to us in the meridian of her
powers and beauty, bright and joy
ous as a skylark.
The opportunity to hear a true
prima donna absoluta comes very
rarely, and it is not likely that it
will ever again be possible to hear
Mile. Trebelli at the low price fixed
for the concert here. She is still
young, and came for the first time
before an American audience in
San Francisco, unheralded and as
yet unknown. Her triumph in
San Francisco has been due solely
to the beauty of her singing; but
she will never again come to the
Coast as an unknown musician, but
as one of the world's famous sing
ers. She has postponed her jour
ney to the North in order to appear
here, and the chapel should be too
small to hold her audience.
Tickets will be on sale Wednes
day, Thursday, and Friday after
noons at the Registrar's office.
Price fifty cents; all seats reserved.
