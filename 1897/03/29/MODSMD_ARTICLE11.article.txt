Not two weeks remain before
the first Intercollegiate baseball
game. Yet the apathy of certain
Varsity players endanger what
little show of success Stanford has
in this sport. Day after clay goes
by with but half a team out for
practise, at a time when team work
is of the greatest importance.
â€¢ At present, it is stated, there are
but two consistent batters on the
team, and still fewer reliable run
ners. Constant practise for the
next two weeks may go far toward
remedying these defects and give
Stanford an even chance for vic
tory. Again we urge the baseball
men to play ball.
