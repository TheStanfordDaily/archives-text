# Sauta Clara vs. U.C.
## 
### 
The league game in the city Sat
urday between Santa Clara and
U. 0. was something of a farce on
account of a drizzling rain that lie-j
cessitated its postponement after
two innings, at the end of which the
score was 2to 2. After the rain ;
had ceased an exhibition game was
continued for live innings, the final
score standing 11 to 4 in favor of
U. C.
The ball was slippery and un
controllable, and there were errors,
muffed Hies, wild pitches, and j
passed balls galore. However, the J
U. C. team showed superiority in |
batting. The postponed game will!
probably be played this week.
The standing of the various
league teams is as follows:
Played. Won. Lost. Percent.
U. C. 1 1 0 1.000
Olympic 2 1 1 .500
Stanford 2 1 1 .500
Santa CI 1 0 1 .000 i
