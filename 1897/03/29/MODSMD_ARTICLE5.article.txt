# MUSICIANS' VACATION TRIP.
## First Tour of Stanford Clubs Which Ever Paid Expenses. 
### 
The Glee and Mandolin Clubs left
the campus last Wednesday after
noon fora short series of concerts
in Santa Cruz and adjacent towns.
The trip had been arranged with
the idea of reducing the debt con
tracted on the Northern trip, and
in order to secure this end the clubs
were limited to twenty-one men.
With this number, however, the
smallest yet taken by the clubs, the
debt was not only materially re
duced, but the trip was as successful
musically. With the exception of
the numbers given by Mr. Dillon,
who did not make the trip, the pro
gram was the same as that given

l»v the clubs on the tour during.the
Christmas holidays. It consisted
! of six numbers by the Glee Club,
three by the Mandolin Club, and
I four by Mr. Riley. A short ae
i count of each concert is given be
i low.

; pressed that they expressed their
intention of going on to Santa Cruz
to hear the concert. The concert
here was well attended, about
above expenses being cleared.

tertained here, a delicious dinner

being served -the clubs soon .aftfe?

ent homes. The audience at the
evening's concert,. while
large as some that theLchlbte ap-*'
peared before on the trip, was vsi>.y
appreciative and the concert pi#y.
consequently be said to be the.most.
successful musically that the clubs
have ever given. Mr... liiley/coi}i
pletely captivated the' audience.
He gave his numbers with that
ease, grace and finish which mark
the true artist and which are so,,
difficult of attainment. * The' Man
dolin Club has certainly never Ap
peared to better advantage. Ev'erv
number was played with "Binoothr,
ness and precision. "The Glefe Clttb'
was in excellent voice l and mader<S-;'
peated hits. This'"concert was
most satisfactory for both-audience '
and clubs. '■*
