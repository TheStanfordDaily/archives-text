From now until the close of the
University everything should be
full of activity and life. There is
a great deal of work remaining to
be done in every direction. Another
baseball triumph must lie added to
our list. Our first track victory
should be won. Our musical clubs
should win new laurels in the inter
collegiate concert. There are farces
to be rehearsed, and class balls to
be arranged. The next two months
must gather up all the odds and
ends of University life and stow
them away before the end of the
college year arrives. To do this
requires work, and everyone should
lend a willing hand, or else the
weight of the closing year will fall
too heavily upon a few.
