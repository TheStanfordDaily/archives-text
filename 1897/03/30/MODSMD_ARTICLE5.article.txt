# STANFORD-OLYMPIC GAME.
## Our Baseball Men Defeated by the Athletes of the City Club. 
### 
Stanford's defeat by Olympic a
w.rk ago Saturday was not an un
mixed evil. Weaknesses not clearly
seen in the contest with Santa
Clara were shown with distinctness,
and it remains for them to be rem
edied as best they may with the
material on hand.
Beckett and Snowden pitched av
erage games until the eighth in
ning, when both weakened. Olym
pic scored eight to Stanford's four
in that inning and won, 15 to 10.
Jeffs and Wight were the only
Stanford men to connect safely with
the ball more than once. The oth
ers are extremely erratic in batting.
Young and Strohn especially strike
at wild balls.
Team fielding was not bad, ex
cept in one inning, when Wight,
Jeffs, Thompson, and Sharp all
made wild throws. Young is still
weak on thrown balls. Sharp's
painful exhibition of fielding will
cause his displacement by Clemans,
at least temporarily.
The score:
OLYMPIC.
