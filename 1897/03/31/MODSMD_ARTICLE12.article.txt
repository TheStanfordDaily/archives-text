In the rush of track and baseball
work at the close of this semester
we should not lose sight of the in
tercollegiate' tennis : tournament
which will be played next month.
Although we won last year we have
no reason to becontidentof another
victory without hard work. The
tournament to choose our testm
takes place nefct week, and the
players should receive the same
support that is accorded contestants
in other University events.
