Some of the rankest specimens of
literature that have ever come to
our notice appeared in a number of
back-country newspapers during
the session of the Legislature, when
the friends of Stanford University
were endeavoring to relieve its
property from burdensome taxa
tion, With no apparent purpose
but to keep as far as possible from
the truth, these petty scriblers have
attacked the University, defaming
its founders and attempting t<>
cast reproach upon any system of
education better than the primary
A B C which marked the close of
theirown intellectual development.
This sort of thing'harms the Uni
versity in a way, because it reaches
many who have no means of know
ing the truth. But it would be use
less to answer the criticisms, it is use
less even to attempt to secure a
hearing: because we are handi
capped from the start by th'e blind
insanity which the authors of them
possess.
