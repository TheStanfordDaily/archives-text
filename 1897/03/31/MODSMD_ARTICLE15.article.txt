President McNeil of the Stanford
Tennis Club today answered the
letter of President Code of the Ber
keley club stating that it would be
impossible for the club here to play
Berkeley on the 3d and 10th of
April as requested. Freeman, on
account of baseball work, has done
no tennis work whatever, and the
bad weather has prevented holding
the preliminary tournaments. April
24, the intercollegiate tield-day,
and May 1 were suggested by Presi
dent McNeil as satisfactory to the
players here.
The regular spring tournament
for the selection of representatives
for the intercollegiate meet will be
held next week. Drawings will be
made this week.
