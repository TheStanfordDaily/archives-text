# LAST NIGHT'S LECTURE.
## Dr. Jordan Speaks of the "Fur Seal as an International Issue." 
### 
The large house which always
•.-nets President Jordan's lectures
awaited him last evening on the
occasion of the stereoptican lecture
on the '' Kur seal as an international
issue."
It was President Jordan's first
appearance since his return from
Washington, so he remarked in he
ginning that he was "glad to get
hack on terra Jirvia once more."
The affairs of the University, he
said, are all right and steadily im
proving.
After a description of the habits
of the fur seal and of the methods
of capture, Dr. Jordan spoke of the
companies that have been organized
and chartered to kill seals in Alas
kan waters. When pelagic sealing
was started in 1880 the United
States protested against it and
sought the aid of England to pro
tect the herds. This led to the
sending out of a commission of
which Dr. Merriam and Dr. Men
denhall were the members for the
American government. The re
ports of the British and American
commisioners were laid before the
Paris tribunal of arbitration. The
United States government claimed
the ownership of the animals and
maintained that what was neces
sary to preserve the herds was the
prohibition of killing on land.
The British commissioners denied
all these claims, but gave no evi
dence to support their own position.
The tribunal knew nothing of the
fur seal or of the islands, so it made
a farcical attempt at arbitration
which amounted merely to a com
promise. They made no attempt
to find out the absolute justice of
the case, but decided ii on legal
precedents alone.
The tribunal decided that the
United States did not own Bering
Sea or the animals on the rook
eries. Its regulations and recom
mendations, however, amounted to
nothing. The judgment of the
body was written by one of the
clerks and meant very little.
One article of its findings pro
vided for a re-examination every
live years, and it was this that led
to the commissions of 1896, sent
out by both countries. The matter
is now approaching settlement, and
the two governments are likely to
come to an agreement which shall
absolutely prohibit pelagic sealing.
This is the only way the female
seals can be protected.
A large number of lantern slides
were shown at the conclusion of the
lecture.
