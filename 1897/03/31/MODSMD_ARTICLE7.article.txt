# How She Sings.
## 
### 
Much has been said and written
concerning Mile. Trebelli's voice.
Her appearance in San Francisco
was a great success, and the critics
assigned her a very high rank.
Her voice is a soprano of extraordi
nary range and power, the tones of
which are rich and dulcet and at 1
once captivate the ear by their
sweetness. Her execution is simply
perfection. She shines above all in
fioriture and the ornaments of vo
calization. Passages the most in
tricate, caprices the most varied,
and roulades the most startling, of
fer no obstacle to the marvellous fa
cility of her throat. Her perform
ances are clear, every note receives
its full value, never breathless and
never heavy. Each group of notes
is expressed and divided with
as much precision and artistic
thought as the greatest of violin
ists exhibits in his bowing, and
this is all achieved free from
triclc and affectation. There is no
perceptible effort in her singing;
the fair artist transposes herself
into the situation and breathes the
life and spirit of the subject she
portrays. Her principle charac
teristic is expression, from its lofti
est epic flight down to the senti
mental and coquettish. Her reper
toire is of great versatility. She
naturally prefers the classical
school, but is as much at home in
lyric singing as when rendering the
great masterpieces.
This will be her only appearance
here as she leaves California very
soon. The concert is under the
auspices of the Stanford Choral So
ciety, Friday evening, April 2,
tickets fifty cents.
