# TALES FROM THE LAND OF OC.
## Prof. Brun's Book Elicits Praise From the English-Speaking World. 
### 
Ever since the appearance of the
Tales of Languedoc, press notices
have been constantly appearing
both here and abroad commending
the work in the most unstinted
terms. No doubt the fact that the
introduction to the book was from
the pen of so famous a writer as
Harriet \\\ Preston served to a
very considerable extent to draw
attention to the tales; but that fact
alone can not account for the many
favorable comments which have
been passed upon it by the critics.
\\'e have selected a few of these
press notices at random from a
hook of clippings kindly loaned to
us by Mr. Doxey:
"We can fancy the French of
these tales to be generally charul
ing. So far, however, as a transla
tion may supply the original, Mr.
Brun has been happily successful.
The general form is purely literary,
and the style such as will command
for those Provencal traditions a
place with the best ot literary folk
lore." —Los Angeles Times.
"The book is a real contribution to
our knowledge of the life and
thought, the language, and tradi
tions of the South of France. . .
In a sense they have many resem
blances to the German tales,
or to the Danish tales, . . but
the spirit of the South has given
them a picturesqueness of their
own, and the manner in which they
are here told suggests the character
istics of the language from which
they are derived." —Philadelphia
Times.
"We do not believe that anybody
can read these delightful stories
without feeling their sweet and
wholesome influence." — Chicago
Evening Post.
"This is an altogether delightful
book, and we hope some enterpris
ing publisher may presently give
us an English edition of it. The
copy in our hands conies from far
San Francisco. ... A charm
ing set of tales they make. In
their general features they remind
us of our Brothers Grimm, but al
ways with a difference, a pleasant
difference, a difference of atmos
phere. Like Grimm, the folk-tales
of Languedoc are resolutely opti
mistic; hope springs eternal in
them. They are one and all de
lightful, ami the manner of their
telling, with its comical mixture of
shrewdness and simplicity, is de
lightful too." —London Chronicle.
"The tales are happy, entertain
ing, and are beautifully illustrated."
—New Orleans Times Democrat.
"Quaint superstitions follow pre
posterous incidents in large num
bers, and thrilling situations, be
side which those of Andersen and
Grimm seem commonplace, are
painted with so much dramatic
power and wholesome humor that
they prove irresistible. . . . The
Pacific Coast has done Southern
France a service in collecting such
a pleasant set of fireside tales for
the enjoyment of English readers."
—Boston Journal.
"Mr. S. J. Brun is to the manner
born, the book which he has writ
ten out on these pages being an in
heritance. . . There are nine of

them, and excellent of their kind
they are; not exactly fairy stories,
not exactly legends, certainly not
allegories, but a sort of French
Arabian Nights tales, improbable
always, of course, if not impossible,
but full of quaint and sometimes
grotesque fancy, and appealing
strongly to the imagination. Har
riet W. Preston is just the one to
write the introduction, familiar as
she is with the field and its litera
ture."—Boston Literary World.
'"In this exquisite book of fairy
tales Mr. Brun has given us some
thing new, valuable, and entertain
ing in literature." — Washington
Post.
"Not since reading Grimm and
Andersen has any book so recalled
the childhood days, nor since those
books does it seem that any collec
tion of tales for children has
reached the merit of this. The ad
ventures are thrilling, the villains
are black, the heroes wondrous fair,
the fun is real, and the air of real
ity is stamped upon every story.
. . ." —Hartford Post.
" . .' The material of these
folk stories is unhackneyed,and the
illustrations by Peixotto convey an
air of foreign grandeur to the
courtly news. . ."—Sunday Or
egonian.
''They are such wonderful and
beautiful stories, these adventures
from time past, and they teach such
improving lessons, or they are so
frankly purposeless. And over
them all is such a spirit of poetry,
such romance. Moreover, the lit
erary value of the work is high in
deed, while its artistic value is
quite as great."— Kansas City
Times.
"A work more acceptable, more
unique, more charming, does not
often find its way to the reviewer's
desk." —Toledo Sunday Journal.
"The Tales of Languedoc told by
Prof. S. J. Brun of Lei and Stan
ford Jr. University have the quali
ties that make folk-lore endure
from generation to generation.
These tales of the Land of Oc will
be found of great charm to chil
dren; but their elders may well and
profitably read them and give them
a little place beside "The Reds of
the Nudi," as part of the literature
of Provence, which has so forcibly
and quickly won the attention of
students of letters in all parts of
the world." —The Critic, New York.
"There are nine stories in all,
and, with few exceptions, we ven
ture to offer the opinion that most
of them will live in the classic.
Mr. Brun, in his preface, disclaims
all intention of reaching any stand
ard of scientific or literary value in
his book, but the student of my
thology or folk-lore may be allowed
to decide that point for himself,
and limited as the work is, yet we
believe that it will be enduring."—
San Francisco News-Letter.
