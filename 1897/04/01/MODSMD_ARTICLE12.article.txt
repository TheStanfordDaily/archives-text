The rare opportunity of hearing
one of the greatest vocal artists is
given the students in the appearance
of Mile. Trebelli at the chapel tomor
row evening. There have been so
few musical entertainments on the
campus this year that this concert
is anticipated with great pleasure
by all music lovers. It is so seldom
that the world's great artists come
so far West that a musical treat
such as is offered to-morrow even
ing by Mile. Trebelli should be
well attended and appreciated.
