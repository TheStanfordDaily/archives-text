# FIELD DAY NEXT SATURDAY.
## Annual University Handicap on Track and Field on Our Campus. 
### 
Next Saturday everybody wants
u» go over to the track and size up
our men. Manager Brown has ar
ranged fora handicap field-day
open to everybody in the Univer
sity. A few of the best men in the
Lowell High School will also come
down to compete.
This will be the first University
field-day held 011 our track this
year, and the last. It will be the
only time that our men come to
gether as a team this year before
the U. C.-Stii"furd games, and will
afford the only opportunity to see
them in competition. For these
reasons it is hoped that the bleach
ers will be well filled.
Trainer King has finished most
of the heavy training of the team
and most of the men are in pretty
good condition, so that from what
is done 011 next Saturday we can
form somewhat of an opinion of
our strength in the different events.
The order of events is the same
as that of the Intercollegiate lield
day this year and the management
promises to have tlieni run off
smoothly. If there is a big crowd
out with a little football enthusiasm
to urge 011 the runners it seems not
improbable that several new college
records may be established. At
least half a dozen are in danger,
those in the hurdles, the hammer
throw, the hundred, two-twenty,
and quarter. The handicaps will
insure close and exciting finishes.
The money taken will go toward
providing a training table the last
two weeks, for which there is not
as yet any money on hand. We
all realize the necessity of a train
ing table for at least a few days be
fore the contest, and as there seems
some danger that the money for it
will not be forthcoming, this is
another reason why everybody
should turn out and pack the grand
stand.
The men have trained hard and
faithfully this year and have been
handicapped by much bad weather
and lack of funds, but through
Trainer King's efforts they are
rapidly getting into form. Noth
ing will develop them so fast as
genuine contests with cheering
spectators urging them on.
