From San Francisco a gentleman
has written to the Palo Alto Live
Oak criticising Regent Rogers of
the University of California for an
address made at the laying of the
corner stone of the Affiliated Col
leges. The speaker is reported to
have said:
"We appreciate the excellence of
the work and influence of many of
the other independent collegiate in
stitutions in the state. In time
they will recognize the high mis
sion of the State University in or
ganizing all her educational forces
and will seek closer affiliation with
us whether they are situated in Los
Angeles, Napa, or Santa Clara.
"But some of the pretended col
leges of the state do not deserve
this rank. They should be com
pelled to assume their true grade of
academies or high schools. When
our people appreciate better what a

college should be, and the economic
and stimulating advantages of a
harmonious system of education,
they will by law prohibit the as
sumption of collegiate or other ad
vanced educational rank by any
institution until so accredited by
the University of the stale."
In other words, says the corres
pondent, in the opinion of the
speaker every non-affiliated ed
ucational institution should be
placed under the censorship of
the State University, and com
pelled to assume the grade
of academies or high schools, until
it pleases the governing body of
the State University to permit it to
assume higher pretentions —the
object being to establish a "har
monious system of education."
The correspondent then g.ies on
as follows:
"The speaker does not by express
words include the Leland Stanford
Jr. University as among the num
ber he would prescribe, but what
other university is there in the
state that offers any serious com
petition to the State University,
and why, if the State University is
correct in the principles that guide
it, should it seek to place any other
educational institution under its
censorship? 'Our people' do now,
we think, appreciate that the grad
uates of our colleges should be
fitted to fill some place in practical
life, and that a college education
should and could be made equal to
a practical business education, thus
enabling the graduates, before ar
riving at the meridian of life, to
have and enjoy that which would
otherwise take most of a lifetime to
attain. Such were the ideas of
Senator Stanford. The 'harmon
ious system of education' suggested
by the speaker brings to our minds
the system in vogue not many
years ago when thought and every
thing else was under a censorship
in the interest of absolute govern
ment. Is it desirable that we
should return to that system?"
