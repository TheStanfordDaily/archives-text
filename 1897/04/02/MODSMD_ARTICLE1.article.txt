# TOMORROW'S CONTESTS.
## Our Track Athletes Will Set the Pace Toward an Intercollegiate Victory. 
### 
The sixth annual Stanford field
day will he held on the oval tomor
row afternoon beginning at two
o'clock.
In order to put the more exper
ienced men to the test and to insure
close contests, handicaps have been
arranged as indicated in the entries
for the different events printed in
their order below.
Jn addition to much compara
tively untried college material
there will be a number of the hest
young athletes of the San Fran
cisco Lowell High School pitted
against the scratch men that are at
present recognized as probable
leaders in the events they are en
tered for.
Among the visitors from the
Lowell High School are Walsh,
captain of his team and a remark
ably speedy, stylish little walker,
who, if in good form, will likely go
his mile under 7:30; and Symmes,
captain of the never-defeated Y. M.
C. A. lightweight football team
that has never once been defeated
in its thirty-six games played dur
ing the last three years. Young
Walsh is under the medium height
and of fragile build. This is only
his second year on the track, but
he is constantly improving in
speed. Lately lie has tried the
mile run also and with fair pros
pects. He will probably enter
Stanford next year or the year fol
lowing.
