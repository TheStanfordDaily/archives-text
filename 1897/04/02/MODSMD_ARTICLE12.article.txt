The members of the debating
societies are to be congratulated on
the success of the inter-society de
bates. More interest is taken in
these inter-society contests than is
ordinarily given to regular society
meetings, as much more interest is
manifested by the members of the
societies and longer time is spent
in preparation for the debates. In
these meetings an opportunity is
afforded for criticism by members
of the faculty and others who may
be in a position to know more
about the defects of the speakers
than are the members of the
societies themselves.
