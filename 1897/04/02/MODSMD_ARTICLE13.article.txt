This morning's Chronicle is
authority in its Berkeley correspond
ence f«>r the statement that Holiert
I\dgren, the hammer-thrower, has
gone Kast and will not represent
the University of California in the
coining intercollegiate field-day.
It seems that ''a load was lifted
from the Berkeley conscience when
Manager Barnes announced this
afternoon that Mob Kdgren, the
hammer-thrower, had gone Wast,"
for "of late a decided sentiment had
arisen against allowing Kdgren to
figure in the field day, partly be

cause of Stanford's objections and
partly because of the fact that vic
tory over Stanford without him
would give the cardinal no ground
for complaint." This is at once
good news and a confession on
Berkeley's part that Edgren, news
paper artist and reporter on the
Examiner, with a nominal connec
tion with the University of Califor
nia's affiliated Art School, was not
strictly speaking a representative
collegian. Jt means that where
Berkeley was sure of five points
from Edgren's performance Stan
ford will probabl)' take these live
points through the efforts of Ilaz
zard. I'pon this change alone the
result of the field-day may hinge.
Edgren, ii is said, has been trans
ferred to Hearst's New York Jour
nal, his work in illustrating the
transcontinental relay and the
Carson fight having brought him
recognition.
