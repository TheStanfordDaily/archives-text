# Berkeley Football Coach.
## 
### 
The 1897 football team of the
University of California will be
coached by Charles P. Nott, at pres
ent an instructor in botany in the
University. This selection is a de
parture from the policy of former
managements in securing coaches
from the East.
Mr. Nott captained the Brown
team of 1895-96, playing tackle.
He was picked as a substitute on
Caspar Whitney's All-American
team of that season. Last season
he ably assisted Buttersvorth in
coaching the Berkeley team. He
is exceedingly popular with the
football men and the students in
general.
