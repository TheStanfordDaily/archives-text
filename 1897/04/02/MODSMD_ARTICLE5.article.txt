# Santa Clara Wins.
## 
### 
Santa Clara defeated U. C. in an
interesting game of baseball on the
campus yesterday. Santa Clara
scored three times in the fourth in
ning on a base on balls, an error by
King, and hits by Fleming and
Sage. In the seventh they added
two more on Wheeler's and King's
errors and Bride's single. Califor
nia's only runs were scored in the
ninth on hard hitting by Kaars
burg, Krug, Hoag, and McLaren.
Kelly's steadiness in the box was
the main cause of Santa Clara's
victory. Up to the last inning he
allowed but three scattering hits.
He gave his fielders twelve chances
on fly balls, and struck out Hen
nessey at critical moments King's
sensational catches in the outfield
cut off more than one run. Bride,
Conner, and indeed the whole team,
deserve much credit.
The U. C. team was not consti
tuted exactly as it will be in the
intercollegiate series, so no predic
tions as to the result of that series

can well be made. Their batting
strength was not such as was an
ticipated, but the rally in the ninth
inning gave hint of possibilities be
yond the Stanford team in its pres
ent shape. As last year, their field
ing weakness lies to the left of the
diamond and behind the bat. The
pitchers of both sides are an un
known quantity in a championship
game.
The four league teams are now
tied, each having lost and won one
game.
The score:
SANTA CLARA.
