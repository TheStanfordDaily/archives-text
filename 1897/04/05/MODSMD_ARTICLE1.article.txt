## Stanford's Winning- Athletes Make and Break Records in Saturday's Games. 
### 
The try-out field-day last Saturt
day was in many respects the mos
successful and encouraging ever
held on our campus. A good sized
audience was present, and hoth the
weather and the arrangements of
the managers were very satisfactory.
The 100-yard stretch was fast, hut
the track as a whole was in many
places soft and slow.
Five college records were broken:
the 100-yard, the quarter, the 120-
vard hurdle, the pole-vault, and
the hammer-throw.
The most noteworthy feature of
the day was Brim ton's running.
In his first heat in the hundred he
was pocketed by the handicap men
or his time would very likely have
been 10 seconds. In the final of
the hundred he had to yell to Evans
and Karsted at the 75-yard mark
to get out of his way. Johnnie
buret through between them as if
they were standing still, and fin
ished in one of the most wonderful
spurts ever witnessed on the (Joast.
The wind was blowing directly
down the stretch in this race and
undoubtedly aided the runner
somewhat. This does not detract
from the merit of the performance,
as the time caught can be made by
a racer only in the very first class.
Brunton's time of 51 3-5 seconds
in the 440 also makes a new Stan
ford record, the old one being 52
1-5. This performance was even
better than the shorter dash, as a
great part was against a strong
wind.
The mile walk was won by Walsh
of the Lowell High School in the
fast time of 7:45. Considering the
wind the time is exceedingly fast
Young Walsh walked in excellent
form from start to finish, and
doubtless has a career ahead of
him. He was a great favorite with
the crowd, being continually ap
plauded during bis performance.
Coffin, who holds the Coast record
for this event, thinks that, the high
school lad will one day make a
good mark. Adams, '98, came in
second in good form. lie has in
him the making of a good walker.
Morgan's time of 15 4-5 seconds
in the 120-yard hurdle race was ex
ceedingly good. His time in the
220-yard hurdle was hardly 27 sec
onds, as he beat the pistol at the
start. He showed lack of training
for this event, but is excusable on
account of recent illness.
In spite ot a lame knee, Dole,
who always shows up well in com
petition, beat his record in the pole
vault, clearing 10 feet 11 inches.
Fickert showed up surprisingly
well in the weights, winning both
the hammer and the shot. For the
past two or three weeks he has
been practising very steadily. As
a result he broke the college record
of 126.6 feet by throwing the big
hammer nearly 128 feet.
Some of the new men made a
good showing, notably, Karsted and
Polhemus in the sprints, Daggett
and Arnold in the half, Higgles in
the quarter, and Hopper in the
broad jump. Pope's great im
provement in the hurdles is a mat
ter of congratulation. Last season
he was not able to run them

through. His best time Saturday
was close to 17 seconds.
The high jump was not regu
larly competed, on account of the
inability of Kerrigan, Morgan, Dole,
and Boyd to take part.
The Lowell High School men
showed themselves to he worthy
competitors, their mile-walker and
their distance men, in particular,
doing good work.

who always shows up well in com
petition, beat his record in the pole
vault, clearing 10 feet 11 inches.
Fickert showed up surprisingly
well in the weights, winning both
the hammer and the shot. For the
past two or three weeks he has
been practising very steadily. As
a result he broke the college record
of 126.6 feet by throwing the big
hammer nearly 128 feet.
Some of the new men made a
good showing, notably, Karsted and
Polhemus in the sprints, Daggett
and Arnold in the half, Higgles in
the quarter, and Hopper in the
broad jump. Pope's great im
provement in the hurdles is a mat
ter of congratulation. Last season
he was not able to run them

through. His best time Saturday
was close to 17 seconds.
The high jump was not regu
larly competed, on account of the
inability of Kerrigan, Morgan, Dole,
and Boyd to take part.
The Lowell High School men
showed themselves to he worthy
competitors, their mile-walker and
their distance men, in particular,
doing good work.
