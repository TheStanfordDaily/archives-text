Some time we hope to see here
the establishment of an alumni
weekly. A paper of this kind (ills
a place in college literature that
can hardly be reached by a daily
giving news only, nor by a weekly
devoted to the literary productions
of the students. It occupies a
unique position between the two,
being designed for the great body
of alumni who have left their Uni
versity, and who still want to keep
in touch with its yearly history and
progress-.
The number of the Stanford
alumni are too few to support
such an enterprise now, but with
each succeeding year's addition to
the alumni ranks, the time should
not be very far distant when we
can have this most, welcome addi
tion to the list of Stanford publica
tions.
