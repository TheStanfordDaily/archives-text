# THE 						TREBELLI CONCERT.
## Musical Program of Much Merit Enjoyed by a Large Audience. 
### 
The chapel was filled last Friday
evening by the audience gathered
;o hear Mile. Antoinette Trebelli.
1 hose who attended were amply
rewarded by the singing of this ac
complished soprano and by the
work of her assistants.
Mile. Trebelli's voice is lacking
in that distinction of quality which
makes the really great voice and
which made the voice of her more
fatuous mother so remarkable; but
it is a fine voice, distinguished by
beauty and warmth of tone, purity,
and flexibility. Indeed, it would
be difficult to praise her singing too
highly when we consider the beauty
of her conceptions, her admirable I
phrasing, and her refined and ar
tistic sentiment.
Her tirst number was the well
known aria and scene from Verdi's
opera "La Traviata," the long, dra-i
mafic recitative, which serves as aj
prelude, being included. The tech-j
nical execution of the difficult pas
sages, especially the trying staccato
roulades and the extremely florid
arpeggi, was astonishingly success
ful. The lovely aria with its pro
nounced cantabile movement was
given with marked expressive
power, purity of intonation, and
finely-cut, well-rounded phrasing.
The fourth number, "Dear Bird of
Winter," by (Janz, gave still fur
ther opportunity fora display of
colorature singing that is ali the
more remarkable when one consid
ers her success in the broad, legato
passages. For an encore she sang
a dramatic song, of the modern
German school, with much depth of
feeling. Her rendition of Auber's
noted "Laughing Song," which she
also gave as an encore, was ad
mirable for the refined manner in
which it was sung, in spite of the
rather broad though very success
ful realism. While Mile. Trebelli's
voice is at times of a, decidedly in
cisive and penetrating quality, yet
it is always agreeable and beauti
ful.
Mrs. Edith Scott Basford has
been heard at the University sev
eral times before. She has an un
common voice, and she is one of
the few contralti who refrain from
forcing their lower notes. Some of
her middle notes have a decided
dramatic quality, her lower notes
are always sonorous, but the upper
part of her voice is at times hollow
and weak. She sang the recitative
and aria by Handel with the no
bility and simplicity of sentiment
which the music of that composer
demands for its adequate interpre
tation.
Miss Helle Rosenthal is a violin
ist of considerable promise. Her
first number, by De Beriot, whose
showy music is so much affected by
violinists of the French school,
served as a medium for her to dis
play a fair technical accomplish
ment. The lyric movements, while
lacking in the requisite fervor, were
given with notable sincerity, which
is a quality as admirable as if is
rare. The passage for the (i string
in Godard's ' Berceuse'' calls fora
breadth of tone and bowing which
as vet is not at her command. But
her playing was always agreeable

by reason of the sincerity and in
telligence of her intention.
Mr. 11. B. Pasmore also sang two
numbers, and Mile. Trebelli gave
one of his own songs.
â€¢The accompaniments played by
Mr. F. Marrion were among the
most pleasant features of the con
cert.
