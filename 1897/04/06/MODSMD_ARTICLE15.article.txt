Student body enthusiasm at tin*
University of California has re
sulted in the adoption of a plan
for adding another graduate
scholarship of two hundred and
fifty dollars to the number with
which California is already en
dowed. The money for the sup
port of ibis scholarship is to be
raised by an assessment on the
whole body <>112 students. Such en
thusiasm of the kind which results
in material benefits is valuable.
While we can not hope for any sim
ilar action on the part of the stu
dents at Stanford, who are already
overburdened with a debt and in
addition have become the brunt of
numerous subscriptions, yet more
of the spirit which accompanied
this gift of the U. C. students might
be manifested among us. In the
fut.ire, perhaps, when the student
body debt is reduced to 1 M >t 11 i " J-T,
we may look to the Stanford stu
dents for the endowment of a
scholarship.
