chapel last Saturday evening. The

will take place in two weeks. At

Aside from the interest awakened
by the contest for tin? inter-society
championship, these inter-society
meetings are exceedingly valuable
to all interested in debating or pub
lic speaking on account of the ex
ceedingly able criticisms given by
members of the faculty present at

the meetings. Saturday night
Profs. Ross and Lathrop both gave
very interesting talks upon some of
our defects in debating.
