# Chapel Sermon.
## 
### 
The sermon Sunday morning in
the chapel was preached by Rev.
Geo. C. Adams, D. D., of the First
Congregational Church of San
Francisco, lie spoke of the Greek
and Hebrew philosophies and their
holding out against the reception
of Jesus. The Stoics and Epicu
reans looked upon the whole sub
ject from the standpoint of philos
ophy; they tried to reason il out.
The Hebrews on the other hand
were the most practical in their at
titude; they viewed the coming of
| the new religion from a commer
cial standpoint. Rome at this
| time was at the lowest point of civ
ilization ever reached by any na
tion; their watchword was "Rread
and gains:" the coliseum rang with
plaudits of the multitude when
blood flowed. When Christ came,
however, he uttered something the
world had never before heard: "A
; new commandment 1 give unto you
that ye love one another." So
while the Jew was looking fora
sign that should tell him this was
, the Christ, he could not see the
; signs that were already given; he
was blinded by his own prejudice'.
Thus it is we look at things from
our own standpoint, and are
clouded by our own doubt and prej
j udice. A great many times in the
! world's history men have missed
the truth by very little.
