# NEXT YEAR'S ANNUAL.
## "Sophomore" Proposes a New Plan for Electing the "Quad's" Editorial Staff. 
### 
The following communication
has been received from a member
jof the Class of '99 in regard to the
I coming election of an editor and
| staff for next year's Junior Annual:
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
As the '99 Annual election is
near at hand a suggestion as to the
1 manner of choosing the editors of
I that book might be in order. It
! seems that the system of electing
the board by vote of the class has
not worked for the best results. In
; several cases very grave faults have
been detected, while in several spe
cific instances men of much ability
have been defeated in election and
incompetents have succeeded in be
ing elected. Might it not be better
if the editor were allowed the power
of appointing the men who are to
be his associates and aids in the
; year's work?
It is true that this is quite a de
parture from established methods,
but it can be shown to be the best
. plan. One man, if he has the good
| sense and discretion that is pre
sumed in him when he is elected,
will be more able to choose the best
i literary talent in the class than will
the class as a whole. Again, an ed
itor should be allowed to choose
men who are to work with him. In
this way he will get a congenial
: board, one that is not liable to
those quibbles and dissensions
| which might prove fatal to the
work engaged in. Might it not at
i least be well for the president of the
i class to appoint a committee to
! look into this with other Annual
matters and report to a meeting of
I the class? Sophomoke.
