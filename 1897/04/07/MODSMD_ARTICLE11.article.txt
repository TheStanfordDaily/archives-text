The managers of the University
of California track team are milk
ing a strenuous effort to change the
system of counting which lias here
tofore governed the intercollegiate
meet. Under this system, which is
used almost universally and which
has heen in use ever since Berkeley
and Stanford first exchanged ath
letic courtesies, first places count
live points, second places two

points, and third places one point.
Berkeley wishes to have second
places count three points, thus
raising the standard so as to ena
ble her to capture the field-day,
even though her first-rate men may
be few in number. That such a
change should never have been
thought of until now is surprising
to say the least. Manager Dave
Brown will doubtless be able to
hold Berkeley to the old agreement.
