# Honor System at Princeton.
## 
### 
At l'rinceton the honor system
of examinations has prevailed for
some time, and heen found a suc
cess. The Daily J'rincetonian re
cently preached a little sermon on
the subject:
u ln view of the approaching ex
aminations, we have deemed it
timely to call attention to the honor
system in conducting them, which
had its organization at Princeton,
and has proven so successful in its
practical workings. We assume
that all men who have heen at
Princeton for some time understand
the spirit and workings of the sys
tem, and therefore it is to those
who.take these examinations here
for i he lirst time, that these remarks
are applicable. Several years ago
the Princeton undergraduates, as
sembled in mass meeting, decided
to place the college examinations
on a much higher plane than that
on which they had formerly rested,
and to this end they declared that
henceforth every undergraduate
should be put on his honor, and at.
the close of each examination should
pledge his honor as a gentleman
that he had neither given or received
assistance of any sort. Further
more it was declared to be the duty
of any student who should be the
witness of any cheating to report
the same to the undergraduate
committee. This committee was
commissioned to act upon such
cases presented to it and report
their action to the faculty for con
firmation. T he system has been
given a thorough trial, and has not
been found wanting. We wish all
new men to understand that this
is the position Princeton has taken
on this important matter; that the
rules laid down for conducting ex
aminations are fully in force, and

are backed by the united senti
tnent of the undergraduate body.
The position of Princeton is the
same today as it was when this
step was taken, and in no respect
do we propose to retreat from the
stand taken then. Sometimes there
have been one or two men whose
sense of honor has been so low that
they have cheated. Though no
one is in the least expected to act
as a spy or monitor over his fellow
students, yet if any case should
come to his notice, it is his duty,
without any personal consideration
whatsoever, to report the matter to
the student committee." —Bachelor
