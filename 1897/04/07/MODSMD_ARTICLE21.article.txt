Thi«: (ilee jind Mandolin Clubs
w ill appear in the chapel next Fri
day night, )>r«>l >mI»ly for tlie last
time this semester. All those who
have not listened to a concert by
these clubs this year should make
it a point to hear them on this oc
casion. The value of these musical
organizations to the University is
something not to be lost sight of,
and they should be given at least
as much encouragement, at home as
they receive abroad.
