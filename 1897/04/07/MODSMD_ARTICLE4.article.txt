# A 						Lecture on Railroading.
## 
### 
Mr. Bealian of the Engineering
department and an ex-railroad j
man lectured before the class in
Transportation this morning on
"The relation between railroading
and economics." He made the I
point that railioading was a sci
ence and that laws governing rates'
for freights and fares should be;
founded on common sense rather j
than sentiment. He showed that
roads such as the Central Pacific,,
which are built over mountains i
with steep grades, must necessarily!
receive a higher rate for service i
than those roads which have no
grades to overcome.
Mr. Bealian delivered a glowing
eulogy to the memory of .lay Gould,
whom he described as honest in all
commercial transactions and a de
voted parent and husband. In
conclusion he said that everything
at present tended toward a more
harmonious relation between rail
roads and the people and a satis
factory adjustment of all their |
grievances.
