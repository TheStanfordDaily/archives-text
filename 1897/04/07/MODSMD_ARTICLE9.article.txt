### 
Much sentiment litis been aroused
among the universities of the
country over that clause of the
Dinglev Tariff Hill which places a
tax of twenty-live per cent, ad va
lorem on all hooks imported into
the United States, and a t;ix of
forty per cent, on all scientific in
strumentP, preparations, and ap
pliances. Under the Wilson Hill
the tax on books applied only to
those printed in English, while
there was no prohibition on the im
portation of materials for scientific
study.
Harvard, Yale, Cornell, the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, and Co
lumbia have made a vigorous pro
test against the measure through
their alumni in Congress. Presi
dent .Jordan also made a formal
protest on behalf of Stanford. The
greater part of the chemical and
physical apparatus used here is im
ported direct from Germany, as are
also a large number of books each
year. To levy an import duty on
these articles might look well from
thestandpointof national financier
ing,but it would seriousl) cripple the
progress of science and education
in this country.
The bill has passed the House,
but has not yet come up in the
Senate.
