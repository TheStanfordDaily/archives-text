Some time ago there appeared in
this column a statement to I In* ef
fect that the recent success of the
musical clubs was a justilication of
the policy of ha viug these organiza
tions under student body control.
While this, might well he main
tained, it hardly gives the clubs
credit for the excellent work they
have done. Never before has then
been such faithful devotion to re
hearsals, nor ever before have the
members gone into the work with
so much spirit and enthusiasm as
they have shown this year. Once
in debt they have worked steadily
to clear off their obligations and are
now almost free from debt. The
students should show their appre
ciation of this by turning out to
give the clubs a rousing reception
at their final appearance tomorrow
night.
