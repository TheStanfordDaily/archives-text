Puohablv no idea is so common ly
associated with the word "Univer
sity" us that of the use of hooks.
That it should U* so is mi t lira I
enough, for they are the constant
companion of the student through
out Ins four years of college life.
They are the tools which make his
work possible, and are indispensa
ble whatever may he the career
which one adopts. The importance
of this use is universally recognized,
and yet there our interest slops.
While no one would think of turn
ing students loose into a laboratory
without some suggestions as to the
use of instruments and the meaning
of scientific investigation, the stu
dent who has never had an oppor
tunity of seeing fifty hooks together
in his life before, on coming to the
U nversity is thrown all at once
into contact with thousands of vol
umes and is given no guide, help,
or assistance.
The result of this is that few < 112
the students whose work is so in
tiinately connected with the library
ever achieve a mastery of that con
spi( uoits part of it known as the
"reference books." It is to supply
;i general introduction to the me of
b oks—especially books of refer
ence and bibliographies, which
arc the keys to the literature of eub
ji c s —that the course announced
m the new Register is designed.
It is intended that the work of the
course shall be carried out directly
in connection with the University
library. A part will he devoted to
instruction in the preparation of
bibliographies. These features of
the course should make it, extremely
valuable, especially to incoming
siudents.
