" The fact is the Lecture Asso
ciation gave us two shows in one.
Mr. Hi lev is a show of and in him
self. He is an original and very
excellent comedian who has got the
world he moves in laughing at his
heels.''—Santa Cruz Daily Penny
Pretw.
"Frank Branch Hiley, a natural
horn comedian, made the hit of the
evening. Let him adopt the stage
as a profession and he will make
more money than he can in a col
lege professorship. In recitation
or song he is equally at home."—
Santa Cruz Daily Sentinel.
"From the opening chorus to the
fall of the curtain each.number was
received with applause. The jolly
college songs in chorus and the
mandolin and guitar selections
were a treat to hear. Mr. Frank
B. Bile}' demonstrated his ability
as a clever mimic and the audience
could not see too much of him.
There is a certain indescribable
charm connected with the songs
and selections of these students that
make them favorites wherever they
go."—(i i lroy Advocate.
