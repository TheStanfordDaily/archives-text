Thk student body assessment
fund has been largely contributed
by the young men this year. In
previous years the young women
have been very prompt in paying
tbis small fee, and in recognition
of their help the management of
the student body atone time volun
tarily presented several rustic
benches for use at Itoble gymnas
ium This year on the contrary
the young women have not re
sponded at all generously in spite
of the fact that the Women's Ath
letic Association received the ap
propriation asked for early in the
year. While the sole purpose of
supporting this fund should not be
alone the expectation of receiving a
direct appropriation from it, it is
unreasonable for the young women
to accept the same without being
willing to do their part toward in
creasing the student body revenues.
The small membership fees of. the
Women's Athletic Association are
not sufficient to keep tip the ex
penses, and if the association flour
ishes, help from some other source
must be obtained. It is manifestly
a better plan for the young women
to pay the student body fee and se
cure support from thisorganization
than to increase the Athletic Asso
ciation fees. A more lively inter
est should be taken in this matter
by the young ladies, and all should
be willing to assist as far as possi
ble in a work so important to the
women of the University.
