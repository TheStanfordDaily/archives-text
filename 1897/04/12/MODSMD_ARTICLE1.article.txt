# STANFORD VICTORIOUS
## Wins First of Baseball Series.— Hard Hitting- and Many Errors. 
### 
That Stanford won by "luck" 041
Saturday is not to he considered
fora moment after reference to the
score. Each side made an equal
number of base hits, hut Stanford
stole twelve bases to U. C.'s four,
and made only five errors to U. C.'s
thirteen. Stanford was at least
one run ahead throughout the
game. California gave away five
runs by miserable fielding in the
eighth inning. Too much credit
can not be given them for
the fierce way in which they at
tempted to retrieve the game in
the ninth inning, batting out live
earned runs. It must be remem
bered, however, that Beckett, Stan
ford's only pitcher, had been hit a
fearful blow on the head by a
pitched ball in the last of the
eighth, and lie was in no condition
to continue the game. Beckett's
misfortune may be s;iid to offset
AlacLaren's severe misplays, leav
ing Stanford victorious through
superior batting, a point where
U. C. was pie-eminent during hist
season and the first part of this.
Tlenessey and Elston of U. C.
knocked the ball over the fence for
home runs: llenessey's hit would,
however, have been caught on an
ordinary fieid. For Stanford Cleni
ans, Wight, Lougheed, and Jeffs
had balls stopped by the fence
which were good for more bases
than actually obtained, possibly
home runs. Clemans, King, Elston,
lloag, and Strohn divided the bat
ting honors. No particularly bril
liant plays were made in fielding
save a few diflicult catches.
The score:
STANFORD.
