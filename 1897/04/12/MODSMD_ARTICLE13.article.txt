One week from next Saturday
we are to contend with Berkeley in
two forms of intercollegiate contest.
It is very important that we should
be very well represented by "root
ers," both at the Field-day and at
the Intercollegiate Debate. It would
be an excellent plan to hold a mass
meeting of the student body a week
from next Friday night to arouse
enthusiasm and to induce all who
can to go to the city the next day.
It might also be well for our liter
ary societies in particular to organ
ize a company of those interested
in debating to give special support
to our representatives on the ros
trum and see that the Stanford
contingent in the audience is con
solidated.
