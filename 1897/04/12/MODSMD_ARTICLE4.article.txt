# AN EXCELLENT CONCERT
## Combined Clubs Make a Great Hit — Northern Trip Debt Wiped Out. 
### 
The largest and most appreci
-1 live audience that has yet gath
ered fora concert on the campus
crowded the chapel Friday even
ing. The announcement that the
combined Mandolin Clubs would
appear, in addition to the special
talent of the clubs, and Miss Jagger
and Dr. Little of Palo Alto, served
to (ill the chapel to overflowing and
to turn many away. The concert
itself was a great success. Perhaps
it may be deemed the most success
ful and most enjoyable concert ever
given by the clubs.
At about 8:30 the combined
Mandolin Clubs tiled on the stage,
presenting a spectacle which per
haps can not be duplicated by any
other university in the country.
Nearly thirty young men and
women were on the stage, and when
they finished the swinging strains
of Kosey's 'Handicap March" the
number received an enthusiastic
encore. The encore was perhaps
better rendered than the first piece,
llie music going with that dash and
swing so necessary to a satisfactory
rendition of Sousa's marches.
The Olee Club sang exceptionally
well. Indeed it has never appeared
to better advantage, 'Dear Old
Stanford" being particularly well
sung. The hits in "Jenk's Com
pound" were thoroughly appreci
ated. The solos and specialty
numbers were all cleverly executed.
Miss Jagger has a voice delight
fully fresh and sweet, and her
number was one of the most enjoy
able on the program. Dr. Little
sang with his accustomed ease and
expression Both were obliged to
respond to hearty encores.
Mr. Riley and Mr. Dillon, though
obliged to repeat numbers previ
ously given on the cam pus, were
unusually well received, both being
recalled twice for each number
given by I hem. Mr. Riley's mono
logue and stories were all cleverly
done. He entertains in an easy,
natural manner, and always car
ries his audience with him. Mr.
Dillon's "Chinese Serenade" was
an unexpected bit of realism, which
was us much appreciated by those
outside —among whom happened to
be several Chinamen —as it was by
those within.
Financially the concert was not
less of a success than it was
musically. The entire debt con
tracted by the clubs on their recent
trip north, amounting to $5(55.00,
lias been cleared off, and the clubs
will end the year with several
hundred dollars to their credit, so
that in all respects the showing
made by the clubs this year is one
of which the University has reason
to be proud.
