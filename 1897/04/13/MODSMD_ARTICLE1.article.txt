# FROM FAR-OFF AUSTRALLA.
## A
						Magnificent Collection of Paintings Received as a Gift For the Museum. 
### 
The Stanford museum lias been
enriched by the presentation of a
magnificent collection of paintings,
the gilt of Mr. Thomas Wei ton
Stanford of Melbourne, Australia.
'J lie pictures are litty in number
and are intended to convey as per
fect an idea as possible of Austra
lian scenery and art. 1 hey were
shipped from Melbourne several
weeks ago and arrived in San Fran
cisco last Friday; when received at
the University they will be distrib
uted in the gallery of the second
floor of the museum. Fora descrip
tion of the collection and of its en
dowment we are indebted to the
Melbourne Herald of February 27.
Mr. Stanford, though a citizen of
far-off Australia, takes his share of
pride in the University founded by
his brother. llis fortune some
day will go to swell the endowment
of the library, which is named after
him, and make it one of the richest
collections of choice and rare books
in the world. For he, too, is child
less â€” the idealized portrait of a
beautiful girl which hangs in his
bedroom at his house in East Mel
bourne tells its own sad tale in
that regard. Ilis dearest object in
life is the betterment of the Uni
versity with which he wishes to
worthily connect his name.
Mr. Stanford is also a devout
lover of the fine arts. Probably
his is the best private collection of
pictures in Australia; and they are
all destined someday to go to Cal
ifornia. About five years ago he
conceived the idea of sending to
Stanford University a collection of
pictures of Australian scenery by
an Australian artist, so that Amer
ican art students might learn some
thing of the scenic beauty of that
part of the world. Conceiving thi
project Mr. Stanford looked about
him for an artist who could carry
out his idea. Ilis choice fell upon
Mr. J. W. Curtis, an Australian
whose work had been much ad
mired for its fidelity to nature and
its technical skill and rich coloring
The commission given to Mr
Curtis was a liberal one. "Paint
me what you please," said Mr.
Stanford, "take your own time,
name your own price, don't hurry,
give me the best you can do, anil
make the pictures really represen
tative of Australian scenery." o.n
such terms as these an artist can
afford to mix his soul with bis
paint, and that is precisely what
Mr. Curtis has done. For the past
four years he has been working in
a studio fitted up in the rear of Mr.
Stanford's house, so that the latter
might take an active interest in
the work as it progressed. Here
he has produced fifty paintings,
perhaps as grand a piece of work
as ever came before from one man's
brush. Some of them are said to
be so beautiful that Mr. Stanford
confesses himself that he does not
like to part with them.
The pictures take their choice of
scenery from all parts of Victoria,
from the Murray to the sea, Alp
pictures, pictures of Macedon in
snow time, Gippsland Lake pictures,
and coast pictures. Mr. Stanford
suggested some of the subjects,

which are so varied in character
and treatment that one experiences
no monotony in witnessing them
all together. The one unifying fea
ture of them all is the ever-present
eucalyptus. Like the motif in some
of Beethoven's symphonies, the gum
repeats itself in all scenes in vast
variety of form and situation. Mr.
Curtis has the art only to be de
rived from a painstaking study of
nature, of individualizing his trees;
every tree he paints has a char
acter of its own; he slums nothing.
When he paints a eucalyptus tree
it is a eucalyptus tree, and not a
generality in green and brown; he
makes his trees live.
One of Mr. Curtis' strong points
is the painting of reflections. His
water is, in all the pictures in
which it is painted, most delicately
and softly done. They are exquis
itely gentle reflections, cool and re
freshing to the eye, done with the
truest perception of the beauty of
nature's images thrown back from
a lake or rippling creek. Such are
the reflections in his "Echuca Park,"
his "Coo-ey, Good Night," and some
of the Gippsland Lake studies.
Warmth of color is the charac
teristic of Mr. Curtis' "Blood-red
Sunset," a picture in which he has
hung the blurred sun in the heav
ens wreathed in clouds that are
bathed in scarlet tones which soften
down in the waters beneath to a
ruddy splendor. "Between Day
light and Dark" is a dawn study,
beautifully soft, but rich with color
in sky and land. In all of these
pictures and in many more there is
that same patient, affectionate,
careful regard for detail which Mr.
Stanford desired should be so im
pressive.
Mr. Stanford says he considers
that he was fortunate in giving the
commission to Mr. Curtis. He is
more than satisfied that the Stan
lord Art Gallery will have a line
collection of Australian landscapes.
Thus his beneficent project has
been carried out beyond his own
expectations and Stanford has been
richly benefited thereby.
