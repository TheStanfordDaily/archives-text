Rarely is anyone found who
willingly pays a class assessment,
and still more rarely is anyone
found who pays a class assessment
unsolicited. Yet in one of the
classes criticism has been made of
the class treasurer by certain
members because they had not
been requested or approached
by the treasurer for their assess
ment. Jf these ingenuous individ
uals are really as anxious to pay
their assessments as their com
plaints would lead one to suppose,
it would be easy to locale the
treasurer of their class, and further
more the Daily Palo Alto will
render any assistance in the power
of its staff to those persons socager
to fulfill their obligations as class
members.
