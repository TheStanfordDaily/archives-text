Considering the fact that the In
tercollegiate Fiekl-day and the In
tercollegiate Debate take place on
the same day, there is no reason
whatsoever why the Stanford stu
dent should not go to the city on a
special train, as has been the cus
tom on Thanksgiving day to the
intercollegiate football game. The
interest that is being taken in both
of these events this year warrants
the assertion that a larger crowd of
Stanford people will attend these
events than ever before.
The same plans for the organiza
tion of our yelling forces should be
adopted as at the football game.
Yell leaders should be appointed
and arrangements should be made
for seating the Stanford students
together. Careful plans well car
ried out will add much to the en
joyment of these events.
