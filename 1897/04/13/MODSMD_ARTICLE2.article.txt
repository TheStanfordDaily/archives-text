# The
						Junior Farce.
## 
### 
The Junior Farce, which will be
produced on the 29ih, is being re
hearsed daily. The piece is a
rather heavy one, requiring much
practise. The play is a longer one
than is usually put on. The class
is very ambitious, however, and
some new talent will undoubtedly
come out in the Junior Class. If
conscientious preparation counts
for anything the Junior Farce this
year should be the best thing of its
kind ever produced here.
