# INTER-SOCIETY DEBATES.
## Much Interest Shown in the Contest Which Takes Place Next Saturday Night. 
### 
The third of the inter-society
contests in debate will take place
m the chapel next Saturday eve
ning at 7:30. At this meeting
Nestoria will debate Saturday
Night Club for first place and En
phronia will contest with Philo
lexia for second place.
The debate between Nestoria and
Saturday Night Club will be upon
the question "Resolved, That a
commercial union between the
United States and the independent
states of the American continent
would be more advantageous to
this country than one with Great
Britain and her dependencies."
Saturday Night Club represented
by Misses Adams and Wade, will
take the affirmative, and Nestoria,
whose representatives are Hunt,
'00, and Ballantyne, '00, will sup
port the negative.
The question to be debated by
Euphronia and Philolexia is "Re
solved, That an income tax is a de
sirable part of a scheme of tax
ation." Miller, '96, and Matheson,
gr., representing Euphronia, will
take the affirmative; Both rock, '98,
and Elias, '99, will defend the neg
ative for Philolexia.
These debates promise to be the
most interesting of the series. By
this time the interest aroused
among the society members is
greater than ever before and the
debaters themselves are profiting
by the criticisms given by mem
bers of the faculty at previous meet
ings and are straining every nerve
to win.
