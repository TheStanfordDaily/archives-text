# Tennis Tournament.
## 
### 
All the first rounds in the singles
of the Tennis Tournament have
been played off with the following re
sults: McGilvray won from Abbott
6-4, 6-4; Francis won from Rolfe
by default; McNeil won from Dag
gett by default; Pratt won from
Page by default; Freeman won
from Hazzard by default; Oskison
won from Kluuber by default;
Schneider won from .Johnson 6-8
6-3; Bartholomew won from Wells
6â€”l, 6-4.
President McNeil has given
noiice that the next rounds be
tween Oskison and McNeil, Francis
and Pratt, McGilvray and Spencer,
and Bartholomew and Freeiu::n
must be played off by Wednesday
night so as to be ready for the
semi-finals on Thursday.
Thus far in the doubles all the
matches that have been decided
have been two defaults, Schneider
and Spencer from McGilvray and
Daggett, and from Klauber and
Francis. Whi.e these are not so
important as the singles, which
ought to have been played long
ago, it seriously inconveniences
those in charge of the tournament
to have the games postponed for so
long.
