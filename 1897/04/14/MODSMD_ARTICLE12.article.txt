Those who attend the basebill
game in San Francisco Saturday
would do well to secure seats in the
same part of the grounds, in order
to combine to encourage our play
ers. Last Saturday the students
from here were so scattered that no
effective cheering could he done,
and as encouragement is necessary
in baseball as well as football
games, our students should not fail
to concentrate for effective work.
