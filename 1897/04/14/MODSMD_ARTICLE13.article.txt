Though the musical clubs are
now out of debt, so far as concerns
their relations to the student body,
they should not forget their obliga
tion to the one who assisted them
at the time the Southern trip was
taken last year. It is hardly cred
itable to the clubs that this debt
should be allowed to remain so
long unpaid. The fact that it is
due a student should not make it
less pressing than if an outside per
son were involved. The clubs have
worked hard this year and have
been obliged to face difficulties that
at times appeared
and they have met them success
fully, too. But this one item of in
debtedness remains, which should
be canceled as soon as it lies within
the power of the clubs to do so.
