A Ninety-nine Class meeting
has been called for Friday to con
sider ways and means for issuing
the volume of the Stanford (}uad
which it devolves upon this class to
publish next year. This is a mat
ter that calls for careful considera
tion at the hands of the members of
the Sophomore Class, and a large
and representative audience should
be present on Friday. If more at
tention were given to details in
planning fora book of this sort
and in organizing the editorial
force, it could in every way be
made a greater success, and the
probabilities of a deficit to be met
from the pockets of complaining
upperclassmen a year or two later
in the course would be considerably
lessened. Now is the time for the
fin-desiecle class to formulate its
plans if it wants its issue of the
Annual handled successfully. If
the success to be desired is not real
ized in its publication, those mem
bers who stay away from Friday's
meeting should forever hold their
peace.
