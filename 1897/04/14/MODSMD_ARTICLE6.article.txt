# Stanford's Chess Team.
## 
### 
The Stanford players in this
year's intercollegiate chess tourna
ment are Serpas, sp., Johnson, '97,
and Kohler, '00.
Serpas, captain of the team, is
from San Salvador, where he learned
the game. He has played with
Griffith, champion of lowa, and
last year played with Epstein, cap
tain of the Berkeley team, by whom
he was defeated. This year Serpas
is much better skilled in openings
and the general technique of the
game than he was then.
Merle Johnson, '97, is the second
member of the team. He plays a
vigorous, dashing game from start
to finish.
Kohler, '00, is an excellent player,
having succeeded in making a draw
with Dr. Lovegrove, champion of
the Pacific Coast. Kohler is care
ful and can generally be depended
on in a match game.
