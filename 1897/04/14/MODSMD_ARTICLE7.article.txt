# Princeton's Student Hospital.

### 
A recent report of the Princeton
infirmary shows a record of seventy
six students who have received
medical attendance during the past
year. These students have been
treated free of charge, the best of
nursing and medical service always
having been given.
The success of Princeton's in
firmary brings to mind the ques
tion of establishing a students' hos
pital at Stanford, which has long
been talked of. It was with this
end in view that the Students'
Guild was planned and organized.
Those who were instrumental in its
formation believed that with the
growth of the Guild and the yearly
increase of its funds through the fee
collected at the registration of stu
dents, the organization might in
time be able to undertn ke the found
ing of an institution of its own.
Three years have passed since
the Guild was first started, and
nothing has yet been accomplished.
What few students who have been
assisted in time of sickness or acci
dent have merely had money
loaned to them, the Guild thus act
ing as a trust fund, ever increasing,
yet making no disbursements that
mean anythingtoits patrons. With
something over five hundred dollars
in its treasury the Guild might well
undertake the establishment of
some means of medical attendance

and treatment which would greatly
benefit the students who contribute
to its support.
