the Pali, four and a half miles,
where a splendid view of a large
portion of Oahu Island is had over
a perpendicular precipice 1200 feet
high; or drive up Punchbowl hill,
iin extinct volcano, three miles di
rectly back of the town, a very
beautiful :md extensive view of the
city and harbor is obtained. The
palace and government buildings,
in the grounds of the latter stands
a bronze statue of Kamehameha
the Great, founder of the Hawaiian
monarchy. Kavvhaiahoa Church.
The Queen's Hospital, built in 1860,
in honor of Queen Emma; and the
avenue of palms. East of thecity,
close to the foothills, are Lunalilo
Home foraged and destitute Ha
vvaiians, founded by' King Lunalilo,
and Oahu College; on the west side
are the Kamehameha schools, the
insane asylum, and Oahu prison.
The fish ponds in the vicinity of
the docks are also worth a visit.

the trip is the sea voyage, taking
seven days each way. Rates and
