The indebtedness of the seniors
must be discharged before the end
of the semester. As all schemes to
secure funds by means of entertain
ments have failed, the money must
be raised by a class assessment. If
an assessment is to be levied, pay
ment should be enforced upon all
members of the class. It would be
unjust fora few persons to have to
pay the whole amount of the debt
when the entire class is responsible
for the same.
