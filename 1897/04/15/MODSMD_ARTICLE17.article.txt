The financial statement pub
lished in last evening's issue, show
ing the amount of old debts that
have been paid by the present man
agement, is very much to the credit
of the Associated Students. Many
of these obligations were contracted
two and three years ago, and the
faet that they have been outstand
ing for so long has at times mili
tated very seriously against student
body officers in making new con
tracts. While there are some new
bills of the current year yet to be
paid, there is good prospect of clos
ing the year entirely free from debt.
