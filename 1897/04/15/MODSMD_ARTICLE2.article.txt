May 21 to 80. The initial meeting
was held last summer at Cazadero,
Cal., and was intended to be for
the college men of the Pacific Coast
what Northfield is for the East, and
Lake Geneva and Knoxville are
for the Middle West and South. As
outlined in the announcements "the
well understood purpose of this
gathering is to deepen the spiritual
life of college men, to train them
for leadership in organized Chris
tian work among their fellow stu

bilities 5, of Christian service which
awaits them after graduation."
The work will consist principally
of Bible study, the Missionary In

The afternoons will be given up
entirely to athletics and recreation.
C. S. Dole, '98, will be Stanford's
representative on the athletic com

received justify the belief that this

most significant gatherings in the
history of colleges on the Pacific

The expense has been made re
markably low, the location is a
most attractive one, the dates have
been carefully arranged, and it is
expected that Stanford will be well
