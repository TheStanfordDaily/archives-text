# MEETING OF SENIORS.
## Matters Concerning Payment of Class Debts Considered This Afternoon. 
### 
A meeting of the Senior Class
was held today at 2 p.m. in room
50. After the reading of the min
utes the report of the Vaudeville
committee was read and adopted.
The committee recommended that
no show be given, as all the favor
able dates between now and Com
mencement were taken, and it
would result in financial loss.
The indebtedness of the class to
H. S. Crocker and Company for the
'97 Annual was then taken under
consideration. The amount of the
debt is $330. A letter from the
publishing house to President Jor
dan was read. It was stated that
he had replied that the matter was
beyond his jurisdiction, and that it
should be handled by the company
as they thought best. Letters to
President Pope of the Class urging
that immediate action be taken
and threatening to put the matter
into the hands of an attorney were
then read, and finally one showing
that this had subsequently been
done. This communication stated
that unless some definite action
were taken toward the payment of
the debt by the- loth proceedings
would be instituted against the
members of the class.
A long and what proved to be a
profitless discussion then followed.
President Pope stated that, while
the manager of the annual, Mr.
Spencer, was technically responsi
ble for the debt until his report had
been formally adopted by the class,
and that while he had given his
note to the company for the entire
amount, the class was under moral
obligations to assume it. Ibis po
sition was tacitly accepted by all
who spoke later, and the discussion
was confined to plans for the liqui
dation of the debt. It was brought
out that there is still about $130
owing to the Annual, and that there
were one hundred and forty copies
of the Annual not yet disposed of.
Finally a motion was introduced
that an assessment of two dollars
be levied for the payment of the
debt, and that the consent of those
who had already paid the live dol
lar assessment to apply two dollars
of it on the lust one be obtained,
and that the treasurer insist on the
payment of this from every member
of the class. While the motion
was pending, another to adjourn to
1:30 p.m. on Monday was carried.
