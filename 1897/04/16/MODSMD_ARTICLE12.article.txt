Ninety-nine took a somewhat
radical step this afternoon in giv
to the editor-in-chief of next year's
Annual the power of appointment
and removal over the associate ed
itors of his staff. It is, however, a
step which we believe will be justi
fied when its practical working re
sults are shown. It should lead to
the selection of the most efficient
and harmonious board the class af
fords, and certainly that is the
great desideratum for any class to
take into consideration.
