Editor Daily Palo Alto: I feel
that us a member of the Class
of "J7 I must express my
feeling on the subject of the class
debt, especially as no action was
taken this afternoon.
We can not as a class afford to
dilly-dally about the matter. We
are responsible for the acts of our
agent, and, though we might on a
technicality avoid payment, it is a
poor way to leave our alma mater
with a debt behind us. Another
meeting has been called for Mon
day. Let us vote an assessment
sufficient to cover all demands, go
into our pockets and pay both that
and the class dues, and then we
can participate in the exercises of
Commencement Week and receive
our diplomas with clear consciences,
proud in knowing that we leave the
University with no debts behind to
be a reproach upon us. U J7.
