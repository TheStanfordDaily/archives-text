# NO AGREEMENT REACHED.
## The 						Bicycle Race and Matter of Points Remain Undecided. 
### 
Manager Brown of Stanford met
Manager Barnes and the faculty
athletic committee of Berkeley,con
sisting of Professors Bacon, Clapp,
and Edwards, at the University
Club in San Francisco last Satur
day to agree upon the matter of
points and the place of holding the
bicycle races of the coming inter
collegiate meet The Stanford Fac
ulty Athletic Committee had de
clined to participate in the discus
sion, although Dr. Angell of that
body was present. No agreement
was reached.
The U. C. Faculty Athletic Com
mittee's proposition to arbitrate the
matter of points was accepted by
Manager Brown, as there was no
provision, in writing, about this
matter in the intercollegiate agree
ment. They also asked for arbitra
tion to determine where the bicycle
races should be held, but as this is
definitely provided for in the agree
ment, Manager Brown refused their
request. Upon this Prof. Bacon of
California declared the Field-day
off, and the meeting adjourned.
Nothing further has been done
about the matter, but some ar
rangement may be made, so that
the meet can be held.
The question of points was first
mentioned at the intercollegiate
committee meeting February 20,
1897. U. C. expressed a desire to
have points count 5:3:1. Rein
hardt, U. C., claims that A. A. U.
rules state that first, second, and
third shall so count, and since the
Field-day is governed by these
rules that jio question as to how
places are going to count can arise.
Stanford representatives question
this, but not being able to offer
anything definite to the contrary,
drop the argument.
Upon investigation it was found
that the A. A. U. rules for the past
three or four years say nothing re
garding this matter, although at
one time 5:3:1 was the scoring for
the individual championship of the
United States. Final action neces
sarily came into the managers'
hands.
Manager Barnes requested a
change, but on being asked for rea
sons, stated that U. C. thought it
fairer to have 3 for second instead
of 2. As the most important inter
collegiate association in America
counts 2 instead of 3, his statement
was questioned, although the West
ern Intercollegiate Association score
is 5:3:1. As much, if not more, can
be said in favor of 5:2:1, if what
other associations do is considered.
Manager Brown claimed that two
years ago U. C. desired to change
from 5:3:1 to 5:2:1 and Stanford
consented, as it made no material
difference to either side; and they
now demand a change to the former
count without giving and good rea
son, simply because from indica
tions it may be more beneficial to
them for the coming field games.
Each manager insisted upon bis
stand. In the mean time the U. C.
Executive Committee passed a reso
lution that on a basis of fairness
points should count in the coming
field games 5:3:1, and Stanford was
so notified; but this plan was not
successful, and it caused more

trouble than if they had left ihe
matter entirely alone.
This is how the matter stands at
present, Manager Brown's offer last
Saturday to arbitrate the question
of points not being accepted.
Manager Barnes telegraphed to
New York in regard to points anil
received the following answer: "The
rules of A. A. U. say nothing as to
scoring points, but 5:3:1 is custom
ary"; but as this association has no
connection with colleges, its
customs have no bearing upon the
subject whatever, as they have
never been considered.
Both managers agree that the
Velodrome track is the safest for
the bicycle race. U. C. wants the
race Friday afternoon. Stanford
wants it Saturday at 1 p.m., the
grounds being located for specta
tors to see both the bicycle race
and other games without incon
venience. Manager Barnes claims
that it will tire him for the
races in the field games to hold the
bicycle race on Saturday, and also
says that it would advertise the
games better to hold the wheel race
the day before.
Manager Brown says he does
not see the necessity for Mr. Barnes
going to the bicycle meet if it tired
him, and claimed that the ad
vertising would be of little value.
After trying for three weeks to get
Barnes to accept his offer and only
being told that it was unreasonable,
Brown withdrew the proposition
and notified Barnes that the race
should be run as prescribed by
intercollegiate agreement, which
states positively that it shall be
held as in the past four years
directly in connection with other
events.
