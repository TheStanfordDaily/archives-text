Stanford lost her first athletic
contest for the college yeur last
Saturday when she went down
before the U. C. baseball team
for the second time in the
history of the University. The de
feat is almost inexcusable. There
is no doubt that some of the men
lapsed into indifference through
over-confidence, while Berkeley
pulled together for the effort of her
life. The score shows the result.
The loss of a game, however, does
not mean defeat. Honors are even
and there yet remains one more
chance for the championship. J)o
we want it?
