The sensational article in this
morning's Call, in which the state
ment is made that Stanford charges
Berkeley with cowardice and we
are bitter because we feel ourselves
to have been robbed of a certain
victory, wholly misinterprets the
Stanford sentiment.
While it is true that we were
very much disappointed when the
report reached us that no agree
ment had been reached, it is un
just to impute to us statements
that were never made. The most
we ever did was to hope for victory;
and as for charging our rivals with
covvirdice, the report is too flimsy
to need refutation. It is such
work as this that goes so far to make
a small disagreement a source of
bitter enmity. The most serious
charge we can bring against our
U. C. friends is that they are mis
taken, and our respect for their
sense of fairness leads us to hope
that matters will be satisfactorily
adjusted. Our own conscientious
preparation testifies to our respect
of their prowess.
