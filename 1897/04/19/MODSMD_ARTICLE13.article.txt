ton at one time or another, includ
ing Washington, Adams, Madison,

The University of Illinois will
probably be compelled to close its
doors on account of the defalcation
of Treasurer O. W. Spalding, ex
president of the Globe Savings
Bank of Chicago. The bank for
the university held $1-10,000 in
cash and $400,000 in endowment
bonds and many of the bonds have
been improperly disposed of.
Commenting on Yale's defeat of
Harvard in the recent debate on
the bimetallic question, the Denver
Evening Pout asserts that it was a
"clear intellectual light between
gold monometallism and bimetal
lism, and the defeat of goldism in
its stronghold, the colleges, is very
pleasant to record as a sign of the
times. Yale has more than atoned
for an unpleasantness in the late
campaign."
