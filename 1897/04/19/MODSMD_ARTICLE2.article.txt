# Stanford Loses at Chess.
## 
### 
Tho Chess Tournament between
Stanford and Berkeley players on
Saturday was won by the latter.
Our representatives were Carlos
Serpas, Merle Johnson, and F. W.
Kohler.
Play was commenced in the li
brary of the Hopkins Institute of
Art at 10 o'clock. At the first ta
ble were Saul Epstein and Serpas;
at the second were Theodore DeLa
guna and Johnson; and at the third
11. 11. Parkhurst and Kohler. The
game between Epstein and Serpas
was vei'y close, neither of the play
ers gaining any advantage until to
ward the end of the game, when
Epstein gained a pawn by trading
queens. This advantage won him
the game.
Johnson had his game won from
the start, his superiority over his
opponent being very apparent. The
game lasted three hours and thirty
minutes.
Kohler lost his game simply
through a tnisplay when he had
his man almost beaten. The loss
of these two games gave Berkeley
the tournament.
