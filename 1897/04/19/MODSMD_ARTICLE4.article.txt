# DEFEATED ON THE DIAMOND.
## Berkeley's Strong Game and Stanford's Errors Tell the Tale. 
### 
Stanford was out-batted and out
fielded in the second <ff the inter
collegiate series. Kaarsburg's
bases on balls were responsible for
all but one run made by the Caidi
nal. Errors by Stanford helped
greatly to swell the runs of their
opponents, but Berkeley's heavier
batting was the main factor in
their well-earned victory.
U. C. started off with three runs
on Lougheed's errors and a hit by
Krug. In the second Stanford
moved one ahead on bases on balls
and hits by Strohn and Cleinans.
Berkeley made four runs in the
fifth and sixth and Stanford tied in
the sixth. Beckett was batted all
over the lot in the seventh, and
Thompson took his place. Loug
heed knocked the ball over the
fence in the ninth, after three men
had drawn bases on balls, but it
was too late.
Freeman played the best ball for
Stanford. Strohn followed him
closely but muffed a throw from
Clemans. The rest of the team
were weak either in fielding or bat
ting. Jeff's throwing was poor.
Lougheed, Wight, and Clemans had
seven errors between them. Sharp,
Beckett, Thompson, and Wight
were weak in hitting.
Every one of California's team
made an excellent showing with
the exceptions of Kuster and Kaars
burg. MacLarens out-field play
saved several runs. Hennessey,
Elston, Krug, and lloag are also
to be commended.
