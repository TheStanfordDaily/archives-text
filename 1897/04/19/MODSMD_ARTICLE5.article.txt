# Tomorrow Evening's Lecture.
## 
### 
The lecture tomorrow evening
will be given by Rev. James Mc-
Donald of St. Peter's Church, San
Francisco. The subject is "Joan of
Arc." This lecture is given at the
suggestion of the professors of the
German department whose classes
have been studying Schiller's Jung
frau von Orleans this semester.
The fact that all the text books on
the subject, and nearly all the
biographies of prominence, have
been written from the standpoint
of Protestantism led those inter
ested in the subject to invite Arch
bishop Riordan of San Francisco
to deliver a lecture on Joan of Arc
as viewed by Catholic authorities
Being unable to accept this in
vitation the Archbishop recom
mended Rev. McDonald who will
speak tomorrow evening. Students
in German and History should be
especially interested in the lecture.
