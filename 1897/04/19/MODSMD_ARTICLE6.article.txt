### 
At a meeting of the Senior Class
this afternoon the report of the
committee appointed at the last
meeting was adopted and thus a
long and fruitless discussion was
brought to an end.
The report provides that the
president shall appoint a commit

urer shall be treasurer. This com
mittee is to apply the $150 already
collected exclusively toward Com

from the assessments collected here
after the Annual debt is to receive
first attention, and when this is ef
faced, the remainder is to go toward
Commencement Week expenses. If
there should still he a surplus, the
paying members of the clasn are to
be reimbursed pro rata. The com
mittee has full power to take any
action it sees fit and will meet
twice a week as long as it seems
necessary.
