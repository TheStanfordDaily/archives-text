# BERKELEY'S ULTIMATUM.
## California Says Stanford Must Arbitrate Before Tomorrow Night. 
### 
The Berkeley track management
has issued its ultimatum. Colonel
George C. Edwards, Manager
Barnes, Captain Brown, and Mel
ville Dozier were appointed to draw i
a statement embodying the position
of the U. C. management and the
reasons for the same.
The statement goes on to rehearse
the difficulties in the way of com
ing to an agreement with Stanford.
They aver that negotiations came I
to naught because Manager Brown |
of Stanford flatly refused to arbi-j
trate the question relating to the
scoring of points and to the time
and place of holding the bicycle j
race. Thereupon the U. C. mana
ger and the chairman of the faculty
committee on athletics of the IJ. C.'
declared that without arbitration j
there could be no contest
The ultimatum of the U. C. au- !
thorities is as follows:
"The California team will remain j
in training until Wednesday even-j
ing, April 21, which Has been dei
cided upon as being the latest date
when any reconsideration may be t
had. But in no event will the eon-1
test take place unless the matter in
issue be arbitrated."
The California manager gives his
reasons for assuming his position j
as follows:
First. —In the matter of the bi
cycle race both managers agreed to
have this race on the Velodrome
track, but Stanford's manager
wanted it on the same afternoon as
the field-day. The California man
ager preferred to have it on the
afternoon before the field-day as an |
advertisement and as a matter of
convenience, and offered to pay the
extra expenses incurred by the
Stanford management. Failing to
agree, the Stanford manager with- j
drew his consent to have the bicycle |
race held at the Velodrome, a reg-!
ular bicycle track, and insisted
that it be held on the Olympic cin
der track. From previous exper
ience in the matter of accidents ex
tending over several years the
Olympic track has been found to
be an extremely dangerous one for
fast riding.
Secondly. —As to the matter of
scoring, the intercollegiate agree
ment provides that "the rules of the
Amateur Athletic Union shall gov
ern all contests." These rules at
the time of adoption of the agree
ment prescribed that scoring should j
be 5 for first, 3 for second, and 1 |
for third place. At present the;
Athletic Union gives champion-:
ships and does not recognize inter
club contests. At the meeting of
the two intercollegiate committees
in February last, which consisted
of three representatives from each
university, the matter of scoring
was briefly considered, and five of
the members expressed themselves
as being in favor of scoring. 5:3:1.
The matter, however, was not put
to a vote, because it was thought
that the rules of the Amateur Ath
letic Union covered the point. At
the last two field days the captains
agreed to score 5:2:1, and did so
without any authority, whereas at
the previous field-days the scoring
had been 5:3:1.
A telegram which Manager

Barnes has from President McMil
lan of the A. A. U. states that the
A. A. U. does not prescribe any
method of scoring but that the cus
tom is 5:3:1.
Manager Brown has defined his
position so often and so clearly that
it does not need to be repeated. He
announced this afternoon that his
position is the same, despite Berke
ley's ultimatum.
