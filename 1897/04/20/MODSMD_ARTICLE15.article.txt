The loss which the University of
California suffered in the destruc
tion of the Agricultural building,
a loss to the whole State of Califor
nia, is a witness of the necessity of
maintaining in connection with
every university a well-disciplined
fire department. This is especially
necessary in a college isolated as
Stanford is, where aid in fighting
tire could be obtained only from the
students and the neighboring com
munity. Our tire department
should be ready if its services
should ever he required.
