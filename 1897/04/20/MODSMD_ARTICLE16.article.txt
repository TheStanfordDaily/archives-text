Perhaps the most unfortunate
fact in the present intercollegiate
dispute is that all the disputes
could not have been decided and
definitely settled before such a late
date. 'Hie whole dispute was able
to arise because the intercollegiate
athletic agreement did not specify
the exact number of points which
places in the field-day should
count. Whatever may be the out
come of the present difficulty it
should result in a closer scrutiny
of our intercollegiate agreement
and an absolute specification of all
details relating to intercollegiate
athletic contests. Had such been
done this dispute would not have
arisen with the consequent danger
of preventing the intercollegiate
field-day from taking place.
