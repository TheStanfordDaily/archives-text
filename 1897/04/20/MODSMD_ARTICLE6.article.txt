# INTER-SOCIETY DEBATES.
## Nestoria Comes out Champion, With Euphronia Holding Second Place. 
### 
The third inter-society contest in
debate was held in the chapel last
Saturday night. This meeting was
the best of the series and a large
audience was out to hear the de
bates and criticisms.
The first debate was between
Nestoria and Saturday Night Club
upon the question of a Pan-Amer
ican commmerial union Nestoria
was represented by Hunt, '00, and
Ballantyne, '00. Saturday Night
Club's representatives were Misses
Wade and Adams. Dr. Ross, as
judge, gave the decision in favor of
Nestoria.
The second debate was upon the
question of an income tax for the
United States. Miller, '96, and
Matheson, gr., appeared for Eu
phronia. Philolexia was repre
sented by Elias, '99, and Rothrock,
'98. Dr. Powers acted as judge in
this debate and decided in favor of
Euphronia.
The criticisms given by Profs.
Powers and Ross at the close of the
debates were the feature of the
evening and they were followed
with close attention.
At the close of tne meeting
Chairman Schwartz stated that the
decisions of the evening obviated
the necessity of having another
contest to complete the series. He
announced Nestoria as the society
entitled to the championship, with
Euphronia holding second place.
It is probable that arrangements
will be made fora similar series of
contests the first semester of next
year. This is the first plan for
inter-society meetings that has
proven to be a success, and it will
doubtless bo followed up by some
thing along the same line with
more time given the speakers for
preparation.
