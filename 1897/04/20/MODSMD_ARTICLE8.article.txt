# New Stories Promised.
## 
### 
There are to be three continued
stories of University life published
in the Sequoia beiore the close of
the present semester. Two of them
are by Dane CoTTlidge and the other
is by W. IL Irwin. The first story,
"Hebe, the Coffee Boy," by Mr.
Coolidge, was commenced in last
week's issue. Mr. Coolidge is best
known to the readers of the Sequoia
as the author of "The Conscious
Freak of Ralph Jerome." He is a

writer of no inconsiderable power
and promise; one who watches al
ways, sees much, and forgets little.
The force and realism of his stories
of certain phases of Stanford life
make them by far the best of any
such work that has hitherto been
attempted here. With all its strik
ing realism his work is not without
the note of imagination.
Professor A.(i. Newcomer is to
have an article on Mrs. Alice Mey
11el 1, an English writer of remarka
ble and unique power.
