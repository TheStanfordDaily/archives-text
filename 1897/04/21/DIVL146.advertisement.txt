The demand for the $50
Hartford bicycle is increas
ing beyond the facilities for
its manufacture. Conse
quently, rather than make
factory alterations at this
time of the season, heroic
measures have been adopted.
The price of the $75 and
$65 Hartfords is reduced to
$60 and $55. We believe
they are equal to any bicycles
made, except the Columbia,
and will not hesitate to have
them examined piece by piece
with any other machine.
