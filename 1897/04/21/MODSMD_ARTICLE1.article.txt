# GENEROUSLY GIVES WAY.
## To Make the Field-Day Possible Stanford Will Allow Berkeley to Decide. 
### 
Although called upon short no
tice, the student body mass meet
ing held in the chapel this after
noon was as large and enthusiastic
a crowd as was ever called together
to discuss a matter of student inter
est. The meeting was held to get
the sentiment of the students con
cerning the action of Manager
Brown in the Field-day dispute.
Though governed largely by enthu
siasm its action was deliberate,
looking to the idea that it was bet
ter to concede everything and take
our chances than to give up the
Field-day entirely. By a vote al
most unanimous the stand of Man
ager Brown was approved, and he
was directed to turn the whole mat
ter over to the faculty athletic com
mittee of Berkeley for settlement.
At ten minutes of two President
Pomeroy called the meeting to or
der. After stating the purpose of
the meeting he called upon Mana
ger Brown to inform the students
how matters stood. Brown said
that as matters now were neither
manager is willing to turn over his
hand to have the Field-day take
place. At the meeting between the
representatives of the two univer
sities last Saturday, he had agreed
to arbitrate the dispute in regard
to the points, but contended that as
the bicycle race had been entirely
settled by the agreement between
the two universities made last Feb
ruary, there was consequently
nothing about this to be arbitrated.
On this the president of the Berke
ley faculty athletic committee de
clared the Field-day off. Manager
Brown did not at all wish to recede
from his position, but would waive
all personal feeling in deference to
the wishes of the student body,
ilis present plan was to leave the
matter entirely in the hands of
Berkeley's athletic committee for
settlement.
The chairman then called upon
J)r. Angell, chairman of our faculty
athletic committee. He was sev
eral times interrupted with ap
plause, especially when referring to
the faithfulness of Manager Brown
and the trust the faculty commit
tee imposed in him. He said the
policy of the Stanford faculty ath
letic committee had been always to
leave student affairs entirely in the
hands of the student managers,
lie desired to see Mr. Brown's pol
icy go through—to let the Berkeley
faculty athletic committee decide
all the disputes. He made a state
ment to this effect to the Berkeley
committee, saying to them: "But
when the Field-day comes off, gen
tlemen, we will try to see that we
get a majority of the points." Great
applause followed Dr. Angell's
■speech, and the rousing Stanford
yell showed that Dr. Angell had
struck the true chord of our under
graduate sentiment.
It was moved that it be the sense
of the meeting that Manager
Brown's conduct be approved and
that he be upheld in his proposed
course of leaving the matter to the
athletic committee of the Berkeley
faculty. Zion, '94, moved to amend
by striking out the last part of the
motion. After some discussion the

question was called for and a vote
taken which resulted in the defeat
of the amendment, only four votes
being cast in its favor. The origi
nal motion was then carried unan
imously.
The following telegram was im
mediately sent to Berkeley:
"Prof. Thomas Bacon: The Stan
ford student body voted today to
submit the question of points and
bicycle race for final action to the
U. C. faculty athletic committee.
Prof. Clapp please act as our repre
sentative. Frank Angell."
At 8:28 p.m. the following answer
was received:
"Berkeley, Cal.
"Prof. Frank Angell: Dispatch
just received. Prof. Bacon out of
town. Will report tomorrow.
E. B. Clapp."
Manager Brown went to the city
on the 5 p.m. train to report to the
IJ. C. committee and hasten the
settlement of the dispute.
