If the proposition of Stanford is
n c.'pli d and it is decided to hold
the field-day Saturday, the plan of
having a rally Friday night should
be carried out. This rally might
be one for the double purpose of
arousing enthusiasm for the lield
day contests and interest for the
debate. Let the president of the
student body call such a meeting
as soon as this matter is settled,
and then let every one come out to
swell the attendance and "whoop'er
up for Stanford."
