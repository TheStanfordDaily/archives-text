Every possible concession has
now been made in our endeavor to
have the field-day held. We have
3'ielded to Berkeley every point in
the controversy, even those of
which we had the better side of the
the argument. Now let this gener
osity be reciprocated. Let the
rides be drawn as tbe faculty ath
letic committee of the University
of California may direct, so that
when Saturday comes, the test may
be one of strength and speed rather
than a quibble over points of de
tail. Surely Berkeley herself could
desire no more than this.
