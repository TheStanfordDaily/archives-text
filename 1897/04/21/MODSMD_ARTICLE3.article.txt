# The
						Debt of the Seniors.

### 
Professor It. L. Green, chairman
of the faculty committee on stu
dent publications, has written as
follows to President Pope of the Se
nior Class concerning the payment
of the class debt:
"Complying with your request I
send you this statement of the sug
gestions of the committee which
has considered the difficulty
arising from the unpaid debt of the
Annual.
"It is the opinion of the commit
tee that the class is responsible for
the debt. The difficulty has arisen
at this late date largely because of
the carelessness of the class in its
oversight of the business of the An
nual.
"As to practical methods of meet
ing the debt, the committee sug
gests that if the assessment of $5.00
already voted by the class for Com
mencement Week expenses is gen
erally paid by the members, there
will be money enough for reasona
ble expenditures of Commencement
and also enough to pay the debt of
the Annual. The members of the
class should have too much class
patriotism to allow the spectacle to
be presented of a class about to
graduate providing hundreds of
dollars for Commencement Week
entertainments, and at the same
time refusing to pay a just debt con
tracted during the previous year.
"It is the desire of the committee
not to interfere in the matter. The
class should extricate itself from
the unpleasant situation in which
it has placed itself, without requir
ing any pressure from outside
souices. The committee will inter
fere, if at all, only after every effort
has been made by the class organi
zation to pay the debt.
