## The 						Co-Op. Will Be Replaced by the New Organization of the Professors. 
### 
The meeting of the stockholders
| of the Co-op., advertised for yester
day afternoon, could not be held
for lack of a quorum. This meet
i ing was necessary in order to take
' some action on the offer of the or
j ganizers of the Stanford Book Store
I for the purchase of the old stock
I now held by the Co-operative Asso
ciation. The offer of $1700 for
this stock was made on the basis
of an inventory taken February 25,
and was to have been withdrawn
unless acted upon before today.
Realizing the necessity of taking
some action and recognizing the
futility of attempting to secure a
majority of the stock represented
at a meeting, the board of directors
decided to take the matter into its
own hands. The offer of the Stan
ford Book Store was accordingly
accepted. Steps towards disineor
j poration will be taken at once.
: The money received for the stock
jon hand is probably in excess of
its real present value, as sales have
been made since the inventory was
taken, it will be used to pay the
debts of the old Association and to
reimburse the stockholders for
their outlay.
The new organization is now in
a position to begin operations for
next year. About lifteen applica
tions have been received for the po
sition of manager. The directors
will probably abide their intention
of choosing an outside person as
manager. A considerable sum of
money will have to be borrowed to
start the store, but already several
offers have been received on very
favorable terms, so that the organ
izers anticipate no difficulty in this
particular.
