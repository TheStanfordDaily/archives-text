# The
						Seal Herd Question.
## 
### 
Charles Hamlin, formerly As
sistant Secretary of the Treasury
and now advisory agent of the
State Department, is on his way
here from Washington to confer
with Dr. Jordan in regard to the
Bering Sea seal herd question.
He is expected to arrive here Sun
day. It has been reported that
Dr. Jordan will go to the Seal
Islands again this summer for the
purpose of investigating, but this is
not true. President McKinley has
not as yet appointed the commis
sion to visit Alaska this summer.
Dr. Jordan will not be able to
make another trip and conse
quently his appointment will prob
ably not be made.
