Stanford has never yet gone
into an intercollegiate contest of
any kind without feeling that vic
tory if won would be well-earned
and deserved. There has never
been a time when we could believe
that Berkeley would not gi\e as
much as she would take, nor that
her contestants would not tight as
bard for victory as ours. In the
two events in which our represen
tatives will contest on Saturday
there is every reason to believe that
the Cardinal and the Blue and (jold
will be almost evenly matched, and
that neither can win without a
struggle.
It is apparent then that the side
which is most encouraged, which
receives the largest and most en
thusiastic. support and the greatest
share of applause will be immen
sely aided in its effort. Not mere
sentiment and enthusiasm alone,
but numbers we need. Let every
one go to the Field-day and Debate
who possibly can. A large attend
ance is what we need and what we
must have.
