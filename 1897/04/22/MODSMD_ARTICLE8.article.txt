# COLLEGE VERSE.
## Second Series of "Cap and Gown" Issued—Stanford Represented. 
### 
L C. Page and Company of Bos
ton have just issued the second se
ries of Cap and Gown, a collection
of intercollegiate verse. It is a
neat little volume of some three
hundred pages, containing over
three hundred selections gathered
from the colleges and universities of
the country. No other edition has
been made since 1892. The present
volume was edited by Mr. Frederick
Laurence Knowles, Harvard '91.
In his prefatory note the editor
explains the nature and purpose of
the hook. "The gay verses which
celebrate undergraduate life," he
says, "must not be taken too seri
ously. They seldom pretend to the
dignity of poetry. College verse, if
1 understand it, is verse suited to
the period and point of view of un
dergraduate days. Light, graceful,
humorous, sparkling—it is true —
fo'r young men and women about to
take upon themselves the responsi
bilities of mature life are at heart
by no means frivolous—but touch
ing the note of grief, if at all, al
most as though by accident. Yet
like all sound art, college verse
must above all else be honest.
"In looking over very many un
dergraduate papers I have been
struck with several facts. First,
there seems to be a general fond
ness for the sonnet, and a very gen
eral lack of success in writing it.
Second, the French forms of light
verse are exceedingly popular, par
ticularly the rondeau, ballade, and
triolet. These, more easily lending
themselves to gay moods than does
the sonnet, are written with much
greater success. Triolets are per
haps least often, rondeaux most
often, successful. Third, purely
sentimental verse is little written
in women's colleges, its place being
taken by poetry of nature or of re
flection. College girls show possi
bly more maturity of reflective
power than do their brothers, but
they are notably weaker in the
sense of humor. Fourth, among so
much merely graceful verse, there
are not wanting touches here and
there of genuine poetry."
The merest glance at the con
tents of the volume fully
justifies this last statement. The
divisions of the book are: 1. Love
and Sentiment; 11. Comedy; 111.
College and Campus; IV. Nature;
V. In Serious Mood. The book is
a perfect gem, one which every col
lege man and woman will delight to
have and enjoy.
Stanford is largely represented in
the volume. About two months
ago Mr. Knowles wrote to the ed
itor of the Daily Palo Alto for
Stanford selections, and a number
were forwarded to him at Tilton,
New Hampshire. Selections were
made from the Sequoia, the Stan
ford Quad, and a copy of "Four-
Leaved Clover" was sent to Mr.
Knowles. Twelve poems by Stan
ford authors were chosen from the
large number sent, and they are
published in Cap and Gown.
Miss Henrietta L. Stadtmuller is
represented by the poem entitled
"A Change of Heart," and Edward
M. Hulme by the lyric beginning
"Beneath the lilac tree." Mr.
Charles K. Field, '95, has ten po

ems in the collection, which its a
larger representation than that
given any other single writer, with
the exception of Mr. Guy Wetinore
Carryl of Columbia, who has
eleven. Those by "Carolus Ager"
are: "Evening on the Campus,"
"Four Valentines," "God's Acre,"
"Strategy," "The Prof.'s Little
Girl," '•Relapse," "The Ladye of
the Lab.," "A Hero," "In His Own
Country," and"The Ideal Co-Ed."
