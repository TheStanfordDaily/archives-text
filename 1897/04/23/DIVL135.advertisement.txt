7he demand for the $50
Hartford bicycle is increas
ing beyond the facilities for
its manufacture. Conse
quently, rather than make
factory alterations at this
time of the season, heroic
measures have been adopted.

$65 Hart fords is reduced to
$60 and $55. IVe believe
they are equal to any bicycles
made, except the Columbia,
and will not hesitate to have
them examined piece by piece
with any other machine.
