# Trip to the Yellowstone.
## 
### 
Preparations are being made for
a trip through the Yellowstone im
mediately after the close of the
semester. The party will be com
posed of a number of students and
professors and will be headed by
Dr. Branner. Two years ago a
similar party under the leadership
of Dr. Jordan made a pleasant six
days' journey in the Park, and
indications are that the party this
year will have an equally pleasant
and profitable time.
