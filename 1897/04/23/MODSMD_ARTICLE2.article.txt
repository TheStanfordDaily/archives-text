The play deals largely with the
football problem, particularly the
phase of parental objection. Harry
Hunter, left tackle and captain on
the Varsity eleven, is forbidden by
his parents to play footbiill and in
a fit of independence he cuts loose
from his family and begins to work
bis own way through college. His
Unele Jason, an Arizona cattle king,
is dispatched by the Hunter family
to find the missing scion, and traces
him to a summer hotel where a lot
of jolly students have engaged
themselves to the management as
waiters and are dividing their time
between waiting on table and [los
ing as attractions in order to win
feminine custom. Not having seen
his nephew since he was a child,
the old man is easily turned off the
trail by Ralph Simpson, an enter
prising university "joslier," and the
play follows his adventures in find
ing his real nephew and in becom
ing a howling football fiend. Mat
ters are further complicated by the
crossed love affairs of uncle and
nephew, but the play ends by the
latter scoring on the goal of his
| affections. The first two acts
are laid at Manzanita Mineral
! Springs, a summer resort in the
mountains. The last act takes
place in the quadrangle six weeks
j later.
