The demand for the $50
Hartford bicycle is increas
| ing beyond the facilities for
its manufacture. Conse
quently, rather than make
factory alterations at this
time of the season, heroic
measures have been adopted.
The price of the $75 and
$65 Hartfords is reduced to
$60 and $55. We believe
they are equal to any bicycles
made, except the Columbia,
and will not hesitate to have
them examined piece by piece
with any other machine.
