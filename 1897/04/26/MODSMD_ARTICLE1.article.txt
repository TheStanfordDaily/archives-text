# STANFORD WINS THE DEBATE.
## Score for the Intercollegiate Debat= ing Cup is Tied. Strong Argument and Skillful Presentation of the Stanford Speakers Prove Disastrous to the Berkeley Team. 
### 
The score of the Intercollegiate
Debates now stands three to two in
Stanford's favor. Witness the fol
lowing record:
1893—Stanford.
1894 —Stanford.
1895 —Berkeley.
1890 — Berkeley.
1897 —Stanford.
It was made so Saturday night
in Metropolitan Temple when the
three debaters of the University of
California met defeat at the hands
of the three whom Stanford had
chosen for this event. In every re
spect —' both as regards argument
and manner of presentation," the
decision read —the Stanford team
proved itself to be far superior to
that of Berkeley, and our debaters
showed as well as any three repre
sentative students could that Stan
ford is possessed of at least her small
quotum of '"brains" along with her
superiority in athletics and other
forms of contest.
The question was/'Resolved,That
each member of the Cabinet should
have a seat and a voice in Con
gress." By the Cabinet was meant
the Secretaries of State, War, Navy,
Treasury, Interior, and Agricul
ture, the Postmaster-General, and
the Attorney-General. "Seat and
voice" were not construed to mean
possessing a vote, but to mean that
the Cabinet member may, on being
summoned or voluntarily, speak
upon the floor of either house.
The speakers for the affirmative
were Charles C. Colin, Adolph L.
Weil, and Harry A. Overstreet of
the University of California; those
of the negative were Miss Londa L
Stebhins, John M. Switzer, and
A B. Morgan of Stanford Univer
sity. The judges were Judge Niles
Searles, Col. John P. Irish, and Mr.
James 11. Deeringof San Francisco.
President Martin Kellogg of the
University of California presided
over the debate.
Mr. Charles C. Colin was the first
speaker on the affirmative. He
outlined the question, defining its
limits and laying out the basis on
which it was to be interpreted. The
proposition, he maintained was not
in tiie nature of a constitutional
change, nor did it contemplate
more than a modification of an ex
isting system. The present scheme
of organization was inadequate and
it was to remedy certain evils in
this that the new measure was de
signed. The present system was in
adequate, in the first place, because
of lack of sufficient communication
between the Cabinet and Congress.
This led inevitably to the enact
ment of legislation without suffi
cient knowledge on the part of Con
gress of what was needed and what
should be done. The legislative
branch needs the presence of an au

thority in order to put into effect
laws that shall be of benefit. It re
sults, furthermore, in legislation
without knowledge of the needs of
the administration. Congress can
not avail itself of any knowledge of
the requirements of the secretaries.
In the third place, the present
system makes it impossible for
Congress to fix the responsibility
for objectionable legislation. The
work is done through the commit
tees entirely, and no one is respon
sible. And finally, it results in a
preponderance of sectional legisla
tion. National legislation suffers
because there is no one in Congress
to make it of prime and pressing
importance.
To remedy these evils the new
system proposes to confer upon the
members of the Cabinet two rights :
first,to appear on the floor of either
house, and second, to urge legisla
tion. They will be there to give
information relative to measures
that are being considered. It is
not a revolutionary measure, nor
is it opposed to the genius of Amer
ican institutions. ■
Miss Londa L. Stebhins was
heartily cheered when she stepped
to the front of the rostrum to con
tinue the debate for the negative.
She made a telling hit in her open
ing sentence, when she said that
the preceding speaker instead of
exaggerating the effects of the pro
posal had minimized its impor
tance. 1 n substance the speaker had
said that it was not intended that
the measure should have any great
and far-reaching effects, but the
negative would maintain that it is
not intentions but ultimate conse
quences to which attention should
be given.
The plan of attack would be as
follows : The first speaker would
contend that the system was op
posed to the theory of the Consti
tution ; the second speaker would
reply to the strictures on the lack
of information ; and the third
speaker would argue that it would
result in a form of government con
trary to the entire course of our
constitutional development.
Taking up her argument, Miss
Stebhins contended that the found
ers of the Constitution drew it with
a distinct line between the different
departments of government. Each
department stands on its own
ground, and the system, if adopted,
would destroy this balance of au
thority. Furthermore, the change
is not needed, because we already
have a system better, through the
Speaker of the House, who is the
acknowledged leader of Congress
and whose policy dictates every
thing. But his power is not dan
gerous because it is checked by
responsibility. In a country like

\merica its policy must be fre
quently reviewed. This is now
possible through the biennial elec
tion of members of Congress who are
responsible to the people. But if
the Cabinet officers controlled the
country's policy changes could be
made only once in four years, and
they would be responsible only to
the President. The affirmative as
sert their desire to remedy minor
and less important defects in the
governmental system ; but their
proposal would change inevitably
the entire form of government.
A. L. Weil, following for the af
firmative, spoke of the advantages
of the new system. These would
he, in the first place, to Congress:
through increased information,
through a resulting decrease in the
amount of sectional legislation, and
through a general improvement in
the execution of the laws. In the
second place, there would be a
great advantage in forming a con
necting link between the commit
tees and between both houses. In
the third place there would be an
improvement in the executive de
partment.
John M. Switzer, appearing sec
ond for Stanford, made a strong
and eloquent speech. He spoke
rapidly, but clearly, and summed
up the points in a way that added
much weight to the argument. He
contended first, that this proposi
tion must have very grave reasons
for its adoption, great demands
must be made upon it, else no such
radical departure would ever have
been contemplated. Concerning
the matter of information, Congress
was declared to have all the infor
mation it desired and all that could
be obtained. The President sends
annual messages and reports to
Congress and so do the secretaries.
The President through his veto
power ac's as a third house of leg
islation and has already enough
power and influence in directing
legislation. A further extension of
his power would be dangerous. If
a bill were brought up for passage
over the President's veto the whole
power of the Cabinet would be
against it. More than this the
Cabinet frames no policy or meas
ures ; it is responsible not to the
people but to the executive. So
that it is unjustifiable to give this
power to men who have not re
ceived the suffrage of a single citi
zen.
Berkeley depended much on
Overstreet, and he made the best
speech <>112 the affirmative side. He
maintained that they were required
to prove only that it is a needed
reform. It is not a change in con
stitutional government, nor would
it accomplish a subversion of our
constitutional organization. Con
gress does not get the information
it needs. The new system will
make legislation more unified, more
intelligent, and more adapted to
the great and growing needs of the
nation.
A. B. Morgan, the last speaker
; for Stanford, made a telling speech.
. His apt illustrations and concise
statement of points militated great
|ly to Stanford's advantage. In be
ginning he emphasized the point
| that every presumption was in
favor of the negative.

The machinery of our govern
ment is the outgrowth of long ex
perience. There have been great
changes in other parts of it, but
none in this throughout the whole
of its history. Now it is proposed
to make a change the inevitable
results of which will be dangerous
in the extierne. Certain tendencies
which the system indicates will ag
grandize the power of the Cabinet.
First among these is that there will
come about a change in the selec
tion of members of the Cabinet.
They will be chosen not for their
executive ability but for their per
suasive power in debate. And
secondly, federal patronage will
control lhe selection of these secre
taries The extension of the power
of the Cabinet by these means will
likewise increase the power of the
President. The right of initiating
legislation will go to the Cabinet
and I'res dent. This extension of
power will run contrary to the
course of our institutional develop
ment, and will also be incompati
ble with the other functions of
Cabinet officers. The veto will be
come a sword of menace to force
through any policy in the mind of
the administration.
The affirmative make much of
the assertion that better legislation
will be secured by reason of better
information. But they slight the
fact that the manner of giving this
information will be completely
changed. Now information is
given to inform, but under the new
system facts will he marshalled to
persuade. The head of each de
partment will magnify the impor
tance of his own functions.
The negative has shown that the
change is unnecessary and that it
is inexpedient. There is not now
any nation on the face of the earth
in which the members of the exec
utive branch are allowed to sit in
the legislative hall and also exer
cise the veto power. Our system is
the oldest and most venerable and
has to the largest extent the quali
ties of permanence.
Overstreet, contrary to the inter
collegiate agreement, closed the
debate. He attempted to sum up
the points made by either side, and
closed with a protest against the
style of argument followed by his
j opponents.
The judges retired to deliberate,
and returned in less than five min
utes with the decision, which was
delivered by Judge Searles. He
said in making the announcement
that the judges, having to decide
j on the two points of argument and
| manner of presentation, had agreed
j that on both the award should go
! to Stanford.
The announcement was received
with manifestations of the wildest
enthusiasm. Though the Field-day
was lost the Debate was won, and
the Stanford crowd came home
bearing in triumph the silver cup,
which won once more, becomes their
j own for all time.
The score of the Intercollegiate
Debates now stands three to two in

The judges retired to deliberate,
and returned in less than five min
utes with the decision, which was
delivered by Judge Searles. He
said in making the announcement
that the judges, having to decide
j on the two points of argument and
| manner of presentation, had agreed
j that on both the award should go
! to Stanford.
The announcement was received
with manifestations of the wildest
enthusiasm. Though the Field-day
was lost the Debate was won, and
the Stanford crowd came home
bearing in triumph the silver cup,
which won once more, becomes their
j own for all time.
The score of the Intercollegiate
Debates now stands three to two in
Stanford's favor. Witness the fol
lowing record:
1893—Stanford.
1894 —Stanford.
1895 —Berkeley.
1890 — Berkeley.
1897 —Stanford.
It was made so Saturday night
in Metropolitan Temple when the
three debaters of the University of
California met defeat at the hands
of the three whom Stanford had
chosen for this event. In every re
spect —' both as regards argument
and manner of presentation," the
decision read —the Stanford team
proved itself to be far superior to
that of Berkeley, and our debaters
showed as well as any three repre
sentative students could that Stan
ford is possessed of at least her small
quotum of '"brains" along with her
superiority in athletics and other
forms of contest.
The question was/'Resolved,That
each member of the Cabinet should
have a seat and a voice in Con
gress." By the Cabinet was meant
the Secretaries of State, War, Navy,
Treasury, Interior, and Agricul
ture, the Postmaster-General, and
the Attorney-General. "Seat and
voice" were not construed to mean
possessing a vote, but to mean that
the Cabinet member may, on being
summoned or voluntarily, speak
upon the floor of either house.
The speakers for the affirmative
were Charles C. Colin, Adolph L.
Weil, and Harry A. Overstreet of
the University of California; those
of the negative were Miss Londa L
Stebhins, John M. Switzer, and
A B. Morgan of Stanford Univer
sity. The judges were Judge Niles
Searles, Col. John P. Irish, and Mr.
James 11. Deeringof San Francisco.
President Martin Kellogg of the
University of California presided
over the debate.
Mr. Charles C. Colin was the first
speaker on the affirmative. He
outlined the question, defining its
limits and laying out the basis on
which it was to be interpreted. The
proposition, he maintained was not
in tiie nature of a constitutional
change, nor did it contemplate
more than a modification of an ex
isting system. The present scheme
of organization was inadequate and
it was to remedy certain evils in
this that the new measure was de
signed. The present system was in
adequate, in the first place, because
of lack of sufficient communication
between the Cabinet and Congress.
This led inevitably to the enact
ment of legislation without suffi
cient knowledge on the part of Con
gress of what was needed and what
should be done. The legislative
branch needs the presence of an au

thority in order to put into effect
laws that shall be of benefit. It re
sults, furthermore, in legislation
without knowledge of the needs of
the administration. Congress can
not avail itself of any knowledge of
the requirements of the secretaries.
In the third place, the present
system makes it impossible for
Congress to fix the responsibility
for objectionable legislation. The
work is done through the commit
tees entirely, and no one is respon
sible. And finally, it results in a
preponderance of sectional legisla
tion. National legislation suffers
because there is no one in Congress
to make it of prime and pressing
importance.
To remedy these evils the new
system proposes to confer upon the
members of the Cabinet two rights :
first,to appear on the floor of either
house, and second, to urge legisla
tion. They will be there to give
information relative to measures
that are being considered. It is
not a revolutionary measure, nor
is it opposed to the genius of Amer
ican institutions. ■
Miss Londa L. Stebhins was
heartily cheered when she stepped
to the front of the rostrum to con
tinue the debate for the negative.
She made a telling hit in her open
ing sentence, when she said that
the preceding speaker instead of
exaggerating the effects of the pro
posal had minimized its impor
tance. 1 n substance the speaker had
said that it was not intended that
the measure should have any great
and far-reaching effects, but the
negative would maintain that it is
not intentions but ultimate conse
quences to which attention should
be given.
The plan of attack would be as
follows : The first speaker would
contend that the system was op
posed to the theory of the Consti
tution ; the second speaker would
reply to the strictures on the lack
of information ; and the third
speaker would argue that it would
result in a form of government con
trary to the entire course of our
constitutional development.
Taking up her argument, Miss
Stebhins contended that the found
ers of the Constitution drew it with
a distinct line between the different
departments of government. Each
department stands on its own
ground, and the system, if adopted,
would destroy this balance of au
thority. Furthermore, the change
is not needed, because we already
have a system better, through the
Speaker of the House, who is the
acknowledged leader of Congress
and whose policy dictates every
thing. But his power is not dan
gerous because it is checked by
responsibility. In a country like

\merica its policy must be fre
quently reviewed. This is now
possible through the biennial elec
tion of members of Congress who are
responsible to the people. But if
the Cabinet officers controlled the
country's policy changes could be
made only once in four years, and
they would be responsible only to
the President. The affirmative as
sert their desire to remedy minor
and less important defects in the
governmental system ; but their
proposal would change inevitably
the entire form of government.
A. L. Weil, following for the af
firmative, spoke of the advantages
of the new system. These would
he, in the first place, to Congress:
through increased information,
through a resulting decrease in the
amount of sectional legislation, and
through a general improvement in
the execution of the laws. In the
second place, there would be a
great advantage in forming a con
necting link between the commit
tees and between both houses. In
the third place there would be an
improvement in the executive de
partment.
John M. Switzer, appearing sec
ond for Stanford, made a strong
and eloquent speech. He spoke
rapidly, but clearly, and summed
up the points in a way that added
much weight to the argument. He
contended first, that this proposi
tion must have very grave reasons
for its adoption, great demands
must be made upon it, else no such
radical departure would ever have
been contemplated. Concerning
the matter of information, Congress
was declared to have all the infor
mation it desired and all that could
be obtained. The President sends
annual messages and reports to
Congress and so do the secretaries.
The President through his veto
power ac's as a third house of leg
islation and has already enough
power and influence in directing
legislation. A further extension of
his power would be dangerous. If
a bill were brought up for passage
over the President's veto the whole
power of the Cabinet would be
against it. More than this the
Cabinet frames no policy or meas
ures ; it is responsible not to the
people but to the executive. So
that it is unjustifiable to give this
power to men who have not re
ceived the suffrage of a single citi
zen.
Berkeley depended much on
Overstreet, and he made the best
speech <>112 the affirmative side. He
maintained that they were required
to prove only that it is a needed
reform. It is not a change in con
stitutional government, nor would
it accomplish a subversion of our
constitutional organization. Con
gress does not get the information
it needs. The new system will
make legislation more unified, more
intelligent, and more adapted to
the great and growing needs of the
nation.
A. B. Morgan, the last speaker
; for Stanford, made a telling speech.
. His apt illustrations and concise
statement of points militated great
|ly to Stanford's advantage. In be
ginning he emphasized the point
| that every presumption was in
favor of the negative.

The machinery of our govern
ment is the outgrowth of long ex
perience. There have been great
changes in other parts of it, but
none in this throughout the whole
of its history. Now it is proposed
to make a change the inevitable
results of which will be dangerous
in the extierne. Certain tendencies
which the system indicates will ag
grandize the power of the Cabinet.
First among these is that there will
come about a change in the selec
tion of members of the Cabinet.
They will be chosen not for their
executive ability but for their per
suasive power in debate. And
secondly, federal patronage will
control lhe selection of these secre
taries The extension of the power
of the Cabinet by these means will
likewise increase the power of the
President. The right of initiating
legislation will go to the Cabinet
and I'res dent. This extension of
power will run contrary to the
course of our institutional develop
ment, and will also be incompati
ble with the other functions of
Cabinet officers. The veto will be
come a sword of menace to force
through any policy in the mind of
the administration.
The affirmative make much of
the assertion that better legislation
will be secured by reason of better
information. But they slight the
fact that the manner of giving this
information will be completely
changed. Now information is
given to inform, but under the new
system facts will he marshalled to
persuade. The head of each de
partment will magnify the impor
tance of his own functions.
The negative has shown that the
change is unnecessary and that it
is inexpedient. There is not now
any nation on the face of the earth
in which the members of the exec
utive branch are allowed to sit in
the legislative hall and also exer
cise the veto power. Our system is
the oldest and most venerable and
has to the largest extent the quali
ties of permanence.
Overstreet, contrary to the inter
collegiate agreement, closed the
debate. He attempted to sum up
the points made by either side, and
closed with a protest against the
style of argument followed by his
j opponents.

and returned in less than five min
