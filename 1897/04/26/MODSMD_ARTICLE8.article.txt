The outcome of the two intercol
legiate contests day before yester
day can not but be gratifying to
Stanford, even though one of them
resulted in her defeat. This was si
critical year for us in debate. Vic
tory for Berkeley not only meant
the loss of the cup to us, but it
would have filled us with a certain
feeling of discouragement as well.
Those who had the welfare of our
debating interests at heart faced a
very practical problem. The idea
was rapidly being spread abroad in
s<>ni-.' mysterious way that Stanford
had a student body made up of
"farmers,"who would do well enough
to push through a line, but that
Berkeley alone attracted men of
exquisite polish and magnificent
brain power. We hope that this
opinion may now suffer a reaction.
The fact is, Stanford has never
been wanting in material capable
of coping with our forensic rivals
across the bay. It only needed a
re-awakening to draw out the tal
ent that lay latent in our midst.
Let this renaissance of interest but
be maintained at its present level
and Berkeley's victories on the
platform will in the future be as
scarce as in the past they have
been on the gridiron.
