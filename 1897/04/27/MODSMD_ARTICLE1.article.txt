# TRACK TEAM DEFEATED.
## Berkeley Wins the Intercollegiate Field-Day with Points to Spare. 
### 
The Varsity track team met the
team of California last Saturday at
the Olympic grounds and was de
feated by the score of 49 1-2 to
(i2 1-2. The day was replete with
surprises. Many of the men who
were thought to be sure of firsts
disappointed their admirers, while
others did better than was expected.
Stanford was unfortunate in her
first-place men. Brunton and Bur
nett failed to get their places in
their respective events, while sev
eral second-place men got nothing
belter than thirds.
The first surprise was the 880-yd.
run, in which Carroll of U. C. took
first place over Burnett. The lat
ter ran a very plucky race, but was
not equal to the remarkable time of
2:00 2-5 made by the winner.
Walker, who promised to be a sec
ond-place man in the event,fainted
at the finish.
The climax of Stanford's misfor
tune was in the hundred, where
Johnny Brunton, who was conceded
a sure first, took but second place.
The time was 10 1-5, much slower
than Brunton had made at any
time during the hist two or three
weeks of his training. This, to
gether with Brunton's other per
formances in events where he was
counted a sure winner, confirms the
opinion, which was universal before
the game, that he was very much
over-trained. In ordinary trim he
should esisily have captured the
220-yd. dash, which went at 28 2-5
seconds. The inevitable conclu
sion is that Brunton was too fine
for the speedy work of which he is
capable.
Dole, captain of the team, made
a brilliant record, having to his
credit fifteen of Stanford's points.
He took firsts in the pole-vault, the
high jump, and 220-yd. hurdle.
He did not enter the clashes.
One of the greatest surprises of
the day was the 16-1 b. hammer
throw, in which Stanford secured
three places with Ilazzard, Fickert,
and Freeman. In this event first
place was generally conceded to
Berkeley, but Dorn could not make
more than 110 feet.
Several new marks were estab
lished —Morgan in the 120-yd. hur
dles at 16 flat over the former rec
ord of 16 1-5; Broughton in the
broad jump equalling the record at
22 feet; Dole in the pole-vault at
10:10 over 10:61-2; Drum in the44o
at 51; Carroll in the 880 at 2:00 2-5.
