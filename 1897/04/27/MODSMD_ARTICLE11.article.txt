In discussing the Field-day we
hear on every hand the remark,
" Victory can not always be ours."
This is philosophy. Though we
lost, we did our best. We were
over-confident for the first time in
our athletic history, and we have
k-an.cd a costly lesson. The blame
for the defeat rests upon the shoul
ders of no individual. Sympathy
for the defeated and honest admir
ation for the brave efforts of our
athletes, who could not do what
was expected of them, is expressed
by every one. Mr. King, our
trainer, did what he thought best,
and considering the facilities of
fered him for working, did it pos
sibly better than anyone else could.
JI is careful coaching and hard work
merit the very high esteem in
which we hold him.
