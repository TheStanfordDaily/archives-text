# The 						Junior Farce.
## 
### 
The Junior Farce of the Class of
'98 went through the hands of the
faculty committee today and came
out unscathed, much to the relief
of the juniors. Parties who have
been admitted to the last few re
hearsals of this farce are of the
opinion that it will be the best
class performance ever given here.
The juniors are trying to make an
artistic production, and to that end
they have been working faithfully
the past month. The farce touches
a field never covered by any preced
ing production of its kind —the in
teresting subject of football. There
is a realistic scene wherein the hero
is carried in by a frantic mob, after
a football victory, and the play
ends with a unique football pro
posal.
As regards the actors, Mcintosh
as "Uncle," the returned cattle
king, Deuel as the "bardlet," Miss
Hearne and Miss Hyde as the in
<jenue and chaperon are particu
larly effective.
Seats will be on sale at the post
office tomorrow and Thursday from
10:30 to 12 and from 1:30 to 4.
Prices are fifty and twenty-five
cents.
