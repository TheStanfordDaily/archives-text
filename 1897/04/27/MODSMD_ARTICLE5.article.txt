# WOMAN'S CONGRESS MEETS.
## Fourth Annual Gathering Welcomed in an Address by President Jordan. 
### 
The fourth annual meeting of the
Woman's Congress was opened in
San Francisco yesterday. The
Congress has brought together
many persons of note, among them
Mrs. Helen A. Gardner of New
York, and Brahmacharin Bodhab
hikshu, the Hindu philosopher.
Many of the professors of Stanford
and of the University of California
will take part.
The president of the congress,
Mrs. John F. Swift, called the meet
ing to order, which was opened
with prayer by Rev. George C.
Adams.
The Rev. Dr. George E. Walk
delivered the address of welcome.
He referred to the fact that he was
the son of the first Southern minis
ter who thirty years ago advocated
equal suffrage. He said there was
no longer a "woman's question"; it
was humanity's question of equal
rights for all and exclusive privi
leges for none.
Mayor Phelan in a pleasant ad
dress extended the liberty of the
city to the visitors.
President Jordan was the next
spe;iker. He spoke in his usual
happy style, somewhat as follows:
"For the most part in the past,
woman has been working under
sealed orders, attending only to the
little things of life, and permitting
men to take charge of the larger
tilings. It was only the natural
result of acting under sealed or
ders. As Bret Harte put it: 'Wo
man is two thirds poet and the
other third what chance and mar
riage make her.' The spirit of de
mocracy is the breaking of sealed
orders. In breaking them we do it
for weal or woe. There are some
men who would be better if they
worked all their lives under sealed
orders.
"Democracy exists for individual
development. The effect of democ
racy is to make better men, al
though not better government.
"With the breaking of sealed or
ders for men they have been broken
for women. We may not have bet
ter government by reason of wo
man's participation, but the time
has come when they should and
will know more of the government
under which they live. The need
of woman's influence is the strong
est plea for her full freedom.
"The influence of women is fully
as important as that of men, and
and most of it is for the future.
The history of California is being
written in the public schools, but
back of them are the home and the
mother. The school is but an ex
tension of the home, and so must
the importance of woman's influ
ence be considered. Her stamp
must be a permanent one for mor
ality of the mind and body. A na
tion can not be greater than its
morals. The work of the future
must be accomplished by individ
uals."
Mrs. John F. Swift, the president,
followed in an appropriate address.
In the afternoon Prof. Bailey spoke
on "Child study and reverence."
At the evening session Mrs.
Louise Maitland of Stanford read
a paper on "The development of
children as seen in their drawings."

Her paper was the result of exper
iments in color conducted by Prof.
Barnes at Stanford. The experi
ments showed that blue was the
favorite color of children, and that
girls were superior to boys in color
discrimination. She also showed
that children should be given a va
riety of colors to play with, accord
ing to their fancy.
Prof. Barnes delivered a paper on
"Children's ideas of punishment."
In his address he held that the
great difficulty in dealing with
children lay in finding activity for
the pent-up energy of the child.
"The majority of the child's of
fenses are purely negative, consist
ing of things the child did not do.
To deal with children requires in
finite patience. It is no use to lay
down a law; a primary school with
laws and regulations is an absurd
ity. Laws and regulations are for
older people. Progress points out
that laws are useless in early child
hood, and that intelligent self-di
rection can begin on the part of
the child when about ten years old."
The following subjects will be
treated by Stanford professors in
the remaining sessions of the Con
gress: Wednesday afternoon —Miss
Estelle M. Darrah, "The child's
feelings for the beautiful"; evening
Prof. E. A. Ross, "Education for
enjoyment and culture"; Thursday
—Prof. J. M. Stillman, "The essen
tial character and purpose of
higher education"; Friday —Dr. T.
I). Wood, "Personal hygiene"; Prof.
A. Ct. Newcomer, "Books and mor
als"; evening—President Jordan,
/The joys of sanity."
