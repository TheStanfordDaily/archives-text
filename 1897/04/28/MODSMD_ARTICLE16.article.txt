We are now on the down grade
toward the end of the semester.
Our professors have been of the
opinion that we devote too much
time to journalism and too little to
our University work, and so now
we shall have to reverse the order
and do something that will count
toward graduation. That we have
given much care and attention to
the Daily Palo Alto is true, and
we should be sorry if it should suf
fer by the change: we hope that it
may not. Hut the present neces
sity is more real than apparent.
