# Senior Finances.
## 
### 
The finance committee of the
Senior Class met in u second long
session last night. Steps were taken
toward realizing upon the Annual
assets. â€¢ The collection of the $5.00
assessment is being pushed forward
in an energetic way. A thorough
canvass of the class has been made
and either a payment or a promise
to pay obtained from nearly all the
members. The double burden of
the debt and Commencement Week
will not fall upon a few, but with
very few exceptions the assessment
will be paid by every member of
the class. After the first week in
May a full list of all who have paid
and the statement of the class
finances will be made public.
