The plan has often heen sug
gested recently of re-electing a
member of the present Executive
Committee so that there may he on
the committee next year someone
who is familiar with the policy
pursued by this year's committee.
It is not likely that anyone who has
served on that committee for one
year and has devoted the time to
the duties of the office which a
seme of his responsibility to the
student body demands, will ever
consent to a repetition of his year's
experience. There can be no doubt,
however, that the student body
loses by starting out each year with
an entirely new committee. This
loss might be done away with to a
certain extent by electing a part of
the members in December, so as to
form a sort of connecting link be
tween the committees of two differ
ent years. This plan would give
an opportunity for the students at
large to elect a freshman member
one semester after the entrance of
each class, and would doubtless
prove advantageous in many other
w a\ s.
