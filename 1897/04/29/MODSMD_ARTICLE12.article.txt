# That Summer Outing.
## 
### 
"Where shall the summer vaca
tion be spent?" is a question upper
most in the consideration of many
students and members of the fac
ulty at this time; nor is it easily
answered without an exhaustive
canvass of the numerous retreats
within the confines of the state.
However, there are those within
easy reach of the University whose
claims are well known and appre
ciated by a host of people. Among
the number Cazadero, tlie famous
big tree resort, and Lytton Springs,
California's ideal sanitarium and
rest resort, remain unrivaled in
their varied attractions. Nature
has done so much for these places.
The one, the home of the trout and
the haunt of the deer, in the shade
of a 1300 acre tract of the giant
sequoia, traversed by picturesque
Austin Creek; the other with its
broad acres of hills and valley, its
soda and seltzer springs, its mag
nificent scenery, its perfect appli
ances, baths, eic. —all in beautiful
Sonoma County, easy of access,
without transfer or staging.
Cazadero is limitless in point of
resource. A week is all tot) short
for exploration of the beauties of
hill, dale, and brook, to say noth
ing of the boundless offers of
novelty made by the adjacent
mountains and coast. A number
from the University were there last
summer.
At Lytton Springs the health
seeker, and those in <juest of rest
and (piiet, will find a perfect ar
rangement —the main building
with pleasant cottages clustered
about, heated with steam and
lighted by gas, the ample grounds,
wooded hill-sides, pure spring and
mineral waters, the entire freedom
from the demands of society and
fashion, provision for recreation
and amusement, faithful attend
ants, skilled physicians, — in fact
everything that is conducive to a
delightful season of rest and re
cuperation.
The management of Lytton
Springs quotes a rate of $8.00 to
$12.50 per week without treatment,
and at Cazadero $8.00 to $14.00 per
week, with special rates to families.
The San Francisco office of these
resorts is at 218 McAllister street.
