# JUNIOR CLASS CELEBRATES.
## The 						Class of '98 Presents an Excellent Farce and Gives a Very Successful Prom. 
### 
The Class of '98 held the annual
Junior Class functions on Thurs
day and Friday evenings. The
farce was given Thursday evening
in the gymnasium and the prom,
followed Friday evening. Hereto
fore the Junior Class has had a day
set apart for its festivities, but as
this was not granted this year, two
days were necessary in which to
have the farce and promenade.
THE FARCE.
The Junior Farce, "The Conver
sion of Uncle," written by Will H.
Irwin, was given in the Encina
gymnasium Thursday evening be
fore a crowded house. The per
formance was a success in every re
spect. being pronounced the best
farce ever produced on the campus,
both in point of composition and
presentation. The farce was in it
self one of great merit, and the
management was particularly for
tunate in the selection of the cast.
The honors of the play doubtless
belong to Mr. Mcintosh as Uncle
Jason Tubbs, the Arizona rancher.
Mr. Mcintosh made the part as
realistic as the author could have
wished. His dialect and manner
isms were perfect. Miss Virginia
Hearne's part as Mabel Marsden,
in love with Uncle Jason's lost
nephew, Harry Hunter, was done
in excellent style. Mr. George
Francis as Hunter made quite a
hit, and Mr. Deuel's characteriza
tion of the Sequoia bardlet kept the
house in a continual roar. The
part was well taken and well ren
dered.
The minor characters of the play
could not have been better chosen.
The entire cast showed the effect of
conscientious preparation for the
play.
