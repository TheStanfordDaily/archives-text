Fok the first time iti the history
of intercollegiate baseball Stanford
has lost the championship and
Berkeley has shaken off the tradi

we pride ourselves on losing with
good grace. Wo can not but give our
rival credit for her victory. She
had the better team beyond a
doubt, and beat us fairly and
squarely.
