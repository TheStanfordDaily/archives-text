We shall issue on May* 26 a
twelve-page Commencement edition
containing a complete record of the
events of Commencement Week and
of the graduating class. The edi
tion will be gotten up with great
care and will contain a large num
ber of illustrations, arrangements
for which are now being made.
One of the features of this edition
will be the year's calendar, being
an account of the year's work
gathered from the tiles of the Daily
Palo Alto and from other sources.
Tins will make the edition one of
great value to those who have spent
this year at the University, as well
as to those who have been away
from it. The edition will be out on
Commencement Day, May 26.
Copies may now be ordered.
