# CHAMPIONSHIP LEAVES US.
## Berkeley Defeats Stanford at Baseball and Wins the Season's Championship. 
### 
The third and final game of
baseball between Stanford and U. C.
was played in San Francisco Sat
urday and was won by U. C. by
the score of 20 to 10. This gives
Berkeley the baseball championship
for the first time since the two uni
versities have played together.
Stanford won the championship in
'92, '93, '94, '95, and '96. The sil
ver trophy offered by the Univer
sity Club of San Francisco, to go to
the club first winning four series,
will have to be competed for again.
The principle features of the game
were the big scores. Both teams
indulged in heavy batting and
poor fielding. The Berkeley men
hit Beckett so hard that in the
sixth inning he was taken out and
Ruddell was subtituted. Ruddell
was a little wild at first, but settled
down and pitched a good game.
Jeffs played the star game of the
day, both at the bat and in his po
sition. He made a pretty catch of
a foul fly in the seventh inning,
and otherwise fielded his position
well. For Berkeley the best work
was done by Krug and Hoag, the
former knocking two home runs
over the Eighth street fence.
The loss of the game by Stanford
can not be attributed to any one
man. Berkeley won the game by
hard hitting and the numerous er
rors of our own team. Following
is the score:
