The finances of the student body
were never in a better condition
than they are at present. Old
debts amounting to almost two
thousand dollars have been paid
this year, and the prospects arc
bright for closing the coming year
entirely free from debt. The ac
counts of individual organizations,
such as the musical clubs, are fret
also. For the first time in its his
tory the student body can look for
ward to some other use of its money
besides the payment of debts ac
cumulated in years past.
