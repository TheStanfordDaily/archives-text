# Choral Society Concert.
## 
### 
The Choral Society is to offer a
very elaborate and beautiful pro
gram at the concert Saturday night.
The Chorus itself now sings with
line tone effect and with much sym
pathy. With the Apollo Choral
Society the Chorus will number two
hundred, and the choral numbers
will include a number of part songs,
besides the loftier choruses from
the oratorios of "Elijah" and the
"Messiah," already mentioned in
the Daily Palo Alto.
The solo singers will be Mrs.
Frank L. Wratten, Mrs. Edith
Scott Basford, Mr. W. S. Edgerton,
and Mr. H. E. Medley. Mrs.
Wratten is the soprano of the
Trinity Church choir in San Fran
cisco. Site has a pure, full, and
strong voice of lovely quality, and
has sung in many concerts in San
Francisco with success. Mrs. Bas
ford, contralto, is already known at
Stanford, as is also Mr. Medley,
bdritone. Mr. Edgerton is tenor
soloist at Plymouth Congregational
Church in San Francisco, and is
first tenor of the California Quar
tette. Miss M. P. Little, Miss M.
G. Ferral, Prof. D. H. Campbell,
and Dr. G. B. Little will sing a
quartette part.
The instrumental soloists are Mr.
Otto Bendix, pianist, and Mr. Na
thaniel Landsberger, violinist. Mr.
Bendix is said to play better now
than ever before, and was for many
years regarded as one of the first
pianists in Boston. Mr. Lands
berger when in the mood is a really
great violinist, and even when the
right mood is not upon him is an
extremely good player.
The Apollo Society, which is to
unite with the Stanford Society, has
received favorable comment from
the San Francisco critics, the qual
ity of the tone produced being
spoken of as especially beautiful â€”
a rare thing with choruses.
Tickets on sale at Registrar's
office Thursday and Friday.
