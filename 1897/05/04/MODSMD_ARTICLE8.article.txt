# AMENDMENTS EXPLAINED.
## Statement from the Executive Committee with Reasons for the Changes. 
### 
Eclilor Daily Palo Alto: In J
view of the fact that the motives of
the Executive Committee in propos
ing the amendments to the student
body constitution at present under
consideration, have been misinter
preted in some quarters, we, the
members of that committee, beg
leave to submit to the student body
some of the reasons we had for pro
posing the changes.
In the first place, we wish to im
press the fact that the present Ex
ecutive Committee is not allied with
any student body faction and that
the amendments were proposed
with the approval of every mem
ber. Various changes in the pres
ent constitution had been discussed
at the meetings throughout the
year, and a short time ago a com
mittee consisting of Messrs. Leiter
and Schwartz was appointed to
prepare a draft of the amendments
it would be wise and expedient to
incorporate in the student body
constitution at this time. The
amendments drawn up by this sub
committee were agreed to by the
other members and reported with
out change at last Wednesday's
meeting of the student body.
The Executive Committee has of
fered an amendment making the
vice-president of the Associated
Students an ex officio member of the
Executive and Athletic Committees
t\>r the following reasons: 1. Ac
cording to our constitution the
vice-president assumes the office of
president if the latter office becomes
vacant. He should be prepared to
assume these duties at any time and
should be acquainted with student
body affairs and the workings of
the student body system. At pres
ent any member of the Executive
Committee would lie better prepared
to take up the thread of student
body business in the middle of the
year than the vice-president.
2. At present the vice-president
is the only officer in the student
body who has no part in the con
sideration of the student body busi
ness.
3. The vice-president is usually
a representative student whose
presence on these committees would
be valuable.
As to the election of football manag
er by the Associated Students, there
surely can be no objection. The
plan of election by boards has been
done away with in the selection of
editors-in-chief and business mana
gers of the Daily Palo Alto and
the Sequoia. It is simply an exten
sion of a principle in election which
experience has shown to be adapted
to our student body system.
The question of abolishing Qie
freshman member of the Executive
Committee is one of minor import
ance. It has often been agitated
and the Executive Committee felt
that it would be advisable to bring
it to a vote. Arguments may be
i urged on both sides, with a prepon
derance perhaps in favor of the
change.
The members of the Executive
J Committee have been closely con
nected with the practical workings
1 of our student body system for the

past year, and these amendments
are calculated to remedy several de
fects in the system which their ex
perience has shown to exist.

tee of the Associated Students:
