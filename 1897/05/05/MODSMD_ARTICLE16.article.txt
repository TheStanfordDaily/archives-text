Today's election, compared with
the contest a year ago, showed, on
the whole, less interest on the part
of the student body. This was due

in but two of ihe important offices
to be lilled. For members of the
Executive Committee candidates
were numerous, and the light was
much harder than that of a year

the enviable record that has been
made by the retiring committee.
