### 
Those who know of Mrs. Stan
ford's charities will be glad to learn
that the kindergartens which she
for many years supported in the
vicinity of Palo Alto have all been
kept up, and will perpetuate an in
fluence which is perhaps the best of
all legacies.
From 18 ( J8 to the spring of 1896
the one at May field was kept as a
private school in the home of Miss
Frances A. Hamilton, who had been
for some years its teacher. Last
February she was able to open
again a tree kindergarten in May
lield with a prospect of as large at
tendance as formerly. The Wo
man's Christian Temperance Union
has undertaken its support by col
lecting monthly subscriptions in
the town and vicinity. Their ef
forts have been very materially
aided by entertainments given
monthly by the young people of the
town for the benefit of the tree kin
dergarten. 1l is hoped by these
means, and such donations as may
come voluntarily, to keep the school
alive until a tax can be obtained
for its support.
