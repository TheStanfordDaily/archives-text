week with still less claim to esteem
than it had in its last issue. It has
reached a stage of decadence that
entitles it to no representation or
supj ort whatever from university

publish university notes, comment,
and humor, and asserts that its
work is appreciated "as shown I>v
the hundreds of subscribers at
Stanford and California."
