# Yale Loses Her Mascot.

### 
Yale is mourning the loss of her
great mascot, "Handsome Dan,''
who died recently in England.
Dan was a bulldog and wore the
blue ribbon for Yale, lie was al
ways taken to games in a leash,
and the. Harvard football team
owed its existence for years to the
fact that the rope held.
The Philadelphia Press sketches
the dog's career as follows: "To all
lovers of dogs throughout the coun
try, and to Yale men especially,
the news of the death of Handsome
Dan in London will bring back a
crowd of memories. Dan was a
magnificent specimen of the Eng
lish bulldog, and for several years
has figured regularly as the Yale
mascot at all the big football and
baseball games in which Yale has
played. One would need only to
glance over the athletic record of
this university to appreciate the po
sition which Dan holds in the
hearts of Yale, lie was the hero
of their heroes, and the appearance
of his battle-scarred countenance

on the football field never failed to
draw forth a cheer.
"l)an was born ten years ago,
and was bought when a puppy by
Andy Graves, a Yale graduate of
'93. A favorite trick was to tell
him to 'speak to Harvard.' He
j would hark ferociously and work
himself into physical contortions of
rage never before dreamed of by a
dog. Dan was peculiar to himself
in one thing â€”he would never asso
ciate with any one but students.
Dan implanted himself more firmly
in the hearts of Yale students than
any mascot had ever done before,
and was a prime favorite with
everyone in college."
