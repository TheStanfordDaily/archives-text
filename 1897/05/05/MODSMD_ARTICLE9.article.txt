# LECTURE ON HEREDITY.
## Helen Gardner Discusses the Subject From the Standpoint of Morals. 
### 
There was a very iarge audience
in the chapel last night to hear
Helen E. Gardner. She gave a
short, practical talk on the subject
"Heredity."
She said the question she was to
discuss was one of the most import
ant of the many confronting hu
manity at the present time. There is
no question as to the fact of the in
fluence of heredity, hut the dispute
has been over the method used by
nature in effecting it.
Mrs. Gardner told of the results
of investigations among the New
York physicians as to whether ac
quired diseases could be transmit
ted by parents to children. The
physicians were unanimous in the
belief that the children were affected.
But while the course and law are
absolutely certain, the operation is
as the March wind.
But heredity is not the whole
story. The question of environ
ment plays an important part. Ap
ples can not become potatoes â€”he-
redity looks out for that; nor will
they become Malaga grapes. But
environment, care or abuse, will
make them good apples or poor.
The law of heredity is sure to
operate, not only in the transmis
mission of physical diseases but
also of mental and moral. But in
telligent and wise care can do much
to ameliorate the condition of those
born under disadvantages.
