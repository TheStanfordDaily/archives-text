Ever since Stanford first opened
its doors almost six years ago its
student body lias been drawn very
largely from the states east of the
Rocky Mountains. The cause of
this has often been asked and Pres
ident .Jordan recently addressed a
letter to each of the students from
the East now in the University ask
ing what reasons led him to come
to Palo Alto. The statistics com
piled from these answers were pub
lished in last Sunday's Chronicle
and give some interesting details in
regard to the students here. The

main attractions seem to be (lie
elective system, the Stanford corps
of teachers, and California. A
few queer replies were given, such
as the one in which the reason
stated was that the writer had heard
Stanford called a "godless institu
tion" and wanted to bring his God
and establish his dominion here.
It appears that the coming of East
ern students here is not likely to
diminish and that Stanford will
still remain one of the most cosmo
politan of universities.
