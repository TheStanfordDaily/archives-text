# For the Study of German.

The Association of Teachers of
German in California, of which Dr.
Julius Goebel is president, is mak
ing an effort to have German made
elective with Latin in the high
schools of the state. The Associa
tion is composed of the professors
of German in hoth universities and
of teachers of German in various
high schools and private institu
tions of California. In making an
investigation of the condition of the
instruction of German in secondary
schools, it was found that only in
35 ot the 86 high schools is German
taught at the present time. It was
further developed that of 7163
pupils taught in these 35 schools,
only 918, or less than 12 per cent...
were taking German, while all of
the 7163 pupils receive instruction
in Latin.
In view of these facts the Associa
tion calls attention to a number of
practical considerations. There are
in the first place many reasons why
a knowledge of German is becom
ing necessary. The large per
centage of the German population
in (his country, and the commer
cial relations between America and
Germany make a knowledge of the
German language of much impor
tance. In business centres, also,
young men and women who com
mand the German language are
usually preferred when seeking
positions to those who do not
understand Germ an.
Aside from these reasons, for
work in the University German is
almost indispensable. There is at
the present time no branch of
science in which Germany does not
indisputably take the foremost
place among European nations.
In the words of President Gil man
of Johns Hopkins University: "As
Latin was during the Middle Ages
the language of scholars, so the
knowledge of German is now in
dispensable for anyone claiming the
name of a student and scholar."
Taking all things into account,
the Association makes a plea for
the introduction of German in the
high schools of California. It does
not ask that German be substituted
for Latin, but that they should be
put on an equal footing.
