# WHY EASTERN STUDENTS COME TO STANFORD.
## Article by President Jordan—The Result of Inquiry Among Students Who Come Here From Beyond the Rockies. 
### 
Last winter in si hotel lit Wash
ington I met four Stanford gradu
ates resident in the East, and the
conversation turned on the ques
tion, "Why do Eastern students go
to Stanford University?"' In each
of these four cases personal know
ledge of the work of some individual
professor was the deciding cause.
While in the East 1 was almost
daily asked the same question by n
very large number of people. 01
course 1 could answer in general
terms, the climate of California,
the ideals of the University, the
reputation of its professors, the
desire to travel, the elecive system —
but the relative force of these influ
ences could not he definitely given.
When the University was opened
in 1891 the members of its upper
classes were nearly all from Eastern
colleges. 11 was evident that most
of these were drawn through their
acquaintance with individual pro
fessors. Others were attracted by
the romantic and touching history
of the founding of the University,
and still others by the charm of
California. Since that time these
men who knew the members of the
original faculty in the East have all
graduated. The university has
made something of a record of one
kind or another. It has suffered
from hostile conditions wholly un
foreseen, and the present body of
Eastern students has entered the
University during the period of its
adversity. Of the 1091 students
registered in 1897, 729 are given as
resident in California, 58 in Oregon,
and 35 in Washington,25 are from
foreign countries, and 240 from the
States east of the Rocky Mountains
—Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New
York, lowa, Pennsylvania, Missouri,
Ohio, Minnesota, New Jersey, Mass
achusetts, and the District of Col
umbia furnishing the most of these
and standing in the order given.
To each of these students the fol
lowing letter of inquiry was ad
dressed :
"1 have been hundreds of times
asked this question: 'For what rea
sons do Eastern students come to
Stanford University?' As a basis
fora statistical answer to this ques
tion will you kindly state in a few
words on the back of this sheet the
chief reasons which led you to come
to Palo Alto?" t
I have before me replies to the
questions given above from 109 per
sons. These may serve as the basis
of three tables of numbers and per
centages. In the first table is con
sidered only the leading reason
which determined in each case the
choice of Stanford University. In
the second table the secondary rea
sons are also included, many per
sons naming from two to five subor
ordinate reasons which assisted in
the determination. In the third
table both classes of reasons are
considered together. As the num
ber of replies tabula led is about 100,
these figures stand virtually as per
centages.

In order not to be sent to

No question was asked as to what
other college would have been
chosen. In different answers these

are mentioned in the following
order as to frequency: Cornell,
Harvard. Wellesley, Chicago, Mich
igan, Indiana, Vale, Harvard, Col
orado, Princeton.
Characteristic' answers are the
following:
"Stanford is the place for young
men."
"Stanford seemed to offer the best
opportunities fora poor young man
who had long wished to enter col
lege."
"Expense, including transporta
tion (from New York), was esti
mated at less than four years at
Cornell."
"To kill two birds with one stone
—California and college."
"1 knew that if I ever went
through college I would have to pay
my own way, and the chances for
doing so here seemed better than
elsewhere. For the three years I
have been here I have succeeded
fairly well in doing so."
"There is something attractive in
the very name of California to an
Easterner. When 1 read of Stan
ford University, with its large en
dowment and promising future and
with its beautiful surroundings, I
thought, 'What a splendid location
fora great university!' And upon
further consideration I decided to
spend a few years at Stanford Uni
versity. The difference in the
climate of California in comparison
with that of the East also forms an
important consideration to an East
erner in determining to go to the
Pacific Coast. These are the main
considerations that led me to come
to Palo Alto."
''The chief reasons for coming to
Stanford University were that it
seemed to be a school of the highest
grade, located in a climate where a
person of weak health could pursue
a course of study while recuperat
ing."
"I take pleasure in adding that I
have found here all that I expected
to find and very much more; and I
gather from what 1 hear said by
Eastern students that the accounts
sent home by them all go to
strengthen the favorable opinion of
the University entertained already
by Eastern people."
"1 came to Stanford for three
reasons: (1) Because Stanford
was a 'new thing,' and 1 wanted to
give her a trial. (2) Because Stan
ford offered excellent courses along
the line of study 1 wished to pursue
(physiology). (3) Because some
of my friends tried to dissuade me
from going to Stanford because she
was, as they said, a 'Godless insti
tution.' I thought I would like to
go to Stanford and bring my God
with me, and perhaps establish him
there."
"A desire to start out on my own
resources in a new country. The
opportunities favorable to self sup
port. The elective system. The
assurance that the faculty were am
bitious and would keep ahead of
the times. Hence, with the wealth
to support it, the University would
always be great."
"I wanted a liberal university
education. I was disgusted with
fossil teachers in a school run by
politics. I wanted to see and know
Western life. I wanted to be a
stranger in a strange land. Stan
ford tilled the bill. 1 came."
