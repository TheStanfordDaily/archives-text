Thk sentiment of ihe University
will certainly not countenance the
action of certain members of the
Freshman Class this afternoon in
using the methods resorted to for
the purpose of preventing class ac
tion upon the question of rushing.
If there ure members of the Class of
191)0 who do lint wish to see this
custom banished from the institu
tion, upon whose fair name it
brings criticism from the outside
world, they should at le;ist be will
ing to make an open stand for its
cmi i una nee and tell their fallows
openly why t hey oppose its termina
tion. As ;i matter of fact, there is
no justification for rushing among
those who are advanced to th"
point of taking advantsige of the
opportunities Stanford has to offer.
If there ;ire any in our midst who
insist on pepetuating this custom
in spite of public opinion, the sen
timent of the students as ;i whole
is such that they will be glad to see
the faculty depart for once from its
policy of non-interference, and will
iipplaiul any action that body may
take to suppnss this "feature" bor
rowed by ns from our sister institu
tion across the bay, which is the
only other university where the
practise is tolerated in this form.
