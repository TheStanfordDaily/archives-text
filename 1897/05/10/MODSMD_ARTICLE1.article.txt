## Saturday's Contest in Encina Gymnasium Results in a Draw. 
### 
The basket-ball game between the
Stanford and Oakland High School
teams Saturday in Encina gymna
sium, resulted in a draw, the full
time being played before any score
was made. This was due to the ex
cellent interfering on both sides.
The Stanford team was by far the
stronger but the Oakland girls ex
celled them in alertness. The for
mer team played under difficulties
because of being indoors on a smooth
floor, having done all its practis
ing out on the Held by the R< • bit
gymnasium. The Oakland girls, on
the other hand, had done their
practising inside their gymnasium
The Stanford girls made the best
throws and their halls came nearer
the goal oftener than those of the
other team. The young ladies in

coaching the respective teams in
which they were interested and their
bright and lively yells rang out
through the entire game and added
to the general excitement.
