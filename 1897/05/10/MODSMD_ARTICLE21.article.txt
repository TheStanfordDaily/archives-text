A warning to bicyclists would
seem to lie in place from the. un
toward number of accidents that
have occurred recently. Reckless
riding at high speed is dangerous
enough at broad daylight, but there
is absolutely no excuse for sprinting
in the dark, much less without
lamps or bells as has been the
custom of late. Several very seri
ous accidents have recently been
caused by negligence in these
matters. Rider* should care
enough about their own safety to
exercise due precaution when there
is the least possibility of accident.
