# Saturday Night's Concert.

The Choral Society concert which
was given in Encina gymnasium
Saturday evening was very success
ful. The chorus composed of two
hundred and fifty voices was ex
ceptionally good. Though some
parts of the selections from"The
Messiah" were lacking in anima
tion, the rendition of "The Prayer
for Rain and its Answer" from
Mendelssohn's "Elijah" was given
with vigor arid expression and was
perhaps the best rendered of any of
the oratorio selections. "The Lin
den Tree" was sung with much ex
pression and the effect was very
pleasing. Mr. Landsberger, the
violinist, contributed very greatly

to the program by his excellent
playing. Beethoven's "Moonlight
Sonata," played hy Mr. Bendix
was thoroughly enjoyed by all.
Mrs. Basfort'., who has charmed
Stanford audiences before, was no
less charming in her selection from
"Cavalleria llusticana" and was
heartily applauded. Mrs. Wratten
also lias a pleasant voice and ren
dered several numbers. The other
numbers were all well taken.
