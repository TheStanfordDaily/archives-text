Throughout the long, uncertain,
and trying sickness Miss Bell
showed the same quiet self-control
and unselfish fortitude which were
characteristic of her at all times
As a student she was earnest,
thoughtful, and persevering. Uni
versity work was interrupted last
year by ill health, but 'die returned
to her work in the fall with new
zest and determination. Known
here at the University only to a
few friends she was by them al
ways respected and admired be
cause of her simple, noble char
acter and her sincere, womanly life.
To the family so bereaved we can
only extend the silent sympathy of
those who appreciate, though in
adequately, the loss that is theirs.
