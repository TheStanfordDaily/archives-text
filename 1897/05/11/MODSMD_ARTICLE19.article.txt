Since there has been a very gen
eral demand for information rela
tive to the manner in which the
Stanford representation in Cap anil
down was secured, it may lie in
place to make a statement of the
matter in order to correct the mis
understanding which has arisen
The slurs of a hue number of the
Sequoia on those who had charge
of Stanford's part in the work were
bastd on no knowledge of the facts
of the case, and were unjust as well
as untrue. Had the editor desired
to make his review a correct one, his
criticism would have been devoted
to the book itself and not to those
who performed the work.
It may be said that the Stanford
editors sent to the Eastern repre
sentative a large collection of the
best verse that has ever been written
at Stanford, representing the work
of all the writers who have attained
prominence in the University. If
the Eastern editor used poor judg
ment in making the selections for
the volume, as the Sequoia asserts,
that matter rests entirely with him,
and not with those who did the
work here.
