# A 						Missionary Enterprise.
## 
### 
During the present year an enter
prise has been undertaken at Stan
ford for the lirst time, although for
vears carried on in many Eastern
institutions of like standing. It is
the support of a christian mission
ary in the foreign missionary field.
In as much as nearly two hundred
students iire interested in this move
ment, and about live hundred dol
lars is to go out this year from the
university, it has been thought
proper to publish something of a
statement of the work which is thus
being carried on.
Mr. George Sherwood Eddy,
whose work receives the support
from Stanford students, having
graduated in '5)2, is a Yale man. He
is a man of wonderful power and
purity of character, and very well
known among college students
throughout the country by his con
nection with the student volunteer
movement. Convinced that his life
work lay in India, and having
thoroughly prepared himself for it,
he went out last October to begin it.
He himself is supported by his own
means, his work receiving all the
support which is sent out.
Mr. Eddy's work is almost exclu
sively among India's college men,
a most strategic point for mission
ary work, considering the power
which t liese men are to have over the
civilization of India during the next
half century, going out to lead the
people for or against Christianity.
Three letters have been received
from Mr. Eddy since his departure,
containing a definite account of his

own work, as well us vivid pictures
of the suffering which surrounds
liini in famine-stricken India.
During the past six months he
has been largely engaged in holding
great student conferences in the
various centers of student life in
India.
