# Hoshor Wins His Case.
## 
### 
The case of Hoshor,'9o, vs. the
Kautz Estate has just been decided
in the Washington Court. The case
arose on an agreement made soon
after a competitive examination for
naval cadets t > Annapolis held at
Tacoma. Hoshor, '90, having the
highest percentage declined in favor
of Kautz, ex-'95, and Gen. A. V.
Kautz agreed to pay Hoshor's
expenses at Stanford for four years.
The defense argued that the con
tract was void as against public pol
icy, and that there was no considera
tion except the illegal consideration
of bartering public offices. The
court held that it was not void as
against public policy as it was
proven that Hoshor was at the time
above the legal age for cadets at An
napolis and could not have been
appointed. But the court held the
contract good and gave judgment
for the plaintiff on the ground that
there was sufficient legal considera
tion on the part of the plaintiff, i. e.,
his agreeing to attend college and
his performing his agreement; and
the court complimented the young
man on having performed it so well
as to have graduated in three years.
