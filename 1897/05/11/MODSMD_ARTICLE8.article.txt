The coming year will probably
see several new instructors. Messrs
Arnold and Blichfeldt, both of the
Mathematics department, go to Eu
rope, and Professor Stearns of the
Physics department will in all
probability go to Germany. The
appointment of instructors is a
departmental affair and the new in
si ructors have not yet been reported
to Dr. Jordan for ratification.
Should Prof. Stearns go to Germany
his place will be taken by P. G.
Nutting '97. One of the places in
the Mathematics department will
doubtless go to Freeman '98. The
appointments of W. A. Snow, '97,
as an assistant in Hygiene, and of
11. C. Thompson '96, in French are
announced.
