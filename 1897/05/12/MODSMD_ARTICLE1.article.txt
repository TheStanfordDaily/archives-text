The work of the committee was
divided into three parts. The first
was to ascertain the condition of
history work in the High Schools of
California. For thin purpose, cir
cular letters were sent out. Over
lifty answers' were received, and the
results will probably be published
in the School Review Secondly, a
plan was devised for introducing the
study of local history into the
schools of the different counties. The
third duty of the committee is to
arrange, if possible, a course of gen

time a society will be organized to
take the place of the committee for
which the work of the committee
this year has been preparatory.
