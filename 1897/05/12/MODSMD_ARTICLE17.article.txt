Volume X. of the Daily Palo
Alto is completed with this issue.
If in the judgment of its readers, it
is considered a success and is ac
counted worthy of a place alongside
of the volumes which have preceded
it, we shall feel that our semester's
work has not been without its re
ward. It is necessary to express
our grateful appreciation of much
aid received from members of the
student body and faculty, and to
the members of the staff, whose
work has been at all times most
faithfully done.
