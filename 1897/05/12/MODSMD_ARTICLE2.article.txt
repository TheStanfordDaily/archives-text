						Word From the Next Editor.

### 
Students and professors who are
absent from the University next
year will please bear in mind the
fact that the Daily Palo Alto tie
sires to keep the University com
munity informed regarding their
whereabouts and doings. An at
tempt will be made next semester
to cover the Held of alumni news
very carefully and to supply to a
certain extent the place which we
hope may some day he taken by a
publication devoted entirely to the
interests of the Stanford alumni.
Another strenuous effort will be
put forth to issue the paper earlier
in the day. Aside from these slight
attempts at improvement, we shall
rest content if we succeed in keep
ing the paper up to the high stand
ard of excellence established by our
predecessors and especially in main
taining its present conservative
policy. Chas. E. Schwartz.
