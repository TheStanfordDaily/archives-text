To the .shareholders of the Co-opera
tive Association:
At the last meeting, held May 10,
there was an insufficient number of
shares represented to consider dis
incorporation. No further attempt
will be made to dissolve, but in
stead, the certificates of shares will
be reclaimed and' canceled. The
redeeming price, which will be the
amount left after settling all liabil
ities divided by the number of
shares, will be fixed as soon as a
few accounts of "on sale" goods are
rendered. A notice will be posted
on the quad bulletin board about
the middle of next week stating
this price. The remaining assets

will be deposited with the directors
of the Stanford Book Store, who
have consented to act gratuitously
aw agents in distributing the money
and canceling the shares.
