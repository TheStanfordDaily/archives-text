To a committee of students, ap
pointed l>y all "those who have
taken French in the University, to
draw up a testimonial of apprecia
tion of the work of Professor Brun,
the following has been presented:
' On tlfe evening of February 2G
1 was surprised to receive a call
from your comni'ttee who presented
me with your communication and
informed me that it had been laid
before President Jordan. Your re
presentatives expressed their high
appreciation of my work, assured
me of your continued regard and
esteem, as well as regret that my
association with the student body
was to end. This voluntary action
on the part of my students in my
behalf, involving much labor and
quite unexpected to me, calls for
my grateful acknowledgment.
I wish to say also that during
my six years of arduous work at
Stanford, while 829 students have
registered in my classes 1 have met
with uniform kindness and courtesy
from them and an earnestness in
the class room that has been an in
spiration to me. Nothing could
therefore be more gratifying to me
than this testimonial of youn es
teem. Believe me, ever grate ully
yours. Samuel J. Brun.
