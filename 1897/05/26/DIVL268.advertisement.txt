The Tavern of Castle Crag
The Tavern of Castle Crag was built in the heart of the Sierras, almost
at the foot of Mount Shasta, and amid the most picturesque mountain
scenery accessible to the tourist. The eligibility of the place selected was
due to a rare combination of flowing water, inspiring mountain scenery,
and inviting forests.
The Tavern of Castle Crag, with its splendid environment, it was be
lieved would appeal chiefly to those who seek a summer resort for health,
recreation, outdoor sports, sympathy with nature, and informal sociability.
To emphasize this intention and signify the kind of invitation extended,
the name TAVERN of Castle Crag was chosen.
To avoid all implication of sumptuous accommodations or the tyranny
of social formalism, and to realize this original conception, the management
has decided to make the Tavern of Castle Crag distinctively a family resort;
and especially attractive to those to whom health, recreation, and sympathy
with nature are paramount considerations. To this end rooms on the first
and second floors of this splendid tavern with board will he furnished at a
montly rate of $65 a person, and rooms on the third floor with board at a
monthly rate of $•")() a person.
The accommodations of the Tavern are first-class in every particular.
Its parlors and halls are elegant and spacious. Its verandas are cool and
inviting, placing the guest always in the presence of the most attractive
mountain scenery to be enjoyed from the balcony of any tavern in the world.
The opportunity for outdoor sports embraces hunting, fishing, riding,
bicycling, walking 011 mountain paths, and driving on picturesque roads.
The Tavern is located immediately 011 the main trunk line of the Califor
nia & Oregon Railroad, and is fourteen hours' ride from San Francisco,
twelve hours from Stockton, ten hours from Saramento, thirty hours from
Los Angeles, and twenty-three hours from Portland. The Tavern of Cas
tle Crag is reached from San Francisco and Sacramento without loss of time.
The train leaves San Francisco at 8 o'clock p.m., arriving early the follow
ing morning for breakfast, which is always ready upon the arrival of the
train. Returning, the train time affords equal accommodation. Thus
both in going and in coming the comfort of the passenger and the economy
of his time have been studied. In brief, the Tavern of Castle Crag realizes
to its guests the perfect ideal of that spring-time in the high altitudes of
the Sierras which never becomes high summer, ami is the comfortable
home of pleasing recreation and restful repose.
