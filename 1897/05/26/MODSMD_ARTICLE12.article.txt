Streamers of red and white hacked
by evetgreen transformed the gym
nasium into ;i bower of beauty for
the Commencement Ball which was
given Monday night. The bare
walls of the gymnasium were com
pletely hidden and the ceiling and
railings were visible only as a
means of supporting the abundant
decoration. Over tifty couples were
on the floor when the dance wa? he
gun at eight o'clock. The music
was by Schmetz's orchestra of San
Francisco and was all that could be
desired. The dances numbered
twenty with four extras. It was by
all odds the prettiest and most suc
cessful hop that has been held this
year, and was the crowning feature
of the closing week.
