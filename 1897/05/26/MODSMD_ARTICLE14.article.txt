# Planting of the Ivy.
## 
### 
ln accordance with old custom,
'97 planted an ivy beside the walls
of All Saints' Chapel in Palo Alto
Sunday afternoon. I)r. Jordan de
livered an address to the class,
speaking of his study with Agassiz
at Penikese, and of the consecration
that seemed to come from the work
of Agassiz. He related an incident
which occurred at the beginning of

this work, when Agassiz told his
students that they were there on a
sacred work that they might learn
how to come in contact with nature
and to read nature hy studying
nature herself; that they might go
out from there as missionaries to
teach people how to get to God that
way—through his manifestations
in nature's work. This should be
the purpose of all education—the
thought of devotion in action.
After the ivy had been planted,
the song written by Burton Murray
Palmer was sung, which concluded
the exercise.
