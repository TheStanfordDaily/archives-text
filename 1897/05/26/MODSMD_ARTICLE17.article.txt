# HOLDING UP THE WORLD,
## Address by A. W. Smith. 
### 
We have all seen pictures of Atlas
holding up the world, his great mus
cles swelling with the mighty ef
fort, his face stern with the con
sciousness of a great task. Had
Atlas been a cheerful as well as a
strong god, he could have held the
world in his hand and had time
for smiling. For whoso lifts cheer
fully at any burden finds it light.
Atlas was long ago relieved of his
task. Not the gods but men and
women hold up the world now.
When I was in college I knew a man
of fine ability, of studious habits
and good digestion, whose face was
like a thunder-cloud. I wished to
know why he took the world so
hard, and I found that he was think
ing of the great unanswered ques
tions of life: of the whence, the why,
and the whither. He thought so
constantly and so morbidly of these
things that he had 110 time left for
smiling or loving his neighbor. The
weight of the world was tenfold
multiplied for him, and all was 011
his back. 1 have not seen this man
for nearly twenty years; 1 have even
forgotten his name; but the memory
of liis face comes to me sometimes
even now like a blot on my spirit,
and no doubt he is still dimming
God's sunshine somewhere with his
cloudy face.
1 knew another man at the same
time. He earned his way working
at carpentering; he took his meals
at the "Struggle" club, and some
times he could not afford three in
one day; he was outstripped in a
contest fora position onan intercol
legiate athletic team; in many other
ways fate served him ill; but meet
ing him was always like coming
out into the sunshine. If any for
lorn fellow was sick and poor and
friendless, this man was his nurse
and friend, and hanker too if need
were. He also thought of life's
great unanswered questions; yet the
world was light, and he had time
for smiling and for loving his neigh
bor.
The years you have spent here
have been years of work and play;
of happiness and of hardship too,
perhaps; but they have been years
of growth —growth in knowledge
and strength. You have stored
potential energy, we hope, in body,
in brain, and in heart If this
energy is to be transformed into
power, power to do the world's work,
you must be cheerful men and wo
men. For all you have gained
without cheerfulness, which after
all it but a form of love, is but as
''sounding brass or a tinkling cym
bal."
Now cheerfulness, like other ele
ments of character, is a matter of
habit; is susceptible of cultivation;
we are born with different capacity
for it. One cheerful-born may by
steady cultivation of morbid thought
become a dead weight upon the
world; while a. pessimistic heredity
may he changed so that its possessor
may become a very pillar of the
world. Therefore I ask you con
sciously to cultivate this quality, so
that wherever your faces may come,
there shall be sunshine to sweeten
the world, and to help on efforts at
its upholding.
You are now to go out to do your
part among men and women. If
you have at all caught the spirit
of this place; if anything of the
calm courage and unfailing cheer
of Dr. Jordan has entered into your
hearts, you will go with an abi
ding faith that the heart of
the Universe is sound and
true and sweet, knowing that
no failure can come, 110 evil what
ever can befall to one who works

and smiles and loves his neighbor.
So you will find the world light and
will leave it better for your living.
Trusting that it may be so with
you, I bid you good-bye and God
speed.
