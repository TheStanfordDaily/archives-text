# Promenade Concert
## 
### 
Tuesday's exercises closed with
the Promenade Concert in the
quadrangle in the evening from 8
to 11. It was a brilliant event.
The quad was everywhere decorated
with Japanese lanterns, down the
corridors, along the eaves, and under
the arches. Schmetz's Park Band
played during the evening from the
stand in the center. Booths in the
arcades had been assigned the
young ladies' sororities and to Ro
ble and to the King's Daughters,,
and these were fitted up for the
reception of guests.
This has become a classic event
in the University; it is the distinc
tive feature of Stanford Commence
ments. It is the Seniors' time to
say farewell to the quad before the
final exercises of Commencement
morning. So it meant much to
those who came to the quad that
night, and when the last strains of
the music had died away and the
lanterns one by one flickered and
went out, the Seniors knew that it
was all over, that the four years of
college life were at an end.
