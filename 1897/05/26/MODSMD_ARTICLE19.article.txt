# FACULTY TEAM DEFEATED.
## Baseball Game Won By The Seniors. 
### 
The Seniors won the annua 1 game
with the Faculty l>v the elastic
score of 23 to 7. A large and deco
rative crowd saw the Faculty hite
the dust, and gazed with sorrowful
mood at the monument that marks
the remains of the Faculty nine—a
yellow bat all shattered and broken.
The features of the game were Dr.
Jordan, the Celestial Seniors, and
the Faculty yell, which ran:
"Cigars, cigars,
Cigarettes and beer,
Faculty, Faculty,
We're right here."
The Seniors arrived on the dia
mond at 10:30. The Faculty team
had been on the field for hours
They were anxious for the im
broglio. The Hush of expected vic
tory stained their cheeks. Hadn't
they practised for weeks? Great
pangs of exultation surged through
Captain Angell's circulation, and
he smiled approvingly as the Fac
ulty rooters made uncompliment
ary statements about the Seniors.
Promptly at 10:45 the Faculty
went to the bat and played like
Chinamen. Jn their half of the
first the Seniors piled up three
runs, and Dr. Angell's temperature
went up several points. The Fac
ulty were playing an unprincipled
game. They didn't seem to know.
In the first of the second the peda
gogues "crossed the home baste
thrice,'' as one of them put it. But
this performance was immediately
marred by "thrice" outs, and Cap
tain Angell's dead face was again
seen in the box. Then it was that
the Seniors began to beat a path
around the diamond and the Fac
ulty rooters disappeared. The cli
max of misfortune was artistically
capped when Dr. Jordan broke "the
yellow bat." The President had
rapped out several beautiful hits.
He was the only one who had been
hitting the ball, and thinking that
he must save the game by one bold
stroke, he waved the yellow pole
with a force that nothing could re
sist, and the weapon was shattered.
This is the third time that the
Faculty team has gone down before
the Seniors, and that three times
in succession, while they have won
but two games, those of 'i) 3 and' 94.
