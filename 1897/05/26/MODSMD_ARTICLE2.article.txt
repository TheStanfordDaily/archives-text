# THE 						PASSING OF PLATO
## Commencement Address by Professor Jenkins. 
### 
The stupendous changes that
have been wrought in the material
life of the civilized races in a short
period of time by the progress of
modern science have been generally
recognized. We have to make only a
casual investigation into the history
of the production of the things that
would come under our view at our
first turn, to find complete revolu
tion in production, manufacture,
and distribution. We find further
that it is not in each a single change,
but revolution on revolution the
most radical. For example, in le*s
than twenty-live years the immense
and complicated bus.ness of transit
in our cities has passed from omni
bus to horse car, from horse car to the
cable system, from the cable system
to the electric car system, with
special variations in the way of ele
vated railroads and pneumatic rail
ways. Methods of lighting, heat
ing, production and transference of
power for motors, have passed
through equal strides of change and
improvement. Everything con
nected with the immense business
of t transportation, from the great un
dertaking of bridge building and
steamship structures down to the
sealing of a freight car or the exca
vation of a yard of rock, has in a
like period passed through radical
revolutions that are bewildering in
their rapidity and in the greatness
of the interests involved.
This change and this advance
have appeared not alone in these
large and conspicuous phenomena
of activity, but in the countless
other lines of human industry
change has followed change. Im
provement and advance on what
lias been just past have been the
constant movement of the time.
On account of the complex relations
that exist in a community, a single
new invention may greatly affect
many occupations other than the
one in which the invention is used.
Consequently as matters are now
going, it is beyond mental grasp to
comprehend the breadth and depth
of these changes. As the result of
them hosts of old occupations have
been destroyed, innumerable ones
have been completely and radically
revolutionized, and hosts of new ones
have been created. This has made
a wholesale destruction of old rela
tions and a wholesale creation of
new ones. And with all this have
come and still must come the most
severe strains on the structure of the
community in the readjustment of
these relations.
This condition of the present time
appears more striking when we con
sider that more and greater changes
have occurred in the material life
of thecommunity and the adjust
ments these have brought with
them in the last ten years than have
occurred in any thousand years pre
vious to the ninteenth century.
It is agreed on all hands that all
these marvels of change and im
provement in the setting of our ma
terial life have been the result of
the application of the scientific
method to t he study of nature. Kven
those who suspect science and decry
the scientific method and warn the
elect against both, acknowledge the
service that science has done for

what tliey style the material man.
They, as promptly as others, de
mand of the hotels, railroads, ar
chitects, and publishing houses that
they take advantage in every way
of the latest that science has to
offer. We have no longer, then,
to contend for what science has ac
complished for this side of human
life.
These marvels are of profound
interest and with an outcome im
possible to foresee; but interesting
and significant as these results of
science are, it is still another phase
of the effect of the modern scien
tific method that shall detain us at
ibis moment. Too large it is and
too comprehensive —too far-reach
ing to be brought to more than
mere notice in so short a time. It
is the effect of science on the
thought of the time, and more spe
cifically its effect on higher educa
tion and the university.
The expression, ''The thought of
the time," as generally made use
of, is not accurately descriptive.
Strictly speaking, the thought of
any time has its manifold expres-

sion in Jill thiit, the people of the
time do or produce, whether it he
in the form of manufacture, works
of art, customs, institutions, or the
varied forms of written expression
that have come from them. Hut
the expression is more usually lim
ited to those more formal products
of mental activity represented hy
its literature, systems of philoso
phy, and formal sciences.
The enumeration of the triumphs
of science frequently includes only
the list of remarkable appliances
for bettering our material life. Hut
the scientific method has also be
gun to affect most profoundly the
other side of human life. It
is revolutionizing the methods of
thought in all phases of mental ac-
The progress here has been more
slow, uncertain, and unsuccessful.
Men are more ready to change the
appliances of a new home, the
methods of travel and communica
tion, and even their methods of
thinking in business relations and
active life, than the}' are to change

in all those matters not immediately
connected with material life in which
there is a fierce and definite compe
tition. But a brief examination
will show the profound influence of
this method.
Turning back to the most pros
perous age of Greece, we find the
Greeks sympathetic lovers of na
ture, as their life and art have
shown. They were students, too,
of nature, groping not wholly
blindly, as demonstrated by many
of their conceptions that have
passed down to us. There arose
among them Socrates and Plato —
the teacher, and his literary exec
utor and expounder. With the
purest and best of motives they un
consciously did the race a disser
vice that became a bar to progress
for the ages that followed. They
sought fundamental truths with the
commendable purpose of settlingall
questions of ethics for all time.
If the universe is the product of
fundamental principles, the long
ages of succession of events, with
their differentiation, synthesis, and
evolution, have complicated matters

immensely and buried fundamental
principles so deep that it is impossi
ble to discover them, in the external
universe. Consequently, not quickly
finding their required principles
and definitions in this external uni
verse of nature, and without un
derstanding why the universe could
not furnish them, they turned their
inquiries within. And the mind is
so constituted that it can make any
hypotheses and then proceed to
build a system logically based on
them. Hence they had no trouble
to obtain the definitions required.
These were of ihe mind alone.
Then to defend and hold these it
was necessary to do away with the
rest of the universe. So from that
time on, mind was the universe;
mind and matter had nothing in
common. Nature was to be over
looked, despised, and shunned as
gross, corrupting matter, and only
flights of mind were real and worth
any serious consideration.
This whole legitimate outcome
did not immediately follow on the
innocent diversions of Plato. It

whs not until after Aristotle—whose
genius won him a place of go large
authority—had taken up these
phases of thinking and put them
in form to he used that they came
to exert so extensive and powerful
an influence. Aristotle was him
self in a way a student of nature of
great promise. But to his large
line of successors, hardly followers,
the mental flights were more at
tractive than his bugs and fishes.
So the world went into the occupa
tion of what has been stvled "pure
thinking"; that is, thinking not con
ditioned by the presence of any fact
of the gross universe.
Then arose one after another the
so-called great thinkers, men who
solved all things by introspection
and contemplation. Then the sys
tems of philosophy spread over
Western Europe like cobwebs over
a lawn of a summer morning. The
early writers of the Christian
Church, tlie Christian fathers, also
wove a tissue of theology by the
methods and with the inspiration
of Plato. And thus the warp and
woof of the intellectual life of ages
consist of what has been styled
the "lazy philosophy of Plato."
The church, the state, and the
schools, literature and art, were
dominated by the methods which
seek fundamental principles by in
trospection and on them build each
its peculiar structure, by the con
ception that the mind of man was
the center and content of the uni
verse, and all else was either gross
or unreal. Investigation and col
lection of facts were not only un
necessary, but they all belonged to
that netherworld which could only
serve the purpose of interfering
with the lofty movement of pure
thought.
Through all this long period of
pure thinking no contribution of
value to progress can be pointed out.
At long intervals protests appeared
against the extreme conditions
brought on by these methods.
These protests culminated in the
Renaissance and the Reformation.
These movements were the express
ion of the true instinctive love of
man for nature and the real. They
brought new life again into the
world, but their leaders could never
shake themselves clear of the very
methods whose results they opposed.
It was with them the instinct to
return to the true position without
the training to maintain it. Con
sequently their movements, re
freshing as showers after a long
drought, produced no far-reaching
radical changes and but slow and
diversified progress. They were
rather a rush to the enjoyment
of nature once more, and not a
serious study of her, while the
methods of thinking were little
changed.
Thus matters stood until the be
ginning of the present century; and
with this immense past and the
slavish reverence for the past these
conceptions and methods, like the
"Old Man of the Sea," still hang
upon the neck of the present move
ment. Hut as this lusty giant grows,
the "Old Man's" days are num
bered.
All through the darkest of this
unproductive period, real students
of nature, scattered here and there,
more or less stifled by the attno

sphere of the times, kept alive,
smouldering and almost extin
guished as it often was, coals of the
true lire which was to blaze out in
such a conflagration as we are now
witnessing, from which is to come a
new and more glorious world.
Before the beginning of the pres
ent century the number of students
of nature was steadily increasing.
The feeling was growing, and indeed
was sometimes expressed by them,
that no thinking or conclusion is
warranted except that based on
facts —facts became of extreme
importance; and no end of labor
and pains was spent to obtain
them. They again and again re
paid all this labor by yielding the
most wonderful discoveries, famil
iar to all acquainted with the his
tory of science.
Thus slowly and surely grew into
tangible shape what we know as the
scientific method —a method which
has been described by Huxley as the
"method of common sense," a
method which simply demands an
accurate knowledge of the facts be
fore describing their relations.
Its value plainly demonstrated
and once clearly conceived, it has
become the plain and simple instru
ment that has made these magnifi
cent conquests in the world of our
material life; and now we have the
spectacle of its vigorous effect on
the matters and methods of those
things usually designated as of the
mind.
We have but to pass in rapid re
view the state of the knowledge of
today and that of recent years to
obtain our evidence.
All of the old nature subjects,
physical and biological, have been
completely revolutionized. Within
them whole groups of elaborate sci
ences have been created, and all of
these have progressed with remark
able rapidity. All those subjects not
classed with the nature subjects
have also felt the influence of the
creative power of the scientific
method, for within the bounds of the
humanities this breath of life is
transforming everything and bring
ing into birth the healthy begin
nings of many sciences.
The immeasurable success at
tained in a short period of years in
the study of nature by the scientific
method, contrasted with the abso
lute lack of progress which was the
result of othef methods, forced it
self on the attention of those really
seeking truth in other lines of
thought. As a consequence students
of history, of social institutions and
problems, of language, of mental
phenomena, and even of ethics and
philosophy, to a greater or less ex
tent have introduced the scientific
method into their work.
A comparison of the state of each
of these lines of human thought of
today with that of fifty years ago
shows astonishing changes.
To illustrate: As we have exem
plified so well among us here, his
tory is no loner merely the more or
less interesting accounts of the con
spicuous persons and events of a
nation's life, based on facts not ac
curately obtained, colored bv the
prejudices or literary ambition of
those describing them; often, it is
true, it is unified into a semblance
of completeness by constructing the
whole on a plan—a plan, however,
which is the result of an attempt to
illustrate principles which have
been preconceived by the author.
Indeed the history of the past is
chiefly the works of authors.
The history of the present is quite
a different matter. The history of
the past is to the historical science
of the present what the interesting
stories of dogs, elephants, and curi

ous plants are to that complex of
sciences which has for its object the
explanation of the laws by which all
living beings have come in their
manifold forms to be occupying
their diverse positions and main
taining their overwhelming and
complex relations with one another
and all the world beside.
In like manner, history at the
present time is a vigorous science.
It proposes to solve a thousand
problems of the development of the
life of the human race. Its ma
terial is of that broad extent that it
includes every fact and every act of
all peoples of all times. It views
the earth covered with diversified
peoples of different languages, cus
toms, institutions, occupations, and
beliefs. It sees these as innumer
able differentiations of original com
mon antecedents. It proposes to
ascertain as far as possible the facts
of the progress of this differentia
tion and development, and from
these facts discover the laws that
have wrought so many diverse
forms of community life, so many
forms of thought and activity.
The problems are vast. The ma
terial of the past too scant by far, it
is true, still the scientific method of
research is multiplying the mater
ial immensely. And the great re
spect that the scientific spirit has
engendered has driven the present
to begin to make most extensive re
cords of its acts, so that the future
historian will not lack for data.
His labors will even be greater and
more slow, but they will give real
products.
Not all students and workers in
history have fully caught the scien
tific spirit nor have comprehended
the vastness and grandeur of the
work that the method of science
has demonstrated possible for them.
History is still to them the source of
themes for the production of litera
ture, instead of being a magnificent
structure to whose building they
will contribute. Thus the lines be
tween history and biology are dis
appearing, and history lias become
thoroughly a natural science with
the most complex of all problems,
demanding the most rigid methods.
The scientific spirit has not changed
the writer of history alone but lias
also affected his audience. We are
no longer satisfied with the aul lior's
emotions in respect to Caesar's cros
sing the Rubicon, or Washington's
crossing the Deleware. We wish
from liini a certified picture of the
scene and an accurate determina
tion of its place in the movement
of which it is a pari; and we will
furnish our own emotions.
The social sciences have been also
greatly affected by the example of
these scientific methods, although
they are still largely in the hands
of the theorists. There are arising
among its students those who have
a deej) and earnest desire to come
face to face with the real facts of so
cial life and their relations and laws
of development. They are recogniz
ing that these problems are of the
most difficult and complex nature
and above all require accu
rate quantitative determination.
Theories in regard to products and
their distribution in regard to busi
ness and legislation, do hot with
them precede the knowledge of the
real facts of these great occupations.
They will show how such facts as
the invention of a process of
making steel has affected transpor
tation, distribution, and business
and other relations more than have
works on the principles of political
economy. May their tribe increase!
In the region of the study of lan
guage the scientific method has
given us within the space of a com

paratively few years the great and
important science of philology,
with its many departments —the
first successful attempt at a rational
view of language in all the long
period of language study. The im
petus thus given to active and vig
orous research in a domain of knowl
edge that had become dead and
profitless in the extreme, is in itself
sufficient proof of the value of this
method. Time does not permit the
account of how one after another
the other fields of intellectual activ
ity have come or are corning to feel
the tonic influence of science. It
would be interesting to know what
is to become of philosophy. But as
indications point, the forecast would
bean ungrateful task. Two or three
tlr.ngs must happen. She must
give up that solemn bluff that the
philosopher knows more of each
science than any of the specialists
in the sciences know. She must
give up her function of being the
science of all sciences. The philoso
pher who would attempt to corre
late all the sciences of today might
as well singly and alone attempt to
digest all the agricultural products
of America in a single year.
Science, its method and its pro
ducts having furnished the envir
onment of our life, having opened
up to us vast fields of knowledge
and thus having permeated every
form of literature, and having
demonstrated the only successful
method thus far hit upon for ascer
taining truth, and thus having com
pelled change in the general
methods of thought —in short, hav
ing created a new heaven and a
new earth —it was but a natural
demand that it should forma part
of the educational system, which
might reasonably be supposed to
prepare for living in this new uni
verse.
At least in England and America
nothing has been more conservative
than t he system of education. The
schools for higher education in
hardly any manner reflected the
vital knowledge and the actual dis
cussions of the times in which they
existed. Their aitnsasfar as they can
be ascertained were such that they
had no need to deal with any form
of real and useful knowledge. It
was claimed that they were to give
training and culture. The training
was mainly of a few specific forms
of memory and feats of mental
legerdemain, but the culture was
undeniable unmistakable, very
unctuous, and glowed with a soft
light. Its possessor was known as
a scholar.
The subjects used for this train
ing had become traditional and
were for the most part conven
tional. These studies were in no
way in touch with the active world
outside. The occupations and meth
ods of thought were precisely of
that nature to make members of
this community despise all mate
rial facts and shun all contact
with material objects.
This isolated and narrow life cre
ated a community peculiar to itself
and jealous of its peculiarities.
They created for themselves an ex
clusive caste, the members worship
ing one another and despising all
the world beside, and in turn
mildly despised by the world when
it happened to think of them.
All this did not seem so out of
place in England, where still the
land is dotted with Mediaeval
ruins, and people are still employed
to keep fresh the blood-stains of
many who were beheaded by a Me
diaeval faith. But in America,
where poverty forbade the main
taining the full livery of all this,
the incongruity was very striking.

The more intense intellectual
life grown up outside of the uni
versities created a wider demand
fora preparation to live it. Nat
urally the universities were sought
to gratify this demand. But this
old regime did not satisfy those
who looked forward to a career not
within the lines of theology and
philosophy. Some inkling at least
of those great conquests in the
realms of nature were begged for in
the short intervals in Latin prose
in grinding out Latin verses. Thus
science came in first as a sort of in
dulgence. She occupied the nooks
and corners. She appeared only
in the mild form of lectures on the
most conspicuous and interesting
phenomena of nature. It was not
imagined (hat it did or could con
tribute to the training and culture
which it was the peculiar func
tion of the university to give.
Hut these beginnings were the com
mencement of and awakening of a
new university life. It was the
opening of a cleft in the walls, al
lowing a beam of the light of day
unclouded by smoke of incense, not
distorted by stained glass, to pene
trate into the great structure.
The mere statement of the con
quests that had been made over
nature carried with it the evi
dence of the great progress of the
world outside and beyond the uni
versity. It showed that already
knowledge and life had become so
vast and so intense that the old
routine could not serve for it.
With a few of the meager facts of
science first introduced came next
into the university the methods of
science. Then appeared the lal(or
atories as a means of education.
This made the connection between
the university and the rest of the
world. In the laboratories real
and tangible facts and the inquir
ing mind were in the university
brought face to face, and the true
method of the solution of the one
by the other demonstrated. This
touch of reality brought about a
series of results in higher education
which are revolutionizingand must
continue to revolutionize our con
ceptions of its aim and content.
The real universe is vastly greater
and more magnificent than any
imagined one. The innermost re
cess of our nature vibrates to real
contact with the actual universe.
It is a partand product of it. It grew
by the means of the external uni
verse, and is still to grow by that
means.
Those in the University who felt
the tonic of a breath of a real at
mosphere soon demanded reality in
other knowledge than that of na
ture. The student after seeing and
trying the careful method of the
scientist who patiently and with
great labor and with every guard
against prejudice gathered a great
number of facts, and looked to
these and these alone for his con
clusions, and when these con
clusions thus produced seemed
somewhat real, could no longer
with patience listen to an historical
discourse which was the work of
imagination, an announcement of
the most profound and far-reaching
conclusions in economic science
which had their source only in
principles assumed in the begin
ning by the author, or a course in
the science of the mind which did
not deal with ascertained real facts
of the mind; and least of all could
he listen with patience to the ex
pounding of a system of philosophy
which assumed to comprehend all
sciences and correlate them with
out a knowledge of a single one of
them.
The student from the laboratory
who has felt its meaning and
caught its spirit knows that all
these things are thin air thrown
into vibrations, and that the same
air might as well have vibrated in
any other combination. Conse
quently he demands the same sort
of knowledge and the same cer
tainty in it in other lines of study.
He who has felt the keen pleasure
and satisfaction of a quantitative
determination of a piece of knowl
edge can not but look with some
thing of contempt on mere opinion
and effusive statement.
It is these demands that have
shaken up many oi the old subjects
and the old methods. Another ex
tremely important effect has been
the introduction and strengthening
of other lines of study not gener
ally classed as scientific which
were practically outside the system
of education; that is, the group
known as the humanities, subjects
which are often wrongly assumed
as opposed to the sciences.
While the teaching of Plato that
separated mind from matter still
influences largely the thought of
our time, yet the time is fast ap
proaching when all lines of sep
aration will disappear, and man in
all his phases will be considered
and treated as a part of nature.
There is now every day wider ex
tension of the demand of real
knowledge in regard to all things
pertaining to man. This is the di
rect result of this taste for reality
that the scientific spirit has begot
ten. In consequence there are now
in the universities side by side with
the sciences the great studies his
tory, economics, literature, and art.
These with the sciences were almost
unknown in the higher schools in
their true sense fifty years ago in
this country and in England.
Science has also discovered, dig
nified, and given a deeper meaning
to still other phases of human ac
tivity. The mechanical and in
dustrial arts have felt in the most
wonderful manner its creative in
fluence, and to this they owe the
positions they are coming to take
among the results of productive
thinking. The prejudice bred by
the long use of a narrow definition
of culture kept these subjects out of
the educational courses, hut it is
beginning to be realized that it
may be as much worth while to
understand the making of the com
plex and finished products of the
present age as it is to contemplate
the rude implements of a past one.
Today still, in the courses in the
elementary and secondary schools,
the most conservative and Plato
ridden institutions that remain to
us, there is given a meager place to
the knowledge of man and of na
ture; that is, the sciences, history,
literature, and art. But the time
is at hand when that self-sufficient
philosophy which so largely domi
nates the thought in our lower
schools must succumb to the move
ments of the times. Then the
children and youth, through the
very periods of growth and develop
ment, when they can best catch the
spirit and form the habits of the
advanced age in which they live,
instead of being systematically
hedged in from all contact with it,
will be intelligently induced into
its spirit, made familiar with
its product and drilled in its
methods. When they leave the
schools they will be immediately at
home in the world about them, and
can successfully face it.
Theologians, Hegelians, and Pla
tonists of whatever twist have
cause to fear the scientific method;
but least of all should the student
of the humanities make faces at

the scientist, and become emo
tional, not to say hysterical, at the
scientific method, as was recently
the case with an earnest student
history. There is, of course, an op
portunity sometimes for ilie his
torian to be moved with the spirit
of the antiquarian, and as becomes
upon some of the admirable fig
ures that have crossed the stage in
the past, to bemoan the times that
no longer produce in exact detail
these tine old characters.
The dignified scholar, the fine
old gentleman glowing with the
culture of the old school, awakens
our enthusiastic admiration, and
even love, as we unearth him from
the times in which he lived; still
we need not mourn that no one
now who is strong enough to be
come such a one is willing to do
so, any more than he would desire
to wear a queue, three-cornered
hat and shoe buckles and hunt
ducks with a blunderbuss. Then
we may console ourselves with the
recollection of the many other things
which of necessity were contem
poraneous with this fine old gen
tleman, and happily have passed
awav with him.
How inane in any ease are these
wails against science and the
scientific method and the changes
they are working out. The scien
tific method is so constructed that
it can overturn nothing but error,
and if one's investments do not lie
in that direction why worry any
longer about it?
The plea that science unfits one
for the enjoyment of that side of
nature and life which it is the
office of art and literature to ex
press is an equally shallow one.
How can knowing the truth more
deeply, cause us to see less of beauty,
or to have less of feeling in all
that appeals to us?
While we may be wrapt in ad
miration at the grandeur of a mount
ain, and watch with awe the effect
of changing tint and color of
mountain, skv, and darkening val
ley, as the painting of a setting
sun carries them all through a
most wonderful program, our emo
tions will be none the less or ex
pansion of soul le>s great if we
also see that mountain a monu
ment erected as the resultant of
great forces that have through ages
been at work on its structure and
form. Science does not prevent
our seeing the beauty of the scene,
but lends vastly to Ihe effect by
making it, instead of a momentary
display of color with no more mean
ing than we can conjure up, a veri
table height from which we get a
glimpse of the real living universe
greater than any imagined one. So
with every bird, flower, or gem, and
every phenomenon of nature.
Science does not do away with
beauty of form or color or grace of
motion, but gives to all these a
deeper meaning. It may be true
that scientists do not usually rave
about these things, and do not par
ticularly enjoy the ravings of
others. They have passed the rav
ing period, and have reached that
of deep self-sacrificing devotion.
All such talk as abusing Newton
for the "analysis of the rainbow,"
or shuddering because "science
teaches the youth to analyze his
mother's tears," and the like, are
either hysterical or sensational.
The same quantitative study and
rigid application of the method of
science must give ;i deeper meaning
to the facts within the realm of the
study of man; nor can it lessen
feeling in regard to him. It will
surely often change .»ur point of
view and change our conceptions of
the value of things. The scientific

method is not going to deprive us
<>112 the power of crying, but will
clear up things so that we can cry
over the right things—in other
words, cry more intelligently.
The scientific method has been
correctly described as the method
of "common sense." And to say
as was recently said in a promi
nent address, "'beware of the scien
tific method" in studies of history,
is to decry the extension of com
mon sense into these regions.
The new evils of which we are
hearing so much as the result of
science arise rather from those who
have taken up the name and some
what of the language of science,
and not its real method and spirit.
In all times there have been those
who, seeking to gain somewhat
of prominence and authority for
what they have to say or do, have
posed as members of a strong or
popular party. Science has become
popular and much respected, con
sequently there have come to at
tempt to enroll with her votaries
great motley crowds of those who
write and speak, who catch up
some of her language, take on
something of her air, and with
them promulgate as her teachings
all the various vagaries that the
human mind is heir to. There re
sults in this time of change and
lack of scientific education much
confusion and distrust of science.
Th s is increased l»y still another
group of quite a different stamp.
They are honest and earnest and in
their work wish to use, indeed
think tliey are using, the scientific
method; but unfortunately for all
concerned they have no true con
ception of it, nor have they ever
rationally attempted to gain such a
conception. These people would not
think of attempting to calculate an
eclipse or build a steam-engine
without the years of preparation
for such work, but do not hesitate
to attempt far more difficult prob
lems which only the scientific
method 'will solve, without any
preparation for the work.
But evils and confusion arising
from these causes will right them
selves in time, for the tests are so
(dear that those who know how to
employ them may with reason
able certainty distinguish the'
true method from its imitation,
and the number of such good
judges is rapidly increasing.
The warning then should be
not to heware of the scientific
method, but to beware of attempt
ing to proceed in any direction
without its being most rigorously
applied. And while it is true that
the scientific method applied to the
study of chemistry and physics
"'has not made history a whit easier
to understai d," the application of
the scientific method to history has
already begun to unravel some of
its problems, and it seems sure
nothing else will accomplish this.
While it is too much to expect
that the habits of thought that
have dominated for two centuries
will pass promptly and without
many sorrows, yet tliey are passing
as the unprofitable must pass.
The scientific method does not
promise panaceas, hut it insures a
healthy life by showing that they
do not exist. As we see things
now the scientific method can do
all that can be done, and that
seems to be the conclusion of the
whole matter.
While viewing with great pleas
ure the service that science has
done higher education, we can not
escape the fact that the scientific
spirit has suffered somewhat by its
contact with the university. When
science was conquering the world,

it was living its heroic age. Its
followers were true heroes. Devo
tion, love, self-sacrifice, and courage,
without hope of any reward from
the world outside, constituted their
life. Their motives were of the
purest and loftiest. With the suc
cess of science there have come
other conditions, and now there
are also other motives for the pur
suit of science. In the universities
the science subjects have been com
pelled more or less to conform to
the routine already existing in
them. The subjects in the uni
versities form parts of formal
courses, which are <>112 more or less
artificial groups. These lead to de
grees and other distinctions. Thus
motives are created for the study
of science which are entirely for
eign to the spirit and content of
any science. Indeed the rivalry of
schools has become such that many
forms of bait have been resorted to
in order to lure people on to fur
ther study in the university courses,
such as prizes, degrees, scholar
ships, fellowships, and distinctions
of various kinds. Thus there come
to be mingled together with those
who study science for its own sake
many who pursue it for some ul
terior motive. This has brought
out a host of unscrupulous little in
tellects who in the various de
partments of science are boring in
every conceivable direction and are
describing with the most tiresome
details their minutest chips, and
often with it wasting good money
in expensive lithographs. Their
products are becoming so numerous
and intermingled with real works
that it requires great labor to sift
them out. But this is not the
greatest harm. The most serious
evil is the robbing the true spirit
of science of the power it posessess
when it alone is the motive.
What will be the final outcome?
Will science, which has already
done so much to make rational
the university courses, which has
pierced so many bubbles and cor
roded so many baubles, be able
finally to make all conventional
trivialities of the university disap
pear? Already a large number of
those who enter the universities do
so for the preparation for work they
have in mind. To such the arti
ficial stimuli count for nothing.
May we not hope for the time when
it will be seen that the university
does a great harm in proposing
either directly or indirectly any
other motive than those its sub
jects carry with them? Should the
university encourage in its students
such an absurd class of questions
as "How much chemistry or his
tory shall I take to get one degree,
and how much add to this to get
another?"
And then when one has increased
in knowledge or grown in spirit
why should he wish a certificate t >
that effect or receive a distinguish
ing mark? Most curious of all is
the millinery method of desig
nating stages of intellectual de
velopment. For example, a cer
tain development of soul, shown by
a hood with a yellow border; cap
carrying a rectangular figure on
top probably indicates the mind
having reached two dimensions;
a certain refinement of spirit, indi
cated by sleeves of gown neatly
edged with gold braid; certain very
lofty aspirations realized, collar
turned up, gown long, cut bias and
gored with black darts of velvet; a
combination of ail those grand
motherly qualities that allows one
to preside over this gentle throne,
and thus be a true alma mater,
gown very full with plenty of
white lace. Now it is thought vul
gar for one to display his material
wealth, or for an Indian to boast
of heinga big one. Can one with
any greater propriety assume a halo
because he has learned a certain
group of things?
The systems of education which
we have, both elementary and
higher, are in great part an in
heritance from times long preced
ing our own. Whether they were
suited to those times and what were
the reasons for their forms is of
little consequence to us now as far
as the organization of a system for
our own times is concerned. Hut
as a matter of fact it is made of
great consequence from the un
reasoning fear and distaste to
changing what has once been in
such matters. We have here too
much reverence for the past, sim
ply from the halo that the past
often gives things, incongruous as
they may have been when they
existed. Indeed the fact thai any
system belonged to the past, should
in itself lead us to suspect it, as it
was adapted to times that, from the
nature of things, could not be like
our own. From their hallowed as
sociations, to attempt to use the
wooden plough that the Romans
used, to plough the great ranches of
California would not only be an
example of maudlin sentimentality,
but would reduce California to the
condition in which it was when it
was formerly under control of a
Latin civilization. The wooden
plough and its contemporary ideas
may properly find a place in the
museum of a university, butshould
not form any part of its working
organization.
Nor should the conception that
the educational system is the result
of an evolution be made the ex
cuse for retaining useless parts
that have come to us from the past
as sort of rudimentary organs to
remind us of its origin. The laws
of organic growth and heredity do
not hold here. Hut as the builder
of a steamship is free to ignore all
the steps in the evolution of the
parts of a modern vessel, and
choose the best material and latest
devices that mechanical engineering
has to offer, so in our educational
system there is nothing in its na
ture to prevent our making it what
we please.
When we come to consider the
vastness of well-ordered real knowl-i
edge at the present time, the in-1
tensity of intellectual activity, the
great number of important prob
lems thrust upon us, the crowds of
errors as well as the multitudes of
truths that crowd upon our judg-i
ment, and the tierce competition on
every hand, requiring the best
equipment in modern knowledge
and method, there is the most ur
gent reason that our educational
system be cleared of everything
that interferes with its cleanest ac
tion.
The elementary system needs no
longer the endless patching up of
its motley mixture, the strange re
sult of necessity, empiricism, and
accident. It has had enough of
the fanciful apologies of the phi
losophers for its existence, and of
mystic pictures of its fancied rela
tions to an imagined soul. It
needs to be completely reorganized
from the foundation and put in
relation to the life of today.
As for our higher schools, the
universities, they have become
freer to react to the times. They
are every year becoming less under
the influence of the inane and in
active scholasticism which made

the most narrow of definitions of
culture and set her up as a goddess
and established about her a puerile
ritual and a most bigoted hierarchy.
First in Germany and then in
America the university broke away,
or is breaking away from these
bonils.
The university is no longer to be
simply the conservator of the past.
It should be the leader and stimu
lus of the present and the prophet
of the future. Every phase of in
tellectual activity should have its
place in the university, where will
he gathered its literature, where
may be collected its facts, and
where will be grouped masters in
its science who stand ready to im
part its spirit and drill in its
methods. Throughout the whole
will prevail thoroughly the scien
tific spirit and method, and that
complete freedom in choice of sub
jects and career absolutely neces
sary to strongest development.
Our own university in America
most nearly approaches in spirit
such nn ideal, and if such a life
here is not universal it is at least,
possible to all, and many there be
who live with enthusiasm up to this
possibility. 1 congratulate you
that during your eduoational career
you have had the possibility of
breathing with freedom something
of the spirit of the times. May
you that go and you that remain
vividly appreciate this too rare a
privilege, and cultivate and guard
most jealously this spirit. May it
become an instinct with us. May
we be quick to resent and ever ar
dent to oppose any taint of the old
regime which may seek admission
among us, and thus threaten our
freedom and undermine our intel
lectual manhood.
The stupendous changes that
have been wrought in the material
life of the civilized races in a short
period of time by the progress of
modern science have been generally
recognized. We have to make only a
casual investigation into the history
of the production of the things that
would come under our view at our
first turn, to find complete revolu
tion in production, manufacture,
and distribution. We find further
that it is not in each a single change,
but revolution on revolution the
most radical. For example, in le*s
than twenty-live years the immense
and complicated bus.ness of transit
in our cities has passed from omni
bus to horse car, from horse car to the
cable system, from the cable system
to the electric car system, with
special variations in the way of ele
vated railroads and pneumatic rail
ways. Methods of lighting, heat
ing, production and transference of
power for motors, have passed
through equal strides of change and
improvement. Everything con
nected with the immense business
of t transportation, from the great un
dertaking of bridge building and
steamship structures down to the
sealing of a freight car or the exca
vation of a yard of rock, has in a
like period passed through radical
revolutions that are bewildering in
their rapidity and in the greatness
of the interests involved.
This change and this advance
have appeared not alone in these
large and conspicuous phenomena
of activity, but in the countless
other lines of human industry
change has followed change. Im
provement and advance on what
lias been just past have been the
constant movement of the time.
On account of the complex relations
that exist in a community, a single
new invention may greatly affect
many occupations other than the
one in which the invention is used.
Consequently as matters are now
going, it is beyond mental grasp to
comprehend the breadth and depth
of these changes. As the result of
them hosts of old occupations have
been destroyed, innumerable ones
have been completely and radically
revolutionized, and hosts of new ones
have been created. This has made
a wholesale destruction of old rela
tions and a wholesale creation of
new ones. And with all this have
come and still must come the most
severe strains on the structure of the
community in the readjustment of
these relations.
This condition of the present time
appears more striking when we con
sider that more and greater changes
have occurred in the material life
of thecommunity and the adjust
ments these have brought with
them in the last ten years than have
occurred in any thousand years pre
vious to the ninteenth century.
It is agreed on all hands that all
these marvels of change and im
provement in the setting of our ma
terial life have been the result of
the application of the scientific
method to t he study of nature. Kven
those who suspect science and decry
the scientific method and warn the
elect against both, acknowledge the
service that science has done for

what tliey style the material man.
They, as promptly as others, de
mand of the hotels, railroads, ar
chitects, and publishing houses that
they take advantage in every way
of the latest that science has to
offer. We have no longer, then,
to contend for what science has ac
complished for this side of human
life.
These marvels are of profound
interest and with an outcome im
possible to foresee; but interesting
and significant as these results of
science are, it is still another phase
of the effect of the modern scien
tific method that shall detain us at
ibis moment. Too large it is and
too comprehensive —too far-reach
ing to be brought to more than
mere notice in so short a time. It
is the effect of science on the
thought of the time, and more spe
cifically its effect on higher educa
tion and the university.
The expression, ''The thought of
the time," as generally made use
of, is not accurately descriptive.
Strictly speaking, the thought of
any time has its manifold expres-

sion in Jill thiit, the people of the
time do or produce, whether it he
in the form of manufacture, works
of art, customs, institutions, or the
varied forms of written expression
that have come from them. Hut
the expression is more usually lim
ited to those more formal products
of mental activity represented hy
its literature, systems of philoso
phy, and formal sciences.
The enumeration of the triumphs
of science frequently includes only
the list of remarkable appliances
for bettering our material life. Hut
the scientific method has also be
gun to affect most profoundly the
other side of human life. It
is revolutionizing the methods of
thought in all phases of mental ac-
The progress here has been more
slow, uncertain, and unsuccessful.
Men are more ready to change the
appliances of a new home, the
methods of travel and communica
tion, and even their methods of
thinking in business relations and
active life, than the}' are to change

in all those matters not immediately
connected with material life in which
there is a fierce and definite compe
tition. But a brief examination
will show the profound influence of
this method.
Turning back to the most pros
perous age of Greece, we find the
Greeks sympathetic lovers of na
ture, as their life and art have
shown. They were students, too,
of nature, groping not wholly
blindly, as demonstrated by many
of their conceptions that have
passed down to us. There arose
among them Socrates and Plato —
the teacher, and his literary exec
utor and expounder. With the
purest and best of motives they un
consciously did the race a disser
vice that became a bar to progress
for the ages that followed. They
sought fundamental truths with the
commendable purpose of settlingall
questions of ethics for all time.
If the universe is the product of
fundamental principles, the long
ages of succession of events, with
their differentiation, synthesis, and
evolution, have complicated matters

immensely and buried fundamental
principles so deep that it is impossi
ble to discover them, in the external
universe. Consequently, not quickly
finding their required principles
and definitions in this external uni
verse of nature, and without un
derstanding why the universe could
not furnish them, they turned their
inquiries within. And the mind is
so constituted that it can make any
hypotheses and then proceed to
build a system logically based on
them. Hence they had no trouble
to obtain the definitions required.
These were of ihe mind alone.
Then to defend and hold these it
was necessary to do away with the
rest of the universe. So from that
time on, mind was the universe;
mind and matter had nothing in
common. Nature was to be over
looked, despised, and shunned as
gross, corrupting matter, and only
flights of mind were real and worth
any serious consideration.
This whole legitimate outcome
did not immediately follow on the
innocent diversions of Plato. It

whs not until after Aristotle—whose
genius won him a place of go large
authority—had taken up these
phases of thinking and put them
in form to he used that they came
to exert so extensive and powerful
an influence. Aristotle was him
self in a way a student of nature of
great promise. But to his large
line of successors, hardly followers,
the mental flights were more at
tractive than his bugs and fishes.
So the world went into the occupa
tion of what has been stvled "pure
thinking"; that is, thinking not con
ditioned by the presence of any fact
of the gross universe.
Then arose one after another the
so-called great thinkers, men who
solved all things by introspection
and contemplation. Then the sys
tems of philosophy spread over
Western Europe like cobwebs over
a lawn of a summer morning. The
early writers of the Christian
Church, tlie Christian fathers, also
wove a tissue of theology by the
methods and with the inspiration
of Plato. And thus the warp and
woof of the intellectual life of ages
consist of what has been styled
the "lazy philosophy of Plato."
The church, the state, and the
schools, literature and art, were
dominated by the methods which
seek fundamental principles by in
trospection and on them build each
its peculiar structure, by the con
ception that the mind of man was
the center and content of the uni
verse, and all else was either gross
or unreal. Investigation and col
lection of facts were not only un
necessary, but they all belonged to
that netherworld which could only
serve the purpose of interfering
with the lofty movement of pure
thought.
Through all this long period of
pure thinking no contribution of
value to progress can be pointed out.
At long intervals protests appeared
against the extreme conditions
brought on by these methods.
These protests culminated in the
Renaissance and the Reformation.
These movements were the express
ion of the true instinctive love of
man for nature and the real. They
brought new life again into the
world, but their leaders could never
shake themselves clear of the very
methods whose results they opposed.
It was with them the instinct to
return to the true position without
the training to maintain it. Con
sequently their movements, re
freshing as showers after a long
drought, produced no far-reaching
radical changes and but slow and
diversified progress. They were
rather a rush to the enjoyment
of nature once more, and not a
serious study of her, while the
methods of thinking were little
changed.
Thus matters stood until the be
ginning of the present century; and
with this immense past and the
slavish reverence for the past these
conceptions and methods, like the
"Old Man of the Sea," still hang
upon the neck of the present move
ment. Hut as this lusty giant grows,
the "Old Man's" days are num
bered.
All through the darkest of this
unproductive period, real students
of nature, scattered here and there,
more or less stifled by the attno

sphere of the times, kept alive,
smouldering and almost extin
guished as it often was, coals of the
true lire which was to blaze out in
such a conflagration as we are now
witnessing, from which is to come a
new and more glorious world.
Before the beginning of the pres
ent century the number of students
of nature was steadily increasing.
The feeling was growing, and indeed
was sometimes expressed by them,
that no thinking or conclusion is
warranted except that based on
facts —facts became of extreme
importance; and no end of labor
and pains was spent to obtain
them. They again and again re
paid all this labor by yielding the
most wonderful discoveries, famil
iar to all acquainted with the his
tory of science.
Thus slowly and surely grew into
tangible shape what we know as the
scientific method —a method which
has been described by Huxley as the
"method of common sense," a
method which simply demands an
accurate knowledge of the facts be
fore describing their relations.
Its value plainly demonstrated
and once clearly conceived, it has
become the plain and simple instru
ment that has made these magnifi
cent conquests in the world of our
material life; and now we have the
spectacle of its vigorous effect on
the matters and methods of those
things usually designated as of the
mind.
We have but to pass in rapid re
view the state of the knowledge of
today and that of recent years to
obtain our evidence.
All of the old nature subjects,
physical and biological, have been
completely revolutionized. Within
them whole groups of elaborate sci
ences have been created, and all of
these have progressed with remark
able rapidity. All those subjects not
classed with the nature subjects
have also felt the influence of the
creative power of the scientific
method, for within the bounds of the
humanities this breath of life is
transforming everything and bring
ing into birth the healthy begin
nings of many sciences.
The immeasurable success at
tained in a short period of years in
the study of nature by the scientific
method, contrasted with the abso
lute lack of progress which was the
result of othef methods, forced it
self on the attention of those really
seeking truth in other lines of
thought. As a consequence students
of history, of social institutions and
problems, of language, of mental
phenomena, and even of ethics and
philosophy, to a greater or less ex
tent have introduced the scientific
method into their work.
A comparison of the state of each
of these lines of human thought of
today with that of fifty years ago
shows astonishing changes.
To illustrate: As we have exem
plified so well among us here, his
tory is no loner merely the more or
less interesting accounts of the con
spicuous persons and events of a
nation's life, based on facts not ac
curately obtained, colored bv the
prejudices or literary ambition of
those describing them; often, it is
true, it is unified into a semblance
of completeness by constructing the
whole on a plan—a plan, however,
which is the result of an attempt to
illustrate principles which have
been preconceived by the author.
Indeed the history of the past is
chiefly the works of authors.
The history of the present is quite
a different matter. The history of
the past is to the historical science
of the present what the interesting
stories of dogs, elephants, and curi

ous plants are to that complex of
sciences which has for its object the
explanation of the laws by which all
living beings have come in their
manifold forms to be occupying
their diverse positions and main
taining their overwhelming and
complex relations with one another
and all the world beside.
In like manner, history at the
present time is a vigorous science.
It proposes to solve a thousand
problems of the development of the
life of the human race. Its ma
terial is of that broad extent that it
includes every fact and every act of
all peoples of all times. It views
the earth covered with diversified
peoples of different languages, cus
toms, institutions, occupations, and
beliefs. It sees these as innumer
able differentiations of original com
mon antecedents. It proposes to
ascertain as far as possible the facts
of the progress of this differentia
tion and development, and from
these facts discover the laws that
have wrought so many diverse
forms of community life, so many
forms of thought and activity.
The problems are vast. The ma
terial of the past too scant by far, it
is true, still the scientific method of
research is multiplying the mater
ial immensely. And the great re
spect that the scientific spirit has
engendered has driven the present
to begin to make most extensive re
cords of its acts, so that the future
historian will not lack for data.
His labors will even be greater and
more slow, but they will give real
products.
Not all students and workers in
history have fully caught the scien
tific spirit nor have comprehended
the vastness and grandeur of the
work that the method of science
has demonstrated possible for them.
History is still to them the source of
themes for the production of litera
ture, instead of being a magnificent
structure to whose building they
will contribute. Thus the lines be
tween history and biology are dis
appearing, and history lias become
thoroughly a natural science with
the most complex of all problems,
demanding the most rigid methods.
The scientific spirit has not changed
the writer of history alone but lias
also affected his audience. We are
no longer satisfied with the aul lior's
emotions in respect to Caesar's cros
sing the Rubicon, or Washington's
crossing the Deleware. We wish
from liini a certified picture of the
scene and an accurate determina
tion of its place in the movement
of which it is a pari; and we will
furnish our own emotions.
The social sciences have been also
greatly affected by the example of
these scientific methods, although
they are still largely in the hands
of the theorists. There are arising
among its students those who have
a deej) and earnest desire to come
face to face with the real facts of so
cial life and their relations and laws
of development. They are recogniz
ing that these problems are of the
most difficult and complex nature
and above all require accu
rate quantitative determination.
Theories in regard to products and
their distribution in regard to busi
ness and legislation, do hot with
them precede the knowledge of the
real facts of these great occupations.
They will show how such facts as
the invention of a process of
making steel has affected transpor
tation, distribution, and business
and other relations more than have
works on the principles of political
economy. May their tribe increase!
In the region of the study of lan
guage the scientific method has
given us within the space of a com

paratively few years the great and
important science of philology,
with its many departments —the
first successful attempt at a rational
view of language in all the long
period of language study. The im
petus thus given to active and vig
orous research in a domain of knowl
edge that had become dead and
profitless in the extreme, is in itself
sufficient proof of the value of this
method. Time does not permit the
account of how one after another
the other fields of intellectual activ
ity have come or are corning to feel
the tonic influence of science. It
would be interesting to know what
is to become of philosophy. But as
indications point, the forecast would
bean ungrateful task. Two or three
tlr.ngs must happen. She must
give up that solemn bluff that the
philosopher knows more of each
science than any of the specialists
in the sciences know. She must
give up her function of being the
science of all sciences. The philoso
pher who would attempt to corre
late all the sciences of today might
as well singly and alone attempt to
digest all the agricultural products
of America in a single year.
Science, its method and its pro
ducts having furnished the envir
onment of our life, having opened
up to us vast fields of knowledge
and thus having permeated every
form of literature, and having
demonstrated the only successful
method thus far hit upon for ascer
taining truth, and thus having com
pelled change in the general
methods of thought —in short, hav
ing created a new heaven and a
new earth —it was but a natural
demand that it should forma part
of the educational system, which
might reasonably be supposed to
prepare for living in this new uni
verse.
At least in England and America
nothing has been more conservative
than t he system of education. The
schools for higher education in
hardly any manner reflected the
vital knowledge and the actual dis
cussions of the times in which they
existed. Their aitnsasfar as they can
be ascertained were such that they
had no need to deal with any form
of real and useful knowledge. It
was claimed that they were to give
training and culture. The training
was mainly of a few specific forms
of memory and feats of mental
legerdemain, but the culture was
undeniable unmistakable, very
unctuous, and glowed with a soft
light. Its possessor was known as
a scholar.
The subjects used for this train
ing had become traditional and
were for the most part conven
tional. These studies were in no
way in touch with the active world
outside. The occupations and meth
ods of thought were precisely of
that nature to make members of
this community despise all mate
rial facts and shun all contact
with material objects.
This isolated and narrow life cre
ated a community peculiar to itself
and jealous of its peculiarities.
They created for themselves an ex
clusive caste, the members worship
ing one another and despising all
the world beside, and in turn
mildly despised by the world when
it happened to think of them.
All this did not seem so out of
place in England, where still the
land is dotted with Mediaeval
ruins, and people are still employed
to keep fresh the blood-stains of
many who were beheaded by a Me
diaeval faith. But in America,
where poverty forbade the main
taining the full livery of all this,
the incongruity was very striking.

The more intense intellectual
life grown up outside of the uni
versities created a wider demand
fora preparation to live it. Nat
urally the universities were sought
to gratify this demand. But this
old regime did not satisfy those
who looked forward to a career not
within the lines of theology and
philosophy. Some inkling at least
of those great conquests in the
realms of nature were begged for in
the short intervals in Latin prose
in grinding out Latin verses. Thus
science came in first as a sort of in
dulgence. She occupied the nooks
and corners. She appeared only
in the mild form of lectures on the
most conspicuous and interesting
phenomena of nature. It was not
imagined (hat it did or could con
tribute to the training and culture
which it was the peculiar func
tion of the university to give.
Hut these beginnings were the com
mencement of and awakening of a
new university life. It was the
opening of a cleft in the walls, al
lowing a beam of the light of day
unclouded by smoke of incense, not
distorted by stained glass, to pene
trate into the great structure.
The mere statement of the con
quests that had been made over
nature carried with it the evi
dence of the great progress of the
world outside and beyond the uni
versity. It showed that already
knowledge and life had become so
vast and so intense that the old
routine could not serve for it.
With a few of the meager facts of
science first introduced came next
into the university the methods of
science. Then appeared the lal(or
atories as a means of education.
This made the connection between
the university and the rest of the
world. In the laboratories real
and tangible facts and the inquir
ing mind were in the university
brought face to face, and the true
method of the solution of the one
by the other demonstrated. This
touch of reality brought about a
series of results in higher education
which are revolutionizingand must
continue to revolutionize our con
ceptions of its aim and content.
The real universe is vastly greater
and more magnificent than any
imagined one. The innermost re
cess of our nature vibrates to real
contact with the actual universe.
It is a partand product of it. It grew
by the means of the external uni
verse, and is still to grow by that
means.
Those in the University who felt
the tonic of a breath of a real at
mosphere soon demanded reality in
other knowledge than that of na
ture. The student after seeing and
trying the careful method of the
scientist who patiently and with
great labor and with every guard
against prejudice gathered a great
number of facts, and looked to
these and these alone for his con
clusions, and when these con
clusions thus produced seemed
somewhat real, could no longer
with patience listen to an historical
discourse which was the work of
imagination, an announcement of
the most profound and far-reaching
conclusions in economic science
which had their source only in
principles assumed in the begin
ning by the author, or a course in
the science of the mind which did
not deal with ascertained real facts
of the mind; and least of all could
he listen with patience to the ex
pounding of a system of philosophy
which assumed to comprehend all
sciences and correlate them with
out a knowledge of a single one of
them.
The student from the laboratory
who has felt its meaning and
caught its spirit knows that all
these things are thin air thrown
into vibrations, and that the same
air might as well have vibrated in
any other combination. Conse
quently he demands the same sort
of knowledge and the same cer
tainty in it in other lines of study.
He who has felt the keen pleasure
and satisfaction of a quantitative
determination of a piece of knowl
edge can not but look with some
thing of contempt on mere opinion
and effusive statement.
It is these demands that have
shaken up many oi the old subjects
and the old methods. Another ex
tremely important effect has been
the introduction and strengthening
of other lines of study not gener
ally classed as scientific which
were practically outside the system
of education; that is, the group
known as the humanities, subjects
which are often wrongly assumed
as opposed to the sciences.
While the teaching of Plato that
separated mind from matter still
influences largely the thought of
our time, yet the time is fast ap
proaching when all lines of sep
aration will disappear, and man in
all his phases will be considered
and treated as a part of nature.
There is now every day wider ex
tension of the demand of real
knowledge in regard to all things
pertaining to man. This is the di
rect result of this taste for reality
that the scientific spirit has begot
ten. In consequence there are now
in the universities side by side with
the sciences the great studies his
tory, economics, literature, and art.
These with the sciences were almost
unknown in the higher schools in
their true sense fifty years ago in
this country and in England.
Science has also discovered, dig
nified, and given a deeper meaning
to still other phases of human ac
tivity. The mechanical and in
dustrial arts have felt in the most
wonderful manner its creative in
fluence, and to this they owe the
positions they are coming to take
among the results of productive
thinking. The prejudice bred by
the long use of a narrow definition
of culture kept these subjects out of
the educational courses, hut it is
beginning to be realized that it
may be as much worth while to
understand the making of the com
plex and finished products of the
present age as it is to contemplate
the rude implements of a past one.
Today still, in the courses in the
elementary and secondary schools,
the most conservative and Plato
ridden institutions that remain to
us, there is given a meager place to
the knowledge of man and of na
ture; that is, the sciences, history,
literature, and art. But the time
is at hand when that self-sufficient
philosophy which so largely domi
nates the thought in our lower
schools must succumb to the move
ments of the times. Then the
children and youth, through the
very periods of growth and develop
ment, when they can best catch the
spirit and form the habits of the
advanced age in which they live,
instead of being systematically
hedged in from all contact with it,
will be intelligently induced into
its spirit, made familiar with
its product and drilled in its
methods. When they leave the
schools they will be immediately at
home in the world about them, and
can successfully face it.
Theologians, Hegelians, and Pla
tonists of whatever twist have
cause to fear the scientific method;
but least of all should the student
of the humanities make faces at

the scientist, and become emo
tional, not to say hysterical, at the
scientific method, as was recently
the case with an earnest student
history. There is, of course, an op
portunity sometimes for ilie his
torian to be moved with the spirit
of the antiquarian, and as becomes
upon some of the admirable fig
ures that have crossed the stage in
the past, to bemoan the times that
no longer produce in exact detail
these tine old characters.
The dignified scholar, the fine
old gentleman glowing with the
culture of the old school, awakens
our enthusiastic admiration, and
even love, as we unearth him from
the times in which he lived; still
we need not mourn that no one
now who is strong enough to be
come such a one is willing to do
so, any more than he would desire
to wear a queue, three-cornered
hat and shoe buckles and hunt
ducks with a blunderbuss. Then
we may console ourselves with the
recollection of the many other things
which of necessity were contem
poraneous with this fine old gen
tleman, and happily have passed
awav with him.
How inane in any ease are these
wails against science and the
scientific method and the changes
they are working out. The scien
tific method is so constructed that
it can overturn nothing but error,
and if one's investments do not lie
in that direction why worry any
longer about it?
The plea that science unfits one
for the enjoyment of that side of
nature and life which it is the
office of art and literature to ex
press is an equally shallow one.
How can knowing the truth more
deeply, cause us to see less of beauty,
or to have less of feeling in all
that appeals to us?
While we may be wrapt in ad
miration at the grandeur of a mount
ain, and watch with awe the effect
of changing tint and color of
mountain, skv, and darkening val
ley, as the painting of a setting
sun carries them all through a
most wonderful program, our emo
tions will be none the less or ex
pansion of soul le>s great if we
also see that mountain a monu
ment erected as the resultant of
great forces that have through ages
been at work on its structure and
form. Science does not prevent
our seeing the beauty of the scene,
but lends vastly to Ihe effect by
making it, instead of a momentary
display of color with no more mean
ing than we can conjure up, a veri
table height from which we get a
glimpse of the real living universe
greater than any imagined one. So
with every bird, flower, or gem, and
every phenomenon of nature.
Science does not do away with
beauty of form or color or grace of
motion, but gives to all these a
deeper meaning. It may be true
that scientists do not usually rave
about these things, and do not par
ticularly enjoy the ravings of
others. They have passed the rav
ing period, and have reached that
of deep self-sacrificing devotion.
All such talk as abusing Newton
for the "analysis of the rainbow,"
or shuddering because "science
teaches the youth to analyze his
mother's tears," and the like, are
either hysterical or sensational.
The same quantitative study and
rigid application of the method of
science must give ;i deeper meaning
to the facts within the realm of the
study of man; nor can it lessen
feeling in regard to him. It will
surely often change .»ur point of
view and change our conceptions of
the value of things. The scientific

method is not going to deprive us
<>112 the power of crying, but will
clear up things so that we can cry
over the right things—in other
words, cry more intelligently.
The scientific method has been
correctly described as the method
of "common sense." And to say
as was recently said in a promi
nent address, "'beware of the scien
tific method" in studies of history,
is to decry the extension of com
mon sense into these regions.
The new evils of which we are
hearing so much as the result of
science arise rather from those who
have taken up the name and some
what of the language of science,
and not its real method and spirit.
In all times there have been those
who, seeking to gain somewhat
of prominence and authority for
what they have to say or do, have
posed as members of a strong or
popular party. Science has become
popular and much respected, con
sequently there have come to at
tempt to enroll with her votaries
great motley crowds of those who
write and speak, who catch up
some of her language, take on
something of her air, and with
them promulgate as her teachings
all the various vagaries that the
human mind is heir to. There re
sults in this time of change and
lack of scientific education much
confusion and distrust of science.
Th s is increased l»y still another
group of quite a different stamp.
They are honest and earnest and in
their work wish to use, indeed
think tliey are using, the scientific
method; but unfortunately for all
concerned they have no true con
ception of it, nor have they ever
rationally attempted to gain such a
conception. These people would not
think of attempting to calculate an
eclipse or build a steam-engine
without the years of preparation
for such work, but do not hesitate
to attempt far more difficult prob
lems which only the scientific
method 'will solve, without any
preparation for the work.
But evils and confusion arising
from these causes will right them
selves in time, for the tests are so
(dear that those who know how to
employ them may with reason
able certainty distinguish the'
true method from its imitation,
and the number of such good
judges is rapidly increasing.
The warning then should be
not to heware of the scientific
method, but to beware of attempt
ing to proceed in any direction
without its being most rigorously
applied. And while it is true that
the scientific method applied to the
study of chemistry and physics
"'has not made history a whit easier
to understai d," the application of
the scientific method to history has
already begun to unravel some of
its problems, and it seems sure
nothing else will accomplish this.
While it is too much to expect
that the habits of thought that
have dominated for two centuries
will pass promptly and without
many sorrows, yet tliey are passing
as the unprofitable must pass.
The scientific method does not
promise panaceas, hut it insures a
healthy life by showing that they
do not exist. As we see things
now the scientific method can do
all that can be done, and that
seems to be the conclusion of the
whole matter.
While viewing with great pleas
ure the service that science has
done higher education, we can not
escape the fact that the scientific
spirit has suffered somewhat by its
contact with the university. When
science was conquering the world,

it was living its heroic age. Its
followers were true heroes. Devo
tion, love, self-sacrifice, and courage,
without hope of any reward from
the world outside, constituted their
life. Their motives were of the
purest and loftiest. With the suc
cess of science there have come
other conditions, and now there
are also other motives for the pur
suit of science. In the universities
the science subjects have been com
pelled more or less to conform to
the routine already existing in
them. The subjects in the uni
versities form parts of formal
courses, which are <>112 more or less
artificial groups. These lead to de
grees and other distinctions. Thus
motives are created for the study
of science which are entirely for
eign to the spirit and content of
any science. Indeed the rivalry of
schools has become such that many
forms of bait have been resorted to
in order to lure people on to fur
ther study in the university courses,
such as prizes, degrees, scholar
ships, fellowships, and distinctions
of various kinds. Thus there come
to be mingled together with those
who study science for its own sake
many who pursue it for some ul
terior motive. This has brought
out a host of unscrupulous little in
tellects who in the various de
partments of science are boring in
every conceivable direction and are
describing with the most tiresome
details their minutest chips, and
often with it wasting good money
in expensive lithographs. Their
products are becoming so numerous
and intermingled with real works
that it requires great labor to sift
them out. But this is not the
greatest harm. The most serious
evil is the robbing the true spirit
of science of the power it posessess
when it alone is the motive.
What will be the final outcome?
Will science, which has already
done so much to make rational
the university courses, which has
pierced so many bubbles and cor
roded so many baubles, be able
finally to make all conventional
trivialities of the university disap
pear? Already a large number of
those who enter the universities do
so for the preparation for work they
have in mind. To such the arti
ficial stimuli count for nothing.
May we not hope for the time when
it will be seen that the university
does a great harm in proposing
either directly or indirectly any
other motive than those its sub
jects carry with them? Should the
university encourage in its students
such an absurd class of questions
as "How much chemistry or his
tory shall I take to get one degree,
and how much add to this to get
another?"
And then when one has increased
in knowledge or grown in spirit
why should he wish a certificate t >
that effect or receive a distinguish
ing mark? Most curious of all is
the millinery method of desig
nating stages of intellectual de
velopment. For example, a cer
tain development of soul, shown by
a hood with a yellow border; cap
carrying a rectangular figure on
top probably indicates the mind
having reached two dimensions;
a certain refinement of spirit, indi
cated by sleeves of gown neatly
edged with gold braid; certain very
lofty aspirations realized, collar
turned up, gown long, cut bias and
gored with black darts of velvet; a
combination of ail those grand
motherly qualities that allows one
to preside over this gentle throne,
and thus be a true alma mater,
gown very full with plenty of
white lace. Now it is thought vul
gar for one to display his material
wealth, or for an Indian to boast
of heinga big one. Can one with
any greater propriety assume a halo
because he has learned a certain
group of things?
The systems of education which
we have, both elementary and
higher, are in great part an in
heritance from times long preced
ing our own. Whether they were
suited to those times and what were
the reasons for their forms is of
little consequence to us now as far
as the organization of a system for
our own times is concerned. Hut
as a matter of fact it is made of
great consequence from the un
reasoning fear and distaste to
changing what has once been in
such matters. We have here too
much reverence for the past, sim
ply from the halo that the past
often gives things, incongruous as
they may have been when they
existed. Indeed the fact thai any
system belonged to the past, should
in itself lead us to suspect it, as it
was adapted to times that, from the
nature of things, could not be like
our own. From their hallowed as
sociations, to attempt to use the
wooden plough that the Romans
used, to plough the great ranches of
California would not only be an
example of maudlin sentimentality,
but would reduce California to the
condition in which it was when it
was formerly under control of a
Latin civilization. The wooden
plough and its contemporary ideas
may properly find a place in the
museum of a university, butshould
not form any part of its working
organization.
Nor should the conception that
the educational system is the result
of an evolution be made the ex
cuse for retaining useless parts
that have come to us from the past
as sort of rudimentary organs to
remind us of its origin. The laws
of organic growth and heredity do
not hold here. Hut as the builder
of a steamship is free to ignore all
the steps in the evolution of the
parts of a modern vessel, and
choose the best material and latest
devices that mechanical engineering
has to offer, so in our educational
system there is nothing in its na
ture to prevent our making it what
we please.
When we come to consider the
vastness of well-ordered real knowl-i
edge at the present time, the in-1
tensity of intellectual activity, the
great number of important prob
lems thrust upon us, the crowds of
errors as well as the multitudes of
truths that crowd upon our judg-i
ment, and the tierce competition on
every hand, requiring the best
equipment in modern knowledge
and method, there is the most ur
gent reason that our educational
system be cleared of everything
that interferes with its cleanest ac
tion.
The elementary system needs no
longer the endless patching up of
its motley mixture, the strange re
sult of necessity, empiricism, and
accident. It has had enough of
the fanciful apologies of the phi
losophers for its existence, and of
mystic pictures of its fancied rela
tions to an imagined soul. It
needs to be completely reorganized
from the foundation and put in
relation to the life of today.
As for our higher schools, the
universities, they have become
freer to react to the times. They
are every year becoming less under
the influence of the inane and in
active scholasticism which made

the most narrow of definitions of
culture and set her up as a goddess
and established about her a puerile
ritual and a most bigoted hierarchy.
First in Germany and then in
America the university broke away,
or is breaking away from these
bonils.
The university is no longer to be
simply the conservator of the past.
It should be the leader and stimu
lus of the present and the prophet
of the future. Every phase of in
tellectual activity should have its
place in the university, where will
he gathered its literature, where
may be collected its facts, and
where will be grouped masters in
its science who stand ready to im
part its spirit and drill in its
methods. Throughout the whole
will prevail thoroughly the scien
tific spirit and method, and that
complete freedom in choice of sub
jects and career absolutely neces
sary to strongest development.
Our own university in America
most nearly approaches in spirit
such nn ideal, and if such a life
here is not universal it is at least,
possible to all, and many there be
who live with enthusiasm up to this
possibility. 1 congratulate you
that during your eduoational career
you have had the possibility of
breathing with freedom something
of the spirit of the times. May
you that go and you that remain
vividly appreciate this too rare a
privilege, and cultivate and guard
most jealously this spirit. May it
become an instinct with us. May
we be quick to resent and ever ar
dent to oppose any taint of the old
regime which may seek admission
among us, and thus threaten our
freedom and undermine our intel
lectual manhood.
The stupendous changes that
have been wrought in the material
life of the civilized races in a short
period of time by the progress of
modern science have been generally
recognized. We have to make only a
casual investigation into the history
of the production of the things that
would come under our view at our
first turn, to find complete revolu
tion in production, manufacture,
and distribution. We find further
that it is not in each a single change,
but revolution on revolution the
most radical. For example, in le*s
than twenty-live years the immense
and complicated bus.ness of transit
in our cities has passed from omni
bus to horse car, from horse car to the
cable system, from the cable system
to the electric car system, with
special variations in the way of ele
vated railroads and pneumatic rail
ways. Methods of lighting, heat
ing, production and transference of
power for motors, have passed
through equal strides of change and
improvement. Everything con
nected with the immense business
of t transportation, from the great un
dertaking of bridge building and
steamship structures down to the
sealing of a freight car or the exca
vation of a yard of rock, has in a
like period passed through radical
revolutions that are bewildering in
their rapidity and in the greatness
of the interests involved.
This change and this advance
have appeared not alone in these
large and conspicuous phenomena
of activity, but in the countless
other lines of human industry
change has followed change. Im
provement and advance on what
lias been just past have been the
constant movement of the time.
On account of the complex relations
that exist in a community, a single
new invention may greatly affect
many occupations other than the
one in which the invention is used.
Consequently as matters are now
going, it is beyond mental grasp to
comprehend the breadth and depth
of these changes. As the result of
them hosts of old occupations have
been destroyed, innumerable ones
have been completely and radically
revolutionized, and hosts of new ones
have been created. This has made
a wholesale destruction of old rela
tions and a wholesale creation of
new ones. And with all this have
come and still must come the most
severe strains on the structure of the
community in the readjustment of
these relations.
This condition of the present time
appears more striking when we con
sider that more and greater changes
have occurred in the material life
of thecommunity and the adjust
ments these have brought with
them in the last ten years than have
occurred in any thousand years pre
vious to the ninteenth century.
It is agreed on all hands that all
these marvels of change and im
provement in the setting of our ma
terial life have been the result of
the application of the scientific
method to t he study of nature. Kven
those who suspect science and decry
the scientific method and warn the
elect against both, acknowledge the
service that science has done for

what tliey style the material man.
They, as promptly as others, de
mand of the hotels, railroads, ar
chitects, and publishing houses that
they take advantage in every way
of the latest that science has to
offer. We have no longer, then,
to contend for what science has ac
complished for this side of human
life.
These marvels are of profound
interest and with an outcome im
possible to foresee; but interesting
and significant as these results of
science are, it is still another phase
of the effect of the modern scien
tific method that shall detain us at
ibis moment. Too large it is and
too comprehensive —too far-reach
ing to be brought to more than
mere notice in so short a time. It
is the effect of science on the
thought of the time, and more spe
cifically its effect on higher educa
tion and the university.
The expression, ''The thought of
the time," as generally made use
of, is not accurately descriptive.
Strictly speaking, the thought of
any time has its manifold expres-

sion in Jill thiit, the people of the
time do or produce, whether it he
in the form of manufacture, works
of art, customs, institutions, or the
varied forms of written expression
that have come from them. Hut
the expression is more usually lim
ited to those more formal products
of mental activity represented hy
its literature, systems of philoso
phy, and formal sciences.
The enumeration of the triumphs
of science frequently includes only
the list of remarkable appliances
for bettering our material life. Hut
the scientific method has also be
gun to affect most profoundly the
other side of human life. It
is revolutionizing the methods of
thought in all phases of mental ac-
The progress here has been more
slow, uncertain, and unsuccessful.
Men are more ready to change the
appliances of a new home, the
methods of travel and communica
tion, and even their methods of
thinking in business relations and
active life, than the}' are to change

in all those matters not immediately
connected with material life in which
there is a fierce and definite compe
tition. But a brief examination
will show the profound influence of
this method.
Turning back to the most pros
perous age of Greece, we find the
Greeks sympathetic lovers of na
ture, as their life and art have
shown. They were students, too,
of nature, groping not wholly
blindly, as demonstrated by many
of their conceptions that have
passed down to us. There arose
among them Socrates and Plato —
the teacher, and his literary exec
utor and expounder. With the
purest and best of motives they un
consciously did the race a disser
vice that became a bar to progress
for the ages that followed. They
sought fundamental truths with the
commendable purpose of settlingall
questions of ethics for all time.
If the universe is the product of
fundamental principles, the long
ages of succession of events, with
their differentiation, synthesis, and
evolution, have complicated matters

immensely and buried fundamental
principles so deep that it is impossi
ble to discover them, in the external
universe. Consequently, not quickly
finding their required principles
and definitions in this external uni
verse of nature, and without un
derstanding why the universe could
not furnish them, they turned their
inquiries within. And the mind is
so constituted that it can make any
hypotheses and then proceed to
build a system logically based on
them. Hence they had no trouble
to obtain the definitions required.
These were of ihe mind alone.
Then to defend and hold these it
was necessary to do away with the
rest of the universe. So from that
time on, mind was the universe;
mind and matter had nothing in
common. Nature was to be over
looked, despised, and shunned as
gross, corrupting matter, and only
flights of mind were real and worth
any serious consideration.
This whole legitimate outcome
did not immediately follow on the
innocent diversions of Plato. It

whs not until after Aristotle—whose
genius won him a place of go large
authority—had taken up these
phases of thinking and put them
in form to he used that they came
to exert so extensive and powerful
an influence. Aristotle was him
self in a way a student of nature of
great promise. But to his large
line of successors, hardly followers,
the mental flights were more at
tractive than his bugs and fishes.
So the world went into the occupa
tion of what has been stvled "pure
thinking"; that is, thinking not con
ditioned by the presence of any fact
of the gross universe.
Then arose one after another the
so-called great thinkers, men who
solved all things by introspection
and contemplation. Then the sys
tems of philosophy spread over
Western Europe like cobwebs over
a lawn of a summer morning. The
early writers of the Christian
Church, tlie Christian fathers, also
wove a tissue of theology by the
methods and with the inspiration
of Plato. And thus the warp and
woof of the intellectual life of ages
consist of what has been styled
the "lazy philosophy of Plato."
The church, the state, and the
schools, literature and art, were
dominated by the methods which
seek fundamental principles by in
trospection and on them build each
its peculiar structure, by the con
ception that the mind of man was
the center and content of the uni
verse, and all else was either gross
or unreal. Investigation and col
lection of facts were not only un
necessary, but they all belonged to
that netherworld which could only
serve the purpose of interfering
with the lofty movement of pure
thought.
Through all this long period of
pure thinking no contribution of
value to progress can be pointed out.
At long intervals protests appeared
against the extreme conditions
brought on by these methods.
These protests culminated in the
Renaissance and the Reformation.
These movements were the express
ion of the true instinctive love of
man for nature and the real. They
brought new life again into the
world, but their leaders could never
shake themselves clear of the very
methods whose results they opposed.
It was with them the instinct to
return to the true position without
the training to maintain it. Con
sequently their movements, re
freshing as showers after a long
drought, produced no far-reaching
radical changes and but slow and
diversified progress. They were
rather a rush to the enjoyment
of nature once more, and not a
serious study of her, while the
methods of thinking were little
changed.
Thus matters stood until the be
ginning of the present century; and
with this immense past and the
slavish reverence for the past these
conceptions and methods, like the
"Old Man of the Sea," still hang
upon the neck of the present move
ment. Hut as this lusty giant grows,
the "Old Man's" days are num
bered.
All through the darkest of this
unproductive period, real students
of nature, scattered here and there,
more or less stifled by the attno

sphere of the times, kept alive,
smouldering and almost extin
guished as it often was, coals of the
true lire which was to blaze out in
such a conflagration as we are now
witnessing, from which is to come a
new and more glorious world.
Before the beginning of the pres
ent century the number of students
of nature was steadily increasing.
The feeling was growing, and indeed
was sometimes expressed by them,
that no thinking or conclusion is
warranted except that based on
facts —facts became of extreme
importance; and no end of labor
and pains was spent to obtain
them. They again and again re
paid all this labor by yielding the
most wonderful discoveries, famil
iar to all acquainted with the his
tory of science.
Thus slowly and surely grew into
tangible shape what we know as the
scientific method —a method which
has been described by Huxley as the
"method of common sense," a
method which simply demands an
accurate knowledge of the facts be
fore describing their relations.
Its value plainly demonstrated
and once clearly conceived, it has
become the plain and simple instru
ment that has made these magnifi
cent conquests in the world of our
material life; and now we have the
spectacle of its vigorous effect on
the matters and methods of those
things usually designated as of the
mind.
We have but to pass in rapid re
view the state of the knowledge of
today and that of recent years to
obtain our evidence.
All of the old nature subjects,
physical and biological, have been
completely revolutionized. Within
them whole groups of elaborate sci
ences have been created, and all of
these have progressed with remark
able rapidity. All those subjects not
classed with the nature subjects
have also felt the influence of the
creative power of the scientific
method, for within the bounds of the
humanities this breath of life is
transforming everything and bring
ing into birth the healthy begin
nings of many sciences.
The immeasurable success at
tained in a short period of years in
the study of nature by the scientific
method, contrasted with the abso
lute lack of progress which was the
result of othef methods, forced it
self on the attention of those really
seeking truth in other lines of
thought. As a consequence students
of history, of social institutions and
problems, of language, of mental
phenomena, and even of ethics and
philosophy, to a greater or less ex
tent have introduced the scientific
method into their work.
A comparison of the state of each
of these lines of human thought of
today with that of fifty years ago
shows astonishing changes.
To illustrate: As we have exem
plified so well among us here, his
tory is no loner merely the more or
less interesting accounts of the con
spicuous persons and events of a
nation's life, based on facts not ac
curately obtained, colored bv the
prejudices or literary ambition of
those describing them; often, it is
true, it is unified into a semblance
of completeness by constructing the
whole on a plan—a plan, however,
which is the result of an attempt to
illustrate principles which have
been preconceived by the author.
Indeed the history of the past is
chiefly the works of authors.
The history of the present is quite
a different matter. The history of
the past is to the historical science
of the present what the interesting
stories of dogs, elephants, and curi

ous plants are to that complex of
sciences which has for its object the
explanation of the laws by which all
living beings have come in their
manifold forms to be occupying
their diverse positions and main
taining their overwhelming and
complex relations with one another
and all the world beside.
In like manner, history at the
present time is a vigorous science.
It proposes to solve a thousand
problems of the development of the
life of the human race. Its ma
terial is of that broad extent that it
includes every fact and every act of
all peoples of all times. It views
the earth covered with diversified
peoples of different languages, cus
toms, institutions, occupations, and
beliefs. It sees these as innumer
able differentiations of original com
mon antecedents. It proposes to
ascertain as far as possible the facts
of the progress of this differentia
tion and development, and from
these facts discover the laws that
have wrought so many diverse
forms of community life, so many
forms of thought and activity.
The problems are vast. The ma
terial of the past too scant by far, it
is true, still the scientific method of
research is multiplying the mater
ial immensely. And the great re
spect that the scientific spirit has
engendered has driven the present
to begin to make most extensive re
cords of its acts, so that the future
historian will not lack for data.
His labors will even be greater and
more slow, but they will give real
products.
Not all students and workers in
history have fully caught the scien
tific spirit nor have comprehended
the vastness and grandeur of the
work that the method of science
has demonstrated possible for them.
History is still to them the source of
themes for the production of litera
ture, instead of being a magnificent
structure to whose building they
will contribute. Thus the lines be
tween history and biology are dis
appearing, and history lias become
thoroughly a natural science with
the most complex of all problems,
demanding the most rigid methods.
The scientific spirit has not changed
the writer of history alone but lias
also affected his audience. We are
no longer satisfied with the aul lior's
emotions in respect to Caesar's cros
sing the Rubicon, or Washington's
crossing the Deleware. We wish
from liini a certified picture of the
scene and an accurate determina
tion of its place in the movement
of which it is a pari; and we will
furnish our own emotions.
The social sciences have been also
greatly affected by the example of
these scientific methods, although
they are still largely in the hands
of the theorists. There are arising
among its students those who have
a deej) and earnest desire to come
face to face with the real facts of so
cial life and their relations and laws
of development. They are recogniz
ing that these problems are of the
most difficult and complex nature
and above all require accu
rate quantitative determination.
Theories in regard to products and
their distribution in regard to busi
ness and legislation, do hot with
them precede the knowledge of the
real facts of these great occupations.
They will show how such facts as
the invention of a process of
making steel has affected transpor
tation, distribution, and business
and other relations more than have
works on the principles of political
economy. May their tribe increase!
In the region of the study of lan
guage the scientific method has
given us within the space of a com

paratively few years the great and
important science of philology,
with its many departments —the
first successful attempt at a rational
view of language in all the long
period of language study. The im
petus thus given to active and vig
orous research in a domain of knowl
edge that had become dead and
profitless in the extreme, is in itself
sufficient proof of the value of this
method. Time does not permit the
account of how one after another
the other fields of intellectual activ
ity have come or are corning to feel
the tonic influence of science. It
would be interesting to know what
is to become of philosophy. But as
indications point, the forecast would
bean ungrateful task. Two or three
tlr.ngs must happen. She must
give up that solemn bluff that the
philosopher knows more of each
science than any of the specialists
in the sciences know. She must
give up her function of being the
science of all sciences. The philoso
pher who would attempt to corre
late all the sciences of today might
as well singly and alone attempt to
digest all the agricultural products
of America in a single year.
Science, its method and its pro
ducts having furnished the envir
onment of our life, having opened
up to us vast fields of knowledge
and thus having permeated every
form of literature, and having
demonstrated the only successful
method thus far hit upon for ascer
taining truth, and thus having com
pelled change in the general
methods of thought —in short, hav
ing created a new heaven and a
new earth —it was but a natural
demand that it should forma part
of the educational system, which
might reasonably be supposed to
prepare for living in this new uni
verse.
At least in England and America
nothing has been more conservative
than t he system of education. The
schools for higher education in
hardly any manner reflected the
vital knowledge and the actual dis
cussions of the times in which they
existed. Their aitnsasfar as they can
be ascertained were such that they
had no need to deal with any form
of real and useful knowledge. It
was claimed that they were to give
training and culture. The training
was mainly of a few specific forms
of memory and feats of mental
legerdemain, but the culture was
undeniable unmistakable, very
unctuous, and glowed with a soft
light. Its possessor was known as
a scholar.
The subjects used for this train
ing had become traditional and
were for the most part conven
tional. These studies were in no
way in touch with the active world
outside. The occupations and meth
ods of thought were precisely of
that nature to make members of
this community despise all mate
rial facts and shun all contact
with material objects.
This isolated and narrow life cre
ated a community peculiar to itself
and jealous of its peculiarities.
They created for themselves an ex
clusive caste, the members worship
ing one another and despising all
the world beside, and in turn
mildly despised by the world when
it happened to think of them.
All this did not seem so out of
place in England, where still the
land is dotted with Mediaeval
ruins, and people are still employed
to keep fresh the blood-stains of
many who were beheaded by a Me
diaeval faith. But in America,
where poverty forbade the main
taining the full livery of all this,
the incongruity was very striking.

The more intense intellectual
life grown up outside of the uni
versities created a wider demand
fora preparation to live it. Nat
urally the universities were sought
to gratify this demand. But this
old regime did not satisfy those
who looked forward to a career not
within the lines of theology and
philosophy. Some inkling at least
of those great conquests in the
realms of nature were begged for in
the short intervals in Latin prose
in grinding out Latin verses. Thus
science came in first as a sort of in
dulgence. She occupied the nooks
and corners. She appeared only
in the mild form of lectures on the
most conspicuous and interesting
phenomena of nature. It was not
imagined (hat it did or could con
tribute to the training and culture
which it was the peculiar func
tion of the university to give.
Hut these beginnings were the com
mencement of and awakening of a
new university life. It was the
opening of a cleft in the walls, al
lowing a beam of the light of day
unclouded by smoke of incense, not
distorted by stained glass, to pene
trate into the great structure.
The mere statement of the con
quests that had been made over
nature carried with it the evi
dence of the great progress of the
world outside and beyond the uni
versity. It showed that already
knowledge and life had become so
vast and so intense that the old
routine could not serve for it.
With a few of the meager facts of
science first introduced came next
into the university the methods of
science. Then appeared the lal(or
atories as a means of education.
This made the connection between
the university and the rest of the
world. In the laboratories real
and tangible facts and the inquir
ing mind were in the university
brought face to face, and the true
method of the solution of the one
by the other demonstrated. This
touch of reality brought about a
series of results in higher education
which are revolutionizingand must
continue to revolutionize our con
ceptions of its aim and content.
The real universe is vastly greater
and more magnificent than any
imagined one. The innermost re
cess of our nature vibrates to real
contact with the actual universe.
It is a partand product of it. It grew
by the means of the external uni
verse, and is still to grow by that
means.
Those in the University who felt
the tonic of a breath of a real at
mosphere soon demanded reality in
other knowledge than that of na
ture. The student after seeing and
trying the careful method of the
scientist who patiently and with
great labor and with every guard
against prejudice gathered a great
number of facts, and looked to
these and these alone for his con
clusions, and when these con
clusions thus produced seemed
somewhat real, could no longer
with patience listen to an historical
discourse which was the work of
imagination, an announcement of
the most profound and far-reaching
conclusions in economic science
which had their source only in
principles assumed in the begin
ning by the author, or a course in
the science of the mind which did
not deal with ascertained real facts
of the mind; and least of all could
he listen with patience to the ex
pounding of a system of philosophy
which assumed to comprehend all
sciences and correlate them with
out a knowledge of a single one of
them.
The student from the laboratory
who has felt its meaning and
caught its spirit knows that all
these things are thin air thrown
into vibrations, and that the same
air might as well have vibrated in
any other combination. Conse
quently he demands the same sort
of knowledge and the same cer
tainty in it in other lines of study.
He who has felt the keen pleasure
and satisfaction of a quantitative
determination of a piece of knowl
edge can not but look with some
thing of contempt on mere opinion
and effusive statement.
It is these demands that have
shaken up many oi the old subjects
and the old methods. Another ex
tremely important effect has been
the introduction and strengthening
of other lines of study not gener
ally classed as scientific which
were practically outside the system
of education; that is, the group
known as the humanities, subjects
which are often wrongly assumed
as opposed to the sciences.
While the teaching of Plato that
separated mind from matter still
influences largely the thought of
our time, yet the time is fast ap
proaching when all lines of sep
aration will disappear, and man in
all his phases will be considered
and treated as a part of nature.
There is now every day wider ex
tension of the demand of real
knowledge in regard to all things
pertaining to man. This is the di
rect result of this taste for reality
that the scientific spirit has begot
ten. In consequence there are now
in the universities side by side with
the sciences the great studies his
tory, economics, literature, and art.
These with the sciences were almost
unknown in the higher schools in
their true sense fifty years ago in
this country and in England.
Science has also discovered, dig
nified, and given a deeper meaning
to still other phases of human ac
tivity. The mechanical and in
dustrial arts have felt in the most
wonderful manner its creative in
fluence, and to this they owe the
positions they are coming to take
among the results of productive
thinking. The prejudice bred by
the long use of a narrow definition
of culture kept these subjects out of
the educational courses, hut it is
beginning to be realized that it
may be as much worth while to
understand the making of the com
plex and finished products of the
present age as it is to contemplate
the rude implements of a past one.
Today still, in the courses in the
elementary and secondary schools,
the most conservative and Plato
ridden institutions that remain to
us, there is given a meager place to
the knowledge of man and of na
ture; that is, the sciences, history,
literature, and art. But the time
is at hand when that self-sufficient
philosophy which so largely domi
nates the thought in our lower
schools must succumb to the move
ments of the times. Then the
children and youth, through the
very periods of growth and develop
ment, when they can best catch the
spirit and form the habits of the
advanced age in which they live,
instead of being systematically
hedged in from all contact with it,
will be intelligently induced into
its spirit, made familiar with
its product and drilled in its
methods. When they leave the
schools they will be immediately at
home in the world about them, and
can successfully face it.
Theologians, Hegelians, and Pla
tonists of whatever twist have
cause to fear the scientific method;
but least of all should the student
of the humanities make faces at

the scientist, and become emo
tional, not to say hysterical, at the
scientific method, as was recently
the case with an earnest student
history. There is, of course, an op
portunity sometimes for ilie his
torian to be moved with the spirit
of the antiquarian, and as becomes
upon some of the admirable fig
ures that have crossed the stage in
the past, to bemoan the times that
no longer produce in exact detail
these tine old characters.
The dignified scholar, the fine
old gentleman glowing with the
culture of the old school, awakens
our enthusiastic admiration, and
even love, as we unearth him from
the times in which he lived; still
we need not mourn that no one
now who is strong enough to be
come such a one is willing to do
so, any more than he would desire
to wear a queue, three-cornered
hat and shoe buckles and hunt
ducks with a blunderbuss. Then
we may console ourselves with the
recollection of the many other things
which of necessity were contem
poraneous with this fine old gen
tleman, and happily have passed
awav with him.
How inane in any ease are these
wails against science and the
scientific method and the changes
they are working out. The scien
tific method is so constructed that
it can overturn nothing but error,
and if one's investments do not lie
in that direction why worry any
longer about it?
The plea that science unfits one
for the enjoyment of that side of
nature and life which it is the
office of art and literature to ex
press is an equally shallow one.
How can knowing the truth more
deeply, cause us to see less of beauty,
or to have less of feeling in all
that appeals to us?
While we may be wrapt in ad
miration at the grandeur of a mount
ain, and watch with awe the effect
of changing tint and color of
mountain, skv, and darkening val
ley, as the painting of a setting
sun carries them all through a
most wonderful program, our emo
tions will be none the less or ex
pansion of soul le>s great if we
also see that mountain a monu
ment erected as the resultant of
great forces that have through ages
been at work on its structure and
form. Science does not prevent
our seeing the beauty of the scene,
but lends vastly to Ihe effect by
making it, instead of a momentary
display of color with no more mean
ing than we can conjure up, a veri
table height from which we get a
glimpse of the real living universe
greater than any imagined one. So
with every bird, flower, or gem, and
every phenomenon of nature.
Science does not do away with
beauty of form or color or grace of
motion, but gives to all these a
deeper meaning. It may be true
that scientists do not usually rave
about these things, and do not par
ticularly enjoy the ravings of
others. They have passed the rav
ing period, and have reached that
of deep self-sacrificing devotion.
All such talk as abusing Newton
for the "analysis of the rainbow,"
or shuddering because "science
teaches the youth to analyze his
mother's tears," and the like, are
either hysterical or sensational.
The same quantitative study and
rigid application of the method of
science must give ;i deeper meaning
to the facts within the realm of the
study of man; nor can it lessen
feeling in regard to him. It will
surely often change .»ur point of
view and change our conceptions of
the value of things. The scientific

method is not going to deprive us
<>112 the power of crying, but will
clear up things so that we can cry
over the right things—in other
words, cry more intelligently.
The scientific method has been
correctly described as the method
of "common sense." And to say
as was recently said in a promi
nent address, "'beware of the scien
tific method" in studies of history,
is to decry the extension of com
mon sense into these regions.
The new evils of which we are
hearing so much as the result of
science arise rather from those who
have taken up the name and some
what of the language of science,
and not its real method and spirit.
In all times there have been those
who, seeking to gain somewhat
of prominence and authority for
what they have to say or do, have
posed as members of a strong or
popular party. Science has become
popular and much respected, con
sequently there have come to at
tempt to enroll with her votaries
great motley crowds of those who
write and speak, who catch up
some of her language, take on
something of her air, and with
them promulgate as her teachings
all the various vagaries that the
human mind is heir to. There re
sults in this time of change and
lack of scientific education much
confusion and distrust of science.
Th s is increased l»y still another
group of quite a different stamp.
They are honest and earnest and in
their work wish to use, indeed
think tliey are using, the scientific
method; but unfortunately for all
concerned they have no true con
ception of it, nor have they ever
rationally attempted to gain such a
conception. These people would not
think of attempting to calculate an
eclipse or build a steam-engine
without the years of preparation
for such work, but do not hesitate
to attempt far more difficult prob
lems which only the scientific
method 'will solve, without any
preparation for the work.
But evils and confusion arising
from these causes will right them
selves in time, for the tests are so
(dear that those who know how to
employ them may with reason
able certainty distinguish the'
true method from its imitation,
and the number of such good
judges is rapidly increasing.
The warning then should be
not to heware of the scientific
method, but to beware of attempt
ing to proceed in any direction
without its being most rigorously
applied. And while it is true that
the scientific method applied to the
study of chemistry and physics
"'has not made history a whit easier
to understai d," the application of
the scientific method to history has
already begun to unravel some of
its problems, and it seems sure
nothing else will accomplish this.
While it is too much to expect
that the habits of thought that
have dominated for two centuries
will pass promptly and without
many sorrows, yet tliey are passing
as the unprofitable must pass.
The scientific method does not
promise panaceas, hut it insures a
healthy life by showing that they
do not exist. As we see things
now the scientific method can do
all that can be done, and that
seems to be the conclusion of the
whole matter.
While viewing with great pleas
ure the service that science has
done higher education, we can not
escape the fact that the scientific
spirit has suffered somewhat by its
contact with the university. When
science was conquering the world,

it was living its heroic age. Its
followers were true heroes. Devo
tion, love, self-sacrifice, and courage,
without hope of any reward from
the world outside, constituted their
life. Their motives were of the
purest and loftiest. With the suc
cess of science there have come
other conditions, and now there
are also other motives for the pur
suit of science. In the universities
the science subjects have been com
pelled more or less to conform to
the routine already existing in
them. The subjects in the uni
versities form parts of formal
courses, which are <>112 more or less
artificial groups. These lead to de
grees and other distinctions. Thus
motives are created for the study
of science which are entirely for
eign to the spirit and content of
any science. Indeed the rivalry of
schools has become such that many
forms of bait have been resorted to
in order to lure people on to fur
ther study in the university courses,
such as prizes, degrees, scholar
ships, fellowships, and distinctions
of various kinds. Thus there come
to be mingled together with those
who study science for its own sake
many who pursue it for some ul
terior motive. This has brought
out a host of unscrupulous little in
tellects who in the various de
partments of science are boring in
every conceivable direction and are
describing with the most tiresome
details their minutest chips, and
often with it wasting good money
in expensive lithographs. Their
products are becoming so numerous
and intermingled with real works
that it requires great labor to sift
them out. But this is not the
greatest harm. The most serious
evil is the robbing the true spirit
of science of the power it posessess
when it alone is the motive.
What will be the final outcome?
Will science, which has already
done so much to make rational
the university courses, which has
pierced so many bubbles and cor
roded so many baubles, be able
finally to make all conventional
trivialities of the university disap
pear? Already a large number of
those who enter the universities do
so for the preparation for work they
have in mind. To such the arti
ficial stimuli count for nothing.
May we not hope for the time when
it will be seen that the university
does a great harm in proposing
either directly or indirectly any
other motive than those its sub
jects carry with them? Should the
university encourage in its students
such an absurd class of questions
as "How much chemistry or his
tory shall I take to get one degree,
and how much add to this to get
another?"
And then when one has increased
in knowledge or grown in spirit
why should he wish a certificate t >
that effect or receive a distinguish
ing mark? Most curious of all is
the millinery method of desig
nating stages of intellectual de
velopment. For example, a cer
tain development of soul, shown by
a hood with a yellow border; cap
carrying a rectangular figure on
top probably indicates the mind
having reached two dimensions;
a certain refinement of spirit, indi
cated by sleeves of gown neatly
edged with gold braid; certain very
lofty aspirations realized, collar
turned up, gown long, cut bias and
gored with black darts of velvet; a
combination of ail those grand
motherly qualities that allows one
to preside over this gentle throne,
and thus be a true alma mater,
gown very full with plenty of
white lace. Now it is thought vul
gar for one to display his material
wealth, or for an Indian to boast
of heinga big one. Can one with
any greater propriety assume a halo
because he has learned a certain
group of things?
The systems of education which
we have, both elementary and
higher, are in great part an in
heritance from times long preced
ing our own. Whether they were
suited to those times and what were
the reasons for their forms is of
little consequence to us now as far
as the organization of a system for
our own times is concerned. Hut
as a matter of fact it is made of
great consequence from the un
reasoning fear and distaste to
changing what has once been in
such matters. We have here too
much reverence for the past, sim
ply from the halo that the past
often gives things, incongruous as
they may have been when they
existed. Indeed the fact thai any
system belonged to the past, should
in itself lead us to suspect it, as it
was adapted to times that, from the
nature of things, could not be like
our own. From their hallowed as
sociations, to attempt to use the
wooden plough that the Romans
used, to plough the great ranches of
California would not only be an
example of maudlin sentimentality,
but would reduce California to the
condition in which it was when it
was formerly under control of a
Latin civilization. The wooden
plough and its contemporary ideas
may properly find a place in the
museum of a university, butshould
not form any part of its working
organization.
Nor should the conception that
the educational system is the result
of an evolution be made the ex
cuse for retaining useless parts
that have come to us from the past
as sort of rudimentary organs to
remind us of its origin. The laws
of organic growth and heredity do
not hold here. Hut as the builder
of a steamship is free to ignore all
the steps in the evolution of the
parts of a modern vessel, and
choose the best material and latest
devices that mechanical engineering
has to offer, so in our educational
system there is nothing in its na
ture to prevent our making it what
we please.
When we come to consider the
vastness of well-ordered real knowl-i
edge at the present time, the in-1
tensity of intellectual activity, the
great number of important prob
lems thrust upon us, the crowds of
errors as well as the multitudes of
truths that crowd upon our judg-i
ment, and the tierce competition on
every hand, requiring the best
equipment in modern knowledge
and method, there is the most ur
gent reason that our educational
system be cleared of everything
that interferes with its cleanest ac
tion.
The elementary system needs no
longer the endless patching up of
its motley mixture, the strange re
sult of necessity, empiricism, and
accident. It has had enough of
the fanciful apologies of the phi
losophers for its existence, and of
mystic pictures of its fancied rela
tions to an imagined soul. It
needs to be completely reorganized
from the foundation and put in
relation to the life of today.
As for our higher schools, the
universities, they have become
freer to react to the times. They
are every year becoming less under
the influence of the inane and in
active scholasticism which made

the most narrow of definitions of
culture and set her up as a goddess
and established about her a puerile
ritual and a most bigoted hierarchy.
First in Germany and then in
America the university broke away,
or is breaking away from these
bonils.
The university is no longer to be
simply the conservator of the past.
It should be the leader and stimu
lus of the present and the prophet
of the future. Every phase of in
tellectual activity should have its
place in the university, where will
he gathered its literature, where
may be collected its facts, and
where will be grouped masters in
its science who stand ready to im
part its spirit and drill in its
methods. Throughout the whole
will prevail thoroughly the scien
tific spirit and method, and that
complete freedom in choice of sub
jects and career absolutely neces
sary to strongest development.
Our own university in America
most nearly approaches in spirit
such nn ideal, and if such a life
here is not universal it is at least,
possible to all, and many there be
who live with enthusiasm up to this
possibility. 1 congratulate you
that during your eduoational career
you have had the possibility of
breathing with freedom something
of the spirit of the times. May
you that go and you that remain
vividly appreciate this too rare a
privilege, and cultivate and guard
most jealously this spirit. May it
become an instinct with us. May
we be quick to resent and ever ar
dent to oppose any taint of the old
regime which may seek admission
among us, and thus threaten our
freedom and undermine our intel
lectual manhood.
The stupendous changes that
have been wrought in the material
life of the civilized races in a short
period of time by the progress of
modern science have been generally
recognized. We have to make only a
casual investigation into the history
of the production of the things that
would come under our view at our
first turn, to find complete revolu
tion in production, manufacture,
and distribution. We find further
that it is not in each a single change,
but revolution on revolution the
most radical. For example, in le*s
than twenty-live years the immense
and complicated bus.ness of transit
in our cities has passed from omni
bus to horse car, from horse car to the
cable system, from the cable system
to the electric car system, with
special variations in the way of ele
vated railroads and pneumatic rail
ways. Methods of lighting, heat
ing, production and transference of
power for motors, have passed
through equal strides of change and
improvement. Everything con
nected with the immense business
of t transportation, from the great un
dertaking of bridge building and
steamship structures down to the
sealing of a freight car or the exca
vation of a yard of rock, has in a
like period passed through radical
revolutions that are bewildering in
their rapidity and in the greatness
of the interests involved.
This change and this advance
have appeared not alone in these
large and conspicuous phenomena
of activity, but in the countless
other lines of human industry
change has followed change. Im
provement and advance on what
lias been just past have been the
constant movement of the time.
On account of the complex relations
that exist in a community, a single
new invention may greatly affect
many occupations other than the
one in which the invention is used.
Consequently as matters are now
going, it is beyond mental grasp to
comprehend the breadth and depth
of these changes. As the result of
them hosts of old occupations have
been destroyed, innumerable ones
have been completely and radically
revolutionized, and hosts of new ones
have been created. This has made
a wholesale destruction of old rela
tions and a wholesale creation of
new ones. And with all this have
come and still must come the most
severe strains on the structure of the
community in the readjustment of
these relations.
This condition of the present time
appears more striking when we con
sider that more and greater changes
have occurred in the material life
of thecommunity and the adjust
ments these have brought with
them in the last ten years than have
occurred in any thousand years pre
vious to the ninteenth century.
It is agreed on all hands that all
these marvels of change and im
provement in the setting of our ma
terial life have been the result of
the application of the scientific
method to t he study of nature. Kven
those who suspect science and decry
the scientific method and warn the
elect against both, acknowledge the
service that science has done for

what tliey style the material man.
They, as promptly as others, de
mand of the hotels, railroads, ar
chitects, and publishing houses that
they take advantage in every way
of the latest that science has to
offer. We have no longer, then,
to contend for what science has ac
complished for this side of human
life.
These marvels are of profound
interest and with an outcome im
possible to foresee; but interesting
and significant as these results of
science are, it is still another phase
of the effect of the modern scien
tific method that shall detain us at
ibis moment. Too large it is and
too comprehensive —too far-reach
ing to be brought to more than
mere notice in so short a time. It
is the effect of science on the
thought of the time, and more spe
cifically its effect on higher educa
tion and the university.
The expression, ''The thought of
the time," as generally made use
of, is not accurately descriptive.
Strictly speaking, the thought of
any time has its manifold expres-

sion in Jill thiit, the people of the
time do or produce, whether it he
in the form of manufacture, works
of art, customs, institutions, or the
varied forms of written expression
that have come from them. Hut
the expression is more usually lim
ited to those more formal products
of mental activity represented hy
its literature, systems of philoso
phy, and formal sciences.
The enumeration of the triumphs
of science frequently includes only
the list of remarkable appliances
for bettering our material life. Hut
the scientific method has also be
gun to affect most profoundly the
other side of human life. It
is revolutionizing the methods of
thought in all phases of mental ac-
The progress here has been more
slow, uncertain, and unsuccessful.
Men are more ready to change the
appliances of a new home, the
methods of travel and communica
tion, and even their methods of
thinking in business relations and
active life, than the}' are to change

in all those matters not immediately
connected with material life in which
there is a fierce and definite compe
tition. But a brief examination
will show the profound influence of
this method.
Turning back to the most pros
perous age of Greece, we find the
Greeks sympathetic lovers of na
ture, as their life and art have
shown. They were students, too,
of nature, groping not wholly
blindly, as demonstrated by many
of their conceptions that have
passed down to us. There arose
among them Socrates and Plato —
the teacher, and his literary exec
utor and expounder. With the
purest and best of motives they un
consciously did the race a disser
vice that became a bar to progress
for the ages that followed. They
sought fundamental truths with the
commendable purpose of settlingall
questions of ethics for all time.
If the universe is the product of
fundamental principles, the long
ages of succession of events, with
their differentiation, synthesis, and
evolution, have complicated matters

immensely and buried fundamental
principles so deep that it is impossi
ble to discover them, in the external
universe. Consequently, not quickly
finding their required principles
and definitions in this external uni
verse of nature, and without un
derstanding why the universe could
not furnish them, they turned their
inquiries within. And the mind is
so constituted that it can make any
hypotheses and then proceed to
build a system logically based on
them. Hence they had no trouble
to obtain the definitions required.
These were of ihe mind alone.
Then to defend and hold these it
was necessary to do away with the
rest of the universe. So from that
time on, mind was the universe;
mind and matter had nothing in
common. Nature was to be over
looked, despised, and shunned as
gross, corrupting matter, and only
flights of mind were real and worth
any serious consideration.
This whole legitimate outcome
did not immediately follow on the
innocent diversions of Plato. It

whs not until after Aristotle—whose
genius won him a place of go large
authority—had taken up these
phases of thinking and put them
in form to he used that they came
to exert so extensive and powerful
an influence. Aristotle was him
self in a way a student of nature of
great promise. But to his large
line of successors, hardly followers,
the mental flights were more at
tractive than his bugs and fishes.
So the world went into the occupa
tion of what has been stvled "pure
thinking"; that is, thinking not con
ditioned by the presence of any fact
of the gross universe.
Then arose one after another the
so-called great thinkers, men who
solved all things by introspection
and contemplation. Then the sys
tems of philosophy spread over
Western Europe like cobwebs over
a lawn of a summer morning. The
early writers of the Christian
Church, tlie Christian fathers, also
wove a tissue of theology by the
methods and with the inspiration
of Plato. And thus the warp and
woof of the intellectual life of ages
consist of what has been styled
the "lazy philosophy of Plato."
The church, the state, and the
schools, literature and art, were
dominated by the methods which
seek fundamental principles by in
trospection and on them build each
its peculiar structure, by the con
ception that the mind of man was
the center and content of the uni
verse, and all else was either gross
or unreal. Investigation and col
lection of facts were not only un
necessary, but they all belonged to
that netherworld which could only
serve the purpose of interfering
with the lofty movement of pure
thought.
Through all this long period of
pure thinking no contribution of
value to progress can be pointed out.
At long intervals protests appeared
against the extreme conditions
brought on by these methods.
These protests culminated in the
Renaissance and the Reformation.
These movements were the express
ion of the true instinctive love of
man for nature and the real. They
brought new life again into the
world, but their leaders could never
shake themselves clear of the very
methods whose results they opposed.
It was with them the instinct to
return to the true position without
the training to maintain it. Con
sequently their movements, re
freshing as showers after a long
drought, produced no far-reaching
radical changes and but slow and
diversified progress. They were
rather a rush to the enjoyment
of nature once more, and not a
serious study of her, while the
methods of thinking were little
changed.
Thus matters stood until the be
ginning of the present century; and
with this immense past and the
slavish reverence for the past these
conceptions and methods, like the
"Old Man of the Sea," still hang
upon the neck of the present move
ment. Hut as this lusty giant grows,
the "Old Man's" days are num
bered.
All through the darkest of this
unproductive period, real students
of nature, scattered here and there,
more or less stifled by the attno

sphere of the times, kept alive,
smouldering and almost extin
guished as it often was, coals of the
true lire which was to blaze out in
such a conflagration as we are now
witnessing, from which is to come a
new and more glorious world.
Before the beginning of the pres
ent century the number of students
of nature was steadily increasing.
The feeling was growing, and indeed
was sometimes expressed by them,
that no thinking or conclusion is
warranted except that based on
facts —facts became of extreme
importance; and no end of labor
and pains was spent to obtain
them. They again and again re
paid all this labor by yielding the
most wonderful discoveries, famil
iar to all acquainted with the his
tory of science.
Thus slowly and surely grew into
tangible shape what we know as the
scientific method —a method which
has been described by Huxley as the
"method of common sense," a
method which simply demands an
accurate knowledge of the facts be
fore describing their relations.
Its value plainly demonstrated
and once clearly conceived, it has
become the plain and simple instru
ment that has made these magnifi
cent conquests in the world of our
material life; and now we have the
spectacle of its vigorous effect on
the matters and methods of those
things usually designated as of the
mind.
We have but to pass in rapid re
view the state of the knowledge of
today and that of recent years to
obtain our evidence.
All of the old nature subjects,
physical and biological, have been
completely revolutionized. Within
them whole groups of elaborate sci
ences have been created, and all of
these have progressed with remark
able rapidity. All those subjects not
classed with the nature subjects
have also felt the influence of the
creative power of the scientific
method, for within the bounds of the
humanities this breath of life is
transforming everything and bring
ing into birth the healthy begin
nings of many sciences.
The immeasurable success at
tained in a short period of years in
the study of nature by the scientific
method, contrasted with the abso
lute lack of progress which was the
result of othef methods, forced it
self on the attention of those really
seeking truth in other lines of
thought. As a consequence students
of history, of social institutions and
problems, of language, of mental
phenomena, and even of ethics and
philosophy, to a greater or less ex
tent have introduced the scientific
method into their work.
A comparison of the state of each
of these lines of human thought of
today with that of fifty years ago
shows astonishing changes.
To illustrate: As we have exem
plified so well among us here, his
tory is no loner merely the more or
less interesting accounts of the con
spicuous persons and events of a
nation's life, based on facts not ac
curately obtained, colored bv the
prejudices or literary ambition of
those describing them; often, it is
true, it is unified into a semblance
of completeness by constructing the
whole on a plan—a plan, however,
which is the result of an attempt to
illustrate principles which have
been preconceived by the author.
Indeed the history of the past is
chiefly the works of authors.
The history of the present is quite
a different matter. The history of
the past is to the historical science
of the present what the interesting
stories of dogs, elephants, and curi

ous plants are to that complex of
sciences which has for its object the
explanation of the laws by which all
living beings have come in their
manifold forms to be occupying
their diverse positions and main
taining their overwhelming and
complex relations with one another
and all the world beside.
In like manner, history at the
present time is a vigorous science.
It proposes to solve a thousand
problems of the development of the
life of the human race. Its ma
terial is of that broad extent that it
includes every fact and every act of
all peoples of all times. It views
the earth covered with diversified
peoples of different languages, cus
toms, institutions, occupations, and
beliefs. It sees these as innumer
able differentiations of original com
mon antecedents. It proposes to
ascertain as far as possible the facts
of the progress of this differentia
tion and development, and from
these facts discover the laws that
have wrought so many diverse
forms of community life, so many
forms of thought and activity.
The problems are vast. The ma
terial of the past too scant by far, it
is true, still the scientific method of
research is multiplying the mater
ial immensely. And the great re
spect that the scientific spirit has
engendered has driven the present
to begin to make most extensive re
cords of its acts, so that the future
historian will not lack for data.
His labors will even be greater and
more slow, but they will give real
products.
Not all students and workers in
history have fully caught the scien
tific spirit nor have comprehended
the vastness and grandeur of the
work that the method of science
has demonstrated possible for them.
History is still to them the source of
themes for the production of litera
ture, instead of being a magnificent
structure to whose building they
will contribute. Thus the lines be
tween history and biology are dis
appearing, and history lias become
thoroughly a natural science with
the most complex of all problems,
demanding the most rigid methods.
The scientific spirit has not changed
the writer of history alone but lias
also affected his audience. We are
no longer satisfied with the aul lior's
emotions in respect to Caesar's cros
sing the Rubicon, or Washington's
crossing the Deleware. We wish
from liini a certified picture of the
scene and an accurate determina
tion of its place in the movement
of which it is a pari; and we will
furnish our own emotions.
The social sciences have been also
greatly affected by the example of
these scientific methods, although
they are still largely in the hands
of the theorists. There are arising
among its students those who have
a deej) and earnest desire to come
face to face with the real facts of so
cial life and their relations and laws
of development. They are recogniz
ing that these problems are of the
most difficult and complex nature
and above all require accu
rate quantitative determination.
Theories in regard to products and
their distribution in regard to busi
ness and legislation, do hot with
them precede the knowledge of the
real facts of these great occupations.
They will show how such facts as
the invention of a process of
making steel has affected transpor
tation, distribution, and business
and other relations more than have
works on the principles of political
economy. May their tribe increase!
In the region of the study of lan
guage the scientific method has
given us within the space of a com

paratively few years the great and
important science of philology,
with its many departments —the
first successful attempt at a rational
view of language in all the long
period of language study. The im
petus thus given to active and vig
orous research in a domain of knowl
edge that had become dead and
profitless in the extreme, is in itself
sufficient proof of the value of this
method. Time does not permit the
account of how one after another
the other fields of intellectual activ
ity have come or are corning to feel
the tonic influence of science. It
would be interesting to know what
is to become of philosophy. But as
indications point, the forecast would
bean ungrateful task. Two or three
tlr.ngs must happen. She must
give up that solemn bluff that the
philosopher knows more of each
science than any of the specialists
in the sciences know. She must
give up her function of being the
science of all sciences. The philoso
pher who would attempt to corre
late all the sciences of today might
as well singly and alone attempt to
digest all the agricultural products
of America in a single year.
Science, its method and its pro
ducts having furnished the envir
onment of our life, having opened
up to us vast fields of knowledge
and thus having permeated every
form of literature, and having
demonstrated the only successful
method thus far hit upon for ascer
taining truth, and thus having com
pelled change in the general
methods of thought —in short, hav
ing created a new heaven and a
new earth —it was but a natural
demand that it should forma part
of the educational system, which
might reasonably be supposed to
prepare for living in this new uni
verse.
At least in England and America
nothing has been more conservative
than t he system of education. The
schools for higher education in
hardly any manner reflected the
vital knowledge and the actual dis
cussions of the times in which they
existed. Their aitnsasfar as they can
be ascertained were such that they
had no need to deal with any form
of real and useful knowledge. It
was claimed that they were to give
training and culture. The training
was mainly of a few specific forms
of memory and feats of mental
legerdemain, but the culture was
undeniable unmistakable, very
unctuous, and glowed with a soft
light. Its possessor was known as
a scholar.
The subjects used for this train
ing had become traditional and
were for the most part conven
tional. These studies were in no
way in touch with the active world
outside. The occupations and meth
ods of thought were precisely of
that nature to make members of
this community despise all mate
rial facts and shun all contact
with material objects.
This isolated and narrow life cre
ated a community peculiar to itself
and jealous of its peculiarities.
They created for themselves an ex
clusive caste, the members worship
ing one another and despising all
the world beside, and in turn
mildly despised by the world when
it happened to think of them.
All this did not seem so out of
place in England, where still the
land is dotted with Mediaeval
ruins, and people are still employed
to keep fresh the blood-stains of
many who were beheaded by a Me
diaeval faith. But in America,
where poverty forbade the main
taining the full livery of all this,
the incongruity was very striking.

The more intense intellectual
life grown up outside of the uni
versities created a wider demand
fora preparation to live it. Nat
urally the universities were sought
to gratify this demand. But this
old regime did not satisfy those
who looked forward to a career not
within the lines of theology and
philosophy. Some inkling at least
of those great conquests in the
realms of nature were begged for in
the short intervals in Latin prose
in grinding out Latin verses. Thus
science came in first as a sort of in
dulgence. She occupied the nooks
and corners. She appeared only
in the mild form of lectures on the
most conspicuous and interesting
phenomena of nature. It was not
imagined (hat it did or could con
tribute to the training and culture
which it was the peculiar func
tion of the university to give.
Hut these beginnings were the com
mencement of and awakening of a
new university life. It was the
opening of a cleft in the walls, al
lowing a beam of the light of day
unclouded by smoke of incense, not
distorted by stained glass, to pene
trate into the great structure.
The mere statement of the con
quests that had been made over
nature carried with it the evi
dence of the great progress of the
world outside and beyond the uni
versity. It showed that already
knowledge and life had become so
vast and so intense that the old
routine could not serve for it.
With a few of the meager facts of
science first introduced came next
into the university the methods of
science. Then appeared the lal(or
atories as a means of education.
This made the connection between
the university and the rest of the
world. In the laboratories real
and tangible facts and the inquir
ing mind were in the university
brought face to face, and the true
method of the solution of the one
by the other demonstrated. This
touch of reality brought about a
series of results in higher education
which are revolutionizingand must
continue to revolutionize our con
ceptions of its aim and content.
The real universe is vastly greater
and more magnificent than any
imagined one. The innermost re
cess of our nature vibrates to real
contact with the actual universe.
It is a partand product of it. It grew
by the means of the external uni
verse, and is still to grow by that
means.
Those in the University who felt
the tonic of a breath of a real at
mosphere soon demanded reality in
other knowledge than that of na
ture. The student after seeing and
trying the careful method of the
scientist who patiently and with
great labor and with every guard
against prejudice gathered a great
number of facts, and looked to
these and these alone for his con
clusions, and when these con
clusions thus produced seemed
somewhat real, could no longer
with patience listen to an historical
discourse which was the work of
imagination, an announcement of
the most profound and far-reaching
conclusions in economic science
which had their source only in
principles assumed in the begin
ning by the author, or a course in
the science of the mind which did
not deal with ascertained real facts
of the mind; and least of all could
he listen with patience to the ex
pounding of a system of philosophy
which assumed to comprehend all
sciences and correlate them with
out a knowledge of a single one of
them.
The student from the laboratory
who has felt its meaning and
caught its spirit knows that all
these things are thin air thrown
into vibrations, and that the same
air might as well have vibrated in
any other combination. Conse
quently he demands the same sort
of knowledge and the same cer
tainty in it in other lines of study.
He who has felt the keen pleasure
and satisfaction of a quantitative
determination of a piece of knowl
edge can not but look with some
thing of contempt on mere opinion
and effusive statement.
It is these demands that have
shaken up many oi the old subjects
and the old methods. Another ex
tremely important effect has been
the introduction and strengthening
of other lines of study not gener
ally classed as scientific which
were practically outside the system
of education; that is, the group
known as the humanities, subjects
which are often wrongly assumed
as opposed to the sciences.
While the teaching of Plato that
separated mind from matter still
influences largely the thought of
our time, yet the time is fast ap
proaching when all lines of sep
aration will disappear, and man in
all his phases will be considered
and treated as a part of nature.
There is now every day wider ex
tension of the demand of real
knowledge in regard to all things
pertaining to man. This is the di
rect result of this taste for reality
that the scientific spirit has begot
ten. In consequence there are now
in the universities side by side with
the sciences the great studies his
tory, economics, literature, and art.
These with the sciences were almost
unknown in the higher schools in
their true sense fifty years ago in
this country and in England.
Science has also discovered, dig
nified, and given a deeper meaning
to still other phases of human ac
tivity. The mechanical and in
dustrial arts have felt in the most
wonderful manner its creative in
fluence, and to this they owe the
positions they are coming to take
among the results of productive
thinking. The prejudice bred by
the long use of a narrow definition
of culture kept these subjects out of
the educational courses, hut it is
beginning to be realized that it
may be as much worth while to
understand the making of the com
plex and finished products of the
present age as it is to contemplate
the rude implements of a past one.
Today still, in the courses in the
elementary and secondary schools,
the most conservative and Plato
ridden institutions that remain to
us, there is given a meager place to
the knowledge of man and of na
ture; that is, the sciences, history,
literature, and art. But the time
is at hand when that self-sufficient
philosophy which so largely domi
nates the thought in our lower
schools must succumb to the move
ments of the times. Then the
children and youth, through the
very periods of growth and develop
ment, when they can best catch the
spirit and form the habits of the
advanced age in which they live,
instead of being systematically
hedged in from all contact with it,
will be intelligently induced into
its spirit, made familiar with
its product and drilled in its
methods. When they leave the
schools they will be immediately at
home in the world about them, and
can successfully face it.
Theologians, Hegelians, and Pla
tonists of whatever twist have
cause to fear the scientific method;
but least of all should the student
of the humanities make faces at

the scientist, and become emo
tional, not to say hysterical, at the
scientific method, as was recently
the case with an earnest student
history. There is, of course, an op
portunity sometimes for ilie his
torian to be moved with the spirit
of the antiquarian, and as becomes
upon some of the admirable fig
ures that have crossed the stage in
the past, to bemoan the times that
no longer produce in exact detail
these tine old characters.
The dignified scholar, the fine
old gentleman glowing with the
culture of the old school, awakens
our enthusiastic admiration, and
even love, as we unearth him from
the times in which he lived; still
we need not mourn that no one
now who is strong enough to be
come such a one is willing to do
so, any more than he would desire
to wear a queue, three-cornered
hat and shoe buckles and hunt
ducks with a blunderbuss. Then
we may console ourselves with the
recollection of the many other things
which of necessity were contem
poraneous with this fine old gen
tleman, and happily have passed
awav with him.
How inane in any ease are these
wails against science and the
scientific method and the changes
they are working out. The scien
tific method is so constructed that
it can overturn nothing but error,
and if one's investments do not lie
in that direction why worry any
longer about it?
The plea that science unfits one
for the enjoyment of that side of
nature and life which it is the
office of art and literature to ex
press is an equally shallow one.
How can knowing the truth more
deeply, cause us to see less of beauty,
or to have less of feeling in all
that appeals to us?
While we may be wrapt in ad
miration at the grandeur of a mount
ain, and watch with awe the effect
of changing tint and color of
mountain, skv, and darkening val
ley, as the painting of a setting
sun carries them all through a
most wonderful program, our emo
tions will be none the less or ex
pansion of soul le>s great if we
also see that mountain a monu
ment erected as the resultant of
great forces that have through ages
been at work on its structure and
form. Science does not prevent
our seeing the beauty of the scene,
but lends vastly to Ihe effect by
making it, instead of a momentary
display of color with no more mean
ing than we can conjure up, a veri
table height from which we get a
glimpse of the real living universe
greater than any imagined one. So
with every bird, flower, or gem, and
every phenomenon of nature.
Science does not do away with
beauty of form or color or grace of
motion, but gives to all these a
deeper meaning. It may be true
that scientists do not usually rave
about these things, and do not par
ticularly enjoy the ravings of
others. They have passed the rav
ing period, and have reached that
of deep self-sacrificing devotion.
All such talk as abusing Newton
for the "analysis of the rainbow,"
or shuddering because "science
teaches the youth to analyze his
mother's tears," and the like, are
either hysterical or sensational.
The same quantitative study and
rigid application of the method of
science must give ;i deeper meaning
to the facts within the realm of the
study of man; nor can it lessen
feeling in regard to him. It will
surely often change .»ur point of
view and change our conceptions of
the value of things. The scientific

method is not going to deprive us
<>112 the power of crying, but will
clear up things so that we can cry
over the right things—in other
words, cry more intelligently.
The scientific method has been
correctly described as the method
of "common sense." And to say
as was recently said in a promi
nent address, "'beware of the scien
tific method" in studies of history,
is to decry the extension of com
mon sense into these regions.
The new evils of which we are
hearing so much as the result of
science arise rather from those who
have taken up the name and some
what of the language of science,
and not its real method and spirit.
In all times there have been those
who, seeking to gain somewhat
of prominence and authority for
what they have to say or do, have
posed as members of a strong or
popular party. Science has become
popular and much respected, con
sequently there have come to at
tempt to enroll with her votaries
great motley crowds of those who
write and speak, who catch up
some of her language, take on
something of her air, and with
them promulgate as her teachings
all the various vagaries that the
human mind is heir to. There re
sults in this time of change and
lack of scientific education much
confusion and distrust of science.
Th s is increased l»y still another
group of quite a different stamp.
They are honest and earnest and in
their work wish to use, indeed
think tliey are using, the scientific
method; but unfortunately for all
concerned they have no true con
ception of it, nor have they ever
rationally attempted to gain such a
conception. These people would not
think of attempting to calculate an
eclipse or build a steam-engine
without the years of preparation
for such work, but do not hesitate
to attempt far more difficult prob
lems which only the scientific
method 'will solve, without any
preparation for the work.
But evils and confusion arising
from these causes will right them
selves in time, for the tests are so
(dear that those who know how to
employ them may with reason
able certainty distinguish the'
true method from its imitation,
and the number of such good
judges is rapidly increasing.
The warning then should be
not to heware of the scientific
method, but to beware of attempt
ing to proceed in any direction
without its being most rigorously
applied. And while it is true that
the scientific method applied to the
study of chemistry and physics
"'has not made history a whit easier
to understai d," the application of
the scientific method to history has
already begun to unravel some of
its problems, and it seems sure
nothing else will accomplish this.
While it is too much to expect
that the habits of thought that
have dominated for two centuries
will pass promptly and without
many sorrows, yet tliey are passing
as the unprofitable must pass.
The scientific method does not
promise panaceas, hut it insures a
healthy life by showing that they
do not exist. As we see things
now the scientific method can do
all that can be done, and that
seems to be the conclusion of the
whole matter.
While viewing with great pleas
ure the service that science has
done higher education, we can not
escape the fact that the scientific
spirit has suffered somewhat by its
contact with the university. When
science was conquering the world,

it was living its heroic age. Its
followers were true heroes. Devo
tion, love, self-sacrifice, and courage,
without hope of any reward from
the world outside, constituted their
life. Their motives were of the
purest and loftiest. With the suc
cess of science there have come
other conditions, and now there
are also other motives for the pur
suit of science. In the universities
the science subjects have been com
pelled more or less to conform to
the routine already existing in
them. The subjects in the uni
versities form parts of formal
courses, which are <>112 more or less
artificial groups. These lead to de
grees and other distinctions. Thus
motives are created for the study
of science which are entirely for
eign to the spirit and content of
any science. Indeed the rivalry of
schools has become such that many
forms of bait have been resorted to
in order to lure people on to fur
ther study in the university courses,
such as prizes, degrees, scholar
ships, fellowships, and distinctions
of various kinds. Thus there come
to be mingled together with those
who study science for its own sake
many who pursue it for some ul
terior motive. This has brought
out a host of unscrupulous little in
tellects who in the various de
partments of science are boring in
every conceivable direction and are
describing with the most tiresome
details their minutest chips, and
often with it wasting good money
in expensive lithographs. Their
products are becoming so numerous
and intermingled with real works
that it requires great labor to sift
them out. But this is not the
greatest harm. The most serious
evil is the robbing the true spirit
of science of the power it posessess
when it alone is the motive.
What will be the final outcome?
Will science, which has already
done so much to make rational
the university courses, which has
pierced so many bubbles and cor
roded so many baubles, be able
finally to make all conventional
trivialities of the university disap
pear? Already a large number of
those who enter the universities do
so for the preparation for work they
have in mind. To such the arti
ficial stimuli count for nothing.
May we not hope for the time when
it will be seen that the university
does a great harm in proposing
either directly or indirectly any
other motive than those its sub
jects carry with them? Should the
university encourage in its students
such an absurd class of questions
as "How much chemistry or his
tory shall I take to get one degree,
and how much add to this to get
another?"
And then when one has increased
in knowledge or grown in spirit
why should he wish a certificate t >
that effect or receive a distinguish
ing mark? Most curious of all is
the millinery method of desig
nating stages of intellectual de
velopment. For example, a cer
tain development of soul, shown by
a hood with a yellow border; cap
carrying a rectangular figure on
top probably indicates the mind
having reached two dimensions;
a certain refinement of spirit, indi
cated by sleeves of gown neatly
edged with gold braid; certain very
lofty aspirations realized, collar
turned up, gown long, cut bias and
gored with black darts of velvet; a
combination of ail those grand
motherly qualities that allows one
to preside over this gentle throne,
and thus be a true alma mater,
gown very full with plenty of
white lace. Now it is thought vul
gar for one to display his material
wealth, or for an Indian to boast
of heinga big one. Can one with
any greater propriety assume a halo
because he has learned a certain
group of things?
The systems of education which
we have, both elementary and
higher, are in great part an in
heritance from times long preced
ing our own. Whether they were
suited to those times and what were
the reasons for their forms is of
little consequence to us now as far
as the organization of a system for
our own times is concerned. Hut
as a matter of fact it is made of
great consequence from the un
reasoning fear and distaste to
changing what has once been in
such matters. We have here too
much reverence for the past, sim
ply from the halo that the past
often gives things, incongruous as
they may have been when they
existed. Indeed the fact thai any
system belonged to the past, should
in itself lead us to suspect it, as it
was adapted to times that, from the
nature of things, could not be like
our own. From their hallowed as
sociations, to attempt to use the
wooden plough that the Romans
used, to plough the great ranches of
California would not only be an
example of maudlin sentimentality,
but would reduce California to the
condition in which it was when it
was formerly under control of a
Latin civilization. The wooden
plough and its contemporary ideas
may properly find a place in the
museum of a university, butshould
not form any part of its working
organization.
Nor should the conception that
the educational system is the result
of an evolution be made the ex
cuse for retaining useless parts
that have come to us from the past
as sort of rudimentary organs to
remind us of its origin. The laws
of organic growth and heredity do
not hold here. Hut as the builder
of a steamship is free to ignore all
the steps in the evolution of the
parts of a modern vessel, and
choose the best material and latest
devices that mechanical engineering
has to offer, so in our educational
system there is nothing in its na
ture to prevent our making it what
we please.
When we come to consider the
vastness of well-ordered real knowl-i
edge at the present time, the in-1
tensity of intellectual activity, the
great number of important prob
lems thrust upon us, the crowds of
errors as well as the multitudes of
truths that crowd upon our judg-i
ment, and the tierce competition on
every hand, requiring the best
equipment in modern knowledge
and method, there is the most ur
gent reason that our educational
system be cleared of everything
that interferes with its cleanest ac
tion.
The elementary system needs no
longer the endless patching up of
its motley mixture, the strange re
sult of necessity, empiricism, and
accident. It has had enough of
the fanciful apologies of the phi
losophers for its existence, and of
mystic pictures of its fancied rela
tions to an imagined soul. It
needs to be completely reorganized
from the foundation and put in
relation to the life of today.
As for our higher schools, the
universities, they have become
freer to react to the times. They
are every year becoming less under
the influence of the inane and in
active scholasticism which made

the most narrow of definitions of
culture and set her up as a goddess
and established about her a puerile
ritual and a most bigoted hierarchy.
First in Germany and then in
America the university broke away,
or is breaking away from these
bonils.
The university is no longer to be
simply the conservator of the past.
It should be the leader and stimu
lus of the present and the prophet
of the future. Every phase of in
tellectual activity should have its
place in the university, where will
he gathered its literature, where
may be collected its facts, and
where will be grouped masters in
its science who stand ready to im
part its spirit and drill in its
methods. Throughout the whole
will prevail thoroughly the scien
tific spirit and method, and that
complete freedom in choice of sub
jects and career absolutely neces
sary to strongest development.
Our own university in America
most nearly approaches in spirit
such nn ideal, and if such a life
here is not universal it is at least,
possible to all, and many there be
who live with enthusiasm up to this
possibility. 1 congratulate you
that during your eduoational career
you have had the possibility of
breathing with freedom something
of the spirit of the times. May
you that go and you that remain
vividly appreciate this too rare a
privilege, and cultivate and guard
most jealously this spirit. May it
become an instinct with us. May
we be quick to resent and ever ar
dent to oppose any taint of the old
regime which may seek admission
among us, and thus threaten our
freedom and undermine our intel
lectual manhood.
The stupendous changes that
have been wrought in the material
life of the civilized races in a short
period of time by the progress of
modern science have been generally
recognized. We have to make only a
casual investigation into the history
of the production of the things that
would come under our view at our
first turn, to find complete revolu
tion in production, manufacture,
and distribution. We find further
that it is not in each a single change,
but revolution on revolution the
most radical. For example, in le*s
than twenty-live years the immense
and complicated bus.ness of transit
in our cities has passed from omni
bus to horse car, from horse car to the
cable system, from the cable system
to the electric car system, with
special variations in the way of ele
vated railroads and pneumatic rail
ways. Methods of lighting, heat
ing, production and transference of
power for motors, have passed
through equal strides of change and
improvement. Everything con
nected with the immense business
of t transportation, from the great un
dertaking of bridge building and
steamship structures down to the
sealing of a freight car or the exca
vation of a yard of rock, has in a
like period passed through radical
revolutions that are bewildering in
their rapidity and in the greatness
of the interests involved.
This change and this advance
have appeared not alone in these
large and conspicuous phenomena
of activity, but in the countless
other lines of human industry
change has followed change. Im
provement and advance on what
lias been just past have been the
constant movement of the time.
On account of the complex relations
that exist in a community, a single
new invention may greatly affect
many occupations other than the
one in which the invention is used.
Consequently as matters are now
going, it is beyond mental grasp to
comprehend the breadth and depth
of these changes. As the result of
them hosts of old occupations have
been destroyed, innumerable ones
have been completely and radically
revolutionized, and hosts of new ones
have been created. This has made
a wholesale destruction of old rela
tions and a wholesale creation of
new ones. And with all this have
come and still must come the most
severe strains on the structure of the
community in the readjustment of
these relations.
This condition of the present time
appears more striking when we con
sider that more and greater changes
have occurred in the material life
of thecommunity and the adjust
ments these have brought with
them in the last ten years than have
occurred in any thousand years pre
vious to the ninteenth century.
It is agreed on all hands that all
these marvels of change and im
provement in the setting of our ma
terial life have been the result of
the application of the scientific
method to t he study of nature. Kven
those who suspect science and decry
the scientific method and warn the
elect against both, acknowledge the
service that science has done for

what tliey style the material man.
They, as promptly as others, de
mand of the hotels, railroads, ar
chitects, and publishing houses that
they take advantage in every way
of the latest that science has to
offer. We have no longer, then,
to contend for what science has ac
complished for this side of human
life.
These marvels are of profound
interest and with an outcome im
possible to foresee; but interesting
and significant as these results of
science are, it is still another phase
of the effect of the modern scien
tific method that shall detain us at
ibis moment. Too large it is and
too comprehensive —too far-reach
ing to be brought to more than
mere notice in so short a time. It
is the effect of science on the
thought of the time, and more spe
cifically its effect on higher educa
tion and the university.
The expression, ''The thought of
the time," as generally made use
of, is not accurately descriptive.
Strictly speaking, the thought of
any time has its manifold expres-

sion in Jill thiit, the people of the
time do or produce, whether it he
in the form of manufacture, works
of art, customs, institutions, or the
varied forms of written expression
that have come from them. Hut
the expression is more usually lim
ited to those more formal products
of mental activity represented hy
its literature, systems of philoso
phy, and formal sciences.
The enumeration of the triumphs
of science frequently includes only
the list of remarkable appliances
for bettering our material life. Hut
the scientific method has also be
gun to affect most profoundly the
other side of human life. It
is revolutionizing the methods of
thought in all phases of mental ac-
The progress here has been more
slow, uncertain, and unsuccessful.
Men are more ready to change the
appliances of a new home, the
methods of travel and communica
tion, and even their methods of
thinking in business relations and
active life, than the}' are to change

in all those matters not immediately
connected with material life in which
there is a fierce and definite compe
tition. But a brief examination
will show the profound influence of
this method.
Turning back to the most pros
perous age of Greece, we find the
Greeks sympathetic lovers of na
ture, as their life and art have
shown. They were students, too,
of nature, groping not wholly
blindly, as demonstrated by many
of their conceptions that have
passed down to us. There arose
among them Socrates and Plato —
the teacher, and his literary exec
utor and expounder. With the
purest and best of motives they un
consciously did the race a disser
vice that became a bar to progress
for the ages that followed. They
sought fundamental truths with the
commendable purpose of settlingall
questions of ethics for all time.
If the universe is the product of
fundamental principles, the long
ages of succession of events, with
their differentiation, synthesis, and
evolution, have complicated matters

immensely and buried fundamental
principles so deep that it is impossi
ble to discover them, in the external
universe. Consequently, not quickly
finding their required principles
and definitions in this external uni
verse of nature, and without un
derstanding why the universe could
not furnish them, they turned their
inquiries within. And the mind is
so constituted that it can make any
hypotheses and then proceed to
build a system logically based on
them. Hence they had no trouble
to obtain the definitions required.
These were of ihe mind alone.
Then to defend and hold these it
was necessary to do away with the
rest of the universe. So from that
time on, mind was the universe;
mind and matter had nothing in
common. Nature was to be over
looked, despised, and shunned as
gross, corrupting matter, and only
flights of mind were real and worth
any serious consideration.
This whole legitimate outcome
did not immediately follow on the
innocent diversions of Plato. It

whs not until after Aristotle—whose
genius won him a place of go large
authority—had taken up these
phases of thinking and put them
in form to he used that they came
to exert so extensive and powerful
an influence. Aristotle was him
self in a way a student of nature of
great promise. But to his large
line of successors, hardly followers,
the mental flights were more at
tractive than his bugs and fishes.
So the world went into the occupa
tion of what has been stvled "pure
thinking"; that is, thinking not con
ditioned by the presence of any fact
of the gross universe.
Then arose one after another the
so-called great thinkers, men who
solved all things by introspection
and contemplation. Then the sys
tems of philosophy spread over
Western Europe like cobwebs over
a lawn of a summer morning. The
early writers of the Christian
Church, tlie Christian fathers, also
wove a tissue of theology by the
methods and with the inspiration
of Plato. And thus the warp and
woof of the intellectual life of ages
consist of what has been styled
the "lazy philosophy of Plato."
The church, the state, and the
schools, literature and art, were
dominated by the methods which
seek fundamental principles by in
trospection and on them build each
its peculiar structure, by the con
ception that the mind of man was
the center and content of the uni
verse, and all else was either gross
or unreal. Investigation and col
lection of facts were not only un
necessary, but they all belonged to
that netherworld which could only
serve the purpose of interfering
with the lofty movement of pure
thought.
Through all this long period of
pure thinking no contribution of
value to progress can be pointed out.
At long intervals protests appeared
against the extreme conditions
brought on by these methods.
These protests culminated in the
Renaissance and the Reformation.
These movements were the express
ion of the true instinctive love of
man for nature and the real. They
brought new life again into the
world, but their leaders could never
shake themselves clear of the very
methods whose results they opposed.
It was with them the instinct to
return to the true position without
the training to maintain it. Con
sequently their movements, re
freshing as showers after a long
drought, produced no far-reaching
radical changes and but slow and
diversified progress. They were
rather a rush to the enjoyment
of nature once more, and not a
serious study of her, while the
methods of thinking were little
changed.
Thus matters stood until the be
ginning of the present century; and
with this immense past and the
slavish reverence for the past these
conceptions and methods, like the
"Old Man of the Sea," still hang
upon the neck of the present move
ment. Hut as this lusty giant grows,
the "Old Man's" days are num
bered.
All through the darkest of this
unproductive period, real students
of nature, scattered here and there,
more or less stifled by the attno

sphere of the times, kept alive,
smouldering and almost extin
guished as it often was, coals of the
true lire which was to blaze out in
such a conflagration as we are now
witnessing, from which is to come a
new and more glorious world.
Before the beginning of the pres
ent century the number of students
of nature was steadily increasing.
The feeling was growing, and indeed
was sometimes expressed by them,
that no thinking or conclusion is
warranted except that based on
facts —facts became of extreme
importance; and no end of labor
and pains was spent to obtain
them. They again and again re
paid all this labor by yielding the
most wonderful discoveries, famil
iar to all acquainted with the his
tory of science.
Thus slowly and surely grew into
tangible shape what we know as the
scientific method —a method which
has been described by Huxley as the
"method of common sense," a
method which simply demands an
accurate knowledge of the facts be
fore describing their relations.
Its value plainly demonstrated
and once clearly conceived, it has
become the plain and simple instru
ment that has made these magnifi
cent conquests in the world of our
material life; and now we have the
spectacle of its vigorous effect on
the matters and methods of those
things usually designated as of the
mind.
We have but to pass in rapid re
view the state of the knowledge of
today and that of recent years to
obtain our evidence.
All of the old nature subjects,
physical and biological, have been
completely revolutionized. Within
them whole groups of elaborate sci
ences have been created, and all of
these have progressed with remark
able rapidity. All those subjects not
classed with the nature subjects
have also felt the influence of the
creative power of the scientific
method, for within the bounds of the
humanities this breath of life is
transforming everything and bring
ing into birth the healthy begin
nings of many sciences.
The immeasurable success at
tained in a short period of years in
the study of nature by the scientific
method, contrasted with the abso
lute lack of progress which was the
result of othef methods, forced it
self on the attention of those really
seeking truth in other lines of
thought. As a consequence students
of history, of social institutions and
problems, of language, of mental
phenomena, and even of ethics and
philosophy, to a greater or less ex
tent have introduced the scientific
method into their work.
A comparison of the state of each
of these lines of human thought of
today with that of fifty years ago
shows astonishing changes.
To illustrate: As we have exem
plified so well among us here, his
tory is no loner merely the more or
less interesting accounts of the con
spicuous persons and events of a
nation's life, based on facts not ac
curately obtained, colored bv the
prejudices or literary ambition of
those describing them; often, it is
true, it is unified into a semblance
of completeness by constructing the
whole on a plan—a plan, however,
which is the result of an attempt to
illustrate principles which have
been preconceived by the author.
Indeed the history of the past is
chiefly the works of authors.
The history of the present is quite
a different matter. The history of
the past is to the historical science
of the present what the interesting
stories of dogs, elephants, and curi

ous plants are to that complex of
sciences which has for its object the
explanation of the laws by which all
living beings have come in their
manifold forms to be occupying
their diverse positions and main
taining their overwhelming and
complex relations with one another
and all the world beside.
In like manner, history at the
present time is a vigorous science.
It proposes to solve a thousand
problems of the development of the
life of the human race. Its ma
terial is of that broad extent that it
includes every fact and every act of
all peoples of all times. It views
the earth covered with diversified
peoples of different languages, cus
toms, institutions, occupations, and
beliefs. It sees these as innumer
able differentiations of original com
mon antecedents. It proposes to
ascertain as far as possible the facts
of the progress of this differentia
tion and development, and from
these facts discover the laws that
have wrought so many diverse
forms of community life, so many
forms of thought and activity.
The problems are vast. The ma
terial of the past too scant by far, it
is true, still the scientific method of
research is multiplying the mater
ial immensely. And the great re
spect that the scientific spirit has
engendered has driven the present
to begin to make most extensive re
cords of its acts, so that the future
historian will not lack for data.
His labors will even be greater and
more slow, but they will give real
products.
Not all students and workers in
history have fully caught the scien
tific spirit nor have comprehended
the vastness and grandeur of the
work that the method of science
has demonstrated possible for them.
History is still to them the source of
themes for the production of litera
ture, instead of being a magnificent
structure to whose building they
will contribute. Thus the lines be
tween history and biology are dis
appearing, and history lias become
thoroughly a natural science with
the most complex of all problems,
demanding the most rigid methods.
The scientific spirit has not changed
the writer of history alone but lias
also affected his audience. We are
no longer satisfied with the aul lior's
emotions in respect to Caesar's cros
sing the Rubicon, or Washington's
crossing the Deleware. We wish
from liini a certified picture of the
scene and an accurate determina
tion of its place in the movement
of which it is a pari; and we will
furnish our own emotions.
The social sciences have been also
greatly affected by the example of
these scientific methods, although
they are still largely in the hands
of the theorists. There are arising
among its students those who have
a deej) and earnest desire to come
face to face with the real facts of so
cial life and their relations and laws
of development. They are recogniz
ing that these problems are of the
most difficult and complex nature
and above all require accu
rate quantitative determination.
Theories in regard to products and
their distribution in regard to busi
ness and legislation, do hot with
them precede the knowledge of the
real facts of these great occupations.
They will show how such facts as
the invention of a process of
making steel has affected transpor
tation, distribution, and business
and other relations more than have
works on the principles of political
economy. May their tribe increase!
In the region of the study of lan
guage the scientific method has
given us within the space of a com

paratively few years the great and
important science of philology,
with its many departments —the
first successful attempt at a rational
view of language in all the long
period of language study. The im
petus thus given to active and vig
orous research in a domain of knowl
edge that had become dead and
profitless in the extreme, is in itself
sufficient proof of the value of this
method. Time does not permit the
account of how one after another
the other fields of intellectual activ
ity have come or are corning to feel
the tonic influence of science. It
would be interesting to know what
is to become of philosophy. But as
indications point, the forecast would
bean ungrateful task. Two or three
tlr.ngs must happen. She must
give up that solemn bluff that the
philosopher knows more of each
science than any of the specialists
in the sciences know. She must
give up her function of being the
science of all sciences. The philoso
pher who would attempt to corre
late all the sciences of today might
as well singly and alone attempt to
digest all the agricultural products
of America in a single year.
Science, its method and its pro
ducts having furnished the envir
onment of our life, having opened
up to us vast fields of knowledge
and thus having permeated every
form of literature, and having
demonstrated the only successful
method thus far hit upon for ascer
taining truth, and thus having com
pelled change in the general
methods of thought —in short, hav
ing created a new heaven and a
new earth —it was but a natural
demand that it should forma part
of the educational system, which
might reasonably be supposed to
prepare for living in this new uni
verse.
At least in England and America
nothing has been more conservative
than t he system of education. The
schools for higher education in
hardly any manner reflected the
vital knowledge and the actual dis
cussions of the times in which they
existed. Their aitnsasfar as they can
be ascertained were such that they
had no need to deal with any form
of real and useful knowledge. It
was claimed that they were to give
training and culture. The training
was mainly of a few specific forms
of memory and feats of mental
legerdemain, but the culture was
undeniable unmistakable, very
unctuous, and glowed with a soft
light. Its possessor was known as
a scholar.
The subjects used for this train
ing had become traditional and
were for the most part conven
tional. These studies were in no
way in touch with the active world
outside. The occupations and meth
ods of thought were precisely of
that nature to make members of
this community despise all mate
rial facts and shun all contact
with material objects.
This isolated and narrow life cre
ated a community peculiar to itself
and jealous of its peculiarities.
They created for themselves an ex
clusive caste, the members worship
ing one another and despising all
the world beside, and in turn
mildly despised by the world when
it happened to think of them.
All this did not seem so out of
place in England, where still the
land is dotted with Mediaeval
ruins, and people are still employed
to keep fresh the blood-stains of
many who were beheaded by a Me
diaeval faith. But in America,
where poverty forbade the main
taining the full livery of all this,
the incongruity was very striking.

The more intense intellectual
life grown up outside of the uni
versities created a wider demand
fora preparation to live it. Nat
urally the universities were sought
to gratify this demand. But this
old regime did not satisfy those
who looked forward to a career not
within the lines of theology and
philosophy. Some inkling at least
of those great conquests in the
realms of nature were begged for in
the short intervals in Latin prose
in grinding out Latin verses. Thus
science came in first as a sort of in
dulgence. She occupied the nooks
and corners. She appeared only
in the mild form of lectures on the
most conspicuous and interesting
phenomena of nature. It was not
imagined (hat it did or could con
tribute to the training and culture
which it was the peculiar func
tion of the university to give.
Hut these beginnings were the com
mencement of and awakening of a
new university life. It was the
opening of a cleft in the walls, al
lowing a beam of the light of day
unclouded by smoke of incense, not
distorted by stained glass, to pene
trate into the great structure.
The mere statement of the con
quests that had been made over
nature carried with it the evi
dence of the great progress of the
world outside and beyond the uni
versity. It showed that already
knowledge and life had become so
vast and so intense that the old
routine could not serve for it.
With a few of the meager facts of
science first introduced came next
into the university the methods of
science. Then appeared the lal(or
atories as a means of education.
This made the connection between
the university and the rest of the
world. In the laboratories real
and tangible facts and the inquir
ing mind were in the university
brought face to face, and the true
method of the solution of the one
by the other demonstrated. This
touch of reality brought about a
series of results in higher education
which are revolutionizingand must
continue to revolutionize our con
ceptions of its aim and content.
The real universe is vastly greater
and more magnificent than any
imagined one. The innermost re
cess of our nature vibrates to real
contact with the actual universe.
It is a partand product of it. It grew
by the means of the external uni
verse, and is still to grow by that
means.
Those in the University who felt
the tonic of a breath of a real at
mosphere soon demanded reality in
other knowledge than that of na
ture. The student after seeing and
trying the careful method of the
scientist who patiently and with
great labor and with every guard
against prejudice gathered a great
number of facts, and looked to
these and these alone for his con
clusions, and when these con
clusions thus produced seemed
somewhat real, could no longer
with patience listen to an historical
discourse which was the work of
imagination, an announcement of
the most profound and far-reaching
conclusions in economic science
which had their source only in
principles assumed in the begin
ning by the author, or a course in
the science of the mind which did
not deal with ascertained real facts
of the mind; and least of all could
he listen with patience to the ex
pounding of a system of philosophy
which assumed to comprehend all
sciences and correlate them with
out a knowledge of a single one of
them.
The student from the laboratory
who has felt its meaning and
caught its spirit knows that all
these things are thin air thrown
into vibrations, and that the same
air might as well have vibrated in
any other combination. Conse
quently he demands the same sort
of knowledge and the same cer
tainty in it in other lines of study.
He who has felt the keen pleasure
and satisfaction of a quantitative
determination of a piece of knowl
edge can not but look with some
thing of contempt on mere opinion
and effusive statement.
It is these demands that have
shaken up many oi the old subjects
and the old methods. Another ex
tremely important effect has been
the introduction and strengthening
of other lines of study not gener
ally classed as scientific which
were practically outside the system
of education; that is, the group
known as the humanities, subjects
which are often wrongly assumed
as opposed to the sciences.
While the teaching of Plato that
separated mind from matter still
influences largely the thought of
our time, yet the time is fast ap
proaching when all lines of sep
aration will disappear, and man in
all his phases will be considered
and treated as a part of nature.
There is now every day wider ex
tension of the demand of real
knowledge in regard to all things
pertaining to man. This is the di
rect result of this taste for reality
that the scientific spirit has begot
ten. In consequence there are now
in the universities side by side with
the sciences the great studies his
tory, economics, literature, and art.
These with the sciences were almost
unknown in the higher schools in
their true sense fifty years ago in
this country and in England.
Science has also discovered, dig
nified, and given a deeper meaning
to still other phases of human ac
tivity. The mechanical and in
dustrial arts have felt in the most
wonderful manner its creative in
fluence, and to this they owe the
positions they are coming to take
among the results of productive
thinking. The prejudice bred by
the long use of a narrow definition
of culture kept these subjects out of
the educational courses, hut it is
beginning to be realized that it
may be as much worth while to
understand the making of the com
plex and finished products of the
present age as it is to contemplate
the rude implements of a past one.
Today still, in the courses in the
elementary and secondary schools,
the most conservative and Plato
ridden institutions that remain to
us, there is given a meager place to
the knowledge of man and of na
ture; that is, the sciences, history,
literature, and art. But the time
is at hand when that self-sufficient
philosophy which so largely domi
nates the thought in our lower
schools must succumb to the move
ments of the times. Then the
children and youth, through the
very periods of growth and develop
ment, when they can best catch the
spirit and form the habits of the
advanced age in which they live,
instead of being systematically
hedged in from all contact with it,
will be intelligently induced into
its spirit, made familiar with
its product and drilled in its
methods. When they leave the
schools they will be immediately at
home in the world about them, and
can successfully face it.
Theologians, Hegelians, and Pla
tonists of whatever twist have
cause to fear the scientific method;
but least of all should the student
of the humanities make faces at

the scientist, and become emo
tional, not to say hysterical, at the
scientific method, as was recently
the case with an earnest student
history. There is, of course, an op
portunity sometimes for ilie his
torian to be moved with the spirit
of the antiquarian, and as becomes
upon some of the admirable fig
ures that have crossed the stage in
the past, to bemoan the times that
no longer produce in exact detail
these tine old characters.
The dignified scholar, the fine
old gentleman glowing with the
culture of the old school, awakens
our enthusiastic admiration, and
even love, as we unearth him from
the times in which he lived; still
we need not mourn that no one
now who is strong enough to be
come such a one is willing to do
so, any more than he would desire
to wear a queue, three-cornered
hat and shoe buckles and hunt
ducks with a blunderbuss. Then
we may console ourselves with the
recollection of the many other things
which of necessity were contem
poraneous with this fine old gen
tleman, and happily have passed
awav with him.
How inane in any ease are these
wails against science and the
scientific method and the changes
they are working out. The scien
tific method is so constructed that
it can overturn nothing but error,
and if one's investments do not lie
in that direction why worry any
longer about it?
The plea that science unfits one
for the enjoyment of that side of
nature and life which it is the
office of art and literature to ex
press is an equally shallow one.
How can knowing the truth more
deeply, cause us to see less of beauty,
or to have less of feeling in all
that appeals to us?
While we may be wrapt in ad
miration at the grandeur of a mount
ain, and watch with awe the effect
of changing tint and color of
mountain, skv, and darkening val
ley, as the painting of a setting
sun carries them all through a
most wonderful program, our emo
tions will be none the less or ex
pansion of soul le>s great if we
also see that mountain a monu
ment erected as the resultant of
great forces that have through ages
been at work on its structure and
form. Science does not prevent
our seeing the beauty of the scene,
but lends vastly to Ihe effect by
making it, instead of a momentary
display of color with no more mean
ing than we can conjure up, a veri
table height from which we get a
glimpse of the real living universe
greater than any imagined one. So
with every bird, flower, or gem, and
every phenomenon of nature.
Science does not do away with
beauty of form or color or grace of
motion, but gives to all these a
deeper meaning. It may be true
that scientists do not usually rave
about these things, and do not par
ticularly enjoy the ravings of
others. They have passed the rav
ing period, and have reached that
of deep self-sacrificing devotion.
All such talk as abusing Newton
for the "analysis of the rainbow,"
or shuddering because "science
teaches the youth to analyze his
mother's tears," and the like, are
either hysterical or sensational.
The same quantitative study and
rigid application of the method of
science must give ;i deeper meaning
to the facts within the realm of the
study of man; nor can it lessen
feeling in regard to him. It will
surely often change .»ur point of
view and change our conceptions of
the value of things. The scientific

method is not going to deprive us
<>112 the power of crying, but will
clear up things so that we can cry
over the right things—in other
words, cry more intelligently.
The scientific method has been
correctly described as the method
of "common sense." And to say
as was recently said in a promi
nent address, "'beware of the scien
tific method" in studies of history,
is to decry the extension of com
mon sense into these regions.
The new evils of which we are
hearing so much as the result of
science arise rather from those who
have taken up the name and some
what of the language of science,
and not its real method and spirit.
In all times there have been those
who, seeking to gain somewhat
of prominence and authority for
what they have to say or do, have
posed as members of a strong or
popular party. Science has become
popular and much respected, con
sequently there have come to at
tempt to enroll with her votaries
great motley crowds of those who
write and speak, who catch up
some of her language, take on
something of her air, and with
them promulgate as her teachings
all the various vagaries that the
human mind is heir to. There re
sults in this time of change and
lack of scientific education much
confusion and distrust of science.
Th s is increased l»y still another
group of quite a different stamp.
They are honest and earnest and in
their work wish to use, indeed
think tliey are using, the scientific
method; but unfortunately for all
concerned they have no true con
ception of it, nor have they ever
rationally attempted to gain such a
conception. These people would not
think of attempting to calculate an
eclipse or build a steam-engine
without the years of preparation
for such work, but do not hesitate
to attempt far more difficult prob
lems which only the scientific
method 'will solve, without any
preparation for the work.
But evils and confusion arising
from these causes will right them
selves in time, for the tests are so
(dear that those who know how to
employ them may with reason
able certainty distinguish the'
true method from its imitation,
and the number of such good
judges is rapidly increasing.
The warning then should be
not to heware of the scientific
method, but to beware of attempt
ing to proceed in any direction
without its being most rigorously
applied. And while it is true that
the scientific method applied to the
study of chemistry and physics
"'has not made history a whit easier
to understai d," the application of
the scientific method to history has
already begun to unravel some of
its problems, and it seems sure
nothing else will accomplish this.
While it is too much to expect
that the habits of thought that
have dominated for two centuries
will pass promptly and without
many sorrows, yet tliey are passing
as the unprofitable must pass.
The scientific method does not
promise panaceas, hut it insures a
healthy life by showing that they
do not exist. As we see things
now the scientific method can do
all that can be done, and that
seems to be the conclusion of the
whole matter.
While viewing with great pleas
ure the service that science has
done higher education, we can not
escape the fact that the scientific
spirit has suffered somewhat by its
contact with the university. When
science was conquering the world,

it was living its heroic age. Its
followers were true heroes. Devo
tion, love, self-sacrifice, and courage,
without hope of any reward from
the world outside, constituted their
life. Their motives were of the
purest and loftiest. With the suc
cess of science there have come
other conditions, and now there
are also other motives for the pur
suit of science. In the universities
the science subjects have been com
pelled more or less to conform to
the routine already existing in
them. The subjects in the uni
versities form parts of formal
courses, which are <>112 more or less
artificial groups. These lead to de
grees and other distinctions. Thus
motives are created for the study
of science which are entirely for
eign to the spirit and content of
any science. Indeed the rivalry of
schools has become such that many
forms of bait have been resorted to
in order to lure people on to fur
ther study in the university courses,
such as prizes, degrees, scholar
ships, fellowships, and distinctions
of various kinds. Thus there come
to be mingled together with those
who study science for its own sake
many who pursue it for some ul
terior motive. This has brought
out a host of unscrupulous little in
tellects who in the various de
partments of science are boring in
every conceivable direction and are
describing with the most tiresome
details their minutest chips, and
often with it wasting good money
in expensive lithographs. Their
products are becoming so numerous
and intermingled with real works
that it requires great labor to sift
them out. But this is not the
greatest harm. The most serious
evil is the robbing the true spirit
of science of the power it posessess
when it alone is the motive.
What will be the final outcome?
Will science, which has already
done so much to make rational
the university courses, which has
pierced so many bubbles and cor
roded so many baubles, be able
finally to make all conventional
trivialities of the university disap
pear? Already a large number of
those who enter the universities do
so for the preparation for work they
have in mind. To such the arti
ficial stimuli count for nothing.
May we not hope for the time when
it will be seen that the university
does a great harm in proposing
either directly or indirectly any
other motive than those its sub
jects carry with them? Should the
university encourage in its students
such an absurd class of questions
as "How much chemistry or his
tory shall I take to get one degree,
and how much add to this to get
another?"
And then when one has increased
in knowledge or grown in spirit
why should he wish a certificate t >
that effect or receive a distinguish
ing mark? Most curious of all is
the millinery method of desig
nating stages of intellectual de
velopment. For example, a cer
tain development of soul, shown by
a hood with a yellow border; cap
carrying a rectangular figure on
top probably indicates the mind
having reached two dimensions;
a certain refinement of spirit, indi
cated by sleeves of gown neatly
edged with gold braid; certain very
lofty aspirations realized, collar
turned up, gown long, cut bias and
gored with black darts of velvet; a
combination of ail those grand
motherly qualities that allows one
to preside over this gentle throne,
and thus be a true alma mater,
gown very full with plenty of
white lace. Now it is thought vul
gar for one to display his material
wealth, or for an Indian to boast
of heinga big one. Can one with
any greater propriety assume a halo
because he has learned a certain
group of things?
The systems of education which
we have, both elementary and
higher, are in great part an in
heritance from times long preced
ing our own. Whether they were
suited to those times and what were
the reasons for their forms is of
little consequence to us now as far
as the organization of a system for
our own times is concerned. Hut
as a matter of fact it is made of
great consequence from the un
reasoning fear and distaste to
changing what has once been in
such matters. We have here too
much reverence for the past, sim
ply from the halo that the past
often gives things, incongruous as
they may have been when they
existed. Indeed the fact thai any
system belonged to the past, should
in itself lead us to suspect it, as it
was adapted to times that, from the
nature of things, could not be like
our own. From their hallowed as
sociations, to attempt to use the
wooden plough that the Romans
used, to plough the great ranches of
California would not only be an
example of maudlin sentimentality,
but would reduce California to the
condition in which it was when it
was formerly under control of a
Latin civilization. The wooden
plough and its contemporary ideas
may properly find a place in the
museum of a university, butshould
not form any part of its working
organization.
Nor should the conception that
the educational system is the result
of an evolution be made the ex
cuse for retaining useless parts
that have come to us from the past
as sort of rudimentary organs to
remind us of its origin. The laws
of organic growth and heredity do
not hold here. Hut as the builder
of a steamship is free to ignore all
the steps in the evolution of the
parts of a modern vessel, and
choose the best material and latest
devices that mechanical engineering
has to offer, so in our educational
system there is nothing in its na
ture to prevent our making it what
we please.
When we come to consider the
vastness of well-ordered real knowl-i
edge at the present time, the in-1
tensity of intellectual activity, the
great number of important prob
lems thrust upon us, the crowds of
errors as well as the multitudes of
truths that crowd upon our judg-i
ment, and the tierce competition on
every hand, requiring the best
equipment in modern knowledge
and method, there is the most ur
gent reason that our educational
system be cleared of everything
that interferes with its cleanest ac
tion.
The elementary system needs no
longer the endless patching up of
its motley mixture, the strange re
sult of necessity, empiricism, and
accident. It has had enough of
the fanciful apologies of the phi
losophers for its existence, and of
mystic pictures of its fancied rela
tions to an imagined soul. It
needs to be completely reorganized
from the foundation and put in
relation to the life of today.
As for our higher schools, the
universities, they have become
freer to react to the times. They
are every year becoming less under
the influence of the inane and in
active scholasticism which made

the most narrow of definitions of
culture and set her up as a goddess
and established about her a puerile
ritual and a most bigoted hierarchy.
First in Germany and then in
America the university broke away,
or is breaking away from these
bonils.
The university is no longer to be
simply the conservator of the past.
It should be the leader and stimu
lus of the present and the prophet
of the future. Every phase of in
tellectual activity should have its
place in the university, where will
he gathered its literature, where
may be collected its facts, and
where will be grouped masters in
its science who stand ready to im
part its spirit and drill in its
methods. Throughout the whole
will prevail thoroughly the scien
tific spirit and method, and that
complete freedom in choice of sub
jects and career absolutely neces
sary to strongest development.
Our own university in America
most nearly approaches in spirit
such nn ideal, and if such a life
here is not universal it is at least,
possible to all, and many there be
who live with enthusiasm up to this
possibility. 1 congratulate you
that during your eduoational career
you have had the possibility of
breathing with freedom something
of the spirit of the times. May
you that go and you that remain
vividly appreciate this too rare a
privilege, and cultivate and guard
most jealously this spirit. May it
become an instinct with us. May
we be quick to resent and ever ar
dent to oppose any taint of the old
regime which may seek admission
among us, and thus threaten our
freedom and undermine our intel
lectual manhood.
