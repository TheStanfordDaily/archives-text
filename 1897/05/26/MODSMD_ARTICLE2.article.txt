# THE
						PASSING OF PLATO
## Commencement Address by Professor Jenkins. 
### 
The stupendous changes that
have been wrought in the material
life of the civilized races in a short
period of time by the progress of
modern science have been generally
recognized. We have to make only a
casual investigation into the history
of the production of the things that
would come under our view at our
first turn, to find complete revolu
tion in production, manufacture,
and distribution. We find further
that it is not in each a single change,
but revolution on revolution the
most radical. For example, in le*s
than twenty-live years the immense
and complicated bus.ness of transit
in our cities has passed from omni
bus to horse car, from horse car to the
cable system, from the cable system
to the electric car system, with
special variations in the way of ele
vated railroads and pneumatic rail
ways. Methods of lighting, heat
ing, production and transference of
power for motors, have passed
through equal strides of change and
improvement. Everything con
nected with the immense business
of t transportation, from the great un
dertaking of bridge building and
steamship structures down to the
sealing of a freight car or the exca
vation of a yard of rock, has in a
like period passed through radical
revolutions that are bewildering in
their rapidity and in the greatness
of the interests involved.
This change and this advance
have appeared not alone in these
large and conspicuous phenomena
of activity, but in the countless
other lines of human industry
change has followed change. Im
provement and advance on what
lias been just past have been the
constant movement of the time.
On account of the complex relations
that exist in a community, a single
new invention may greatly affect
many occupations other than the
one in which the invention is used.
Consequently as matters are now
going, it is beyond mental grasp to
comprehend the breadth and depth
of these changes. As the result of
them hosts of old occupations have
been destroyed, innumerable ones
have been completely and radically
revolutionized, and hosts of new ones
have been created. This has made
a wholesale destruction of old rela
tions and a wholesale creation of
new ones. And with all this have
come and still must come the most
severe strains on the structure of the
community in the readjustment of
these relations.
This condition of the present time
appears more striking when we con
sider that more and greater changes
have occurred in the material life
of thecommunity and the adjust
ments these have brought with
them in the last ten years than have
occurred in any thousand years pre
vious to the ninteenth century.
It is agreed on all hands that all
these marvels of change and im
provement in the setting of our ma
terial life have been the result of
the application of the scientific
method to t he study of nature. Kven
those who suspect science and decry
the scientific method and warn the
elect against both, acknowledge the
service that science has done for

what tliey style the material man.
They, as promptly as others, de
mand of the hotels, railroads, ar
chitects, and publishing houses that
they take advantage in every way
of the latest that science has to
offer. We have no longer, then,
to contend for what science has ac
complished for this side of human
life.
These marvels are of profound
interest and with an outcome im
possible to foresee; but interesting
and significant as these results of
science are, it is still another phase
of the effect of the modern scien
tific method that shall detain us at
ibis moment. Too large it is and
too comprehensive —too far-reach
ing to be brought to more than
mere notice in so short a time. It
is the effect of science on the
thought of the time, and more spe
cifically its effect on higher educa
tion and the university.
The expression, ''The thought of
the time," as generally made use
of, is not accurately descriptive.
Strictly speaking, the thought of
any time has its manifold expres-

sion in Jill thiit, the people of the
time do or produce, whether it he
in the form of manufacture, works
of art, customs, institutions, or the
varied forms of written expression
that have come from them. Hut
the expression is more usually lim
ited to those more formal products
of mental activity represented hy
its literature, systems of philoso
phy, and formal sciences.
The enumeration of the triumphs
of science frequently includes only
the list of remarkable appliances
for bettering our material life. Hut
the scientific method has also be
gun to affect most profoundly the
other side of human life. It
is revolutionizing the methods of
thought in all phases of mental ac-
The progress here has been more
slow, uncertain, and unsuccessful.
Men are more ready to change the
appliances of a new home, the
methods of travel and communica
tion, and even their methods of
thinking in business relations and
active life, than the}' are to change

in all those matters not immediately
connected with material life in which
there is a fierce and definite compe
tition. But a brief examination
will show the profound influence of
this method.
Turning back to the most pros
perous age of Greece, we find the
Greeks sympathetic lovers of na
ture, as their life and art have
shown. They were students, too,
of nature, groping not wholly
blindly, as demonstrated by many
of their conceptions that have
passed down to us. There arose
among them Socrates and Plato —
the teacher, and his literary exec
utor and expounder. With the
purest and best of motives they un
consciously did the race a disser
vice that became a bar to progress
for the ages that followed. They
sought fundamental truths with the
commendable purpose of settlingall
questions of ethics for all time.
If the universe is the product of
fundamental principles, the long
ages of succession of events, with
their differentiation, synthesis, and
evolution, have complicated matters

immensely and buried fundamental
principles so deep that it is impossi
ble to discover them, in the external
universe. Consequently, not quickly
finding their required principles
and definitions in this external uni
verse of nature, and without un
derstanding why the universe could
not furnish them, they turned their
inquiries within. And the mind is
so constituted that it can make any
hypotheses and then proceed to
build a system logically based on
them. Hence they had no trouble
to obtain the definitions required.
These were of ihe mind alone.
Then to defend and hold these it
was necessary to do away with the
rest of the universe. So from that
time on, mind was the universe;
mind and matter had nothing in
common. Nature was to be over
looked, despised, and shunned as
gross, corrupting matter, and only
flights of mind were real and worth
any serious consideration.
This whole legitimate outcome
did not immediately follow on the
innocent diversions of Plato. It

whs not until after Aristotle—whose
genius won him a place of go large
authority—had taken up these
phases of thinking and put them
in form to he used that they came
to exert so extensive and powerful
an influence. Aristotle was him
self in a way a student of nature of
great promise. But to his large
line of successors, hardly followers,
the mental flights were more at
tractive than his bugs and fishes.
So the world went into the occupa
tion of what has been stvled "pure
thinking"; that is, thinking not con
ditioned by the presence of any fact
of the gross universe.
Then arose one after another the
so-called great thinkers, men who
solved all things by introspection
and contemplation. Then the sys
tems of philosophy spread over
Western Europe like cobwebs over
a lawn of a summer morning. The
early writers of the Christian
Church, tlie Christian fathers, also
wove a tissue of theology by the
methods and with the inspiration
of Plato. And thus the warp and
woof of the intellectual life of ages
consist of what has been styled
the "lazy philosophy of Plato."
The church, the state, and the
schools, literature and art, were
dominated by the methods which
seek fundamental principles by in
trospection and on them build each
its peculiar structure, by the con
ception that the mind of man was
the center and content of the uni
verse, and all else was either gross
or unreal. Investigation and col
lection of facts were not only un
necessary, but they all belonged to
that netherworld which could only
serve the purpose of interfering
with the lofty movement of pure
thought.
Through all this long period of
pure thinking no contribution of
value to progress can be pointed out.
At long intervals protests appeared
against the extreme conditions
brought on by these methods.
These protests culminated in the
Renaissance and the Reformation.
These movements were the express
ion of the true instinctive love of
man for nature and the real. They
brought new life again into the
world, but their leaders could never
shake themselves clear of the very
methods whose results they opposed.
It was with them the instinct to
return to the true position without
the training to maintain it. Con
sequently their movements, re
freshing as showers after a long
drought, produced no far-reaching
radical changes and but slow and
diversified progress. They were
rather a rush to the enjoyment
of nature once more, and not a
serious study of her, while the
methods of thinking were little
changed.
Thus matters stood until the be
ginning of the present century; and
with this immense past and the
slavish reverence for the past these
conceptions and methods, like the
"Old Man of the Sea," still hang
upon the neck of the present move
ment. Hut as this lusty giant grows,
the "Old Man's" days are num
bered.
All through the darkest of this
unproductive period, real students
of nature, scattered here and there,
more or less stifled by the attno
