# MANZANITA HALL.
## A
						Modern Type of Secondary School. 
### 
During tlie last few decades there
has been a steady revolution in the
material and methods of education.
The movement started in the uni
versities, and when the new views
had won their way to recognition,
they began to affect the conven
tional ideas connected with second
ary education. One subject after
another has received its adoption as
available material for mental dis
cipline. This increase of subjects
has been accompanied by a con
stant protestof the best minds in all
departments of education against
reduction in the length of time de
voted to each subject. Admitting that
each subject is entitled to a certain
amount of time, views divide again
on the question whether the subject
should extend over a long period of
time covered by short recitations
which come only a few times a week,
or should be confined to a shorter
period covered by longer recitations
that come daily.
The best results in college work
come from concentration on a few
subjects at a time. Karl Ernst
von Baer, the fat her of Embryology,
at the close of a long and successful
career as an investigator ;i nd teacher
expressed the view that for the
mature student concentration on a
single subject would secure better
results in a few weeks than distri
bution of energy on a variety of
subjects will secure in a. very long
time, ami that even during earlier
training there is more danger from
dissipation than from the opposite
tendency.
Leaving lazy people out of the
question, the most serious weak
ness of students entering college is
their lack of power to concentrate
their energies and to work hard
and steadily. Many of them have
never had a taste of the kind of
work required fora successful col
lege career, hence many faithful
students find their freshman year
so very difficult.
Manzanita Hall has adopted a
single aim and has pursued it
steadily, until now there is no
longer any doubt that at least for
the accomplishment of its principal
object —the preparation of students
for the University —it chose wisely
in adopting the principle of con
centration. This choice was almost
inevitable, because in its organiza
tion the school would necessarily
reflect the influence of the new
plan of entrance requirements
adopted, by the University. Its
flexible course of study, its persist
ent refusal to offer a smattering of

anything, its plan of concentrating
the student's attention on few sub
jects at a time, have all been in a
measure the direct outcome of the
plan of University entrance re
quirements, jind have hten abun
dantly justified by the results.
Although there is no official con
nection between them, the rela
tions of the school to the Uni
versity are growing more intimate
every year. The school has only
completed its fourth year, but it is
already sending more boys to the
University than any other second
ary school not supported by taxa
tion on the Coast.
