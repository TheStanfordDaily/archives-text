# THE 						WHOLESOME WORLD.
## Address by President Jordan to the Members of the Graduating Class. 
### 
We have been four years together
in this quiet restful corner of the
world. As you go forth today
from Palo Alto it rests with me to
say a parting word. It shall bean
old word, as old as humanity —a
plea for old-fashioned goodness.
"The earth is upheld by the in
fluence of good men," so Emerson
tells us; "they make the world
wholesome." This is your mission
in life, to make the world whole
some. The power to help men by
example, by word, and by deed —
this is the meaning of higher edu
cation. Its function is to destroy
misery, to lead men to be happy
through being wise and good. This
is the only way to happiness, and it
should be your privilege to know
that way and then to walk in it.
For the fruits of the spirit are love,
joy, and peace—on California's
sunny bills today, just as they were
of old at Galatia and Ephesus.
Kants tell us that there are two
things in the universe which above
all others impress him with their
marvelous grandeur. These are
the starry heavens, and man's sense
of duty. Perhaps, you and I would
find other marvels as great as these.
Perhaps we would find both of these
mere phases of the one sole primal
marvel of the Universal Truth.
The infinitely great is no more per
fect, no more marvelous than the
infintely small. The starry heavens
are no grander than the group of
atoms in the living molecule of pro
toplasm. In the unerring response
of the single cell to its relation to
the rest of the universe we may find
foreshadowed man's sense of duty.
It was God's sense of duty be
fore it vvas man's.
In an address at Yale, some years
ago, President White asks us if we
do not sometimes forget the true
meaning of higher education. Do
we not use that term to indicate
simply "further education?" By fur
ther education he would mean sim
ply continued education, without
broadening of outlook or strength
ening of soul. What higher educa
tion should signify, Mr. White then
goes on to explain: "It is that which
ennobles the further education,
which lifts il out of the category of
tools for possibly mean ends; which
aids to make men not merely sharp
in intellect, but strong in heart and
mind and soul, which makes jurists
rather than pettifoggers, large men
of business rather than stock gam
blers, statesmen rather than politi
cians, Christian apostles rather than
sectarian propagandists. It is that
which would give us in science and
philosophy reverent seekers after
truth, and not dogmatists or leaders
of cliques. It is this which would
enable educated men to realize that
life is worth living and to determine
what it is worth living for; which
would make our national life some
thing more than a wild rush for
place or pelf, which would make
the individual life something more
than a game of grasping and grip
ing with a whine for mercy at the
end of it."
The purpose of wisdom is virtue.
Wisdom is knowing what ought to
be done; virtue is doing it. Edu
cation is to make men wiser that
they might be better. To make
them stronger or more learned with
out this would be nothing. To
"sharpen the claws and whet the
tusks" of a beast of prey is no wor
thy function of higher education.
The university should be first and
foremost a school of morals. If it

is not so, it can lnive no excuse for
being. 1 do not mean that it should
be the dispenser of moral precepts.
It should teach morality through
the influence of earnest lives. The
dried maxims of ethics are not
right living.
The Devil, it is said, has all the
ethical precepts at his tongue's end,
and can even preach upon occasion.
All these maxims he needs in his
business. They help him to satisfy
men with second-best action, to put
respectability in the place of moral
ity.
To be moral is to be human.
''Men speak of morality," says
Emerson, "as though one should
say 'poor God—with no one to help
him.'" The virtues of sound
character are all the virtues there
are. Doing the right thing in the
right way, be it large or small, is
the means by which character is
made. To be just and true in com
mon things is to be ready to be
just and true in great ones. One
acquires a taste for it. It becomes
a part of bis normal functions.
This is the value of conscientious
work of any sort. The conjugation
of irregular verbs is no great part
of the business of life. We have
often, to borrow Thoreau's word, "to
leave a Greek accent slanting the
wrong way while we right up a
fallen man." But the habit of
conjugating verbs correctly may be
the making of a sound character.
The habit of being all one wishes
to seem may make an average man
a saint or a hero, if he stands where
saints or heroes are needed. For
no man becomes a hero all at once.
The occasion gives him nothing
that he did not have before. The
hero has spent years in slow and
patient preparation The saint
lias been long on the way to martyr
dom, and he has been made ready
through loyalty to the best he knew
in the humbler affairs of life.
In the same way no man ever be
came a great knave without a long
and humiliating preparation for it.
1 see many at work today on this
preparation. When I find a stu
dent who is an adept at devious in
trigue, or who is living as a parasite
on money or ideas borrowed never to
be repaid, or who seeks for pleasure
in ways that he knows can bring
only humiliation,! realize what is in
store for him. He need not fear his
teachers, for they stand only as a
symbol for punishment. Their
hearts are tender and their arms
are short. They will not follow
him far. lie shall have his reward.
He shall have whatever he has
paid for —preferment in college pol
itics, high marks, easy living, lie
shall find his name written where
ever he would write it, but the force
of character he shall not have.
"Unstable as water, thou slialt not
excel." There can be no strength
of man or woman in which the
sense of duty is not the controlling
force.
The man is as strong as his con
science is. This lesson, then, is yours.
He true to the best you know. Do
the best thing you can. If you
know something better to do than
what you are doing, quit at once
and take it up. You can not afford
to do second-best things, if they are
second best to you. The second
best virtue is sin. Sin is the choice
of the almost right. If you do the
almost right and are satisfied, then
you are ready to drop another step
in the moral degradation. The
right will slip from you and only
the wrong will be left. To fail to
do your best from day to day is to
fall to the very lowest at last. This
has been true ever since man first
began to think and act for himself,

and to sin because he fell short of
his best possibilities. Knowledge
of good and evil, the power of choice
in conduct, has within itself tre
mendous possibilities. It gives on
the one handall wisdom and virtue
and strength; on the other hand,
it makes possible all folly and fail
ure and decay. It is not for us to
choose whether we will take this
responsibility. It is already on us.
It is the gift of civilization. The
keys of fate are in our hands.
Whatever we unloose remains with
us and with our children to the last
generation.
So the knowledge of good and
evil demands that we shun evil.
The power of choice insists that we
choose aright, and the insistence of
it does not grow less as the years
roll on. The moral law has not be
come lax through all these centuries.
It is as severe and as kind as it was
in the days of the Hebrew prophets.
It has not changed since the night
of the flaming sword. For our own
wrong doings each must answer
for himself. At, the bar of our own
conscience there can be neither piea
of ignorance nor call for pity. You
can grant yourself no release if,
knowing the right, you do it not;
no pardon if not knowing what you
ought to have known. To be tol
erant towards our own weakness is
to be well along on the road to
death. Self-pity is part of the an
aesthesia of decay.
It is the conscious setting aside
of the best in action that destroys
the soul. It is the sacrifice of duty
to cowardice or pleasure or greed
which saps the foundation of char
acter. It was said of the poet, I'aul
Verlaine, that he chose to give his
soul to God and his body to the
Devil. But before he died the Devil
had taken them both. In his slavery
to bodily impulses the poet had lost
the power to choose between right
and wrong. At last he was sensi
tive only to wrong, because the im
pulse to right action disappears
when it ceases to be all-powerful.
Every sin, personal or national,
brings its own increment of death.
The oldest word of human experi
ence is the truest word today: ''The
soul that sinneth, it shall die."
There is, of course, no simple
test of what is right and what is
wrong. There is no formula which
can apply and never make a mis
take. There is no schedule of
righteousness. If there were, life
would be too easy for you. It would
be too simple to be made effective.
Only the animals have the right
placed so that they can not mistake
it. Their power of choice is so lim
ited that they can not go far astray.
You can never wander farther —for
better or worse. It is the business
of your lives to make your own
tests, to find the right and shun the
almost right—each one for himself.
You must each day strengthen
yourselves for this search by carry
ing each day's decision into action.
A generous education has opened
for you a thousand doors to suc
cess —a thousand more to failure.
It is your part to choose. To be
educated is a dangerous thing. The
responsibility for choice is intensi
fied a thousand fold. Hut to be
educated aright is to be fearless of
danger. It is to be prepared for
the conquest of danger.
Character is built up by doing the
best you know. Effectiveness con
sists in doing t he I test thing that any
one can know. Effectiveness in this
sense is more than character. Jt, is
the second power of character. It is
virtue wrought into action. An ig
norant man or a foolish one may
be good enough in a negative way,
but he can not be very helpful. The

best he knows is not the real best.
Hut as educated men and women,
we have the right to expect the real
best of you.
The enlightened conscience will
resist all forms of contamination.
All that injures me is bad, and
equally bad is all that is harmful
to others. All that weakens or
destroys body, mind, or char
acter must come under its con
demnation. We expect you as
apostles of the higher educa
tion to stand against wrong, resist
ing not only the positive vices and
crimes, but also the subtler evils
of dilute virtueand flabby morality.
You will find among the influences
for evil the vast inertia of indolence
and lethargy. Weak books that
destroy the mind may be as dan
gerous as vice that eats up the soul
or crime that deforms the body.
Not all that is wrong wears the
visible livery of the Devil.
The spirit of evil has all
times and all places for its
activities. But of all the delu
sions with which the Devil cheats
the soul of man, the desire to get
something for nothing is the most
wide-spread and the most danger
ous. The "deadhead" is the Devil's
sign manual with which he brands
his own, his sheep as well as his
goats. There is no lasting joy with
out its cost of effort, no privileges
without corresponding dutits. no
happiness without responsibility.
The hope of somehow getting that
which we have not earned, whether
in power or privilege or enjoyment,
is the chief source of human misery.
Happiness comes from striving,
doing, loving, achieving, conquer
ing—alwayssomething positive and
forceful. It can not he found in
idleness. The pleasures of debauch
ery and dissipation are only coun
terfeits. Each joy that conies
through drugs or stimulants is
charged against us to be paid in
misery. The pleasures of dreaming
are the joys of fools. Only through
realities come the pleasures that
last.
'• 'Tis heaven alone that is given
away." All in life worth having
has its price. It must be paid for
in effort, in tears, in phiyers; and
can be had on no cheaper terms.
The gods maintain no bargain
counter. Their favors are never
marked down, never going at a sac
rifice. Tlieir prices are always the
highest, but they always give full
measure. Thev yield tlie best, and
the best is their demand.
If you have learned this lesson
and have wrought it into your lives,
yours is indeed the spirit of the
higher education. To pay your
debts in life as you go, to ask for
nothing without rendering its equiv
alent, is to do your share in the
work of the universe. Your life
shall make the world wholesome.
