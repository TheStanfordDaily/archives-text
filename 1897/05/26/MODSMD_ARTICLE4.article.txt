The Class of '97 has had its own
part in the life and tradition of the
University. It entered at the dark
est period of the University's life;
but two months had passed since the
hand of death had fallen at the
University and removed therefrom
one of its honored founders. Those
were dark days, and still more were
to come when there ensued a long
period of litigation threatening the
continuance of the University and
the perpetuity of its endowment.
But there came brighter days, and
we rejoiced when the trial was
over.
Through all these changing
scenes of the four years the class
which graduates today has passed,
and in the joys and sorrows of the
period it has participated. Its im
portance as a factor in the Univer
sity's history may not be great, but
its influence will be felt That a
record of its work may be pre
served, to the Class of '97 we ded
icate this Commencement Edition.
