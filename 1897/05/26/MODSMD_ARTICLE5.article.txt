# Ninety-Seven's Four Years.
## 
### 
Four years are not a long time
in the life of most universities for
obvious reasons, but in one such as
our own where little is static as yet,
where things are in a plastic state,
four years may make important
changes. Our own class entered
when the "Pioneers" were juniors,
and it was our good fortune to re
ceive a careful training at their
hands. To future generations of
Stanford men we who are "original
Ninety-sevens" may justly deport
ourselves as pioneers, possibly sec
ond-grade pioneers, because we
have known nearly all of the Stan
ford men and have lived nearly all
of the Stanford history up to date.
It is quite customary when one
becomes retrospective, for him to
laud the good old days when the
dangers of cable cars and kerosene
lamps were undreamed of, or when
wheat was two dollars a bushel, or
if the individual be a Stanford
alumnus, he will prate about the
old days of Ninety-five or Ninety
six when this or that was true
which is untrue today. Doubtless
things are changed, but certainly
the general result has been a bet
terment.
As was said, however, the last
four years have brought changes
with them. The freshmen of today
can not appreciate the old enthu
siasm over athletic success which
led a great mob of us in our tirst
year to don nightgowns and caps
and march all over the campus,
down to Mayfield, up to Palo Alto,
and back of course to Roble, yell
ing. ''Who beat the Olympics? We
did! What was the score? Forty
six to nothing!" Those were the
days of organized enthusiasm, when
Encina dining-room had every
table full but one, and when one
needed no further exercise than try

ing to get into the dining-room for
each meal among the first fifty.
The passing of Encina as the
backbone of Stanford spirit and the
dominant factor in student politics
is the most regrettable result of our
four years. I believe of course that
our college spirit is as strong as
ever at bottom, but the old demon
strative element is lacking. The
changes in student political forces
have been as marked. The "frat"
and the "non-frat" feeling has
abated to a great extent. This
may be due to the discreet retire
ment of one of the contestants from
the field owing to a substitution of
popular for board elections; it
may due to a growing intimacy
among all elements of the students.
But it seems to the writer that the
principal cause has been the decay
of Encina as a political factor. Pos
sibly the days of Dick Crokers are
not over yet, but they are numbered.
A great mania for organization
has characterized Stanford life
during the past four years. Every
possible idea or aim seems to have
become a basis for some organiza
tion. Many of them have a good
and sufficient raison d'etre. These
will of course survive, but the next
few years will probably usher the
remainder out of existence. The
danger is, however, that our idola
trous worship of precedent for its
own sake will prolong some of their
lives unnecessarily.
The University will never again
know such a day as that when the
Supreme Court decision was handed
down. What a day to remember!
The writer had the good luck to be
one of the four men who got the
news from the bus driver and
started the ball rolling with the
dear old yell. Jt was the end of
the third hour. Of course fourth
hour recitations were cut by pro
fessors and students alike. The
Roble girls paraded the quad,
whooping and yelling in a truly
manly fashion. Quadrilles were
danced on the quad, and every girl
who had "a swain on the football
team" wore a Varsity sweater.
Everything was painted red that
night. Menlo and Mayfield saloon
properties appreciated in value, and
insurance risks went up. Next
day was a red-letter day for the
liverymen, for almost the whole
student body went back into the
mountains fora snowball fight.
Our class has lived through an
interesting period of our Universi
ty's history; but great as is our
love for her, we do not presume our
selves better in that regard than
other classes. It is simply a way
we have at Stanford. This never
failing loyalty of Stanford men to
their alma mater is the basis of
Stanford success everywhere. We
can never have an athletic team
without it. Our victory in debate
this year, while due primarily to the
admirable work and abilities of the
team, came largely because of the
Stanford spirit which backed them
up.- One can not speak of some
things without being trite. Bacca
laureate sermons, graduating ad
dresses, and class . valedictories
have, from a certain point of view,
worn all the possibilities bare, yet
from the standpoint of those di
rectly concerned, such things can
never grow old. So it is with our
love for our University; its green
lawns, spraying fountains, and
shaded avenues, and the mountains
j which close it inâ€”it can not grow
old. And the memory of this
home of our best friendships and
highest ideals will prove to each of
us a proper substitute for the old
Spaniard's fountain of perpetual
; youth. J. M. Ross.
