# CLASS HISTORY.
## Read at Class Exercises by H. Z. Osborne, Jr. 
### 
The third class to take the en
tire four-year course at Leland
Stanford Junior University entered
September 4, 1893. Notwithstand
ing the fact that the attractions
of the World's Fair tended to draw
bright young students to the great
western metropolis, and that the
path of the University was be
ginning to be rough and rugged,
over three hundred special and
regular students entered under the
banner of the Class of '97. Of this
number but seventy-six took the
entire four-year course, although
about eighty-five per cent, of the
graduates this year have taken
their entire university course at
Stanford.
The departing class has taken a
prominent part in the social life at
Stanford. Since the graduation of
the Pioneer Class its members have
received the sweetest smiles from
Roble. It suggested and carried
through the first sophomore cotil
lion. Receptions given under its
auspices have been the society
events of the year. Some of the
society lights of the departing
class have already flickered out;
but while they darted from flower
to flower, resplendent under the
summer's rays, admiration and at
tention were theirs.
In a literary way the wearers of
the white and red have come prom
inently to the front. Besides hav
ing furnished a number of asso
ciates and assistants on the college
publications, three members of the
graduating class have edited the
Daily Palo Alto, one the Sequoia,
and one the Engineering .Journal.
The class can always point with
pride to its volume of the Stanford
Quad. In music it has also made
its mark. Ninety-seven men or
ganized the Mandolin Club and
the Band, besides furnishing lead
ers for these popular organizations.
The class has always been con
servative as regards rushing. The
files of the Daily Palo Alto show
that it has not been because of lack
of courage or strength. In the bar
barous days of the University,
when each class carried a chip on
its shoulder, rushes were numer
ous. Three victories to two defeats
is '97's established war record.
Our athletic record has been sat
isfactory to all concerned. In foot
ball the '97 team won its first
game, and its last game as Seniors.
The latter victory decided the Uni
versity championship. In base
ball our Freshman nine made a re
markable record, and won the class
championship with ease. Our base
ball game with the Faculty is too
fresh in the minds of everyone to
need more than a passing remark.
Two University track records are
held by members of the class.
While the history has exploited
the records of the men of the class,
the young ladies have taken their
share of interest in University
affairs. I am credibly, informed
that all have paid their class as
sessments. As freshmen they won
the hearts of their fellow-classmen
by bravely appearing in class colors
just before a rush with '96, a crowd
which was dangerous unless care
fully but firmly tied with insulated
wire.
Taking the class as a whole, it
has made a record for attending
strictly to business. No class debt
has been left behind to mar the ex
cellent record of those who have
gone before. In closing, 1 might
add that the class does not ad
vance the threadbare claim that
the machinery of the University

will stop on the graduation of the
class. It does claim, however, that
its presence will he missed, and it
hopes that some kind hand will oc
casionally remember the Class
when brushing off the dusty shelf
to which the mortal remains of '95,
'96, and '97 have been consigned.
