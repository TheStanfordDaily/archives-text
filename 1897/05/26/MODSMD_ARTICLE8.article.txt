# THE
						PLATE UNVEILED.

Dr. Jordan and Fellow Student*:
A year ago today the Class of
'1)6 met here beneath these arcades
and in loving gratitude to their
alma mater dedicated to her a
memorial plate. It lies there now,
a silent but powerful witness to the
four years of success and achieve
ment of our predecessor.
To the Class of '90 belongs the
glory of inaugurating a graceful
ceremony; upon the Class of '97
devolves the privilege of insuring
permanency to it. The first plnte
is an innovation, the second is the
real establishment of a custom;
a custom that can but live, founded
as it is upon the affection and
loyalty of men and women for ;i
home of four auspicious years; and

cmH we doubt that the expression
of this sentiment will not live also?
A good custom will he self per
petuating, a. had one will die of its
own unworthiness; and so we be
lieve that this dedicating of class
tablets will slowly creep, year after
year, down, around, across, and
back again the whole circle of the
arcades. May it be so, and some
time some contemplative freshman
will stand at the head of the line |
and wonder "what those old fossils I
were like"; will wonder "what
they did in their college days.'
We can answer that question now.
We are endowing .t university for
him ; we are establishing customs
that he will inherit; we are giving
to the college that individuality
that will attract him to its halls;
we are making for him an institu
tion that he will be proud to call
alma mater.
A few years ago :i friend of mine
visiting at Harvard I'niversity
paused before an inscription on one
of the buildings, a simple number
'0:4. A Hood of speculation ran
through his mind at once, and an
immediate identification of .that
class with the spirit of the timej
arose. How those Harvard men, |
high-bred and peaceable, answered
the country's summons to war, and
hastened to exchange the black
coats for the bine —and they:
proved that the gentle soul could
make the hero.
That simple inscription of '(>2
stands not so much for events, for
failures or success, as it does for that
thunderbolt of enthusiasm and that
spirit which flamed out at the
touch of the lanyard. It is not j
alone to commemorate the events;
of the past four years that we place
this tablet here. It stands for the
spirit of this class —for the whole
hearted loyalty and ceaseless devo
tion of the Stanford Seniors to
Stanford University. It is the ma
terial, the tangible manifestation
of what our lives and works must
some day prove. We want this
plate to mean something .to the

! University. We want the thou
sands of students who are to pass
and repass over it to feel that a
| tithe of the success of the institu
tion is due to this class having
been here ami gone out into the
world with the enthusiasm and in
spiration that each individual
could not but acquire.
To us the plate stands as a seal
upon four years replete with every
good influence, every happy mem
ory, every ennobling impulse that
an ideal environment can bring. I
Tons it means a material embodi
ment of a university spirit which i
spontaneous, which dues not de
mand a specific culture to develop
it, but conies uncalled for and un
aided a spirit which we can see
in every eve, imbibe from every
| heart, and feel in the very air.
And to us it means a connecting

link between our little isolated life
here and the world which is now
before us.
Could it be otherwise than that
the profound sentiment which
makes the past live for us in this
plate should deepen our sense of
obligation to the future by showing
us our debt to that past. Let me
repeat, this plate is the tangible
expression of that courage and vir
tue, that unselfish devotion which
our experience here has inspired
in us, and which will make our
lives nobler and more complete
W hen the ivy bus overgrown these
walls and the flagging has become
worn by the tramp of generations
of feet, may this spot remain, not
dearer to us than any other spot in
the quad, but at least the focus of
that affection which attaches u> t<>
every atom of the fair structure;
ami may we become imbued with
this love,
" Till the place becomes religion,
Aml our hearts run o'er wit h
silent worship."
We put this plate here with full
knowledge of what part the wear
and tear of time will play, and yet
we trust that it will remain as long
as Heaven permits the work of
man to last a fit emblem of all
for which we intend it to stand.
To me has been assigned a pleas
ant duty, in fulfillment of which I
now in the name of the Class of
,( .)7 present to Stanford I'niversity
this plate, the last offering of the
Seniors.
