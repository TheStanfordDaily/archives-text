# Dr. Jordan's Acceptance.
## 
### 
I :ii» glad to receive the Stanford
plate of the ('lass of 1897. It is
in) 7 proudest hope that I may he
here to receive such a gift, front
many a class to follow. In my
thoughts 1 can see this of
bronze tablets cornering one upon
another in a lengthening line; a
line of gold on the brown and gray
of these cloister floors, till the
whole quadrangle is made brighter
by their presence.

1 n the nature of things, when the
fair year of 2017 comes, we shall
mid ourselves at this point again,
in front of the nohlechapel of which
noble souls have dreamed, hut
which I efore many years shall he
.1 reality. The date when the first
circuit of the quadrangle is made
shall he as far in the future as the
Crusades are in the past. _Who
shall say what crusades lie before
the class that completes this cir
cuit then, and what work shall lie
before the lion-hearted kings of
i.it who >11;i 11 he its leaders.
l»at even this will not he the
end of the hrazen tablets. There
arc four series more to he run, and
it will he only in the far-off year
•">01) 7 when each of ihe brown
squares is replaced by bronze. 1
shall not be here to receive the plate
when that time conies, and the
place shall he so crowded with later
memories that not even my ghost
can find floating room. But this
does not matter. Others will be
here and they shall he adequate for
whatever tliev may have to do.
lint this does not lead lis to the
end. There are gray squares as
well as brown ones to be replaced,
and I here are other metals besides
the bronze which we have chosen.
By that time, it may b.>, the views
ot Boss and Zion may prevail, and
we shall hi ve silver wherever silver
is needed. We shall need it for
silver p'ates, and for;) 20 ) of these,
alternating with the bronze, there
will be rmill in this ■ jiiadrangle.
I'liis tvill lake us on to 82V)7. And
then there will be the outer quad
rangle, with all its possibilities, and
the other quadrangles; the one to
the east for science, the one to the
west for arts; u cx oririilc lu.r, ex <><'-
ciih'iita the knowledge of the
ISast and the action of the West, at
last together in harmony. With
all this our line shall lengthen for

;i hundred cons more So the row
of metnoria 1 ta 1 >1 ets now so short
shall extend on and on, like the
trail of a bishop on a limitless Held
of chess, a streak of gold through
the hrown and grav of our I Diver
sity life.
i like to think t hat in like j
fashion our university influences I
shall extend out through the life of
our country. Kadi of you shall he.
a Stanford memorial plate, not of j
brass altogether -not even of i
bronze, but of pure gold; thirty-two |
to one, the best mintage of human
ity. There shall go out from here
—to change the metaphor —a streak
of cardinal that shall run through
the whole web of American history;
that which is yet to be written be
cause it is yet to be made.
Someday we shall have here a
chair, not alone of American his
tory nor of the history of Califor
nia, these we have now, but one
which shall treat of the influence

of California on the United States.
Stanford in American history will
he a subject for theses at which no
man snail smile.
You have heard a word today of
Harvard in American history. Our
sister Harvard was here before lis,
and she has made a record already.
She has been needed at many a
crisis. Hut there shall be other
crises before this long line shall be
completed. They shall he our op
portunity.
You have heard what Harvard
did in 1882. It shall be as impor
tant in 1962 to know what is the
thought and deed of Stanford,
On some field of sacrifice weshall
have our memorial roll as long and
as noble as that of Harvard, the
best of these
"When faith and truth
On war's red touch-stone rang true
metal.
Who ventured life and love and
youth
For the great prize of death and
battle."
As sweet and a> strong a record
as this shall our own Stanford me
morial b*. 15 it lb • battles of 11)52,
let in h >|>e, will not take place on
tin tented field, not at Cold Harbor,
nor in the Wilderness. Ours shall he
the endless campaign of wisdom
against the li >sts of error and terror
and folly and wrong.
It is your fortune, as Mr. Huz
za rd has so well said your fortune
and mine to be here when the little
series began It it ours to lay down
the statutes; to establish the land
marks, to endow the University wit li
traditions and associations.
And when the twentieth century
wears on to its end we shall have
reached with this series only to the
last door of the chemical labora
tory. Out from that door will
come the new influences which, in

like fashion, hluill <■; 111 to (hose of
like spirit in the glorious twenty
lirst; the marvelous arid beautiful
man that shall he, and the equally
wonderful and charming woman.
So all these days these plates shall
stand as the seal and signal —e-K'h
of four years of happy memories,
sweet influences, impulses that en
noble. Each shall represent the
spirit of virtue and action, of good
ness, genuine and spontaneous, the
righteousness of life that comes un
called, like the songs of birds. This
shall be the spirit of men and wo
men who know the way of life, who
feel its duties, who fear no danger
and reck no defeat, who "ever with
a frolic welcome take both the
I blinder and t he sunshine."
In the name of Iceland Stanford
Junior University that is, and in
the name of the millions of Stan
ford men and women that are to be,
1 accept the Stanford plate of the
Class of 1897.
