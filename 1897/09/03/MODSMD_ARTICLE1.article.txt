# THE 						FUR SEAL HERDS.
## To Devise Plans for Their Preservation Dr. Jordan Goes a Second Time to Alaska. 
### 
After making one trip to the
Pribylof Islands in 1896 as Pres
ident of the Behring Sea Commis-
Bion by appointment of President
Cleveland, Dr. Jordan was prevailed
upon by President MeKinley soon
after his inauguration last spring to
go to Alaska again this summer as
a representative of the American
Government to see what could be
done to prevent the extermination
of the fur seal herds.
George A. Clark, secretary to
President Jordan and also to the
Fur Seal Commission, left about the
middle of May for the North, sail
ing on the steamer Del Norte. Pres
ident Jordan left Seattle on the
tourist steamer Queen on the morn
ing of July 5. He was accom
panied, by permission of the Treas
ury Department, by Dr. Wood of
the department of Hygiene at Stan
ford, who went to make a personal
study of the life processes of the fur
seal; and Elmer E. Farmer, in
structor in Electrical Engineering at
Stanford, whose work it was to
brand the seals by electricity.
At Sitka, July 15, the party
was transferred to the Albatross
and proceeded from there to Una
laska. Here the revenue cutter
Rush was placed at their service
and conveyed them to the Pribylof
Islands.
On the island of St. Paul, which
was reached July 28, Mr. Clark
was found. He had collected val
uable notes on the breeding habits
of the seals earlier in the season.
While here the American party was
joined early in August by Professor
Thompson, the British Commis
sioner. The results of his investi
gations bore out the conclusions
reached by the American Commis
sion.
President Jordan's views of
Alaska and the North will be of
particular interest to the students
here. We quote the following from
what he has had to say concerning
the trip:
"All Alaska's resources are being
wasted just as rapidly as they can
be. If things go on for ten years
more as they are going on now,
there will be nothing left in Alaska
but starving Indians and gold hunt
ers. The great wealth of fishes
and fur-bearing animals that might
have been conserved for centuries
under wise management will be dis
sipated, and nothing will take its
place, for Alaska has no future in
agriculture.
"An important part of our sum
mer's work was to investigate the
sea otter problem—to see whether
at this late date it is possible to
save a few remnants of this most
valuable of fur-bearing animals.
The sea otter once swarmed along
our coasts from the Kuriles of Japan
to the Farallones of California,
while now we have ordy a. few hun
dreds left, mostly in the bays be
tween Kadiah and Unalaska. The
last year's catch of the sea otter
(upwards of a thousand skins) by
schooners has taken nearly all there
are. The remedy for this abuse is
to allow no more schooners to en
gage in the business, and it must

be applied this winter or never.
With the passing of the pen otter
all the self-supporting Aleuts from
Kadiah to Attu —a distance of
nearly 1,500 miles—become paupers.
''The use of schooners, enabling
the hunters to kill ten years' in
crease of sea otters in one, is the
chief cause of the disappearance of
the sea otter herds. Over-hunting
is the secret of their destruction.
With any group of animals the
moment the number killed each
year exceeds the number reaching
the adult age extinction begins.
Commercial extinction follows very
soon, though of course the actual to
tal destruction of any great herd of
animals is a matter of years.
"But we learn that the last fur
seal of Guadalupe is gone, the last
sea elephant, the last sea cow. If with
the close of the nineteenth century
we have wholly exterminated all the
noble and useful sea beasts discov
ered by the bold explorers of the
eighteenth, then the twentieth cen
tury will rise up and call us ac
cursed. Serve us right, too, for
cities and ships can be rebuilt; even
forests can be restored; but the
great extinct animals, never. And
the great animals of the sea occupy
territory which can never be used
for anything else. Great cities will
rise where the buffalo herds once
ranged; when the fur seal and sea
otter are killed off their islands be
come deserts. Their death leaves a
hiatus for eternity.
"The decline of the herd is every
where more distinctly marked than
it was last year, owing to the resump
tion of pelagic killing in Behring
Sea after the modus vivendi of 1893.
For 1898 the shrinkage will be still
greater, through the destruction in
1894 of unborn pups with impreg
nated females killed. Thus the evil
effects of pelagic sealing in any par
ticular year are most clearly felt
three or four years later. But if pe
lagic sealing should be stopped at
once, the decline of the herd must
go on until after 1900, because of
the after effects of the destruction
of nursing, and unborn offspring.
"The only new fact of special in
terest discovered this year has been
that a parasitic worm infecting the
sandy rookery areas is the cause of
a large part of the early mortality
among pups which was ascribed in
a general way last year to trampling.
The early mortality on the whole
shows a decrease relative to the de
creased number of animals.
"Branding of young female seals
will be begun after September 18
by Colonel Murray, Chief Agent of
the islands, and E. E. Farmer,elec
trician. The skins of the branded
cows returned this year to the is
lands show clearly the permanency
of the mark and its efficiency to ren
der the skin unsalable, without in
jury to the animal or to the herd.
"Branding has the same effect on
the fur seal herd that branding
calves or shearing sheep has on these
classes of animals. The idea that
the seals might be driven away by
branding is sheer nonsense. The
brands are perfectly distinct, not
withstanding the fears of the hys
terical Mr. Elliott, and they are still
perfectly distinct on the adult fe
males branded, nearly all of whom
were seen in their places this year.'"
