# New Football Coach.

Football Manager Switzer in se
curing as varsity coach George C.
Brooke, Pennsylvania's great full
back, departed from the tradition
that Stanford's coach should come
from Yale, where the other Stan
ford coaches, Camp, Bliss, and
Cross, learned the game. His choice
is especially fortunate inasmuch as
last year the coach was a line man.
With a line almost as strong as
last year's, Coach Brooke will be
able to devote much of his time to
the backs and to the development
of a fullback, in which his long ex
perience as fullback and his famil
iarity with the formation of inter
ference will be of the utmost value
to the team.
Coach Brooke was graduated
from the University of Pennsyl
vania with the class of '96, having
played fullback on the varsity for
three years. Prior to entering the
university he had captained the
team of the Swarthmore prepara
tory school. As fullback he won
the highest praise, prominent foot
ball authorities ranking him
equally as high as Butterworth of
Yale.
Casper Whitney in selecting his
all-American team of 1895 said of
Brooke: "There is no difficulty in
choosing a fullback. Brooke is un
questionably entitled to that dis
tinction for his marvelous kicking,
which includes proficiency in every
department of that game, his line
bucking, and his running through
a broken field. Not since Butter
worth has another such an all
round fullback been developed,
and although Brooke excels But
terworth in drop-kicking, their
punting is about even, and Butter
worth is superior in advancing the
ball."
The Harvard- Pennsylvania-Cor
nell series of games in 1895 was won
by Pennsylvania. In the Harvard
game Brooke kicked a field goal
which won the game for Pennsyl
vania, 17-14. In the Cornell game
Pennsylvania won, 4(3-2.
Coach Brooke is expected to
arrive at Stanford about Sept. 10.
The football management is exert
ing every effort to have the field in
shape by the time of his arrival.
At U. C., Nott, captain of Brown's
'95 team, has the team in charge
and will be assisted by several of
Berkeley's ex football heroes.
