Editor Daily Palo Alto:
As the affairs of the Class of '97
were not fully settled until after the
close of the college year, and as the
first issue of this paper will be
mailed to most of the absent mem
bers of the class, we desire to take
this opportunity of informing them
of the general result of our work.
The old debt of $330 on the '97
Annual owing to 11. S. Crocker &
Co. was paid in full, and sufficient
funds were raised to defray all com
mencement week expenses. A sur
plus of about forty-two dollars was
turned over to Dr. (loebel for the
benefit of the Hildebrand Library.
The class is much indebted to Mr.
Chris llenne for his kindness in
transferring to it his claim of $150
against the Associated Students. A
note for this amount, made by the
treasurer of the Associated Studei ts,
was accepted by Crocker & Co. and
applied upon the Annual debt.
\Ve wish also to ex press our grati
tude to the professional actors whose
services contributed so much to the
financial success of the Senior Farce.
That the large class assessment
of live dollars was the most success
ful in the history of the University
is due to the loyalty of the class and

to the untiring efforts of those mem
bers who did the collecting.

Chairman Finance Committee.
