We take pleasure in announcing
that definite arrangements have
been made to deliver this paper in
I'aln Alto hereafter on the evening
of its publication. Heretofore much
of the paper's value has been lost to
Palo Alto subscribers on account of
its late delivery. The work of car
rying a paper in a town of Palo
Alto's extensive area is so great that
there is little likelihood that this ex
tra work would ever be a paying
investment for the management of
the Daily Palo Alto which had
the temerity to start it. But if the
move is met with proper support
in the University town, we believe
that from the standpoint of the pa
per's future the extra trouble will
be well worth while.
