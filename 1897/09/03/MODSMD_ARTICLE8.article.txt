The Associated Students of this
University levy upon student
an annual assessment of one dollar,
and it is urgent that this should he
paid at once. The student body is
not out of debt; obligations remain
standing against the treasury which
amount to almost eleven hundred
dollars. At the close of last year
in spite of the efforts of the various
student body ollicials, to whose in
terest it was that the exact state of
the student body finances should be
known, certain roseate reports were
circulated that the student body
was entirely out of debt. One reason
for this was the publication of one
of Treasurer Morrison's reports re
lating to the old debts paid. This
was construed to mean by those not
familiar with student body affairs
that the student body was entirely
out of debt, when as a matter of fact
in order to pay the old debts, which
had been standing for three or four
years, the treasurer was obliged to
allow part of the expenses of the

year to remain unpaid. Hence, al
though no debt stands against the
association which is of more than
one year's standing—that is, no old
debts —yet we have a debt for the
year of almost eleven hundred dol
lars.
The rumors above referred to
have not assisted the collectors of
the student body assessment, and
yet never before was its payment
more urgent. In order to secure
the services of Coach Brooke a
large payment had to be guaran
teed him on his arrival. The scar
city of water on the campus, owing
to the emptying of Searsville Lake
early in the summer, will increase
several fold the expense of putting
the football Held in condition.
There is no money in the treas
ury. The team must be provided
with outfits. Interest on the debt
must be paid. The necessity of
paying the student body assess
ment at once could not be more
manifest.
The treasurer will place receipt
books at the University postoffice
and at the office of the Daily Palo
Alto. Collectors will be appointed
and announced at once. Every stu
dent will be given an opportunity
to pay his or her assessment, and a
proper loyalty to student interests
demands that it be paid imme
diately.
