# THE 						SAME OLD FIELD
## Student Body Decides Not to Move the Football Grounds. 
### 
The football lield will remain
where it is. That was the unani
mous sentiment of those who at
tended the mass meeting in tiie
chapel Friday afternoon, called by
President Morgan for the purpose
of settling the location of the field.
The attendance was not large, but
the business was transacted briskly.
'1 he reason for calling the meet
ing lay in the fact that it was im
possible to secure sufficient water on
the campus to put the old field in
condition. Early in the summer,
by the orders of Resident Archi
tect Hodges, Searsville Lake, from
which the most of the water used
on the campus and at the stock
farm is supplied, was drained in
order to be cleaned. The water
supply of the University is now
drawn from Felton Lake, which
hardly furnishes a sufficient quan
tity for ordinary use. The football
management thus found itself very
much embarassed. It was decided
to call a mass meeting of the stu
dents and to lay before them two
propositions: first, to leave the
field in the old place and to raise
the additional money needed to
haul the water from Palo Alto; or,
second, to build a new tield in the
arboretum, which would save one
third of the expense, as the ground
there could be ploughed, harrowed,
and rolled without water. Two
lields could be built in the arbore
tum for the price of putting the old
lield in condition. The old tield is
hard and dry, and would require a
great deal of water before it could
be ploughed.
'1 he two propositions were laid
before the meeting- Geo. Culver.
'97, made a motion to retain the old
lield. Captain Cotton, Treasurer
Pomeroy, and Manager Switzer
spoke on the motion. Captain
Cotton was strongly in favor of re
taining the old field, asserting that
it would be practically impossible
to train a team in the arboretum.
He urged every one to pay their
student body assessments, as in that
case the student body could meet
this emergency without going in
debt any more â€”and still have
enough money for expenses.
Treasurer Pomeroy stated that
only about one-third of the students
had paid their assessments, and
urj.ed the student body to be more
loyal in this regard.
Manager Switzer explained the
difficulty in detail, and urged the
paying of assessments as the only
solution.
Culver's motion was unanimously
carried, as was also Manager Swit
zer's resolution that it be the sense
of the meeting that every man and
woman in the University should
pay their student body assessments
immediately. Collectors then re
ceived student body assessments.
Treasurer Pomeroy announced
that receipt-books would be placed
in the University post office and in
the Daily Palo Alto office, where
assessments could be paid. Receipt
books will also be placed in the
hands of members of the Executive
Committee and others. A list of
every student in the University
will be made, and checked off as fast

as assessments are paid. A strong
effort will be made to collect every
assessment.
