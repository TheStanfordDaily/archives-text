Studk.nt sentiment last Friday
was unanimously in favor of locat
ing the football gridiron near En
cina Mall, as in former years. It
must be clearly understood, how
ever, that in voting for this proposi
tion the student body voted for the
one involving the most expense, and
incidentally pledged itself to niise
the additional amount by creating
a strong sentiment in favor of pay

ing student body assessments.
When collectors are put in the field
this fact should render their work
easy instead of irksome. Enthusi
asm is cheap and worthless if some
of it cannot be transmuted into dol
lars when an emergency arises. An
emergency does exist at present,
and it should be met by according
financial aid to the football man
agement. The easiest way to do
that is to pay the annual student
[ body assessment.
