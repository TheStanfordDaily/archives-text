The following letter was sent by
a member of our.staff from St. Paul
| Island, Pribylofs, Alaska about a
j week after President Jordan left
I there:
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Our party since the departure of
Dr. .Jordan, Dr. Wood, and Mr
Clark, comprises Instructor Farmer,
Warren, 'US, (Ireely, '98, Soodgrass,
J " ( JS, Edwards, '00, and Bristow Ad
ams, '00, also a Mr. Kincaid of the
University of Washington, who is
well known as an entomologist. Our
time is variously devoted to collect
ing and working among the seals.
The seven of us live in what was
' once the billiard hall and keep bach
elor's quarters with fine system,
1 each having his day for house-work.
The difliculty is for those who are
not naturalists to keep the sitting
and living room free from "ehuch
: ils" (Aleut for specimens), which
I are left around indiscriminately,
I and for long periods, by members of
the Zoology department.
There is a surveying party on the
| island this summer, the assistants
j being fellows from Chicago Univer
isity and Amour Institute. The na-
I lives have been astonished several
1 times by the "Palo Alto bark" and
the "Go it, Chicago," and also by the
combination of: —
"Chicago, Stanford,
Seals and Survey,
St. Paul, Pribylofs,
Rah, Rah, Ray."
We manage to get much fun out
of the trip, and some hard work;
hut all of us are anxious to get back
to Stanford, although we shall not
arrive until about October 3.
