# Reform for the Halls.
## 
### 
j A radical change has been made
! this-year in the management of the
| two dormitories. In speaking of
J the changes made, President Jordan
said that heretofore the halls had
competed with outside boarding
places. It has been found that a
competition on this bash: can not be
maintained. It is impossible to
make the boiird in the hal.s cbeaper
than at the private boarding houses.
The only way to keep up the halls
is to make the board better than can
be obtained outside. That is the
plan to be followed this year.
The Encina and Roble dining
rooms are placed this year under
different, separate, and more compe
tent management than heretofore.
The price in both places has been
raised to twenty-five dollars a
month for board and room.
Mr. and Mrs. I'. S. Weaver, of
San Francisco, will have charge of
Encina dining-room during the
coming year. They have consulted
with Dr. Wood regarding a strictly
hygienic diet, and his suggestions
will be acted upon in the prepara
tion of foods to be placed before the
students. An especial attempt will
he made to have plenty of fruits
and vegetables on the table daily.
Mrs. Weaver will attempt to in
troduce a home atmosphere into the
hall, which has been entirely lack
ing in past years. She will have a
room litted up for students suffering
from slight sickness, where she can
see that they receive proper care
and nursing.
Mr. Adderson still has charge of
the room-rents at Encina.
At Roble, Miss Gardiner, who ran
a boarding-house on the row last!
year, will be in chargeof the dining
room. Mrs. Baker is still matron, I
but Miss Kay, '5)7, has been ap
pointed assistant matron. This is
a move in the direction of Stanford
graduates for matrons at lioble in
future years.
