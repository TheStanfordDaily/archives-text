# FOOTBALL OUTLOOK.
## Changes in the Team and our Prospects in the Coming Game. 
### 
Them am moth score of 20-0 which
the Stanford Varsity rolled up last
year against U. C. has not lessened
the ardor of the Stanford football
men in the least. Almost a year
has passed and their appetites are
keen for another football victory.
This summer has been one of ac
tivity for Manager Switzer. The
absence of Captain Cotton laid upon
him the entire responsibility of se
lecting a coach. 11 is select ion meets
with universal approval. The base
ball tournament at Central Park
this year lasts up to Thanksgiving,
and that made it impossible to hold
either the Thanksgiving game or
the preliminary games at Central
Park. After a long series of nego
tiations, Manager Switzer and Dr.
Frank Angell, for Stanford, and
Everett Brown, for U. C., signed a
contract fora two years' lease for
grounds on Eighth and Harrison.
The set (lenient of the foot ball sched
ule was only arranged after tedious
delays. Finally the question of a
lield at the University was settled
last Friday.
Captain Steuart Cotton returned
to the University last Thursday.
He will be ready as ever to play
wherever he is needed, being in this
respect Stanford's most versatih
player. 11 is preference is, however. I
fora position behind the line, where
he will doubt less play.
Coach Brooke will arrive about
the 10th, and will then assume
chargeof the training of the team.
Very little active work can be done
before that time until the grounds
are in shape.
Of last year's Varsity, Straight,
end, Williams, center, and Sea
wright, halfback will not return
Those of the Varsity who have al
ready returned are: Cotton, full
back ; Carle and Fickert. guards;
diet Thomas and .Jack Rice,
tackles; Bay Smith, end; Fisher,
halfback; Murphy, quarterback
Jeffs has not yet returned, but is
expected to do so. Of the substi
tuteson the Varsity last year, Free
man will not return, and Harring
ton has left for the Klondike.
'"Billy" Mcintosh will contest again
for quarterback, Janie< for tackle,
and Parker for end. Mithing has
been heard of Burnett, '00, who is
the most promising candidate for
Varsity center. Dole will not try
fora position this year, and will
devote himself entirely to track
work.
The loss of Clemens, Soper, Free
man, Mctiilvray, Harrington, and
Blanchard, all of whom will not
return this year, may weaken our
second eleven very materially, un
less the Freshman Class develops
unusual strength. The second
eleven men who will contest for
places this year are: Adams and]
Bigelow, guards; James, Beckett,'
Ballentyne, and Rusk, tackles; Hig
gles, P. Smith, Leavitt, and Par
ker, ends; Daly, Plate, and Ben
Thomas, halfbacks; Mcintosh,quar
ter; Latinagan, fullback.
The material in the Freshman
Class seems to be good. Probably
the player best known to the Stan
ford bleachers is Phil Wadsworth,
captain of the Belmont team which

defeated Ihe 1'.)()() class team last
year. Wadsworth scored a touch
down on the freshmen from the
kick-off. He is a gritty player and
is clever at end running and run
ning through a scattered tield.
Beckley, end on the Belmont team
last year, is a sure tackier. A. K.
Dole, half and fullback on the lliv
erside team, should make good
showing. Wilson enters with a
good record, having been halfback
and captain <>!' a Los Angeles team.
llu-s played halfback on the
Oakland School team. .Man
ley was halfback on the San Mateo
School team. Wyckoff, an Oakland
High School graduate, is a promis
ing candidate for fullback, having
had considerable experience in this
position. He is familiar to Stan
ford sj ictatois as an active and
clever player. Phil and Ed Oil
man, who enter from Manzanita,
seem to have the weight necessary
for line positions. They will try for
center and guard. Maples played
tackle on the Pomona College team,
and has a. good reputation as a
player. Yoss was quarterback on
the Throop team. Strout enters
from the Santa llosa High School,
where he was captain and tackle on
the school team. Erb played quar
terback on a Sound team.
The Freshman Class seems strong
in men for positions back of (he
line, but lacking in men of weight
for line positions. In order to de
velop a strong le:tni plenty of can
didates must come forward. The
showing of the class at this early
period of the season is good.
