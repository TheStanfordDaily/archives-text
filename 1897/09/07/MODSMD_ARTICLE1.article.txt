# DOLE'S EASTERN TRIP.
## Stanford's Representative Takes High Honors in Athletic Meets. 
### 
An instance of '95 loyalty and
enthusiasm was well exemplified
this summer when one afternoon it
casually became known in San
Francisco that Charlie Dole would
have to give up his expected trip
East because of a lack of funds.
Charlie Field, '95, was the first to
hear of it. lie immediately con
ceived the idea of appealing t<>
members of the Pion-jer Class alone
to subscribe the money necessary
for Dole's athletic expenses. Prompt
action was required, for Dole would
have to start in two days in order
to be in time for the Western Inter
collegiate meet at Chicago.
Field communicated at once with
Miss Davis, ex-'95, with Sheehan,
llarrelson, and Pice, '95, and the
plan was heartily endorsed.
Within twenty-four hours from
the first intimation that Dole could
not go the money was all pledged
by Pioneers residing in San Fran
cisco, subscribing on their own ac
count and in some instances for
their friends, whom they knew, if
present, would wish to co-operate.
A telegram was sent to Dole here
on the campus, and the next even
ing he started for the East with the
well wishes of a little group of '95
men that accompanied him across
the bay as far as the Sixteenth
street station in Oakland and there
gave a parting Stanford yell.
Starting from San Francisco
.June 1, Dole arrived at Chicago
four days before the Western Inter
collegiate meet,and was entertained
as a guest of the Chicago Athletic
Association. Dole entered three field
events, the broad- and high-jumps,
and the pole-vault, lie failed to
qualify in the high-jump, which
was the first field event, but, won
the broad at 21 ft. 34 in.and the
pole-vault at 10 ft. 6 in very hand
ily. After all bis competitors had
dropped out in the pole-vault, Dole
set the crossbar at 11 ft. 2 in. to
break, if possible, the Western In
tercollegiate record. But Hersch
berger's pole, which Dole had used,
had mysteriously disappeared and
could not be found. The trial was
made therefore with another pole.
By a fraction of an inch his attempt
failed, much to the disappointment
of the athletes present, and much
to the delight of Stagg, the Chicago
coach, who did not wish any records
broken by others, not members of
bis own team": Though there was
no student following for Dole, a
number of the spectators consti
tuted themselves as Stanford men,
and yelled at every opportunity
for him.
From Chicago Dole went to New
York where he engaged in light
work in preparation for the Indivi
dual All-round Championship
meet which was held under the
auspices of the New Jersey Athletic
Club at Bergen Point on the sth
of July. For six solid hours the
nine men entered from different
parts of the country toiled in the
ten events. Clark of the Boston
Athletic Association was first with
a percentage of Cosgrove of
the N. J. A. C. was second with
5.694, and Dole third with 5.484 J,
all three having shattered the record

made by Sheldon of Yale in the
preceding year. Clark, it will be re
membered, played a prominent
part in the Olympic games at
Athens two years ago. Cosgrove
was all-round champion in 1895.
The trip as a whole was emi
nently successful, and has proved
that in Dole Stanford has the best
all-round athlete who is today in
an American university.
