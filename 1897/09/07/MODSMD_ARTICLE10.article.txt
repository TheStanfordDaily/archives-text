The Daily Palo Ar/ro has placed
a manuscript box at the corner of
the University postoffiee in which
matter for publication in this paper
may be left at any hour of the day.
It is the rule of all papers never to
publish anything which is sent to
tbe office unsigned, and we are com
pelled to follow that rule strictly.
Sad to state, the omnipresent
"josher" is in our midst and lie de
lights in nothing quite so much as
to have thecollege daily make state
ments which have afterwards to be
corrected. To protect the paper
against impositions of this sort, we
must be aide to locate the responsi
bility for every statement it makes.
The signing of articles is simply
taken as evidence of good faith, and,
so long as the statements made are
authentic, the names of those send
ing in matter for publication are
suppressed and are never known to
any one except tbe editor.
