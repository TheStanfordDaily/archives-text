# The
						New Grounds.

### 
The grounds on which the
Thanksgiving game in the city will
be played this year are located at
Eighth and Harrison. The Cen
tral Park grounds have been leased
for the season for a, baseball tourna
ment. The Harrison street grounds
have been leased by the two univer
sities for two years from T. B. Robin
son, head of a stock company own
ing the grounds.
The tract is larger than the Cen
tral Park field, being 850 by 415
feet. The contract calls fora cov
ered grandstand that will accommo
date 351)0 people. Bleachers and
boxes will be built before the big
game so that accommodations may
be furnished for the fifteen thou
sand people who will probably at
tend the game. The field can also
be used for baseball, and the future
games of baseball between Stanford
and Berkeley will lie played on
these grounds instead of in the nar
row quarters at Central Park.
Provision will be made at the
new grounds for tally-hos and
coaches, which will undoubtedly
add a new incentive for the forma
tion of footba 11 parties The grounds
are accessible by the Market and
Sutter street cars.
