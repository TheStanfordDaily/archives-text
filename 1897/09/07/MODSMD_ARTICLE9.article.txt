We are much indebted t<> three
former editors of the Daily Palo
Alto —Messrs. Rice, '95, Timmons,
'97, and Nourse, '97 — for valuable
aid in securing news of former stu
dents and members of the alumni.
It would be hard to find three grad
uates of Stanford more loyal to her
interests and future* welfare than
are these three. They evidently
have not yet forgotten all the trials
of the college editor sitting at his
desk with dilatory assistants on one
hand and restless compositors on
the other.
