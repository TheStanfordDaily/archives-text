# LAST NIGHT'S LECTURE.
## President Jordan Delivers an Address Full of Helpful Suggestion. 
### 
The first lecture of the year was
given last night hv Dr. Jordan. As
is usual when it is known that
President Jordan is to speak, the
house was crowded and many who
came to hear the lecture could not
even find places to stand within
hearing distance.
The subject of the lecture was
'"What youth is for." Its main
purpose was to outline the relations
of the student to the University.
in opening Dr. Jordan quoted
what Bismarck had said regarding
the students of the German univer
sities: "One third kill themselves
bv excesses; one third work into the
grave; and one third govern Eu
rope."
What is true of Germany he de
clared to be just as true of the
United States, though perhaps in
less degree. The three classes of
students mentioned by Bismarck
may be found in any of our Ameri
can universities. Class one goes to
the dogs; class two to the grave, not
from college statutes but from the
laws of nature. It does little good
for the university to waste its time
and resources on these two classes.
Its purpose should be to train the
third class and make them last.
There is no use to educate the
man who is a slave: a slave to stim
ulants; a slave to narcotics; a slave
to lust; a slave to cowardice; a slave
to selfishness. If we can not rouse
them, then let them go. Bad men
make bad environment. They
propagate rowdyism, vice, and
weakness. In a university we want
men. The influence of manhood is
catching and is the strongest power
for good. Men rule nations. Never
did majorities rule; but men, men
of power.
"The color of life is red." The
men of strength have the tempta
tions of strength and they must
meet and conquer them. The pur
pose of youth is to be strong at
some later time. The world cm res
nothing for the rattleheaded,
drugged, blase man, old before his
time. An education is dearly
bought which comes at the expense
of shattered nerves.
The third class includes those
who can take care of themselves;
who can check their impulses; who
can realize the value of power.
These govern Europe. These gov
ern America. Upon these ' your
"cherishing mother" can fondly
look and say: "These be my chil
dren."
In the course of his lecture I)r.
Jordan read an article by one of
his former pupils on the subject of
"Capital in nerves." It contains
so many helpful hints and is so def
initely along the line of what is en
couraged among students in this in
stitution that we print it today in
full. The article is by Dr. Wil
liam L. Bryan and is as follows: —
"1. Fatigue attacks first the
nerve-centers. Nerve fibres are un
weariable; muscles long outlast the
nerve cells. The latter show meas
urable signs of fatigue after a few
seconds of hard work. They may
readily be worked down to power
lessness.

"2. If you wish to picture what
is taking place in the nerve-cells
while they are becoming fatigued,
watch a roasting apple as it shrivel.-
up. Hodge's experiments exhibit
this process.
"8. You sometimes work nearly
all night. There comes a time when
you seem to recover from fatigue.
You feel yourself at your best.
What is the cause? You are
drunk. Fatigue has poisoned your
blood and this has intoxicated you.
You had better get drunk some
other way. This is about the worst
way.
*'4. Go on. You are young.
You recover readily. Study as late
as you please. Dissipate. What
then? You find yourself in a state
of chronic fatigue. You can not ac
complish anything. Perhaps you
are oppressed with unreasonable
gloom. Perhaps you are haunted
with insistent ideas. Perhaps you
feel weighted down, incapable of de
cisions or action. In other words
you are a melancholiac. You are
insane. You are in a state of
chronic fatigue. What is a di
ploma worth to a man who has
used himself up?
"5. What shall one do?
"(1) Eat. Don't think it neces
sary to have books. It is not. Job
had none. Homer had none. But
you must eat. Don't eat bad food
if you can help it. Protect your
stomach from surprise parties when
you can. Get up a club of people
who are willing to pay more now,
and less for drugs hereafter. Then
find the best cook you can.
"(2) Slkkp. Sleep as long as
you want to. Don't steal from
sleep for study, or sleepiness
will steal it back from study. The
rested brain can remember better,
can concentrate better. What is
worth more, in the rested brain
things shoot together, and there is
a new thing, a new idea, a discov
ery. Sleep regularly. The ner
vous system has its rhythm. Goto
bed at a certain hour, rise at a cer
tain hour for two weeks, and the
nervous system adjusts itself to
that rhythm. Violate that rhythm
by sitting up several hours later,
and you have up?et yourself. If
you are young and strong you can
stand it —awhile. But at last, as
Dr. Jordan used to say, the fool
killer will find you out.
"(8) Avoid Drugs. Maybe what
you are using will not hurl you —
coffee, tea, tobacco, cocoa, sleeping
potions, whatever drink or drug
you take. Maybe the nerve tonic
you take is good for you. But you
should try to be sure whether it is
or not. Maybe you do know and
won't quit. Very well, then, the
fool-killer is already at work.
"(4) You know that there are
other and worse kinds of dissipa
tion. You know whether any of
them touches you. "Sowing wild
oats" is the phrase. If it were only
a phrase! Wild oats always get
into the spinal cord and sprout.
Presently you find with horror that
you are all grown through.
"(5) Exeroisk. 1 am dissatis
fied with our college athletics.
Eleven men in the fall and nine
men in the spring get exercise. We
shall have this year six hundred
students. It is not enough for the

five hundred and eighty to hurrah
at the twenty's game. Whose fault?
Surely nobody's fault but your own.
Go to the gymnasium. Or play
hi. nis. Or saw wood.
(<>) "Be cheerful if you can—if
you can. For probably you are
morbid ,ind gloomy and blue just
because your nervous system is
touched with chronic fatigue. But
be cheerful if you can, for good
cheer will help make you well.
That is not poetry. It is a fact that
your gloom or your cheer radiates
out through your body, affects the
circulation of the blood, affects the
nutrition and upbuilding of tissues,
makes you sweeter or sourer, and
lo! presently your cheer is reaping
a fine harvest of new and health
giving cheers, or your gloom is reap
ing a fine harvest of new misesies.
So be cheerful if you can. Don't
brood. Take a walk instead. Don't
!»e too full of introspections and re
morses. Go do something worth
while instead. Don't worry over
the destiny of man.
(7) Finally, be wise if you can,
be rich and be famous, win what
prizes you can from money and
knowledge and power and grace;
but keep well while you are about
it. If you are tempted to let your
nervous capital go to waste forsake
of any advantage whatever, pray
think yourself ten years older hold
ing that prize but holding it in a
nerveless hand.
"'But then 1 must quit college.'
Well, quit. Go be a cowboy. The
plains of Texas are better than a
mad-house. An axe swung with
strength and joy is better than a
classic pen shaking in the hands of
a paralytic.
"'No, but I can't be a cowboy,
nor chop, for 1 am a girl.' If I
were a cynic I would say, 'Oh, in
deed! Well, then, of course, all
this does not apply. If you are a
girl, nature will doubtless be gal
lant. . Surely, if you are a girl, na
ture will not whip your face with
wrinkles, nor shoot you through
with misery, nor cover and crush
you with glooms, nor poison the
whole world for you, by killing your
power of joy. So have jolly times
or get ready to teach, in either case
without regard to expense.'
"But then I am not a cynic, since
1 was twenty. And so 1 beseech
you do not burn the candle at both
ends. Don't let it burn too long a
time at either end. 1 wish you felt
that it were a disgrace to do so.
Save the candle. You will not get
another. Jf you dim the one you
have, 1 know not where is the Pro
methean heat that can light re
sume. Save the candle. Go to
bed."
