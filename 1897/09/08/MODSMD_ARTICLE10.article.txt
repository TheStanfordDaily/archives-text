Class organizations should, if
possible, transact the preliminary
j business of the year within the next
j week, before the University work be
; gins to press too heavily upon class
members. Several of the classes
â– 
j have business hanging over from
| last year which should be settled at
! once. Nearly all of the organized
classes are in debt to a greater or
j less extent, and the sooner plans are
1 formulated for eliminating these
I debts the better it will be for the
| classes in the months preceding
i their graduation. The best advice
: which can be given to the members
of the Frsehman Class, as yet unor
' ganized, is to keep their class out of
debt. The way to do this is not to con
tract liabilities for which there
j is no money in the class treasury
or for which there is no money
immediately available. By this
means only can their class be kept
free from debt.
