j candidate for. <; Heff" Williams'
! place at center, is detained at Ade
laide by business, lint when seen it
| week ago by a Stanford football
1 man was planning to enter the
1 University as soon as he could get
| a way.
Captain Cotton can not as yet
make any definite estimate of the
i football strength of '01. It is a
large class, and from a short inter
val of inspection seems to contain a
large number of the type of physi
cal man required for football. Be
| sides, there are several men who
come to us with good reputations,
made in preparatory schools and
other places. Among these are:
Wyckoff, Wadsworth, the Ciilman
! brothers, Wilson, Thayer, 11]rb,
Beckley, Road, Craig, Manley, Bur
i meister. and many others. Captain
Cot ton will lie better able to know
what the new class brings after the
! meeting tomorrow.
