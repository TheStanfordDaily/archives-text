Tiie Christian Association re
ception to the Freshman Class
comes this year a week later than
usual. This has given an oppor
tunity for those in charge to pre
pare an attractive program for tin
evening and also for the new stu
dents to become somewhat ac
quainted with members of theirowi
class and others so that they need
not as heretofore stand about in ab
ject loneliness while the upper
classmen enjoy themselves. The
purpose of the reception is to pro
mote goodfeilowship among all
classes represented in our Univer
sity life. It does not belong exclu
sively to any class or faction: it is a
University affair. Everyone is in
vited to attend.
