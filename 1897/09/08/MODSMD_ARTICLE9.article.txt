The class that lnis entered this
year has doubtless already become
familiar with the two of our publi
cations which come out daily and
I weekly. There is, however, another
| field for the literary man of '01 to
work in. This is on the Annual, a
publication in book form issued ev
ery year by the junior class, this
year by '99. Prizes of ten dollars
each have been offered for the best
poems and stories and any artists
who have entered this year can find
' no better field to display their ;ibil
ity than the competition for places
in the Quad. The books of previ
ous junior classes, 'V)o, '96, '97. and
'98, may be seen in the library and
an idea obtained from them of the
| kind of work desired.
