### 
The Executive Committee of the
Associated Students lielcl its lirst
meeting last night. Business of
importance was considered.
Manager Switzer presented the
contract made by him and Mana
ger Brown of Berkeley with T. I'.
Rohinson for the new football Held
in San Francisco. The committee
accepted the contract for the year
1897-98, which calls for the games
of the football season of 1897 and
three baseball games in 1898, at a
total price of $2,700. The supple
mentary contract entered into by
the university managers for the
football season of 1898, submitted
at the same time, was not acted
upon as it was not thought advisa
ble for the present committee to en
tertain an obligation which would
take effect after its present term of
office had expired. A resolution of
the committee was substituted,
promising the personal support of
the members to make the supple
mentary contract good and to rec
ommend favorable action toward it
on the part of the football manager
for 1898 and the Executive Com
mittee for the University year 1898-
99. Manager Switzer will submit
the action of the committee to the
contractor in the city today.
An appropriation not to exceed
$75.00 was made for the erection of
a permanent grandstand for foot
ball and baseball in accordance
with plans presented to the com
mittee by lihoads, the Palo Alto
architect. The stand will be eight
tiers high, about one hundred feet
long, and will accommodate about
live hundred spectators.
