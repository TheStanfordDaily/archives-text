Every one of those who have en
tered the University with the Class
of 1901 should begin at once to take
an interest in the affairs of that
class. A meeting has been called
for tomorrow afternoon to effect a
temporary organization. By this

Class should be well enough ac
quainted with each other to be able
at least to select a man for president
who will not be entirely forgotten
before the end of the year.
