A plan for increasing the effi
ciency of the Library with regard to
the special needs of classes is in
vogue in several departments of the
University. A voluntary assess
ment is levied upon the class —the
class of course voting on the propo
sition and the members exercising
their own free will in the matter —
and the money thus raised is spent
in buying duplicate books most used
in the course, or in buying books
whicharenot in the general library
The books thus purchased are
placed in the general library, where
the members of the class have free
access to them. By this co-operative
method the members of the class re
ceive a benefit which is entirely out
of proportion to their individual
outlay. As time goes on and the
books are handed down to succeed
ingclasses, it is clearly evident what
a far-reaching effect this plan, care
fully carried out, will have upon
the University library. This plan
as outlined is simple and effective,
and can be carried out to good ad
vantage in many classes. Its ex
tension should be encouraged.
