Those who are just beginning the
work at Stanford may as well i»e in
formed at the start that persons are
not tolerated in this institution who
are inclined to take unfair advant

age of their fellows. To illustrate
the treatment persons of this char
acter may expect here, we need only
mention the cases of cheating dis
covered last week among students
taking the entrance examinations.
As a result, one student who came
from the East to enter Stanford is
doubtless now somewhere on the
road back to his home beyond the
Rocky Mountains.
There were in all five of
cheating brought to light hist week.
In every case the students have
been refused entrance to the Uni
versity. In one case a young wo
man who had already been ad
mitted upon certificate, took the
examination and passed in the pa
per with another person's name
signed to it. Of course, in that
case two brilliant lights were re
moved from the ranks of the pros
spective Freshman Class. Two
cases were discovered in the Latin
Prose examination and one in Eng
lish la. Two of these were sent
away for copying and one for per
sistently asking aid from those
about him.
It has been the policy of this pa
per heretofore to suppress a great
many things which it is unpleasant
to call t»> the attention of the Uni
versity community, but if it is pos
sible hereafter to secure the names
of those sent home for cheating the
Daily Palo Alto will place before
its readers the name of every per
son leaving the University for this
reason.
