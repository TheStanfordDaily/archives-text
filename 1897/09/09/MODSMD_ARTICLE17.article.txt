# Information Bureau.

### 
An information bureau for stu
dent labor lias been organized by
the faculty committee on student
aid this year. This committee has
existed as long as the University
itself, but its work has been very
informal. Too much dependence
was placed chiefly in the voluntary
efforts of individual members. The
great need of organized effort was
emphasized on the minds of the
committee by the constantly in
creasing demand of students for em
ployment. To satisfy this demand
the faculty committee has formed
an organized bureau of information
for the benefit of students.
Thin bureau is so conducted that
it is considered an improvement on
systems used in other universities.
At the University of California a
manager is employed on a salary to
attend to the business of the society,
while the services of the Stanford
committee for students'aid is given
free of charge.
One of the principal difficulties
which the committee has to meet is
that the work that has been done
bv students, and might still be per
formed by them, such as cutting
lawns, caring for gardens, moving
furniture, and doing housework,
has been taken by outside parties.
This is chiefly due to the fact ihat
students are inexperienced, often
unskilled,and frequently much less
reliable than other hired labor. It
often happens that a student who
knows how to do some particular
kind of work well, can not he found
easily by people wanting that kind
of work, and so loses his opportu
nity.
This year the committee has un
dertaken to register every student
who wishes to work, find out what
he can do best, and put him in
communication with the people
who want that particular kind of
work. The committee has been
able to till a number of positions in
Palo Alto satisfactorily, which
would have been tilled by outside
labor from San Francisco.
The committee can not succeed
without the co-operation both of the
people who want help and of the
students who want work. At the
present moment there are two places
for young women to earn board and
room for which no students have
been found. There is a surplus of
students wanting clerical labor,
as tvpe-writing, copying, and tutor
ing, and a dearth of people to do or
dinary housework.
The committee purposes to find
out how satisfactorily the students
have been able to do the work
which the)' have obtained, and will
endeavor to recommend to those
wishing to employ only those capa
ble of doing efficient and satisfac
tory work. People who want help
are urged to allow the committee to
supply them before going elsewhere,
and to report any unsatisfactory
service. The committee will facili
tate matters between employer and
student so that people may obtain
desired help without inconvenience.
The committee is composed of
Professors \V. R. Dudley (chair
man). J. O. Griffin, C. H. Wing, and
Mrs. M. R. Smith (secretary). Mrs.
Smith will hold office hours for the
committee in room 20 quad Mon
day and Wednesday at 9:30 a.m.
and Tuesday and Thursday at 10:30
a.m., and will be assisted by Dane
Coolidge, '98, who may be found at
room 85 Encina, or at the Camp.
