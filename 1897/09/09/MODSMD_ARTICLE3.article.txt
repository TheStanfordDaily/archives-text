# The
						'98 Annual Deficit.
## 
### 
It is reported that tlie Class of '98
will find a burden on its hands in
the liabilities of the Annual issued
last year. The amount of the in
debtedness is said to lie about $500,
but the assets can not yet be ascer
tained, as Manager Fred Ayer is
not in the University this year and
has made no final report. The
class, however, has a number of
books on hand which are yet new
to many, and should go a long way

toward meeting outstanding obliga
-1 tions. Manager Ayer is at present
' in Salt Lake City, Utali.
