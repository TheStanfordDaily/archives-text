# Summer Scientific Expeditions.
## 
### 
Several scientific expeditions were
made by various parties of Stan
ford professors and students during
the vacation.
While Dr. Jordan and his as
sistants were ii|> in the Bering Sea
concerned with the seals there, an
other party was investigating tlie
seals found on Guadalupe Island in
the southern seas. Dr. Thoburn
was sent, together with Professors
Wing and Green, by the United
States Fish Commission to investi
gate the fur-bearing seals found
there. Guadalupe Island is about
250 miles south of San Diego, and
about 150 miles off the Mexican
coast. It is twenty miles long and
five wide. The party was there ten
days and, although unable to ob
tain specimens of the seals, they col
lected much data concerning the
seals and gathered a great deal of
information about the island.

The seals are of a different species
from those found anywhere else in
the world, but they resemble those
of the Antarctic more than any
other. The herd is nearly extinct,
and it has not been determined
whether they have commercial
value or not.
Professor Green says that the
cypress trees of the island are the
same as the famous Monterey cy
press which had been supposed to
be confined exclusively to the lo
cality about Monterey and\ Pacific
Grove. The pine trees, he re
semble the famous Cedar of\Leb
anon. There are palm trees on\he
island, but all low shrubbery and
young growths are destroyed by the
goats which abound there.
Dr. Gilbert, with another party,
has been conducting an investiga
tion of the fishes of the streams along
the Pacific coast, collecting all the
new species with a view to explain
ing their relation to each other.
R. C. McGregor, '08, made a col
lection of fishes, birds, animals,
and plants, in the islands off the
coast of Lower California. His
party visited the islands of Guada
lupe, Carros, Socorro, and Clarion.
The trip was in every way success
ful. Among the specimens brought
back were 2,000 birds, 100 mam
mals, 15,000 plants, 500 reptiles,
and 500 fish.
