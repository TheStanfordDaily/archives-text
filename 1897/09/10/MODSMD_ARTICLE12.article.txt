In former years many young wo
men students, living off the campus,
have felt the need of a room in the
quadrangle .where all might luncli
in rainy weather or where an hour's
rest might be obtained. Last year
an attempt was made by the women
of the faculty, co-operating with
some of the students, to supply the
need, with not altogether gratifying
results. Mr. Hodges kindly loaned
for the purpose a small room near
the co-operative store, in which the
ladies placed the most necessary fur
niture. They then handed it over
to the students to do with as they
chose, and it was hoped that the
real need, if there was any, would
manifest itself bv the interest of the
young women. Although the ex
pense of maintaing such a room is
slight, Comparatively few took ad
vantage of the opportunity offered,
the few who did finding it very con
venient. The room used last year
is yet unoccupied and it might per
haps, if sufficient interest were
taken, be secured again forthesame
purpose. Some step, however, should
be taken at once as there is talk of
handing the room over to the Hy
giene depa rtnient.
