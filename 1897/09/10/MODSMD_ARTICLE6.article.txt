# FRESHMAN MEETING.
## New Class Organized After an Address by President Jordan. 
### 
The tirst meeting of the Class of
l.iOl was held in the chapel this
afternoon. There was an unusually
large attendance At the request
of President Schwartz of the Class
of '99, who called the meeting to
order, Dr. Jordan made a few re
marks to the members of the incom
ing class. He told them that there
was no disposition on the part of
the faculty here to interfere in any
way with the freedom of the stu
dents of the University. It de
sired, however, to keep the stand
ard of Stanford University high
and to admit into our midst only
those persons who were capable of
behaving as ladies and gentlemen.
He said that there was room in the
world for all kinds of people, but
that Stanford University wanted
only those people who would take
advantage of the opportunities it
had to offer; said that he was glad
to see the students discontinue the
annual inter-class rush, because re
ports of them kept many worthy
students away from the University
and tended to cast discredit upon
the good name of the institution.
President Schwartz then took the
chair and appointed Oliver Bradley
temporary secretary. He then
called for nominations for tempo
rary president. Messrs. Greely,
Whi tin ire, and Havens were nomi
nated. Mr. Greely withdrew, and
Mr. Whitinire was elected by a vote
of 46 to 41.
Upon taking the chair Mr. Whit
tling said that lie appreciated the
honor shown him, and would at once
see to committee appointments look
ing to the nomination of class of
ficers. The names of the commit
teemen appointed are published
elsewhere in today's Daily Palo
Alto. The meeting was then ad
journed.
