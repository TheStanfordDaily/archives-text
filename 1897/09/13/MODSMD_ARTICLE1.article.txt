ing by the crowd of collegians who

vania!" of the crowd was not up to
the Pennsylvania standard, but it
constituted a part of his greeting
Mr. Brooke had been met in San
Francisco Friday evening by a dele
gation of Stanford men, consisting
of Manager Switzer, Treasurer Pom
eroy, ex-Manager Dave Brown,
Charles K. Field, '95, Harrelson,
'95, and Sheehan, '95; and was es
corted to Palo Alto by this delega
tion, by whom also he was con
ducted over the campus and made
acquainted with many of his future
pupils.
Coach Brooke hails from New
Jersey, but prepared for college at
Sherwood Academy, Ind., where he
played on the "prep" team. He
entered Swarthniore College at the
age of fifteen, where he played on
the team for three years, the last
year as captain. While at Swarth
niore he was also a member of the
baseball, track, and tennis teams.
In 1893 Brooke received the degree
of B. S. from Swarthniore, and in
the fall of that year he entered the
University of Pennsylvania. He
made the team his first year and
played as fullback in the seasons of
1893, 1894,and 1895. In 1896 he was
debarred by Harvard from playing
on the four year rule, having played
at Swarthniore. Brooke made,
while on the team, thirteen field
goals in games during his last two
years of play. Brooke's playing
won him a place on Casper Whit
ney's All-Anierican team of 1893 as
sub-fullback, on the team of 1894 as
halfback, and on the 1395 team as
fullback.
During the last two years of
Brooke's play Pennsylvania did
not lose a game, defeating in 1894
Princeton, 12-0, and Harvard, 18-4.
In 1895 Brooke won the Harvard
game for Pennsylvania by kicking
a fiekj-goal, making the score 17-14.
Cornell was defeated 52-2.
Brooke has several interesting re
cords of his kicking. The longest
drop-kick made by him in a game
was 45 yds.; place kick, 40 yds.; J
punt, 72 yds. These kicks were all
measured, and there was no wind
in any case.
In 189b Mr. Brooke was graduated
from the Wharton School, U. of P.,
receiving the degree of Ph. B. He
is at present in the third year of J
the Pennsylvania law school. Last
year he coached the famous Carlisle
Indian team fora brief period be
fore one of their big games, and he
has also assisted in the coaching of
the Pennsylvania team.
Coach Brooke when seen today
by a representative of the Daily
Palo Alto was examining the new
football field in the company of
Manager Switzer and Captain Cot
ton. The field is very soft in some
places but will be sprinkled and
rolled as soon as possible.
Coach Brooke, in response to in
quiries, said that the preliminary
training wouid consist, for the first

at least, of only light work, punting,
catching, falling on the hull, run
ning, and signal practice. Both
tennis, the Varsity and the second
eleven, will have their codes and
will practice them daily. The Var
sity will at first consist of the old
men and promising subs. Later,
as the new men show up, they will
be placed on the Varsity if the}' de
serve it. The work for the present
will consist entirely of outdoor
work —no gymnasium work.
Mr. Brooke has not as vet seen
the men at practice, and conse
quently has formed no judgment as
to the material at hand for the
Va rsitv.
