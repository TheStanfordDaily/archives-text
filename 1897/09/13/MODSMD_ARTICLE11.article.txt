The football authorities made a
move in the right direction when
they made arrangements for the
erection of a permanent grandstand
near the football field which will
accommodate about five hundred
people. By thus enabling the spec
tators to sit in a compact mass,
the yelling and the organized dem
onstrations on the side-lines will be
rendered much more effective. It
will also encourage the feminine
football enthusiasts to grace the
bleachers more frequently and thus
encourage the team.
