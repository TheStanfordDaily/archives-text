Now that the date of Dr. Jordan's
lecture for the benefit of the '99 An
nual has been decided upon, every
meinJjer of the Class of '99 should
do everything possible to contribute
towards the success of the same-
Both the '97 and '98 Annuals left
their classes with large debts on
their hands. The Class of '99 will
make a strenuous effort to avoid
any such result. The manner in
which the students patronize Dr.
Jordan's lecture will do much to
promote the success or failure of

the '99 Annual and will serve to
encourage or dishearten the pro
moters of future Annuals.
