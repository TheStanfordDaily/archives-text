# SUNDAY SERMON.
## Horatio Stebbins Delivers an Eloquent Address in Our Chapel. 
### 
A large audience filled the chapel
on last Sunday morning. Horatio
Stebbins, 1). 1)., of San Francisco,
preached the sermon. Dr. Stebbins
took his text from Mark ix. '24:
'Lord, I believe; help Thou mine
unbelief."
"Where a man says anything, he
should say what be thinks, but not
necessarily all that lie thinks, li
is just so with belief. A man should
express what he believes, but not
necessarily all that he believes. All
great beliefs are poetic, but the aver
age practical man can not con
ceive this. The child believes with
out thinking.
"In these times when many forms
of belief are arising many doubts
are prevalent, and many people
change from one belief to another.
However there is always some dan
ger in changing base when beliefs
that have been cherished break
down. It is a great shock to the
mind of a person who has been ac
customed to regard truth, to find
that be has nothing in his hands,
and so flies to doubt as a refuge.
"Doubts are but a portion of our
beliefs and the}' need not be feared
by an honest soul. No great beliefs
are attained except through doubts.
What we want to do is to rise up to
the great and eternal belief.
"There are those who are per
plexed by doubt, and it is often a
comfort to them to know how they
became so Our sentiments are
stronger than our reason, and there
are some things that our healthy
moral instincts resent. By these
instincts we can elude the many
false religions. We often take on
strange conditions of morality and
try to believe that we do believe.
"Great belief does not come by
trying. It is the true grace of the
mind, and a remedy for doubt is a
believing mind —that sweet simpli
city of mind that brings God near.
There is nothing more natural than j
for men to plume themselves on 1
their religious doubts. This is the
conceit of scepticism. The only
remedy for such a state of mind is a
gentle humility, and it is as hard
to come to such a humility as to
come to intellectual simplicity.
"Young men and young women j
feel that their experience of religi- |
ous doubt is peculiar to themselves, j
but this is the same that it has al-1
ways been from generation to gen
eration. Doubts are a very small j
matter. Go to the foundation of
your natural piety and you will
touch sacred ground. There is a
wonderful power in pure veracity.;
"Nevertheless, doubt has a. place. !
All healthy minds have seasons of
suspense and to be always positive
is a sign of a weak and a barren
intellect. There is a time and place,
for doubt in all moral and spirit
ual things. Doubt must go!
wherever the mind goes.
"Never allow anyone to swerve
you from your religious belief. A
religious belief is healthy. A pri
mary truth is the reality of virtue.
To doubt that you area moral being
is worse than doubt. It is damn
ing yourself. This is not only in
human, but it is unhuman. Such
doubt is to be treated with decision,

as Jesus treated the devil. Jt is
most important for us to know the
seeds and germs of truth, and to let
them grow. J confess that lam a
little weary of the small talk of
truth. 1 want the truth of God in
the large—in thoughts that thread
the universe.
'•The simplest elements of religion
and virtue belong to you. They
are you. They are the things that
God knows you by. Look, 0 look,
and think. Take these great things
into your heart, and you will be
richer than all the world will make
you. Do not argue ahout praying,
but pray. The sun shines. Heboid
its deeds and walk in the light.
Stand on the rock of virtue. Trust
yourself, and trust God who made
you."
