# FOOTBALL PRACTICE
## Large and Lively Crowd of Spectators on the Field Last Night. 
### 
The practice yesterday afternoon
was characterized by briskness and
liveliness among both the players (
and spectators. This was caused
in all probability by the fact that
Mr. Brooke appeared on the field
for the first time as Varsity coach.
The men were active and willing,
and the spectators interested and
appreciative.
The practice consisted in the
main of punting and catching the
ball, and getting down the field on
punts. The men were divided into
three squads, which in turns charged i
down the field as the ball was
snapped back for punts This gave |
the men practice in following the
ball.
Those showing up best in punting
were Murphy, Fisher, and Beckett. I
Coach Brooke gave these men spec
ial coaching in punting. Murphy I
excelled in length of his punts, al- j
though his punting was slow J
Fisher's punts were long and
strong, but they were slow in ex- 1
ecution. Beckett lacked quickness.
Jeffs and Parker were the speediest {
in getting down on punts, Fickert i
did well fora heavy man. Some :
of the new men also were fleet-;
footed.
The old Varsity men out for
practice were Captain Cotton, Fick
ert, Carle, Thomas, Rice, Smith,
.Jeffs, Murphy, and Fisher. Among
the other men out were Mcintosh,
James, Adams, Beckett, Daly, Bal
lantyne, Parker, Rusk, McFadden,
Sayer, Houston, Biglow, Braden,
Collins, Thayer, Dole, and Oilman
So far no new candidates for
fullback have shown up very well,
and no very heavy men for the
freshman team. The U. C. fresh
men have a very heavy line and the
Stanford freshmen must be on the
lookout for heavy men.
