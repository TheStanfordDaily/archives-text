Yesterday's Daily ('alifarnini
reproduces a cut which was printed
recently at the head of a sensational
article in the Chicago Tiniis-JIcr
aid describing the atrocious deeds
committed in the late inter-class
rush at Berkeley. The mangled
body of young Kurtz —who was
really very badly injured in the
rush —was represented lyingagai nst
a tree. A band of sophomores was
dancing in high glee around him.
The picture makes them look more
like a, tribe of savage Jndians ready
to scalp their victim than like a
crowd of college students whose
training is supposed to make them
high-minded, gentle, and kind.
The article throughout is one of
gross exaggeration, and Editor
Checkering regrets that one of the
leading and most reliable papers of
the Kasl should have given it pub
lication. In this regret we are
sun that every Stanford student
will share. The article can not but
leave in the minds of many people
an erroneous idea of student life in
California. Hut il teaches us one
lesson: Kvery act of the college
student is closely watched by the
outside world, and he should be at
all times careful not to do any
thing which may by the mi si liter

name of an institution which repre

years of toil of noble souls is a
thing too sacred to he trampled
