# Football at U.C.
## 
### 
The U.C. football men have been
in training now for almost a month.
If there is any peculiar virtue in
taking time by the forelock, Berke
ley should surely accomplish won
ders.
The early training which the men
are undergoing is in accordance
with the policy which Coach Xott
and Captain Haskell have adopted.
Their object is first to put the men
through a course of training which
will harden them for severe work.
Secondly the men will receive coach
ing in their individual positions.
After this will come coaching in
teamwork and training in team
play.
The outlook of Berkeley seems to
warrant the prediction of a heavier
line than last year's, with backs of
average ability. The places of Ran
some and Sherman, who have grad
uated, will be the hardest to till.
Kennedy's place as quarter-back is
already satisfactorily filled l>v Cap
tain Haskell, who played in last
year's game after Kennedy's injury.
McNutt, end, will not return, but
there are plenty of good candidates
for this position.
Hall, halfback; Haskell, quarter
back; Craig, end; Greisberg and
Walthall, guards; Ludlow and Sim
gon, tackles, are the old men in

training thus far. There are rumors
that Plunkett, Berkeley's big guard,
and Simpson, tackle, will not cross
the bay to play this year, but it is
safe to count upon these men as
candidates. This leaves about the
only places to be tilled on the team
one end, one halfback, and a full
back.
Of last year's players there are
available Avery, Birdcall, and Mo
lera, for center; Castlehun and Mc-
Dermott, guards; Hopper, Allen,
Masters, and Kaarsberg, ends;
Barnes and Cornish, tackles.
Of the candidates for the U. C.
freshman team the candidates seem
to be promising, (iuiberson, a large
220-pound man, will play center or
guard on the team. McCabe, half
back, and I'ringle, tackle, of Oak
land, are good men. I'ringle weighs
180 pounds. Langon, the Reliance
end, has entered U. C Craig, the
0 11. S. guard, weighs 180 pounds.
Tolman, of the Pomona College
team, Kern, halfback on the Visa
lia High School team, are other
promising men. It is rumored that
Sheehy, the Olympia guard, has
entered Berkeley. Sheehy played
in vanity form.
