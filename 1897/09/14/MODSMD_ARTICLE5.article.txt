# THE 						CHORAL SOCIETY.
## James H. Howe of San Francisco Will Be the Society's New Leader. 
### 
James Hamilton Howe, the new
leader of the Choral Society, was for
ten years dean of the musical de
partment of DePauw University,
and has been engaged since his ar
rival in California, three years ago,
in the conduct of oratorial choruses
and orchestras. He is the leader of
choruses in San Francisco, San Jose,
Oakland, and Sacramento; and is
director of the California Music Fes
tival Association, an organization
which has for its object the pre
sentation of great choral works in
San Francisco every year.
Mr. Howe's musical experience is
ample for the work which he has
undertaken in the musical education
of California. Wherever he has
been a leader, he has won the per
sonal esteem and good will of his
chorus by his geniality and enthu
siasm. Mr. Howe is devoted to his
work and it is hoped that a large
and energetic chorus will support
his efforts here.
Professors Jenkins and Price were
colleagues of Mr. Howe at De Pauw,
where his efficiency as an organizer
and his energy in the management
of his department were soon recog
nized. Several of the members of
the University who were in his
chorus at San Jose speak in the
highest terms, and with the greatest
pleasure, of his work there.
The Choral Society will meet
this semester at 7:30 on Wednesday
evenings in the chapel. At the
next rehearsal several of the tflior
uses from"The Messiah" will be
practiced.
The amount of the fee for each
member of the society will depend
upon the number in the chorus.
It is hoped by a prompt registra
tion of as many names as possible
to make the fee two dollars or less.
