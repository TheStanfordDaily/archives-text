A laugh number of student body
assessments yet remain uncol
lected, although eveiy opportunity
has been offered students to pay it.
ll is lamentable inched thai it has
become necessary t<> plan a system
atic campaign for the collection of
the small fee asked of the students
to support athletics and moreespec
iallv to meet the immediate ex
penses of the football season. Those
who have responded voluntarily are
deserving of credit for the college
spirit of which we boast, and we
urge those who are asked to pay
their assessments bv the collectors

who are to be sent out to consider
the expenses to lie met within the
next few weeks and consequently
to pay up promptly. It has been
necessary to build a new grand
stand this year and the manage
ment has been compelled to buy
many new outfits on account of the
large number of men on the foot
ball field. The assessment is not
large and your√ü will help. (Jive it
promptly.
