# Reaction Against Democracy.
## 
### 
Professor C. A. Duniway deliv
ered a very entertaining lecture in
the chapel last evening on the '"Re
action against democracy."
Professor Duniway considered
first the types of American citizens
dangerous to democracy, the funda
mental not ions of democracy, aml
its present tendencies. The past
problem of democracy was to make
the government work well. That
has been solved; the American gov
ernment does work well. The fu
ture danger to American democracy
is through the power of the ''boss''
and corporate capital working
through the ''boss."
Professor Dimiway's text for the
evening was taken from Mr. Paul
L. FordV "Peter Sterling,''in which
he describes democrocy as a gov
ernment of the "average." The
conclusion reached in the lecture
was that the future of democracy
was safe because the people as a
whole know what they wish, and
because the classe? of society are so
interdependent that one class can
not afford to wreck the interests of
another.
Mr. Duniway's reasoning was
clear and acute, as well as sympa
thetic with his subject. The above
brief abstract does not reveal the
interesting character of the lecture.
