# Sermons by Professor Warner.
## 
### 
Beginning with next Sunday
Prof. Warner will deliver a course
of four "Sermons from Social
Science." The titles of the several
sermons will be as follows: (1) "In
default of demonstration"; (2) "The

triumph of evil"'; (3) "When
changes come"; (4) "Vicarioussac
rifice." The sermons were planned
and will he delivered as a series, al
though each has a unity of its own.
The first explains the rather nar
row limitations of formal demon
stration as a guide to conduct, es
pecially in social affairs; thesecond
canvasses the possibility of general
social shipwreck; the third con
siders some of the duties of the in
dividual to the social mechanism of
which he forms a part; and the
fourth attempts to give a basis of
observed facts to certain doctrines
that are commonly supposed to
rest exclusively upon religious
dogma.
