I nli attendance at the Univer
sity lectures given on Tuesday
evening of each week has been good
While this is very gratifying at
present, it would he still more so il
interest in this series of lectures
could be kept up throughout the
year. Jt is in reality a general
University .course in which every
student who is alive to his best in
terests is supposed to register, it is
a course of lectures which can not
help having a broadening influence,
which will relieve the dangerous
effects of over-specialization in Un
viersity work.
