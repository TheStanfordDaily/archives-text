# ARMY-NAVY DISBANDS.

A Leading Team Withdraws from the
League Because of Disagreement.
The Army-Navy team, which
promised to be one of the best teams
in the league this year, disbanded
last evening. The cause was the
opposition of the Olympic players
to the introduction of privates from
the army into the training squad.
Last year's Olympic team was
not open to the competition of pri
vates and the Olympic players of
last year's team who had joined
forces with the Army-Navy aggre
gation saw no reasons why privates
should play in the team. Lieuten
ant Roederer, manager of the Army-
Navy team, had in view some large,
healthy privates, who he thought
might learn the game. This caused
the trouble. The Olympics thought
themselves too good to associate
with privates in the army.
Last evening the Olympic men
decided to draw out from the team.
Captain Percy Morse resigned and
the team is no more. The disrup
tion of this team will ha ve a serious
effect on the varsities of Stanford
and U. C. as it will again disar
range the schedule of games which
had been arranged.
