Through the kindness of Mr.
Kasson, editor of the iPalo Alto Lire
Oak, we have had the privilege of
looking over the advance sheets of
the special edition of that paper
which is to appear next week. It
is to he a handsomely illustrated
number and as a souvenir it will
be invaluable to every student.
Those who have just come to the
University who desire to send
something to their friends to givt
them an idea of the surroundings
here, can do no better than to se
cure a few extra copies of this
edition for that purpose. Orders
for the paper may he left at the
Universitv Bookstore.
