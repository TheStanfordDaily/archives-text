About two o'clock this afternoon
the boiler-house whistle blew the
(ire-alarm, it being reported Unit
l'ine Cottage was on lire. Fortun
ately the alarm was a false one:
but had there really been ;i fire on
the campus it would have taken
several minutes for the crowd
which gathered to decide just what
to do. We are perhaps not so well
prepared for fire as we should be.
It would not take long fora fire to
play havoc among the frame build
ings of the campus unless met
speedily and effectively by a well
organized force. Some thought
should be given in advance to the
possibility of having to meet an
emergency of this kind. Otherwise
it will one dav take us unawares.
