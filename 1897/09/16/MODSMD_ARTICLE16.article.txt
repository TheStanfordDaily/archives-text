At a time when the management
is sorely pressed for funds to buy
football outfits and meet other ab
solutely necessary expenses, it is
the positive duty of every one to
pay his or her dues to the student
body promptly. In this matter no
one should consider himself exempt
or entitled to special privileges.

Jf any difference were to be made
at all, one would expect to pee those
who are most interested in our ath
letics and other activities take the
lead in the matter and set an ex
ample hy prompt payment. If the
members of the Executive Commit
tee, the football men, or the staff of
the Daily Palo Alto were to neg
lect their student body assessments,
how could the other students of the
University be expected to he prompt
in furnishing the means for carry
ing on the work of preparing for
another football victory?
