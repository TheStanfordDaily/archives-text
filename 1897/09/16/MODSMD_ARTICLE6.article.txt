# OUR ALUMNI AT FRESNO.
## Stanford Is Well Represented in the Schools of Central California. 
### 
The Class of '95 is pretty well
represented in Fresno, which, by
the way, is the exact geographical
center of California. Lewis Smith,
who, as a collegian was class base
ball manager, treasurer of the Y.
M. C. A., president of the Republi
can Club, and chairman of the Sen
ior Day committee, is city attorney
and is junior partner in a promi
nent law firm of Fresno. Jones, of
San Jose, is at the head of the de
partment of mathematics,and Miss
Su-sanah Cory, of San Jose, at the
head of the department of English i it
tle high school. Donohoo, ex-'95,
who was a boxer here in the early
days of the University, is president
of the Fresno Athletic Club and one
of the proprietors of a cyclery. in
addition to these Pioneers, Bier
man,'97, is teaching German in
the Fresno high school. The intro
duction of this "streak of cardinal"
into the Fresno high school is due
primarily to the loyalty of Lewis
Smith, who is very popular in his
own town. Over a year ago, partly
through his efforts, a principal an
tagonistic to Stanford was replaced
by one neutral with respect to the
two universities. The first result
was the entrance of Jones, '95, as a
teacher last year. The two other
Stanford teachers have just been
employed.
