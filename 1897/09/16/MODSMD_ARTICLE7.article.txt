# Last Night's Practice.
## 
### 
The football practice last night
was the hardest work the men have
yet had. After giving especial at
tention to Beckett's and Fisher's
punting, Coach lirooke lined up the
squad and had them fall on the
ball for fifteen minutes. lie then
divided the players into squads of
four and sent them down the Held
under kicks. Beckett and Fisher
alternated in punting. Captain
Cotton, Daly, Wilson, 11. E. Smith,
Fisher, and Scoville were detailed
to catch the punts and run the ball
back.
Varsity, second team, and fresh
men were slow in getting down with
the ball. Often the man who caught
the ball would, gel underway before
he was downed by the runners.
Smith, '99, and Wilson, 01, showed
up well in catching and handling
punts. It is evident, however, that,
the other men, who received, have
not yet acquired their usual form.
The Varsity was well represented,
Murphy being the only absentee.
The entire squad numbered thirty
six.
