Some of that spirit exists still at
Stanford which gives vent to itself
upon every occasion in which its
presence should not be manifested.
Of late it has been present on the
sidelines of the football field and
has consisted in laughing at men
who were striving to do their best,
but who perhaps have not yet
learned the ways of a football
player. It does the men no great
harm, but the spirit is not the true
Stanford spirit. We dislike to see
it exhibited here.
