The matriculation at Berkeley of
Sheehy, the Olympic guard of last
season, raises the question of his
eligibility to the freshman team.
He spent two or more years at
Santa Clara College and received
some credit for that work upon en
tering at Berkeley. It is almost a
certainty that lie will be on the
Thanksgiving team. Whether or
not that has been the main reason
for his suddenly entering Berke
ley at this particularly opportune
time can better be determined next
term when his services will have

ceased to be immediately necessary.
Meanwhile the situation presents a
problem in football ethics.
