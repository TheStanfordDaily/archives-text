Many a new student coming here
from Eastern institutions, or even
from our sister college at Berkeley,
has expressed annoyance when en
tering the Stanford library, to find
no corner where absolute quiet pre
vails. In such a library as ours,
where space is limited so that many
students must necessarily work at
one long table, it seems but right
and courteous that each one should
endeavor to choose such a time and
place to talk with his friends that
others need not be disturbed
thereby. The earnest student is
much hampered when trying to
master a page of Stubbs or of Hor
ace by hearing on his left a conver
sation intermingled with exclama
tions and giggles in regard to the
latest party, while on his left he
may be hearing all the details of
last night's football or a descrip
tion of the latest pretty girl; and
such a person's peace of mind is
further destroyed to find upon
leaving the room that someone's
fountain pen has been energeti
cally flirted and that his clothes
have received the fugitive ink. A
liitle forethought on the part of the
young men and women of the Uni
versity might alter somewhat the
unenviable reputation we have for
bad, extremely bad, library man
ners.
