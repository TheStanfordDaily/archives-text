A large number of men turned
out for work on the gridion yester
day. All of the old Varsity and
nearly all of last year's second
eleven men were on the lield, as
well as a large number of the new
men.
Coach Brooke divided the men
into three sections and set them to
work falling on the ball for about
ten minutes. After this squads of
six were sent down the lield under
kicks, Beckett, Murphy, and Coach
Brooke doing most of the punting.
Beckett was very slow, allowing the
tacklers to beat the ball down the
field in many instances. Murphy
kicked both stronger and quicker.
The catching throughout was
very poor, caused in part by the
slowness in punting. Wilson showed
up very well among the new men
and Jeffs tackled in old-time form.
The first accident of the year oc
cured when Smith broke bis nose.
Mr. Brooke has materially changed
the style of punting and it will he
some days before the backs obtain
very good form. The field is soft
but in very good condition for this
part of the season's work. The
bleachers will be finished in a few
days and the spectators will be able
to commence systematic rooting.
