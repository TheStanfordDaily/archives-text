tilled "A brief history of currency
in Japan," which shows consider
able knowledge and careful study

After noting the use of rice as
currency down to the seventh cen
tury when copper began to be
coined, Abe takes lip the history of
gold and silver money in Japan
and traces the difficulties en
countered with reference to these
metals and paper money down to
the present time, lie shows why
bimetallism must be a failure in a
small country like Japan. He eu
logizes the effect of the silver regime
that has existed in Japan during
the hist two decades upon manufac
tures, commerce, and wages, and is
apparently suspicious of the result
of the law of 181)7 which establishes
a gold standard.
