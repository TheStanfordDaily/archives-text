# Stanford Archery Club.
## 
### 
That Stanford will have an arch
ery club now seems an assured fact.
Mr. Havens, '01, who is archery
champion of California, is the pro
moter of the plan. Both President
and Mrs. Jordan have spoken favor
ably of the project. Dr. Wood re
gards it as a heathful form of exer
cise and has given his approval of
the sport. Thus far about fifty stu
dents have agreed to join the club
when it shall be formed.
The ranges will be situated in the
excavation between Encina and the
quad. There is room in this exca
vation for six targets at the stand
ard American range. The targets
will be placed on the side toward
Encina and canvas stretched
above to catch the arrows. In the
intervals between football, track ath
letics, and baseball this sport will
no doubt afford a chance for health
ful exercise.
