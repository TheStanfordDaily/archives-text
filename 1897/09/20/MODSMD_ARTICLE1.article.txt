# A
						SERMON TO STUDENTS.
## An Unusually Interesting Discourse by Dr. Amos G. Warner. 
### 
A large audience gathered in the
chapel yesterday morning to hear
Dr. Warner's lirst sermon upon the
subject, "In default of demonstra
tion." He spoke in part as follows:
"In the social sciences formal
demonstration is usually out of the
question. We deal not with axioms
and demonstrations, but with a
calculus of relative probabilities.
Formal demonstration plays and
can play but a small part in es
tablishing the conclusions upon
which conduct is based. We act
and must act largely upon instinct,
upon probabilities, upon 'the sub
stance of things hoped for the evi
dence of things not seen.' Only
children can properly permit them
selves to lie afraid of the dark. It is
the common business of men to go
forward into it â€”carrying as good a
lantern of demonstration as may be
at the time available, but anyhow
going forward.
"The members of an institution
of learning are constantly urged to
reason about things, to think things
out, to rationalize their lives. The
advice is good, but it must be fol
lowed none the less guardedly.
While the average man may think
too little, there are students who,
like Hamlet, think too much. At
least they do thinking that better
not be done. They reason about
things until they forget to obey in
stincts that have firmer foundations
than their reasoning, and they
come to value intellectual certainty
so highly that they are paralyzed
in the numberless cases when it is
not to be reached. The intellect is
such a splendid tool and they have
learned to use it so deftly that they
forget that there is any work to
which it is not suited. It is our
present purpose to remind our
selves of some things the intellect
is not good for, of certain ways in
which this most invaluable tool is
abused by over-use.
"1. Students commonly make
great mental efforts to solve prob
lems that none of the giants of
philosophy have heretofore been
able to solve. There is no particu
lar harm in this. To rake up all
the insoluble problems of philoso
phy and try to solve them is even a
useful form of exercise. It helps in
the development of immature intel
lects, as biting on hard rubber helps
the baby in the development of im
mature teeth. The danger is that,
like Hamlet, we will take our spec
ulation too seriously, or imagine it
necessary to reach intellectual cer
tainty before we do what we in
stinctively realize to be our duty.
Dr. Arnold, afterwards of Rugby,
became deeply involved in the con
siderations of these everlasting
enigmas when he was a young man
at the university. He raised such
a swarm of difficulties and doubt
that his friends said: 'We must get
him away from the university and
the constant temptations to medita
tion which it affords. Hard work
is what he needs. When he is busy
he will be all right.' And he was.
That is the solution of the insoluble
which most of us have to accept.
Is life worth living? Live and find
out. Is the will free? See how

large a share of independence you
can conquer for yourself. Ilow did
evil get into the world? See what
you can do to get some of it out.
Think, hut do not let your life 'he
come sicklied o'er with the pale
cast of thought.' Beware lest the
rubber ring on which it was good
to bite becomes a file on which it is
fatal to gnaw.
'"2. A second way in which we
overuse our intellects is by trying
to make them do the work belong
ing to instincts which might much
better be trusted. The man who
doubts his mother's love and seeks
reassurance in the syllogism will
not find it. 'You can not,' asserts
an evangelistic minister, 'get into
heaven head first,' and certainly
many of the best things of this
world can not be reached by reason
ing one's way towards them. Love,
friendship, honesty, purity, courage:
the man is not fortunate who must
seek to enter into these things by
ratiocinative processes. We must
perforce rationalize large depart
ments of our Pves. Let us not
waste energy in rationalizing de
partments that can safely be left to
the management of spontaneous
and healthful instincts.
"Why is it that college graduates
have to be trained all over again be
fore they make good business men?
Largely because in addition to the
technical knowledge they must ac
quire there is a further need of their
learning to rely upon their instincts.
The business man learns to judge
associates, acquaintances, compet
itors, applicants for positions, ap
plicants for credit, on very, very
meager information, and after a few
words exchanged with them. The
searching look, the well put ques
tion, give him his cue, and he fol
lows his instincts without waiting
for demonstration. Jf his instincts
are correct he is a successful busi
ness man; if not he goes to the wall.
The man who is most likely to come
to all he was meant for, is he who
can reason both formally and in
formal!)'; who has the patience to
achieve demonstration when it is
attainable and the courage to act
without it when it is not.
"3. In matters of social reform
the scholar is too apt to be the ob
stinate or timorous conservative.
There seem to be two leading rea
sons why scholarly people are in
clined to an ultra and unhealthful
conservatism. The first is that
their reasoning faculties have often
been developed at the expense of
their sympathies. In one of
Charles Kingsley's fairy stories there
is a giant who is described as hav
ing a heart, 'though it was consid
erably over-grown with brains.'
The same malformation is to be ob
served in many individuals and
some periodicals that pride them
selves on being scholarly or scienti
fic. A wise reviewer of the career
of Gladstone says:
"'Poetical sympathies are cer
tainly not infallible in politics, but
in great emergencies they are of
ten surer guides than the average
conclusions of the intellect. For
poetic feeling is a form of truth, and
reasons well though it dispenses
with the syllogism.'
"The second and most important
