A suggestion was made at the
meeting of the Ju.iior Class this af
ternoon which we believe to be a
good one. It is suggested that in
stead of the gray ping usually worn
by junior classes a Spanish som
brero be adopted by this year's Jun
ior Class. This suggestion conies
from members of the alumni and is
urged because the Spanish style of
sombrero would be in keeping with
the Spanish style of architecture
and the general tone and surround
ings of the University. The som
brero could also be worn hv the
young women and become a
thoroughly distinct class mark.
