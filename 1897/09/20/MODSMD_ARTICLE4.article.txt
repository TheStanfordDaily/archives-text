# New League Schedule.
## 
### 
The withdrawal of the Army-
Navy team from the football league
has necessitated the revision of the
schedule of games. The Reliance
team will (day the games which had
been arranged for the Army-Navy
team. Following is the revised
schedule:
Oct. '2 —U. C. vs. Reliance.
Oct. 9 —Stanford vs. Reliance.
Oct. 10— U. C. vs. Reliance.
Oct. '23—Stanford vs. Reliance
Oct. 30 —Stanford '01 vs. U.C.'Ol.
Nov. 6 —IJ. C. vs. Reliance.
Nov. 13 —Stanford vs. Reliance.
Nov. 25 —Stanford vs. U. C.
The date of November 20, on
which Reliance and the Army-
Navy were to contest, is thus left
vacant. A game for that date will
be arranged by Reliance with the
Multnomah Club team of Portland
or one of the Chicago teams.
