Every member of the Class of
'99 should feel himself particularly
delegated to aid in the success of
Dr. Jordan's lecture next Friday
evening for the benefit of the '99
Annual. The last two AnnualÂ®
have been financial failures. The
members of the Class of '99
should see to it that the success of
their year-book is not marred by
any financial loss. Such losses al
ways fall heavily upon a class in
its senior vear.
