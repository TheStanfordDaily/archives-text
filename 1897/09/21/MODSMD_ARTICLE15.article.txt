THe present Freshman Class
must awaken some of its class spirit
and energy if a creditable showing
is to be made in its contest with the
U. C. freshmen this year. Not
enough men are out at the Fresh
man practices. The members of
the class as a whole seem utterly
indifferent to the success of their
team, and have done little or
nothing to encourage their football
men. If the class would only wake
up to the fact that in almost a
month its team will meet its oppo
nents on the gridiron, perhaps the
enthusiasm of its numerous mem
bers would carry its team on to vic
tory.
