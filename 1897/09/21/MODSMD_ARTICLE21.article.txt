The Choral Society was estab
lished two years ago in the belief
that there was a place for such an
organization in the life of the I Di
versity. All of the other musical
societies are necessarily limited in
number, and draw their member
ship from those students who have
more than ordinary musical talent
and education. The Choral Society
was intended to appeal to the mu
sical capabilities which are pos
sessed by the great majority of peo
ple. The plan of the association is
to draw in a large body of music
lovers who are without training or
unusual musical gifts, and by
uniting their energies with more
skillful musicians, to produce re
sults beyond the power of either
class alone.
The Choral Society is essentially
democratic. It is intended to unite
the powers of those who are skilled
and trained with those who are un
skilled and untrained and who pos
sess capacities of execution and
enjoyment beyond what they
themselves are conscious of. A
great university is a jÂ»1 ace where
the development of the artistic
tastes is as important as is the ac
quisition of knowledge or the power
of thought.
The membership in such an or
ganization offers a musical educa
tion of great value, and at the ex
pense of little time and money.
The intimate acquaintance with the
noble works of art, practiced in the
Choral Society, is a liberal educa
tion in itself. Besides this, the
training to read music at sight, and
the development of the voice, are
quickly attained in choral practice
Many persons overestimate the
difficulty of the music likely to be
practiced by the chorus. Though
noble and serious it must be simple
fora society constituted like this
one. The oratorial choruses of the
great masters which will be prac
ticed by the society this year are
invariably full of life and spon
taneity.
The interest of this work can be
appreciated only by those who have
had experience in it. A unison
with others takes away self-con
sciousness, and gives a sense of
strength. A free expression of ex
alted feeling through great music is
a delight; and a growing power of
the sense of appreciation inspir
ing. Modern education is bookish
and analytic. It needs to be sup
plemented by free self-expression,
combined with sport. The pursuit
of athletics lills this place in some
degree, but the element of beauty
needs to be added. Pleasure with
beauty is most easily obtained in
music.
The plan of the Choral Society is
to have musical solos or some liter
ary entertainment in the intermis
sion of each meeting, making the
weekly rehearsal of the association
throughout a time of pleasant and
elevating enjoyment.
