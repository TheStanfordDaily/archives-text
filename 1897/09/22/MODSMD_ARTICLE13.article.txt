Editor Chickening of the Cali
fornian recently outlined his policy
with reference to the Stanford pa
pers. After asserting his intention
to avoid quarrels with the other
papers of the University of Califor
nia as inconsistent with the dignity
of the paper and harmful to the in
terests of his university, he contin
ued: "This same policy we intend
to pursue with respect to the Stan
ford papers. We shall try to avoid
petty squabbling with them for the
same reason, namely the smallness
and foolishness of it. College stu
dent publications merely succeed in
making themselves the laughing
stock of outsiders by giving way to
such foolish squabbling. It makes
news for the city newspaper corre
spondents, and by them alone is it
really welcomed."
The editorial policy of the Daily
Palo Alto is entirely in accord
with that of the Californian. Con
troversies between the papers of the
two universities can do no good,
and may only serve to lessen the
cordial relations of the two institu
tions. The Daily Palo Alto will
not take the initiative in stirring up
a war of ink between the journals
of California and Stanford.
