—Professor James Hanson of the
University of Wisconsin has been
appointed by Librarian Young to
be chief of the catalogue depart
ment of the Congressional Library.
McKendree University, which
conferred the degree of LL. I), upon
President McKinley, owes its cor
porate existence to Abraham Lin
coln. The charter was written and
introduced in the Illinois legislature
by Mr. Lincoln in 1854, and when
put upon its passage it went
through by the casting vote of Mr.
Lincoln.
—Rene Doumic, the literary
critic of the Revue des, Deux-Mondes,
has been engaged by the Cercle
Francaise de l'Universite Harvard,
a literary and dramatic society of
the undergraduates, to give a course
of lectures on French literature un
der its auspices before Harvard
University during the coming aca
demic year.
—The Hartford Times says that
a number of Vale undergraduates
who are working their way through
college have remained in New
Haven since commencement. Seven
of them have found places on the
electric car lines, either as motor
men or as conductors. They have
comparatively easy and regular em
ployment, satisfactory )>ay, and the
places are, so far as the hot weather
is concerned, as comfortable as any
other employment that could be
found.
—Washington and Lee Univer
sity, while one of the soundest of
Southern institutions, has only a
productive endowment of $650,000.
Washington's gift of $50,000 re
mains intact, and yields an annual
income of $3,000. It is the only
educational institution in the South,
excepting Tulane University, which
is not under state or sectarian con
trol. Under the presidency of
William L. Wilson, who has re
cently taken the office, its future is
very bright.
