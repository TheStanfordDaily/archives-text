# "Senior" Thoburn's Committee.

### 
An example of how reports of
University affairs become distorted
as the}' travel may he found in the
following item which was recently
printed in Ihirper's Weekly:
"The students of Stanford Uni
versity must enjoy popular govern
ment in an unusual and interest
ing degree. Word comes of a letter
that was issued a fortnight ago by
President Jordan to a Mr. Thorburn,
described as a Senior and 'chair
man of the student body that is
entrusted with the regulation of
undergraduate affairs. Dr. Jordan
informs Mr. Thorburn that there are
more applications to enter the Uni
versity than can he granted, and
that the faculty can waste no effort
on the idle, the dissipated, and the
undeserving. Then reminding hint
that 'it is part of the duty of your
committee to eliminate unworthy
persons from the rolls of University
classes,' he says:
" 'it is desired that you should
exercise this authority not only on
those found guilty of specific acts of
immorality, but on any whose per
sonal influence is objectionable. It
is desirable also that you should
look somewhat to the welfare of stu
dents who subject themselves to un
usual privations.'
"Senior Thorburn and his fellow
committeemen ought to have sala
ries, as perhaps they do. There
have been cases in the Eastern col
leges where specific misconduct has
been dealt with by undergraduates
and offenders dismissed, but an un
graduate commission empowered
and expected to dismiss the idle and
undeserving, and to see that the
studious are not overworked or un
derfed, is a novel tv."
