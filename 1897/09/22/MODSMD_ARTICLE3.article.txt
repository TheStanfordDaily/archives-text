Football Manager Everett Brown
recently discussed the football pros
pects at Berkeley with a represent
ative of the Californian. lie said
in part:
"The material that we have is
slightly above the average of past
years. The method that is being
pursued with our team is most cer
tainly an improvement over that
of any former year. California has
always had her strongest team
about October 15, but I believe that
this year we will play our best
game on Thanksgiving Day.
"The chances on that day is an
other matter. We must remember
that Leland Stanford Jr. has still
that 20-0 team, with what I con
sider to be some improvements on
it. So, really, no matter how hard
we work, it seems like going up
against irresistible odds, Do not

understand me to say we are beaten,
for California is going in to win.
"One factor generally in our favor
is the over-confidence of Leland
Stanford .Jr. They have caught the
Eastern fever from Stanford '97
Track Team and are now making
arrangements for football games in
Chicago during the winter."
The men now on the Varsity
squad at U. C. are: Sheehy. Pringle,
I'reno, Spence, McDermott, Cornish,
Dickson, Wolf, Ellis, Barnes, Greis
berg, Hall, Haskell, Hopper, and
Ludlow. If these men do not keep
up to their best form even fora day
they will be dropped from their po
sitions. Coach Nott will now de
vote his entire attention to the
squad, and will be assisted by Hunt
Pierce, Hutchinson, and Taylor. A
game will be played every Wed
nesday with Reliance.
