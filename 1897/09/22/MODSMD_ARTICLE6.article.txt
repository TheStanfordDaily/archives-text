# Dr. Jordan to Go East.
## 
### 
President Jordan and his secre
tary George A. Clark will soon leave
to attend the conference of the Inter
national Seal Fishery Commission
in Washington, 1). C., on October
10. Dr. Jordan was in the city
yesterday preparing for his depart
ure.
On the Commission the United
States will he represented by C. S.
Hamlin, John \\ . Foster, and Pres
ident Jordan. England will be rep
resented by Prof. 1). W. Thomp
son, James M. McColm, and Sir
Julian Pauncefonte. Japan and
Russia are also represented in the
conference. In all probability a
treaty will he signed which will set
tle the question of protecting the
seal herds.
Dr. Jordan has taken the stand
that rather than see the seal herds
exterminated lie prefers to see them
pass into the possession of Eng
land. He is also in favor of having
the sessions of the Com mission secret
and keeping no record of the debates,
as he believes that will facili
tate the work of the Commission as
well as avoid further diplomatic
complications.
