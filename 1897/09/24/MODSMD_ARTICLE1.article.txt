# VARSITY PRACTICE.
## Already the Football Squad Begins to Show Signs of Improvement. 
### 
The football practice of yesterday
was of the average order. Some of
the men played in Varsity form,
while others were far below it. The
progress thus far has been good.
Cotton, Daly, Wilson, and Murphy
made good runs for the \ arsity.
McFadden, Maytham,and Wyckoff
distinguished themselves on the
second eleven by their clever
tackling.
The early part of the afternoon
was devoted by Coach Brooke to
the Freshman team. The prospects
for the team can not yet be deter
mined. The line will lie light, but
it may make up for it in quickness.
Wyckoff and Wilson, back of the
line, are above the usual order of
freshman backs. Weatherwax at
quarter is not yet in form. Two
scrub teams lined up and practiced
fora short time before Varsity
practice.
The practice of the Varsity con
sisted mainly of formation for kick
offs and interference after the kick
off. Murphy and Cotton worked
well together, and made some good
runs. There seems to be as yet a
great hesitancy on the part of some
of the men in taking the ball if it
comes near them. Some also hes
itate in getting into the play.
The Varsity and second eleven
lined up for about twenty minutes.
The Varsity had the ball most of
the time and had no trouble in
making gains. There seems to be
a dearth of heavy men for the sec
ond eleven this year. The inter
ference of the Varsity was poor.
McFadden had no trouble in get
ting through it and tackling the
man with the ball. This lie did
repeatedly and won some well de
served applause from the bleachers.
Maytham also tackles well, and also
Wyckoff, who made several tackles.
The Varsity was given little oppor
tunity of showing its defensive
work.
Daly and Wilson on the Varsity
made several good runs in spite of
the loose interference. Murphy
handled punts well, and also kicked
well. Wyckoff handles his punts
very poorly at present. The prac
tice" was on the whole good, and the
men show signs of improvement.
The line-up was as follows:
