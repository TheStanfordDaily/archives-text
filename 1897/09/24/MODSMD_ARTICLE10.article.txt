The football management has
erected steps at the end of the new
grandstand for the convenience of
those who desire to take places upon
the higher tiers of seats after the
lower ones are taken. A great many
persons seem not to understand the
purpose of these steps, and so they
are blockaded daily and are useless
for the purpose for which they were
intended. _
