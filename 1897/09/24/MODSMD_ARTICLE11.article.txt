The right to the book-shelves in
the Library is a privilege which
those carrying on individual or re
search work can not well do with
out, and it seems too bad and en
tirely contrary to the spirit of our
institution that we have to be re
minded that we are abusing it.
Those who have taken the trouble
to read what is printed on the back
of the permit cards already know
the rule, but the experience of the
last four weeks shows that it has
been disregarded. Those to whom
special library privileges have been
extended should be sure that they
use them honorably, and it is the
duty of the entire student body to
see that an unfair advantage is not
taken in the matter.
