Although a notice was posted
last year by President Jordan di
recting that pedestrians only take
the left hand path from the Uni
versity to Palo Alto and that the
one on the right Vie used exclusively
by wheelmen, and although such
instructions have been repeatedly
referred to through the columns of
both this paper and (he Sequoia,
students will persist in disregarding
all attempts on the part of every
body to increase the safety and
usefulness of these two paths. Per
haps they do it willfully; perhaps
they do not not care; perhaps they
either do not think or do not know:
we will assume that the latter only
is true, and herewith repeat the
suggestion formerly made, that
signs directing travellers to the
proper path be put up at both ends of
the paths. To show that we have
the eournge of our eonviotinns, we

will agree to apply any small dona
tions those interested may wish to
place in our care, to providing these
signs, we of course doing our share,
and when provided we will see that
they are properly placed.
