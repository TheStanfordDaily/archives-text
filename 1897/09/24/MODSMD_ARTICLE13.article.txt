Stanford students who have oc
casion to show strangers through
our arboretum are sometimes over
come when they are asked the name
of every one of the hundreds of dif
ferent trees to be found there. Some
visitors are surprised that with so
large a collection of the trees of dif
ferent parts of the world more at
tention is not paid to learning the
names and other things of interest
about each one. In many parks
and gardens the names of all trees
and plants are plainly displayed.
This same plan might be followed
out here at slight expense. The de
partment of Botany should cer
tainly be the one to take the initia
tive in the matter, but we are sure
that the students in every depart
ment would t;ike an interest in the
movement if once started.
