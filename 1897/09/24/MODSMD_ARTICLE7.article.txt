The concert which the Hext Com
pany gives has received universal
praise from competent musical
critics and from the leading news
papers of the country. The Chi
cago Tribune said of a concert re
cently given in Chiciigo:
"The Hext Company and Wal
ther, the famous Belgian violinist,
gave an unusually fine performance
last evening to a packed house.
Effie Elaine Ilext portrayed five of
Shakespeare's famous women in
costume. Her Ophelia was the
strongest number, and in this char
acter her work equaled the efforts
of our most prominent actresses —
not excepting Modjeska. Her work
on the readings of Modern Authors
was talented and intelligently exe
cuted, and her statuesque poses a
wonderful exhibition of pantomime.
Walther exceeded expectation. He
is a soulful player and has a most
romantic history. lie is the only
violinist since Ole Bull's time who
has succeeded in pleasing the
masses."
The Spokane Spokesman-Review
of February 25, 1896, has the fol
lowing criticism of Walther:
"Walther's opening tones of De
Beriot's 'Scenes de Ballet' gave evi
dence of great things, and the aud
ience listened entranced as the Ger
man wizard's fingers wandered up

I and down the strings. There was
something charming in the pose of
the man, and his quaint Teutonic
genuflexion as he came forward to
the footlights appealed sympathiz
ingly to his hearers. There was no
lack of applause when he had fin
ished. It was spontaneous and
earnest. The response brought the
intermezzo from 'Cavalleria Rus
ticana,' admirably phased and su
perbly played. . . . One may
have heard many great violinists,
and then not have heard one who
plays so well as Walther."
The Evening Telegram of Port
land, Or., a paper noted for the
soundness of its criticism, said on
March 9, 1897, of Miss Hext:
"Miss Ilext's first number —a
humorous bit from Barrie —pro-
nounced her a reader of rare
declamatory ability and dramatic
force. She handled the difficult
Scottish dialect with deftness, and
her facial eloquence made intelligi
ble much of it that requires trans
lation when conveyed in cold type.
Then she gave an impersonation,
in costume, of Cleopatra, and her
tragic lines were delivered no less
effectually than the Gaelic patter.
Her Ophelia was fascinatingly
grewsome, and her .Juliet brought
hearty plaudits from the many
Shakespearean students in the
house. 'When Jack Comes Late'
was neatly read and acted, and the
Grecian posings were beautiful pic
tures artistically displayed. Miss
Hext is a handsome woman as well
as a highly talented elocutionist,
and if she ever enters the regular
dramatic field the world will hear
of her. There is no actress before
the American public today who
eclipses her in the qualifications of
stage presence and intellectuality."
In addition to these performers
Professor Holub, a talented artist
on the piano, is a member of the
company. The whole entertain
ment is sure to meet with the great
est applause.
