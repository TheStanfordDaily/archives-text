# "THE TRIUMPH OF EVIL."
## Dr. Warner Preaches the Second of His Sermons to Students. 
### 
The following is an abstract of
Professor Warner's second lecture,
which was delivered yesterday
morning.
"The new pathology of the medi
cal schools has many suggestions
for the student of sociology. There
used to be much talk about the via
medicatrix Aaturuthe healing
power of nature. It was thought
that nature had some special liking
for mail, and would keep him in
health if he would let her. It is
now known that nature is on both
sides of the battle. She gives man
organs and instincts that preserve
him at one time and destroy him at
another. She prods him forward
to a precipice and if he has not
skill enough to get down it safely
she simply drives on more men till
she happens on some who have that
skill More than this, the new path
ology lias shown that in many cases
the forces of disease and of decay
are themselves vital, aggressive—
backed by nature as much as our
selves. The same Providence that
watches the fall of a sparrow may
be supposed to watch the insects on
which the sparrow feeds and even
the careers of the microscopic organ
isms that prevent the broken wing
of the sparrow from healing. Neither
is there any reason why such a
Providence should not take a con
tinuous interest in the pathogenic
bacterium that lives in the living
tissue of a man. Pasteur and others
have shown that in the order of na
ture, to rot is as natural as to live.
Disease is not an accident, nor de
cay a blunder. There is simply a
balance of forces, a contention of
organisms, a different phase of the
much talked about struggle for ex
istence.
"We have had of late years much
time spent in the study of social
organisms. History has come to be
largely institutional. Sociology
has been born. The mechanism of
social and industrial life has been
studied as never before, and some
have perhaps come to feel that
social and industrial salvation is a
matter of mechanics, that if we can
only invent the proper anatomy for
the social body it will have unlimit
ed and unending health. Like the
constitution builders of the period
of the French Revolution, many
are inclined to feel that if only the
proper scheme of organization can
be hit upon we shall be saved.
"At present we have a govern
ment that will urobably serve our
purposes admirably so long as we
can contrive to be admirable in
dividuals. It is not so clear that
we have an industrial organization
of which the same can be said. The
cramps we call panics, the inflam
mations we call strikes and lock
outs, the congestions of power we
call trusts, the paralysis we call
non-employment, and the cancer
ous growths we call pauperism and
crime, probably have part of their
origin in systemic causes which no
conceivable degree of righteousness
on the part of individuals could
wholly cure.
"While it may not be right to
say with Karl Marx that men make
political institutions but industrial

institutions make men, yet it must
he admitted that there is force in
j the agitator's claim that the
I promises of democracy may fail of
I fulfilment through industrial
i causes
I"The strong drift of present study
I is liable, however, to cause us to over
I emphasize the mechanical causes of
| the triumph of evil. Such causes
I there are hut they are not the most
! fundamental ones, and -others are
well deserving of serious considera
i lion. Especially is this true in the
I domain of politics or government.
If it be true that the chief present
need in industry is better organiza
tion, it is still more emphatically
true that ihe chief present need on
the political side of our collective
living is better individuals. The
problem on the political side of life
is for the individuals comprising
the people to he brave enough and
intelligent enough and self-sacrific
ing enough so that they can live to
gether under a representative form
of government. If we emphasize
machinery in discussing modern
industry we must emphasize char
acter in discussing modern politics.
"In industry just as in politics it
is true, though we did not dwell
upon it, that there must be healthy
individuals or the best industrial
anatomy will not work. In each
department of our collective living
two things are necessary to health:
lirst, soundjindividuals, and second,
proper organization. If evil triumphs
in either of these departments dis
ease will spread throughout the soc
ial body. A defect in organization
reacts upon and deteriorates the in
dividuals. Any deterioration on
the part of individuals has its
baleful influence upon the social
life. Emphasis has been different
in the two cases because it seems to
be true that while the chief present
need in industry is a different and
better organization, the chief pres
ent need in politics is sounder man
hood and more active loyalty.
'•What I wish especially to bring
out this morning is the duty of
each individual, of you and of me, in
the premises. In the work of or
ganizing or re-organizing indus
trial or social affairs the duties of
different individuals are different.
We act according to our several con
ditions and abilities and prepara
tion. In this work some of us may
have hardly any duties at all, ex
cept not to he obstructionists.
But the surest social service that
any man can render is one that
any man can render: it is to do his
utmost to make himself a healthy
integer for incorporation in the soc-1
ial aggregate. YVe lepeat, social
machinery is important, but sound
individuals are fundamentally im
portant. Would you render a soc
ial service? Be a man. Diseases
are many, but they all work to
gether for the destruction of health. l
Even though there be no social cat
aclysm, even though we he not!
tending toward national or general
triumph of evil, yet evil has its des-;
picable triumphs wherever and :
whenever it is permitted to exist.!
Every day it triumphs somewhat,
lessening each success, and detract
ing from the possible maximum of,
health. There can be nothing in
the individual that is weak or im-1

pure without a corresponding soc
ial reaction. Every yielding to an
unhealthy appetite, every covetous
aid unjust act, every entertain
n ■ nt of a lustful thought, every
I false word or false deed —no mat
ter how well hidden, no matter
bow much covered by other
thoughts and acts of virtue, does
something to limit health and re
enforce the agencies of putrefaction.
'" Why do charitable societies often
I accomplish so little towards the so
i called uplifting of the poor? Often
I and often it is because their man
lagers and supporters and agents
come so far short of the man-and
womanhood that they undertake to
teach to others. What limits the
iniluence of the church ? Often and
often it is the limitations of the
church people. What created a
soul under the ribs of the dead em
pire of Rome? Two things: the
new blood of the north, and the re
vivifying influence of Christianity.
The new forces used the skeleton,
we are using it yet; a knowledge of
its efficient and ingenious articula
tions is and forever will be a help to
the churchman, the statesman, the
jurist, and the plain citizen. But
the new life came from life, and
not from the bones of the dead.
Persons inspired by loyalty to a
great personality gave vigor and
power of growth to the new nations.
"Sound character, if there if
enough of it, will force its way
through great mechanical hin
drances. Fora certain portion of
the character that is to supply the
power of work and growth to the
social organism of the present you
are inevitably and individually re
sponsible. Machinery can not re
lieve you of this responsibility; all
churches and all other institutions
whatsoever can do no more than
help you a little in meeting it. Over
some small fraction of the social
forces your will is law, and if you
do your best to give it right direc
tion you have done something.
" M have a belief of my own and it
comforts me,' says one of George
Eliot's characters, 'that by desir
ing what is perfectly good, even
when we don't quite know what it is
and can not do what we would, we
are part of the divine power against
evil —widening the skirts of I
light and making the struggle with
darkness narrower.' The one so
cial service which you can
surely render is, therefore, to 'keep
thy heart with all diligence, for out
of it are the issues' not only of in
dividual, but of collective life."

" M have a belief of my own and it

Eliot's characters, 'that by desir

when we don't quite know what it is
and can not do what we would, we
are part of the divine power against
evil —widening the skirts of I
light and making the struggle with
darkness narrower.' The one so

surely render is, therefore, to 'keep
thy heart with all diligence, for out
of it are the issues' not only of in
dividual, but of collective life."
The following is an abstract of
Professor Warner's second lecture,
which was delivered yesterday
morning.
"The new pathology of the medi
cal schools has many suggestions
for the student of sociology. There
used to be much talk about the via
medicatrix Aaturuthe healing
power of nature. It was thought
that nature had some special liking
for mail, and would keep him in
health if he would let her. It is
now known that nature is on both
sides of the battle. She gives man
organs and instincts that preserve
him at one time and destroy him at
another. She prods him forward
to a precipice and if he has not
skill enough to get down it safely
she simply drives on more men till
she happens on some who have that
skill More than this, the new path
ology lias shown that in many cases
the forces of disease and of decay
are themselves vital, aggressive—
backed by nature as much as our
selves. The same Providence that
watches the fall of a sparrow may
be supposed to watch the insects on
which the sparrow feeds and even
the careers of the microscopic organ
isms that prevent the broken wing
of the sparrow from healing. Neither
is there any reason why such a
Providence should not take a con
tinuous interest in the pathogenic
bacterium that lives in the living
tissue of a man. Pasteur and others
have shown that in the order of na
ture, to rot is as natural as to live.
Disease is not an accident, nor de
cay a blunder. There is simply a
balance of forces, a contention of
organisms, a different phase of the
much talked about struggle for ex
istence.
"We have had of late years much
time spent in the study of social
organisms. History has come to be
largely institutional. Sociology
has been born. The mechanism of
social and industrial life has been
studied as never before, and some
have perhaps come to feel that
social and industrial salvation is a
matter of mechanics, that if we can
only invent the proper anatomy for
the social body it will have unlimit
ed and unending health. Like the
constitution builders of the period
of the French Revolution, many
are inclined to feel that if only the
proper scheme of organization can
be hit upon we shall be saved.
"At present we have a govern
ment that will urobably serve our
purposes admirably so long as we
can contrive to be admirable in
dividuals. It is not so clear that
we have an industrial organization
of which the same can be said. The
cramps we call panics, the inflam
mations we call strikes and lock
outs, the congestions of power we
call trusts, the paralysis we call
non-employment, and the cancer
ous growths we call pauperism and
crime, probably have part of their
origin in systemic causes which no
conceivable degree of righteousness
on the part of individuals could
wholly cure.
"While it may not be right to
say with Karl Marx that men make
political institutions but industrial

institutions make men, yet it must
he admitted that there is force in
j the agitator's claim that the
I promises of democracy may fail of
I fulfilment through industrial
i causes
I"The strong drift of present study
I is liable, however, to cause us to over
I emphasize the mechanical causes of
| the triumph of evil. Such causes
I there are hut they are not the most
! fundamental ones, and -others are
well deserving of serious considera
i lion. Especially is this true in the
I domain of politics or government.
If it be true that the chief present
need in industry is better organiza
tion, it is still more emphatically
true that ihe chief present need on
the political side of our collective
living is better individuals. The
problem on the political side of life
is for the individuals comprising
the people to he brave enough and
intelligent enough and self-sacrific
ing enough so that they can live to
gether under a representative form
of government. If we emphasize
machinery in discussing modern
industry we must emphasize char
acter in discussing modern politics.
"In industry just as in politics it
is true, though we did not dwell
upon it, that there must be healthy
individuals or the best industrial
anatomy will not work. In each
department of our collective living
two things are necessary to health:
lirst, soundjindividuals, and second,
proper organization. If evil triumphs
in either of these departments dis
ease will spread throughout the soc
ial body. A defect in organization
reacts upon and deteriorates the in
dividuals. Any deterioration on
the part of individuals has its
baleful influence upon the social
life. Emphasis has been different
in the two cases because it seems to
be true that while the chief present
need in industry is a different and
better organization, the chief pres
ent need in politics is sounder man
hood and more active loyalty.
'•What I wish especially to bring
out this morning is the duty of
each individual, of you and of me, in
the premises. In the work of or
ganizing or re-organizing indus
trial or social affairs the duties of
different individuals are different.
We act according to our several con
ditions and abilities and prepara
tion. In this work some of us may
have hardly any duties at all, ex
cept not to he obstructionists.
But the surest social service that
any man can render is one that
any man can render: it is to do his
utmost to make himself a healthy
integer for incorporation in the soc-1
ial aggregate. YVe lepeat, social
machinery is important, but sound
individuals are fundamentally im
portant. Would you render a soc
ial service? Be a man. Diseases
are many, but they all work to
gether for the destruction of health. l
Even though there be no social cat
aclysm, even though we he not!
tending toward national or general
triumph of evil, yet evil has its des-;
picable triumphs wherever and :
whenever it is permitted to exist.!
Every day it triumphs somewhat,
lessening each success, and detract
ing from the possible maximum of,
health. There can be nothing in
the individual that is weak or im-1

pure without a corresponding soc
ial reaction. Every yielding to an
unhealthy appetite, every covetous
aid unjust act, every entertain
n ■ nt of a lustful thought, every
I false word or false deed —no mat
ter how well hidden, no matter
bow much covered by other
thoughts and acts of virtue, does
something to limit health and re
enforce the agencies of putrefaction.
