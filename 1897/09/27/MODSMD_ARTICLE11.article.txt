Stanford is repeatedly and con
tinually misrepresented in many of
the newspapers of California. Ho
long as newspaper men are such as
they are today there is probably no
remedy for this state of affairs. It
does no good to deny reports which
are intentionally made grossly mis
leading. The only way out of the
difficulty seems to be for Stanford
men and women to do what they
can to make the citizens of their
native towns, and their friends
everywhere, understand what the
work of the University and the
character of its students really are.
