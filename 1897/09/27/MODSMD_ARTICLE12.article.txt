We are pleased to note the in
terest shown in the Daily Palo
Alto's proposition to put up sign
boarcls on the paths lending from

Palo Alto to the University. Sev
eral accidents have occurred on the 1
bicycle pa th since last Friday j
which might perhaps have been
avoided if there had been a perfect
understanding of the rules. If all
those interested will lend a hand at
once the sign-boards will soon be
in place. Donations may be
handed to any of the following
members of the staff, all of whom
are intrested in the matter: Miss
Marion Adams, Frank Adams,
0. C. Leiter, Chas. JO. Schwartz.
