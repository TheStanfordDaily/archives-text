# Freshmen Defeat Belmont.
## 
### 
The Freshmen defeated the Bel
mont School team Saturday by a
score of 4 to 0. The grandstand
and side-lines were well filled, hut
little enthusiasm was shown. It
was the Freshmen's first game and
it showed clearly that if Stanford is
to win the line must be strength
ened a great deal before the Inter
collegiate Freshman game.
In the first half there was no
score, although Belmont came
within an ace of scoring. Carson
kicked off to Wilson, who fumbled
and fell on the ball. Mauley and
Wilson carried the ball fifteen yards.
Wilson punted thirty-five yards.
Belmont's return kick was blocked.

After three downs Belmont punted
thirty yards into touch. The Fresh
men soon lost the ball. Belmont
carried it within a foot of the goal,
but then lost it. After several at
tempts to pass the ball Wilson
punted twenty-five yards. Belmont
carried the ball back, but lost it on
downs two yards from the goal line.
Time was called for the iirst half,
the Freshmen having the ball.
In the second half Wadsworth
was substituted for Wardall at
right half, and the play was re
sumed. Wilson kicked for thirt}'-
frve yards to Aberson, who passed
the ball to Cooper, who made ten
yards. The Freshmen got the hall,
and Beckley, Wadsworth, and Wil
son carried it twenty yards. On
a return kick Belmont made a
large gain as the ball rolled past
Wilson, lie punted twenty yards,
and the Freshmen soon gained the
ball again on a fumble by Belmont.
I>y a series of pretty end runs by
Wadsworth and Manley and some
good line bucking by Wilson, the
ball was carried near Belmont's goal
line and Wilson went through the
center fora touch-down. The punt
out was a failure and the score
stood 4-0 in favor of the Freshmen.
Belmont kicked off and the ball
went back and forth, being in Fresh
man territory at the close of the
game. For Belmont, Carson and
Cooper put up the best game, while
for Stanford, Wilson, Wadsworth,
Beckley, and Manley were the stars.
