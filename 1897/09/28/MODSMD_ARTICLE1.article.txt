# EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.
## Plans for the Thanksgiving Game and Evening Entertainment. 
### 
The Executive Committee of the
Associated Students held a meeting
this atternoon. Mr. Shoemaker ap
peared on behalf of the Band to
ask for an appropriation for re
pairs, paraphernalia, and music.
Action on the matter was deferred
until it could be determined with
some degree of accuracy what the
aggregate expense of the Band will
be for the Thanksgiving game.
\V. C. McNeil, for the musical
clubs, asked that the total receipts
of the Thanksgiving show and con
cert be appropriated to cover in
part a possible deficit contracted
by a Southern trip, the clubs being
willing to sign the customary notes
to be paid in case the receipts do
not cover the deficit if there is one.
The committee, after an exhaustive
discussion, found that it would lie
advisable to postpone action on the
matter of the receipts from the
Thanksgiving night entertainment.
The committee has allowed the
clubs the net proceeds of all other
concerts between now and the date
of their trip, it being understood
that the obligation assumed by the
student body last year on account
of the musical clubs, namely, the
Henne note, should be discharged
from the proceeds of the concerts
that are given.
It was decided to pay the ex
penses of the football manager ac
cording to an itemized account to
be presented to the committee.
