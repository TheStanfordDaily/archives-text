The football management de
serves the commendation of all
those who attend the football prac
tices for its efforts to do away with
the nuisance occasioned to specta
tors and players by the motley crew
of urchins which is usually in at
tendance at games. We can ap
preciate the eagerness with which
the younger generation witnesses a
football game, but we do not wish
to intliet upon the players of visit
ing teams a vindictive lot of young
sters whose partisanship to Stan
ford knows no restraint and mani
fests itself in hooting at and heap
ing abuse upon the opposing teams.
It is the intention of the manage
ment to restrict the juvenile ele
ment to the east side of the field,
and in this endeavor every one
should lend his moral and physical
support.
A great many persons appar
ently do not understand the basis
upon which the present Bookstore
is organized. Unlike the old Co-op.,
it is not organized for the purpose
of making a profit for any one.
The articles of incorporation pre
vent any of those who have money
invested in the store from taking
any profit whatsoever from it. The
professors who furnished the money
to start the new store did so at a
distinct financial loss to themselves
of at least the interest on their
money. Students who have any
suspicions that money is being made
on their purchases may therefore
dismiss them at once. Prices at
first must necessarily be experi
mental and in a few cases more
may be charged for books than they
really cost. Hut if such is the case

it will he made up on something
else and as soon as possible the
price will he adjusted to cover the
actual expenses of express, postage,
and clerk hire. We make these ex
planations because we do not be
lieve that the students as a whole
have really appreciated the laud
able motives of those who' have
given their time and money to
bring about the much more satis
factory means of purchasing books
which we now enjoy.
