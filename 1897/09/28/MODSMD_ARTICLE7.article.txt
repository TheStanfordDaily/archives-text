# LAST NIGHT'S PRACTICE.
## Freshman, Varsity, and Second Eleven Teams Line up for Work. 
### 
Yesterday afternoon was cool and
the practice good. Forty-five men
were out in suits for work. There
are still many men having suits
who do not wear them. Suits
should be turned in at once if not
being used. Mr. Brooke first lined
up the Freshmen for signal practice
and spent about-twenty minutes
with them. Their team work is
ragged as yet. The Varsity and
second eleven lined up and spent
some time in the formation for
kick-off. Wilson and Carle did
the kicking. Wilson's kicks were
all short. Carle is already kicking
in good form.
The Varsity spent most of the
time in line bucking, the guards
and tackles being frequently given
the ball. The second eleven is at
present weak, but care will be taken
to build it up from now on.
The new men out were Grey, '01,
O'Hara, '01, both likely looking
candidates for the Freshman team.
The following was the line-up:
