# A 						New Corporation.
## 
### 
The partnership formerly known
as Bell & Dazell has been dissolved
and reorganized as a corporation
with the genial and urbane Mr. Bell
as manager. The growth of this
business has warranted them in
building new stables for their stock
which is composed of some of the
best driving animals in the state.
The old stable is used exclusively
for hacks. The firm will make a
specialty of conducting tourist part
ies over the Stanford grounds,
which they are in a position to do
very satisfactorily, since their driv
ers are all well acquainted with
Stanford University and surround
ings.
