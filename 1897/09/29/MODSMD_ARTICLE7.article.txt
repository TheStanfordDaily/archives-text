# ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD.
## Varsity Interferes Well and Scores One Touch-down on the Second Team. 
### 
'1 lie afternoons are becoming
cooler and more snappy practice I
mav be expected from now on.
There were two practice games
yesterday on tbe ii eld, a mixed
combination of sophomores and i
freshmen lining up first, and then I
the regular Varsity practice.
The interference last night was j
the best this season. There is!
still a noticeable tendency,however, |
on the part of some of the halves
to run into the end in a half
hearted manner, often without
budging him.
Both Smith and Parker at end |
showed up well last night. The
fight between the ends this yearl
will be a very pretty one. All of J
the four men out for the positions I
are playing good ball, and if 110
one receives any serious injury the
competition will be very close.
Fisher did not play his usual game,
but he should soon round into
form. Both Scoville and Wilson
did good work on the second
eleven. Wyckoff also made some
difficult punts. Thomas was run
with the ball several times during
the practice; bis work was good but
will improve when he gingers up.
But one touch-down was made,
Fickert carrying the ball over the
line for the Varsity. The grand
stand was well tilled but there was
a woeful lack of enthusiasm. Or
ganized yelling will probably be
under way the latter part of this
week.
The line-up was as follows:
.Jeffs I end r Parker
Rice 1 tackle r Rusk
Fickert I guard r James
Burnett c Wilson
