# Signs for the Palo Alto Paths.
## 
### 
It is now an assured fact that
signs for the bicycle and foot paths
between I lie University a nd Palo
Alto will be put up soon. Mr, i
Hodges has kindly consented to j
make the sign boards and place
them when painted. This leaves J
the small burden of painting the
signs to be borne by those who de- j
sire to help.
Four signs will be made, one for'
each end of each path. They will
he solidly made and durably
painted. The cost will be about
five dollarsâ€”no exact figures have
yet been obtained. Of this amount, i

about one dollar and a half has
been subscribed; the balance is
solicited from any who feel that
11 ley will be benefited by the im
provement. Subscriptions may be
handed to any member of the Daily
Palo Alto staff. Donations of
even five cents will be welcomed.
