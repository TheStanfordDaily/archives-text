# BRANDING THE SEALS
## Dr. Jordan Denies That the Marks Will Not be Permanent. 
### 
In reply to the statement that
the brands placed on the seals by
electricity is not permanent, Dr.
Jordan is quoted as follows in this
morning's Call:
"The electrical branding appara
tus invented by Mr. Farmer ar
rived the day we left. We were
afraid at that time that the dyn
amo was not large enough for the
work we intended it to do.
"However, we had along a
thorough equipment of the very lat
est and most approved branding
irons. They had been thoroughly
tested, and there was no doubt of
their efficiency. The statement
that the seals have been driven to
Japan or anywhere else is a delib
erate lie and imaginary fabrication.
"They do not go a rod away on
account of any operation of that
kind. They pay a great deal less
attention to disturbances than do
sheep when being sheared.
"It is a fact that ever since 1709
all the males under 6 years old
have been driven to the killing
grounds every week and sorted
over, and the old and young re
leased to come back a week later,
"They return without the slight
est remembrances that anything
had happened. This shows how
little they are influenced by any
thing that would ordinarily cause
fear to other animals.
"It was not our intention to
brand any large per cent this year,
but rather to And the means neces
sary to do it on the largest scale if
it should be found necessary,
"The whole matter is left to the
discretion of the chief agent, Joseph
Murray, who lias had charge of the
details from the lirst. Last year
he was appointed assistant to the
commission by ex-President Cleve
land, and this year President Mc-
Kinley appointed him agent on the
island.
"As far as known, there has never
been a case of a seal crossing from
the American to the Russian islands.
The seals on the Russian islands
are a different species from those
found on Pribylof. There are only
a few dozen individuals left of the
Japanese herd, and they differ from
both the Pribylof and Russian
forms."
