The early work which the track
men and some of the baseball men
are doing encourages us to hope for
pleasant results next semester.
U. C. has practically still intact,
and with additions from the fresh
man class, the track team which
overcame us last year. We received
our first defeat in baseball then.
Early and constant practice and
training seem to be our only hope
this year.
