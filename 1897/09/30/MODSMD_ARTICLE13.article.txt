Professou Sanford will deliver
a lecture in Nortree Hall, Palo
Alto, tomorrow evening on the
latest discoveries in electricity, for
the benefit of the Ladies' Improve
ment Fund of Palo Alto. This fund
is devoted to beautifying Palo Alto
Considerable money has been ex
pended during the last few years
on the circle near the depot. The
fund is now in arrears for recent
improvements, and the ladies have
taken this means to build it up.
The lecture will be interesting and
instructive. The object is a worthy
one arid every one who can do so
should attend.
