Their successful fulfillment will re
sult in the demolition of the pres
ent buildings and the erection of
new ones on a more elaborate scale.
Jt is understood that Mrs. Hearst
will contribute the money for the
principal buildings. A fund of
about $4,000,000 has already been
pledged by the citizens of Califor

give a large sum to be added to by
annual appropriations.
After all arrangements have been
completed for securing plans from
the most famous architects of this
country and of Europe, a jury will
pass upon them, awarding prizes to
the best ten. The jury is to be
made up of Pascal, of France; Paul
Wallot, of Germany; Thierach, of
Austria; Ziegler, of Hungary; Zac
coni, of Italy; Norman Shaw, of
England; and one from this country
who is yet to be chosen.
In addition to this jury an advis
ory board hits been chosen includ
ing Alma Tadema, Puvis de
Chayannes, and Lancini, landscape
architectsof France. Tothis board
is to be added an American mem
ber, who is likely to be August St.
Gaudens. The duties of the advis
ory board will he to see that the I
buildings are erected in such places
as will best conserve and enhance
the beauty of the landscape and
that the interior decorations har
monize.
