# Who Has That Letter?
## 
### 
In reporting a meeting of the U.C
athletic committee a recent issue
of the Californian has the follow
ing:
"A letter was addressed to Le
land Stanford Jr. University to
the effect that if it had any definite
charges against Coleman R.
Broughton, to make them to the
suitable body and cease getting
into the r.ewspapers."
[Since then we have been trying
in vain to find the letter, but those
in authority here deny having re
ceived any such communication
from Berkeley.]
