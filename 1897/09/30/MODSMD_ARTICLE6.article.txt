# TRACK ATHLETICS.
## Early Training- Will be Begun by Captain Brunton. 
### 
The Freshman and Sophomore
teams were both out for signal
practice yesterday afternoon. The
Sophomore team lined up for sig
nals while the Freshmen were sent
against a team picked from Var
sity, second eleven, and Freshmen.
Carle at guard and Fickert and
Thomas behind the line starred for
the picked team. The Freshman
work is not at all satisfactory.
Many men come out for one or two
nights and then fora week stay
away. Unless greater interest is
manifested our Freshmen will be
a disappointment in the intercol
legiate game, Mr. Brooke spends
much time with the Freshman
team —more than any coach before
has ever done —yet the men as a
whole take less advantage of it.
The Varsity interference is im
proving. Last night good runs
were made by Thomas, Rice, Carle,
and Fickert, with everybody in the
play.
The best work yesterday was done
by Jeffs, whose running and tack
ling were excellent. Cotton made a
pretty run from Wilson's punt and
bucked and interfered in old-time
form. Daley is improving and now
runs well with the ball, showing
good judgment in picking his holes.
Several men were hurt last night.
McFadden, whose playing of late
has occasioned much interest, in
jured his knee and ankle. Murphy
had his ribs hurt and had to lay off,
but the injury will not keep him in.
The men are too slow in getting
out and as the days are becoming
shorter, practice must start earlier.
The line-up was as follows:
Jeffs 1 end r Parker
Rice 1 tackle r Rusk
Fickert 1 guard r James
Burnett center Wilson
