# Men on the Track.
## 
### 
Captain Brunton has this year
made an innovation in track ath
letics at Stanford by getting his
men out early in the .year. Last
year the trainer found that when
he had got the men up to a certain
point he could go no further with
them because they had not devel
oped enough muscle and endurance
before they came under his care for
him to build upon. This was es
pecially true of distance men. It
is to obviate this difficulty that
Captain Brunton has had the team
go into fall training.
Captain Brunton will have the
men do only light work for the
first semester. He hopes thus to
develop material suitable to put
into the trainer's hands when he
arrives next spring. When seen
this afternoon, Brunton smid lie was
very well satisfied with the men
who have turned out so far and
with the way they work. He is j
confident that if more of the new J

men will come out for this prelim
inary work and if tliey ;ill keep at
work as they have, we shall have a
strong team. He would like to see
a large squad out every afternoon,
especially candidates for the dis
tances. Inexperienced men with
this training may stand a better
chance under a trainer than vet
erans who rely on their past
achievements. Me is on the track
every Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday afternoon.
