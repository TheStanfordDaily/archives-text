# OUR COACH ON FOOTBALL
## More Men are Needed for the Second Eleven and the Freshman Team. 
### 
The football season at Stanford
has now begun in earnest and all
Stanford men who huve the success
of their University elevens at heart
and who are physically qualified to
play football should now turn out
for the daily practice.
The second team so far this sea
son has been unable except in a
few instances to put up a game that
gave the Varsity side adequate
practice for the purpose of a devel
opment of good team play. At
Stanford this fall we have, I think,
the men with which to build up a
winning team; but they will never
learn to play the game which they
are capable of playing until there
has been developed a strong side to
oppose them in daily practice. At
present we often have trouble in
getting enough men for the second
eleven; and when one of them re
ceives an injury that lays him off;
or if the same casualty happens to
the Varsity side, then the lack of
men puts a quietus on all good
practice for the rest of the after
noon.
These are plain facts, and Stan
ford can never hope to attain the
rank of a first-class football college
until there are candidates for the
second eleven just as eager to play
as the candidates for the first
eleven. How are future Stanford
teams to be built up except from
players with scrub experience?
Most of the eleven of this fall leave
in the spring and the scrub men
will be the Varsity players of next
year. The second eleven is a hard
school in which to learn to play
football, hut it is the most thorough,
and the school that has turned out
every player of any note in the
East. Berkeley seems to have a
superabundance of candidates, and
on this fact they can base whatever
success they attain.
I would like to have enough
freshmen come out to compose two
teams that shall play against each
other every afternoon.
I expect to pay especial attention
to the scrub eleven fora week or
more and would like to have all
candidates who have not been play
ing on the Varsity side meet me in
room 11 quad Monday evening at
7:15 for the purpose of effecting a
better organization. Games and a
good trip will be arranged for the
second team. Geo. H. Brooke.
