The "broken bones" article in
this morning's Exnminer, pretend
ing to be an account of the game
yesterday, is highly characteristic
of that journal. It is un
doubtedly a mixture of some "un
derground" report and the Stan
ford correspondence, combined with
some of the brilliant "yellow" of a
writer in the Examiner office. There
were no bones broken at Stanford.
The injuries received by Wadsworth
were not as serious as at first an
ticipated, and the sport was not
"the most furious ever seen on the
Stanford field." It was in reality
a comparatively slow game. It in
nowwarj r resembled a rush. Such
reports tend to cast the game of
football into disrepute, as well as
the University. Such journalism
is deserving of the severest reproach.
It is unfortunate that the responsi
bility for the article can not be def
initely fixed.
