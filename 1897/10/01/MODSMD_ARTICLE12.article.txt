Coach Buooke's communication
in today's paper is deserving of the
most careful consideration from
every one interested in maintaining
Stanford's supremacy on ilie foot
ball field. He points out that Stan
ford this year lacks a strong second
eleven. In years past the strength
of our second eleven has been the
source of the strength of our Var
sity. This year many of our sec
ond eleven men did not return,
others have been placed on the Var
sity, and the result has been the
weakening of the forces upon which
we depend for most of the Varsity's
training. The team is not so weak
in individual players as it is in
numbers. In a university of the

size of Stanford there are plenty of
men with thephysiqueand stamina
necessary for football players.
These men should respond to Mr.
Brooke's call with alacrity. A crisis
exists at present which the men of
Stanford must meet.
