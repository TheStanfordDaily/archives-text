the faculty committee on the Car

given by Oskison, '98, who outlined
the plan that was adopted. The

compete in the preliminaries. Mem

can compete individually. The
meetings will be in the nature of
inter-society meetings and the rolls
of each society will be called.

their society may compete from
the student body. Three judges
will beselected by the faculty com
mittee and the committee of the
league, who will choose the three
best speakers to represent Stanford
on the Carnot debate in 1898.

sub-committee of the executive com
