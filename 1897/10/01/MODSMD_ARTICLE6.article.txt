# PRIBYLOF PARTY RETURNS.
## Stanford Men Bring- Many Rare Specimens Buck From the Far North 
### 
The U. S. revenue cutter "Ilush" i
arrived yesterday noon in San
Francisco with the Stanford party!
from the Pribylof Islands. Of the
members of the party Greeley, ? 08, i
Snodgross, '99, Edwards, '00, and!
liristow Adams, '00, were on the
campus today. Instructor Farmer
stopped at Alameda fora short
visit with his relatives but is ex
pected at the University tonight or
tomorrow.
With the exception of Adams,
who left for the Pribylofs with Mr.
Clark on May 21, the party has
been at work among the seals since
July 27. Instructor Farmer and
Warren, '98, were engaged in the
work of conducting the experiment
of branding the seals by electricity,
and in spite of the reports of the
daily press, the branding was a
perfect success in every respect.
liesides the work in taking the
seal census, building the fence en
closing the Salt Lagoon to prevent
the re-driving of the Tmchelor'
seals, and the branding, the mem
bers of the Zoology department,
Snodgrass and Greeley with Trevor
Kincaid, instructor of the Univer
sity of Washington, did a great
deal of valuable collecting, mostly
of bird skins and skeletons and
marine invertebrates. Mr. Kincaid
made a comprehensive collection of
the insects of the islands, ami
altogether the trip was most success
ful as regards collecting scientific
specimens and data. Adams' main
work was in making sketches of the
seals, and as Dr. Jordan expressed
himself on his arrival at the islands
lie was ''pleased with the quality of
the work but most disappointed as
to quantity." However, Adams
had a month on the Islands after
Dr. Jordan left and the deficiency
in quantity may have been made
up.
Mr. Clark's contingent went to
the islands on the North American
Commercial Company's steamer
"Del Norte," stopping only at
Kadiak Island and Uualaska on
the way up; but the other party
went up via Seattle and Sitka,
seeing more of the country and
doing some collecting on the way.
The trip down was made on the
cutter "Perry'' to Unalaska, after a
cruise of four days in heavy
weather. The trip from Unalaska
was made in the record time of nine
days.
On the islands the boys found
things much more civil'zed than
they had expected; indeed they
were treated in princely style, every
tiling being of the best. I he bil
liard hall was given up to their use,
and Stanford Hall, as it came to be
known, with its six cardinal
blanketed beds, was the scene of
many memorable gatherings and
episodes, the surveying party with
assistants from the University of
Chicago adding its share and in
t urn entertaining the Stanford con
tingent.
The social life was rather devoid
of the influence of the fair sex, with
the notable exceptions of two
visits bv daughters of the revenue
cutter commanders. Two dances

were given on the islands, one on
.July 11 and another on September
10, the night before the departure
from the islands.
The summer work was ended by
an extended tour of St. Paul Island
and the exploration of two caves
discovered on Boga Slov mountain —
an extinct volcano—in one of which
were found the bones of several
animals now unknown to the
islands, including some mastodon
teeth, the latter an important dis
covery.
