# "WHEN CHANGES COME"
## Third Sermon by Dr. Amos G. Warner Delivered Yesterday Morning. 
### 
The third in Dr. Warner's series
of four sermons to students was de
livered in the chapel yesterday
morning. He spoke in part as fol
lows:
"At the close of his speech on
'Conciliation with America' Ed
mund Burke addressed the British
House of Commons as follows:
" 'Magnanimity in politics is not
seldom the truest wisdom; and
great empire and little minds go ill
together. If we are conscious of
our situation, and glow with zeal to
liil our place as becomes our station
and ourselves, weought to auspicate
all our public proceedings on
America with the old warning of
the church, 'Sursum Corda,' Lift
your hearts!' We ought to
elevate our minds to the greatness
of that trust to which the order of
Providence has called us.'
"The people to whom comes the
gift of growth, of expansion, of
change, must, if they would avoid
disaster, 'elevate their minds to the
greatness of that trust to which the
order of Providence has called
them,' must rise above petty selfish
ness and party blindness, must plan
for the future guided by the past,
must be broadly wise, must 'lift up
their hearts.'
"Change, we are happy to think,
is t le order of our own time, and it
is. The hurrying presses can
hardly bring us news of changes as
fast as they occur. On tho material
side the diverse movements are
pretty well recorded, but in institu
tional matters the changes are often
not manifest until they are com
plete. Yet growth is frequently a
dangerous process, and changes
whether of birth or death or de
velopment are seldom painless. As
England met the inevitable change
of relations with her growing
colonies in the wrong way and
suffered therefrom, so the very
changes on which we pride our
selves give us ever present oppor
tunities for blundering and suffer
ing. We live in a time of chronic
crisis, of unintermittent responsi
bility for right development. The
changes that we see, and more
especially those that occur un
heralded, bring severally and
collectively imperative demands for
constructive leadership, for intelli
gent radicalism. As we turned
our attention one week ago chiefly
to the social importance of having
healthy individuals as a pre
requisite of good organization, let
us today examine a little more
closely the duties of the individual
towards the machinery of which he
forms a part. Private virtue is
fundamentally important, but the
art of living together will not be
fully mastered until many public
virtues have been added to the in
dividual's equipment for collective
living. Loyalty, civic courage, the
lifted heart for which Burke
pleaded, are also essential in times
like ours.
" 'New occasions teach new duties;
time makes ancient good j
uncouth,
They must upward, still, and
onward who would keep abreast;
of truth.'

"As we turn to examine some of
these new duties let us look lirst at
the senii-nieehanical side of life and
the great changes in national and
social organization that have come
from the existence and dominance
of the railroads. It is an undis
puted and general fact that our
whole national life is organized
differently than it would have been
except for the existence of railroads.
"The second change at the
dangers and requirements of which
we would glance is that which
is bringing about the omnipresence
of associated effort, to the exclusion
of isolated individual action in
either politics, education, or busi
ness. The artificial person, the
corporation, in some of its many
forms is triumphant everywhere,
and the great realm of business life
lias been subdued very recently but
very completely.
"The last great change to which
we will briefly refer is a change in
social philosophy. Reformers of a
hundred years ago strove to reach
the millenium. We have given that
up. They strove each time for some
definite and final goal impelled by
faith in religious or political dog
mas. We are face to face with what
Professor Small calls the epoch
making fact 'that today's men
have gradual I}' cut the moorings of
ethical and social tradition after
tradition, and that society is today
adrift, without definite purpose to
shape its course, and without a
supreme conviction to give it mo
tion.'
"Here we have a personal respon
sibility for social welfare that has no
known limit in time or in degree. The
tardily unsealed order of nature, to
quote again from Professor Small,
is this: 'Be thou a forceful part of
that continuous cosmic enterprise
which forever unmakes the things
of today, to re-create them in the
things of tomorrow.'
"We are evolving, but to what
end we can not see. We are partly
responsible for this evolution, and
have lately become conscious of our
directive influence in shaping its
course. Tne forces of nature that
have thus far fashioned us are
ready to become our slaves instead
of our drivers, to take orders from
us instead of giving them to us.
"Here we see a change the most
fundamental of any, and the most
disheartening or the most inspiring
of any according as we have or have
not faith in man or in the powers
that guide him; according as we do
or do not rise to the requirements
of the high calling wherewith
we are now called. It seems as
though we were expected to go for
ward into the dark; but as was said
in the first sermon of this series, it
is onl}- children who have a right
to be afraid of the dark, it is fre
quently the business of men to go
forward into it. Standing on the
threshold of a future that is to be
much better or much worse than
the past, we must not only use our
reason but we must rely upon our
better instincts, summon our conr-;
age, must 'lift, our hearts' to the
new responsibilities of the time.
"Thus if we will but listen, from
all departments of modern life
comes up the burr and bum of
change, and with the sound ofi

change is always blended the call
to higher duties and to better ser
vice. As was said one week ago,
we stand today industrially and
j socially very much where our
fathers stood politically when inde
pendence of England had been won,
but the more 'perfect union' of the
States had not yet been reached.
At that time of critical change
when it seemed as though the con
stitutional convention might break
up without accomplishing its diff
icult hut all-important task, even
Benjamin Franklin saw that it was
good politics to unite in prayer,
lie appreciated as Burke had done
before, and as liudyard Kipling
has done in this jubilee year of
Queen Victoria, that the spirit of
devotion is the only one in which
can he reared the superstructure of
a lasting state. When Burke, fac
ing that change and crisis in im
perial administration, urged mag
nanimous action upon the Houseof
Commons, he did so in words which
the church had used for centuries
to call its devotees to prayer. 'Lift
your hearts' for 'great empire and
little minds go ill together.' Since
these words were spoken the civil
ized peoples of the world have con
quered yet vaster empires of mater
ial force and moral responsibility,
which now they must administer
for the common good or the com
mon harm. It will depend much
upon the spirit in which we act
whether we go forward to the blun
ders and disasters of George 111, or
to the successes of the men who es
tablished, as on a rock, the govern
ment of- the United States. 'If we
are conscious of our situation, and
glow with zeal to fill our place as
becomes our station and ourselves,'
we must believe with Franklin and
Burke that in times of change and
crisis and danger the call to politi
cal action should be the same as
the call to prayer. So believing
and remembering we may even
hope to meet worthily our present
responsibilities, 'to elevate our
minds to the greatness of that trust
to which the order of Providence
has called us.' "
