# Y.M.C.A. Defeats Freshman.
## 
### 
The light, Y. M.C. \. team of Sun
Francisco upheld its brilliant rec
ord of victories on Saturday by de
feating the Freshmen by a very
narrow margin, the kicking of a
goal. The score was 6 to 4.
The game was hotly contested
from start to finish, and though the
halves were short, the game was
fast. The most noticeable differ
ence in the playing of the two
I teams was in the dash and spirit
of the play. Our men were too
slow, the line men in particular.
Often the Freshman guards would
watch their opponents' play start
and gain headway before moving,
when by breaking through the
line, or by blocking the opposing
guard, the whole play could have
been stopped. The Y. M. C. A.
lads played together with a dash
which was pleasing to see.
Stanford kicked off and Y. M.C. A.
forced the luill back to the center of
the field where it was lost.on a
fumble. The Freshmen then fum
bled and were finally forced to
kick, being fortunate in recovering

the ball on Y. M. C. A.'s fumble.
Manley now made some runs
around the right end, and after go
ing straight through the line for
thirty-five yards on a fake kick, he
carried the ball over fora touch
down.
In the second half Y. M. C. A.
kicked off, the ball going over the
line where it was kicked by Dole to
the twenty-yard line. Y. M. C. A.
then bucked it over fora touch
down and kicked a goal.
The Freshmen kicked off and the
ball was bucked by quick dives
against tackle and guard to their
fifteen-yard line, where Y. M. C. A.'s
attempt to kick was blocked with a
loss of twenty yards. After two
downs time was called with the
ball on the Freshmen's twenty-five
yard line. The star work of the
day was done by Ma 11 ley for the
Freshmen and Iladdigan for the
Y. M. C. A. eleven.
