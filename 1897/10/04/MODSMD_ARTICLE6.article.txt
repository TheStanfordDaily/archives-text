Whatevek may be said about
the excellence or shortcomings of
the Daily Palo Alto, we feel justi
fied in milking the statement that
it lias been from its beginning a far
better paper than Stanford has de
served. A most lamentable state
of affairs exists at Stanford from it
journalistic point of view. There
is scarcely another school in the en
tire country where there is so I : ttle
rivalry for positions on the staffs ot
the student papers. There is but
one other college daily out of the
ten now published in the United
States which is gotten out by s<
small a staff as that of the Daily
Palo Alto. On most of these
papers'a sharp competition is car
ried on throughout the year, and
to be on the staff of the college
daily is considered one of the high
est honors within the reach of the
student. This, we believe, is as it
should be, but it is in striking con
trast with the situation here.
There are few applications for
places on the Daily Palo Alto
and the editor-in-chief is usually
compelled to make up his stall
largely bv personal solicitation.
What his staff lacks in numbers lie
often has to make un by imposing
an extra burden on its most willing
and faithful members. This is an
injustice, but it is the way the
paper has been run in previous
years and the only way in which
it can be kept up in the future un
less some change is made in student
sentiment.
For we can not but believe that
the students as a whole are respon
sible for this indifference. The
cacoethes Hcribendi his its victims
everywhere, and there will always
be some who will write for our
student papers simply because the
work is fascinating. But the aver
age individual can not be induced to
go through all the drudgery unless
there is "honor in it." And when
the average assistant finds how few
people know or really care whether
he is connected with the student
daily or not, his zest for work is
very, very apt, to fhig. How many

of the readers of this paper ever
look at the head of this column to!
read the names of those who are
striving daily to make the Daily
Palo Alto a convenience to the
student body and a credit to the
University? How many students
have close friends of whose work on
the paper they are entirely igno
rant? All this is discouraging to
those who realize that with much
less work expended in other lines
they could win glory in athletics or
a much better record in the class
room.
We need more help in getting
out this paper. We must have it.
The work is falling too heavily on
our present staff. In the future
better recognition must be given to
those who toil to keep up the stand
ard of our student publications or
those who refuse to give it will
have their attention called to the
matter somewhat more forcibly
than they may enjoy.
