It is interesting to remark the
number of Stanford people already
identified with the San Francisco
Call.
For about two years past there
have been three Stanford men on
the staff. Benson, ex-'95, formerly
of San Jose, who does Saturday and
Sunday work in the local depart
ment;'like, '95, a regular of the
local department; and Culver,
ex-'97, of the art department.
Last Friday Merle Johnson, '97,
who did illustrating for the '9fi,
the '97, and the '98 \nnual, for the
Sequoia, and for defunct Josh, began
work on the art staff. His (irst
illustration appeared in Sunday's
issue. In the same number was
published a half-page signed arti
cle on college girl actors, written by
Miss Eugenia B. Maburv, 94, of
San Jose, who wrote '9-I's senior
farce and later attended a woman's
college in the East. She had
another signed article in the pre
ceding Sunday Call.
It is possible that Mr. Samuel
Jacques Brun, late assistant pro
fessor of French, author of Tales of
Languedoc, and at present a San
Francisco lawyer, may soon begin
a series of articles in the Call.
