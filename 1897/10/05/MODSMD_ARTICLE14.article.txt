Stanford students seem to hav<
fallen into a frame of mind whereii
they approve of the deeds of activ<
men and women, and yet are loatl
to take any decisive steps towards
helping along a good cause. Thi>
was exemplified last evening whei
only a few men responded to Coacl
Brooke's call for men for the secon<
eleven and the Freshman team
On every side was manifested agree
ment with Mr. Urooke's clear state
ment that we can not build up ;i
strong Varsity if we have a weak
second team. The football crank
said: "That'sdead right." Others
used more elegant expressions, bui
all agreed. Now, if some of thost
big, strapping fellows who are al
ways telling how eager they are
that Stanford should defeat Berke
ley would only turn out for prac
tice, they would be doing some
thing towards that end. Mr.
Brooke has called another meeting
for Wednesday evenine. Let us
have less verbal support of Mr.
Brooke's proposal and more active,
physical assistance.
