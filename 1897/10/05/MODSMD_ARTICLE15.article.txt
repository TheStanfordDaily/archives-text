Among the interesting organiza
tions of the University is the
Women's Athletic Association, the
object of which is to promote ath
letics and physical well-being
among the women. The benefits of
the association are open to all
women pursuing any line of study
in the University, to the ladies of
the faculty, and to the families of
the professors. The fee is only
twenty-five cents a semester, which

is used to help pay for tennis balls
and other apparatus, and to keep the
basket-ball field in order. The as
sociation has also received from
time to time appropriations from
the student body treasury. The
association has heretofore organized
bicycle, tennis, basket-ball, and
archery clubs.
On tomorrow afternoon there
will be a meeting of the asso
ciation for the purpose of electing
officers and making plans for the
year, and this will be an excellent
opportunity for all women inter
ested in the success of athletics to
â– diow their interest. It is especially
desirable that all new students at
tend, and see for themselves what
the Stanford Women's Athletic As
.
sociation is doing.
