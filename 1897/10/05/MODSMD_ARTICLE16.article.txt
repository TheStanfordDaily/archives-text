[CONTUIBUTHD].
At the Christian Association
meeting Sunday evening Mr. R. R
Gailev of Princeton University pre
sented the enterprise in which Stan
ford became so much interested last
year. It will he remembered that
after some consideration by a num
ber of the students and professors
it was decided to support to the ex
tent of at least live hundred dol
lars the work among the students
of India conducted by Mr. Eddy.
This work has been entirely suc
cessful and Eddy's strong personal
ity is having a marked effect upon
the student life of India.
But the world is the field and
this year our attention and our ef
forts are to be directed to the stu
dents of China. Every year there
conies up to the capital cities of
China thousand of students to take
the examinations for what corres
ponds to our bachelor's, master's,
and doctor's degrees. It is among
this class that we are going to help
support Mr. Robt. E. Lewis. Mr.
Lewis is a University of Vermont
man and is at present doing a
grand work among the Eastern col
leges in the interest of the Student
Volunteer Movement, lie was on
the Coast last spring and a number
of our students became acquainted
with him and recognized in him a
man of great earnestness and abil
ity. We all feel sure that we could
have no better man to represent
Stanford among the students of
China, unless it were one of our
own alumni. Before Mr. Lewis'de
parture this winter he will spend a
day with us and we can all come in
touch with him personally.
In this work Stanford is getting
in line with the large colleges and
universities of the East, many of
which entirely support one or more
men in the foreign field. The plan
which was followed so successfully
last year will be again employed,
which is to raise the money re
quired by weekly gifts. Every one
interested in this work, whether
student, member of the faculty, or
friend, is asked to help it. An ef
fort will be made to reach all per
sonally, but of course some may he
missed, and any such may send
their names and the amounts the)*
wish to contribute weekly to Miss
S. M. Dickson, or Paul A. Adams.
Some little canvassing has al
ready been done with very encour
aging results. The work here will
be under the direction of a commit
tee of nine, three from each of the
Christian Associations.
