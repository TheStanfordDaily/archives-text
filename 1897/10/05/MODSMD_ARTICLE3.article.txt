# Trips for the Freshmen.
## 
### 
The Freshman team will go to
San Mateo next Friday to play the
St. Matthew's School eleven. They
will go to San Francisco Saturday
morning to meet the Lowell High
School on the Eighth and Harri
son street grounds. This game will
be called at 10:30 so that it may
be concluded early enough for the
grounds to be putin order for the
Varsity-Reliance game in the after
noon.
