# Reliance Defeats U.C.
## 
### 
The tirst league game of the sea
son was played on the new grounds
in San Francisco Saturday between
the Reliance and University of
California teams. Reliance won
by a score of 10 to 0.
In the first half Berkeley's varsity
team played and in the second a
team consisting of new men came on
the field. There was no score in
the first half. The game was on
the whole lacking in interest,
Berkeley making no real attempt
to win, hut endeavoring to secure
practice for both the varsity and
second teams.
Both teams fumbled frequently.
Hall and Hopper put up the best
game for Berkeley, and Morse and
Carter for Reliance. In the first
half Reliance had the hall on
Berkeley's two-yard line and then
fumbled. Carter made a sensa
tional run of forty yards, almost
scoring a touch-down. The U. C.
line showed weakness in defensive
play.
In the second half Reliance
scored after ten minutes of play,
Flick having the ball. Soon after
Morse went through the left, tackle
for the second. Cnly one goal was
kicked.
The line-up was as follows:
