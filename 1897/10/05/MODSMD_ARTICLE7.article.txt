# LAST NIGHT'S PRACTICE.
## Men Slow in Beginning But Play Fast When Once on the Field. 
### 
The men were slow in corning
out yesterday afternoon and prac
tice did not begin until nearly tive
o'clock. The play was hard and
frequent stops were made for slight
in juries and for wind. The second
eleven out at present is not the
strongest that can be formed and
additional men were put on to make
the play more even,
Capt. Cotton did not come out in
uniform on account of a sore ankle,
and Jeffs was played at fullback
where he made some pretty bucks.
It would be well if some of the men
would copy that dash and vigor
which is characteristic of his play.
The Varsity line held well and the
second eleven could not make
ground through it. The second
team as yet does not play together,
but that may be excused to a con
siderable degree on account of the
number of changes which have to
he made in it. Fisher is not yet
up to Varsity form in offensive
play, but is improving. Smith
played a star game at end, doing
good defensive work and making
two pretty runs, one of which netted
the only touch-down of the after
noon. Rusk and Daly also made
good runs.
The grandstand is still silent and
something should lie done immedi
ately to organize the yelling.
The men lined up as follows:
VAHSITY SECOND ELEVEN.
