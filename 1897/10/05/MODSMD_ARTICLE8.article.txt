### 
Percy Hall is now captain of the
football eleven of the University
of California. This is only one re
sult of the shake-up which has
been taking place in U. C. football
circles.
Sheehy started the revolt against
Haskell and Nott last week when
be manifested decided sign* of in
subordination. Sheehy supposed,
according to reports, that he had a
''cinch" on his place and was de
cidedly averse to receiving coach
ing from Mr. Nott or Archie Pierce,
assistant coach. Sentiment among
the students and football men was
aroused also against Haskell and
Nott for endeavoring to enforce
their coaching system, which w r as
very unpopular. This culminated
yesterday morning when Haskell
tendered his resignation to the ath
letic committee. This was accepted,
and Hall was elected captain.
Sheehy, however, is not yet recon
ciled. On last Friday he insulted
Mr. Pierce and was given the al
ternative of apologizing or sever
ing his connection with the team.
Unless an apology is forthcoming
from Sheehy things will doubtless
remain in the same state, as the
U. C. authorities feel that Sheehy
must be made to realize that insub
ordination is a serious offence for a

football player. Haskell shows a
commendable spirit in continuing
to try for the team.
