# ARMY TEAM DEFEATED.
## Varsity Easily Wins the First Game on the Campus by a Score of 12 to 0. 
### 
The Varsity played its first out
side game with the Army team
from the Presidio and won in a
walk.
The result was never in doubt for
a moment after live minutes of
play, and had the halves each been
a tritie longer it is probable that
the score would have been doubled.
Time was called for each half with
the ball within the Army's five
yard line. The visiting team
won the toss and chose the north
goal, the wind blowing directly
down the field from the south.
Carle kicked off and Seawright
caught the ball and ran it in.
Army tried to run the ends but
made no gain, Carle breaking
through and blocking the play.
Army kicked and Murphy made a
fair catch from which he kicked
in touch. Varsity got the ball and
ran it to the ten-yard line where
Fisher, under Carle's interference,
went around the left end fora
touch-down. Murphy kicked the
goal. Stanford 6, Army 0.
Army kicked off and Murphy re
turned it fifty-five yards. Stan
ford got the ball, and Daly went
around the right end for twenty
live yards and Fisher around the
left for five. Time for first halt
was called with the ball inside the
Army's five-yard line.
In the second half Perry's kick
off went over the line and the ball
was brought back to the center ol
the lield. On the second kick the
ball went to Carle who ran it in
twelve yards. Smith went around
the right end and Fisher with Mur
phy's interfering around the left
for good gains. With the ball on
Army's five-yard line, Carle was
sent between tackle and guard for
a touch-down. Murphy kicked tin
goal, making the score 12-0.
Army kicked off to Rice who
made a good run of twenty-five
yards. Smith worked the right
end for ten more but lost the ball
after a good run. Murphy made n
fine run of thirty yards from a free
kick. Stanford worked the ball to
Army's five-yard line through good
bucks by Fisher and Daly when
the whistle blew for the second
half.
There was quite a large crowd
present but as usual there was a
lack of enthusiasm. The men lined
up as follows:
VARSITY. ARMY.
Smith 1 end r. . . . Engstrom
Rice 1 tackle r. . .. Ilensley
Fickert 1 guard r Shipes
Burnett center Young
Carle r guard 1 Hopper

Daly 1 half r. . Williamson
Fisher r half 1. . . .Seawright

Umpire, Coach Brooke; referee,
Harrelson, '95; linesman, Lieuten
ant Roudiez.
On the whole the Varsity played
a good game, especially good for this
time of year. Carle and Smith put
up the best game for Stanford, ex
celling in both offensive and defen
sive play. Murphy made some

clever runs and played a quick
game at quarter. Fisher and Daly
made good gains.
For the Army some of the play
ers were noticeable for their rowdy
ism, but the rest of the Army team
played hard, square ball and de
serve great credit for holding the
Varsity down as they did. The
punting of Perry and the quarter
back play of Kinzie were the fea
tures of the Army boys' play.
