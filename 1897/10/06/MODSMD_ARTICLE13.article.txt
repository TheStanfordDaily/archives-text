Something must be done at once
in regard to the Freshman team. It
is apparent that the eleven is not
strong enough and at the present
rate of work will not be strong
enough on October the 30th to
make any kind of a showing against
Berkeley. The freshmen have
drawn almost enough suits for
three teams and yet there is little
more than one team on the field
each night. Freshmen, you ought
to have the welfare of your Uni
versity and class enough at heart
to help strengthen your team or at
least give your clothes to somebody
that will. There must be enough
men out for two freshman teams
from now until the Freshman game.

Mr. Brooke has asked that your
attention be forcibly called to this
matter. It is lamentable that such
an appeal is necessary, but now
that it has been made you ought to
heed and obey it.
