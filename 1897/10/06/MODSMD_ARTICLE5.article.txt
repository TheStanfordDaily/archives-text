The executive committee of the
I liter-Society Debating League met
yesterday afternoon and completed
arrangements for the Carnot prelim
inareis.
The preliminaries will beheld on
November 1(5 and 20. The meet
ings will be in the nature of inter
society contests and the rolls of
each society will be called. Eacli
society will choose two members to
compete in these pieliminaries,and
as many as wish may enter the
lists from the student body and
compete individually fora place on
the team.
The societies must choose their
representatives bv Saturday, Cc
tober 9, and the secretary of each
society must inform Dr. Ross of
such selection by October 12. All
competitors from the outside must
hand their names to Dr. Ross by
6 p.in. Tuesday, October 12, as
entries will close at that time.
After the speakers have been
selected they will be assigned some
French subject for debate. The
speeches must not be over twelve
minutes in length. The speaker
may, if he wishes, divide his argu
ment, provided he consumes live
minutes on bis first speech.
The faculty committee has turned
the management of most of the
details over to the executive com
mittee of the league. It has started
a new departure in debating circles
this year by holding the prelimin
aries during ( lie first semester. This
was done in order to prevent the
double preliminaries and double
intercollegiate meets from coming
in the last semester and over
whelming our best debaters in a
rush of work.
