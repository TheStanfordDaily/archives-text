# Notice to Co-Op. Shareholders.

### 
The following letter from Profes
sor Brun explains itself, and we
hope that any who still retain
stock in the old Co-op. will comply
at once with the request made by
the writer:
My Dear Mr. Schwartz :
At the risk of being tedious I
again beg to say to the share
holders of the old Co-operative
Association that they would confer
a favor upon the trustees by mail
ing me their certificates of stock.
In case any one has lost his certifi
cate, he should drop me a line ask
ing fora printed release and 1 will
send the blank by return mail; and
on receipt of the release duly
signed, 1 will send amount to re
leasor. Yours very truly,
Samuel .1. Brun.
