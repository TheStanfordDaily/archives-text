### 
The Kirmess committee has se
lected Mr. Nash's farce "The Train
Robber" for presentation on (he
evening of the 29th of this month.
The principal man's part will he
taken by Prof. \V. 11. Hudson,
the principal woman's part by Mrs.
1). W. Murphy. The remainder of
the cast has not yet been fully de
cided upon, but the Faculty Dra
matic Company consists of the fol
lowing members (in addition to
those already mentioned), from
which a selection will be made:
Professors Allardice, Murphy, Fair
cloughjMr. Nash, Mr. Teggart, Mrs.
Davidson, Miss Fiske, Mrs. C. E.
Hodges. Mrs, Wm. 1\ Elliott, Mrs.
I Vine, Miss Schallenberger.
Dr. Jordan's duties on the Fur
Heal Commission will probably
make his presence necessary in
Washington about the end of this
month; therefore he will not be able
to appear as was expected, but his
part has been understudied and will
be well played. Ihe farce is in one
act andshort, consequently both au
dience and actors will have ample
opportunity to take in the many
other attractions of the Kirmess.
The scene of the farce is laid in
Woodside.
