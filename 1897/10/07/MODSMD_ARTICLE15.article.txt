During the second hour this
morning the Library was so crowded
that at least twenty-five persons
were obliged to stand. Many
others who desired to study there
at that time went away rather than
remain in the crowd. This hag
been a frequent occurrence lately.
The Library is not large enough to
accommodate those who are forced
by their professors to wade through
the books which are to be obtained
in no other place. Either the pro
fessors will have to be more tem
perate in their requirements of
"pages to he read, 1 ' or the facilities
for meeting these requirements will
have to be increased.
