By this time, at least, the Fresh
man Class should know that there
is a Freshman team, that this team
has been defeated in two games,
and that as yet it has received no
support or encouragement from the
class which it represents. It is also
an indisputable fact that the Fresh
man Class has little or no organi
zation, not even an official class
yell. There also seems to be a lam
entable lack of class spirit and
class unity among the freshmen.
When one considers that on Octo
ber 30 the intercollegiate Freshman
game takes place, the status of af
fairs at Stanford is alarming. The
team is well equipped and Avell
managed and the entire blame for
the lack of interest in the team's

success can be placed only on the 1
members of the class. Several
games are scheduled for the team
this week, and it should he the en
deavor of every freshman to accom
pany his fellow-classmen and help
cheer them on to victory.
