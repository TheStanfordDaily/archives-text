Academy and West Point to play
their annual football game this fall.
The game was prohibited by Secre
tary Herbert for two years.
—The Yale colony at Harvard is
growing rapidly and never before
contained so many distinguished
graduates as it does now. Many of
Yale's former athletes on track and
gridiron are now enrolled in the
law department there.
—The students of the University
of Virginia are making an effort to
raise a sum sufficient to procure a
bronze bust of Edgar Allen Poe, to
he placed in their new library and
to be unveiled on the semi-centen
nial of his death, October 7, 1899.
Poe was atone time a student at
Virginia.
—Yale and Harvard are placing
their men in practice preparatory
to active work on the gridiron. Of
this year's eleven at Yale there are
but two who played in the Prince
ton game last year, and they both
went in as substitutes. Forbes,
who is coaching Harvard, lias al

Yale defeated Wesleyan in foot
ball Saturday by a score of 80 to 0.
Harvard defeated Williams, score
20 to 0. Princeton defeated Le
high, 43 to 0. The Carlisle In
dians took a game from Dickinson,
by 86 to 0 University of Pennsyl
vania defeated the Bucknell team
by a score of 88 to 0. Cornell won
a game from Syracuse, score 16 to 0
— Vale met Trinity on the grid
iron Wednesday and in a loosely
played game of football won by a
score of 10 to 0. The game was
an important one from the fact that
it showed Yale's football possi
bilities for this year. Critics say
that if Vale is to make a respect
able showing against Harvard and
Princeton this year there is plenty
ot hard work before them.
