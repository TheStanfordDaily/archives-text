# Football Practice.

### 
The Freshmen were lined U]>
against :i combination of Varsity
and second eleven men last night
for their daily practice. Yose was
tried at quarter and did good work
both in passing and tackling. He
is the lightest man on the held.
The great faults of the team at
present are the lack of snap and
the lack of team work. The line
men, especially the guards, are too
slow and do not get into the plays
as they should. Mr. Brooke spends
considerable time with the team
and it should profit much by his
instruction. The Varsity and sec
ond eleven played two halves. Two
touch-downs were made, both by
the first team.
Smith was tried at half and both
he and Fisher made some good
runs. Captain Cotton was out
again and played in his usual good
form, making both touch-downs on
line bucks. Parker and Jeffs
both played good ball at end both
in running with the ball and in de
fensive work.
For the second team, Scoville and
Daly put up a good game and Wit
son made some good {units, though
some of his attempts were blocked.
James was tried on the Varsity dur
ing the latter part of the game and
did some good playing. The sec
ond team played with thirteen men,
an extra man being at left guard
and another behind the line.
The men lined up in the follow
ing positions:
