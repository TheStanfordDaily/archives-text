The fact that Stanford's Varsity
is to play its first match game of
the season in San Francisco to
morrow should induce a large
number of students to accompany
the team and cheer them in their
efforts to win a victory. Stanford
has always sent an enthusiastic
following to the city with its teams
and the spontaneous way in which
college spirit was manifested has
always been a source of wonder
ment to San Francisco spectators.
Tomorrow should not be an excep
tion. Stanford has a team worthy
of hearty support and this the stu
dent body should give it in tomor
row's contest.
