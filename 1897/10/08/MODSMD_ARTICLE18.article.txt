# New Men for Reliance.
## 
### 
Several prominent players have
joined the Reliance ranks and may
be seen in (he game with Stanford
Saturday. These are Oliver, Slieehy,
and Sherman. They are a trio of
clever players and will greatly
strengthen Reliance's team.
Slieehy has not yet tendered the
desired apology to Archie Pierce,
assistant coach at Berkeley, and
has not practiced with the U. C.
football squad during the week,
nor has he been seen on the campus.
Sheehy will probably be one of the
Reliance guards and "Pete" Smith
the other in Saturday's game.
Sherman is one of the Coast's
best ends, although he played half
back also last year and when he
was captain in 1895. Oliver was
guard on Reliance last year, but
has not yet donned a suit this year.
He is a formidable player.
Code, '96, has left for the mines
and Piatt may take his place, al
though the Reliance men would
like to see Harrelson, '95. play the
quarter-back position. Morse, Car
ter, and Frick will constitute the
other backs. With this team Re
liance will stand a good chance for
championship honors.
