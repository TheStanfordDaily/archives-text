# Pioneers in Frisco May Organize.
## 
### 
There are at present located in
San Francisco twenty-four gradu
ates of the class of '95, and twenty
one ex-'9s's. A Stanford'9s club
has heen mentioned as a probabil
ity in the city. The organization
would contain at least forty-five
members, including four former
presidents of the Pioneer Class â€”
C. C. Adams (ex-'95), George
Crothers, Archie liice, and Lester
Hindsdill. Such an organization
would be primarily for the main
tenance of Pioneer Class loyalty,
and would not in any way interfere
with the purposes of the San Fran
ciso Stanford Alumni Association,
organized last year with George
Crothers as president.
