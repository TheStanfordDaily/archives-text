# Berkeley Notes.
## 
### 
—The sophomore hop will take
place on the 22d of October.
— Reliance and Berkeley played
an hour's vigorous practice game
yesterday, hut neither attempted
to score.
— Whipple, '00, and Bias, '01,
the Beikeley men who were ruled
off the field for taking part in the
rush in violation of football regu
lations, have been reinstated and
will appear on the field again.
— Prof. A. 0. LeUschner of the
astronomy department at U. C. has
recently returned from abroad and
it is probable that he will succeed
Prof. Holden, who recently resigned
as director of Lick Observatory.
—Percy Benson, the veteran U.C.
quarter, and at one time captain of
the varsity, is captain of the Butte
team of this year. Butte will line
up this year with practically the
same men as last season, Hooper,
guard, and McMillan, ex-'97, being
the only exceptions.
—A. W. Ransome, captain of
last year's football team, is now
playing on the second eleven at
Yale. Last week he won laurels
for himself by scoring a touch-down
against the varsity. On account
of his four years's service on Cal
ifornia's team he is debarred from
taking part in any intercollegiate
contests. — Cniifnrninn.
