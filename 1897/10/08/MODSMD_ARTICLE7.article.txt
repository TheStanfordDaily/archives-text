Reliance will go into the game
with a team averaging pounds

fitted much by the experience of
last Saturday's game as well as by
one more week of team play. Dur
ing the week Reliance has practised
(signals a great deal, and each man
knows his place in every play.
The team will miss Code at quarter,
and the fumbling which may re
sult in his absence may give Stan
