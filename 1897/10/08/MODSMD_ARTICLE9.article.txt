Sheehy, the recreant football
player, is still on his 1 ugli horse
and has given the U. C. football
authorities just one day's grace in
which to restore him to the football
squad. If his case is not settled
by tomorrow he declares he will
quit and join the Reliance team.
Guiberson, the big freshman
guard, is developing wonderfully,
having distinguished himself in
the freshmen game with San Mateo
Tuesday. Simpson, tackle last
year, will try for halfback. Bender
and Haskell are having a pretty

contest for quarter. Kaarsberg is
being tried at end. Hopper and
Thane are at present playing
halves.
