# "VICARIOUS SACRIFICE."
## Dr. Amos G. Warner's Fourth and Last Sermon to the Students. 
### 
A large audience gathered in the
chaJ>el yesterday morning to hear |
the address which concluded thej
series of Dr. Warner's sermons to!
students. Prof. Warner spoke in
part as follows:
''Whatever else may be true of
them it is certainly true that the
religions of the world are not in
ventions but growths, and any
thing that is common to as many
of them ms is the doctrine of vicar
ious sacrifice presumptively re
flects conditions that are common
and jerhaps inevitable. This de
spised and abominated doctrine
that the innocent must suffer for
the guilty, and that under proper
conditions the guilty aie relieved
of some of the consequences of
wrong doing through the suffering
of the innocent, is not based wholly
upon religious dogma. To a very
considerable extent it represents
not a theory but a condition and is
nothing more than a straightfor
ward statement of fact, of what has
been observed to happen.
"That wrong doing has bad ef
fect, on others than the wrong doers
is too common and too commonly
observed to need much dwelling on.
The murderer w ho has been duly
hanged is not more dead than his
innocent victim, and about each of
them is a wide circle of relatives
and associates and fellow citizens
who must take more or less of the
consequences of both the misdeed
and its expiation. \\ bile it might
be very nice if all adults could take
the consequences of their own
action and of nobody else's, society
is not arranged that way. 'lie h;is
paid the penalty'we hear it said af
ter some noted debauchee or great
defaulter has committed suicide;
and then follows the reflection' Yes,
but how many others have paid it
with him.' Often the one who
makes a mistake or commits a
crime escapes most of the conse
quences. The engineer or builder
of a great dam is at fault, and the
people of Johnstown are swept out
of existence. W hen the tower of
Siloam falls exact justice would
prescribe that only the architect
and master builder should be under
it. But these worthies had no
doubt long since passed away.
'Think ye they were sinners above
all others on whom the tower of Hi
loam fell? I tell ye nay.'
•'Justice to individuals is not
Nature's specialty. Their lives are
too short for her to take much ac
count of them. Like the Greek
fates she exacts punishment for
wrong doing but frequently exacts
it from those who did not do the
wrong. Instead of making special
efforts to get only fit people born
into the world, Nature's way is to
bring many into existence and then
kill off those who do not suit. 'If
you want an omelet you must
break a few eggs,' said the Corsican.
'If you want the fit to survive you
must smash the unfit, and any
others who get mixed up with
them,' says Nature. This is effec
tive but looks wasteful, and it
certainly is hard on the unfit who
are pitchforked into existence with
out their consent, and then pitch

forked out again because they did
not happen to be something else
than that which they had been
made. Countless millions have
been exterminated merely because
they did not properly 'adapt inter
nal conditions to external condi
tions'; ami yet not one of them ever
understood that this was required
of them until Herbert Spencer said
so.
"Weak minds, like the friends
who tried to comfort Job, have often
taken the contrary view and have
insisted that suffering is always
and only the consequence of de
merit. But. any one able to look
squarely at facts, like Job himself,
has seen that this is not true, and
has given up trying to account for
existing conditions except by fall
ing back on faith in a higher power,
and 'believing where he can not see'
'that good shall somehow be the
tina I goal of ill '
"It should be said, however, that
as the wrong doer stands a little
nearer to the wrong than anybody
else he is somewhat more likely to
he hit by the consequences. In the
j long rtin and on the average this is
true. Were it not true no progress
would be made, and Nature would
be convicted not oily of brutality
hut of incompetency. This she
has never been Sermons from the
text 'The wages of sin is death,' can
he based on facts as well as scrip
ture. Because the innocent often
suffer, no one need to conclude that
it is a matter of indifference
whether or not he is innocent. Even
were the physical forces of the in
nocent and guilty the same, which,
j on the average they are not, con
science and public opinion would
make a difference greatly in favor
j of the innocent. Though the mur
dered man and the hanged niur
j derer are both dead, most of us
: would prefer to be the former rather
than the latter. Statute law is
continually running correction lines
through the conditions of life es
tablished by non-human nature;
doing what it can to make the lot
j of transgressors harder and harder;
j and the religions of the world lend
J their powerful aid in the same
; general direction.
"After stating this let us see if it
can be further shown thatany good
comes out of the great mass of un
earned suffering that falls upon the
relatively innocent individuals of
the world. This unmerited distress
can serve no purpose as a penalty
| or as a corrective. Is it a sheer
j waste? Why it comes, whether
from an unreasonable and malig
; nant deity or from a blind nature
we do not now inquire. There it
is. Is there any good in it? Is
there anything saved or salvahle
: from what looks like a mountain
of waste? We are trying, you
; will remember, to keep close to ver
! itable facts.
"From the great mass of unde
served suffering let us take out for
[examination that part which the
j sufferers have voluntarily incurred
; or have joyfully borne in order to
shield others from the consequences
of misfortune, or weakness, or
ignorance, or sin. The quantity of
this is not as small as cynics would
have us believe.
I "First of all there are the enor

mous sacrifices parents make for
their children, both among lower
animals and among human beings.
As the generations of men are
bound together by these heavy
debts which can never be paid di
rectly, but only by affection and
gratitude and the passing on of the
obligation to a succeeding genera
tion, so, in some sort do the sexes
stand related to each other. Super
ficially considered one of them
seems to have committed an undue
share of the sins of the world, and
the other to have borne an undue
share of the consequent suffering
More justly stated one of them has
served the race chiefly through ac
tion, and the other chiefly through
endurance. The history of the
physically weaker sex can be so
written as to read like one long
story of oppression and injustice.
But carefully considered much of
what looked like oppression is seen
to have no human origin, but to be
the result of forces which neither
sex could control —of those funda
mental forces which have shaped
our minds and bodies, and which
from the beginning decreed the evo
lution of sex. As this fact has
come to be recognized by both the
life of endurance has been trans
mitted into the life of power. The
glory of suffering gladly borne for
affection's sake has transformed
the woman and subdued the man.
Through all the years is every
manly man steadied and upheld
and strengthened by the thought
of those members <>112 the race who
do perhai>s less than he but endure
more. What he could not do for
himself or for selfish gain he is
willing to do for the sake of one
whose burden is different from his.
Thus the overplus of endurance
that falls to the lot of one sex be
comes if rightly received and borne,
a source of strength and affection
and joy to all, contributing to the
relation of the sexes much of that
which is purest and noblest in
them, and to the general endow
ment of the human heart an emo
tion fit to rank with parental and
filial love.
"In university communities we
hear much talk about the cultiva
tion of pure science and seeking
truth for truth's sake. Now of
course a man may seek truth for
ambition's sake, or for greed's sake,
or for any other selfish motive.
Mut if he makes real sacrifices for
the sake of establishing truth is it
not because he feels that all truth
is useful in one way or another,
now or later? Is he not bv the sac
rifices he makes doing something
to take upon himself a part of the
burden of the unearned suffering of
the world? Is he not striving by
the gift of himself to lessen the sum
of the world's mistakes and misdo
ings? And is not this distinctively
modern form of self-sacrifice one of
the best and most efficient forms?
The old self-sacrifice walked the
pestilential streets to aid the sick
land bury the dead. The new does
; the slow work of the laboratory
| which shall prevent the plague or
stamp it out forever. The Red
Cro'-s still has its heroes and her
oines but so has the cause of inter
national arbitration. The new sac
rifice is that which is given for pre

vention, admittedly better than
cure.
''Why is so much undeserved suf
fering in the world? I do not
know. But this seems clear, that
when any part of that suffering is
taken up and borne for love's sake
a new portion of moral health and
hopefulness comes in to strengthen
and to bless the world.

kill off those who do not suit. 'If
you want an omelet you must
break a few eggs,' said the Corsican.
'If you want the fit to survive you
must smash the unfit, and any
others who get mixed up with
them,' says Nature. This is effec
tive but looks wasteful, and it
certainly is hard on the unfit who
are pitchforked into existence with
out their consent, and then pitch

forked out again because they did
not happen to be something else
than that which they had been
made. Countless millions have
been exterminated merely because
they did not properly 'adapt inter

tions'; ami yet not one of them ever
understood that this was required
of them until Herbert Spencer said
so.
"Weak minds, like the friends
who tried to comfort Job, have often
taken the contrary view and have
insisted that suffering is always

squarely at facts, like Job himself,

has given up trying to account for
existing conditions except by fall
ing back on faith in a higher power,
and 'believing where he can not see'
'that good shall somehow be the

"It should be said, however, that
as the wrong doer stands a little
nearer to the wrong than anybody
else he is somewhat more likely to
he hit by the consequences. In the

true. Were it not true no progress
would be made, and Nature would
be convicted not oily of brutality

suffer, no one need to conclude that
it is a matter of indifference

what looked like oppression is seen
to have no human origin, but to be
the result of forces which neither

our minds and bodies, and which

willing to do for the sake of one

A large audience gathered in the
chaJ>el yesterday morning to hear |
the address which concluded thej
series of Dr. Warner's sermons to!
students. Prof. Warner spoke in
part as follows:
''Whatever else may be true of
them it is certainly true that the
religions of the world are not in
ventions but growths, and any
thing that is common to as many
of them ms is the doctrine of vicar
ious sacrifice presumptively re
flects conditions that are common
and jerhaps inevitable. This de
spised and abominated doctrine
that the innocent must suffer for
the guilty, and that under proper
conditions the guilty aie relieved
of some of the consequences of
wrong doing through the suffering
of the innocent, is not based wholly
upon religious dogma. To a very
considerable extent it represents
not a theory but a condition and is
nothing more than a straightfor
ward statement of fact, of what has
been observed to happen.
"That wrong doing has bad ef
fect, on others than the wrong doers
is too common and too commonly
observed to need much dwelling on.
The murderer w ho has been duly
hanged is not more dead than his
innocent victim, and about each of
them is a wide circle of relatives
and associates and fellow citizens
who must take more or less of the
consequences of both the misdeed
and its expiation. \\ bile it might
be very nice if all adults could take
the consequences of their own
action and of nobody else's, society
is not arranged that way. 'lie h;is
paid the penalty'we hear it said af
ter some noted debauchee or great
defaulter has committed suicide;
and then follows the reflection' Yes,
but how many others have paid it
with him.' Often the one who
makes a mistake or commits a
crime escapes most of the conse
quences. The engineer or builder
of a great dam is at fault, and the
people of Johnstown are swept out
of existence. W hen the tower of
Siloam falls exact justice would
prescribe that only the architect
and master builder should be under
it. But these worthies had no
doubt long since passed away.
'Think ye they were sinners above
all others on whom the tower of Hi
loam fell? I tell ye nay.'
•'Justice to individuals is not
Nature's specialty. Their lives are
too short for her to take much ac
count of them. Like the Greek
fates she exacts punishment for
wrong doing but frequently exacts
it from those who did not do the
wrong. Instead of making special
efforts to get only fit people born
into the world, Nature's way is to
bring many into existence and then
kill off those who do not suit. 'If
you want an omelet you must
break a few eggs,' said the Corsican.
'If you want the fit to survive you
must smash the unfit, and any
others who get mixed up with
them,' says Nature. This is effec
tive but looks wasteful, and it
certainly is hard on the unfit who
are pitchforked into existence with
