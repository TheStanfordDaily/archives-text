One of the features of the game
in the city Saturday was.the en
thusiasm displayed by the Stan
ford spectators. A like exhibition
of college spirit has not been wit
nessed on the college campus this
year. The yelling was heard every
time Stanford made a gain, and
also at critical points of the con
test. No yell leaders had been ap
pointed, but several volunteers
proved very efficient. The true
Stanford spirit which every Stan
ford student is proud to possess was
manifested on this occasion by
every man who accompanied the
team to the city.
