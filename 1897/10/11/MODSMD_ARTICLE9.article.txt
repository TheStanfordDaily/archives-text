# Varsity vs. Reliance.
## 
### 
The Varsity won its first match
game by a very narrow margin.
Reliance had the better side of the
argument so far as superior play
ing was concerned, but Stanford
had the points. It was a close,
hard game right from the start.
The line bucking was terribly
heavy and several of the men were
bruised up.
Reliance put out a team of vet-,
erans, such a team as has been sel
dom seen before upon the Coast, i
They all played ball like veterans
too, and nothing of that hesitancy
and tendency to fumble, exhibited j
to such a considerable degree one |
week previous, was anywhere in
evidence. Sheehy, the would-be
Berkeley student, was out at right
tackle and put up a strong game,'
especially on the offensive. The'
one point where Stanford excelled
to a most noticeable degree was in j
punting. Murphy, although handi- j
capped by very poor passing,
kicked in fine form and gained !
ground on every exchange of punts.
Carle kicked off for Stanford and
Morse ran it in. Carter and Morse
made pretty runs around the end,
but Stanford settled down and took
the ball on downs. Murphy made
a long low punt which passed the
Reliance fullback and bounded into
touch on the five-yard line. Re
liance kicked to the center of the
field and Stanford worked the ball
to the twenty-live yard line, where
after some see-sawing the ball went
to Reliance. Then came the play I
that scored. Carter dropped back I
fora punt, Jeffs broke through, (
blocked the kick, and Ilea Smith, j
picking it up on the dead run. with
the : nterference of Jeffs and Fick
ert, ran it in square behind tlie
goal posts. Murphy kicked the
goal. No score was made during
the remaining part of the half.
In the second half Reliance
bucked the ball through center and
left tackle, aided now and then by
a slip around the end by Eddie
Sherman, until the two-yard mark
was reached, when Arlett went
through Burnett fora touch-down.
On the punt-out, Reliance lined
up behind Code, who was to catch
the ball, instead of before him,
where they could interfere for him.
Code was knocked over and Mur
phy, who was on side, caught the
ball. Score: Stanford 6, Reliance, 4.
The remainder of the half was
spent mostly in Stanford territory,
the ball being close to the line
three different times. A wrangle,
in true prep.-school fashion, took
place on the ten-yard line, but no
harm was done and the men had a i
good rest.
The weakest part of the Varsity
seemed to be in the left side of the
line. Several times large holes |
were opened in the center through j
which the Reliance backs plunged
until stopped by Cotton. \\ ith
bucks or tackles it was different.
Rice went under the plays every
time and worked like a Trojan, but
was opposed to the star tackle of
the Reliance team, and that to
gether with the backing of a light
man at half was the principal
cause of the athletic club gains in
that quarter. Carle and Thomas
put np a fine game, both handling
their men well and out-playing
them.
Parker played a rather erratic
game, doing poor work in the be
ginning but toward the last picking
up and making some of the neatest
tackles on the field. Smith put up
the best game at the end. lie used
his head to good advantage and
broke up many of the plays which j
came around his end. He was J

handicap;" <1 to sun:c exit.it l>) a
lame leg and was unfort hum u
enough to injure hoiii n. i.k !<
and knee again. Fisher and C'<»l l< n
both bucked well, Colton making
some particularly good gains.
Fisher's bucks were good, though
he sometimes ran into his own
tackle instead of hitting the hole
squarely. Murphy put up a star
game at quarter, passing, punting,
and running well with the ball.
His tackling, though not clean and
sure, was low and generally stopped
the runner. Jeffs was a little out
of his place at half but did well
nevertheless.
One noticeable point displayed
by almost every man on the team
was in high tackling. The Re
liance men played well together,
the backs getting into action
quickly and interfering well. The
end runs of Sherman and Code's
interference were the most notice
able points of their play.
