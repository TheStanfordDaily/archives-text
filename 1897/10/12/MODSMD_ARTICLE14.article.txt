The University Bookstore has
added a department of miscella
neous books as an experiment
Books in general literature will be
sold at a discount of about twenty
per cent, from regular prices. At
this rate little profit can lie made
unless sales are very good. If the
new department is not found profit
able it will be discontinued at the
close of this semester. Those who
have occasion to buy this class of
books would do well to patronize
the faculty store and encourage the
continuance of this new line and at
the same time make a slight saving
in the cost of books.
