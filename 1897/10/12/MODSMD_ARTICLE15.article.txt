Believing that those who have
been continually talking about the
necessity of placing signs on the
paths leading from the University
to Palo Alto directing pedestrians
and wheelmen to their proper sides
were in good earnest and that
they were willing to do their part
towards providing them, we offered
a few weeks ago to receive any con
tributions toward the expense of
this work which members of the
student body and faculty might
wish to make, and also volunteered
to see that the wishes of the con
tributors were carried out. Our
action met the approval of a good
many, and two members of the fac
ulty and <> 1 ie student expressed
their approbation by making sub
scriptions. Members of our stafi
increased the amount subscribed
to one dollar and a half, but that
is as far its the matter has pro
gressed. Are we to understand by
this waning of interest that all we
have heard about these signs was
mere idle talk, that there is no ne
cessity for them; or is it that those
who have done so much talking
want to see the improvement made
but do not want to help?
We would suggest that the mat
ter be settled at once. Mr. Hodges
has made the signs and will place
them when painted. This leaves
but the painting to be done by us.
The total expense of this will be

four dollars. If the signs are
really wanted, this amount should
be speedily raised. We do not care
to send our staff out soliciting, but
its members are authorized to
receive subscriptions for these signs
when such are voluntarily given.
