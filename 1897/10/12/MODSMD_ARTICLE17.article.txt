# "Senior" Thoburn's Committee Again
## 
### 
We recently published an item
from Harper's Weekly concerning
the student's committee of which
''Senior" Thoburn was chairman.
Another example of how the facts
have become distorted is the follow
ing clipping taken from the stu
dent's paper of the University of
Nebraska:
"Williams College has established
a precedent by restricting the stu
dent body in numbers. This has
lately been followed by the Uni
versity of California. President
Jordan of the latter institution
has placed authority in ihe hands
of a student committee to cull out
all worthless and undeserving mem
bers, thus giving greater advantage
to those who come for study. This
is the tirst check on the great rush
for numbers."
