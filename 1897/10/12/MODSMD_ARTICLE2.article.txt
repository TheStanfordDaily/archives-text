# Light Work Last Night.
## 
### 
The men were somewhat sore
from Saturday's game yesterday
afternoon and the work was light.
The team lined up for practice in
formation of kick-off plays and
spent tlie entire afternoon in that
work. Rice was not out on ac
count of injuries and James played
Jeft tackle. Carle did the kicking
for the second eleven and all the
men were given opportunities to
run with the hall. Parker and
Jeffs showed up in good form in
getting down the field, and
Murphy's punting was up to his
usual standard.
