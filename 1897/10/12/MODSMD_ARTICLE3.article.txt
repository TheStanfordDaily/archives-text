The Daily I'alo Alto has bee.i
requested to give its readers some
thing of the history of the paint
ings which form such an attractive
feature in the University chapel.
Of these paintings ail but one are
copies of famous works of art. The
one original painting is the one en
titled 'The Resurrection," painted
by Benjamin West.
There are five copies taken from
Raphael. "The Marriage of the
Virgin" hangs at the left of the
"Resurrection" and is one of
Raphael's earlier works. The
painting in the rear of the room is
"The Madonna del Baldacchino."
It was designed for an altar piece
and is especially fine on account of
the excellent portrayal of the boy
angels who are holding the scroll.
At the right of this painting hangs
a more beautiful picture, "The
Madonna of the Goldfinch," which
is called the "Gem of Florence."
"The Transfiguration" hangs op
posite the left entrance. It was
the last work of Raphael and
was finished after his death by sev
eral of his pupils. The original is
now in the Vatican. Over the left
entrance is Raphael's "Madonna
del Granduca." This is one of the
best of the Madonnas. At the left

of Raphael's "Madonna del Baldac
ehino" there is a copy of Alberti
nelli's "Visitation of Mary and
Elizabeth." The original is in the
Uffizi Gallery at Florence.
The most beautiful picture for
its size hangs over the right door.
It is taken from Andrea del Sarto's
'"St. John." At the right of West's
"Resurrection" hangs a copy of
Carlo Dolci's "Magdalen." The
"Immaculate Conception" hangs on
