Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Jt lias become necessary once
more to bring the Choral Society to
the notice of the general University
public, and I take advantage of
your columns in order to do so.
It is quite impossible for the
chorus to he carried on successfully
unless a genuine student interest
lies behind it, and it perhaps seems
futile to endeavor to create such an
interest. Certain is it that no
amount of talking or of writing will
do any good unless a real love for
music already exists. But it has
become clear that many among us
do not even know of the existence
of such a society in our midst,and
in that fact this letter finds its
justification. It is to the lovers of
music that we appeal; to those who
may not know of the opportunities
the Choral Society offers.
The society has struggled on with
varying success for two years past;
it has now a small memhership, is
in debt, and may he forced to dis
band unless some forty or fifty new
members can be secured. And yet
all who have been members and
have joined in singing tlu> grand
choruses of Handel, Haydn, and
Mendelssohn, bear ready testimony
to the delight and inspiration the
work has been to them.
We are a community of busy in
dividuals, it is not always easy to
take an evening from our work,
and there are many things that
claim the hours we give to relaxa
tion. But though the main work
of many lies on other lines, few, I
hope, dare to live without literature,
without poetry; and we ask help in
furthering the efforts of this society
in fostering among us a love also
of music.
The society meets in the chapel
at 7:30 on Wednesday evenings.
The evening is, I believe, to he
changed to Thursday, but due an
nouncement of that will be made
by those who have the matter in
charge. We earnestly ask all who
are interested, or who are lovers of
good music, to give its their co-op
eration and the support of their
presence, whether or not it seems
to them possible always to attend.
Particularly do we need more
women's voices, and it is in the
power of the young ladies of Roble
to confer a real boon upon our com
munity by lending the chorus their
support.
Thanking you for the space you
have allowed me,
Yours very truly,
A. T. Murray.
