# The 						Sophomore Meets.
## 
### 
The Class of 1900 met in the
chapel at half-past one this after
noon. The report of the committee
appointed to consider the advisabil
ity of holding a sophomore-fresh
man reception reported through
[. J. Egan (chairman) and F. B.
Braden. The committee saw Dr.
Wood and he took the question
of a dance to Dr. Jordan. Inas
much as it is Mrs. Stanford's
wish that there lie only the four
class dances during the year and
also because permission for other
dances had already been re
fused, the committee thought it
diplomatic to drop the subject. As
the committee had investigated the
matter and did not believe the re
ception would be a success without
a dance, it reported unfavorably.
I'he class as a whole looked at the
matter in the same light and after
accepting the report the meeting
adjourned.
