take action in the matter of the j
election of a baseball manager, j
The Athletic Committee which had
the original charge of the election I
of that official failed to elect on a
tie vote, hut one ballot being taken.
The matter was then dropped by j
adjournment and the president of
the Associated Students called for
a decision of the matter by a gen
eral election to be held Thursday j
between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.
In the meeting of the Executive I
Comnrttee this afternoon it wasl
ruled that the matter of the elec- ;
tion of a baseball manager could!
not be taken from the jurisdiction I
of the Athletic Committee until the :
first of November. This ruling is j
based on Section 8, Article II of the
Constitution of the Associated
Students which provides as follows:
"It shall be the duty of the Ath-'
letic*. Committee to elect in the month j
of October a manager for baseball
* * * and a manager for track at h

in the hands of the first elector un
til the first of November. The
candidates for baseball manager
are Roy N. Strohn and F. V. Kees
