We would like to suggest, if it is
not too presumptuous on our part,
to the morning papers of San
Francisco a method of head-lining
whereby the Stanford news would
not appear under misleading head
lines. A morning paper made it
appear that the track manager
elected yesterday was "Varsity
track captain," and the manager of
the Freshman football team was
made "Freshman captain." The
temporary track manager was
made ''temporary track captain."
By allowing their correspondents at
Stanford to draw up provisional
head-lines, containing the suit
stance of their articles, and then
having these revised by the men on
the paper whose duty it is, these
journals would appear to belter ad
vantage in this community at least.
