These columns have been used
in calling attention to the lack of
enthusiasm at football practices
until we are almost ashamed to say
anything further about the matter.
It does seem to us, however, that
something ought to be done in the
matter, both bv those at, the head
of the student body interests and
by the students themselves. At
tention has been repeatedly called
to the lack of yell leaders and con
cert yelling. It has been the cus
tom in former years for the presi
dent of the Associated Students to
appoint persons who may be called
upon to lead the cheering. It
ought to be possible for this to be
done ibis year, and the names

gliould be published immediately.
It seems to us that at least one
man from each of the upper classes
would l>e sufficient at present. No
one likes to volunteer to lead the
yelling, and it is safe to say that it
will not he done without the author
ity of appointment. Some of us
are complaining of the lack of en
thusiasm among players, hut the
players themselves are probably
nearer the source of trouble when
| they complain of lack of support.
