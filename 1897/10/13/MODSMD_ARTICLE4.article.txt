# Varsity Practice.
## 
### 
The Freshman and Varsity teams
were out for the usual work yester
day afternoon. The weather was
cool ami sharp, especially after live
o'clock. The play, however, was
for the most part slow, only toward
the last did the men liven up so
that play was interesting.
There were several changes in
the accustomed line-up, Rice and
Parker playing halves on the tirst
team and Fisher fullback on the
second. Burnett and James were
also on the second. James played
left tackle, taking Kice's place, and
was run for several good gains.
Parker showed up in fine shape at
half. He is a quick starter and a
strong runner, doing equally well
on end runs and line bucks. Wil
son played behind the line on the
Varsity and showed up well in his
work. His tackling though strong
is, like that of many others on the
field, too high.
Fickert excelled in offensive work
last night, making one pretty run
of forty yards from the first kick-off.
Fisher. Scoville, and Leavitt put
up the best game for the second
team. Fisher bucked well but his
tackling is still too high; Scoville
and Leavitt are both hard workers
and put up a good game. Murphy,
Wilson, and Cotton were put in
toward the end of the practice and
the ball was worked up the field
almost to the line but no score was
made.
Toward the latter part of the
practice a small knot of students
under the leadership of "Chri.-."
Bradley, encouraged the players
with the yell.
The following is the line-up:

Ilea Smith, '99, who has showed
np so well at end this year, will not
be seen on the field for at least two
weeks and possibly not for the rest

rarily at least.
