## "THE OCCIDENT" RAVED AT "CERTAIN VENOMOUS INSINUATIONS." Now Eugene Sheehy Has Left California to Play Football With Reliance. 
### 
Last Monday's Daily California n
contains the information that Eu
gene Sheehy has left the University
of California to play football with
Reliance. The name Sheehy re
minds us of an editorial which ap
peared in the Occident of Septem
ber 24. It was given due notice in
the city papers under glaring head
lines while still fresh from the ed
itor's pen, but the Daily Palo Alto
paid no attention to it at the time.
Since Mr. Sheehy is no longer con
nected with the University of Cal
ifornia, we presume that there is
now no reason why we should not
give our readers the benefit of this
brilliant piece of literature. We
print it below in full:
"The Daily Palo Alto of the
17th contains certain venomous in
sinuations as to the purity of our
athletics. The Stanford attacks
begin in the following editorial:
" 'The matriculation at Berkeley
of Sheehy, the Olympic guard oi
last season, raises the question of
his eligibility to the freshman
team, lie spent two or more years
at Santa Clara College and received
some credit for that work at Berke
ley. It is almost a certainty that
he will be on the Thanksgiving
team. Whether or not that hat
been the main reason for his sud
denly entering Berkeley at this
particularly opportune time can
better be determined next term
when his services will have ceased
to be immediately necessary. Mean
while the situation presents a
problem in foot-ball ethics.'
"To which, with all dne respect,
we can answer that the situation
presents no problem at all in foot
ball ethics. Sheehy is a regular
freshman at Berkeley and will play
on the freshman team if able to
make it. He has no advanced
standing; it is far more difficult to
gain advanced standing at Califor
nia than can be imagined at Stan
ford.
"As to 'his suddenly entering
Berkeley at this opportune time,'
we must acknowledge that we
understand not this objection. An
entrance is always sudden —atleast
at California. One does or does
not matriculate; a candidate cannot,
as in some other institutions, pro
long his endeavors at the require
ments through two or three years
of actual athletic work before final
rejection. As to 'opportune time'
we beg leave to remark that this
'opportune time' is the time at
which all students at Berkeley
matriculate —at the beginning of
the college year.
"In fact the only grudge against
Sheehy is that there may exist a
possibility of his leaving college
next term. This may happen to
anybody and is easily exemplified
by* this clipping from the Palo
Alto of the 9th inst:
" 'Freeman, '99, Kerrigan, '00,
and Burnett, '00, will not return to
the University this semester.'

"From which it appears that
autumn is not a 'particularly op
portune time' for the two greal
Northern track-and-field athletes
who pass the spring at Palo Alto.''
Further on in the same issue of
the Occident the following appears:
"Our worthy colleague, the editor
of the Daily Palo Alto, in order
to sustain the dignity of his alma
mater, has deemed it necessary to
cast a few of his customary libels
upon one of our players whom the
Stanford management was unable
to secure. Without any other ap
parent reason he infers that Mr.
Sheehy has entered the U. C. for
the sole purpose of playing football
[sir], and that he has no intention
of remaining after the close of the
football season. 'Meanwhile,' he
remarks, 'the situation presents a
problem in football ethics.'
"Whatever may be our opinion
of the author of such an un
warranted calumny, we cannot but
conclude that his inference must
have been based upon some prece
dent, and we need go back no
further than his own Palo Alto of
t.\e 9th inst. to find a very suggest
ive example of the domestic prac
tices upon which this ma}' readily
have been founded. In it we find
the following news item: 'Freeman,
'99, Kerrigan, '00, and Burnett, '00,
will not return to the University
this semester,' —since, applying the
logic of our Palo Alto friend, as
enunciated by him in a moment of
forgetfulness a week later, 'their
presence at the University is of no
immediate necessity.'
"To add insult to injury, he pro
tests, against Sheehy's elegibi 1 ity to
the freshman team on the grounds
that iie played for two years on the
eleven of Santa Clara College.
Though he may wish to persuade
us that that college is on a par with
his own, we cannot accept his argu
ment as long as a Santa Clara
graduate is entitled to no higher
rank than that of freshman at the
University of California."
