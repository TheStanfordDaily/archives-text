To many women of the Univer
sity probably the idea has never
presented itself of entering a de
bating society. They take for
granted that, because they are
women, they are not fitted to speak
in public, and so go on blushing
and stammering and answering in
weak, wavering voices when called
upon to recite in the class-room. A
young man, on the contrary, as
soon as he enters college, becomes a
member of a debating society, or
at least ought to, with the distinct
purpose of improving his ability to
think and express himself logically.
The result is that there are live or
six societies for men and only one

for women. Even though a young
woman never expects to say a word
before a public audience, she has
yet endless opportunities to use a
little argumentative ability; and
practice in debating, inasmuch as
it makes her able to say clearly
and logically what she desires to
say, is important. Instead of one
society there should be several, and
the women, especially those who
are likely to go out from the Uni
versity and take teachers' positions,
should not be slow to enter them.
If the men need them, the women
need them more.
