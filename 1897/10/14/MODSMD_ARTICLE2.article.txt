# The
						Punt-Out Dispute.
## 
### 
In view of the discussion which
has arisen on account of the deci
sion in the Reliance-Varsity game
concerning the punt-out it might
be well to state the question
plainly. "Pete" Smith of the Re
liance team calls attention to rule
8 of the "Football Rules" which
states that "a fair catch" is a catch
made direct from a kick by one of
the opponents or from a punt-out
by one of the same side. Smith
says that the rule states plainly
that there shall be no interference.
The rule continues: "If he (the
player) be interfered with by an
opponent who is off side . . . there
shall be a penalty." The rule
states distintly that there shall be
no interference by men who are off
side, but does not say anything
whatever about men who were on
side, freely admitting that all men
on side have an equal chance to
catch the ball.
. The facts of the case are, that
Code placed himself about five
yards from the goal line, with no
men at all between himself and the
goal line, the Stanford men being
themselves on side ran out, Smith
and Burnett bowling Code over,

and Murphy catching the ball. All
of which they clearly had a right to
do, being on side. The mistake,
made by the'whole Reliance team,
was in not lining up in front of
Code in order to keep him from be
ing interfered with. The very fact
of the opposing team rushing for
ward upon the man who intends to
make a fair catch of the punt-out
shows that there must be some
reason for his being protected.
Mr. Brooke when spoken to con
cerning the matter, made the state
ment that he had, a short time ago,
received a letter upon this very
point from Paul Dashiell, a mem
ber of the Rules Committee and
that the decision was perfectly
correct.
