Many of the men were not out
for practice yesterday afternoon,
Fickert, Parker, and Smith being
laid off for various injuries The
men have been working very hard
this year, harder perhaps than has
been the custom for the iirst part
of the season, but it is now over a
month since practice was com
menced and they are beginning to
I'eel the effects of the work. There
were but twenty-one men on the
field at the beginning of regular
practice and Mr. Brooke was com
pelled to do the punting for the
second team.
The second team kicked off.
Murphy dropped the ball, but pick
ing it U}) he went through the en
tire field doing some neat dodging
and making one of the prettiest
runs of the year. The team set to
work to play a kicking game, the
Varsity breaking through well and
blocking one of Mr. Brooke's kicks.
Carle was put on the second eleven
and played a good defensive game;
his tackling .was hard and low.
Daly was out for the first time in
several days and will soon be in
his old form. Rusk was put out at
end on the Varsity and did well at
the new position. Scoville, Leavitt,
and Erb did good work on the sec
ond, Leavitt getting down the field
fast on kicks, and tackling well.
Erb's game at quarter is improv
ing, his tackling is hard and his
passing, considering the changeable
make-up of the second team, is very
good.
Toward the last of the game the
Varsity settled down and bucked
the second eleven down the field to
within about two yards of the line,
where Wilson was sent around the
light end for a touch-down.
The teams lined tip as follows:
vausity. second team.
