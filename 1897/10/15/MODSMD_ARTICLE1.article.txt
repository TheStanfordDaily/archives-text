# ON THE GRIDIRON.
## Much Improvement Shown by Individual Players. 
### 
There were several members of
the Freshman team out yesterday
for signal practice, but the team as
a whole did not line up fora signal
practice game.
There is no reason whatever why
there should not be two teams from
the class out every day, in order
that the eleven which represents
the class in the intercollegiate con
test on October 80 may have some
thing which resembles team work.
Yesterday's Varsity practice was
made more interesting and more
profitable by putting Carle and
Fickert on the second eleven.
Murphy kicked off for the first half;
the ball being worked backward
and forward, no score was made
and when the intermission was
called honors were about even.
Cotton made some good bucks and
James two good gains, one of which
netted the second eleven almost
fifteen yards.
Carle opened the second half by
kicking off to Murphy, who fum
bled and dropped the ball. Varsity
punted well down the field, Burnett
getting down before the ends made
a pretty tackle. Second eleven's
ball. Wilson punts thirty-five
yards. Murphy, on the Varsity's
first down, sends it back to Bur
ineister,vvho makes a good run from
the catch.
The second eleven team settled
down to running tactics, Rusk go
ing around left tackle lor a good
gain and Scoville making ten yards.
Beekley breaks from the mass and
runs almost sixty yards before
being tackled by Wilson; the
second eleven gets the ball and
Wilson again punts fora good gain.
Murphy sends it back for fifty
yards to Erb, who then made the
prettiest run of the day and one of
the lest seen on the held this sea
son. After running fifty yards and
being tackled by Murphy he passed
the bail to Scoville, who with
James' interference crossed the line
for the only touch-down of the after
noon.
As to the work of the individual
men, Wilson's punting showed the
greatest improvement. His kicks,
though several were difficult to
make, were reliable and all gained
good ground. Murphy also punted
well, his kick on two occasions
gaining over fifty yards. Erb's
tackling is also improving, being
bard and low.
The men lined up as follows:
Beekley 1 end r Ilili
Rice 1 tackle r Husk
Adams 1 guard r Carle
Burnett center Biglovv
Woodruff r guard I. . . . Fickert
