The Freshman team plays a
match game in Ban Jose tomorrow
and the Stanford people who live
in San Jose s \ould endeavor to at
tend if possible in order to give the
team some encouragme.it. As
many members of the Freshman
Class as possible should also ac
company the team. Students com
plain of the lack of spirit which the
team shows, but the lack of support
which the team receives on its trips
and in its games from the Fresh
man Class and the student body is
even more manifest. Yell leaders
have been appointed by the class
and an effort should be made to in
still some enthusiasm into fresh
man football.
