# SATURDAY'S GAME.
## Berkeley Ties Reliance on the San Francisco Field. 
### 
Saturday's contest between Berke
ley and Reliance gives to a certain
extent a basis fora comparison of
the two university teams. Reli
ance went into the game with live
positions held by other men than
those who played the preceding
week against our own Varsity.
Welles at guard, Sexton at tackle,
and Code, Arlete, and Morse behind
the line did not appear in the first
line-up although Morse and Arlete
were substituted toward the latter
part of the game. Berkeley's team,
too, was not the same which played
Reliance two weeks before and
there can be no doubt in the mind
of one who has seen both combi
nations play, that Saturday's
line-up was the much stronger of
the two. The field though harder
and firmer than it was the Satur
day before when Stanford and Re
liance played was yet too dusty,
having been watered the night be
fore.
U. 0. kicked off for the half
Carter running the ball in ten
yards. Reliance worked the ball
to Berkeley's thirty-yard line where
Jlall made his two great runs net
ting nearly thirty yards for bis
team. Again the big men from the
athletic club fought their way
down the lield, big ''Pete' Smith
going through Berkeley's line and
around the end for good gains.
Berkeley got the ball and Cap
tain Hall raced down the field
fora fifty-live yard run, passing or
knocking over every Reliance man
in his way; all was clear fora
touch-down, but Eddie Sherman
coming up from behind neatly
downed him, thereby taking away
Bekeley's opportunity for scoring.
'I he ball was held fora time in
Reliance territory but some bucks
by Felton Taylor and a good run
by Siieehy brought the ball near
the center of the field, where after
an exchange of kicks it remained,
time being called for the first half
with the ball on U. C.'s forty-yard
line.
In the second half Reliance
kicked off to Berkeley's five-yard
line, Kaarsburg making a clear
run of twenty yards before being
tackled. Kaarsburg punted for
forty yards and Allen getting the
ball on a fumble carried it twenty
live more. California bucked the
ball over, but Kaarsburg missed a
goal and the score was 4-0 in favor
of the collegians.
The ball was brought back to the
center of the lield, Reliance kicking
off for thirty yards. Greisburg
made five yards around the end
and California punted for thirty
five yards and, after two downs
and a fumble by Reliance, kicked
for twenty-five more. Steady bucks [
by Reliance brought the sphere to j
Berkeley's four-yard line. Carter j
punted, the ball rolling over the
California goal line. The ball was
brought out to the twenty-five yard
line and punted by Kaarsburg ten
yards over the center of the field.
The ball after being bandied back
and forth near the center was taken
on steady bucks, and by some end
runs by Percy Morse, to within i
seven yards of California's line,

' where there was a pile-up, every
body thinking that the ball was
down; but it wasn't, and Middle-,
i mas grabbing it from the mass,
dashed across the line fora touch
down.
' In bringing the ball out fora try;
;at goal, Reliance moved it over j
i from the side, square in front of
the goal posts and although the
ball went between the bars the goal |
was not allowed by Referee Carle.
Kaarsburg kicked off to Reliance's!
ten-yard line and Arlett and Morse
brought it back past the center of ;
the field by brilliant runs to Cali
fornia's twenty-five yard line,
where play stopped when time was
called for second half.
The Reliance eleven did not put
; up as good a game as on the previ
jous Saturday, none of the new men
i [(laying up to the standard set by ,
those who were laid off. Halt's
work at quarter, though conscien
tious, was not in the same class as
Code's.
California showed tip well at the
lends and behind tlx- line. Craig,
j Griesburg, and Hall were the par
ticular stars. Craig, though not in.
I the best condition, played a hard |
'game, getting through the interfer
ence and tackling well. Griesburg
|at his new place behind the line
I •showed up well, breaking through
several times and blocking the Re
: liance play. Hall played by far
the best individual game of the
day. His tackling was low and
hard and his offensive work, as
shown by bis runs, was excellent.
As could be plainly seen after;
the game was over, Berkeley's hopes
i have risen, and they now have
great confidence in the ability of!
j their team to hold our Varsity 1
down on Thanksgiving day.
