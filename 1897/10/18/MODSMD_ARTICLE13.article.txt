We regret that the Freshman
game with the University of the
Pacific at San Jose Saturday had
been advertised in the papers and
posters of that city as a "Varsity
game." The crowd that attended
the gitme had been brought there
by a desire to see the Stanford
Varsity in a football contest. The
responsibility for this strange error
can not be placed upon the Stan
ford management, as the advertis
ing was left entirely in the hands
of the managers of the University
of Pacific team. Even the Uni
versity of Pacific people can not be
wholly blamed for the mistake, as
it appears that they placed the
matter in the hands of the man
agers of the football grounds. They,
it seems, gave full sway to their
imagination and transformed the
Stanford Freshman team into the
Stanford Varsity. The most seri
ous feature of the whole affair lies
in the possibility that it may be
believed that Stanford deliberately
perpetrated such a cold-blooded
fake upon the San .Jose public. The
relations between Stanford and San
Jose have always been cordial, and
should continue so in the future.
The genuine Stanford Varsity will
appear at San Jose on the 30th of
this month in a game with Reli
ance, and the people of San Jose
will then be given an opportunity
of witnessing a Varsity game of
football.
