# Preachers Object to Football.
## 
### 
The fortieth annual conference!
of Methodist preachers, held in
Philadelphia, Pa., last week, openly
denounced football as brutal and
debasing. Dr. Cotton Amy of
East Bangor, Pa., said: "Football
certainly tended to degrade my
son, and it injured him morally to
a noteworthy degree." Dr. T. C.
Reade, president of Taylor Univer-
sity, Upland, Ind., offered this
prayer: "God save us from any
class spirit that would lead to haz-
ing, and from the deadly bane of
secret fraternities, baseball nines,
and football teams!''
