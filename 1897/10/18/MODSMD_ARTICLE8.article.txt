â€” Persons who believe in the im-j
practicability of a college education
should lie gratified at the allowing
made by Cornell in the experiment
of raising potatoes. On an unfer
tilized piece of ground 800 bushels
to the acre were raised, and on a|
piece of ground fertilized at a cost 1

of $20 :iii acre 320 bushels were
raised. The best previous crop of
potatoes in New York averaged 120
bushels to the acre. College edu
cation seems practical.
