# A 						GOOD PRACTICE.
## Varsity Men Taking a Livelier Interest in the Work. 
### 
The practice yesterday afternoon
showed a decided improvement
over the work of last week. The
men played with more energy and
snap, tackled better, ran better, and
showed in every way a livlier inter
est in the work.
Parker was out again, his foot
being much better. Ben Thomas,
of last year's second eleven, was
out for the first time, playing
with the second eleven.
The teams were evenly matched,
and, with the exception of one
touch-down made by Thomas after
a long run with a fumbled ball, no
score was made by either side.
Carle and Fickert, the Varsity
guards,were played with the second
team and both did good work,
Carle tackling well Fisher showed
great improvement in his work,
breaking through several times and
getting the runner behind the line.
He did some good punting for the
Varsity, Murphy not playing on
account of a sore neck.
Manlev played quarter on the
Varsity and did fairly well; he is
new at passing but should develop
into a good man for the place.
Hill showed up well at end on
the second eleven. He runs well
with the ball and will with prac
tice make a good end.
Scoville played half on the Var
sity doing good work both in offen
sive and defensive play.
The Freshman team had some
signal practice but did not line up
as a team.
