Music lovers at the University
have now been given fair warning
that unless their support is immedi
ately forthcoming the Choral
Society must disband. It is very
much to be regretted that this or
ganization should be neglected and
allowed to go down after so much
patient effort was put forth to start
it here. If there are enough stu
dents at Stanford who are interested
in music to make the chorus a suc
cess, they have not yet disclosed
themselves. If they have been
holding back for any reason they
should linger no longer but rally
to the support of the Choral Society
while there is yet time to save it.
