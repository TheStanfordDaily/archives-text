In this column some time ago
the attention of new students was
called to the different ways of
looking at cheating in examina
tions here and in preparatory
schools. Up to this time no new
cases of cheating have been dis
covered and it is presumed that
any who might have thoughtlessly
offended through ignorance of the
real nature of the offense have had
no inclination to take unfair ad
vantage of their fellow-students
when made to realize that they
were in an institution which "exists
for the training of men and women.' 1
There remains one thing more
which it is necessary to impress
upon the members of the Freshman
Class. Stanford University is not
the place for idlers. Already some
of those who entered the University
with the new class have been
dropped from the institution for
cutting classes and neglecting
work. Stanford has room only for
the most deserving. Freshmen
who know themselves to be deserv
ing should get to work now and
stay here. There is no denying
the fact that those who do not show
an interest in their work are doomed.
