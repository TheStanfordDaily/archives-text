# German View of Stanford.
## 
### 
Stanford University has received
attention in two recent German
magazines. In the Deutsche Rund
schau for July there is an article on
"Conditions in California." In
describing the educational advant
ages of the state it mentions Stan
ford. After tracing the history of
the University and describing its
equipments and methods it notes
some of the faculty. It says,"The
president is Starr Jordan, the best
ichthyologist of the United States
after Theodore Gill, an especially
prolific author and delightful lec
turer. Next to the governor he is
the best known figure in Califor
nia." Of the German members of
our faculty it says, ''Languages are
likewise well cared for at Palo Alto,
especially German which is carried
on by Goebel and Rendtorff. The im
petus which these two have given to
the study of German in California
through their enthusiasm for their
department is extraordinary. Also
in English, strange to say, one of

the head professors is a German,
E. Fltigel, a member of a family
widely known for its learning.
Connected with the University
there is a magnificent museum of
which Schlobach of Liepzig is
curator."
In the Deutsche Litteraturzeituvg
for August 14 appeared an article
l>y Professor Putzker of the Uni
versity of California on ''German
in America,"in which the author
speaks in terms of highest praise
of Dr. Goebel and especially of his
efforts to secure the Hildebrand
Library.
