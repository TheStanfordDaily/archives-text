# KIRMESS ATTRACTIONS.
## The 						Executive Committee Secures Many Novel Amusements. 
### 
At a meeting of the executive
committee of the Kirmess held last
evening the matter of side shows
and other amusements for the Kir
mess was considered.
The farce by members of the fac
ulty will be presented in the north
room at 8 p.m. and will continue
for three quarters of an hour. Im
mediately following this a vaude
ville show will be given in the same
room by some of the best known
students of the University.
Other features will be the "Lul
laby of nations," given under the
charge of the ladies of the faculty,
and a Ja F lanese room where co-eds
in the costumes of the Japanese
will serve tea.
What promises to be decidedly
unique is the "freak" show where
everything usually classed in such
a category will be on exhibition.
This feature of the Kirmess will be
under the management of students.
Among other interesting features
will be "The Egyptian fortune
teller" and"The Postoffice."
A grand promenade concert will
continue during the evening. Re
freshments will be served in the
large south picture gallery. A large
committee is at work on the decor
ations and something elaborate in
this line is expected. Mr. Timothy
Hopkins has promised a number of
plants and flowers to be used for
this purpose.
