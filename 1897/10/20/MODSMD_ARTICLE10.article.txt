# Freshmen vs. Santa Clara.
## 
### 
The Freshmen will play what
will probably be their lust practice
game before they meet Berkeley,
next Saturday afternoon at three
o'clock on the campus. The op
posing team will be the Santa
Clara College eleven, which defeated
the University of Pacific eleven at
San Jose two weeks ago. As the
Freshmen have also defeated U. P.
the teams should be well matched
and the game interesting.
The Freshman eleven will line
up much as they expect to go
against Berkeley. The visiting
team will be considerably heavier
than the Freshmen, it being thought

advisable to put the "infants"
against as much weight as possible
to prepare them for California's
heavy line. Santa Clara College
is noted this year for its bucking
backs and will doubtless give the
Freshmen here some trouble. An
endeavor is being made to get
another game fur the "babies" the
first part of the week with either
Hoitt's or San Mateo.
