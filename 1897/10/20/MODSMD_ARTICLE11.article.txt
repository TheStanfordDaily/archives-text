There are achievements in col
lege journalism as large in propor
tion as those in the large field of
world-wide journalism. Two West
ern college papers recently dis
played creditable enterprise in
their journalistic labors: the U. of
M. Daily and the J)aily Cardinal
of the University of Wisconsin.
The recent visit of President An
drews of Brown University to Ann
Arbor gave the editor of the U. of
M. Daily an admirable opportun
ity for "scooping" the local and
city papers and he took it. lie se
cured a long interview from Presi
dent Andrews, which, in view of
the prominence into which Presi
dent Andrews has been thrust on
account of his recent difficulties with
the trustees of Brown University,
made interesting reading to say the
least. The local daily did not con
tain a word about President An
drews, and the correspondents of
both the Detroit and Chicago dai
lies were completely "scooped."
The Daily Cardinal, published
at the University of Wisconsin, is
not at all lacking in enterprise.
Recently, in order to call the atten
tion of the students to an impor
tant mass meeting, the purpose of
which was to make arrangements
for the annual football game with
Minnesota, the Cardinal staff
worked all night to get out a spec
ial edition of the paper, which was
printed in cardinal, the college
color.
