The young women are striving
in vain to secure proper recogni
tion from their masculine fellow
students in many of the co-educa
tional institutions of this country.
In most schools they are still de
nied the right of participating in
many of the departments of uni
versity life. Recently the young
ladies of a certain large university
asked to be allowed to take charge
of an issue of the college paper, and
were denied the privilege. We do
not know whether the young ladies
in question were incapable of issu
ing a creditable paper or whether
they were refused on grounds of
insubordination. Be that as it may,
we believe that the young ladies of
Stanford could issue a paper which
would reflect credit upon themselves
and upon the University, if given
an opportunity, and we are going
to offer them the opportunity with
out the asking. If the young ladies
of this University show a willing
ness to do so they may assume en
tire editorial control of one issue of
the Daily Palo Alto at any time
they may choose between now and
the close of the semester and say
anything they please in its columns.
The regular staff will step out for
the time being and turn the office,
and the printers, and the printers'
"deviF over to them. It remains
now for the young-ladies to decide
whether or not they desire to take

advantage of this opportunity to
give expression to their opinions
and see that their particular in
terests are for once fully repre
sented. If sufficient interest is
shown in the matter steps will be
taken to have a representative staff
of young ladies chosen to take
charge of the edition.
