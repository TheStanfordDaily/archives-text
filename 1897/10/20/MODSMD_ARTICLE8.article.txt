# VARSITY IS IMPROVING.
## The 						First and Second Teams Still Show Signs of Progress. 
### 
The Varsity team work still con
■ tinues to improve. Last night with
| the addition of Carle and Fickert,
i who have been playing with the
second team for several days, two
touch-downs were make against the
second team. The second eleven
also continues to improve and is
much stronger now than formerly.
James was moved over to the
Varsity and showed up very well,
making some good gains in offen
sive play. Rice on the second also
put up a good game. Hill and
Erb were placed on the first team
and both put up a fair game. Jeffs
j put up the best individual game of
the afternoon, especially on the of
fensive, making three brilliant
runs, one of which netted almost
thirty-five yards. Wilson, Thomas,
Partridge, and Daly put up the
best game for the second.
On the whole, great improvement
was shown in the interference. The
halves, however, still show a ten
dency to go at the ends in too easy
a fashion and often let them slip by
and go running down the field
after the man with the ball has
been tackled.
All the men were out last night
with the exception of three of the
ends—Smith, Parker, and McFad
den. Smith and Parker will be out
in a few days,but McFadden's injury
to his knee and ankle is liable to
keep him from getting out for the
remainder of the season.
