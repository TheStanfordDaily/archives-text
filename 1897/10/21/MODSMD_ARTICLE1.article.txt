The heavy down-pour of rain to
day failed to put the least damper
on the political proclivities of the
student body, as was evidenced by
the large vote polled. Enthusiastic
partisans of the nominees were on
the quad at work at an early hour.
During the progress of the election,
groups of interested students dotted
the corridors, but the chief center
of interest was the voting place.
Here the forces were congregated.
