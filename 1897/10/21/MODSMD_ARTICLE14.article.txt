We publish in another column a
communication from a member of
the board of directors of the Stu
dents' Guild. No one in the least
acquainted with the nature of the
work done by this organization
can doubt fora moment the im
portance of giving it adequate
support. It is strictly a student
organization and should be sup
ported by each member of the
student body at least to the extent
of fifty cents a semester.
