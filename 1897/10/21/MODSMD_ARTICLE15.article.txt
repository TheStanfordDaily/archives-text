It seems as if college politics
might be carried on decently. In
almost every student body election
there is some unfounded charge of
corruption or indecency started
which is perhaps believed by but
few persons and does nothing but
disgust a great many more and
make them wonder if education
after all has much of a tendency to
make people fair-minded and truth
ful. In the politics of the outside
world where the "bosses" are "not
in politics for their health." it is
not so surprising that in the heat
of a contest unfair means are some
times resorted to. But in college
politics where every candidate may
almost always be safely assumed to
be a gentleman who has the wel
fare of his college at heart, there is
not enough at stake to lead sensi
ble people to stretch the truth
to carry a point. Those of us who
have happened to fall in the way
of active political friends of the two
gentlemen whope names were voted
upon today have learned more evil
of them than we would ever have
suspected. The gentlemen them
selves were not responsible for these
stories and each declared that he
believed his opponent to be per
fectly upright in character. It is
never the candidates themselves
who promulgate these slanders, but
over-zealous supporters. The evil
is due to excessive partisanship.
There was one story in particular
circulated today which we feel free
to refer to now that the election is
over. If it is true, the person of
whom it was told should not be in

Stanford University. If it is un
true, those who started it should
not be allowed to remain here.
