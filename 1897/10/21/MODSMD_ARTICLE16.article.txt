all the leading college elevens this
season except Harvard. Except
ing one player, Lone Wolf, the

the trouble between the colleges
over the game of 1894 the faculties
will not permit a game until all
the students who were then in col

they hope to cause all hard feelings
to die out.
—Cornell upperclassmen have
prohibited freshmen from smoking
pipes on the streets of Ithaca and
from smoking at all on the cam
pus, have debarred them from three
restaurants after 7 p.in. unless ac
companied by upperclassmen, and
have decreed that the freshmen
shall not carry canes or wear silk
hats.
