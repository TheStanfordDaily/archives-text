The October Century contains
articles of very interesting and even
exciting character. Such is Theo
dore Roosevelt's justification of his
principle of taking politics out of
the police management in New
York, and making promotions ac
cording to personal prowess. It is
illustrated with anecdotes from"the
1101l of Honor."
"Marie Antoinette as Dauphine"
is written in the new light of state
papers of Vienna. One can scarcely
imagine the annoyances the pretty
and winning dauphine had to suf
fer.
The question, "What is an Au
rora?" is discussed by Alexander
McAdie. The colors may be the
result of a combination of argon in
the upper air under electrical con
ditions which are dependent on
sun-spots. A brilliant display of
auroras is predicted for 1908.
"Campaigning with Grant," by
General Porter, contains a moving
account of General Lee's surrender
and the close of the war.
The beautiful romance of "The
Days of Jeanne d'Arc" concludes
with Bert rand's discovery of the
execution of La Pucelle.
Several "Letters of Dr. Holmes 1 '
to his classmate, Isaac E. Morse of
New Orleans, are published for the
first time, of which the most in
teresting is the last. It was
written at the outbreak of the
Civil War.
