The work yesterday afternoon
was good and poor in streaks. The
Varsity backs seem to find trouble
in forming their interference prop
erly and often stumbled over one
another in their attempts to get
around the ends. Once or twice
when they did succeed in getting
around good gains were made. The
second eleven was strong and no
touch-downs were made by either
side.
Carle kicked off for forty yards
to Burmeister, who ran it in ten
yards, the Varsity ends being very
slow in getting down the field.
Second eleven made no gain and
punted twenty-live yards to Mur
phy, who by a pretty run carried
it back thirty yards. Scoville
went around the right end for ten
yards, and Cotton bucked the line
for four more. With the ball on
the ten-yard line, Murphy tried for
a field goal but failed. The ball
was brought out to the twenty-five
yard line, where Burmeister punted
to Scoville. He fumbled, but made
five yards. Carle went around the
left end for ten yards more. Mur
ply punted 20 yards. Ben Thomas
went around theend for four yards.
Second eleven could not gain

through the Varsity line and Bur
meister punted over Murphy's head
for forty-five yards. Carle was
sent around the left end and made
a line thirty-yard run, being
downed from behind by Morgan.
Second team's ball. Burmeister
punted thirty-five yards, Wilson
missing the ball, and Murphy by
clever dodging bringing it back ten
yards. Neither team had the ad
vantage. Murphy punted, Erb
making a fair catch. On the kick
Hill made a clever run of fifteen
yards, diet Thomas went around
the left end for ten. Time was
called with the ball on the second's
forty-yard line.
Carle, Thomas, and Hill put up
the best game for the Varsity,
while Ben Thomas and Morgan
excelled in individual work on the
second.
