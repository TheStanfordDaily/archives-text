# THE
						JUNIOR CLASS HAT
## 
### 
Class of '99 Decides Against the
Sombrero and Adopts the Plug.
The Class of '99 met in the
chapel this afternoon and adopted
the plug as a junior hat. At a
previous meeting of the class the
Mexican sombrero was adopted, but
owing to the fact that it would be
necessary to buy two sombreros,
one this year and another next, it
was decided to follow the good old
custom and wear the plug.
Mr. Whitaker, chairman of the
auditing committee of the Annual,
stated, upon the advice of Professor
Whittier of the Law department,
that in order to make the bond of
the manager perfectly valid it
would be necessary for it to be ac
ceptable to the class and to have
the names of all those voting in
favor of the acceptance of such a
bond recorded. The rules govern
ing the manager were amended to
fulfil these requirements and the
manager's bond was accepted.
Miss Tucker withdrew her name
from the committee on junior hats
and Mr. Yost was appointed in her
place.
