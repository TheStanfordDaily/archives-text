The Students' Guild subscription
for the present semester falls short
of previous subscriptions quite ap
preciably. It has been suggested
that this follows from ignorance on
the part of the students generally
as to the work and purpose of the
guild. That this may be no longer
a cause fora lack of interest, the
board of directors wishes to pub
lish the following statement.
The present purposes of the
guild are two, both in keeping with
the original intention of providing
a hospital service for the campus.
In cases of emergency, either from
accident, acute il Iness, or contagious
disease, it is evident at a glance
that our isolated position is a dan
ger. This danger has been well
illustrated on Severn 1 occasions.
One case of acute sickness was ser
iously endangered by the necessity
of a removal to the city for necessary
treatment and care. In this case a
slight jar would have resulted fa
tally. The lack of necessary ap
pliances in several cases of accident
has materially affected the chances
for perfect recovery. Contagious
disease is quite unprovided for.
There is now no means for isolating
the patients in such a way as to
give them the best of care and at
the same time protect the student
bod v. The cosmopolitan character
of our student body makes the
chance for contagious disease more
than a slight one.
Of course what is needed is a
well equipped hospital. To this
end the guild has established a
building fund which is at this time
a fair sum of money. At present,
however, the erection of a hospital
is out of the question. All that
the guild is able to do in the mean
while is to provide some emergency
materials, which are in the charge
of the department of Hygiene and
placed conveniently on the campus.
The other way in which the
board has found it practicable to
assist in cases of sickness, is in the
matter of temporary loans. Stu

dents who would suffer for want of
necessary medicine, nursing, and
treatment with which for the time
they are not able to provide them
selves, are helped by the guild.
Such assistance necesarily has to
be allowed with discretion. Chronic
sickness is not provided for, only
cases of accident and acute sick
ness being considered within the
scope of the guild's work. This
has been of material help to a
number of students who otherwise
could not have had the necessary
care.
This will serve to outline the
work of the guild at the present
time. A slight consideration of the
subject must make clear the neces
sity of some such work for the stu
dent body. From the individual
standpoint it is but a sensible in
surance against personal risk,
while to the extent that it is char
itable it is conservative and in the
right direction. From any point
of view, it merits the interest and
as.-istance of all the students.
