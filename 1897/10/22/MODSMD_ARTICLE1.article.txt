# CARNOT DEBATE.
## All the Questions Now Chosen for the Preliminary Contests. 
### 
All of the questions to be de
bated by the candidates for places
on Stanford's Carnot debating
team of 1898 have been chosen.
The questions all relate to some
French political question and thus
are in line with the policy of Baron
Coubertin in founding the Carnot
Debate—that of creating an inter
est in French politics among the
students of Stanford and the Uni
versity of California.
On the evening of November 1(5
two debates will be held. The first
section has chosen for debate on
that evening the following ques
tion: ''Resolved, That a Franco-
Prussian alliance would be for the
best interests of France." The de
baters in this section are S. \V.
Charles (chairman), Miss Kath
erine Adams, C. H. Chandler,
Thos. Mackay, and H. B. Crocker.
The question for the second de
bate of the evening is: "Resolved,
That the French policy of 'revenge'
for the defeat of 1870 and the mili
tary system necessitated by that
policy have injured France." In
this section are G. H. Yost, (chair
man), O. O. Hickock, 11. Lea,
Charles Quale, and A. 11. Suzzallo.
On November 20, there will also
be two debates. Members of the
third section will debate the follow
ing question: "Resolved, That
France should adopt a more ag
gressive colonial policy." Those in"
this section are .J. M. Switzer (chair
man), H. \V. Grunsky, A. B Mor
gan, J. F. English and (1. C..Miller,
The last debate of the series be
tween the members of the fourth
section will be on the question:
"Resolved, That France should
choose the friendship of England
rather than that of Russia." IS. H.
Rothrock (chairman), J. M. Oski
son, Miss Anna Strunsky, L. B.
Wilson, and H. G. Whitlock are in
this section.
The debaters will not be given
their sides until two days before
the preliminaries as it is desired
that contestants prepare on both
sides of the question, and also be- i
cause the Carnot Debate is supposed
to be in a measure extemporaneous.
An effort is being made by the j
debaters to have the executive,
committee of the Inter-Society De- j
bating League postpone the pre-,
liminaries until after the inter
collegiate football game. The de
baters hold that the preliminaries
as arranged at present come off too
near the big game when the team
and its prospects are the only top
ics of general interest. In their
opinion the ends desired in holding
the debates this semester would be i
attained by holding them after
Thanksgiving day.
