Owing to the muddy condition
of the football lield there was no
regular practice yesterday. The
two teams lined up east of the
held and each practiced signals for
about three-quarters of an hour.
Parker was out at his old place at
right end, Leavitt playing on the
other end. Murphy and Carle
practiced punting and place-kick
ing as usual. Burnett still fails to
get the ball back in good shape.
This must be remedied soon, as it
is a matter of many yards 011 a
punt.
