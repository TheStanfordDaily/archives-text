There seems to he a misunder
standing among many of the stu
dents regarding the true nature of
the Kirmess which is to be given a
week from tonight. A number of
students are going in fancy costume
and the idea has gone abroad that
those who have no costume for the
occasion would better stay away.
The truth of the matter is that
those who have charge of the Kir
mess do not want many of the
students to wear costumes and
would in fact be disappointed if all
of them appeared in fancy dress.
The Kirmess is strictly a University
affair. No one person nor anv par
ticular class is more concerned in
the arrangements for this event than
any other. The presence of every
body in the University is desired
and it is desired also that every
student feel himself at home, no
matter how he chooses to go.
