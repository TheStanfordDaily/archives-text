# TOMORROW'S GAME.
## Stanford and Reliance Will Meet a Second Time in 'Frisco. 
### 
The Varsity will line up against
the Reliance Athletic Club team
tomorrow at three o'clock.
! Two weeks ago we won from lle
liance by a score of 6 to 4. One
I week ago California tied them by a
score of 4to 4. Tomorrow's game
will determine in the eyes of many
j the status of the respective teams
! and will without doubt be a good
! indication of the present condition
of all three teams.
While Reliance will not put
against us the same team which
tied Berkeley, it is safe to say that
it will not be weakened by the
I changes. Well's leg has recovered
j and he will be seen either at center
i or tackle, and Wyekoff, who entered
the University this fall, will prob
ably be seen at quarter providing
"Tommy" Code does not return.
If Code plays Wyekoff will go to
full. With Carter and Percy Morse
at halves the combination of backs
j will be a strong one. Erskine is to
! play tackle if able, but in case he
I does not Burnett will be played
j against his namesake, and Wells
i shifted to tackle.
The Varsity will be somewhat
j crippled by the loss of the regular
'ends-, Jeffs and Smith. Parker has
|so far recovered from the trouble
j with his foot that he will be seen
atone end, and Leavitt, who has
been putting up a stiff game at half
| and end on the second team, will
j hold down the other end position.
Thomas and Rice will be in their
; old positions at tackle, though it is
quite possible that James will be
[ given a chance to play before the
j game is over.
Carle, Burnett, and Fickert will
form the center trio and can be
j counted upon to hold their own
i against their immediate opponents.
Carle's work during the past week
has been excellent. Fickert is a
; triHe slow, no doubt on account of
j being slightly stale. Burnett is
playing fairly good ball, but will
; have to keep Reliance from plug
ging such large holes through him
|as they did two weeks ago. His
passing to Murphy is very poorj
indeed and has the bad effects of:
j both making Murphy nervous and
causing him to he liable to fumble.
Behind the line, Murphy will J
1 play his old position and Fisher |
land Daly 'will be the halves. I
Fisher has improved during the 1
past week very appreciably, but his;
• tackling is still too high. Captain
, Cotton will play fullback and can!
be counted upon for some good'
line-bucking.
On the whole, Stanford backs
should put up a better offensive
game than they did in the lirst Re
liance game two weeks ago, while
not so much can be expected of the
ends. The Reliance never will
play a much better game than they I
did last Saturday with California, j
The contest should be as exciting:
from a purely sporting point of
view as the game to be played on j
Thanksgiving day.
The Varsity will line up against
the Reliance Athletic Club team
tomorrow at three o'clock.
