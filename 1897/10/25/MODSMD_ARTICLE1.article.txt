# RELIANCE DEFEATED.
## Athletic Club Team Clearly Outplayed by Our Varsity. 
### 
Reliance will not take an Eastern
trip. The two defeats administered
by our Varsity has materially
changed Captain Frick's plans and
the chances arc now that his men
will be left to practice with the
university teams on the Coast. Two
weeks ago the two elevens were
almost even, the odds being, if on
either side with Reliance; but Sat
urday's game has demonstrated be
yond a doubt that our team is the
better and, what is more important
to us, that it has improved greatly.
The left side of the line, which ap
peared so weak in the previous
game, braced up wonderfully with
the changing of Fisher from right
to left half, and now Rice will be
assured of good backing.
It was a kicking game from start
to finish and Murphy clearly
showed his superiority over Wyckoff
who did the punting for Reliance.
The work of Wyckoff was by no
means of a poor quality and toward
the latter part of the game, when
his kicks were higher, he showed
himself superior to his opponent in
placing. Murphy also dis
tinguished himself in another line
by his fast running and clever
dodging, something which though
known to us has not been shown
in any of the previous match games
this year.
Three new men played their
first match game on the Varsity
and all showed that there will be
some strong bidding for the posi
tions which they played. Leavitt
in particular showed great form.
He was always well down the
lield, tackled fiercely often throw
ing his man back; and his run on
a blocked kick gave Stanford her
only touch-down. Morgan and
Daly also played a good game,
Morgan's speed being well shown
in the manner he went down under
Murphy's kicks. Daly, although
he has but lately recovered from an
injury, played a strong game at
half; though his abilities were not
very thoroughly tested by the style
of play which was used. Capt.
Cotton also played a star game on
the offensive. Ilis interference is
improving and he bucked the line
with the vim which characterized
his play last Thanksgiving day.
Rice and Thomas played a good
game at tackle though Thomas'
work was not quite up to his usual
standard.
Following is the line-up:

The center trio still continues to
improve. Carle and Fickert at
guards showed that they have no
equals on the Coast and their work
continues to improve steadily.
Burnett at center played in

much better form than he did in
the last game. His passing was
better, as was also his defensive
work in the line. His chief fault,
however, is in getting off side. wh : ch
he continually did and which he
must overcome. Fisher at half
also played in good form and much
of the ground which Stanford
gained was due to his efforts. His
defensive work also was of a high
order. Scoville when substituted
for him held down the position ex
tremely well for such a light man.
.James the other substitute who
took Rice's place at tackle did very
well and showed that theTe will be
a hard fight for that position. He
is heavy and has been playing an
excellent game lately.

The whole Reliance team played
good ball and it is doubtful it they
could put a stronger team in the
field. Sheehy, Carter, Morse, and
Wyckoff were the backbone of the
club's play, while the other men on
the team were not equal to their
opponents.
