It should be borne in mind that
students and members of the fac
ulty will he admitted to the Kir
mess for twenty-live cents if tickets
are purchased beforehand. Out
siders and all those who obtain
tickets at the door will be charged
fifty cents. Students will do well
to secure their tickets immediately
not only for admission to the Mu
seum but also for admission to the
farce and vaudeville. The number
of tickets sold for these two per
formances will be limited and
those who wait too long will run
the risk of failing to secure them.
