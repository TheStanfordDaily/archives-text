The sensational report in one of
the San Francisco papers that one
of Stanford's most reliable football
men was to desert the team in or
der to join ihe ranks of an Eastern
college, is, as might readily have
been guessed, utterly without
foundation. No overtures have
been made to ex-Captain Firkert
and even if he entered an Eastern
college this year he could not play
football on account of the one
year's residence rule in effect there,
according to which players from
other colleges must acquire one
year's residence before being al
lowed to be a member of any var
sity team. The whole story shows
the densest kind of ignorance on
the part of the writer.
