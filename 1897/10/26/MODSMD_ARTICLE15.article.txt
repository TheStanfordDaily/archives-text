The musical clubs of Stanford
should begin to realize that they
contribute greatly to the success of
the Thanksgiving clay events. The
University Band is one of the fea
tures of the game. The Orchestra
and the C*lee arid Mandolin Clubs
contribute their share in the
Thanksgiving night show. This
fact should not lead the members
into the indifference into which
several of the organizations have
fallen, but should on the contrary
cause them to fullil their duties
with more energy and willingness.
The Bin d and the Orchestra at
present need faithful attendance
and diligent work at rehearsals or
the successes achieved by these or
ganizations in the ])fist will be

marred by failure when they
make their public appearance this
year. Every one who is qualified
in a musical sense to play in either
one of these organizations should
come to the rescue of the leaders
and aid them in their endeavors to
make a creditable showing. The
student body luis been liberal in
its financial support and the mem
bers of the clubs should see that
their musical achievements are
worthy of Stanford University.
