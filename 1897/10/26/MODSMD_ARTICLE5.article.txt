Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Your kind but melancholy edi-j
torial on the Choral Society takes
too gloomy a view of its prospects. 1
it would have been accurate a few j
weeks ago, but now the society '
seems to have turned the corner.'
We have an enthusiastie and able:
leader, and a loyal membership.;
It seems likely that arrangements 1
can he made by which the CJlee [
Club will join us, in which case we'
shall have male voices enough to;
balance at least one hundred and '
fifty sopranos and altos.
What we need is women's voices. !
We have had forty or fifty sopranos, i
in squads of five or ten at a time, ?
every lady being scared :it, the 1
sound of her own voice in so small
a company and never coming!
again. We have had a dozen altos,
none at all, or two or three, at a
meeting. Now, if the ladies who
have come would only all come at
once we should have a chorus
formed; though we should still lack ,
for women's voices.
The Choral Society is not asking
for members ns a favor or from a j
sense of duty. Choral singing is!
a delight, a recreation, an inspira
tion, and an education. It affords
the very elements most needed in
our university life â€”spontaneous
self-expression and artistic plea
sure. Young women especially
should be quick to appreciate the
opportunity offered them bv the
society. If they are kept away by
a false conscientiousness, poring
over books and greedy for hours of
credit, then they are less liberal in
their views of an education than

one would expect from Stanford
students.
The fee to the end of the semester
is a dollar. We wish it were
nothing, but we have to pay our
expenses and it takes planning to
do it.
Everybody is welcome to come
to the chorus once or twice to see
what we do. The tirst night is al
ways the least interesting, because
of ihe strain of learning the music,
but we believe if people came twice
they would almost always stay.
We ask you. Mr. Editor, to pub
lish a number of pointed short not
ices, day after day, calling atten
tion to the low fee, and to the need
of sopranos and altos.
We want all Roble at the re
hearsal next Wednesday.
Yours respectfully,
H. H. Lath hop,
Chairman Ex. Com.
