The practice last evening was
light, the Varsity spending most of
its time in running through the
signals. The Kreshman teatn and
the second eleven lined up fora
short time in whirh tin* Freshmen
showed up very well against their
heavier opponents. J he \ arsity
men who were out hist evening
were, Burnett, Carle, Fiekert,
James, llice, Jeffs, Fisher, Daly,

and Cotton. The men have not yet
i recovered from Saturday's game,
and consequently were not given
any hard work. The Freshman
! team will have no more hard work
this week, after today. The time
remaining before their game Satur
day will be devoted to the forma
