The bare mention of the fact
that the Stanford Varsity is to
play a game with Reliance in San
Jose next Saturday and that the
musical clubs give a concert at
San Jose on the evening of the
same day should be sufficient in
ducement to every Stanford student
living in San Jose to help in every
way to secure a large attendance
at both events. If every student
living in San Jose will boom both
the concert and the game, no doubt
need be felt as to the outcome.
The game will be a high-class ex
hibition of football and the concert
will lie well worth attending. Sat
urday is Stanford day at San
Jose and the cardinal should be
everywhere in evidence.
