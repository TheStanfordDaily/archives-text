The papers of the University of
California announce that the fresh
men from there will attend the
game next Saturday in a body to
support their team. Although
cheering can not win a game, it is a
great satisfaction to the men in the
fight for their university to know
that they are supported and this
may inspire them to the effort
which brings victory. The Stan
ford freshman is not usually the
type of man that is caught off
guard, and Berkeley's challenge to
team support should be taken up
by every first-year man. Let every
freshman go to the game in San
Francisco next Saturday, and give
the team the encourncenient,

which it so richly deserves, (live
the University yell rather than a
class yell. The class yell may,
however, be put in at intervals.
