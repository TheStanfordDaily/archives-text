# Chainless Bicycles.
## 
### 
In the old League Chainless it
i was found that, though the whole
I wheel was of inferior workmanship,
[the bevel gears showed the least
wear of any part. The gears fit
and run apparently as well today
as they did three years ago. Be
ing protected from mud and dust,
lone great cause of uncleauliness
1 ami wear was eliminated. Also,
: from the nature of gears, the teeth
on each of the two engaging parts
j always keep exactly the same cir
i cumferential distance apart so they
j tit even after wearing. Every ob
serving person can see that, wi'Ji
J the chain wheel, wear increases the
; distance apart of the engaging sur
! faces in the chain, though not in
j ihe sprocket.
The Pope Mfg. Co. has been man
ufacturing, experimenting, and
testing chainless bicycles for over
two years and controls all of the
important patents of chainless bi
cycles and the machines for their
manufacture.
By using nickle steel tubing the
necessary stiffness is obtained with
| out making a heavy bicycle.
The I'ope Mfg. Co. has already
two years'start of any American
firm manufacturing chainless
j wheels and has already sold one
i fifth of its possible output for
1898.
Our order from the University
was the tiist one received by the
Coast Branch for Columbia ehain
j less wheels and we expect samples
! from the East any day. San Fran
cisco already is exhibiting Colum
bia chaiirless whee'.s. The price of
the chainless wheel is $125.
We are always able to supply
good grades of chain bicycles from
i the lowest prices up.
