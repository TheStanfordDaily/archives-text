The game which was scheduled
f'ir yesterday afternoon lu-tween the
Freshmen and Iran Mateo did not
t ike place owing to the inability of
San Mab'o to play. The regular
practice of the Varsity was inter
esting, the team showing good
form. The afternoon was devoted
largely to the practice of team
plays.
Burnett was nit. out and Iliglow
played center for the Varsity.
Parker and Leavitt were the Var
sity ends. Parker played a line
game, going through the interfer
ence and tackling very well. Leav
itt plays better on the offensive
than on the defensive, and yester
day he was easily blocked, lliil of
the second team m iking some good
ga ins a round him.
Fisher was slightly injured dur
ing the first part of the game and
P. Smith was substituted for him.
Two touch-downs were made on
the second eleven, the center plays
being always certain of gain, and
fora time two extra men played
with the second. Rich, '94, who
played tackle in the first Thanks
giving game was on the field try
ing to instil some of the old-time
enthusiasm into the players.
The line-up was as follows:

Rea Smith, '99, who played the
second half last Thanksgiving in
.Jeffs' place at end, has been com
pelled to stop playing football by
Ins father. His physical condition
has b< en very poor during the
whole semester and it was by the
advice of Dr. Wood that this last
step was taken. Smith has put up
one of the best games on the field
and was relied upon to bold down
one of the end posit ions on Thanks
giving day. Mis withdrawal will
be a great Jusa to the team.
