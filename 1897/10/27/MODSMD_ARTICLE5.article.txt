# THE 						FRESHMAN GAME.
## New Men of the Two Universities Will Meet Next Saturday. 
### 
The Freshmen are now putting
the final touches otr the team pre
paratory to their big game with
the freshmen of the University of
j California next Saturday. The
! play of most of the individual
members of the team is good, but
the team is sadly lacking in point
of interference and team work.
The game in the city next Sal
| unlay should be an interesting one.
The Berkeley "infants"' have been
more fortunate in their practice
| games than have the cardinal
I eleven, and from lines that are
■drawn on the teams when they
have played the same "prep.'
school elevens, U. C. has a decided
advantage. The odds are also in
I favor of Berkeley as to weight. The
Stanford I're.-h men are not to be
awed, however, by a little differ
ence in weight, and will go into
the game in fairly good condition
land with a determination to win
I Captain Manley may not be able
; to play on account of a serious in
i jnrv to his hip received in one of
j the practice games against the sec
ond eleven. In such a case his
1 place behind the line will be taken
| by Wardall, a dashing player who
! has shown up well in practice.
On the same day as the Fresh
man game the Varsity will play
Reliance at San Jose. The man
-1 airenient. in attempting to have a
big game in San Jose this year has
|in view the creation of an interest
1 in the game of football, which San
| .lose has lacked up to this time
If tin; game is a success an attempt
I will be made to have at least one
big game each year in San Jose.
