# AN INVESTIGATION.
## Dr. Warner Desires the Aid of Students in Collecting Interesting Statistics. 
### 
The class in Personal Economics
is making a study of student ex
penses and related facts at Stan
ford. It is desired to collect the
facts regarding the manner and
cost of living from as many indi
viduals as possible, and the co-op
eration of students is asked. A
blank is published today which
students who have been one year or
more at college are requested to fill
out and send under seal to Profes
sor Warner. 'J he schedules may
be either sent through the postof
lice nr left at room 20 quad.
The communications will be
treated as strictly confidential, the
part of t he schedule above the dotted
line being detached from the re
mainder before the facts are worked
up. Only general statistical con
clusions will be published after the
facts have been tabulated and
studied.
Those who do not wish to use the
schedule published in the Daily
Palo Alto wiil find mimeographed
copies of it in room 20 quad, or at
the Registrar's office.
Please read the following in
structions before filling out the
blank:
Wnere amounts are not asked
for, as under "source of income,"
answers may be given by a check
mark after the proper heading.
Amounts are for the school year
in each year except under "Living
expenses," where they are "per
month."
Investments, as in reference
books, furniture, etc. used during
more than one year should he pro
rated for the year given.
Expenses for bicycles are to be
charged to "Transportation" or to
"Athletics" according as the wheel
is owntd primarily for business
reasons or for recreation.
Use one blank for each year re
ported on, and those who can re
port for more than one year are
earnestly urged to do so, as it is de
sired to learn the difference in ex
penses of the same individual for
different years of the course.
A careful estimate is better than
exact figures taken from an incom
plete or inaccurate note-book.
While complete accuracy is not
possible in most cases and is not!
expected, yet palpably haphazard |
statements are of less than no use
at all.
