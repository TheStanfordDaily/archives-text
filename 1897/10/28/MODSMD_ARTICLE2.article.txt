# Freshmen Line Up.
## 
### 
The Freshman team was lined up
against a combination of Varsity
and second eleven men yesterday
afternoon. The play was hard and
showed a marked improvement in
the condition of the team as a
whole.
Several brilliant plays were
made â€”one, Parker's run from the
kick-off fora touch-down, was one
of the prettiest of the year's work.
For the Freshmen, Wardall, Hill,
and Erb played in good form and
all three can be relitd upon to play
a strong game with Berkeley. Hill

is a corning Varsity man and his
work Saturday will be watched
with great interest. Two or three
changes will probably be made in
tht* team before Saturday and all
will strengthen it. The line is
light but there is a good set of
backs who should do good work,
providing their plays are not
stopped by the breaking through
of the California line.
