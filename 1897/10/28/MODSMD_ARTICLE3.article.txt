# Basket-Ball Captains Elected.

### 
Considerable interest seems to be
taken in basket-ball this year. The
grounds are in good condition and
practice games take place during
most of the regular gymnasium
hours. It has been found possible
this year to organize class teams.
The following were chosen at the
election yesterday as captains: '98,
Miss Parnie Hamilton; '99, Miss
Mayme Merritt; '00, Miss Helen
Shelley;'ol, Miss Winifred Morgan.
These together with Miss Stebbins,
who was chosen business manager,
and Miss Tucker, who was elected
captain of the Varsity basket-ball
team before last year's team disor
ganized, complete the list of officers
for the present year.
