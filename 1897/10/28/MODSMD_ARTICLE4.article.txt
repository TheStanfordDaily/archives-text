# Carnot Preliminaries.
## 
### 
A petition has been circulated
among the Carnot debaters look
ing to the postponement of the
preliminaries until the week follow
ing the Thanksgiving recess. The
petition is signed by sixteen out of
the nineteen debaters and is to come
before the executive committee of
the Inter-Society League tomorrow.
The petitioners urge that the
period preceding Thanksgiving is
primarily one of football excite
ment, and that they can make a
better showing if allowed the extra
time for preparation. The pre
dominance of sentiment seems to be
in favor of postponing the debates.
