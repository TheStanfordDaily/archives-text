# Choral Society.

### 
Those who have the welfare of
the Choral Society at heart have
been greatly encouraged by recent
events. The society at its meeting
last night met with increased mem
bership, owing to the attendance
of new lady singers from Roble
Hall, the campus, and Palo Alto,
and arrangements have been made
whereby the Glee Club will attend.
The society has at last entered
upon a future career in which suc
cess is assured.
