### 
Mention was made last Monday
of the action of the Presbyterian
Synod last Saturday ir recommend
ing a Westminister annex both at
Berkeley and at Stanford. Professor
Griffin, who was in attendance at
the meeting of the synod, said in
an interview that he believed the
plan would be carried through
and that a hall would be built

lon the campus within a year for
students of the Presbyterian faith.
It has ;ilso been decided to inaugu
rate a course of lectures looking to
the culture of Christian life and
the development of the Christian
ministry. These lectures will be
under the direction of a special
committee, and will begin next
semester. They will be delivered
in the chapel, probably Tuesday
evenings.
