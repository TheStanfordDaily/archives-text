# THE 						FRESHMAN GAME
## Fourth Annual Contest Between New Men of California and Stanford. 
### 
Tomorrow will see the fourth an-!
nual game between the freshman I
elevens of California and Stanford, j
California won the tirsi two con
tests played between the two uni
versities* but last year our Fresh
men succeeded in breaking the
monotony and placing the game to
our credit.
The team which goes up this
year is not as good as the one sent j
up last year, while it is generally)
conceded that Berkeley's represen
tatives are stronger this year than
they were last. On the whole Stan
ford's backs outweigh and will
probably outplay California's. The
line men average 15 pounds less
to the man than do their opponents
and will have to work hard to
keep their heavier antagonists
from breaking through and block
ing the play of the backs.
"Jack" Rice, who will not play
tomorrow at San .Jose on account
of injuries, will accompany the
team and act in the capacity of
coach.
In the games with the various
preparatory schools, the California
freshmen have shown up better
than our men have, yet our hopes
have brightened considerably dur
ing the last week and if the "young
'uns" play the game they are capa
ble of playing the score should he
very close.
Following is a brief account of
the individual players who have
been selected to uphold the banner
