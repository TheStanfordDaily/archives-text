The eyes of attendants of even
ing lectures in the chapel are sore
ly afflicted by the two groups of
electric lights on both sides of the
platform. The glare of these lights
as one looks at the speaker is ex
tremely painful and frequent com
plaints of aching heads and eyes
are heard after each lecture. The
lights are not needed there and if
they could be distributed through
the groups in the main part of the
chapel the result would be far more
satisfactory than the present ar
rangement.
