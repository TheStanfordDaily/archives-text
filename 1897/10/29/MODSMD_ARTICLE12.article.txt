The Junior Class met some time
ago and adopted a class hat. Since
that time the committee appointed
to get these hats for members of
the class has been trying in vain
to secure the names of all those de
siring plugs. It was the intention
to send in the order the first of
November, but there are but a few
days remaining before that time
and as yet but a small number of
those in the class have signified
their desire to obtain plugs. If the
class is going to wear a disting
uishing hat at all there is no use
of waiting until the year is almost
gone before coming out in it.
Those who have any intention of
joining their classmates in wearing
the junior plug should hand in
their names at once.
