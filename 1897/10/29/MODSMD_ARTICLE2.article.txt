# Varsity Improves.
## 
### 
The practice yesterday afternoon
was one of the best of the season.
The men played with lots of snap,
and the Varsity's interference was
excellent. Murphy kicked two
field goals and pin ted in fine form.
Daly made some pretty runs
around the right end under strong
interference. One of them netted a
touch-down, but several times he
was downed from behind by Fisher,
who played a fast game on
the second. Jost was in the game
for the first time this season and
showed up well.
The line-up was as follows:
