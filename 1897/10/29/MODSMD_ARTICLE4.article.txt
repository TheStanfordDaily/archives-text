# VARSITY AT SAN JOSE.
## Reliance and Stanford Will Give an Exhibition Game Tomorrow. 
### 
The Varsity will meet the Re-j
lianee team in an exhibition game I
at Cyclers' Park in San Jose tomor
row afternoon. The game will be
closely contested, as both teams are
anxious to win the favor of San
Jose. The sympathies of San Jose
are usually with Stanford, but the
steady game which Reliance will
put up against our weakened
Varsity is sure to win the applause
of the spectators.
The Varsity will be weakened by
the absence of Jeffs at end and Rice
at tackle. Jeffs has water on the
knee, and Rice a severe muscle
bruise, which will put them out of
the game. Fisher was called to
the city today on business and may
not play tomorrow, in which case
his place will he taken by Scoville.
Burnett lias a disabled arm, but
will play. The rest of the team
are in fairly good condition, and
will give a good account of them
selves.
Reliance has telegraphed for
Code, and if he arrives in time for
the game the team will he greatly
strengthened. Wyckoff will then
go to fullback, and with Carter and
Morse for halfbacks, the Reliance
backs will form a strong combina
tion.
The line-up will be:
STANFORD. RELIANCE.
