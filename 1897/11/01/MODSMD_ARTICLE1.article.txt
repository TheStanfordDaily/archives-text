# OUR FRESHMEN WIN.
## Stanford Scores Victory in the First Intercollegiate Contest of the Year. 
### 
For the first live minutes of play
on Saturday it looked as if this
year's Freshman game would he a
repetition of that of two years ago.
Our men played a gr*iat game ex
cepting in the first few minutes,
when they were dazzled no doubt
hy the brilliant appearance of the
opposing team's new sweaters and
awed by the sight of the heavy
rush line which was hilled to go
through our light line like "water
through a tin horn" as Jack Rice
would say. The saying could well
be applied to the manner in which
the line-men played, only Califor
nia represented the horn.
it was a game replete with bril
liant plays and amusing incidents.
The first of these happened when
our men resurrected the old criss
cross. and Wilson plunged through
the line fora good gain. The sec
ond occurred when California tried
.1 long pass. The ball, instead of
falling into the hands of the man
for whom it was intended, was
grabbed by Beckley, who raced
down the field fora touch-down.
At another time the ball was fum
bled and it bounced upon the heads
of the struggling mass of players,
until it seemed as if the teams were
playing under Rugby rules.
California kicked off. There was
a fumble, and our opponents had
the ball. It was soon rushed over
the line, McCabe missing an easy
goal by a narrow margin. The
grandstand, which was tilled with
California sympathizers, in the
ratio of ten to one, went wild think
ing the game would be merely a
procession.
Stanford kicked off to Califor
nia's fifteen-yard line. California
punted for live yards and on, Stan
ford's fumbling kicked twenty
more. The hall remained near the
center of the field until the Stan
ford men by a succession of steady
advances carried it from their own
forty-five-yard line across fora
touch-down. Wilson kicked the
goal, making the score G-4 in our
favor.
The team had by this recovered
confidence and was playing good
ball. Guiberson, the 220-pound
wonder from across the bay, was
being continually put out of the
play by Dole, who weighs but a
trifle over 160 pounds. The center
and tackles were having but little
trouble with their men, while the
backs were playing hard and fast.
California kicked off to Stan
ford's ten-yard line. The ball was
quickly brought to the center of the
field by some pretty end runs.
Play was in California's territory
for the remainder of the half, time
being called with the ball in our
possession on U. C.'s thirty-five
yard line.
Stanford now had the high side
and a little wind. The hall was
brought hack by Kerfoot's pretty
run to the forty-yard line where,
after being unable to gain, Califor
nia punted twenty yards.
Again our Freshmen advanced the
ball without losing it once, over t he
U. C. line and Wilson kicked a
goal, making the score 10-4.

Considerable punting took place
from this stage of the game, and
Burmeister showed his superiority
by placing the ball well down the
lield when called upon to kick.

Beckley made his touch-down and
Premo, not to he outdone by his
Stanford vis-a-vu, took the ball on
a fumble half the length of the
field, scoring four more points
for the blue and gold. No score
was made during the remainder of
the half, the ball resting at the end
in Stanford's possession not twenty
yards from California's goal line.
For California Kerfoot played a
brilliant game at full, making some
tine runs from punts by clever

dodging. Premo and l'ringle also
put up a good game.
Of our men, one might say that
the whole line played a splendid
game against great odds in weight,
while the backs entirely outclassed
the men of the opposing team in
their respective positions. Wardall
was substituted for Captain Manly,
whose injury put him out of the
game after the first touch-down,
and played a dashing game, mak
ing several strong end runs. Wilson
and Burmeister played a hard,
steady game, bucking the line in
great form and running the ball in
on kicks better than has any one
during the whole season.
Beckley played a better game
than Morgan at end, and though
not as fast, he proved a better
ground-gainer and stopped up

of his opportunities. Mill and
Emerson both out-played their

men, making good holes in the line
and tackling well. The three cen
ter men, Maples, Bradley, and
Dole, went under their heavier
opponents and easily kept them
out of the play. "Billy" Erb at
quarter played the best defensive
game on the field. He tackled
hard and low, many times forcing
runners back with loss even when
they had gained. He backed the
line-up in fine st}*le and put up a
great all-around game. The de
eisions of the referee were given in
a decisive manner and the specta
tors were not troubled with any
long waits.
