# HALLOWE'EN KIRMESS.
## The 						Patient Labors of Faculty and Students Result in a Brilliant Festival. 
### 
The Kirmess was a grand suc
cess. The Hildebrand library is
saved.
Aside from the slight hitch
caused by the failure of the lights
at the last moment Friday night,
everything passed off very smoothly.
Those who took part in the various
performances seemed to enjoy it,
the visitors certainly enjoyed it,
and the financial result was in
every way satisfactory.
The main attraction was the
farce. It was given twice during
the evening and once next day.
The room was jammed full each
time and during both performances
at night those who were unfortun
ately left out struggled at the en
trance for standing room within
hearing distance.
It would be presumptuous fora
student paper to attempt to criticise
a faculty farce. The members of
our staff have too many "hours" at
stake to venture upon so foolhardy
a course.
In connection with the farce,
however, one suggestion may be in
order. Heretofore enthusiastic
managers of various enterprises
have gotten up "Said Pasha" per
formances, "She Stoops to Con
quer" shows, lectures —attempts
having even been made to arrange
for faculty football games, to catch
the clinging pennies of the mi
serly student. Thanks to the in
ventive genius of Mr. Nash,we have
now been shown a better way.
Hereafter it will be unnecessary to
levy class assessments to issue
class annuals. Each junior class
can elect an enterprising business
manager and let him arrange fora
farce by members of the faculty.
That will net enough to print the
book. But if Mr. Nash protests
against having his rights infringed
upon, let him follow up this suc
cess by writing another farce in
which President Jordan figures in
a love affair, Dr. Ross as a news
boy on the Bowery, and Dr. Bran
ner as a champion golf-player, and
he will doubtless take in enough to
lay the foundation for Stanford's
new Library building.
While the faculty players were
getting a breath of fresh air, a
vaudeville performance by stu
dents was going on in the same
room in which the farce was given.
The coon quartet gave a medley
of negro songs which was well re
ceived. As is usual on the Pacific
Coast, the blackened faces gave
about the only hint of "darkev
dom." Messrs. Deuel and Strohn
as the "Brothers Hobo" were very
amusing. The spectators could not
get enough of their dancing, but
they had to satisfy themselves with
lliree appearances. Mr. Mcintosh
later in the evening gave them
only one appearance in spile of
hearty encores. Messrs. Riley,
Dillon, and Rosborough each ap
peared on the program and each
attracted his share of the interest
and applause.
In the museum of freaks and ab
normalities there was a contin
uous show. The main attractions
were the auburn-haired fat lady
from Auburn and the mossv
haired mermaid from Searsville
Jake. The fat lady wore her usual
winsome smile and had she been
allowed to use her feminine gift of
speech she would probably have
ensnared the unwary freshman by
talking to him sweetly enough to

beat the German band which was
in attendance.
The girl wonder was very timid
and bashful, but her classical
features and dainty complexion
were a joy to all beholders.
The snake-charmer charmed the
ladies as well as the gentlemen by
her buxom appearance.
Once during the evening the
wild man of Indian Terri
tory escaped and tried to cap
ture some luckless orientals. He
was finally pacified, however, before
doing any damage, by the burly
policeman in attendance.
Near the close of the performance
the dwarf was missed from his post
of duty. A diligent search revealed
his presence in one corner, where
he was diligently engaged selling
pools on the Freshman game.
Mcintosh's wonderful command
of the English language surprised
his closest friends. A freshman

was seen in the Library next day
looking up some of his expressions
in Webster's dictionary.
Irwin's spieling reminded one of
a meeting of the Chicago Board of
Trade.
Everywhere throughout the
building were numerous flower
girls who were determined to let no
guilty man escape. Every one
without a bouquet was told to buy
"ez-vous une boutoniere, Monvieur."
Upstairs Professor Kendtorff
acted as interpreter for the Ger
man waiters in the restaurant.
Professors Griffin and Duniway
alternated as head-waiters.
But, seriously, the Kirmess was
in every way a marked success—a
success socially, artistically, and
financially. To Mrs. Jordan all
praise is due. From the begin
ning the arrangements for the Kir
mess were made in a systematic
manner and the thorough organ
ization which made the whole af-

fair move along without a hitch
was a delight to all who admire a
large and well-poised faculty for
organization in man or woman.
The net proceeds of the Kirmess
were about one thousand dollars.
