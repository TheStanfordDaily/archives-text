# HALLOWE'EN KIRMESS.
## The
						Patient Labors of Faculty and Students Result in a Brilliant Festival. 
### 
The Kirmess was a grand suc
cess. The Hildebrand library is
saved.
Aside from the slight hitch
caused by the failure of the lights
at the last moment Friday night,
everything passed off very smoothly.
Those who took part in the various
performances seemed to enjoy it,
the visitors certainly enjoyed it,
and the financial result was in
every way satisfactory.
The main attraction was the
farce. It was given twice during
the evening and once next day.
The room was jammed full each
time and during both performances
at night those who were unfortun
ately left out struggled at the en
trance for standing room within
hearing distance.
It would be presumptuous fora
student paper to attempt to criticise
a faculty farce. The members of
our staff have too many "hours" at
stake to venture upon so foolhardy
a course.
In connection with the farce,
however, one suggestion may be in
order. Heretofore enthusiastic
managers of various enterprises
have gotten up "Said Pasha" per
formances, "She Stoops to Con
quer" shows, lectures â€”attempts
having even been made to arrange
for faculty football games, to catch
the clinging pennies of the mi
serly student. Thanks to the in
ventive genius of Mr. Nash,we have
now been shown a better way.
Hereafter it will be unnecessary to
levy class assessments to issue
class annuals. Each junior class
can elect an enterprising business
manager and let him arrange fora
farce by members of the faculty.
That will net enough to print the
book. But if Mr. Nash protests
against having his rights infringed
upon, let him follow up this suc
cess by writing another farce in
which President Jordan figures in
a love affair, Dr. Ross as a news
boy on the Bowery, and Dr. Bran
ner as a champion golf-player, and
he will doubtless take in enough to
lay the foundation for Stanford's
new Library building.
While the faculty players were
getting a breath of fresh air, a
vaudeville performance by stu
dents was going on in the same
room in which the farce was given.
The coon quartet gave a medley
of negro songs which was well re
ceived. As is usual on the Pacific
Coast, the blackened faces gave
about the only hint of "darkev
dom." Messrs. Deuel and Strohn
as the "Brothers Hobo" were very
amusing. The spectators could not
get enough of their dancing, but
they had to satisfy themselves with
lliree appearances. Mr. Mcintosh
later in the evening gave them
only one appearance in spile of
hearty encores. Messrs. Riley,
Dillon, and Rosborough each ap
peared on the program and each
attracted his share of the interest
and applause.
In the museum of freaks and ab
normalities there was a contin
uous show. The main attractions
