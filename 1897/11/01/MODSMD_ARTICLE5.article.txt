It is not within the province of
this paper to dictate to the other
officers of the student body what
they shall do. and we have no dis
position to interfere with their af
fairs so long as they are conducted
in the open. But when there is a
gross violation of the student body
constitution or a deliberate usurpa
tion of power, we believe that the
paper owes it to the student body
whose representative it is'to speak
out and call attention to the course
affairs are taking.
All the managers of our various
teams are subject to the same rules
in the student body constitution.
If these rules are too stringent on
any one manager they should be
changed, but not ignored.
In regard to the expenditure of
the funds of the Associated .Stu
dents, the following paragraph has
been put in our student body con
stitution :
''The Treasurer shall collect and
have charge of the funds of the as
sociation, and shall disburse the
same upon the joint recommenda
tion of the President of the associa
tion, the manager of the enterprise
concerned, and himself. (It is to
be understood that the Treasurer
disburse all funds directly, thus
relieving the managers of the neces
sity of handling funds.) lie shall
have the power to appoint assistant
collectors."
We understand that the con
tract has been let for printing this
year's football souvenir. May we
ask by what authority? The ser
vices of two football trainers have
been secured. Were the proper
persons consulted in regard to this
expense? In the expenditure of
the student body funds for foot
ball supplies, has fifty dollars cov

ered the expenses up to this time?
These are some of tlie things mem
bers of our student body want to
know. And they have a right to
know.
