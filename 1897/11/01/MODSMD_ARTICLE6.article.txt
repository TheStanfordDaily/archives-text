# AGAIN VICTORIOUS.
## The Cardinal Triumphs a Third Time Over the Maroon and White.
### 
The Varsity on Saturday for the
third time placed the cardinal
above the maroon and white of
Reliance. The game was interest
ing after the teams commenced to
ginger up, and the people of San
Jose were well pleased with the
exhibition, especially when it is
considered that Saturday's game
was the first good game of football
that San Jose has seen for years.
The attendance was about six
hundml.
The game in the first half was
discouraging for Stanford, Reliance
scoring the six points which stood
to the credit of the maroon at the
end of the game in the first fifteen
minutes. After the kick-off and
an exchange of kicks, in which
Wyckoff fumbled the ball to Barker,
the Varsity started to buck the
line, Fisher for two yards and
Carle the same number. The hall
was then lost on downs. On the
first play of Reliance, an end run
by Carter, Fickert broke through
the line and threw the runner back
with a loss of five yards. Reliance
kicked and a kicking duel between
Wyckoff and Murphy resulted in a
gain for Stanford of at least ten
yards. Reliance then changed
tactics and started to buck the line,
Frick, Carter, and Arlett all mak
ing gains. The Stanford line
stiffened up in vain, and Carter
finally carried the ball over the line
fora touch-down which Wyckoff
converted into a goal.
Carle kicked off and the re
mainder of the half was marked
by Murphy's good kicking, which
kept the goal out of danger. The
only serious feature was tiie block
ing of one of Murphy's kicks by
Frick. The score stood at the end
6-0.
Carle kicked off for twenty yards
in the second half and Carter
bucked through tackle for four
yards. Frick tried left end for no
gain. Wyckoff kicked for thirty
yards and Daly ran it in live
yards. Murphy kicked for thirty.
Reliance tried both tackles for no
gain. Failing at line-bucking Re
liance tried kicking again, Wyckoff
making a thirty-yard punt which
Murphy ran in ten yards. Murphy
made a tine punt but the ball was
brought back and given to Reliance
on off-side plav. Carter ran around
right end for three yards, and after
a buck without gain Wyckoff
kicked for thirty-five yards.
Murphy caught it and quick as a
flash he was off for twenty yards
before being tackled. Carle fol
lowed this with a thirty-yard run
around the left end. Murphy failed
at drop-kick and Reliance got the
bali on the twenty-five-yard line.
Wyckoff soon kicked, and it was
then that Murphy made his great
run of forty yards, dodg
ing right and left through
the scattered field. The ball
was soon on Reliance's ten-yard
line, and Cotton and Daly made
gains. The ball was then given to
Fisher, who plunged through
Sheehy fora touch-down, and Mur
phy kicked the goal. Score 6-6.
Reliance kicked off, and Cotton
ran it in ten yard*. Murphy
kicked forty. Reliance failed to
gain. Wyckoff and Murphy ex
changed punts, Stanford gaining.
On a fumble Burnett secured the
ball. Daly then made a fine run of
twenty-live yards fora touch-down.
Murphy kicked the goal. Score
12-6."
In the remainder of the play the j
ball was kept well in Reliance's,
territory. Fickert made one great'

run of thirty yards breaking
through the line. The final score
