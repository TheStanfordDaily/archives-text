# MUSICIANS IN SAN JOSE.
## Glee and Mandolin Clubs Give a Successful Concert in the Garden City 
### 
The concert given by the Glee
and Mandolin Clubs in San Jose
Saturday evening was a success
both musically and socially. Ger
mania Hall was comfortably tilled
with an appreciative audience, and
the clubs were given every incen
tive to do their best. After the
concert was over an informal dance
was held for about an hour.
The clubs drove to San Jose in
two large buses, and arrived there
in time for the game, where they
rooted and advertised the concert.
The winning of the game gave the
clubs an excellent opening wedge
in San Jose, and the conceit ben
efited thereby. The opening selec
tion by the Glee Club, "Dear Old
Stanford,'' was met with great ap
plause, as was also Mr. Riley's ref
erence in his monologue, "The
Funny Man with the Funny
Story," to the 12-6 score.
Both clubs this year seem to be
up to the standards of past years,
and in some respects have improved.
In the Glee Club the tenors seem
to be stronger than last. Several
of the members singing the bass
parts come out too strong at times
and often indicate lack of control
over their voices. Otherwise the
men sang well together and mer
ited the hearty applause received.
The Mandolin Club played with
precision and every selection was
enjoyed. The leader, Mr. Sewm 11,
was missed at first mandolin, but
the work of the club was on the
whole praiseworthy. Mr. Riley
was at his beat and kept the audi
ence in good humor. 11 is selec
tions were good and they made a
decided hit. Mr. Rosborough's
imitations and specialties were very
amusing, although bis encores were
not so happily chosen.
The regular program was as fol
lows, but it was in reality twice as
long, as almost every selection re
ceived an encore:
