# Berkeley Notes.
## 
### 
—The executive committee at U.
C. bus done away with the usual
competition for prize football songs
and has substituted a competition
for yells.
—The editors of Blue and Hold
have been warned against inserting
matter in the publication overstep
ping the bounds of propriety or
unduly ridiculing those in author
ity.
—If no opposition arises from
the faculty, the U. C. team, with a
strong scrub eleven, will hie away
to some quiet country nook for
secret practice, for two weeks prior
to the Thanksgiving game.
—The following men are on the
U. C. training table: Barnes,
Bender, Craig, Edwards, Griesberg,
Guiberson, Hall, Haskell, Hopper,
Kaarsburg, McDermott, Pringle,
SSpence, Thane, Meyer, Simpson,
and Fowler.
—Berkeley students are racking
their brains to devise new yells for
this year's game. Our "Give 'em
the axe" yell of last year was so
effectual that thev have decided
they must have some slogan equally
as good at the corning contest.
