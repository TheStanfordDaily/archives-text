# Does Business Regularity Pay?

The following editorial appeared
in last Friday's Occident, the weekly
paper published at the University
of California:
"The troubles before the Field
day last year should have taught
the necessity of clearness in inter
collegiate agreements, of good faith
in negotiation, or, at least, some
degree of business regularity. Our

cardinal friends have not yet under
stood this and still make use of a
certain puerile machiavelisni which
is as harmful to true collegian
sports as it is childish.
"There met, a few months ago,
representatives from both universi
ties in order to revise or supple
rnent the existing intercollegiate
agreement. After full discussion,
the secretary of this committee
drew up the revised agreement.
Tiiis, after ratification by our execu
tive committee, was sent to Stan
ford for the same purpose. After a
long silence, notice came from Palo
Alto that itwas —lust. The wearied,
disillusioned agreement has fled
from this world of wrangles and
bickerings to more peaceful and
happy climes —to the heaven of lost,
strayed, or stolen. The Stanford
representatives bewailed this loss
properly and in a paroxysm of re
pentance and good-will, in frenzied
haste to atone for their negligence,
drew up another agreement and
sent it to us for ratification.
"Observe the slight difference.
The tirst agreement had been
drawn up by representatives of
both universities; the second, by the
Stanford representatives alone.
"Hut, alas! the distrust and cal
lousness of this world! Cardinal
ingeniousness and candor proved of
no avail against Blue and Gold
raandarinhm. The executive com
mittee of the University of Califor
nia refused to ratify the new agree
ment. And the old intercollegiate
treaty must serve, or the whole
proceeding be begun over again.
"Which may teach that, in this
gross and material world, business
regularity has its advantages.''
