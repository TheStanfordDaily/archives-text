# Varsity Practices Signals
## 
### 
Owing to the two match games
of last Saturday there were not
men enough on the field last night
to form two teams. Murphy was
not out in his suit and P. Smith
played quarter on the Varsity,
which practiced signals and tried a
couple of new plays from the
guards-back formation. Ilea Smith,!
who was compelled to stop playing
some weeks ago on account of the
interference of his parents, was out
again and played in his old posi
tion on the end.
The grandstand was well filled
and a small part of the spectators
under the leadership of "Bill"
Irwin, '98, made things lively, and
as one of the players said, "made
the men feel as though Thanks
giving day was drawing near." It
is to be hoped that last night's
enthusiasm is merely the beginning,
and that we shall soon see the same
old spirit which always pervades ]
the atmosphere for the few weeks
just preceding the big game.
