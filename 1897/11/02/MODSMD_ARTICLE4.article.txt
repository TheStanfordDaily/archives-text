The November Atlantic has a re
view by Mr. Mabie of Lord Hal lam
Tennyson's life of his father. The
book will contain a number of
Tennyson's unpublished poems.
"Democracy and the Laboring
Man" is a study of the last ten
years' legislation in favor of labor.
The courts are not hostile to labor,
though they have been obliged to
declare unconstitutional half the
measures proposed by legislatures
playing politics.

"Peculiarities of American Mu
nicipal Government" is a paper on
the development of "bossistn," the
tendency to centralization in city
authority, and the influence on leg
islative functions of rural senti
ment.
John Fiske ridicules the theory
that Francis Bacon wrote Shak
spere's plays, and cites many amus
ing developments of the theory.
Perhaps the most interesting art
icle is "The Coming LMerary Re
vival," since by a, consideration of
the signs and exigencies of the
times it inspires the belief that a
stirring literary period is about to
begin and that we may take part
in it.
