## Answer of Treasurer and Football Manager to this Paper's Editorial. 
### 
The following communication was ,
received at this office this afternoon j
in reply to an editorial in Mon-j
day's paper.
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In Monday's issue there ap-1
peared an editorial of some length !
concerning the actions of "officers
of the student body." In almost
undisguised language the treasurer
and football manager are discussed.
We realize that it is best, as a rule,
to remain silent before newspaper
accusations; but we are also alive
to the fact that silence here may be j
accepted by some as a bowing of,
the head in conscious guilt.
We shall go somewhat into de
tail, that the true relations of presi
dent, manager, and treasurer as
they have existed in the past and
as they are authorized by a correct
interpretation of the constitution,
maybe understood by the entire
student body; and incidentally to
show that we have not in a single
act violated the constitution.
In the editorial above referred to
you speak of "a deliberate usur
pation of powei' and hint at affairs
not "conducted in the open." We
claim that affairs have been "eon
ducted in the open," and we deny
that there has been on our part
any "usurpation of power." ll
there has been it is our right to
have tiie proof of it. To base suÂ« h
allegations upon dicta alone, is. to
say the least, an unsafe procedure.
In that editorial a section of our
constitution is quoted, and we give
in full your quotation:
"The Treasurer shall collect and
have charge of the funds of the as
sociation, and shall disburse the
same upon the joint recommenda
tion of the President of the asso
ciation, the manager of the enter
prise concerned, and himself. (It
is to lie understood that the Treas
urer disburse all funds directly,
thus relieving the managers of the
necessity of handling funds.)"
Upon that section you seem to rest
your case. But let us see how that
section has been interpreted.
In letting the contrrct for the
souvenir was there a "deliberate
usurpation of power" or was it not
"done in the open"? Our very
system of offices lodges these semi
ministerial acts in the treasurer
and manager. They must neces
sarily know better than the presi
dent jr.st what is needed, and all
the latter need do is to keep him
self informed of the amounts ex
pended. If he fail to do this he
and not the treasurer nor manager
is neglecting his duty. It is his
business to know what is going on,
and not sit silently by and then
ask why he was not consulted.
Moreover, in this particular in
stance of the souvenir the Execu
tive Committee presided over by
the president of the student body
was informed by the treasurer of
his intentions in regard to the
souvenir. If the president had an
objection to make why did he not
present it? He chose to remain
silent, and a treasurer would be a
remarkable man indeed if he con-

Btrr.ed such silence as anything
less than acquiescence.
You ask by what authority the
two football trainers were secured. I
We answer that this is an act j
always conceded to he a part oft
the duty of the manager and treas- !
urer. Time, custom, experience!
has so ordained it. The "recom
mendation of the President" men
tioned by the constitution means
his general supervision and care
and not his express consent on
every matter great or small. If he I
cares to ask about all matters very
well, we shall do our best to inform
him. Every student bod}' presi
dent, treasurer, and manager under
the new constitution has taken
this view of it; the Executive Com
mittee has upheld them, and the j
student body in turn has supported
the committee. To deny this is
to show ignorance" of the constitu
tion; to assail it is to quibble.
In the accusation, namely,
that more than $50 has been, ex
pended for football goods, is dis
played an ignorance of the consti
tution almost lamentable. We had
supposed that everyone understood
that fifty-dollar clause to refer to
expenditures made by the manager
alone; not for football goods, not
fora coach, not fora football field.
The treasurer and manager with
the approval of the president do
those things, nnd the treasurer takes
vouchers for them. The manager
is allowed to expend $o0 when the
treasurer can not be reached. It
becomes necessary for the manager
to buy medicine fora football !
player while in the city. The
treasurer may not be at hand, the
medicine must be paid for, the
manager pays it.and vouches to
the treasurer who in turn vouches
to the Executive Committee. For
just such emergency expenses as
these is the $50 allowance made to
the manager.
It must therefore be clear that
this last accusation was made out
of abundant misunderstanding of
the constitution.
In every instance where a new
problem lias arisen we have con
sulted the president. He was con
sulted when the coach was engaged;
his advice sought whenever possible
in regard to the new grounds in
the city; a student body meeting
was requested to decide upon a lo
cation for the new football field;
the consent of the Executive Com
mittee to build the new grandstand
was obtained; and even members of
i the faculty athletic committee were
consulted on every proposition.
Does this seem like "deliberate
usurpation of power"? Does it
savor of affairs "not conducted in
the open"? In fact we have pre
sented every new problem to the
president as it arose. We are glad
to have his advice. We shall seek
it in the future as in the past on
matters not connected with our
daily routine work, and welcome it
on all occasions. We do not court
responsibility to the extent of ignor
ing the president.
We reiterate what we said in the
beginning: We have not ignored
the constitution, and we challenge
anyone to prove that we have. We
therefore humbly submit that af
fairs have been conducted in the

"open" and that there has been no
"deliberate usurpation of power."
Respectfully,
John M. Switzer,
Horace Pomeroy "
