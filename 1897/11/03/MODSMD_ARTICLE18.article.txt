The November Arena opens with
a paper by the Governor of Wash
ington, "Freedom and. Its Oppor
tunities." He claims that the
right to live, to labor, and to hold
land, can not be taken away from
man with impunity, and that the
day when nature will rebel is at
hand.
Judge George H. Smith reviews
Mr. Giffen's work, "The Case
against Bimetallism." The case s
clearly stated, and Mr. Giffen's ar
guments are ably answered.
"The Initiative and the Referen
dum" advocates a system when b
the voters at large may suggest
laws which they de.-ire, and
whereby every bill framed by
hitures shall be referred to the
voters to be ratified or veti ed.
There are three papers on "The
Laborer's View of the Labor Ques
tion" written by ni<m who speak
from their own experience. ''llow
the Laborer Feels" is moderate and
patient in tone. The question
whether the workingmen's condi
tion is going "Up or Down" is de
cided as emphatically down. The
trials of the"The Farm Hand" are
brought to notice for the first time.
The author of "The Demand for
Sensational .Journals" holds that
the public buys them because they
are forced upon it and not because
it especially desires them.
The editor has a paper on the
question "is History a Science?" in
which after a discussion of the
difficulties it presents to scientific
treatment, he concludes with the
belief that the human mind will in
the end make it the most beautiful
and sublime department of human
knowledge.
