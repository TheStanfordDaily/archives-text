# On the Football Field.

### 
Two good teams lined up against
each other yesterday afternoon.
The personnel of the elevens was
considerably changed during the
practice and many men were given
an opportunity to play owing to
slight accidents which happened to
several of the men.
Three of the Freshmen played
on the second, Beckley at end,
Wardall and Hill as halves. All
three put up a good game; Wardall
especially showing his excellence
in running with the ball. Daly
made some fine runs around the
right end with guard interference,
and Cotton showed old-time energy
in running with the ball. Jeffs
was placed at quarter on the Var
sity and passed very well indeed
considering his unfainiliarity with
the position. He also madeseveral
pretty runs-in after kicks.
Two touch-downs were made by
the Varsity, Daly going around
the end and down half the length
of the iield for one, and Carle mak
ing the other on a straight buck
with guards back.
The enthusiasm of the grand
stand has not diminished and the
Stanford yell is beginning to be
known about the field.
The line-up was as follows:
