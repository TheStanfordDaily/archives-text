We hope that all our readers
who are members of the student
body pard careful attention to the
communication in last night's pa
per from the treasurer and foot
ball manager of the Associated
Students. If there are any whcj>
liave not yet done so, we ask them
now in justice to those two gentle
men to read what is there set forth.
We feel that the question
at issue in this dispute is
CXOj J ■
one of more than passing nn J
portance. We have no desire to
impugn the motives of the persons
whose actions we have called in
question*. But we believe that a
thirst for power or an impatience
under restraint has led them to
overstep the rules which have been
laid down for the government of
these particular olficers in the stu
dent body. And we agree thor
oughly with a well-known profes
sor who said in discussing the ed
itorial to which reply has just been
made, that "the student body con
stitution should be enforced when
good men are in power so that dis
honest men will not seek refuge be
hind a bulwark of precedents when
asked to conform to the rules."
Yes, we dare re-assert that there
has been usurpation of power. And
we realize perfectly that, as our
friends say, "to base such allega
tions upon dicta alone, is, to say
the least, an unsafe procedure."
They may rest assured that it is
not part of the policy of this paper
to make assertions before the
grounds for them are thoroughly
investigated.
In ii matter of this kind all ef-
PO fpfi .1 ' "fic.t:/.
forts to. appeal to sympathy are
out of place. We repeat that
this can not be considered a ques
tion of persons. The strenuous ef
fort to drag the president' of the
student body into the matter and
the insinuations in connection with
that attempt co.uld not he inter
preted otherwise-than as an' insult
to the editor of this paper and a
reflection upon his independence,
were not the purpose for which it
was done so easily recognized. It
is probably true that the president
has been ignored, but the Execu
tive Committee has been ignored
also, and that is more to the point.
The space at our disposal toda}'
will not permit of an extended dis
cussion of each of the three points
in yesterday's communication. We
shall have to content ourselves for

the present with a discussion of
the first one on which a defense is
made. In our editorial it was said:
"We understand that the contract
lias been let for printing this year's
football souvenir. May we ask by
what authority?" In reply to that
question we were told that "the
Executive Committee presided over
by the president of the student
body was informed by the treas
urer of his intentions in regard to
the souvenir."
On this point we have the testi
mony of every member of the Ex
ecutive Committee it has been pos
sible to see, and every single one of
them denies that the Executive
Committee was ever "informed by
the treasurer of his intentions" un
til after his intentions had been
put into execution and the con
tract had been let. There is noth
ing \n the minutes to show that
the matter was ever brought before
the committee. And more than
that, at the regular monthly meet
ing of the Executive Committee
last night, at which seven oul of
nine of the members were present,
the committee put itself on record
by a unanimous vote denying that
its consent had ever been obtained
for this particular contract. The
denial is printed in full on the lirst
page t0day..,,,. „
Here is a specific case where the
Executive Committee has full con
trol both by the constitution and
by precedent. Last year the treas
urer received explicit directions
from the Executive Committee in
making .arrangements for the sou
venir, and was required to render
to the committee a full account of
all his acts as the work on the book
progressed, as well as a full report
of the finances when all the re
cei | ts were in and all the bills were
pai<l.
What can this lie called but a
usurpation of power? There was
no emergency in connection with
the letting of this contract and no
"to-buy-medicine" excuse can be
brought forward to defend it.
With every change in the per
sonnel of the Executive Committee
there has been an attempt, made to
wrench part of ite power from it be
fore the new members were suffi
.
ciently acquainted with their du
ties to know just what was taking
place. Each new committee has
had to assert its rights, and in
every case when the student body
has been appealed to it has decided
that it would rather have all stu
dent body matters brought before
this committee of nine representa
tives which is held directly respon
sible and whose action can be
speedily reversed if necessary, than
to concentrate power in the hands
of other student body officers who
assume a defiant attitude and are
responsible to no one in particular.
