There were no touch-downs made
by either side yesterday. The
second team seemed quite capable
of not only holding its own but of
forcing the Varsity to put up a
lively defense in order not to he
scored against. On both sides the
guards were played behind the
line and but few runs were made.
Daly succeeded twice in dashing
around the end for gains of twenty
yards, and Scoville, of the secord,
made some good runs for his team.
diet Thomas and Rusk both
played an improved game at tackle,
while Jeffs' work at quarter shows
that there need be no fear that the
position will not be well filled in
the event that Murphy has to be
substituted.
Fickert punted for the Varsity,
Scoville doing the same for the
second. For the second team
Huston and Dole did good work.
Dole succeeded in getting through
the interference and making some
good tackles.
The line-up was as follows:
VARSITY. SECOND.
Leavitt 1 end r Dole
Rice 1 tackle r llusk
Fickert 1 guard r.Ballantyne
Burnett center Biglow
