# ANOTHER APPEAL.
## Officers Are Very, Very Sorry That the Executive Committee Has a Grievance. 
### 
The following communication
was handed in at this office this
afternoon somewhat later than
articles of fiuch length are usually
accepted for publication. By keep
ing the printers overtime and
crowding out other matter we are
enabled to give it to our readers
tonight:
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
We are loath to drag out this
discussion; we much prefer to meet
the Executive Committee face to
face, and explain our position to
them. However, if this were a
matter of newspaper comment last
Monday, it is none the less so now.
That editorial may have been
written in the kindliest spirit to
remind us we were trespassing, and
yet be misunderstood by the pub
lic. The president was doubtless
unaware of its publication, but
that certainly did not abridge our
right to use his name in explaining
our conduct.
In last night's editorial 110 effort
is made to prove that the president
has been ignored. We respectfully
submit that he has not, but you
devote some space attempting to
prove that the Executive Com
mittee has been ignored and assert
with some force that the committee
knew nothing about the souvenir
until after the contract was let. In
1894 the treasurer alone and unau
thorized, either by the president or
Executive Committee, let the con
tract for the souvenir. In 1895 the
manager equally unauthorized let
the contract. In 1896 the manager
being in some doubt as to his
authority in the matter, asked the
president to refer it to the Execu
tive Committee for determination.
They decided that it was a part of
the treasurer's duty. This accounts
for the minutes of the Executive
Committee to which you refer.
This year the treasurer having pre
sided over this committee, and be
ing aware of its action in regard to
the souvenir last year, proceeded to
let the contract. However, before
that instrument was signed the
committee was informed that the
treasurer had let it to the lowest
bidder, the contract price being
.$95 less than last year. If.the com
mittee had complained of a "usur
pation of power" then the contract
would not have been signed. They
did not object, and the contract was
signed some days later. In the
face of this can you consistently
say it was a "thirst for power"
that impelled the treasurer to do
an act which the Executive Com
mittee the year before determined
was a part of his duties? It is
strange to suppose that he should
ask consent he already had. As to
a "full account of his acts," that is
required every month under an ex
pressed provision of the constitu
tion, and any requirement of the
Executive Committee in addition
thereto would be mere surplusage;
and further there is nothing up-to
date to report, for no expenditures
have been made or receipts taken
in, in connection with the souvenir;
as soon as there have been we

stand ready to inform the com
mittee.
In regard to the souvenir you
say, "Here is a specific case where
the Executive Committee has full
control both by the constitution
and by precedent." We challenge
this statement. There is not in
any part of the constitution, in the
by-laws, nor amendments, a single
line, a single word, giving author
ity to their committee to act with
thejrnanager or treasurer in doing
such an act as hiring a trainer or
letting a contract fora souvenir.
The president is given this power,
but not the committee, and in our
last communication we showed
how presidents have ordinarily ex
ercised that power. You did not
dispute the correctness of that
statement more than to say it was
''probably true the president had
been ignored." If the Executive
Committee has ever excercised any
of these functions, it has done so
through a more liberal interpreta
tion of the constitution than was
ever intended. It is building up a
"bulwark of precedents" behind
which dishonest members might
retreat. A constitution is no bet
ter than those who carry it into ef
fect, whether they be managers,
treasurers, or members of the com
mittee. The indisputable truth is,
the Executive Committee has
'"thirsted for power" and accumu
lated it from year to year, almost
in defiance of the constitution, and
certainly by not such a strict con
struction as you now desire to force
upon us. But never before has an
Executive Committee reached over
and claimed the right to approve of
the hiring of a football trainer, be
fore the manager could engage him.
If such an act as this be a part of
that committee's duties, every act
which involves the expenditure of
any sum in any manner and for
any purpose whatsoever must first
be approved by them. There is
no escape from this conclusion.
The principle is the same, and the
logical absurdity of it must be evi
dent to all. In this we mean no
disrespect whatsoever to the per
sonnel of the Executive Committee
nor to any officer of the student
body, and have only discussed that
committee and the constitution
that our position may be made
clearer.
As to the resolution of the Ex
ecutive Committee published in
last night's issue we shall say this:
We never claimed to have gained
the express consent of the Execu
tive Committee, for as stated in our
previous communication and above,
we do not deem it necessary and
we see 110 reason to recede from
that position.
With Thanksgiving only a few
days from us we can not in justice j
to the many duties devolving upon j
us give more time to newspaper
controversy. We have stated our,
case and we stand by it. But |
whatever difference there may be
with the president or with the Ex
ecutive Committee we shall settle
that with them directly, as should j
have been in the beginning. Be
fore we were aware from any source
whatsoever that the president or j
the Executive Committee had what j
they thought to be a grievance 1

j against our actions your editorial
j columns were turned loose against
us. Not until laÂ«t night's issue of
: your paper were we informed that
j the Executive Committee claimed
to have a grievance. Since the con
} trovery arose we have not met face
Ito face our Executive Committee.
Moreover the entire controversy
is quibbling over matters which
: have never before borne disputes.
Jin ever}' instance we aimed
jto and did follow an un
| assailed precedent. Who, for
the past two years accused the
treasurers and managers of "usur
pation of power"? If the
precedents which we have fol
lowed are bad we shall be
the last to insist 011 following
them. Let the Executive Com
mittee declare them unsafe and the
controversy ends. We have not
and do not "assume a defiant atti
tude." We object, however, to
accusations of "usurpation of
power" or of not "acting in the
open" on account of doing only
that for which men in the past
have been upheld

been ignored." If the Executive
Committee has ever excercised any
of these functions, it has done so
through a more liberal interpreta
tion of the constitution than was
ever intended. It is building up a
"bulwark of precedents" behind
which dishonest members might
retreat. A constitution is no bet
ter than those who carry it into ef
fect, whether they be managers,
treasurers, or members of the com
mittee. The indisputable truth is,
the Executive Committee has
'"thirsted for power" and accumu
lated it from year to year, almost
in defiance of the constitution, and
certainly by not such a strict con
struction as you now desire to force
upon us. But never before has an
Executive Committee reached over
and claimed the right to approve of
the hiring of a football trainer, be
fore the manager could engage him.
If such an act as this be a part of
that committee's duties, every act
which involves the expenditure of
any sum in any manner and for
any purpose whatsoever must first
be approved by them. There is
no escape from this conclusion.
The principle is the same, and the
logical absurdity of it must be evi
dent to all. In this we mean no
disrespect whatsoever to the per
sonnel of the Executive Committee
nor to any officer of the student
body, and have only discussed that
committee and the constitution
that our position may be made
clearer.
As to the resolution of the Ex
ecutive Committee published in
last night's issue we shall say this:
We never claimed to have gained
the express consent of the Execu
tive Committee, for as stated in our
previous communication and above,
we do not deem it necessary and
we see 110 reason to recede from
that position.
With Thanksgiving only a few
days from us we can not in justice j
to the many duties devolving upon j
us give more time to newspaper
controversy. We have stated our,
case and we stand by it. But |
whatever difference there may be
with the president or with the Ex
ecutive Committee we shall settle
that with them directly, as should j
have been in the beginning. Be
fore we were aware from any source
whatsoever that the president or j
the Executive Committee had what j
they thought to be a grievance 1

j against our actions your editorial
j columns were turned loose against
us. Not until laÂ«t night's issue of
: your paper were we informed that
j the Executive Committee claimed
to have a grievance. Since the con
} trovery arose we have not met face
Ito face our Executive Committee.
Moreover the entire controversy
is quibbling over matters which
: have never before borne disputes.
Jin ever}' instance we aimed
jto and did follow an un
| assailed precedent. Who, for
the past two years accused the
treasurers and managers of "usur
pation of power"? If the
precedents which we have fol
lowed are bad we shall be
the last to insist 011 following
them. Let the Executive Com
mittee declare them unsafe and the
controversy ends. We have not
and do not "assume a defiant atti
tude." We object, however, to
accusations of "usurpation of
power" or of not "acting in the
open" on account of doing only
that for which men in the past
have been upheld
