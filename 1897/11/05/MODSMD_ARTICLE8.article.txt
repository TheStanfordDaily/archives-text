Tomorrow night in room 10 quad
some novel plans will be discussed
for the new debating society that
is to be formed then. All young
men interested in debate and who
are not already enrolled as mem
bers of their societies, should take
advantage of this opportunity to
be present and perhaps become
charter members of the new club.
Although there already exist some
live debating societies at Stanford,
there are many students who are
not getting the practice that they
want; only four can debate each
week in a single club, and for this
reason small societies and many of
them are desirable. Mr. MacKin
non, president of Euphronia, will
preside at the opening of the meet
ing. We heartily wish the new so
ciety all success.
