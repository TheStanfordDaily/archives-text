# SATURDAY'S GAME A TIE.
## California Escapes Defeat at the Hands of Reliance by a Narrow Margin 
### 
Saturday's game between Re
liance and California resulted in a
tie. The score, four to four, was
the same as that made in their
game two weeks before.
The western half of the field was
comparatively dry, hut the eastern
portion was in miserable condition,
water standing in puddles all over
the lield. A major portion of the
playing was done on the lower side
and as a result the different players,
as well as the ball, soon became
very slippery. Oftentimes the run
ner would be downed in a puddle
with a spattering of mud and slush
and the players would find it nec
essary to scrape each other off now
and t hen in order to be able to see.
The line-up of the Berkeley team
was materially different from that
of the preceding game. Greisberg
replaced Kaarsburg at full and
Ludlow came from tackle to play
the right half. Haskell was at
quarter and Hopper on theleftend,
while Pringle, the freshman tackle,
filled Ludlow's recent place in the
line. Simpson, of last year's var
sity, was played for the first time
this season and succeeded in keep
ing Sheehy guessing.
By means of all these changes
the strength of the California line
has been kept intact, while behind
the line there is considerable im
provement. It is true that at pres
ent none of the backs are good
punters, hut Captain Hall may suc
ceed during the remaining few
weeks in developing his ability in
that line in a very marked de
gree.
The Reliance men were also
changed around considerably.,
Morse, llobbs, and Wells were not |
in the game. Frick, although rele
gated to the side-lines, played a
prominent part and succeeded in
upholding his reputation as the
champion long-winded kicker of the
Coast. Code was hack in his old
place at quarter and very mater
ially strengthened the team by his
cool-headed and steady plaj\
Wyckoff kicked off for Reliance;
California ran it in twenty yards'
and by heavy rushes carried it to i
the center of the lield where the
ball went to Reliance. Carter
made eight yards and Wyckoff
punted, the ball rolling in touch!
and being brought out to the
twenty-five-yard line fora freei
kick. The ball came no nearer!
than U. (J.'s ten-yard line until |
Carter, catching the pig-skin on hisj
own forty-yard-line, ran the whole
length of the lield and made the I
only touch-down for his team. No
goal was kicked. Honors were
about even for the remainder of the
half, both Carter and Hall making
good runs. Time was called forj
the half with the ball on Reliance's
thirty-yard line.
In the second half the Califor
nia. backs worked like Trojans and
succeeded in placing the ball over
the line. The goal, which was a 1
difficult one, was missed.
Berkeley kicked off and Reliance
soon got the ball, which they car
ried to within one foot of the Cal
ifornia goal and were just prepar

ing to shove it over, when the ref
eree's whistle announced that the
game was over and that Reliance
again had narrowly missed victory.
Carter and Hall gave an exhibi
tion of some of the prettiest end
running which has yet been seen.
Wyckoff punted from the halfback
position and it was surprising how
few of his kicks were blocked.
Hall made some pretty catches of
punts while on the dead run and if
the field is fust on Thanksgiving
day he can be expected to do some
clever work of that kind.
