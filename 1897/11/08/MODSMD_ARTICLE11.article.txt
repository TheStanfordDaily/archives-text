Tllk Daily Palo Alto would
have nothing more to say in the
controversy between it and the
student body management but for
the fact that although every point
upon which the paper insisted in
tlie first place has been yielded in
its favor, a whole train of insinua
tions and misleading statements
has been left behind. These would
very likely be accepted by many
persons as the truth if left un
answered.
We believe that every fair-minded
person will admit that if the treas
urer and football manager had any
arguments in their favor which
would hang together they should
have used them in defending their
actions. They will certainly admit,
also, that if they had no arguments
in their favor they should not have
assailed this paper for questioning
the legality of certain business
which bad been transacted. In
stead of meeting those first ques
tions squarely, the paper was at
tacked for showing so much''ignor
ance 1 ' and such "an abundant mis
understanding of the constitution."
It was asserted in very plain lan
guage that the paper was guilty of
an ''unsafe procedure." Questions
were not answered; they were
"challenged." By this evasion the
paper was put on the defensive from
the start, and if its "ignorance"
had been as great as was taken for
granted it would by that clever
move have been effectually silenced.
But by placing the paper on the
defensive and attacking it, they
have made it necessary for the
paper to vindicate itself by pro
ceeding to show up inconsistencies
and mis-statements.
In the first communication the
president of the student body was
attacked, and it was said: "Ourvery
system of offices lodges these semi
ministerial acts in the treasurer
and manager. They must neces
sarily know better than the presi
dent jnist what is needed " Further
on in the communication the re
sponsibility for the act was shifted
to the Executive Committee. When

the Executive Committee made a
ihit denial, the next communication
said: "The president is given this
power, but not the committee."
How on earth is anybody who is
not thoroughly posted in student
body matters to keep up with this
I game of hide-and-seek? If there
was any desire to make the issue
clear, instead of confusing the ma
jority of our readers, the two gentle
men who wrote the communications
would have decided in advance
'whether it was the president or the
Executive Committee to which they
wanted to attribute the authority.
1 >ul this plan of treating the ques
tion in a "now-you-see-it-and-now
you-don't-see-it" fashion will avail
them nothing. For it needs only
to he asked why both the president
and the Executive Committee were
ignored.
To establish a precedent for let
ting the souvenir contract, it is said
that in 1804 the treasurer let it,
and that "in 1895 the manager
equally unauthorized let the con
tract." The fact that in 189-4 it
was the treasurer and in 1895 the
manager shows that neither one
hiid a definite right in the matter.
But even if they had a right then,
it has nothing to do with the case
now. In April, 1895, the article in
the constitution governing the
treasurer was amended so as to
make a sweeping change in the
office. In April, 1890, the powers
of the managers were materially
abridged by another amendment.
The rules governing the treasurer
and football manager when those
contracts were let have in both
cases been changed very materially,
and an attempt to look back to
either of them as a precedent is
certainly very far-fetched.
It is further stated that the Ex
ecutive Committee last year decided
that to let the contract "was a part
of the treasurer's duty." That
statement is unqualifiedly false.
The editor of this paper was one of
the members of last year's Execu
tive Committee who advocated
letting Mr. Morrison take charge of
last year's souvenir and he is sure
that no one on the committee who
voted for that motion ever had the
faintest idea that he was declaring
it to be a part of the "treasurer's
duty."
That outsiders may understand
the character of the motion in ques
tion we print it in full as it appears
in the minutes:
"Moved and seconded that Mr.
Morrison be given full charge of
the Thanksgiving souvenir at the
football game, and that he be re
quired to render a full account of
the same to the Executive Commit
tee."
The Executive Committee last
year gave the baseball manager
authority to hire a coach. Will
the baseball managers now for all

time to come say that it is a part
of the baseball manager's duty to
hire a coach?
We are sorry to use our space
and time in exploding such flimsy
excuses as these, but the case of
the treasurer and football manager
is left to rest on these arguments
alone and they are so cleverly put
together that a hasty reading on
the part of those unacquainted with
all the facts involved would leave
the impression that this paper's
terrible "accusations" were indeed
without foundation.
We know that many persons will
think that the principle for which
this paper is contending is too in
significant a matter to arouse so
much discussion. But small as it
is, this very point saved the student
body a considerable sum of money
at one time, and there is no reason
why it should not do the same
thing over and over again in the
future. When student body assess
ments are so hard to collect and
are such a bugbear to all who have
to pay them, this point is surely
worthy of some consideration.
Last year, (July, 189(>) while
Treasurer Morrison was in the
East during vacation, the football
manager and student body presi
dent let the contract for erecting
the grandstand at last year's
Thanksgiving game. This was
clearly illegal according to the
clause in the by-laws which reads:
"Managers may contract liabil
ities to the sum of $50, for which
they shall give vouchers to the
auditing committee of the Execu
tive Committee, but shall obtain
consent of the treasurer and presi
dent for every $50 following. If a
manager exceed $50 liabilities

without permission, he shall be
personally responsible."
This contract was let for $2100.
When Mr. Morrison returned and
found what had been done, he was
satisfied that the figure was exorbi
tant. The editor of this paper, be
ing a member of the Executive
Committee at that time, was taken
into Mr. Morrison's confidence and
knew of every step that was taken
in the matter. The contractor was
called down from the city. There
was a meeting in the room of the
president of the student body at
which the president, football man
ager, treasurer, and contractor
were present. The treasurer was
determined to contest the contract
before the student body or in the
courts if necessary and he held out
until the contractor reduced the
amount to $1,300 for the same
work and the same material in
every way for which a contract for
$2,100 had been signed. Here was
a saving of almost a thousand dol
lars which would have been impos
sible but for the clause which
makes the consent of three men
necessary instead of two.
In justice to the men who let the
contract in the first place we should
state that neither the treasurer nor
the writer ever doubted their integ
rity in the matter, but simply be
lieved that they had been imposed
upon. The paper could multiply
instances showing the importance
of the point in question, but it
would certainly be unnecessary.

guage that the paper was guilty of
an ''unsafe procedure." Questions
were not answered; they were
"challenged." By this evasion the
paper was put on the defensive from
the start, and if its "ignorance"
had been as great as was taken for
granted it would by that clever
move have been effectually silenced.
But by placing the paper on the
defensive and attacking it, they
have made it necessary for the
paper to vindicate itself by pro
ceeding to show up inconsistencies
and mis-statements.
In the first communication the
president of the student body was
attacked, and it was said: "Ourvery
system of offices lodges these semi
ministerial acts in the treasurer
and manager. They must neces
sarily know better than the presi
dent jnist what is needed " Further
on in the communication the re
sponsibility for the act was shifted
to the Executive Committee. When

the Executive Committee made a
ihit denial, the next communication
said: "The president is given this
power, but not the committee."
How on earth is anybody who is
not thoroughly posted in student
body matters to keep up with this
I game of hide-and-seek? If there
was any desire to make the issue
clear, instead of confusing the ma
jority of our readers, the two gentle
men who wrote the communications
would have decided in advance
'whether it was the president or the
Executive Committee to which they
wanted to attribute the authority.
1 >ul this plan of treating the ques
tion in a "now-you-see-it-and-now
you-don't-see-it" fashion will avail
them nothing. For it needs only
to he asked why both the president
and the Executive Committee were
ignored.
To establish a precedent for let
ting the souvenir contract, it is said
that in 1804 the treasurer let it,
and that "in 1895 the manager
equally unauthorized let the con
tract." The fact that in 189-4 it
was the treasurer and in 1895 the
manager shows that neither one
hiid a definite right in the matter.
But even if they had a right then,
it has nothing to do with the case
now. In April, 1895, the article in
the constitution governing the
treasurer was amended so as to
make a sweeping change in the
office. In April, 1890, the powers
of the managers were materially
abridged by another amendment.
The rules governing the treasurer
and football manager when those
contracts were let have in both
cases been changed very materially,
and an attempt to look back to
either of them as a precedent is
certainly very far-fetched.
It is further stated that the Ex
ecutive Committee last year decided
that to let the contract "was a part
of the treasurer's duty." That
statement is unqualifiedly false.
The editor of this paper was one of
the members of last year's Execu
tive Committee who advocated
letting Mr. Morrison take charge of
last year's souvenir and he is sure
that no one on the committee who
voted for that motion ever had the
faintest idea that he was declaring
it to be a part of the "treasurer's
duty."
That outsiders may understand
the character of the motion in ques
tion we print it in full as it appears
in the minutes:
"Moved and seconded that Mr.
Morrison be given full charge of
the Thanksgiving souvenir at the
football game, and that he be re
quired to render a full account of
the same to the Executive Commit
tee."
The Executive Committee last
year gave the baseball manager
authority to hire a coach. Will
the baseball managers now for all

time to come say that it is a part
of the baseball manager's duty to
hire a coach?
We are sorry to use our space
and time in exploding such flimsy
excuses as these, but the case of
the treasurer and football manager
is left to rest on these arguments
alone and they are so cleverly put
together that a hasty reading on
the part of those unacquainted with
all the facts involved would leave
the impression that this paper's
terrible "accusations" were indeed
without foundation.
We know that many persons will
think that the principle for which
this paper is contending is too in
significant a matter to arouse so
much discussion. But small as it
is, this very point saved the student
body a considerable sum of money
at one time, and there is no reason
why it should not do the same
thing over and over again in the
future. When student body assess
ments are so hard to collect and
are such a bugbear to all who have
to pay them, this point is surely
worthy of some consideration.
Last year, (July, 189(>) while
Treasurer Morrison was in the
East during vacation, the football
manager and student body presi
dent let the contract for erecting
the grandstand at last year's
Thanksgiving game. This was
clearly illegal according to the
clause in the by-laws which reads:
"Managers may contract liabil
ities to the sum of $50, for which
they shall give vouchers to the
auditing committee of the Execu
tive Committee, but shall obtain
consent of the treasurer and presi
dent for every $50 following. If a
manager exceed $50 liabilities

without permission, he shall be
personally responsible."
This contract was let for $2100.
When Mr. Morrison returned and
found what had been done, he was
satisfied that the figure was exorbi
tant. The editor of this paper, be
ing a member of the Executive
Committee at that time, was taken
into Mr. Morrison's confidence and
knew of every step that was taken
in the matter. The contractor was
called down from the city. There
was a meeting in the room of the
president of the student body at
which the president, football man
ager, treasurer, and contractor
were present. The treasurer was
determined to contest the contract
before the student body or in the
courts if necessary and he held out
until the contractor reduced the
amount to $1,300 for the same
work and the same material in
every way for which a contract for
$2,100 had been signed. Here was
a saving of almost a thousand dol
lars which would have been impos
sible but for the clause which
makes the consent of three men
necessary instead of two.
In justice to the men who let the
contract in the first place we should
state that neither the treasurer nor
the writer ever doubted their integ
rity in the matter, but simply be
lieved that they had been imposed
upon. The paper could multiply
instances showing the importance
of the point in question, but it
would certainly be unnecessary.
