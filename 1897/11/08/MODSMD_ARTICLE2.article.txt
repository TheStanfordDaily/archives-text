# Game and No Game.
## 
### 
The football game between Re
liance and the Varsity did not
come off this afternoon on account
of the non-appearance of the ath
letic club men. The Reliance man
agement and captain promised
Manager Switzer a. game for this
afternoon, and although Captain
Frick knew Saturday night that it
would be impossible to play, he did
not inform Mr. Switzer until noon
today. His late notice came in
the following telegram:
Oakland, Cal., Nov. 8, 1897.
Jno. M. Switzer: â€”Impossible to
come. Can not get but three men
to come. Frick.
