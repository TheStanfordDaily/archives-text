A GOOD WORD FOR SCRUBS.
The "Occident'' Editor Thinks They
Should be Given Better
Treatment.
The following encouraging
words for second eleven men are
; re-printed from the Occident:
i "Our football disaster of last
| year brought out an unusual num
i her of second-eleven men this year.
Among these men, some have a
| chance to make the team. Many
! others have not such hope and are
; merely giving their time and toil
: toward the perfecting of the var-
I sity. We believe these men worthy
I of some consideration.
"The life of a 'scrub' is not at all
; rosy. The 'scrub' is generally a
, trifle too light, or a little too fat,
or somewhat too short, or too long
i —has some slight physical deflec
tion from the ideal football type.
Day after day he lines up against
the varsity men to be thrown and
twisted and battered* in order to
| give the physically-superior gent le
|in en practice. He is ceaselessly
! engaged in unequal struggle against
j superior forces. Looking forward,
the varsity man sees praise and
incense, the glory of representing
his college, perhaps the intoxioa
tionof victory;looking forward, the
'scrub' sees only ceaseless struggle,
constant bruising. His reward is
in the consciousness of duty done,
in the knowledge that his work is
an indissoluble part of the team
1 which represents his college —small
■ reward after a2O to 0 game. In
I short, he is at the toil, without be
i ing at the glory.
"We think these men worthy of
some little consideration. The
present management, however,
seems to do everything possible to
make their duty harder. Economy
is laudable; in this case it conies
dangerously near to avarice. We
speak of the measure which makes
it necessary for second-eleven men
to pay in order to see their team
play.
"The proceeding is painfully
! ridiculous. The 'scrubs' line up,
are battered during the week to
! improve the varsity, and, when the
' varsity plays, the'scrubs' must pay
to see it —must pay to witness the
Iresult of their devotion. The sys
tem is too beautiful to need further
expatiating. We would suggest,
however, if shekels are worthy of
such superior consideration, that
'scrubs 5 be forced to pay for (he
privileges of practicing with the
varsity. Too much can nut lie ex
pected from their patriotism."
