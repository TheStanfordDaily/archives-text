Now that the annual game is
bo near at hand and everything
that will add to the enthusiasm on
the football lield is so much to be
desired, we suggest that the Uni
versity Band hold a few of its
meetings on the grandstand and
help instil life into the practice.
This would give the musicians
good practice for the game, it
would encourage the football men,
and at the tame time tend to make
the rooters more enthusiastic.
