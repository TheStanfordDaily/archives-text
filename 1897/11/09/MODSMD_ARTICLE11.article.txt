Every graduation takes away
some of the strongest and best
members of our musical organiza
tions, and in some cases much dif
ficulty is experienced in lilling
their phices from the entering
classes. It is so at least with the
Ladies' Mandolin Club, a notice of
whose lirst rehearsal of the season
appears in another column. If
there are in the freshman class,
or in any of the other classes of
the University, persons who play
either the guitar or mandolin, they
will be made welcome at tomor
row's rehearsal no matter whether
they are personally known to any
of the present members of the club
or not. if they prefer they may
address the president of the club,
Miss Helen Swett, at the Univer
sity postoffice. For membership in
the club the only requirement is a
moderate reading ability.
