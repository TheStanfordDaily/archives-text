After a social time devoted
to Stanford memories, Mr. J. Mclv.
Wight called the meeting to order
and in a speech full of Stanford en
thusiasm stated the object of ihe

it was moved that it be the sense of
the meeting that a permanent or
ganization be effected. The motion
being carried, a committee on con
stitution was appointed consist
ing of .J. E. Reynolds, Vanderveer,
and Chase. The members of the
committee, having had Constitu
tional History under Professor
Howard, were not long in pie
paring a document which only
needs a few amendments by Zion
to he immortal; it is open to his
suggestion. Permanent organiza
tion for the year was then effected
by the election of Wight, '95, presi
dent, and Labbe, '96, secretary and
treasurer.
The constitution provides that!
all graduates of Stanford residing

plans will lie perfected fora theatre
party at Weber A: Field's, followed
by a banquet at some well-known
cafe, at which time we hope to re

football field.
Great interest was shown in all
Stanford news, the Daily Palo j
At/ros at hand being at a premium.

ball management best wishes fora ;
successful day on Thanksgiving.
There are at present about thirty!
Stanford students in and about j
New York, of which a corrected list
