# Early Practice.
## 
### 
Owing to the inability of several
of the Reliance men to get away,
the game which was to have been
played Monday was called off.
The two teams lined up somewhat
earlier than usual, practice being
over at five o'clock. This is much
more pleasant for the spectators
and it is to be hoped that as far as
possible the work will be done
somewhat earlier hereafter than
has been the custom.
Toward the end of the game the
Varsity brightened up and played
a fast, hard game, running the ball
nearly the length of the field. Cot
ton made the Varsity's two touch
downs, and showed old-time form
at full. James at tackle and
Fickert at'guard also showed them
selves to be in good form. Fisher
put up a strong game at half, but
showed a tendency to run out too
far.
The line-up was as follows:
