and Manager Switzer and Treasurer
Pomeroy met in the Palace Hotel
yesterday and completed arrange
ments for the disposal of the seats
at the coming intercollegiate con
test on Thanksgiving. Besides the
big covered and elevated grand
stands and bleachers which are
already in position in Recreation
Park, ninety feet more of bleachers
will be erected, making the south
side of the gridiron a solid mass of
seats. On the north side, opposite
thejpresent grandstand, new grand
stands, extending back eighteen
tiers and surmounted by a number
of private boxes, will be erected.
The University Club reserves a
thousand chairs in the center of
this long stretch of seats, which will
be placed on sale at $2.50. On
either side of the University Club
seats are the sections reserved for
the lusty-lunged rooters of the two
universities. These seats will be
sold for $1.50, the same price as
last year.
The general price of admission
will be $1.00, which admits one to
standing room on the side-lines but
not at all interfering with the
view of the spectators in the grand
stands or on the bleachers.
The new grandstands will give
an actual seating capacity of 9000,
a few more than were provided foi
at Central Park last year, while
standing room will be arranged for
2000 more.
