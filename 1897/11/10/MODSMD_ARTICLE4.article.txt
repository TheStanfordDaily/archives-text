# A 						GOOD PRACTICE.
## Second Eleven Scores Two Touchdowns and the Varsity One. 
### 
There was a noticeable improve
ment in the work of both teams in
yesterday's practice. The second
was allowed six downs instead of
the usual number and that ac
counts to a considerable degree for
their excellent showing.
The second eleven kicked off to
Daly who ran in live yards. The
Varsity fumbled and Hill fell on
the ball. Bidwell tried the left end
for no gain. The second then fum
bled losing five yards, Cotton fall
ing on the ball.
Second got the ball on an off-side
play and bucked with no gain.
Wardall and Bidwell were both
stopped without gain. Wardall
again tried and made five yards,
James added three, and after a
couple of downs Wardall dashed
around the right end fora pretty
run of twenty yards. With the
ball on the Varsity's three-yard
line, the second tried four times
to push it over without success, but
Bidwell on fifth down went around
right end fora touch-down. The
ball was then brought out to the
live-yard line and after several
downs was again forced over.
The two elevens lined up for the
kick-off, Carle kicking the ball over
the line, necessitating a punt from
the twenty-five-yard line. B.
Thomas fumbled but fell on the
ball after Hill's punt. Daly made
ten yards. The Varsity fumbled,
the ball going to the second team.
Hill punted thirtv-ti ve yards,
Thomas again fumbling and falling
on the ball.
Daly circled the right end for
five yards. Carle went around the
end for fifteen yards but received a
cut over the eye, which made
necessary the change of Woodruff
to the Varsity. After a poor pass
Fisher punted thirty-five yards and
on the first down Hill returned the
sphere about the same distance.
Time called for first half.
During the second period, which
was longer, several substitutions
were made on both teams and each
eleven succeeded in making a
touch-down. Both sides punted
considerably, Hill showing up very
well indeed, his kicks all being
sure and of good distance. Fisher's
punting was strong enough but
was often too low, the ball several
times striking his own line. In his
general work Fisher is playing one
of the hardest games on the field,
his defensive work is excellent,
while his running is steadily im
proving.
Cotton still continues to improve
and plays a fast, snappy game,
which many of the men could well
imitate.
in the guards-back play the
tackles do not have much oppor
tunity for their work to show, but
it can be readily seen by the suc
cess of the play, for upon them the
responsibility of holding the whole
of the opposing line rests. B.
Thomas was at quarter on account
of the absence of Jeffs and was
considerably handicapped !>}' his
inexperience. His handling of
punts is poor.
The "old reliable" center trio is

playing in fine form, Carle and
Fickert being generally sure of
their distance in the new play.
For the second, Hill, Wardall,
James, and Husk put up the best
game, all showing steady improve
ment in their play. Erb at quar
ter also put up a strong game, es
pecially on the defensive. Murphy
was out in his suit but did not take
part in the practice. Charlie Dole,
'98, who played on the Varsity in
1896 and sub-half in 1897, was out
on the field this afternoon for the
first time this season. His work in
the Library hasheretofore kept him
from playing and only by the aid
of the other assistants has he been
able to appear for practice.
