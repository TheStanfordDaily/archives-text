While we are making up our
book of songs, it might be well for
us to keep in mind the fact that
at the big game yells are quite as
necessary as songs, or even more
so. It is well for us to offer
prizes for songs until we have a
large enough collection to suit our
purpose, but these songs are seldom
used except at our rallies, where
they serve a good purpose. Yells
for use at the game, yells to inspire
in our team the effort that wins
the day, are the essential things at
the present time. Any one who has
invented or can invent a good yell
should present it to the yell
leaders, and the men on the grand
stand should bunch up and prac
tice every night from now until
Thanksgiving.
Berkeley will have at the game a
strong yelling force with many
new slogans. U. C. men are de
termined to do all for their team
that support can do, and, unless
we are willing to be outdone in
ingenuity and united work, we
should fall in line and get into
trim for the yelling contest two
weeks from tomorrow. We can
help win the game and now is the
time to prepare.
