We extend congratulations to
our friends across the bay upon
their having succeeded at last in
securing a vacation for their team
before the Thanksgiving game. It
is not yet known whether the Stan
ford team will take its usual trip
this year or not, but if it had been
allowed to take a rest while its op
ponents were forced to remain at
Berkeley, Stanford men would have
felt that they had an unfair ad
vantage in the contest which it
soon to take place.
