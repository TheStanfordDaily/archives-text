# Berkeley Players Get a Vacation.
## 
### 
Twenty of California's football
men left Berkeley early this morn
ing for Del Monte, where they will
hold secret practice for the two
weeks between now and Thanks
giving. There had been some
faculty objection to the men going
away, but this was done away with
when a petition asking for leave of
absence was presented to President
Kellogg signed by Gov. Budd and
other prominent alumni. Presi
dent Kellogg granted their request
and now the U. C. pig-skin chasers
will round into form at the seaside.
