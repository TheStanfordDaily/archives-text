						Good Practice.

### 
The practice yesterday was very
satisfactory. All the men played a
hard game, though neither side
made a touch-down. The only
score of the game was made by a
field goal on a drop-kick by Hill.
The Varsity allowed the second
team twice the ordinary number of
downs in order to keep matters
even.
The Varsity kicked off to Ballan
tyne and Scoville punted on the
first down. Fickert ploughed the
line four yards and on the next
play Rusk broke through and
stopped the play without gain.
Daly made the linest run of the
practice around the right end un
der excellent interference, netting
sixty yards. The second eleven
took the ball and Hill punted
thirty-five yards. The Varsity
tried the center without gain and
Rusk blocked Fickert's try for an
end run, Daly made three yards and
then Fisher punted. On the first
down Hill kicked it back for thirty
five yards to Parker. The ball was
soon run down to the Varsity's
lifteen-yard line, but here the line
held like a stone wall, and Hill was
forced to kick and succeeded in
dropping a field goal.
James was placed on the Varsity
and several other changes were
made. The second kicked off to
Cotton, who ran it in four yards.
Daly gained ten yards around the
right end and, after a fumble of the
pass by Fisher, gained ten more.
Parker made two good runs during
the remainder of the game, one of
them being nearly twenty-five
yards.
Carle, Murphy, and Jeffs are not
playing, but they will all probably
be in Saturday's game if nothing
happens. Rusk put up a strong

game at tackle as usual, but still
does not use his head as much as
he should. Daly did some fine
ground gaining under the guards
bark interference. Cotton was at
quarter and played a fine game,
especially in the interference and
in blocking the ends on punts.
Erb, Ballantyne, and Hill all put
up their usual steady game for the
second.
