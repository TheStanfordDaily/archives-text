# BERKELEY'S HOPE GONE.
## The 						"Occident" Thinks that Ridiculous Defeat Awaits U.C. 
### 
The following mournful editorial
in the Occident should not lead
Stanford men to be over-confident.
Berkeley has always been confi
dent heretofore, and has lost. By
changing her tactics she may give
us some surprises this year.
"If there remained any uncon
scious bit of hope in our breasts,
any half-hushed illusion as to our
football prospects, they have van
ished. The cardinal sun floods
the blue out of the sky with its
lurid hue. It seems our inexorable
destiny to be eternally beaten. We
must face the situation squarely.
If there has been any thought that
the 20 to 0 score has served as an
anaesthetic to Stanford endeavor, it
is now quite successfully squelched.
Our enemies are wide awake; they
have a good coach. It will take all
our energy, all the concentration of
endeavors possible, to prevent a
most ignoble defeat on Thanksgiv
ing day. It is to be hoped that all
rise to the situation. We can not
hope to win ; we can at least make
a supreme effort not to be ridicu
lous in our defeat.
"Our defeat last Saturday is the
story of an opportunity lost. The
freshmen had the game in their
hands. They went to sleep and
awoke to find it irretrievably lost.
''And thus have been all our
football defeats—pathetic instances
of lost opportunities. Let us ex
amine the situation.
"In 1894 and 1895 we won the
freshman games; in 189(5 and 1897
we lost them. There are now, both
at California and at Stanford, two
victorious and two defeated classes,
i.e., equality in material.
"And what have we done with
our material? In 1894 we win the
freshman game; we lose on Thanks
giving day. In 1895 our entering
material is infinitely superior to
Stanford's, our freshmen crush
theirs overwhelmingly; we tie Stan
ford —a miserable, hard-won tie —
on Thanksgiving day. The eternal
example of the gigantic opportun

ity lost —lost, thrown away,
spurned.
"Let us turn to Stanford. In
1896 they win their first freshman
game; on Thanksgiving day they
crush us 20 to 0. In 1897 they win
their second freshman game; be
sure that they will not lose the op
portunity of superior entering
material.
"The lesson which can be deduced
from this is as follows: The foot
ball material entering the univer
sities is as a whole nearly equal.
Stanford develops this into win
ning teams; we —we —well, what in
the devil do we do with it?
"We squander it, we kill it off,
we stunt its growth. Our goodwill
is unquestionable; we try hard
enough. But we do not know how to
direct this rushing herd of endeavor.
We let them rotate, bumping into
each other with paralyzing effect,
rotate desperately without advanc
ing. In other words, we have no
system, no conduct-shaping tradi
tion. We change coaches, we
change systems. We go to the
right and then to the left, some
times backward and never forward.
"At Stanford, all is different.
Stanford has had the good fortune
to have its football infancy nursed
by one of the greatest coaches in
the country. Success gave confir
mation to this system, and Stanford
has now a tradition, a winning
tradition, against 'which all our
wild and disordered efforts shatter
themselves inexorably.
"The remedy is easy to invent,
extremely difficult to execute. We
must form our football policy, a
tradition which will guide us. We
have made this year an effort to
systematize. We must keep this
up without discouragement, nor
vain illusion. The work must
necessarily be slow; many years
may pass before evidence of im
provement. We must all work
silently and patiently. The re
ward will come some day."
