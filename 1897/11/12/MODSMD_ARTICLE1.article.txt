# AN INTERESTING PRACTICE.
## The 						Varsity Makes Up for Lost Time in Scoring Against the Second. 
### 
Yesterday's practice was an in
teresting one for the spectators.
Jeffs and Murphy were out, having
recovered almost entirely from their
injuries, and both teams played a
strong game. The Varsity made
up somewhat in the score line for
the past week and succeeded in
getting points in quite a variety of
ways.
The total score amounted to
seventeen points and was made
from a safety, a place-kick from
the field, and two touch-downs,
from one of which a goal was
kicked, the other not being at
tempted. In addition to this,
Murphy narrowly escaped making
more points from a field goal, his
drop-kick missing the bar by less
than a foot.
Fisher and Carle were not out
and Parker played the right-half
on the Varsity, while Jerry Rusk
was transferred to guard on the
first team, llice and James were
both tried at tackle and both
played a good game. Chet Thomas
put up a fine offensive game.
Smith, Jeffs, and Leavitt were on
the ends and played a very even
game, Smith being surer on punts
perhaps than his competitors.
The Varsity displays a lack of
knowledge of the signals, which is
not very encouraging at present,
and it is to be hoped that they will
soon get them down in belter form.
Cotton's game at full shows daily
improvement and his work can be
depended on for good results. Daly
excelled Parker at half and made
some fine end runs with the guard
interference. Mr.rphy punted in
his old-time form and did some
pretty goal kicking. His drop
kicks are, however, still uncertain,
though they are improving. Bal
lantyne played his usual steady
game, while Morgan at showed
considerable improvement in de
fensive work, lie is one of the
fastest men on the whole field in
getting down on kicks. Huston
played, and has been playing, a
remarkably good game fora man
of his weight. He often breaks
through the line and is a good
tackier.
