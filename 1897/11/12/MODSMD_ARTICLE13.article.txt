While we tire all wrapped up in
football and are awaiting the dawn
of Thanksgiving with breathless
impatience, we should not forget
that there are other contests in
which we are to appear before the
year is over. Stanford's chances
on the track this year will be about
as slim as Berkeley's chances have
been heretofore on the gridiron un
less the members of the student
body begin at once to give our
track men every encouragement. It
is hard to estimate the value of
habit in winning victories —and it
is certainly about time for us to
get into the habit of beating Berke
ley on the track.
