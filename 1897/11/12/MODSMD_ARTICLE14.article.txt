The members of the University
Orchestra who are making prepara
tions to take part in the Thanks
giving show are in great need of
certain instruments which they are
unable to find. Two kettle-drums
costing about two hundred dollars,
a bass viol which was worth about
twenty-live dollars, and about forty
dollars worth of music are missing.
This makes over two hundred and
fifty dollars worth of student body
property which has disappeared
since last Thanksgiving. We do
not know who is at fault, but we
suggest that the Executive Com
mittee appoint a committee of in
vestigation to look into the matter
at once.
