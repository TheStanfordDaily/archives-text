# Reliance vs. Varsity.
## 
### 
The last sceduled game of the
series between Stanford and Re
liance will he played at Recreation
Park tomorrow at 3 o'clock.
Reliance has so far won but one

game from the two university
teams and feels as if this last at
tempt should be worthy of their
greatest effort. Bert Oliver, the
star guard of last year's eleven,
will be at tackle and all the men
who were laid off a week ago will
be in the game. Tommy Code will
be at quarter with Morse, Carter,
and Wyckoff behind him. This
combination of backs alone can be
relied upon to do some star play
ing, and when they play behind
such a line as will appear for the
maroon and white, our men will
have to put up their most brilliant
game in order to win.
The Varsity will go up with most
of the men in splendid condition.
Murphy has not quite recovered,
but will be seen in the game fora
while at least. Carle's eye is still
tender, but if no additional injury
is received, he will hold down his
old position. Erb will probably be
given a chance at quarter, and
Smith may go in at end.
The line-up of the two teams
will be as follows:
STANFORD RELIANCE
Jeffs 1 end r Sherman
Rice 1 tackle r Erskine
Fiekert 1 guard r Sheehy
