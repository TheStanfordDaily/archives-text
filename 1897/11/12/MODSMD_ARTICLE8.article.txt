# Women's Waiting-Room.
## 
### 
The women's sitting-room has
been put in shape and is now open
for the use of the students. The
committee in charge has been
hard at work making known their
wants to their friends and the room
is already much more comfortable
than it was last year. Gifts are
especially acknowledged from Mrs.
M.G. C. Campbell, Mrs. George
Parkinson, Mrs. E. Y. Adams, and
Miss Boring. The committee could
find good use, however, for any or
all of the following articles: a
bracket lamp, one or more rugs, a
table cover, another chair or two, a
small tea-kettle, several sofa cush
ions, a small stand, and some
potted plants. The prevailing
colors in the room are terra-cotta,
light blue, and brown, If any of
the students or their friends have
any of the needed articles in har
monious colors, that they could give
as a loan for the year, tbey would
be much appreciated; such a per
son could communicate with Miss
Amy Gerrans or Miss Katherine
Adams.
