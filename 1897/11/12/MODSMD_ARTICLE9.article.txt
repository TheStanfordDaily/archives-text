Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The Christian Association has
had to contend witli many obsta
cles, and-perhaps the chief one has
been a lack of definite organization
or a pre-arranged program of work.
There has been no membership
whatever in the association, and
this was probably wise while there

was no duty incumbent' on the
members other than that of at
tending a weekly meeting. But
there has been a growing feeling
this year that the association must
fill a broader place in the Univer
sity life. To this end it is proposed
to plan for social gatherings which
shall reach a class of students al
most ignored in the social life of
the University, to organize excur
sions, and other means of giving a
more homelike feeling to many
who are almost like strangers
among us. To organize this work
a definite membership is necessary,
and therefore next Sunday even
ing all those who are willing to
lend a helping hand will be asked
to sign a membership roll. This
will entail the acceptance of no
creed, nor of any pledgfe of any
kind. All that will be expected of
any member will be an apprecia
tion of the aims of the association
and a purpose to aid in its work in
every way possible. To succeed,
the association needs much new
material, and we trust that this ap
peal may have a very generous
response. A. W. Greeley.
