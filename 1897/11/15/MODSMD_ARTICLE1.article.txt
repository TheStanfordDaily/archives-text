# STANFORD DEFEATED.
## The 						Cardinal Goes Down Before the Maroon and White. 
### 
The Varsity was outplayed Sat
urday. No other reason can be as
signed for the victory of the maroon
and white. Our men played the
hardest game that they could, but
the heavy aggregation from around
the bay was simply not to he beaten;
they went in to win and had both
the team and the spirit to do it.
They lined up a wonderfully strong
team. Such a set of running and
bucking backs has seldom played
together on this Coast. Code, the
cool-headed quarter, ran his team
like the veteran he is, and fault
lessly directed the plays; his quar
ter-hack kicks especially worked
like a charm and many yards were
gained on them. Behind him were
three hacks who play football for
all there is in them. Men who
know how to start fast, to run hard,
and to use their head at all times.
Sea right was at full and played
with that dash and abandon for
which he is noted, without, how
ever, engaging in any of those in
dividual contests for which he is
also famous.
Of the Reliance team little need
be said. They worked like fiends
and put up just such a game as a
a lot of veterans can; especially
when they have but one hope leit
The whole eleven gave as pretty an
exhibition as one could see of the
science of team work in football.
Everyone played with his eyesopen
and when one man was tackled
there was always a helping hand,
a good shove to make him fall in
the right direction; and what is
more important, too, when our men
were-tackled there was always the
same shoving, which lost us many
yards.
It was a bruising contest from
start to tinish. The -athletic club
men started out with a pace which
all thought could not last but which
was kept up through the game.
Erb was stationed at quarter
when the b;ill was first kicked off
and remained in the game fora
considerable part of the half, when
Murphy took his place. Fisher
kicked while Erb was at quarter
did ar.d well, being sure and strong
in alj his punting.
Reliance made most of their gains
on plays directed against the tackles
and worked most on the left side of
our line. The guards-back play was
tried and though it did not at first
succeed very well, several good
gains were made with it. Our
backs did not start with the same
quickness exhibited by their op
ponents, and did not play as fast
a game as they were expected to.
The Reliance interference showed
up as strong as expected and it
could not be stopped without gain
by our men. Code's quarter-kicks
were very valuable for his team,

but should have been called offside
for the reason that the ends wen
ahead of the ball almost every
time it was kicked. They would
stand behind Code and would start
immediately on the ball |>eing
passed, not waiting for it to be
kicked. Lanyon excelled at this
play and made several large gains
by its pretty execution. Percy
Morse is the best halfback on the
Coast and Carter, his side partner,
is not far behind him. Seldom did
they fail to gain their distance and
many times would be yards away
from the pile'up. Wyckoff re
placed Morse during the second
half and his fresh strength was
another welcome addition to the
winning team.
The game Saturday will be of
much advantage to the men, not
from the mere fact of being beaten,
hut for the reason that the weak
places in the team have been shown
while there is yet opportunity for
them to be strengthened. All the
men are to be highly praised for the
hard-fought game they put up, and
no one has reason to lose confi
dence in the team's being able to
play a hard game on Thanksgiv
ing day.
