Saturday's defeat, if it lists n<
other results, should mt least lessen
that absurd feeling of complacent*.}
with which we regard theapproach
iug contest. Last year's great vic
tory may he responsible for this,
in addition to the lugubrious wail
of the U. C. Occident. A little mort
than a week from the big game,
and there is as yet scarcely any
evidence of its approach. There is
as yet no enthusiasm. Half of the
spectators on the bleachers sit in
solemn silence every evening and
look at the practices with a critical
eye, the other half yell from a
sense of duty. One of the saddest
features of the game Saturday was
the yelling, (liven in a perfunctor}
sort of manner by a few scattered
students, it had no inspiring effect
on the team. With the departure
of the team only a few days dis
tant, there areas yet no plans fora
rally. Every one is still tranquil,
still complacent. If we can arouse
ourselves from our lethargy, if we
can help put spirit into the players
and practices, by all means let us
do it. From now on until the
team leaves for the hills, this place
should be alive with enthusiasm,
and the Varsity should be made to
feel that the old-time Stanford
spirit still exists as strong as ever,
if once aroused, and that in Un
contest on Thanksgiving day the
college will, in spirit, be back of
trie team in its efforts for victory.
