# Carnot Debate.
## 
### 
The Carnot Debate this year will
be held in Berkeley on the first
Friday in February. The subject
for discussion will be taken from
Baron Coubertin's book on the
'"Evolution of France under the
Third Republic." The general
subject will be announced in De
cember; the specific question will
be given to the debaters seven days
before the debate takes place.
