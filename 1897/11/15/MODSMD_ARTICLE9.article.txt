# Harvard 0, Yale 0.

### 
Harvard and Yale met at Cam
bridge, Mass., Saturday for their
first football game since three years
ago, and for two hours the sturdy
elevens struggled for football su
premacy. Harvard should have
won for she had more possibilities
than the sons of Eli, which she did
not employ to their limit. The
game was devoid of star plays and
was a hard fought contest from the
kick-off. Yale's supposed superior
kicking qualities did not material
ize, for Harvard's punter succeeded
in holding his own against the
wind. Houghton, for Harvard,
was guilty of several bad fumbles,
while the Yale backs were poor in
judging the punts and were not
sure in their catches. About
25,000 people witnessed the game.
