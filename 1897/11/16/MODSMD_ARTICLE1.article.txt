# A
						HARD PRACTICE.
## By Fast Playing the Second Team Scores Twice on the Varsity. 
### 
Last evening the first and second
elevens lined up for the beginning
of a week of hard and consistent
work. Contrary to the usual cus
tom of light practice on Monday
following a big game, the practice
last evening was characterized by
hard work. Neither Jeffs, Carle,
nor Fisher wereout. James played
at guard and Leavitt and Smith at
end on the Varsity. The second
eleven showed up in good form nnd
succeeded in scoring two touch
downs against the Varsity. The
practice was fast and most interest
ing to the spectators.
Hill kicked off to Murphy who
ran the ball in ten yards. Line
bucks were tried with no gain.
Murphy punted thirty yards and
llill returned kick on first down.
Murphy made a fair catch from
Hill's punt and returned it. Hill
caught it and ran the ball in five
yards. "Wardall bucked tackle for
small gain. Second eleven fum
bled and Fickert fell on the ball.
Daly then made a neat run of fif
teen yards around the right end
under good interference. A series*
of bucks and left-end runs were
tried and the ball went to second
team on downs. Rusk made a
splendid buck through tackle fora
big gain. On the next down W'ar
dall broke through with a clean
field before him and made a touch
down. Goal not tried.
Fickert kicked off for Varsity;
Hill ran the ball in five yards.
After failures to make gain by
bucking the line, Hill made a ne;it
punt to Murphy who ran the ball
in twenty yards and was downed
by Dole. Cotton bucked tackle for
good gain. The ball went to sec
ond team on a fumble. Hill kicked,
Murphy fumbled the catch, and
Biglow fell on the ball.
Second eleven went to bucking
the Varsity line quite effectively
and time was called.
During the second half, Dole
made another touch-down for the
second team after picking up a
fumbled ball. Fickert, Scoville,
and Cotton went through the line
for large gains. When on the
twenty-yard line Murphy made a
successful drop-kick for goal. Daly
made some good gains with the
guards-back interference.
For the second team Rusk, W'ar
dall. Hill, and Dole put up a cap
ital game. Erb was not in the
game and Smith played quarter.
The line-up was as follows:

the spectators for so long. I lie
