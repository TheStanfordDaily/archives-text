TUESDAY - - NOVEMBER Hi, 1897

We wish to correct our friend,
the editor of the Occident, in his
statement last week that the Stan
ford football team was already at
Congress Springs "gathering its
energies for the final struggle." The
Stanford team is still on the
campus and will not leave for
Congress Springs until next Friday
morning.

A meeting of the student body
has been called for Thursday night
to sing the Stanford songs and
practice on the new yells for the
coining game. This meeting will
be in the nature of a rally just be
fore the departure of the team for
Congress Springs. A large number
should come out so that the foot
ball team may go away with the
firm conviction that every student
is interested in it. Every individ
ual on the team should be made to
feel that the student body has con
fidence in him and expects him to
do his part in bringing victory to
the cardinal.
