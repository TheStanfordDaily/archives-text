Editor Daily Palo Alto:
If the '98 team, in its broad
challenge in last night's Daily
Palo Alto, aims at a game with
1900, the present class champions
of the University, 1900 would like
to reply that if the '1)8 team will
show by defeating the Freshman
team, or some strong "prep" team,
that they have improved since
1900 so summarily defeated them
when the two teams last met, 1900
will gladly consider their challenge.
Gko. A. Scoville, Mgr. 1900.
