The following communication
was received today from the Ameri
can Committee of the Stevenson
Memorial. Contributions may be
sent to the committee at 38 Union
Square, New York City.
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
It has been proposed to erect in
his native city of Edinburgh a
memorial to Robert Louis Steven
son, and a committee of his Scotch
and English admirers and friends,
headed I»y Lord Rosehery and hav
ing among its number those as near
to Stevenson as Mr. Sidney Colvin,
Mr. George Meredith, and Mr. J.
M. Barrie, has been already formed
to carry out the project. But Stev
enson is nowheie held in greater
admiration or affection than in
America, and u seems certain that
many of his American readers
would be glad of an opportunity to
take part in this tribute to his
memory. Many of them have felt
through his books the vital and
stimulating personality that made
him one of the most, attractive lig
ures in recent English literature;
and the idea of this memorial has
appealed to them with an unusual
force.
With the authority of the Eng
lish organization an American
Committee has been formed, which
asks American readers and ad
mirers of Stevenson to contribute
to the work. The memorial is to
take the shape of a "statue, bust, or
medallion with such architectural
or sculpturesque accompaniment as
may be desirable," and the char
acter of those having the matter in
charge ensures its dignity and fit
ness.
Subscriptions of whalever amount
will be received for the American
Committee by the undersigned, its
chairman, and receipts returned in
the name of the committee. To
the subscribers of sums of $10 and
upward there will be sent by the
American Committee, as a memor
ial of participation in the under
taking, a special edition, printed
for the Committee, of Stevenson's
'vEs Triplex," bearing the sub
scriber's name and having as its
frontispiece a reproduction of the
portrait by John S. Sargent. It
need hardly be said that this edi
tion will not he otherwise obtain
able. Charles Fairchild,
Chairman.
