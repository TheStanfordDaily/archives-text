# MUSICAL CLUBS.
## University Musicians Give a Good Concert to a Crowded House. 
### 
The Glee and Mandolin Clubs
nave a good performance in Nor
tree Hall, Palo Alto, Saturday
evening to a crowded house, which
enjoyed and applauded every num
ber of the program. The clubs
this year are in good condition,
several of the new men being valu
able additions. The Glee Club is
stronger in the tenor parts than
last year, and the Mandolin Club
plays its music in a way that is
entertaining, to say the least.
Messrs. Riley and Rosborough are
a strong team, each being an artist
in his own specialties, which are
wholly distinct in character. If
the clubs continue to improve as
they have since their San Jose con
cert they will undoubtedly score a
hit in the Thanksgiving night
show.
