# Friday Night's Concert.
## 
### 
The (ilee and Mandolin Clubs
will give their first concert on the
campus this year Friday evening
in the chapel. The clubs have
given two concerts already this
year, one in San .lose and one in
Palo Alto, and in each they received
a cordial reception.
The Glee Club now has twenty
two members and the Mandolin
Club sixteen, all of whom have
been practicing diligently since the
beginning of the semester. Both
clubs are now in fine shape fora
concert and their full strength will
appear in Friday's concert. The
program which will be rendered is
entirely new and will be different
even from the one given in Palo
Alto Saturday evening. Among
other things the Glee Club will
sing some of the football songs and
the concert will be somewhat in the
nature of a football rally.
The tickets will be on sale at the
University postoffice tomorrow at
10:30 a.in. Reserved seats are
thirty-five cents.
