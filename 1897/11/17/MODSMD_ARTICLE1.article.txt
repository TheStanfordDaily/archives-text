interference than has been the
order in the past few days. The
play was fast from the start. The

as usual, blocking the Varsity
backs in good form. I he -second

own account. Daly did some fine
end running with good interference.

halves on the scrub team, ran
strong. The defensive work of the
Varsity was not of the best.

should be, hut played with a des
peration that speaks well. Jeffs
ran in fine style with the ball.

his old form in bucking, but the
Varsity allowed itself to be pushed
back time and again by the second,
which played a furious game under
the encouragement of Captain Erb.
