# Sharp Practice.
## 
### 
Neither Varsity nor second team
could score yesterday afternoon
though the ball was once within
the second's five-yard line. Cotton
and Fickert did not play durng
the first part of the practice, while
Carle, Rice and Jeffs, though out
in suits, were not in the game at
all. Parker and Smith were not
out and the end positions were
filled by Leavitt and P. Smith.
Murphy made two attempts at field
goals, one a drop, the other from a
fair catch, but he failed in both.
The Varsity again showed a fail
ing which was exhibited to a such
marked degree in the game Satur
day, that of not properly backing
up the runner. Daly made some
pretty dashes around the end but
the interference was on the whole
not very good. Murphy made two
star runs, one for almost forty
yards.
For the second team Dole, Sco
ville and Huston put up the best
game. Dole made some good
tackles behind the line and ran
well with the ball.
Second team kicked off to
Murphy who ran in ten yards.
Murphy punted and Beckley fell
on the ball. The second then
started back, gaining at every
down and then lost the ball on a
fumble after gaining fifteen yards.
Varsity failed to make their dis
tance and Murphy punted but the
play was called off-side and second
team was given the ball. Making
no gain .Jost punted for thirty
yards and Huston downed Hill in
his tracks.
Daly worked the right end for
fifteen yards and Hill went through
guard for four yards. Second got
the ball but immediately fumbled,
Leavitt falling on it.
Fickert was substituted for
Adams and Jost was transferred
from the second to fill Fisher's
place at right half, Wardall going
on t he second.
The ball was carried to the ten
yard line but lost on an off-side
play. Scoville punted to Murphy
who made a fair catch on the
thirty-yard line. The try for field
goal failed.
Scoville kicked out from the
twenty-five-yard line, Murphy
fumbled and tried to kick the ball
on the ground. Second got t he ball
and, not being able to gain, Scoville

punted, Murphy making a pretty
run-in of fifteen yards. Murphy
punted for fifty yards, the ball going
over Beekley's head. f-'coville's
kick was blocked and the Varsity,
getting the ball, bucked to the four
yard line and there lost it on an
off-side play. Scoville punted thirty
and Murphy ran in fifteen. Sec
ond got the ball on a fumble and
Scoville punted ten yards to Hill.
Murphy tried a drop but was
blocked, Daly falling on the ball.
Daly was thrown back with no gain
by Dole and on the third down
with eight yards to gain Murphy
tried for a field-goal but fell short
and time was called for the prac
tice.
Code and Harrelson assisted Mr.
Brooke with the Varsity while
Billy Erb instilled ginger into the
second team. The largest crowd of
the year to attend practice filled
the bleachers and side-lines and
succeeded in giving the old yell in
regulation style.
