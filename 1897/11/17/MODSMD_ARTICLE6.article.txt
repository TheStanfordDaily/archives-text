# The 						Thanksgiving Show
## 
### 
This year's show is to he a no
table departure in the line of Thanks
giving performances. Formerly
the main feature has been vaude
ville. This year the ambitious
local amateurs are going to try
farce-comedy. W. H. Irwin's "Con
version of Uncle," a football farce
with local hits and vaudeville fea
tures will hold the hoards this year.
Several new features in the line of
local "joshes" are darkly hinted at
by the management, who have also
some new vaudeville features "up
their sleeve."
The first design was to produce
the show with the Junior Farce cast
of last spring, but there was much
objection to permitting University
women to act in San Francisco.
The management, therefore,
"worked over'' the show and the
cast. The new performance will
introduce two shy but talented
maidens from Vassar, who will take
the female parts in the perform
ance.
The Glee and Mandolin Clubs
have prepared some new musical
numbers for the show, and the or
chestra is in daily rehearsal. The
entire "company" will include over
fifty students.
