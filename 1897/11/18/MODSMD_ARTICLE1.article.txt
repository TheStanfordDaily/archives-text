# LAST LINE-UP ON CAMPUS.
## Today's Practice Was Hard and Fast.—Varsity Men Not Yet in Perfect Form. 
### 
The largest and most enthusias
tic crowd of Stanford spectators
of the season greeted the teams this
afternoon. The grandstand was
filled and before the practice the
crowd amused themselves by sing
ing some of the new songs. "Bill"
Irwin led the yelling, which was
the best of the season. At the
kick-off the yell was given with
much vim and enthusiasm.
As coaches, in addition to Mr.
Brooke, Code, Harrelson, Franken
heinier, and Downing were on the
field and each one received a
hearty welcome. Before lining up
Coach Brooke announced the
names of the players who leave for
the Springs tomorrow. They are
given elsewhere. Fisher, Carle,
Rice, and Jeffs did not line-up with
the team. Jost took Fisher's
place, Woodruff took Carle's, and
Leavitt Smith's. The features of
the play in the first half we re Cot
ton's bucking, Murphy's running
and punting, and Erb's tackling.
Murphy made a pretty run of
twenty yards on a punt by Hill,
eluding Mill and Code —the latter
though not playing, had on his
suit and could not resist the temp
tation of attempting a tackle. Erb
finally brought him down by a
pretty tackle. The play was fast
and interesting. The cheering was
frequent.
Hill kicked off for forty-five
yards to Murphy. Varsity made
no gains in three downs and Mur
phy punted forty to Hill. Varsity
took the ball on an off-side play
and made a yard on the guards
back play. Jost gained four
through tackle, Woodruff three.
Cotton then made a pretty buck of
eight. Several plays did not gain
and a quarterback kick to Leavitt
gained twenty. Daly did not gain
and Murphy kicked a pretty field
goal.
Second kicked off to Fickert, who
made five yards, and then two
more around the end. Varsity
fumbled to the second. Wardall
made three through tackle, Dole
gained but was shoved back. Var
sity's ball on downs. Cotton
gained fifteen yards through right
tackle. Thomas was thrown back
by Dole. Jost fumbled, Huston
fell on ball. Wardall gained two
yards for the second, Dole one,
Hill none. Varsity's ball on
downs.
No gain on first down. Daly
made one on the second. Leavitt
made five on Cotton's quarter
back kick. Daly made a seven
yard run, and Erb made a fine
tackle. Second's ball on a decision
by referee.
After an exchange of punts with
no gain, Fickert gained three
through the center, and Daly two
around right end. Erb got the
ball on a quarter kick. Hill punt
ed forty-five yards to Murphy, who
ran in twenty. Murphy punted,
Erb ran in seven, and the first half
ended.
The play in the second half was
fast and hard. Cotton, Murphy,
and Fickert all put up good games.
Erb, Dole, and Wardall did good

work in holding down the Varsity.
The second half opened with sonic
pretty punts and runs. Murphy
kicked off for forty-five yards to
Dole who ran it in twenty-five. Mill
punted forty to Murphy who inn It'
a sensational run of thirty yards,
being tackled by Hill. The second
held the Varsity down and forced
them to kick. Hill kicked the ball
over Murphy's head for sixty yards
and Beck ley made a spend id
tackle. Parker made a pretty run
of twenty-five.yards around the left
end and Daly went around the
other end for four yards.
The second got the ball on downs,
lost it to the Varsity and regained
it by a blocked kick by Beckley,
Dole falling on the ball. The sec
ond eleven bucked, netted five
yards through the Varsity center
and then tried the Varsity tackles
with less success. By working the
backs through center and tackles
and one run by James through left
tackle for three yards the second
eleven gradually advanced the ball.
With three minutes to play the
Varsity held and took the ball on
downs. Daly gained around the
right end and Leavitt made a sixty
live-yard run around the same end
fora touch-down, dodging Erb who
was the only man near him. The
teams lined up on the thirty-live
yard line. Daly worked the right
end for ten yards and the whistle
blew.
The practice tonight showed that
the Varsity is in far from perfect
form. The men did not back each
other up as they might, and the
line men stand too high. And the
team as a whole did not play with
the unison which denotes line team
work. This may be accounted for
by the absence of Fisher, Carle,
Rice, and Jeffs.
The line-up was as follows:
