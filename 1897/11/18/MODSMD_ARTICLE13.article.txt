The Freshman Class is larger by
far than any other class in the
University and still it has been
found almost impossible to secure
a quorum of twenty-five at the
class meetings. Either ihe class
has been considering its business in
such small doses that the number
of meetings has become tiresome or
the freshmen are too busy satis
fying the demands of the professors
to attend to important class busi
ness. It would be a good plan to
hold one genuine business meeting
and then take a rest.
