# LAST NIGHT'S RALLY.
## The 						Most Enthusiastic Meeting Since the Winning of the Suit. 
### 
Never since the decision of the
Stanford suit has there been such
enthusiasm shown on the campus
as broke loose at the football rally
last night. By seven o'clock it was
impossible for another person to be
jammed through the doors into the
chapel. After many inquiries for
President Morgan and the Band,
the Glee Club was finally called
upon to give "Chin Chin China
man." The singing of this song
was heartily received and it was
called for over and over again dur
ing the evening.
A little after seven o'clock the
University Baud, headed by the
president of the student body, ar
rived on the outside. The Band
could not gain admittance and
the president had to be pushed in
through a window.
Mr. Morgan called upon Mr.
Bradley and various other speakers
until the enthusiasm attained such
a height that the audience called
for first one speaker and then
another without waiting long for
any one of them to respond. In
this way speeches were obtained
irom most of the members of the
team, from Manager Switzer, Coach
Brooke, Irwin, Harrelson, Code,
Archie Rice, MacKinnon, Filcher,
Elias, and Professors Still man and
Duniway.
Manager Switzer complimented
the team and thanked the captain
and the men for the treatment he
had received at their hands while
"growing hoarse in their service."
He ended by proposing three
cheers for the team and the Uni
versity, which were given with a
vengeance.
Coach Brooke expressed his ap
preciation of the pleasant relations
which had existed between him and
the students and took occasion to
thank the student body for the en
thusiasm and interest shown by
those who had been on the bleach
ers at the practices. He also re
marked that he had been "joshed"
enough on the football field to sat
isfy almost any man.
Captain Cotton was not over
sanguine, but spoke of the team
and its prospects in a conversative
manner. He praised the manage
ment especially and said that
everything had been done for the
men which could be done.
Fickert was loudly called for
during the evening and as the tall
form of the popular ex-captain ap
peared in the back part of the room
there was deafening applause.
Fickert paid a delicate compliment
to his successor, Captain Cotton, in
the course of his speech. His re
marks about this year's team were
roundly applauded.
Archie Rice, '95, of the Call,
spoke of the prospects of victory
and outlined the probable line-up
of the opposing team. He sat down
amid cheers for "Jack Rice's
brother."
Harrelson, '95, and Code, '96,
spoke of the good points of the
team as viewed from the stand
point of old players. The volume
of music outside forced both of
them to cut their remarks short.
Professor Still man appeared as

acting head of the University
speak a parting word to the t<* i
He urged them to play wii.ii <■ u
ine Stanford spirit and as- to
them that we would honor the ■>
our team still, no matter wheiluT
they came back victorious or with
the Stanford type of defeat —a tie.
Professor Duniway gave the
rooters a short talk on their "sec
ond wind" and illustrated it with
a story about the principal product
of Kansas. He also told about a
governor of Ohio who wanted to
turn away an office-seeker and said
to his secretary "You know what
to give, him." The rooters ''caught
on" at once and responded with
the famous "(.Jive 'em the ax" yell.
Professor Duniway urged the men
to play clean ball, fast ball, and
hard ball, and never to mind about
the result. He said he had no
patience with people who called
football a brutal game. "What's
the use of living," he said, "if there
aren't a few necks broken now and
then? There are lots of people in
this world whose necks ought to be
broken." "Berkeley, Berkeley,"
suggested the rooters, and there was
general laughter.
After these two professors had
spoken Professor Angell was called
for. "Let the angels come," called
a dee]) voice. The angels didn't
come, but the holy scriptures did.
All the hymn-books in one section
of the house gravitated all at once
toward the bald-headed row.
Mr. MacKinnon was next called
for. He assured the football men
that the students were with them
heart and soul and that they had
come to tell them so.
Mr. Filcher spoke a few words on
behalf of the Band, urging the stu
dents to do their part by helping the
members of this organization to
pay the expenses they had incurred
to make their appearance at the
game a success. Collectors were
appointed to receive contributions
at the door, and about four dollars
was,taken in.
The meeting then adjourned and
those present filed out to the tune
of "El Capitan" by the Band.
After the meeting the Band
marched around the lighted arcade
several times, followed by the still
enthusiastic crowd. And so the
enthusiasm did not soon spend it
self, but trickled out far into the
night with an occasional cheer here
and there throughout the neighbor
hood.
