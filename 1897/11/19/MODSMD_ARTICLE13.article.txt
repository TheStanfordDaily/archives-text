The patriotism of the membeis
of the Band and of the Ulee Club
in consenting to help out in mak
ing last night's meeting a success
should not go unnoticed and unre
warded. There are many ways in
which the students can show that
they appreciate the efforts of these
men. One way is to attend the
concerts of the musical clubs.
Another is to contribute to the
fund to secure suitable uniforms
for the men who have already sac
rificed both time and money to
give Stanford a Thanksgiving
Band of which we may be proud.
