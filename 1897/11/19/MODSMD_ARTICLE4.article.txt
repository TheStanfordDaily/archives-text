# THE
						TEAM DEPARTS.
## Amid the Cheers of Loyal Friends the Players Start for the Hills. 
### 
Two bus-loads of husky football
players left this morning for Con
gress Springs where secret practice
will be held for the remaining few
days before the big game. Accord
ing to the established custom, the
quad was the scene of the last burst
of enthusiasm which the team will
see before it appears on the field
next Thursday. The players were
accompanied by Coach Brooke,
Manager Switzer, "Billy" Harrel
son, "Tommy" Code, and "Phat"
Downing, who will assist in the
coaching.
Following is a list of the players
who went: Cotton, Fickert, Burnett,
Rice, Thomas, Jeffs, Parker, R.
Smith, Murphy, Daly, Fisher, Big
low, Ballantyne, C. Dole, A. Dole,
Rusk, James, Erb, Jost, Leavitt,
Hill, Woodruff, Adams, P. Smith,
and Wardall.
Just before this paper went to
press word was received from Man
ager Switzer that the team was
hard at work on its first practice.
The men are thoroughly satisfied
with the location, and great enthus
iasm prevails. Carle is not yet
with the team, but expects to be
there by tomorrow. Rea Smith is
feeling much better and his knees
are both much improved. There
will be practice twice a dayâ€”signal
practice in the morning and regu
lar work in the afternoon. "Billy"
McLeod is taking care of the in
dividual men and hopes to have
them in fine condition on Thanks
giving day.
