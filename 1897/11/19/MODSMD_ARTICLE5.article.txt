# Freshman Meetings.
## 
### 
The Class of 1901 met in room 50
at 1:30 Wednesday. There being
considerable dissatisfaction with the
class colors adopted, a committee
of two was appointed to act with
the president in adopting new
colors. December 10 was selected
as the date for the Freshman Glee.
The action in regard to sweaters
was reconsidered and it was de
cided to have cardinal sweaters
with white numerals on the breast.
The freshmen succeeded after
considerable trouble in getting
twenty-eight members (three more
than a quorum) together in the
chapel this afternoon to hold a
meeting. The date for holding the
Freshman Glee was changed from
December 10 to December 8. The
president was instructed to appoint
a committee on arrangements for
the Glee immediately.
