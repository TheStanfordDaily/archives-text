# The 						Sale of Tickets.
## 
### 
A long impatient line of football
enthusiasts was strung out from
the postoffice this afternoon when
the sale of tickets commenced.
The sale was advertised to begin
at 1:30 and as no seats were to be
reserved in advance anxious buy
ers were on hand as early as ten
o'clock. They were stickers, too,
for there they stayed, being relieved
only for the opportunity of taking
a hurried luncheon. It was
nearly two o'clock when the first
bidder threw down his shining
twenties and called for fifty tickets.
Thus it went on, some taking more,
some less, until they were all sold

and the pile of gold and silver on
the counter had swollen to $1,500.
Tickets for the Thanksgiving
show were on sale at the same
time and at four o'clock this after
noon over four hundred had been
disposed of.
The sale of tickets for the game
and show will be resumed on Mon
day at 1:30 p.m.
