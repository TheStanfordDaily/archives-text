IT STANDS TO REASON
that you will be more pleased
with a suit when you have selected
the pattern, had it made for you, and
know that you look well in it. A
great many men do themselves in
justice by wearing clothes that do
not become them.
We ask you to come examine our
exclusive, handsome patterns. We
will tell you who we are making
clothes for, and you will find the best
dressed men in town in that list.
