# AT CONGRESS SPRINGS.
## With the Exception of Murphy the Football Men Are in Fine Condition. 
### 
Sunday was a quiet day for the
football men at Congress Springs.
After a short walk and a hearty
breakfast the whole company, not
even excepting "Jack" Rice, went
to church. The men are all in fine
fettle and their healthy condition
is shown by the jolly and hearty
spirt which pervades the atmos
phere.
The practices are faster and the
work of the hacks is improving
Fisher, especially, is showing great
form. "Jack" Rice and Rea Smith
are both still out of the gameon ac
count of their knees, but both are
expected to be around all right by
Thursday. Hill is another unfor
tunate, having severely sprained
his ankle so that he will hardly
have time to recover. Captain
Cotton also is having trouble with
his ankle, but there is no serious
difficulty with it. The greatest
misfortune which has happened to
the team is in Murphy's attack of
poison-oak. His left arm it affected
and it is feared that the trouble
will spread.
The second team comes down
this afternoon and oidy the Varsity
and the substitutes wilJ remain at
the Springs until Wednesday, when
they will drive to San Jose and
spend the night. No changes have
taken place in the Varsity. Jeffs
and Parker are playing the ends,
while James is still at tackle.

Owing to the anxiety about col
lege concerning Murphy's condi
tion, a Inter report from the
Springs stated that he would he
able to phiy without doubt.
I\ Smith, Ballantyne, A. Dole, and
Woodruff returned this afternoon.
