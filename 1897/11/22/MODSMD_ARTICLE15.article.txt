We wish to call attention to the
notice in another column of the
prize sketch contest arranged for
by the committee in charge of this
semester's special editior. This
edition will be widely circulated.
It will include matter of consid
erable variety; but as the character
sketch will be the only purely lit
erary feature, the management is
anxious that as many as can
should contribute, so that it may
have a wide range of choice. All
hope that the sketch finally chosen
will be representative of our best
talent.
