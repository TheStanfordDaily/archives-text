Tomorrow night the regular
Tuesday evening lecture will be
given upon a subject in which
Stanford students would do well to
take more interest than the}'
do â€”the subject of art. Of course
there is considerable pressure in
the work of many students this
week, and those who are not suffer
ing under heavy pressure are ex
cited over our football prospects,
but to all of them an evening
spent in the diversion of an enter
taining lecture on a subject foreign
to their every-day work would
come as a relief and a pleasure.
