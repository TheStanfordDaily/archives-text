There has been general and loud
voiced complaint because of the
failure to set a limit on the num
ber of tickets to the game which
could be procured by one person in
the sale last Friday. It was cer
tainly a mistake to leave the way
open for those first in the line to
secure a monopoly of the seats in
the yelling section, but because the
way was left open does not in the
least justify those who took advan
tage of it. Those persons who
grasped this opportunity to specu
late in tickets deserve the severest
censure. The man who gets into
a line a few minutes before some
one else has no right to charge his
fellow students for his shrewdness,
lie is rendering no service to any

body. lie is really guilty of steal
ing the money of those behind him
in the line who would gel tickets at
the regular price if bis "hoggish
ness" did not exhaust the supply
and Ciinse them to pay him a profit
for bis insolence. These selfish in
dividuals would fora paltry gain
to themselves turn over the yelling
sections to outsiders and disinte
grate the forces of the rooters upon
which we depend so much for our
success. The man who will thus
betray bis ahna mater should be
ashamed to show bis face and offer
to sell bis tickets at an advanced
price. If be lias no sense of shame
left, the sentiment of the students
should be such that lie would be
afraid to show his bead.
