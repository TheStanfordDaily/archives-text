Thkkk are a great many persons
here who have never been even
half-way up the mountains which
lie between the University and the
ocean, and who know very little of
the beauties of this valley as viewed
from the foothills. Few people
like to explore the country alone,
and the reason that so many are
content to remain in ignorance of
their surroundings is doubtless due
to lack of company in such expedi
tions. It was to supply this lack
that the Stanford Outing Club was
formed. At the meeting of tbnt
club tomorrow arrangements will
be made fÂ«>r a trip during the
Thanksgiving recess. All who are
interested should attend the meet
ing and join the party when it is
formed.
