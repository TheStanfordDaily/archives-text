The Stanford Show to he given at
the Bush Street Theatre on Thanks
giving night will not only he a
novel one in many respects, but
will be an exceedingly good one.
Such features as the ballet, which
has been a part of the regular per
formance for several years, will be

discarded, and the entertainment
will consist of a farce, a footbu
love story, interspersed with sor.u
and specialties. There will he topi
cal songs by Geo. Bush, new selec
tions by the Glee and Mand lin
Clubs, new songs and dances bv
the "Brothers Hobo," and one of
the strongest attractions will be
Senorita "Pala Alta," of the Gaiety
Theatre, Paris, who will appear in
dances of her native land. Of
those who take part in the farce,
Riley and Rosborough, in the parts
of the duenna and frivolous young
lady, are said to be exceptionally
clever. The performance will
bristle with local hits, and all the
musical selections will be new.
