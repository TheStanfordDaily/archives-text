# The 						Thanksgiving "Sequoia."
## 
### 
The next number of the Sequoia
will appear Wednesday and will he
a football issue above all. Two
stories, "Two Touch-downs and a
Convert," by John M. Oskison, and
"Football on the Styx," by Bris
tow Adams, will be special features.
In verse the game has received
strong, earnest treatment in"The
Game" by Dane Coolidge, and
"From the Side-Dines," by Bristow
Adams. The regular departments
will be replete with football matter.
Wallace Irwin contributes a strong
character sketch, "A Spectre at the
Ferry."
