# Thanksgiving Service.
## 
### 
The numbers who were turned
away from the chapel yesterday un
able to get even standing room em
phasized our immediate need of a
larger assembly room. The chapel
was very tastefully decorated inside,
and it has been remarked by many
who were present that the musical
program which was presented would
create a sensation if it were given
in any church. Especially good
was the rendering of Marston's
Beloved, Now Are We the Sons of
God." This sentiment was the basis
of Dr. Thoburn's short Thanksgiv
ing talk to the students.
After the hymn"Holy,Holy,Holy"
by the congregation, and a prayer,
the choir under Mr. Hyde's leader
ship gav«3 Mendelssohn's "Praise to
the Father." Solos were sung by
Dr. Little, Miss Jagger, Miss Little,
and Professor Campbell. Dr. Little
and Miss Little also sang a duet,
and Professor Murray read a poem.
Mr. F. L. Dulley rendered a vio

lin solo. The service was closed
by the singing of "America" by the
congregation and the benediction
by Rev. Brown of I'alo Alto.
A special Thanksgiving offering
was taken up, a little over twenty
three dollars being received.
