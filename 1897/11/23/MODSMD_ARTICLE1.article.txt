# ALL WELL AT THE SPRINGS.
## Most of the Men in Fine Condition for Thursday's Contest. 
### 
Manager Switzer was interviewed
over the telephone late this after-1
noon by a member of the Daily j
Palo Alto staff and said that every
thing was all right at the Springs.
Murphy's attack of poison-oak has
not spread and no further danger
is anticipated from that source.
His arm is swollen but not bad
enough to keep him out of the
game on Thanksgiving day. It
has, however, robbed him of much
good practice since he has been at
the Springs. During the time when
he would have been praticing sig
nals with the team he has been
compelled to watch it on the side
lines, and he has not been able to
devote much time towards perfect
ing his kicking of field-goals and
making place kicks. His enforced
idleness may tend to make him less
sure on the day of the game.
Captain Cotton's ankle, which
he wrenched in signal practice the
other day, is troubling him consid
erably, the wrench having proved
to be more severe than was at first
anticipated. He is resting now
and his ankle will probably be all
right by Thursday. Hill is also
laid up with a sprained ankle, and
will probably not be able to play
again this season.
This morning and afternoon the
team practiced signals. There has
been no change in the line-up,
which was virtually fixed before
the teams left for the hills. Daly
maintains his place on the Varsity
squad. Dole gave him a hard race
and, had he come out earlier in
the season, he would undoubtedly
have been placed on the Varsity
squad. Unless the coach and cap
tain in the consultation after this
afternoon's signal practice change
their minds Daly will play left
halfback, changing over to right on
the defensive.
Jeffs and Parker will be the ends.
Jeffs has also been playing quarter
while Murphy has been laid off.
Thomas and Rice will play the
tackle positions. Rice has not
been playing at the Springs on ac
count of his knee, and every effort
has been made to get him in shape
for the game. He will be in fair
condition by Thursday. Thomas
is in good condition for the battle
for which he and Simpson are
booked on Thursday. Carle,
Burnett, and Fickert are in fine
condition and will play the game
for which they are so well fitted.
Fisher has recovered from the state
ness which affected his play dur
ing the week after the Reliance game
and has now attained his Varsity
form.
It is unfortunate that the two
stars back of the line, Cotton and
Murphy, have both been unable to
practice with the team during the
last few days. Stanford enthusiasts
will have to be content with the
assurance that both men will play
in the game, and that both men
will be in fair condition.
'•Billy" McLeod has worked hard
and the fine condition of the team '
is due to his conscientious work.;
He has done much to bring back!
into condition the men injured by
accident. The members of the sec

ond team, AVoodruff. I'. Smith,
Ballantyne, Wardall, Alfred Dote,
and "Billy" Erb, who returned last
evening, gave hopeful reports of the
condition of the men, and of Hit
way the men were playing. The
crisp mountain air has infused new
life and ginger into the team, which
011 its departure was fairly on the
road to growing stale.
The men who have been retained
as substitutes are R. Smith and
Leavitt, ends; Rusk and James,
tackles; Adams, guard; Biglow,
center; C. Dole and Jost, halves;
and Hill, fullback. Smith is still
bothered by his knee, but is pre
pared to go into the game and play
for all that is in him in case he is
needed. Leavitt is in good trim.
Rusk and James have shown up
well. Dole has played a star game
at half.
The team leaves Congress Springs
tomorrow afternoon and will stay
over night at the Vendome Hotel,
San Jose. The men will take the
flyer for the city, arriving about
11 o'clock, and will be driven to the
Pleasanton Hotel, where after a
light lunch they will dress for the
game, going to the field at 2
o'clock. Then the "rush, the
scrimmage, the tackle, and the
roll."
