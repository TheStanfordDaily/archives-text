'1 b<- following letter, dated No
vember 17, was received by the
president of the student body this
afternoon:
To the Student Body and Foot
ball Team:
The Stanford Club in New York
City has not forgotten that it is
customary the night before the big
game to give the team a final send
off. At that time, we wish to extend
to the student body, the manage
ment, and the team our heartiest
expressions of support and encour
agement. We wish we could be
present to encourage the team by
joining in the yells and songs, but
as this is impossible we leave it for
the student body to do it for us.
Whenever you yell on Thanksgiv
ing day remember us and put in
a little extra vim as our share.
To the team we can say that we
have eagerly watched the reports
of their work ai d the reports of the
sev rai games. We confidently
predict a victory. We number
among us here some of the old foot
ball heroes; men whom Berkeley
has never defeated. We send you
the example of Cochran, "Heff"
Williams, Spaulding, and "Jack"
Reynolds. At the close of the
game, may you be classed with
them and the other Stanford men
who have never suffered defeat at
Berkeley's hands. We leave the
glorious record of Stanford football
to you. See to it that you do not
spoil it. You have our best sup
port and heartiest encouragement.
We hope and expect to feel again
that thrill of joy we felt last year
when we read, "Stanford beat Cal
ifornia. Score 20-0."
Trusting that everything may
combine to make it a pleasant and
successful day for you all, 1 remain,
Yours enthusiastically,
C. H. Labbk,
Sec. Stanford Club N. Y. City.
