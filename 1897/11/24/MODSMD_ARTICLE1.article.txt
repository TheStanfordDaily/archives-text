Just one hour behind the Berke
ley team, our Varsity passed
through Palo Alto on its way to
San Mateo where tonight will be
spent. Every man with the excep
tion of Murphy, is in the pink of
condition. Cotton's ankle is in
poor shape but he will be able to
play the game " for a while at
least," as he said. Carle has been
practising at fullback and in case
Cotton finds it impossible to finish
the game, will probably take his
place.
The men will arrive in the city
tomorrow at eleven and will stop
at the Pleasanton, arriving at the
grounds at two.
The excursion train will leave
the campus tsmorrow at 8:80. The
gates at the grounds will be open
at eleven.
The last Varsity practice was
held yesterday, just enough to
limber the men up. The team as
announced officially will be: Center,
Burnett; right guard, Carle; left
guard, Fickert; right tackle,
Thomas; left tackle, Rice; rightend,
Parker; left end, Jeffs; quarter,

half, Daly; fullback, Cotton.
Harrelson, '95, the former quar
ter of the '94 team, and Downing,
'95, ex-center, have been helping
Coach Brooke to put the finishing
touches on the men. '"Billy" Mc-
Leod has all the men in good form.
"Jack" Rice and Rea Smith have
not been practicing lately on ac
count of their poor condition, but

disappearing.
