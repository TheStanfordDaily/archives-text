The great game will be played
tomorrow, and twenty-four hours
hence wherever a cardinal ribbon
is displayed there will be found
excessive joy or deepest gloom.
We have neither the power nor de
sire to hold ba'ck any one in the
celebration of our victory, if we win
one, but there is a certain class of
students who take tiie opportunity
of the evening after the foot
ball game to disgrace themselves
These people go to the city to
"celebrate" if we win and to
"drown their sorrow" if we lose.
It is not, however, from such im n
as these'that the greatest disendn
is reflected on the University Jt
is from the mob of "sports" who
"play" either one of the two uni
versities and celebrate on their
winnings. It was this sort of San
Franciscan which cast so much dis
credit on both universities one
Thanksgiving day a year or so ago,
until the professors took it upon
themselves to strip our colors from
these hoodlums. We hope that
our students will see to it that the
colors are pulled off every drunkard
on Thanksgiving night, who seeks
by this means to pose its a student
and make one or the other of the
universities responsible for his
actions.
