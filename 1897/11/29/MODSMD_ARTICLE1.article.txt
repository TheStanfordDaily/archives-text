## Stanford Triumphs a Fourth Time Over the U.C. Forces. The 						Varsity of 1897 Runs Up the Largest Score Ever Made Against a Berkeley Team. 
### 
Recreation Park was jammed.
Never before in the history of foot
hall on the Pacific Coast has such
an immense crowd assembled to
witness the annual intercollegiate
game as that which for nearly
three solid hours slowly tiled into
the grounds at Eighth and Harri
son streets.
Three sides of the field were
ablaze with color, while over the
west-end fence houses were black
with those whose pocket-books could
not afford a respectable seat.
Blue and gold predominated as
it usually does on such occasions,
but the U. 0. enthusiasts were given
verv few opportunities of display
ing their colors. Hall's brilliant
runs alone gave a chance for the
blue and gold to show its glitter in
the sun's rays. The Berkeley sec
tions were cool and chilly.
The first great outburst of en
thusiasm was caused by the ar
rival on the field of the University
Band, resplendent in their new
sweaters. The men presented a
tine appearance,and during the en
tire day reflected great credit upon
themselves and the University.
Hardly had they become seated
when the vvnole California section
burst into a blaze of blue and gold
as their team trotted on the field
and went through some signals.
Our men were not far behind, and
soon they also appeared upon the
field near the training quarters,
giving opportunity for the Stanford
section to give vent to some of its
enthusiasm.
The preliminary practice was
soon, over and Stanford having won
the toss, Captain Cotton chose the
west goal.
Ludlow kicked a swift low ball,
but it went in touch and was
brought back. The next time it
went to Murphy and back it sailed
into U. C.'s territory fifteen yards
from the center of the field. Play
now commenced in earnest, and
Berkeley tried the strength of our
line and found it as solid as a stone
wall. Stanford took the ball on
downs and back went the guards
on that wonderful play of Pennsyl
vania's. Not once did Stanford
lose the ball and Cotton went over
for the first touch-down of '97 in
just six minutes and ten seconds.
Murphy kicked the goal, thereby
giving the Stanford men another
opportunity to split their throats.
Fisher made a beautiful run-in
of Ludlow's second kick-off and
Murphy immediately punted to
Hall, who made five before being
downed. California soon lost the
ball on downs and again our men
ran it over, the monotony of line
bucking being relieved by pretty
runs by Jeffs and Carle. Murphy
again added two points to the fast
increasing score.
It was now evident that the

guards-back play could not be
stopped, while our line seemed
capable of holding whenever neces
sary. The Stanford rooters were
almost too happy to yell and
Brooke remarked as he shifted his
position for the first time since the
beginning of the play that "it was
all over but the shouting." Mur
phy's return of Ludlow's kick-off
was short and Hall gained five
yards on the run-in. Twice was
Stanford penalized for off-side play
and the ball was carried to within
four feet of the goal line. But the
cardinal lads stood firm as rock

and on as pretty an exhibition of
defense as a Stanford man could
wish to see, took the ball on downs.
Murphy punted out of danger and
the Varsity soon succeeded in get
ting the ball on downs and run
ning it over for another touch-down,
from which Murphy failed to kick
a goal. Captain Hall of California
made two great runs during the
remainder of the half, being
downed in great style by Murphy.
No further score was made and the
ball rested in U. C.'s possession on
Stanford's thirty-yard line when
time was called.

Carle's only kick-off in the sec
ond half went fifty-two yards and
Hall ran in fifteen before Parker
downed him.
The ball came no closer than onr
fifteen-yard line during the entire
second half. Daly and Cotton
each succeeded in taking the ball
across the line. Murphy, besides
kicking two more goals, got in one
of those long runs which had been
looked for, while Cotton plunged
through the line in the "same old
way."
With but a few seconds more to
play, the covering of one of the
grandstands fell in and the game
was called with the ball in our
possession on our own fifteen-yard
line.
Score, 28-0. Touchdowns —Stan-
ford, 5: by Cotton, 3; by Fickert, 1;
by Daly, 1. Goals kicked —by
Murphy, 4 out of 5. Referee,

Club. Linesmen, Harrelson, '95,
and Hunt, U. C. '94.
The whole team played with
that snap and dash which char
acterized the Reliance team two
weeks before. Every man was a
host in himself and no single one
could be pointed out as a star.
Burnett at center showed great
form and rivaled the ends in getting
down the field.
Carle, Fickert, Thomas, and Rice
outplayed their men and in every
way were equal to their duties.
Parker, Jeffs, and Smith, on the
ends, also out-classed their oppon
ents.
Behind the line, Fisher, who
changed sides with Daly on defense,
put up a magnificent game, par
ticularly on the defensive.
It was Daly's first game but he
proved himself thoroughly reliable
and gained many yards for the
team.
Murphy, although greatly handi
capped by a badly swollen arm,
played his usually brilliant game.
Cotton, by a repetition of last
year's performance, proved beyond
a doubt that he is the greatest line
bucker on the Coast.
Behind the line California was
especially weak. Captain Hall
was the only one on the whole
team who played first-class ball.
His great running stamps him as
a worthy successor to Ransome, the
great captain of last year's team.
To no one man does Stanford
owe as much for the great victory
as to Coach Brooke. His work
with the team was systematic from
the very beginning. He had a
given team with which to work;
certain positions were weak while
others were strong; and by utiliz
ing that which was strongest in our
team, the great center trio, he
enabled us to bring back the great
est score which Stanford has yet
won.
Coach Brooke left for Philadel
phia Saturday evening and was
escorted to the train by a party of
his "war-dogs" as he affectionately
called his 28-0 team. The Stan
ford yell and the "Hurrah for
Brooke" yell were given by the
men as their farewell adieux.
