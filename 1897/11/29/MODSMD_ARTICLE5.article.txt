The great annual football con
test is now a thing of the past.
Stanford's supremacy on the grid
iron is settled for another year at
least. We should now turn our at
tention to other intercollegiate con
tests, in which we should make
every effort this year to win. The
two debates, baseball, and track
athletics offer Berkeley abundant
opportunity to make up for her de
feat last Thursday. The Carnot
Debate comes next. We shall hold
our preliminaries this week. Let
Stanford enthusiasm still spur our
contestants on to victory.
