The great Thanksgiving game
has been won and lost, and the ef
forts of Captain Cotton and his
team were rewarded by the greattst
score in Stanford's football hi.-tory.
The football season which has just
closed was marked by ups and
downs, and its successful termina
tion is a proof of the loyalty and
earnestness with which our team
worked for victory. Stanford men
and the Stanford Varsity can take
just pride in a victory which was
not won by a " fluke " or by what
people term " Stanford luck but
by "good, hard, clean football."
The team had the science of the
game and the pluck and determi
nation necessary for football, and
back of all that Stanford's winning
tradition.
The student body has received
the thanks of both the coach and
the Varsity for the support they
have received. The thanks of the en
tire student body are due to the team
for the gallant victory they have
won for Stanford; and to the coach
for his careful and conscientious
fulfillment of his duties. The
second eleven, who helped to win
the victory, are by no means last
in the list of those to whom honor

is due. The second eleven consti-J
tutes a reserve force upon which
we shall draw for our future vic
tories, as well as the source from i
which our past victories have come.
All praise to the second team !
