# THANKSGIVING SHOW.
## W. H. Irwin's Farce, "The Conversion of Uncle," Given to a Crowded House. 
### 
After the game the Stanford
forces drifted to the Bush Street
Theatre where the musical and
dramatic talent of the University
were to display their ability in the
annual Thanksgiving night show.
The remodeled '98 Junior Farce
of \V. H. Irwin's, entitled "The
Conversion of Uncle," was the
piece of the evening, and the
specialties, and numbers by the
musical clubs were worked in very
neatly.
The first scene,"A feed in Encina,"
was very realistic, and the actors
seemed very much at home in tlieir
parts. There were plenty of local
hits, and the act was full of local
color. Even the familiar figure of
the venerable "Santa Chi us" con
tributed to the merriment of the
evening.
Joe Rosborough as Mabel Mars
den wore a stunning yellow cos
tume and played his part with all
the grace imaginable. His only
handicap was his deep bass voice,
which he controlled very well.
Frank Riley as Mrs. Gwendolyn
Kernald matched Mr. Tubbs very
well as to stature and was in every
way an admirable chaperone to
Miss Mabel, and personally a very
charming widow. Walter Mcin
tosh as the Hon. Jason Tubbs made
the hit of the evening in the mas
culine parts, lie was irresistably
funny, and brought out all the pos
sibilities of the character which
Mr. Irwin had created. J. S. Bris
coe as Rupert Marsden was some
what over.-hadowed by his sister
Mabel, but nevertheless made a hit
as a type of a much-rushed Stan
ford freshman. Harry Deuel as
.James Keats Poole, the Sequoia
bardlet, was second only to Mr.
Mcintosh, and demonstrated the
dangers of too much digging and
verse-writing. His scenes with
Mcintosh furnished the humor of
the evening. George Francis as
Harry Hunter had a versatile part
to play, serving as a waiter and
taking the part of a lover and of a
Varsity hero. He even kicked a
goal at the finale when Miss Mabel
asked him, after admitting that he
had scored, if he did not wish to
try for goal. \V. C. McNeil as "A
Berkeley Hoodoo," the little Cali
fornia bear, sang a touching ballad
of defeat.
During the intermissions a
vaudeville program was rendered
in which the Glee and Mandolin
Clubs took part. The Mandolin
Club did creditably enough, but
the (ilee Club was weak, either
on account of the thinness of its
ranks or from lack of training. At
any rate the club did not come up
to its three previous performances.
"Anglaise Oncie" Wright was
amusing in his dans du diahle, but
the hit of the vaudeville was made
by Harry Deuel and Claire Strohn
in their sketch the "Brothers Hobo."
Their make-up was killing and
their clog-dancing clever.
W. 11. Irwin was stage manager
and the show went off very
smoothly except in a few places.
The Stanford Orchestra, under F. A.
Corbusier as leader, played some

very good music. The show as a
whole was the best ever given by a
Stanford company since the custom
of giving Thanksgiving night en
tertainments, was introduced, and
the entire performance reflected
great credit both upon the per
formers and the managers.
The financial returns are not yet
complete but the student body will
realize in the neighborhood of $500.
livery seat in the house was sold,
and the audience was very appre
ciative.
