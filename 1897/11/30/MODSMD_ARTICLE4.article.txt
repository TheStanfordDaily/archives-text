# The
						Thanksgiving Day Accident.
## 
### 
In so far as can be ascertained
the blame for the unfortunate acci
dent at the Thanksgiving game was
due largely to the inefficiency of
the police.
Mr. Weir, the contractor on the
day after the game made the fol
lowing statement to a representa
tive of the Daily Palo Alto. He
said: "In the first place the grand
stands were strong and safe. The
inspector of the Fire Department
for that district, Mr. Fernandez,
examined them and officially pro
nounced them perfectly secure.
The boards which were placed over
some of the grandstands were there
merely to shed the water in case of
necessity, and were not intended
to be used as seats for spectators.
Owing to the negligence of the
police, a large number of boys
climbed over the Harrison street
fence onto the roof. During the
excitement of the game about
twenty collected in one spot, caus
ing some boards to fall and others
to hang down." Mr. Weir also
positively asserted that "the acci
dent was in no way the fault of the
managers."
Stanhope, '98, who was one of
the ushers in an adjoining section,
states that neither his section nor

the section in which the accident
occurred were overcrowded; that
he warned the police of the danger
and they failed to do anything
about the matter. Those who were
| 011 the roof were composed entirely
of persons having no tickets. The
board which was hud against the
fence, by means of which the boys
got on the roof, was removed sev
eral times by a policeman on the
outside but as soon as his back
was turned it would be replaced
and the boys would scramble on
the roof.
Besides those police who were
detailed by Chief Lees there were
twenty-five special officers on the
grounds from Harry Morse's de
! tective agency.
