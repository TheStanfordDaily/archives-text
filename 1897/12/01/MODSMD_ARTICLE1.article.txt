# MUSICAL CLUBS' TOUR.
## Arrangements for the Christmas Trip South Are Almost Complete. 
### 
Arrangements are nearing com
pletion for the holiday tour of the
Glee and Mandolin Clubs through
the southern part of the State. The
clubs will leave on the twenty-sec
ond of the month and occupy the
whole of the vacation with their
trip. They will go south as far as
San Diego, where a concert will be
given. Going down on the east of
the mountains they will return on
the other side. In all sixteen con
certs will be given, the places be
ing selected from the following list
of towns: Santa Cruz, Salinas,
llollister, Monterey, San Luis
Obispo, Santa Barbara, Los An
geles, Pasadena, Riverside, Red
lands, San Bernardino, Santa Ana,
San Diego, Bakerstield, Fresno, Vi
salia, Pomona, Modesto, Merced,
and Stockton. F. W. Morrison,
'96, has been selected as advance
agent, and if his appointment is
approved by the Executive Commit
tee which meets tonight, will prob
ably start South tomorrow. Morri
son is a good business man and has
had more experience in conduct
ing college business enterprises
than any other man available. He
was business manager of the Daily
Palo Alto two years ago and last
year accompanied the club√ü North
in his capacity as treasurer of the
student body. He is thoroughly
conversant with all the details of
the business and his previous ex
perience with theatrical people as
well as with theatrical contracts
give promise that the financial re
sults of the trip will be more satis
factory lhan those of the last Sout
hern tour. The trip will be well ad
vertised and already much interest
has been aroused in the South.
This assurance is strengthened
by the quality of the work of both
clubs this year. The Glee Club
has been materially strengthened
in all parts by members of the
Freshman Class and the leader, C.
Ysin H. King, '99, has succeeded
remarkably well in tilling the large
place left vacant by Kaufman, '97.
The Mandolin Club under the
leadership of E. C. Sewall, '98, has
become probably the strongest that
ever represented the University.
The Glee Club has secured the
services of Prof. Morris, director of
the Loring Club of San Francisco,
who will be with them two nights
a week until Christmas.
Good advertising matter has
been gotten out and several good
contracts are under consideration,
the only one definitely concluded
being that at Los Angeles. The
clubs will appear there on the
thirtieth or thirty-first.
The following men are now
practicing in the clubs from which
twenty fouror twenty-five men will
be selected in the course of the
week to take the trip, of whom four
or five will be members of both
clubs:
