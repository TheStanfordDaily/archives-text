Altijough we have won the first
two intercollegiate athletic contests
of the year, we should not allow a
feeling of self-sufficiency or indif
ference to prevent us from making
a hard fight for the spring events
on track and diamond. The
leadership in both these sports is
the best, and the work of both
captains, who are of our most con
scientious athletes, should inspire
hard work on the part of aspirants
for positions on the teams. Too
much stress can not be placed upon
the value of fall training for spring
contests. Let every man who can
play ball or do anything in the
track or field events turn out and
do what he can for the University.
