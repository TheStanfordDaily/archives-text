Junior classmen have been re
peatedly warned that their Annual
is at a standstill for want of funds.
I'p to date no more than nine out
of a elaoS of nearly a hundred and
fifty have paid the assessment
levied several months ago. The
warning that has been given out
is authoritative and is not to be
treated lightly. When University
men and women have attained the
dignity of upperclassmen they
ought, at least, to have that kind
of class interest which leads to
energetic suppport and class
triumph. If the Annual Board
goes ahead with the publication
there will be a debt staring the
class in the face upon its issue.
The faculty always compels the
payment of such obligations and it
is better to start well than to end
disgracefully. The editor and busi
ness manager can not issue a book
without some aid in starting it. It
seems that the debts arising from
the issue of annuals heretofore have
not been caused so much by the
managerial and editorial depart
ments as through the negligence of
the classmen themselves. The
Juniors must wake up and save
the money to pay their dues. Class
spirit is expressed in more ways
than one. We would suggest a
meeting of the class to be worked
up for the presentation of this
matter. In the meantime, pay
your '99 assessments.
