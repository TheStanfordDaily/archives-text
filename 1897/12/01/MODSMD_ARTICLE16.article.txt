Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Last year when Mr. Hulme was
criticized by "Philistine" for the
manner in which the Sequoia was
conducted, he said in one of his re
plies: "We have the Daily Palo
Alto for news and Josh for vulgar
ity." Whatever may have been
the merits or demerits of the
Sequoia under Mr. Hulme's editor
ship, it was at least free from any
show of vulgarity. So much, cer
tainly, can not be said for the
Sequoia this year. A recent article
in that paper is little short of dis
gusting, and for one 1 desire to
enter a vigorous protest against
having one of the student publica
tions pander to the tastes of Pan
Dora or of others whose delight is
in vitiated realism.
A Student.
