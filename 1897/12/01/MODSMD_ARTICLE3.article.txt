# Football Prospects at U.C.
## 
### 
The U. C. football enthusiasts
are already wondering what the
score will be next year. The lead
ing article in yesterday's Califor
nian was headed "Football Pros
pects: Lots of Good Material Btill
Left in College." The article fol
lows:
"Naturally, after the overwhelm
ing defeat of last Thursday, the
question comes to the mind of the
enquiring student: What are our
prospects for next year?
"Stanford this year will lose the
majority of her players by gradu
ation, Fickert, Carle, Fisher, Cot
ton, Jeffs, Rice, and Thomas all
being seniors. It is rumored, how
ever, that Carle and Fisher will re
turn next year, the former to cap
tain the team.
"Of our own team only three men
will graduate this year, Haskell,
Mayer, and Hopper. This leaves
Hall, Simpson, I'ringle, Barnes,
Whipple, Cireisberg, Ludlow, and
McDermott to form a nucleus for
next year's team. With these men
forming a working basis, and with
the excellent second eleven which
we had this year, our football pros
pects are not so blue as the lop
sided score of last Thursday would
seem to indicate.
"On the other hand Stanford is
placed in the same position as we
were this year, forced to form a
comparatively new team."
