The first of the preliminaries for
the Carnot Debate will be held in
the chapel tomorrow night. All
who are interested in debating
should be present at that time to
encourage the contestants by their
presence. Our success in this con
test depends largely on the en
couragement given our representa
tives b)' the students and professors.
And we should bear in mind at all
times that athletic victories count
for very little unless they are
backed up by forensic victories also.
Not until we vanquish our oppon
ents in both lines can we rest con
tent with a victory in either.
