The Executive Committee in its
session last night empowered Track
Manager Gregory to secure the
services of a trainer for the team.
The manager is energetic in his
endeavors to make all conditions
as favorable for the men in train
ing as possible; he has had the
track in condition for use during
the last two months. Captain
Brunton has also been doing his
best to get men out and has given
to the new men the benefit of his
experience. It is known that the
student body as a whole is anxious
for our track team to cast its past
records to the winds and to take
those of our football teams as an
incentive to stronger efforts in the
future. All conditions are favor
able for men to get out and try for
the track team. There has always

been a cry from the track men that
they were not supported so enthus
iastically as the other teams are.
This year the student body is wait
ing for a chance to give the men
all the benefit of their support and
encouragement, but they can not
support or encourage men who do
not appear on the field. Nor will
all the efforts of trainer, captain,
and coach avail anything unless
more men come out. It lies largely
with the men who make the team
this year to decide what the result
of this year's lield-day shall be.
Nothing can be done without more
candidates for the team.
