# NEWS FROM THE TRACK.
## The
						Old Men Are Now Out Regularly But New Material is Much in Demand. 
### 
Most of the old track men are
practicing pretty regularly on the
track now. It is noticeable that
very few new men are getting out,
however. As the old men are get
ting into shape for next semester's
harder work, it is feared that when
the new men come out they will
become discouraged by their in
ability to stand the work which
the more experienced men in their
superior condition will be able to
do. To avert this, Captain Brun
ton is trying to get all men who in
tend to try for the team out im
mediately. Mr. Storey is helping
him by sending squads of his gym
nasium class upon the track three
times a week to jog distances. All
the men are running long distances
and very little sprinting is being
done.
All of the old men who have
been on the track this year give
promise that they will do as well
or better than they did last year.
Brunton's stride seems to be better
than it was last year, although so
far he has done no hard work.
Williams, who has been unfortu
nate in hurting his leg for the past
two years at just the wrong time, is
running very strongly again. He
has built up his legs and strength
ened his ankles during the vacation
and his stride is as good as ever.
Smith is training regularly.
Dane Coolidge is trying the dis
tances this year. Walker seems to
be in better shape than he was last
year. Daggett has not come out
yet. New men who will try for
the distances are Steele, '01, Pot
ter, '01, and Erb, '01. Chris. Brad
ley is thinking of trying for the
distances also.
Of the sprinters, Brunton, Birch,
Karsted, and Diggles, are all out
taking light work. Charlie Dole
has not been able to do much so
far. Boyd and Hopper are trying
for the jumps. Morgan was hurd
ling some for a time, but football
interrupted his track work. Foot
ball has been keeping most of the
weight men busy also, as well as
Paul Adams, the mile walker.
