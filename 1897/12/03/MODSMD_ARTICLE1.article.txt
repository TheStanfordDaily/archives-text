# THE 						JUNIOR ANNUAL.
## Work on the Class Book Can Not Proceed Until Assessments Are Paid. 
### 
The Board of Editors of the '99
Annual met yesterday at 5 p.m.
and discussed plans for next year's
publication. The meeting was en
thusiastic and from the spirit
shown by the members of the
board and the work already ac
complished the book is sure to be a
literary and artistic success.
The great stumbling block to the
success of the '99 Annual is in the
failure of the class to pay the as
sessment of $2.50 levied upon each
member. The publishers of the
Annual, warned by the experience
of former publishers of class an
nuals, have required a guarantee
deposit of $250 before they will pro
ceed with the work. Up to date no
more than twelve or thirteen as
sessments have been collected, and
the work is at a standstill.
The editors will have part of the
book ready for press by January 1,
1898, and unless the $250 is raised
by that time the publication of the
book will he seriously delayed. It
was intended that the volume
should appear by April 15, but in
order to accomplish that the
printers must lie kept busy from
the first of January.
This matter was brought up be
fore the board by Editor Bradley
and Manager Greenebaum. The
board decided to request the presi
dent of the class to call a meeting
in order to lay the matter before
the members.
Editor Bradley announced the
resignation of .1. H. Polhemus as
associate editor of the Quad on ac
count of the recent death of bis
father, which will render his ab
sence from college this year un
avoidable. E. W. Smith, '99, an
associate editor of the Daily Palo
Alto, was elected to fill the va
cancy.
The editors of the Annual desire
to announce that the competition
for the prize story and the prize
poem, for each of which ten dollars
lias been offered, will close Jan
uary 15. After that date no more
contributions will be received, and
the judges will select the winners
as soon as possible. Candidates
for either should confer with the
editor or one of the board.
