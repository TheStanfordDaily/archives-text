# An Open Letter.

### 
San Francisco, Nov. 30, 1897.
To the Faculty and Students of
Stanford University:
I take this means of publicly ex
pressing my thanks for the appre
ciative reception accorded my new
"University Note-Book" since its
introduction through the Stanford
University Bookstore.
Being so tardy in perfecting the
device for this year's business I
have been most agreeably sur
prised by its liberal sale at Stan
ford.
You may look to me, through
your Mr. Hyde, to supply and per
fectly guarantee any size or form
of binder of this model which your
work may require. Respectfully,
Edward \V. Hill, U. C. '90,
Inventor.
