Mr. Morrison is entering the
Southern field with lots of energy
and enthusiasm and is confident
that the trip will be a success. J1 e
is armed with press clippings and
articles descriptive of the clubs,
which will appear in the news
papers and prepare the people of
the South for the coming of the
clubs. Transportation arrange
ments have already been com
pleted with the Southern Pacific
officials. The advertising for the
trip will be first-class. One of the
features will be a poster in a very
attractive color design.
The clubs are practicing dili
gently and if they keep up their
present pace will be in good condi
tion by the close of the semester.
