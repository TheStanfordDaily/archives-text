Editor Daily Palo \lto:
Jll Wednesday's issue "A Stu
dent" scores 1 he Sequoia for vulgar
ity, vigorously protesting against
"delight in vitiated realism." We
believe that the purpose of the Se
quoia in publishing Pan Dora's
sketch is not to "pander" to any
tastes, but to excite an active dis
gust which will lead to student
body sentiment for reform.
"Pan Dora" strikes at a real
evil. Let "A Student" ride up
with a bus-load of drunken fellow
students, as did a young woman
after a holiday, to appreciate the
truthfulness of the "silhouette."
Two Students.
