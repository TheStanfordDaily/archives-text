Before introducing the speakers
Professor Starbuck gave a short
history of past Carnot medal con
tests and stated that the qualities
of spontaneity, excellence of rea
soning, scholarship, style, and de
livery would be considered by the
judges in choosing the team.
The first debate was on the ques
tion, "Resolved, That a Franco-
German alliance would be for the
best interests of France."
Mackay, '00, was the first con
testant and his speech for the af
firmative was clear and forceful
throughout.
Chandler, '99, though showing
slight nervousness, made a strong
reply to the arguments advanced
by the affirmative speaker.
Charles, '98, in reply for the af
firmative, delivered one of the
clearest and most logical speeches
of the evening.
The second subject of debate was,
"Resolved, That the attitude of
France toward Germany since the
defeat of 1870 has been detrimental
to the best interests of France."
Suzzallo, '00, opened for the af
firmative with the most spirited
speech of the evening.
Yost, '99, followed in an earnest
speech for the negative.
The argument of Quayle, '00, for
the affirmative was one of the most
thoughtful of the evening and
pointed out the direct economic loss
resulting to France from the atti
tude of enmity towards Germany.
Miller, '01, in closing for the neg
ative insisted on the patriotism
which results from the French
army service.
The first subject debated the sec
ond evening was, "Resolved, That
the colonial expansion of France
in Southeastern Asia is a mistaken
policy."
Hickok, '00, opened for the af
firmative and contended that the
question of mistake depended upon
the success of the policy.
Morgan, '98, in one of his char
acteristic speeches, maintained that
the question of mistake depended
on (he probable future results to
France, which he thought would
be advantageous.
The second debate was,"Resolved,
That France should choose the
friendship of England rather than
that of Russia."
Miss Strunsky, '00, led for the af
firmative.
The speech of Rothrock, '98, was
in the minds of the larger part of
the audience the strongest speech
of the evening
Oskison, '98, made a scholarly
speech for the affirmative. The
speeches as a whole showed much
interest and study on the part of
the contestants, and the audience
throughout the four debates were
extremely appreciative of good
points made.
The judges were out ten min

utes and announced as their choice
of speakers, Morgan, '98, Suzzallo,
'00, and Miss Strunsky, '00.
