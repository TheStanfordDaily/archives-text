The columns of the Daily Palo
Alto tire in theory supposed to be
open to any student who wishes to
express his opinion on any subject
connected with student life. But
in practice they are not. In theory
the editor of the paper is not re
sponsible for the sentiments voiced
in communications. Hut practi
cally he is responsible to the com
munity if he allows anything to
appear in print which would bet
ter be left unsaid. Those who
complain because we refuse to pub
lish what they want to say tire at
liberty to appeal to the student
body or to print their stuff on a
poster and distribute it to the Uni
versity public as best they can.
