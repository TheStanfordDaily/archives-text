# The
						Freshman Glee.
## 
### 
About eighty-five couples at
tended the Freshman C!lee last Fri
day evening, and the floor of the
gymnasium was just about large
enough to accommodate the crowd
comfortably. The freshmen were
conspicuous by their presence, and
they cast many a threatening glance
at the masked sophomores, many of
whom viewed the dancing from the
roof.
The affair was without doubt the
most largely attended and the best
freshman glee that has ever been
given here. The gymnasium pre
sented a very attractive appearance,
being profusely decorated with red
and white, the class colors.
The guests commenced to arrive
about eight o'clock, and it was
nearly nine when the orchestra
commenced the first waltz. The
program consisted of twelve num
bers with eight extras, and it was
after one o'clock when the gleeful
assembly dispersed.
By ten o'clock a large crowd of
sophomores had congregated about
the door, and a little later the elec
tric lights went out, someone hav
ing cut the wires in the clump of
trees near the football field. This
did not interfere with the dancing,
for lamps had been provided by
the management in anticipation of
such an exigency. However, the
pranks of the wily sophomores did
not end with this. A commotion
was caused by a large yellow dog
which was thrown through the
window with a tin can tied to his
hospitable tail.
Among the outsiders present were:
Miss Spivalo, of Belmont; Mrs.
Jones and Miss Jones, of Santa
Monica; the Misses Dunn, Pierce,
Ilore, Russel, Mills, and Campbell,
of San Francisco; Miss Lee, of Oak
land; Miss Silent, of Los Angeles;
and Miss Sheehan, of Sacramento.
