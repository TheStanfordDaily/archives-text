# SUNDAY SERMON.
## Dr. Elliot Gives a Suggestive Lecture on "The Larger Life." 
### 
"For whosoever will save his life
shall lose it; and whosoever will
lose his life for my sake shall find
it.''
This was Dr. Elliott's text in the
chapel yesterday morning. Some
of the things which he said con
cerning its application to student
life follow.
"This paradox of Jesus' was his
answer to the question, 'Is life
worth living?' it is an answer
which the world has found it hard
to accept. Its unconditional nega
tive is incomprehensible to the
passionate optimism of youth. Too
often its unconditional affirmative
is regarded as an interest-bearing
bond whereby for loss and absti
nence here there shall be stored up
abundant gain and indulgence
hereafter.
"There is one plane of living for
which no man will openly stand
sponsor —the life of self-indulgence,
the riot of passions in which the
strongest gather up the reins. But
the life of self may be lived on a
higher plane. Self-indulgence may
give place to self-control.
"But suppose life has no larger
meaning. Suppose these good
things stand somehow as the meas
ure of the value of life: if they are
lost, life will be lost. A brilliant
recitation, good manners, a judi
cious deference to the eccentricities
of his superiors, stand a man in good
stead. Work and play are ar
ranged with these reflections upper
most. He sees the vantage-ground
of oHice, of the management of
student enterprises. He calculates
the value of acquaintance, of pat
ronage, of combination in attaining
these things. His skill in arrang
ing combinations, his ability to
put other men under obligation,
finally land him in the top places
of college life. Out in the world
this experience, this acquaintance,
this college success, give him a
fairly clever idea of where the
chords of the larger success must be
struck. Such a man generally
succeeds. Is it not the ideal which
the college student may fairly hold
before him? Let us not lie too
hasty in controverting this opinion.
Some measure of success —some-
times the highest of its kind —
comes along this line. But the
pity of it is that success so often
satisfies.
"There are many who hear the
first part of Jesus' answer and lis
ten no further. Jesus did not em
phasize the losing but the folding.
"Some student once figured out
that in the whole United States
there was one college graduate to
every three thousand citizens. And
as it was near commencement
time he wrote a stirring editorial
for the college daily upon the mis
sion and responsibilities of those
who were about to graduate—each
to become the leader of three thou
sand! No, the college diploma
confers no leadership, and the three
thousand are recklessly indifferent
to it. But to be the servant of
three thousand! That is some
thing to stir the blood.
"What would it mean if this life

lilied our little college world? If
in all there were no uncharitable
ness, no triumphing over our neigh
bor but with him? If the Stan
ford name always stood for the
things that are honest, just, pure,
lovely, and of good report? And
if this larger life could be carried
into all the world? There would
be no more war and no more
prisons. There would never be
another lockout; there would never
be any more oppression. There
would never be printed another is
sue of 'yellow-journalism.' There
would be no double lives, "For
the earth would be filled with the
knowledge of the glory of the Lord,
as the waters cover the sea."
