The Oregon and Washington stu
dents are arranging fora Christmas

Pacific to Portland and the Puget
Sound points. A large number
have already signified their inten

attle, Tacoma, Spokane, as well as
the intermediate points between
San Francisco and Portland, will
be reached by the excursion, which
will probably leave on the evening
of December 22.
The rates at present are lower by
one-half than they were at this time
last year. Between Portland and
San Francisco the lirst-class rate is
$10.00; second class $5.00. The
rate to Tacoma is $15.00 first class,
and $10.00 second. The rates to
Seattle are the same as to Tacoma.
But the amount collected in every
case will be $10.00 greater on each
ticket whether first or second class.
This excess payment will be re
funded; rebate drafts will be fur
nished payable north-bound at
Portland, and south-bound at San
Francisco or Sacramento. All first
class rales include a berth in a
first-class Pullman sleeper between
San Francisco and Portland, and
the second-class rates berths in a
tourist sleeper. The excursion has
been placed in the hands of Mr. R.
A. Leiter, who with Mr. J. E. Mc-
Dowell at the Registrar's oflice, will
give further information regarding
the trip.
