# NEW VARSITY CAPTAIN.
## Forrest S. Fisher Selected to Lead the Football Men Next Year. 
### 
A large crowd of students col
lected in the corridors of Encina
Hall yesterday evening in anticipa
tion of the election of a football
captain for next year. A short
time after 7:30 the football men
went into the reception room off
the main hall, Fisher, '98, and
Thomas, '98, being last.
Captain Cotton simply asked if
there were any nominations for
football captain of next year's
Varsity football eleven. He had
hardly finished speaking when
Thomas, '98, nominated Forrest S.
Fisher, '98, and moved that the
election be made unanimous. The
students outside had formed in two
lines and the answering shout of
"Fisher" to Thomas' speech was
passed along the line. When the
door of the room was opened, the
men inside pushed Fisher out of
the door and into the arms of the
crowd. He was lifted to the
shoulders of a few upperclassmen
and carried to the lobby on the
second floor, where he spoke from
the table. In a few short, earnest
sentences he promised to captain
the team without favor and to give
every man who came out upon the
field a chance for the Varsity if he
had it in him.
Thomas was called upon fora
speech and he modestly told of his
candidacy for the captaincy of the
team and said that he"was beaten
out by a better man." Cotton,
Fickert, Burnett, Parker, Erb, Daly,
Scoville, and Irwin, '98, were
called for.
