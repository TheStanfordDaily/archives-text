# Scrub Team Defeats U. P.
## 
### 
Last Friday afternoon Beckett,
'00, who has been coaching the
football team of the University of
Pacific, succeeded in getting.eleven
men to consent to go to San Jose
Saturday to play the U. P. team a
practice game. An attempt was
made to get the regular second
eleven to go up, but failing in that,
anyone who had ever played foot
ball was asked, and finally a team
was secured picked from freshman,
sophomore, and second eleven men.
The game was called at 10 a.m.
and with no knowledge of signals
the team from Stanford went 011
the field without ever even having
played together before. It was
surely a case where Stanford grit
had to win, for nothing else could
be depended upon. The U. P.
team put up a very erratic game,
at times making it quite interest
ing for their opponents. The Stan

ford men were on the defensive
three fourths of the time, the U. P.
team bucking our men down the
field till within five or ten yards of
a touch-down, when the ball would
be secured on downs or oftener still
a fumble. Hill would kick out of
danger and then began the same
onslaught of line-bucks and end
runs on the part of U. P. but with
out ever getting over Stanford's
line fora touch-down. Wilson was
hurt and a former U. P. student
was substituted at quarter and
made the touch-down for Stanford
after catching a fumbled ball and
running sixty yards. The Stan
ford men were entertained at U. P.
and returned in the afternoon.
Wilson, Hill, Wardall, Bidwell,
McFadden, Nourse, Overacker,
Dole, Maples, Gilman, and Hall
made up the Stanford team.
