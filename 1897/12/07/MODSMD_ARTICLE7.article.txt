# A 						NEW COPYRIGHT LAW.
## Proposed Plans to Build Up Several Large National Libraries. 
### 
A movement has been placed on
foot here which if carried through
will make very important changes
in the copyright laws of this
country. It is proposed to require
authors obtaining the protection of
a copyright to supply copies of
their work to several depositories
located in the various large cities
of the United States. This will
build up several large national
libraries and guard against the
possible destruction of much of our
national literature by lire or other
wise. The following letter regard
ing the new plan is being sent out by
Librarian Nash,
Dear Sir: â€”At a meeting of the
Library Association of Central Cal
ifornia, held in San Francisco
November 12, 1897, it was unani
mously resolved that the associa
tion use its best endeavors to ob
tain the establishment of additional
copyright depositories in the United
States, and the librarians of the
University of California and lie
land Stanford Junior University
were appointed a committee to urge
the co-operation of senators and
representatives from California in
Congress, and to take such other
steps as might seem desirable to
the furtherance of the end in view.
Senator Perkins having been com
municated with, kindly consented
to introduce a bill in the United
tates Senate directing the estab
lishment of additional depositories
in the cities of Chicago, Denver,
San Francisco, and New Orleans.
Under the present law an author
in order to obtain a copyright must
deposit two printed copies of his
work with the Librarian of Congress
and the two copies remain in the
Library of Congress. To people
living at some distance from Wash
ington these books are practically
inaccessible, and especially is this
true in regard to residents of the
Pacific Coast. There is a wide
spread feeling that copies of copy
righted works should be available,
so far as possible, for general refer
ence: indeed it is the intention of
the law to render them thus avail
able, in return for the protection
guaranteed to the author. But
with only one depository in a
country so large as ours it is ob
vious that there is but slight facility
for general reference.
Another point in favor of addi
tional depositories is the danger of
the loss of our national archives in
case of a tire in the Congressional
Library. Surely these records are
sufliciently valuable to be placed
beyond the risk of possible anni
hilation.
A copy of the bill to be intro
duced in the United States Senate
by Senator Perkins is enclosed.
You are earnestly requested to as
sist in its passage by obtaining the
active interest and co-operation of
your representatives in the United
States Senate and House of Repre
sentatives.
J. C. Row-ell,
Librarian U. C.,
H. C. Nash,
Librarian L. S. J. U.,
Commiteee.
