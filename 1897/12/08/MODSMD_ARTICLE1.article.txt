# LAST NIGHT'S LECTURE.
## President Jordan Speaks to the Students as a Friendly and Sympathetic Critic. 
### 
The chapel was tilled last night
despite the rain. Dr. Jordan gave
a plain talk on the tendencies in
college life against which the
thoughtful students should be on
their guard. He spoke in high
terms of his impressions of the
student body on his return from
Washington; he then proceeded to
"say to them things he would not
let others say of them."
Among other things he said:
" There are some things which we
may talk over together, not in a
spirit of complaint,but that we may
coine to a better understanding. 1
am no ascetic; I believe in the ex
uberance and joy of youth. I was
a boy once, and I can remember
when; and so long as 1 live I shall
hope to be reckoned with the boys.
I am not growing old very fast.
When I hear men talking of 'Old
Jordan,' I know that they mean
the river, and not me. But then
there is one truth that has been
very much impressed upon my
mind by the years that 1 have
seen. It is that the strong man is
the gentleman. The man who
moves the world is the man who is
not tainted by the world's cor
rosion. I believe that virtue be
longs to the young and the strong
—not exclusively to the prig, the
milksop, or the invalid. It is the
mission of the University to bring
goodness out of the abundance of
life. The man we dream of as the
Stanford man, will stand up
against the bold dash of his op
ponents' rush line.
"It is a part of the Stanford spirit
never to be careless of the rights of
others—never to forget what a gent
leman owes to himself. The worst
phase of the life of our Northern
States is that we forget what is
meant by the old phrase "Noblesse
oblige." Our sense of honor is low.
The obligations of nobility have
been the glory of the South. In
our rush for equality we have, in
the North, sometimes forgotten
that all men are noble, and that
nobility has its obligations. To be
a gentleman demands that by day
or night, alone or in a crowd, he
shall be gentle and loyal and true.
"Rowdyism is no proof of
strength or courage. The bravest
of men are soft of tongue and quiet
of action. Selfishness does not
make for strength, nor is dissipa
tion an evidence of good-fellowship.
That is not joy that leaves a dark
brown taste in the mouth. The
difference in the morning that de
graded pleasures bring is some
thing that stays with you as long
as you live. A college fraternity
that is centered around a cham
pagne bottle is a public nuisance.
There are some such in existence
today, somewhere in the East, I am
told —the unmitigated To
choose todav, and day by day, the
very best that you know, is the
sole secret of success and happi
ness. This is not a dry precept,
but a cold, hard fact. It is worth
a thousand dollars a month to you
if you know how to act upon it.
It is not a truth of the books, nor
of the preachers, nor of John the

Baptist, nor of Plato, nor Emerson;
but is true right here on the cam
pus for you today.
"If you would be sane and
strong and helpful; if you would
be a leader of men, you will not
find your leadership in a bar-room.
While you are in there so neone
else will be martialing the forces of
life outside. If you are to be
worthy of yourself, to be your own
good com pa 113' through life, you
can not waste one part of your
powers in buying the pleasures
that come from drugs. If you are
to be worthy the love of a pure
woman —of a Stanford woman, per
haps —you have no right to such
associations with those who stand
on a lower moral plane.
"I am sorry to see the growth of
college politics. It is poor stuff —
'the pinchbeck imitation of a pew
ter original,' President White used
to call it. And as students are
more reckless than grown men, do
ing dishonorable things because
they have not experienced the con
sequences of transgression, so are
their politics, at their liveliest, more
corrupt than those of professional
politicians. From the ranks of
college politics political bosses are
too often recruited."
