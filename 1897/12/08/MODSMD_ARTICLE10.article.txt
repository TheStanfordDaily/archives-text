There are many things about
the Daily Palo Alto which the
professors and students as a whole
ought to know. The lot of the ed
itor-in-chief and the staff would be
a more pleasant one if the com
munity were better informed re
garding tho paper which supplies
it with news. No editor ever cares
to say much about his position
while still in office. But on the eve
of giving the paper into other hands
there is no reason why he should
not make a few explanations which
may serve to lighten the burden oi
those who follow him.
Perhaps the reason why most
people expect more of the Daily
Palo Alto staff than they should,
is because they have an idea that
all its members are paid for what
they do. This is a false impres
sion, but it is surprising how often
one meets it here. No one ever re
ceives a penny in remuneration for
his services on the Daily Palo
Alto except the editor-in chief, and
the amount which he receives seems
hardly worth mentioning when it
is taken into consideration that he
usually spends several semesters
on the paper before reaching the
highest position on the staff. The
present editor is free to confess
that he has received something less
than seventy-live dollars in cash,
trade, and tickets of admission to
games, etc., from the Daily Palo
Alto during the two years and a
half he has been on its staff. This
amount will perhaps be doubled
when all accounts are settled.
The Daily Palo Alto is not a
paying proposition, and those who
think the editors should work hard
to earn their salaries should disa
buse their minds of that idea.
That editor is doing well who es
capes with enough to reimburse
him for the extra clothes he has
worn out working around the
presses and for other expenses
which have been increased by rea
son of his editorial duties. But
this does not mean that he should

expect more. It is useless to think
of the paper from a financial point
of view. It would perhaps be bet
ter if the editor-in-chief were al
lowed no remuneration at all and
it was generally known that the
entire work of college journalism
was as far removed from monetary
considerations as work on any of
the athletic teams.
There is one great objection to
the conditions under which the pa
per is issued at present. It takes
up too much time of a limited
number of students. No person,
no matter how enthusiastic he may
be to have the publications of his
alma mater stand high in college
journalism, cares to devote the
major part of his energies to the at
tainment of that end. There is too
little co-operation among the stu
dents at large to distribute the bur
den. This makes the work of the
entire staff considerably harder
than it otherwise would be. Hut it
is on the editor-in-chief that the
heaviest burden falls. It is a la
mentable fact,but nevertheless a fact
that a person in this position can
do little else. He is seldom thought
of as a student, but always as an
editor. He has little time he can
call his own, and unless there is
some way of hiding himself it is
next to impossible to count on be
ing able to do his University work
at any given time. None of the
professors and few of the students
will consent to deal with anyone
but the editor himself if lie is any
where to be found. There is abso
lutely no need of this. The editor
in-chief should be given a chance
to devote his attention to the gen
eral supervision of the paper in
stead of being loaded down day af
ter day with various odds and ends
of unimportant news which could
be given to someone else just as
well. The editor who has the fu
ture interests of the paper at heart
will do all he can to distribute the
work among the members of his
staff, not so much to relieve him
self as to give future editors a
chance to become accustomed to
their duties. Outsiders should al
ways bear this in mind.
â€¢Something thould be done to
create a larger interest in making
the Daily Palo Alto one of the
leading college dailies of the coun
try. At present most of those who
enter the University with previous
training in newspaper work seek to
become correspondents for outside
papers and allow the student daily
to remain neglected. It is likewise
true that those who are in a posi
tion to give out University news
often take pains to see that it
reaches tlie city papers but leave
the University paper to shift for
itself. Two striking exceptions to
this rule are President Jordan and

Dr. Elliott. Nowhere has the
Daily Palo Alto found any
stauncher supporters than these
two.
There is one thing against which
almost every former editor of this
paper has protested. That is the
unfortunate situation of the Daily
Palo Alto office. Anyone who
stops to listen to the roar which
comes constantly from the power
house may be able to guess how
much of a strain it is to be com
pelled to do most of the editorial
work on the University daily on a
desk placed in a large open space
within twenty feet of a rapidly
running engine and within three
feet of the rumbling and snapping
belt which conveys the power to
the electric dynamos. It is need
less to say that a few hours of
mental work daily in this situation
is unusually expensive. It will
doubtless be some time before this
evil can l>e remedied, but we hope
that some day more commodious
quarters may be secured. In the
meantime when anyone has a com
plaint to make against anything
which has appeared in the paper it
would be no more than fair to recall
that ideal newspapers can be pro
duced only under ideal conditions.
