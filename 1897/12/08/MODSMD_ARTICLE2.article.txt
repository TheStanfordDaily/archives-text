# The 						Election Friday.
## 
### 
The polls for the student body
election on Friday will be open
from 10:80 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., and
this should give every student
ample-time to vote, if all who can
will vote early in the day.
The offices to be tilled at this elec
ction are those of editor-in-chief of
the Daily Palo Alto and Varsity
football manager. The only candi
date for editor is Mr. 0. C. Leiter, at
present managing editor of the pa
per. For football manager the can
didates are Duncan MacKinnon,
'99, and W. A. Prichard, '98.
Many students seem anxious to
know how much money is received
by the occupants of these positions.
The question so far as it applies to
the editor-in-chief of the Daily
Palo Alto is answered 011 the ed
itorial page today. The football
manager does not receive any pay
for his services, lie is allowed his
expenses each month from the stu
dent body treasury.
