# THE 						SOUTHERN TRIP.
## An Enjoyable Vacation in Store for the Members of the Stanford Musical Clubs. 
### 
The Glee and Mandolin Clubs
are daily receiving letters and in
quiries from the South, which seem
to warrant the prediction of a more
enjoyable trip than has ever before
been made by the clubs.
At Pasadena the members will
be entertained by the Valley Hunt
Club, the leading social club of the
city. The concert will be given un
der the club's auspices and a ball
in honor of the Stanford men will
be given after the concert. At Los
Angeles all the members will be
entertained, and, from the number
of balls and parties already
planned by the leading society peo
ple of the city for the clubs, their
visit to Los Angeles will be a joyous
one. A ball after the concert is
being arranged.
San Diego has never been visited
by the clubs, but there is a strong
Stanford delegation there which
promises to "whoop it up" for the
lx>ys on their arrival 011 New Year's
day. The management is arrang
ing a baseball game between a nine
picked from the two clubs and a
San Diego team. There are some
good baseball men in the clubs'
membership, and the contest will
not be so one-sided as one might
imagine. The club nine will be
about as follows: C.Strohn, catcher
and captain; Lanagan, pitcher; 11.
Strohn, first base; McNeil, second
base; Van Kaathoven, short-stop;
E. James, third base; George Busch,
center field; Sladen, right field;
King, left field. Advance Agent
Morrison and Treasurer Pomeroy
will be substitutes.
The Glee Club for the trip has
not yet been chosen. The members
of the Mandolin Club who will
make the trip were announced yes
terday. The Glee Club practises
twice a week, under the direction of
Mr. Morris, and is improving
rapidly. No news has yet been re
ceived from Advance Agent Mor
rison.
