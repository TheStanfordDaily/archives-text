There are certainly few students
here who do not appreciate the
friendly counsel and criticism of
President Jordan in his lecture last
Tuesday night. The members of
the faculty do not stand alone in
the desire to see Stanford manhood
and womanhood of the highest
type. In the effort to weed out
rowdyism, vulgarity, and all taint
of dissipation the students should
stand shoulder to shoulder with the
professors who are delegated to per
form the unpleasant duty of help
ing along the law of the survival
of the fittest as applied to the men
and women who are to receive the
advantages Stanford has to offer.
