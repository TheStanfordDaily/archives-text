With this number tlie present
editorial management of the Daily
Palo Alto comes to an end. The
issue tomorrow will complete \ ol
ume Eleven, and that issue will he
in other hands. The college ed
itor has no end of trials and tribu
lations; but in spite of all his
troubles he*would be less than
human if he did not see the dawn
of his last day in college journal
ism with sincere regret. No one
whose associations for two years or
more are closely centered around a
particular object can fail to become
firmly attached to it and to regard
it almost as a thing with life. The
Daily Palo Alto is a thing with
life, and there are many of us whose
interest in it leads us to hope that
its life may last as long as there re
mains a trace of these massive
stone buildings and there are chil
dren left who claim Stanford as
their fostering mother.
In parting, we wish to express to
the members of our staff, one and
all, our appreciation of their faith
ful and loyal support. Jt is too
little understood that the Daily
Palo Alto at any particular time
is not what the editor-in-chief
makes it, hut that its excellence
depends almost entirely upon the
work of the staff as a whole. To
our managing editor, Mr. Leiter,

we owe a public avowal of our
gratitude. Without his constant
and unfailing help many things
which were done this semester
could never have been attempted.
Any good points this volume may
have may he attributed to the en
thusiastic interest of the entire
staff. The editor is willing to as
sume the responsibility for its
shortcomings, and he is not un
mindful of the fact that they are
many.
