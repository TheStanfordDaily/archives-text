# Freshmen Good Financiers.
## 
### 
The Freshmen Glee given by the
Class of 1901 last Friday evening
in the gymnasium has proved to be
a success financially as well as soc
ially. The monetary affairs of the
dance were straightened out and
brought to a close last night, and
the books show a balance on the
right side. This is the first fresh
man glee that has ever come out
ahead financially, and the Class of
1901 is to be congratulated. Great
credit is due to the committee on
arrangements, who successfully en
gineered the affair. Following is
the financial statement furnished
by Mr. Chas. E. Waite, chairman
of committee on arrangement:
