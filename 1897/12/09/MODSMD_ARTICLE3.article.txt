# Poems by a Former Student.

We have received :i small collec
tion of poems by Mrs. Laura Smith
Greer, ex-'9B, entitled "Mother
Soul." The little book of twenty-five
{â€¢ages has a novel binding of green
straws woven together basket-fash
ion, perhaps with a view to suggest
"Blades of Grass." On opening
the book one at once perceives the
familiar manner and sentiment of
Walt Whitman, and some of the
lines are fully equal to his own.
One sometimes starts to smile at

some of the odd words and quite
unexpected metaphors, as for ex
ample when one reads that the
outer corner of a baby's eye is "a
sweet seductive little vortex that
whirls a mother's heart around in
its embrace"! But the smile is
checked and the odd words for
gotten as one feels the truth of the
mother's passion that inspired the
lines. The writer closes with these
very satisfactory words, "Not fare
well, but bide a wee. You will
hear from me again."
