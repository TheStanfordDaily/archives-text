# Carle to Play in the North.
## 
### 
Nat Carle, '98, while spending
his Christmas vacation at his home
in Seattle, Washington, will play
two games on the eleven of the Se
attle Athletic Club, of which he is a
member. The Seattle team will
line up against the Multnomah
Club of Portland in Seattle on
Christmas, and on New Year's
day in Portland. The Stanford
men who live in Portland are pre
paring to give Carle an enthusias
tic reception when he appears on the
field at Portland. Last year the
Seattle team defeated the Multno
mahs 4-0 and the papers were full
of praise for Carle, saying "a big
guard did it all."
