# NEXT YEAR'S VARSITY.
## Material in the Second Eleven for a Strong Team Next Thanksgiving. 
### 
Berkeley lias been counting a
great deal on beating Stanford on
the gridiron next Thanksgiving
day because so many of our old
Varsity players will graduate this
year. For their benefit and for
our own satisfaction we call atten
tion to the following strong aggre
gation of second eleven men, many
of whom will be on next year's
Varsity team:

second team, comes from Tacoma.

team that year. In 1894 and 1895

In 1896 he tilled the positions of
quarter and half on the Y. M.C. A.
