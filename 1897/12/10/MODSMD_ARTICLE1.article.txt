# STUDENT BODY ELECTION.
## W.A. Prichard Elected Football Manager, and O.C. Leiter Editor of the "Daily Palo Alto." 
### 
At 12:30 today the election was
in full blast. Groups of animated
speakers gathered in various parts
of the quadrangle, predicting the
result. Some of the crowd around
the polls stood in line to vote,
others electioneered, while not a
few were mere onlookers.
Everybody said the election was
to be close, but when asked how
matters stood said that the "other
man" was ahead. Some of the
voters did not seem to know what
to do with their ballots. One en
thusiastic freshman began at the
head of the line, oblivious of the
murmurs of tired waiters.
Mr. Morgan stood his ground
like a Trojan. At 2:30 his voice
was hoarse from the repetition of
"This way, please." "You should
put your ballot in this box." "Say,
what's your name? You forgot to
give it." " Don't crowd. Plenty
of tune."
O. 0. Leiter, candidate for
editor-in-chief of the Daily Palo
