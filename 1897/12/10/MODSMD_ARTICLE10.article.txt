## Prize Awarded by the Committee to Miss Genevra Sisson, '99. 
### 
The following was yesterday ad
judged the best sketch submitted
under the conditions of the Special
Edition Prize Contest, which were
these : " The article must be a
character sketch of not more than
live hundred words. The subject
must be a Stanford character —an
actual individual or a type. 1 ' To
Miss Genevra Sisson was awarded
the five-dollar prize.
Our Enthusiast.
She came among us three
months ago. She was brilliant
and sparkling, with a wealth of
repartee, a naive manner, and en
thusiastic, whole-souled nature, and
a heart charged full of affection for
the world and the people on it.
She was alive from the ends of
her glossy hair to the tips of the
lingers that never would be still;
alive with a nervous vitality that
said constantly, "Feel — think —
live"; alive with a strength of feel
ing that refused to be harnessed
and to walk meekly about guided
by the reins of a set program, that
broke the traces of recitation hours
and set off on a mad gallop 'cross
country with the wreck of over-due
papers and approaching examina
tions flying wildly around her.
And we, Zoryada and I, attempt
ed the task of taming her. We
came to her room in Roble the
evening before an examination and
found her with the long lists of ir
regular verbs still unlearned. Both
her windows were open, the vivid
sunset glow was streaming in, and
she herself was standing, with hair
unbound, gazing beyond the red
woods that top the western moun
tains. As we stood in the door
way, we heard these words:
"Oh, our manhood's prime vigour !
No spirit feels waste.
Not a muscle is stopped in its play
ing nor sinew unbraced.
Oh, the wild joys of living !"
As she heard our movements
she sprang toward us, her face ir
radiated equally by (he sunset with
out and her own happiness within.
"I am so glad to see you !" she
exclaimed. "I am having such a
glorious time. I have been recit
ing Browning to myself all after
noon."
We felt sacrilegious, but univer
sity students must pass "ex's," so
we said: "What about your irreg
ular verbs? You will 'flunk' tomor
row."
The glow faded, and she an
swered, "I '11 learn them by and
by. Just let me finish 'Saul' for
you."
But Zoryada answered firmly,
"No, you must employ the heart
and the soul and the senses in a
mechanical grind until you get
these verbs."
After an hour of effort we got her
quieted down, and then in another
hour she learned her stint better
than we with our digging for days.
She is a cometic genius whose orbit
has never yet been traced.
She is full of theories, full of
schemes most of which seem to
us when dissected coldly to be
visionary. But to her, with her
enthusiasm, everything is practi
cable. Zoryada and 1 smile in
dulgently at the extravaganzas of
her inconsistent hopes, but we re
vere the self-forgetful devotion
that makes them real to her. We
do not attempt to show her the fal
lacies of her dreams. There is no
room for our skepticism in her.

heart, and if there were we should
not plant it ; for to us her child
like faith in humanity is a stronger
influence for right living among
the children of men than any or
all of the university courses in
sociology and ethics.
The judges in the above contest
have told us that among sketches
submitted they found not only a
best, but more than one second
best. Of these we present, with a
few changes, a sketch by Miss Ruth
Adams, entitled
A Fraternity Man.
Nonchalantly yet majestically he
saunters down the arcade. His six
feet two of dignity and frat-exclu
siveness threaten to overpower you
unless a saving sense of humor is
at your command.
If overpowered you shrink back
into the friendly shadow of the
flower-bed and venture forth only
when he has passed and the atmos
phere has resumed its normal
warmth.
If merely amused you turn your
chair a trifle toward him and bend
upon him a Svengali gaze which
causes vibrations even up in that
high stratum where he moves and
has his being, a gaze which brings
his own to meet yours when he has
referred the magnetic disturbances
to their proper source.
You begin a series of observa
tions: note his manner, its languid
ease, the mark of aristocracy; take
in all the details of his dress, from
the brown derby, set at quite the
correct tilt, to the coin-toed shoes.
Your glance lingers upon his im
maculate cuffs, and his collar, high
to the last degree of highness con
sistent with breathing, and you
have a fleeting feeling of compas
sion as you imagine him trying to
study over the fortifications which
surround his neck.
You gaze }'eta little deeper and
see beyond his eyes back to the
place where he has stored a good
stock of general intelligence which
might shine forth were it not for
the overlying rubbishy ideas of
which he seems most proud. He is
not so much to blame for these
ideas, however, ah- are the circum
stances of his life. Having had a
very easy time of it, so far, he
imagines that he has himself to
thank for all his benefits.
You conclude finally that he is
a pretty fair sort, and think you
might like to know him if it were
possible for you to exist in his at
mosphere. There being some doubt
about that, you reverse the mag
netic current which has kept him a
statue on the curb; he resumes his
stroll and you your book.
