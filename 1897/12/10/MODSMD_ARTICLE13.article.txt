# Co-operative Housekeeping.
## 
### 
When 1 decided to come to Stan
ford a friend proposed to me to
unite with some others in forming
a co-operative household. Al
though doubtful at first I finally
assented, and have lived in that
way during my whole college resi
dence. As the result of my exper
ience I am convinced that, in spite
of some drawbacks, co-operative
housekeeping is the most satisfact
ory solution of the problem of uni
versity life for students of limited
means. Our highest monthly bills
did not exceed sixteen dollars, and
while we have not lived luxuriously,
we have lived well enough. When,
after a trial of one semester, we
dismissed our housekeeper and di
vided her duties among ourselves,
our expenses were much less than
sixteen dollars. Since that time
we have had a woman to do clean
ing one day in the week, but other
wise have done all our own work.
Our division of work was as fol
lows: 1 prepared breakfast, a stu
dent who was free at the right time
set the lunch, and the work of the
dinner was divided between the
other two women. The boys washed
the dishes, and one of them filled
the lamps, another swept the
porches, a third set the tables, and
a fourth laid the lire over night in
the kitchen stove. We all cared
for our own rooms and divided the
care of the parlor, dining-room, and
bath-room. Fortunately one of us
did not do regular University work
and so was able to attend to the
ordering of supplies.
W r e rented a house furnished
with the essentials, to which, by an
assessment of three or four dollars
each at the beginning, we added
many comforts and conveniences.
We furnished our own table and
bed linen, as well as the pictures
and ornaments whLli, with our
piano, made our house comfortable
and homelike. Friday evenings
we entertained in a modest way,
and Sunday evenings we sat round
the fire and chatted or sang prepar
atory to writing our home letters,
serving, meanwhile, chocolate in
the parlor.
It is well not to have too many
in the family. Six is a good num
ber —four is still better, although
the greater the number the less the
expense. But with too large a
number there is a certain waste of
time and energy which few students
can afford. Of course the members
of the family must be congenial and
eacli feel the responsibility of doing
a fair share of the work. Boys are
willing workers but can seldom see
dirt. When a furnished house can
not be had, the necessary articles
can usually be contributed from the
several homes, or they can be
bought cheaply at second hand,
and got rid of, when so desired, in
the same way. Living is cheap in
Palo Alto, the tradesmen call for
orders and deliver, and well-made
bread and cakes can be had.
If the dinner is served at noon,
which our family has preferred, it
is of course necessary that there
shall be some one in the family
who is free from University work
at that time. In this case the eve
ning meal would be light and
dainty, and the family therefore
often be able to invite friends, for
whom it would not be possible,
with the time at their disposal, to
prepare a full dinner. This free
dom in entertaining is one of the
most desirable features of co-opera
tive housekeeping, and some of the
pleasantest memories of my Uni
versity life will be associated with
these occasions of homelike inter
course.
