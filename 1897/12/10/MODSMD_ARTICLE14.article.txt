How can a woman write up En
cina? She must frankly confess
that she can not treat it as a
whole, and she offers a mere sketch
of one phase of life there.
One evening, a few weeks ago,
a party of women were just enter
ing the dining-room at Encina,
when they were startled by "Rah!
rah! rah! Rah! rah! rah! Rah!
rah! Stanford!" They stopped
abruptly. Was this the usual En
cina greeting to guests? "It's the
night of the football rally," the
matron said encouragingly, and the
women went on more calmly.
What a fine dining-room it is!
Longer, broader, lighter than Ro
ble's hall, and with a most impress
ive fireplace facing the doorway.
To the left of this fireplace was
the guest table, where the women
were soon seated. Then they looked
across the room where the tables
were filled with boys who seemed,
for the moment, busily engaged
with their dinners.
The next instant "Rah! rah! rah!
Rah! rah! rah! Rah! rah! Stan
ford!" again greeted the ear, while
many feet beat a heavy accompan
iment. The ogre of the hall had
just put his head in the doorway
aud the boys continued their war
fare of racket until the head disap
peared.
After a short interval of conver
sation in conventional tones, there
burst forth "What's the matter
with Billerwin?" "He's all right,
you bet, every time." "Who's all
right?" "Billerwin." "Who?"
"Billerwin." And then theStanford
yell again cleft the air. Each wo
man had a wild desire to join in it
audibly, but she just clenched her
teeth and gave it under her breath
and let her feet prove safety-valves
for her surplus energy. Even the
dishes on a passing tray imbibed of
the general enthusiasm and leaped
from their enslaving bounds. That
their patriotic spirit was appre
ciated by the students was shown
by a repetition of the "Rah! rah!
rah!"
Shortly after, the majority of the
boys arose and with rhythmic step
marched out, giving a final yell.
Then the overflowing spirits sought
their level in the chapel rally, and
the house became quiet.
"Don't think we always have so
much noise," explained the matron,
"The boys have to express them
selves tonight." But the visiting
women had no adverse criticism,
either on lips or in hearts; they
felt that the noise was an external
expression of the college spirit that
welds many diverse characters so
closely together that they react as
one body upon whatever promises
good or evil to their beloved alma
mater.
