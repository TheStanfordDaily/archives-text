When through the courtesy and
suggestion of Mr. Schwartz we, the
women of Stanford University,
were called upon to decide whether
or not we would undertake to issue
an edition of the Daily Palo Alto,
we were in a quandary. The ques
tion was not to speak or forever
afterwards hold our peace, for the
college press is always open to us.
We did not wish to blindly follow
a fad, if women's editions are fads;
nor did we think it well to divorce
the interests of the men and women
of the University. All of these
questions were discussed in a meet
ing of the women attended by the
usual ten per cent, of our number;
and it was this very ten per cent,
attendance that made those present
determine to accept the offer of Mr.
Schwartz. We hoped by so doing
to succeed in getting the women to
work together, and to arouse among
them some little enthusiasm, not
only for the Daily Palo Alto, but
for student body affairs in general,
ilence we present this sheet, not as
an ideal newspaper production, but
as representing some good hard
work done towards welding more
firmly together the college interests
of men and women at Stanford
University.
