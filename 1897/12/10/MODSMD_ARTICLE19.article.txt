One of the things eminently
proper and desirable to notice in
this edition of the Palo Alto is
the attitude of the University men
towards the University women.
The absence of anything like a
patronizing or tolerant or indulgent
relation is in itself a negative good
which we should be grateful for,
even if we had nothing better. But
we have what is much better. We
have the unquestioned concession
of a perfect equality of rights, priv
ileges, and duties. \V T e enjoy an
unemphasized though constant
courtesy which is vastly more re
spectful and agreeable than an ef
fusive gallantry.
There is, perhaps, no other uni
versity in the world where men
have fully admitted that women
are entitled to a free individuality
and self-direction. In the face of
this it is painful to acknowledge
that the [Stanford women are only

timidly and slowly waking up to a
sense of the responsibility which
this state of things lays upon them,
to do their share in the student
body work.
It is not surprising, nor is a little
conservatism to be condemned, but
it is high time that the women in
this University should be vital and
earnest and active in its affairs.
