The feature of the student
body election was the great good
humor that covered the intense in
terest and personal anxiety of the
crowd of voters. The officers at
the ballot-box had some difficulty
to restrain certain inexperienced
voters who showed a nervous de
sire to deposit their ballots in the
first friendly hand over the box,
and to omit the formality of a check
against their names on the register.
As usual, the candidates were
drawn irresistibly to the quad to
stand in suspense, eyeing the line
furtively for four hours.
Partisanship and objectionable
electioneering can not be killed off
in a day. They have been as ac
tive as ever this election; but at
least there has been a step in the
right direction, in the entire lack
of officious electioneering of stu
dents while at the polls.
