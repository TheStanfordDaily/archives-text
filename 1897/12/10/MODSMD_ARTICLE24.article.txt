llow many of u.s would scorn to
accept charity, and yet here we are
surrounded by opportunities, lav
ishly given. Does not the con
stant taking in for four years, with
no accompanying giving out, tend
to pauperize?

life, to do something to show that
we are not totally unconscious of
the bounty we share. All that is
expected is that we should be men
and women respecting our sur
roundings and each other.
At Encina, at Roble, in the
chapel and the Library, property is
not always treated with due consid
eration when its only business is
to serve us. The tooth of time is
not always accountable for the wear
and tear; there are also evidences
of the lingers of the freshman.
