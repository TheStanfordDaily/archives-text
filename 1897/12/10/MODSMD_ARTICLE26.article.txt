Our University mother is com
ing home! We will all be heartily
glad to see her with lis again. If
our love and deep respect can cheer
her at this season they are hers.

The King's Daughters, and other
women students, have been making
an effort to procure more wooden

they may soon be successful, as
students are inviting all "the ills
that man is heir to" by sitting on
the stone curbs.
