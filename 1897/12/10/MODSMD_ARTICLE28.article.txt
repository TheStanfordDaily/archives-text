Eveu and anon lamentation is
heard over the lack of class spirit
anion#; lis. No doubt a display of
class spirit under many circum
stances is highly commendable.
The Class of '98, for example, will
leave the University under better
auspices if its metnbsrs show them
selves possessed of sufficient class
spirit to raise the Annual debt.
There is, however, a spirit more
desirable —a college spirit —a spirit
which makes one unwilling to cast
discredit either upon the Univer
sity or any of its students. Doubt
less such a spirit does exist and it
is due to thoughtlessness, that at
times there seems to outsiders to be
a lack of it.
One who is initiated may under
stand that a volley of hisses in the
midst of a speech containing noth
ing offensive simply indicates that
a part of the audience does not
wish to listen to that speaker at that
time. An outsider draws one of
two inferences: either the speaker
personally is unworthy of attention,
or else petty spite and prejudice
are given loose rein among us.
The first is manifestly unjust to
the person in question if he be a
gentleman, as all people who stay
at Stanford are supposed to be. The
second is an impression which
those who wish to be considered
liberal minded men and women
can not afford to have formed in re
gard to them.
