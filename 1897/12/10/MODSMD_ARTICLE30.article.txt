Progress is calling women more
and more into the active life of the
world, out of the home and into the
work of organizations which multi
ply as civilization advances. In
these organizations women who
know their duty are often among
the most active members, hut when
the matter of conducting assem
blies, meeting arguments, and ad
dressing public audiences is in
volved, they accomplish these
things only at an expense of ner
vous force that seems almost
wicked.
At Stanford we have the world
in miniature. The women, as a
rule, keep out of most class and
student body offices, but increas
ingly they are being brought for
ward to meet our men and Berke
ley men in debate.
These are often young women
just wakened to a realization of
their part in the world. They make
the attempt. Oftener than not, they

do credit to themselves and their
University. Hut they do it under
an unnecessarily severe nervous
strain, for they go iuto it without
that two or three years' practice at
secondary schools which most de
hating men had had when they en
tered college. The debating and
speech-making ut such schools is
not always of a high order; it af
fords the humorously inclined
many a quiet laugh; but it is a be
ginning—a beginning which many
a girl in college, many a woman in
active life wishes she had made.
If indeed it is inevitable that wo
men should stand shoulder to
shoulder with their brothers in this
world's work, should need coni
mand of tongue as well as of pen,
can any one of us afford to delay
that beginning which grows harder
the longer one noglects to make it?
Those of us who hope after grad
uation not to sink forever into
peaceful torpidity, can offer to
round out the membership of the
existing woman's debating society;
that accomplished, can form
another —for four hundred girls
and more, there should not be less
than two such clubs.
And in after years those of us
who find ourselves possessed, as
teachers, mothers, or writers, with
influence over the lives of another
generation, can see to it that girls
who are likely to do the work of
active citizens are given the early
training into which tradition now
guides the average boy.
