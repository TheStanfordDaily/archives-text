A snatch of conversation over
heard upon the quadrangle pre
sents a problem worthy of solution.
A woman, presumably a freshman,
stated that she enjoyed her work
here, but that she was so lonely
that she didn't know if she could
stay the year out.
The confession awakened reflec
tions. What are the social condi
tions at Stanford, that such an ex
perience is possible? There is little
time for social life, and students, for
the most part, are widely separated.
The Saturdays and Sundays may
hold pleasures for the fortunate
ones of lvoble or of social house
holds, but to the unacquainted
their loneliness is depressing.
Are the Christian Associations
and the King's Daughters alone
in their efforts to promote fellow
ship? The doors of the faculty are
always open to students, but it is
often said of the students them
selves, "Every one is too busy for
social life." Are we too busy or
too thoughtless? Have we any
right to be either? Why does not
that spirit which prompts the Stan
ford alumnus to know every fellow
alumnus in the same town pervade
the campus? One finds it in the
gymnasium, but the friendliness of
one hour a day does not cancel the
indifference of the other twenty
three.
A "good morning" between class
mates as they meet upon the quad
or in the bus would certainly be in
place, and might brighten the day
for each.
At the close of the year comes
our beautiful unique Promenade
Concert, where hospitality and good
feeling abound. No social lines
are drawn; yet one-half of the stu
dents do not stay for this festivity,
many because they do not feel well
enough acquainted to make it worth
while. We hope the five months
between now and the end of the
year may see the birth of a spirit
of social fellowship at Stanford.
