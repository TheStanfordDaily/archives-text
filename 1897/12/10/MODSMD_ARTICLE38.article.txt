The English girl? You all know
her. Her haunt is the English
building, although she frequents
the neighboring realms of Ethics,
Art History, and the languages.
Within these sacred precincts, con
scious of her might, she is bold as
any lion; beyond in the cold, cold
quad, she is meek as any lamb.
She interprets Rossetti's sonnets, so
don't face her with a geometrical
problem; she knows the number of
feet in a Spenserian line, avoid ask
ing her the dimensions of a cord of
wood; she quotes Shakspere and
Browning, spare her the formula
for H 2 S0 4 ; she knows all about
the influence of Ruskin and Arnold,
so do not mention the effects of
tariff reform. She lias "too much
soul" to prosecute me for this "gross
libel"; she will cry out in the im
mortal words of the Sequoia bard
let: "Shades of Keats, Shelley, Ky
ron, and Edward Maslin Hulme —
I shall yet be great."
The History girl is a "creature
of books entirely"; she always car
ries a portfolio, which is the badge
of her tribe. Syllabi and receipts
for syllabus fees, theses, and set pa-

pers bound her horizon. Her very
clothes seem bound together with
little brass clamps, and she looks
at you as if she meditated demand
ing; a reference for every assertion
you make. {She is well known in
the Library. Mommsen is not mum
mery to her, Gardiner and Traill
are the least of her troubles, colon
ial records are her treasure-trove.
She pores over dusty volumes un
til the librarian's rap warns her of
the flight of time, then hies her
homeward with a little packet of
notes —the germ of some report or
thesis which by next year will re
pose in dusty oblivion on some
shelf iu the History oflice—a sight
for gods and freshmen.
As one of our observing young
instructors remarked, "There are
two kinds of girls in the 'lab/ the
one who looks in the microscope
and the one who looks over it."
The former is plain, rather stout,
and steps firmly. Her independ
ence and firm will are shown even
in little things. She has abso
lutely no sympathy with the dogs
and cats which are being sliced up
in the "lab," and she searches with
the interest of a fiend for new sub
jects for sacrifice. Her hands are
stained with iodine and her dress
burned with acids. She has a
great interest in everything per
taining to science and a curiosity
for anything. She talks "shop" at
all times and in all places, not ex
cepting the dinner table. With an
eagle's eye she sees bacteria 011 the
cake and microbes in the water.
Some people find her entertaining,
while others avoid her.
The girl who looks over her mi
croscope is pretty and stylish and
has a string of worshiping admir
ers ready to do the work for her.
She takes science work for fun, and
has it, but like all pleasures, it is
fleeting and her stay in the "lab"
is short.
Her major is Ethics. She takes
as much of it as she can possibly
work in and thinks there is noth
ing that equals it. She advises
all freshmen wavering as to their
program to take at least one
course in Ethics. She is aesthet
ically inclined by nature; almost
too much so for this common work
aday world. She takes 110 science,
no mathematics —no, not she; some
English, especially the poets, a lit
tle history, several languages, and
—ethics ; this is her course. She
is expert in the languages. She
opens her book and seems to ab
sorb its contents with little more
than a bird's eye view. She pro
nounces well, although her voice
is a scarcely audible treble and her
r's altogether inaudible. She is
imbued with poetry, is well ac
quainted with all the poets, ancient
or modern, and quotes copiously.
She writes occasionally and, when
she does, it is good.
She even dresses aesthetically. No
stiff shirt-waists for her. Dainty
little beruffled gowns are her style,
on the quad as well as elsewhere.
Sailor hats are .too prim, to un
bending. Large brimmed and
drooping ones, artistically trimmed,
are what she requires. She moves
slowly and gracefully. Calm and
serene is she always for — her ma
jor is Ethics.
