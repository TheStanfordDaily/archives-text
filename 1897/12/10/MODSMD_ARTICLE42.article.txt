# Self-Supporting Students.
## 
### 
Stanford is different from other
universities, and one of its best
characteristics is its self-supporting
students.
In no other college that I know
of is such encouragement given to
the plucky and determined man or
woman who wishes to aid himself
and to whom a university educa
tion means more work than purely
mental labor. It seems to be a
part of the plan of the institution
to help every one who helps him
self. Among the particular aids
are those offered by the various de
partments. The assistant libra
rians are all students. They give
so many hours each day and re
ceive their tuition and a small sal
ary. In the laboratories the assist
ants are students who have done
good work in those courses. The
same is true of the gymnasiums
and in the various offices.
Another large class of students
who entirely or partially help them
selves are the typewriters. Some
work in oflices, some independently.
A portion do thesis work, another
portion do only syllabus work, and
some take only odd jobs. Perhaps
the next largest class of wage-earn
ers are the waiters of Encina, Ito
ble, and other boarding-houses.
These receive their meals and a
small amount of money, and work
between three and four hours a day.
It is a great encouragement to
these men to know that our hon
ored president and at least one of
the major professors, when college
boys, were found among those who
wore white aprons and handed
around the coffee and cake.
The Camp, at present under the
management of a student, is a great
help to many a man. Though per
haps the board and rooms do not
quite equal Encina, young men are
glad to stay at the Camp rather
than do without their degrees.
Almost all the citv papers have
student reporters. How well this
pays 1 do not know; it probably de

pends upon the reporter. There
are a few students who "coach." I
am told that this is both pleasant
and profitable. In Latin and Greek
the fee is lifty cents an hour.
Some women help with the work
in private houses, some take care
of children during certain days in
the week or during certain hours
in the day. In the various halls
there are those who look after the
laundry and pay a good part of
their expenses that way.
Several men do repair work —
some mend bicycles; some, shoes.
Another man does framing very
artistically and neatly.
I am told of one young woman
who paid all expenses last year by
writing for the Blade Cat; another
one who read to a friend whose
eyes were weak.
A few, whom nature has favored
with classical features or good looks,
have been able to earn some odd
dollars by posing for the Art class.
Speaking of art makes me think of
the prize offered by the Annual
every year fora design for the
cover. Other prizes are offered
during the year for football songs,
stories, and yells, and for poems
and stories for the Annual. So in
many ways do the persevering and
needy help themselves, and it is
from these ranks that those will
come of whom the institution will
in the future be proudest.
