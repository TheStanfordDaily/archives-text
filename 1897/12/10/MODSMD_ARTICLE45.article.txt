Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The following opportunity for
original research may be of interest
to your readers.
Goths and Vandals, race historic,
Are they passed into the shadow?
Are they gone in all their fierceness?
Leaving but their name in story?
Gone the Goths, but not the
Vandals,
For the Vandals still are with us,
Daily writing out their story,
Daily making marks by which they
Will for longtime be remembered.
Would you gather all the data,
Work it out into a thesis,
Make of it a lengthy treatise?
P'irst consult five hundred
volumes,
In the chapel you will find them.
Every volume in the chapel,
Every book in every book-rack
Makes indubitable statement
That the Vandals still are with us.
