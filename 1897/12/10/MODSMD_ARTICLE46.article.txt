# Womens's Athletic Association.
## 
### 
The athletic interests of the wo
men students at Stanford are con
trolled by the Women's Athletic
Association, which is governed by a
constitution granted it by the stu
dent body.
This association is directly gov
erned by a board of directors,
which consists of a president, a
vice-president, a secretary, a treas
urer, a representative from each
class and one from the specials, and
one member from the women of the
faculty. The interests are divided
among five clubs: tennis, basket
ball, archery, pedestrian, and bi
cycling. The three former are com
paratively well equipped; all hold
more or less regular meets, games,
or tournaments. A semi-annual
tennis tournament is held for the
possession of a handsome silver
cup, while the archers compete for
a trophy pin in the shape of a
golden arrow. Although the Var
sity basket-ball team plays an oc
casional game with another college
or preparatory school, yet in bas
ket-ball as in all contests the main
objects are the physical develop
ment and the pleasure of the con
testants.
Membership in the association
is open to all women who are stu
dents in the University or are
members of the family of one of
the Stanford faculty. The asso
ciation dues are twenty-live cents a
semester.
