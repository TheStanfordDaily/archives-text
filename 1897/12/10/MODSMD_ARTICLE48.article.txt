# Life on the Row.
## 
### 
One can not say that he knows
college life, Stanford college life,
until he has lived at least one se
mester on the Row. You ask why.
It is because living in a drafty
attic and carrying all one's own
water is essentially character
istic of student life at Stanford.
There is a bet'er re.ison than
that. If one lives on the Row, one
comes to realize the real strength
of the bond between student and
professor that is so much talked
about, both here and abroad, and
which is felt but vaguely by the
student whose mode of living takes
him away from the campus at
night.
To be sure, one goes to the delight
ful ''at homes," even from a. distance,
and perhaps the coming so far adds
to the pleasure of the evening.
But these evenings are not the
best of it. You are sure to have
real, cordial, sympathetic relations
in one or two households outside ot
the one in which you live.
Perhaps your major prof, lives a
few doors away and perhaps, too, he
forgets to draw his curtains, so that
as you pass on a cold night to till
your water jar you can look in and
see him sitting in the warm flicker
ing firelight; and then sometimes,
if it is not too late, you will leave
your jar hidden in a dark corner of
the porch and go in fora half hour.
These half hours are the best of all,
and if there are many of them you
may in the course of time come to
take Dr. Jordan's suggestion and
call your major professor by his
first name.
