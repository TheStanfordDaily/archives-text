The King's Daughters' circle,
formed last year, holds Wednesday
meetings on the campus and a Sun
day afternoon meeting in Palo
Alto once a month. The"In His
Name" cross is the badge, and the
biography should be:

"She doeth little kindnesses that
most leave undone or despise,
And naught that can another
bless is low esteemed in her
eyes."
To help one other student to
live a fuller life was named as
a definite object of the work of
this year. Decorating the chapel,
collecting garments for dispens
ing societies in San Francisco,
sending flowers, working to have
seats provided for those who study
in the quad: these are some of the
"nexte thynges" the members are
doing. On Thanksgiving day the
circle was at home to girls away
from home, in Miss lvellogg's in
viting parlors.
liitsof helpfulness can not be tab
ulated and some of the work is never
reported even at the meetings. The
King's Daughters would ask the
gift bestowed on the monk in the
legend, "that of blessing whom they
pass and never knowing it after
ward."
