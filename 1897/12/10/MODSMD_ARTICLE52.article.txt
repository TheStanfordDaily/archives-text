# Fraternity "Mothers."
## 
### 
With the increase of fraternities
and the erection of their many new
chapter-houses has arisen the
happy custom of having one of the
members' mothers, or some other
suitable person, domiciled in the
fraternity-house to add the little at
tentions and care-taking, us well
as the social advantages, that a
woman's influence must needs
bring.
In this way more than one of the
houses of the Greek-letter side of
life have been transformed from a
careless, ruthless haunt of a club
of men, where the freshman initiate
has silently longed for some of the
home firelight, to a, smoothly run
ning. cheery home that even the
hardened senior recognizes as a
snug and cosy corner in his Univer
sity career.
Among the fraternity mothers
are numbered Mrs. Baker of the
Zeta Psi house, whose hospitality is
proverbial among faculty and stu
dents; Mrs. liice of Sigma Rho Eta,
to whom the most bruised football
player turns for comfort and the
sorest debating contestant finds
witty support. Mrs. VanKaathoven
graces the new Delta Tau Delta
house with her quaint and gracious
charm of manner, and the Beta
members are equally fortunate in
having Mrs. Braden with them.
Delta U., Sigma Nu, Kappa Alpha,
and Phi Delta Theta are also num
bered among those who are favored
with these guardian mothers, of
each one of whom it may be said
that "her children rise up and call
her blessed."
