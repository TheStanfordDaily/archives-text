# The
						Wellesley Elective System.
## 
### 
There are many points in which
Wellesley differs very radically
from Stanford, but in none more
than in the matter of electives.
Like Stanford, Wellesley requires
one hundred and twenty hours for
graduation, but unlike Stanford,
she has taken a large number of
these hours for "required" work.
Eight hours of mathematics, twelve
of science, nine of English compo
sition, eight of Bible, and six of
philosophy are required of each
student in addition to the forty
hours that are to be divided between
two major subjects. So that
whereas the Stanford student has
the most of his time at his own
disposal, the Wellesley girl has but
a small portion of the one hundred
and twenty hours to devote to sub
jects of her own choice.
