# Roble Life.

"Ting-ling! Ting-ling!" 'Tis the
rising bell at lioble which comes
faintly to her ears. She thinks to
herself it's only seven o'clock; she'll
rest u few moments longer and then
get up. "Tick, tick, tick," goes the
little clock on her table; then a
voice says: "Aren't you going to
get up today?"
''What —time —is —it?" comes
slowly and indistinctly from the
covers.
"It's eight o'clock, you'd better
hurry," and the energetic speaker
slams the door unfeelingly. "Lazy
Mary" rubs her eyes, gazes at the
clock a minute, and with a desper
ate effort arouses herself. By 8:15
she gets down to her place in the
dining-room just as the head waiter
is shutting the door. "Mush? Beef
steak or mutton chop?" She gives
her order, says a few words to the
girl next to her, then wonders why
the waiter does not hurry. The
door rattles. Some poor unfortu
nate has been locked out, and
though pitying the girl on the other
side of the threshold she mentally
congratulates herself on the rapid
ity with which she can dress.
Ciasses until 11:30; then she comes
home, goes to her room, which is
well aired by this time (if her room
mate has not forgotten to raise the
window), makes her bed, shakes up
the cushions, puts the books in
order, and gets at least part of a
lesson before lunch. When the
luncheon bell rings, farewell to the
books. Roble girls are prompt at
the noon hour —except a few who
loiter around the door with Paul or
(iene. Things are gayer than they
were at breakfast. Every one takes
more time. There is always some
bit of news or anecdote to tell, some
"ex" to discuss, or —or —something.
She lingers over her fruit and cake
until Frances says, "Well I must go
to the Library," and then every one
remembers something important
which she must do. There is no
telling how a Roble maid spends
her afternoons. Chacune a son
gout.
At six the lights are lit and the
dinner hour is lively.
Some with hats on have just come
in from a tramp, others are fresh
and bright after the gymnasium
hour; perhaps a few girls have some
boys to dinner, in which case the
visiting gentlemen are properly sur
veyed and their names announced
to those who do not know them.
It is the fifth of the month and as
the girls leave the dining-room
they see two formidable looking
men at one of the tables. This
means rent day. Of course Mary's
money is in her room. By the
time she gets it there is a long line
of girls ahead of her and she must
wait her turn. Overhead she hears
the shuffling of feet and some one
playing "Hot Time in the Old Town
Tonight." The parlor carpets are
rolled into one corner and dancing
is the order of the hour. By 7:8(3
or 8 the carpets are replaced and
hardly a sound is heard, save per
haps the occjisional ring of a bell
announcing a caller for some lucky
"co-ed," or the arrival of her escort
for the evening's party or concert.
10:30 and lights are out. A
few minutes later she hears smoth
ered giggles and the tread of feet —
some half dozen returning from a
spread in a friend's room. "Poor

little Roble maid?" Oh, no! She
is one of the happiest creatures on
the campus.
