# Women's Sitting-Room.
## 
### 
Perhaps there may still be some
students who are unaware that the
room adjoining the architect's oliiee,
and next to the University Book
store, has been fitted up fora
Women's Sitting-Room. All Uni
versity women are invited to use
the room freely. It is hoped that
it will till a long-felt want and be
come a University institution, de
veloping with the University, and
contributing more effectively each
year to the comfort and welfare of
our women.
It is to Mrs. C. H. Gilbert pri
marily, and to the faculty ladies
and students whom she interested,
that our thanks are due for having
initiated the movement that has
resulted in the openingof this room.
She realized the fact that women
students not residing on the campus
had no place to which they might
retire either for the purpose of
getting warm or dry, or to rest.
Also she saw that they had no suit
able place where they might lunch
together, with an opportunity for
preparing a hot drink, and where
student body politics, et cetera,
might better be talked over than in
the library or other unsuitable
p laces.
All last year the room was little
used,although a few students found
it exceedingly convenient. Strange
to the minds of the ladies most in
terested, the majority of women
preferred to lunch sitting upon
hard seats and breathing the eigh
teenth century air of the lecture
rooms; so that it looked as if the
room would eventually be aban
doned for lack of support.
Early in the present semester
the remnants of the old committee
canvassed the matter anew, with
the result that a room more com
fortable and attractive than was
the room of last year awaits the
inspection, approval, and adoption
of all the University women.
Upon the table is a Student Di
rectory, and the CentuYy, kindly
presented by some friend. We
hope some time to be able to keep
on file the Daily Palo Alto and
Sequoia also.
Already students and visitors
are showing their appreciation of
the room by using it. Yesterday
tifteen young women were collected
there at lunch-time, and though
they overflowed from chairs and
lounges on to the floor, all had a
jolly time together. The possibili
ties of the room as a social center
were strongly emphasized.
