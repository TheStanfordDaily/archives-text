# Christmas Outings.
## 
### 
Those who stay at Encina during
Christmas vacation are forming
parties to take extended tramps,
after the manner of students in
the German universities. Some
will go to Santa Cruz by way of
Spanishtown and Pescadero, while
others are planning to go on the
other side of the bay by Mission
San Jose and further down the Mt.
Hamilton range.
These might follow the methods
of the Outing Club, and make notes
of the best roads, trails, and hotels,
especially if they are on new route√ü.
