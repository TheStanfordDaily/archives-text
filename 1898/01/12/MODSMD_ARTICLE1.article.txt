# PROSPECTS ON THE TRACK.
## Candidates for the '98 Team and the Outlook for the Coming Season. 
### 
At the beginning of the second
semester, the captain and manager
of the track team are looking about
to see what material they have to
work into a team worthy to go
against the redoubtable forces of
U. C. Not only are they interested,
but the whole student body is
wondering what our chances are in
the next field-day. Prospects at
present favor our rivals.
Manager (Gregory has been very
active since his appointment, and
has kept our track in very much
better condition during the past
semester than the track our en
thusiastic antagonists have been
daily crowding with squads of half
a hundred or more men. This is
one point in which the Berkeley
men have excelled at the very be
ginning. For notwithstanding the
earnest entreaties of the captain all
through the past semester and the
invitation which the manager ex
tended in the way of a suitably
prepared track, very few men have
been doing any sort of preliminary
out-door training thus far. This
criticism applies more to the new
men who intend to try for places
on the team for the first time than
to the old men, most of whom have
been doing light work and are in
excellent shape to l>egin the serious
training of the year. Most of the
weight men have played football.
The track is being put into condi
tion now for regular work. The
wooden curb has rotted away in
several spots, and the track is torn
up considerably at these places.
As soon as the curb is renewed the
track will be graded and rolled and
the ends rebanked. Manager Gre
gory is experiencing a great deal of
trouble in trying to obtain a rub
bing-room for the men. Mr. Adder
son is unwilling to allow him to
use a room in Encina, and there is
no other place near the track at all
fitted for the purpose. There is
considerable talk about the advisa
bility and necessity of building a
small house which should contain
cots and baths and be suitably
heated. This would benefit not
only the track athletes but also the
football and baseball teams. Stan
ford has never had either suitable
rubbing arrangements or warm
shower-baths, considered indispen
sable at other places.
Berkeley lias not only almost the
entire team of last year with some
notable additions, but also the
same efficient trainer, captain, and
manager. Stanford men, however,
with W. McLeod, football trainer,
to look after them, and Brunton
and Oregory as captain and mana
ger, have no reason to be envious.
There is one thing which Berke
ley must battle against this year,
which we in all probability will be
spared—it is fatal over-confidence.
The spirit which animates all the
veterans of the Stanford cinder
path is admirable, and the one that
will bring victory at last to our
abode, if she should ever be fickle
enough to tire of her resting place
for so long on the variegated ban
ners of the enemy. Not many of
our men are talking, but nearly

every one lias treasured up in his
heart the name of a man of the Un
iversity of California, and there is
indelibly stamped upon his mem
ory a moment of agony, when that
man struggled past him, and the
U. C. crowd shouted, and the blue
and gold was flaunted over the
cardinal. These men will work,
and if their spirit can be infused
into the minds of the new men,
who put on spikes for the first time
for Stanford this year, we have the
making of a team that may do the
impossible —according to Berkeley.
For as the Berkeley Evening World
says:"The only thing in the way
of an Eastern jaunt is a defeat in
the field-day with Stanford, and
that is not admitted to be possible."
As the II r orld says further on in a
different connection: "So when
their fond dream is dispelled, they
are likely to roar and smash things."
Their fond dream will not be dis
pelled though, without hard work
on the part of every man in the
Stanford squad. Victory can be
purchased only at the price of un
remitting, conscientious work from
now until the field-day.
Freshmen this year have been
unusually reticent and hesitating
about becoming track candidates.
Among them the Daily Palo Alto
representative has learned of the
following: For sprints, Weather
wax is said to be a promising can
didate. Brunton and Birch are
old men. For the quarter-mile run,
beside Karsted and Diggles of last
year's team, Strout, '01, is a candi
pate. He will also try the half
mile. Jackson and Simons, both
freshmen, are also mentioned. For
the longer runs there are a number
of promising men beside the old
men: Walker, Smith, Williams, and
Daggett. Oilman, '99, who was
laid up by a weak ankle last year,
will be out again thisseason. Dane
Coolidge is trying to develop en
durance and if he succeeds his
sprinting ability will make him a
good distance runner. Erb, cap
tain of the second eleven, has had
considerable experience and is
strong and gritty. Wardall, the
freshman halfback, is a candidate.
Steele, '01, and Potter,'ol, have had
some experience. Ralph Arnold
and Van Anderson are not fresh
men, but are new men on the track.
Chris Bradley has also been train
ing. Among the walkers Paul
Adams has not been on the track
this year, but has kept in training.
Dolph, J. H. Stewart, Lousley, and
Bryan, all freshmen, will be on the
track practicing this event.
The jumps besides Dole are Hop
per and Boyd, who were unfortun
ately sick last year after doing good
work, and Sloane, '01. In the pole
vault Dole is champion, and Boyd
and Mclntyre, '00, are candi
dates. In the weights are
Fickert, Carle, Fisher, Burnett.
Oilman, '01, may do good work in
these events. Murphy will ride
the bicycle again this year. Saver,
'98, is in training for the bicycle
race and will probably do better
this year than he was doing last
yesir when a broken collar-bone
put a stop to his training. Marvin,
Jones, and Bradley, freshmen with
more or less experience, will also
train for the wheel event.
