The musical clubs will arrive on
the campus tomorrow, the last date
on the itinerary being at Stockton
tonight. We have not heard from
the clubs directly and all our in
formation lias been gleaned from
our exchanges. From these it is
apparent that the tour has been a
decided success socially, and it
seems also financially. It is
understood that for the first few
days they lost money, but up to the
last we could learn of them they
were still gaining. The Chronicle
report from Pomona dated Janu
ary 8 states that at that place the
clubs had made $600 over expenses,
having been on the road ten days.
