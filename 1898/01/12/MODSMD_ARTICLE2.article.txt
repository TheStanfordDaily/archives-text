# CHANGES IN THE FACULTY.
## Now Instructors Added to Several Departments of the University. 
### 
There are very few changes in
the faculty this semester, and very
few changes have been made in the
schedule of courses. Professors
Lindgren and Durand, the notable
additions to the faculty, have ar
rived and have taken charge of
their classes.
Professor E. Dana Durand has
been added to the Economics de
partment of the University, and
will act as assistant professorof Ad
ministration and Finance. Profes
sor Durand was graduated from
Oberlin College, Ohio, in 1893, and
then spent three years in the social
science department of Cornell Uni
versity. He then became librarian
of the legislative branch of the New
York State Library at Albany,
which position he held until last
spring when he was engaged by
President Jordan, when he went to
Berlin for study preparatory to as
suming his duties at Stanford.
Professor Durand is also a writer
of some note, having contributed
numerous articles to magazines on
the results of legislation in the
United States, and is also the
author of a work on "Finances of
New York."
Professor Durand is considered
an expert on legislation and its ef
fects, and his work here will deal
with that phase of economics. He
will offer two courses, "Politics and
Administration" and "Money and
Banking." "Politics and Adminis
tration" will deal with the practi
cal methods and workings of gov
ernment in the United States, with
some • comparison with European
systems. Bryce's "American Com
monwealth," Wilson's "The State,"
and Lowell's "Parties and Oovern
ments in Continental Europe" will
be read. "Money and Banking"
will deal chiefly with the practical
side of the money question, prime
consideration being given to the sil
ver question. Professor Durand
will not be able to give the course
in "Finance" scheduled for this
semester, as his time will be occu
pied, in addition to his regular
work,in co-operating with Professor
Ross in giving Economics I.
With Professor Durand's aid in
giving Economics I, Professor Ross
will be able to remain at the Uni
versity. Overwork last semester

it was feared that he would be com
pelled to give up his classes this

States the year of his graduation
and was immediately appointed
geologist of the Northern Pacific

railway. He was also engaged for
a time in the smelting business at
Helena, Montana, and since 1885
has been an assistant in the United
States Geological survey. Two lec
