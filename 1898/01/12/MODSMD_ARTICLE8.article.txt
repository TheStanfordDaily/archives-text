With this issue the Daily Palo
Alto begins its twelfth volume.
The successful completion of the
eleven other volumes and the rank
of this paper among the other col
lege dailies of the United states is
sufficient testimony to the wisdom
and energy of the founders anil the
earnest labors of the former editors.
The editorial policy of the paper
will remain unchanged, inasmuch
as the former editors have endeav
ored to make the paper representa
tive of the student body of Stanford
University and to conduct it in the
interest of Stanford students. The
present board of editors is new and
untried, and in the endeavor to
represent the student body and to
reflect student opinion requests the
support and co-operation of both
students and members of the fac
ulty. Without it a voluntary staff,
such as that of the Daily Palo
Alto, can not hope to succeed.
