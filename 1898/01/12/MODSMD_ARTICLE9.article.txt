Stanford's track policy this year
promises to he active and energttic
for the reason that the management
is characterized by those qualities
that go so far towards building up
a successful team. Stanford's man
agers and captains of athletic teams
have always worked for their teams
with determination and enthusiasm,
and their greatest difficulties have
been in infusing their spirit into
the college and the members of the
teams. Upon this much depends.
The reason that' Stanford has not

won victories on the track similar
ito those on the gridiron may l>e
i found in the attitude of the stu
dents toward track athletics. In
football we have learned the lesson
of how to win victories. We have
j enthusiasm among the students,
plenty of candidates for the team,
1 and the sturdy devotion of the sec
j ond eleven men. On the track
j each year we have relied upon men
of tried ability to bring home vic
tory.
What is needed to make our
track policy a winning one is more
Candidates each year and the adop
tion of the "second eleven" policy
of the football team. If every year
forty freshmen practiced faithfully
on the track and continued train
ing for at least two years, the re
sult would he a strong reserve from
which to draw for Varsity men.
This is substantially the policy of
the University of California, and
the list of defeats Stanford has ex
perienced proves its wisdom. In
dications are that a larger number
of men will try for the team, but
the timidity of the freshmen in com
ing forward must be overcome. A
step in this direction would be to
revive the Sophomore-Freshman
meet on the track. A meet such
as this would, through the medium
of class spirit, lend to stimulate in
terest in track work among the
lower-classmen, which is at present
the weak point of our track system.
