# RETURN OF THE CLUBS.
## Musical Men Return from a Successful Trip South With $100 to Their Credit. 
### 
The musical clubs returned this
afternoon from their Southern trip
singing and in good spirits, it was
a happy crowd that tumbled out of
the fiver at Menlo Park and
crowded into the buses, for they
have just completed the longest and
most successful tour on record at
Stanford. And more than this,
they have come out of it not only
even financially, but, incredible as
it may seem, $100 ahead. In twenty
two days they have given twenty
concerts, three of them being on
Sundays. Twenty-six men made
the trip. Nobody was sick and
all declare that they return in bet
ter shape than they left.
Everywhere they have kept in
mind that they were representing
Stanford and everywhere they have
created a good impression, as the
press notices testify. They have
been entertained by the most prom
inent society people in the different
places visited, being guests in the
homes of various friends at Los
Angeles, Pasadena, San Diego,
Santa Barbara, and Riverside. At
other places the clubs stopped at
the best hotels.
Too much credit can not be given
Stanford graduates who lent their
enthusiastic aid at all stopping
places to make the concerts success
ful in every way possible.
All the men unite in praising the
vigorous, business-like work of Ad
vance Agent Morrison and Trea
surer Porneroy, and say that they
principally are responsible for the
financial success of the trip. When
it is remembered that two years ago
the clubs made a Southern trip and
returned $600 behind and that hist
year they lost nearly as much, it is
plain that their praise is merited.
The manager of the clubs, W. C.
McNeil, has also proved his ability
on the trip.
At nearly every town on the
route which has a high school con
certs were given for the pupils,
which must place Stanford in a
favorable light before them. On
Tuesday, the fourth of this month,
they gave a concert in the after
noon before the Normal School stu
dents in Los Angeles.
The concerts given by the clubs
were of a high order, and at Cor
onado where there was a large num
ber of Eastern people in the aud
ience and at other places where
there were people who have heard
the glee and mandolin clubs of
Eastern universities, the boys were
told that their work Was of as good
a quality as that of the large East
ern colleges. A serenade by Phil.
Abbott, president of the clubs, was
received with especially enthusias
tic applause everywhere An ar
rangement of "Palm Branches" in
which both clubs appeared was ef
fective. Of course Dillon and
Riley received numerous encores at
every appearance. Los Angeles
was the Star house and nearly $600
was taken in there. But there
were packed halls everywhere.
The trip was a success in every
way and the best on record, and the
boys had a right to give the yell
with the vim they did all along the

journey home und when they
reached the quad.
A representative of the Daily
Palo Alto met the clubs at Menlo
Park, and gathered the above facts,
hut owing to the lateness which ne
cessitated hurried work, the ac
count is incomplete and a fuller
one will appear in tomorrow's issue.
