We wish to cull especial atten
tion to Captain Brunton's notices
to track men in the issues of the
Daily Palo Alto of yesterday and
today. He wants to meet every
man who intends to make use of
the track this semester, whether lie
hopes to make the team or not.
Each candidate should make an
effort to he present at the meeting,
and if unable to do so he should see
the captain or manager personally.
Several matters of great importance
will be discussed, but the meeting
will be ineffective unless all the
men are there.
