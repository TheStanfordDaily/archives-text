The urgent notices that have ap
peared in these columns for the
meeting of the Junior Class tomor
row should not fail to appeal to
every member of the class and re
sult in a large attendance. The
notices, we have learned, are in re
gard to the class assessment for the
support of the '99 Annual. Com
plaint has been made on every hand
of the passive attitude of the Jun
ior classmen toward the book which
they have desired to be published.
They did desire to have the book
published or they never would have
elected men for the work. The
election of competent men, however,
is not the only requisite for so
large a task. This was also con
ceded by the Juniors when they
levied an assessment. But to levy
an assessment is mockery if it is
not paid. Money is a sina
non, and if the Juniors desire a
book, they must back their good
intentions as they promised.
The Juniors have as good editor
ial and artistic ability as any class
that has ever been in the Univer
sity. They are men ready to give
their time and talent to the work
for which they have been elected
and appointed. Hut their work is
of no avail if there is to be no re
sult, and under the present circum
stances there can be none. The
class can not expect an editor and
a business manager to issue a book.
They have admitted that they do

not expect it, but that is us fur as
most of them have gone.
These are plain facts for the mem
bers of '99 to digest, and we make
no apology for them because tliey
are facts. Let every member of the
class recognize the emergency that
exists and at least attend the meet
ing to determine what is to be done.
Whatever action is taken must be
taken immediately.
