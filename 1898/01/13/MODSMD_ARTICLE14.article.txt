# Vacation on the Campus
## 
### 
A greater number of students
than is usual spent the Christmas
holidays away from the University.
For those who remained the three
weeks intermission was long .but
not uneventful.
The event of the vacation was
the dinner and smoker given at the
Beta Theta Pi house Christmas eve.
The dinner was gotten up much
after the old New England style,
the chief topi of discussion being a
roast pig. The large and elegant
home of the Beta Theta Pi was
tastefully decorated for the occasion
with mistletoe, greens, and potted
plants. After the dinner had been
disposed of and capped by a num
ber of good stories, Master of Cer
emonies Switzer announced a
Christmas tree in the parlor, on
which each of the twenty-live
guests had placed something for
someone else. The presents were
the cause of much good humor.
The latter part of the evening was
taken up with songs and a stag
dance. Those present were: Irwin,
'98; Switzer, '1)8; Dole, '98; Cool
idge, '98; Carle, '1)8; Decker, '98;
