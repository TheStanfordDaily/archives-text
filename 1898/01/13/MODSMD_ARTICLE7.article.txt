# BASEBALL OUTLOOK.
## Candidates are Numerous and Prospects for a Strong Nine are Very Bright. 
### 
Never before have there been so
many candidates for baseball hon
ors as this year. Every position
will be sharply contested. Even
pitcher, over which there was such
a half-hearted fight last season, will
be struggled for by half a score or
more.
Up to the present time the fol
lowing names have been handed to
Manager lveesling as candidates for
the pitcher position: Hill, '98,
Bush, '98, Lanagan, '00, Beckett,
'00, Boyd, '00, Lougheed, '00, Coc
head, '00, \V rig ley, '01, Edwards,
'01, Russ, '01, Lawrence. '01,
O'Hara, '01, Ray, '01, and Havens,
'01. The work of llill, Lanagan,
and Beckett is best known. Among
the freshmen there is said to be
some of the stuff that twirlers are
made of. Edwards comes from
San Diego with an excellent repu
tation. Wrigley, who hails from
Minnesota, has been showing up
well. He is so expert with either
hand that nearly every one knows
him by the name of the ambidex
trous pitcher. Boyd is also a
promising aspirant. Of the others
little is known. It would not be
surprising, however, if from among
them several dark horses would
come to the front.
In the event that Captain Jeffs'
football injury should prevent him
from playing, the place will by no
means go begging. The strongest
candidates for the place behind the
bat would then be 0 Sirohn and
Swindells, '01, late captain of the
Tacoma Athletic Club team. Jevne,
Pond, Toll, and Bentley are also in
the list for this position.
Other players who will try for
the team are R. Strohn, Chester
Murphy, E. E. Morgan, P. R.
Smith, Daly, Van Kaathoven, War
dall, Pioher, Potter, Francis, P. Wil
son, L. Chandler, Waite, Crandall,
Gregory, Weils, Hawley, Corbusier,
Roberts, Higley, Bank head, Bacher,
Dudley, Diviny, and Asmuesen.
The list is not yet complete.
Of last year's team six men are
back: Jeffs, Beckett, Strohn, Loug
heed, Klauber, and Wight. Jeffs
is at present laid up with his knee;
Beckett is keeping his arm in by
pitching a little; Strohn, Lougheed,
Wight, and Klauber are in their
old-time form. it is said that
Manager McGlinn of the Olympics
made Lougheed tempting offers to
secure him for his team. In the
return to college of W. T. Young,
'98, and Stanley Harris, '00, two of
Stanford's best-known players, the
outlook is made even more cheerful.
Captain Jeffs' main object will
be to develop a strong batting team.
Should new men show more skill
in handling the stick than the old
men places will be made for them
on the team at once. If diligent
practice will remedy the fatal de
fect which last year's team showed
in batting, Captain Jeffs is deter
mined to turn out a team of hard
and heady hitters.
The team will have no regular
coach this year. A number of the
graduates who starred on the dia
mond while in college have con

seated to give what time they can
to coaching the players. Hilly
McLaine, Jack Sheehan, Billy Har
relson, and Hugh Dyer will be
down from time to time to give the
men the benefit of their experience.
The work of the graduate coaches
has always been productive of ex
cellent results at Stanford. The
old players know their business,
are personally popular, and have
the confidence of those whom they
assist. By this scheme, Stanford's
old athletes are brought in closer
contact with their college and a
more healthy athletic spirit is de
veloped .
The Stanford management is
anxious to have a live-game tourna
ment concluded. The games would
then be played at Recreation Park
and one game on each campus.
Berkeley, however, is not so well
satisfied with this plan, for some
unknown reason. Manager Kees
ling received a challenge this morn
ing from the University of Nevada
team, which is desirous of crossing
bats with the Stanford men. It is
quite possible that a game will be
arranged with the Reno nine.
Santa Clara College baseball nine
has reorganized for the coming sea
son with Thomas Robinson man
ager. Tom Kelly has been chosen
captain. .Joe Corbett, the crack
Baltimore pitcher, has been secured
to coach the team. The Stanford
nine will probably be able to get
excellent practice by games with
this team.
The diamond will be put in shape
immediately and all arrangements
made for early practice. Sand will
be worked into the soil to absorb the
water. Care, however, will be
taken to keep the field from becom
ing slow.
