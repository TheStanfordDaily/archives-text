The attention of the '99 Class is
called to the appointment of col
lectors for the Annual assessment
announced in this issue. As it is
necessary to get the deposit money
in as soon as possible, every Junior
who has heretofore been indifferent
or has not had an opportunity to
pay the assessment should make
the work of the collectors as easy
as possible by a quick response.
The assessment must be paid be
fore the editors can put any copy
in the hands of the printer, and
now that the class has decided a
second time that they wish to issue
the Annual, there should be no
further delay in backing the propo
sition financially. The Junior
Class is now in a position where it
must act, and act quickly, and every
patriotic man and woman in the
class must come forward with their
support or the class will fail where
not one has failed before and, in all
probability, none will ever fail
again.
