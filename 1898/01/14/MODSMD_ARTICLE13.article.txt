### 
Upon the death of the Rev.
Robert B. Peet during the Christ
mas holidays the faculty sent the
following expression of sympathy j
to the widow in behalf of the fae-1
ulty and students of the University: i
Mrs. 11. li. I'cet, San Francisco:
Dear Madam:—On behalf of the I
Faculty of Lei and Stanford Jr.
University, we respectfully beg to
assure you of our keen sense of the
loss which this University has sus
tained in the death of your deeply J
lamented husband. For the last j
few years Mr. Peet had so closely)
associated himself with the welfare
of this community that in losiug
him we realize that we have parted
with one whose noble manliness,
beautiful gentleness, and warmth
of sympathy for others, combined
to form a character which was a
constant inspiration to all with
whom lie came in contact.
No one among us was more sin
cerely respected and loved by all
kinds and conditions of men, young
and old, rich and poor, learned and
unlearned. Especially dear was he
to a large number >112 our students,
who now sincerely mourn his loss.
Indeed, his genuine interest in the
students, individually and collect
ively, and his sympathetic appre
ciation of the aims of this institu
tion have been of great value to the
University ollicers in the manage
ment of students' affairs. His
broad, liberal views, his sweet
reasonableness and Christian char
ity, together with a single-hearted
devotion to high ideals, enabled
him to exert in this community an
influence for good, which we con
fidently believe will endure for
many years to come.
With renewed assurances of the
deep obligations under which we
stood to your husband, and of the
genuine esteem in which he was
held by all, we are,
Respectfully yours,
[Signed] David S. Jordan,
