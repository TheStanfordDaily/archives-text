# The 						Clubs' Trip.
## 
### 
The return of the musical clubs
late yesterday afternoon completed
the most successful trip ever taken
by the Stanford clubs. In every
particular the outcome was most
satisfactory to the members. Soci
ally the trip was most enjoyable,
the clubs being everywhere re
ceived with the greatest favor, and
everywhere the members merited
the kind reception. The fact also
that the personal notes of twenty
five dollars each, which the club
men deposited with Treasurer Pome
roy before leaving, were in no dan
ger of being used to make up a de
ficit, also added much to the enjoy
ment of the trip.
The greatest credit for the suc
cess of the trip is given by the
management and by every mem
ber of the clubs to the untiring ef
forts of Advanoe Agent Morrison.
Mr. Morrison's reputation as one
of the best business men ever grad
uated from Stanford did not suffer
during the trip. With no personal
remuneration for his duties, he
worked unceasingly for the inter
ests of the clubs, and it was due to
his energy that, instead of return
ing with a large deficit as usual,
the clubs now have a small bal
ance to their credit. Morrison
made good contracts with the thea
ters, placed his advertising to the

best advantage, and sowed the
whole South with press notices.
The whole management went off
without a hitch, and there never
was more harmony. Treasurer
Pomeroy and Managers McNeil
and Sladen also deserve credit for
their work on the trip.
The clubs were given dances in
almost every town they visited.
At Santa Barbara the clubs were
given a fine ball by Miss Main, '98,
and Miss Colt, '97. The morning
after the concert they were taken
over the city on a tally-ho by Clar
ence Day, '01. At Pasadena the
boys report one of the finest times
of the trip. The clubs arrived
there on December 29, and after an
enthusiastic reception at the con
cert, were tendered a ball by the
Valley Hunt Club. Credit for the
success of the concert and their
pleasant time in Pasadena is given
to Dagget, '00, Page, '99, and
McGillivray, ex-'OO. From Pasa
dena the clubs jumped to San Di
ego, where they were given a very
fine ball by the Florence Heights
Club at Florence Hotel after the
concert. December 31 the boys
performed at the Coronado Hotel
before a large audience of Eastern
guests. The work of the clubs re
ceived the greatest praise from peo
ple who were familiar with the
work of Eastern clubs. A Har

vard man praised the work of the
Mandolin Club especially, saying
that its work was superior to that
of Urge Eastern clubs, and the
Glee Club was regarded with al
most equal favor.
By way of diversion at San Diego
a baseball game was played with
the Operas, the champion nine of
the vicinity. Only five innings
were played, and the Stanford team
lost by a score of 8 to 2.
Arriving at Los Angeles on Sun
day, Jan. 2, the clubs were enter
tained at prominent homes in the
city, and the day was spent in rest
and sight-seeing. Monday morn
ing the clubs sang at the high
school, and in the afternoon were
tendered a reception at the Marl
borough School, where the young
society set of the city was present.
The concert of the evening was the
most brilliant of the tour and the
audience the most appreciative.
Tuesday afternoon the clubs per
formed at the Normal School be
fore five hundred students.
At Santa Monica Tuesday even
ing the clubs were the guests of
Mrs. John P. Jones, wife of United
States Senator Jones of Nevada, at
her palatial residence, and after the
concert a pleasant reception took
place.
At Riverside there was more col
lege spirit and the cardinal was
everywhere in evidence. At San
Bernardino the clubs had the next
largest house, and the program was
trebled on account of the frequent
encores. The concert was under
the auspices of the Websters, a lit
erary and social club of the city,
and the usual reception took place.
Bledsoe, '96, and Foy, ex-'9B, did
good work for the clubs.
The last Sunday on the trip was
spent on the train between Pomona
and Bakersfield. Sundays were
spent in rest and no concerts were
given as was announced in yester
day's paper.
Dillon and Riley were the favor
ites of every audience and they cre
ated a good impression at every
town. Riley's monologues always
made hits. Strohn's buck dance,
"Black America," ''Under the
Double Eagle, " and " Palm
Branches " by the Mandolin Club,
"Dear Old Stanford " and "Jenk's
Compound" by the Glee Club, Ab
bott's Serenade, and the double
work of Dillon and Riley were the
favorite pieces on the program.
