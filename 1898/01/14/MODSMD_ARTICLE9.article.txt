The successful return of the
musical clubs is a source of grati
fication to every one interested in
student affairs, as well as a justifi
cation of the present system of stu
dent body management of the clubs.
The management this year has
been efficient and capable, and the
harmonious working of the system
of student body control speaks well
for both the clubs themselves and
the student body officials. The
laurels also that the clubs bring
back, and the praise which they re
ceived everywhere for the character
of their concerts, and also for the
gentlemanly bearing of the mem
bers, reflect great credit on the mus
ical men and also upon the student
body of Stanford that sent out such
organizations.
