# "THE HUMAN REACTION."
## First University S rmon of the Semester Delivered by President Jordan. 
### 
Before the sermon yesterday Dr.
Thoburn spoke of the Chapel
Union and its need of the co-opera
tion of it 11 people in its different
lines of activity, in order to make
it the center of religions life in the
University community.
Dr. Jordan spoke in part as fol
lows:
"Lincoln once said that he would
walk a thousand miles to join a
church which believed in God and
humanity. As a humble member
of some such church, 1 would speak
to you. President White once said
of his great teacher, the chemist,
Benjamin Stillman, 'lie had faith
in truth as truth; faith that there
is a power in the universe good
enough to make truth-telling safe,
and strong enough to make truth
telling effective.'
"Mr. Ingersoll criticised these
words. 'There is no such power,'
said he. 'If truth-telling is safe, it
is because men, not God, respond
to it.' This again is true, but not
the whole truth. If men were not
good at bottom, truth-telling would
not be safe. If they did not have
an instinct for truth, truth-telling
would be vain babbling. If 'truth,
crushed to earth, shall rise again,'
it is man who erects it. "What
God does for man, he does through
men.' The revelations of the
'power outside ourselves that
makes for righteousness' comes to us
from the lives and acts of other
men. The sons of God are incar
nate in human flesh, and as the
good men and the great men of the
world have been a part of our com
mon humanity, men from time to
time have worshipped humanity as
God.
''But with all this, men have
never been content to worship hu
manity as God. They recognize a
larger responsibility than that of
man. Does he who can not make
one hair white or black claim the
authorship of the universe? We
can not worship man except by
looking beyond man to the power
of which all human wisdom and
goodness is but a manifestation.
Man can not worship himself. He
knows that whatever he does of
goodness or wisdom was good or
wise before he did it; that good or
wise action on his part is but fall
ing in line with the great tenden
cies and purposes in the universe,
which existed before man. and by
virtue of which man came to exist.
It is not the work of humanity but
of God in humanity,and this only
can man worship.
"Men are slow to recognize thai
nature has her own laws and pur
poses. She is not the executor of
human justice. When the tower
of Silonm fell, did it fall because
those under it were wicked above
all other men? 'I tell you nay';
nor was it on account of their evil
lives that the blood of the Gali
leans was mixed with the sacrifices.
''God always deals with us in
kind. Of the same nature as the
accident is its reward or its penalty.
Their nature is explained in the
parable of the talents. Whoever

is happy and helpful shall find his!
happinesßand helpfulness increased
ten-fold. Whoever does nothing
with his power shall lose that which
he hath. Of like nature are God's
punishments. Not in the earth
quake and the storm does God exe
cute vengeance on the wicked.
"God consents, but only fora time,'
and the evil gives place to thegood,
weakness to strength. God's pen
alties are self-inflicted, for the forces
that punish sin are innate in the
heart of man. Everyman carries
in his own breast the key to his
own heaven and his own hell.
''Many men have been distressed
over the insensibility of nature. She
goes on with her own affairs. When
the boat overturns she drowns a
prophet as she would a rat. The
stones on the street ought to have
cried out at the murder of Caesar.
Hut they did not. Only men can
do this. Nature attends only to
her own affairs. She is only our
impersonation of her own affairs.
She can not vary. A varying mul
tiplication table would be the de
struction of mathematics. A vary
ing law of nature would be the de
struction of the universe. But a
law of ethics is no more sacred, no
more or less invariable, than the
law of rain. A law of nature is the
expression of the wisest, the best,
the only way of doing things. Such
a law was never broken, can never
be broken, for nothing in the uni
verse will ever he done in an in
ferior way. If it were so done, if
any effect should follow the wrong
cause; if to please you and me, two
times two should be live; if to save
all the crops in the world, rain
should come when rain was impos
sible; this would be the that
man, not God, ruled the universe.
With him in place of law, even for
a moment, 'the whole universe
would shrivel up like a cast-off
snake-skin.'

"Much of human misery comes
from the belief that 'nature owes us
a living,' that somehow or other she
ought to make an exception in our
favor. People think that nature
will ease up somehow or other in
their case. Man projects his little
egoism out on the face of nature.
He is in secret alliance with the
heart of the universe. He has
friends at court that give him im
munity, whatever his misdeeds.
"The feeling that nature must
perforce take a part in human af
fairs for good or evil is the basis of
that which Ruskin has called 'the
patheticfallacy.' By 'the pathetic
fallacy,' one ascribes to nature the
motives for action which our rela
tions to her suggest. She neither
loves nor hates. She is neither
good nor cruel. She is merely the
truth of God —the God of the things
as they are, which is the only God
we know or can worship. It is
within ourselves and our relations
that the good and evil find their
place.
"Prayer is the expression of what
may be called the'human reaction.'
Gravitation constantly pulls us
towards the ground. As with the
other laws of nature, its purpose is
cosmic order. In its direct influ
ence it would bring us to rest prone
upon the ground. But it is this
same law that causes man to walk
upright. The human reaction
causes him to resist gravitation,
while co-operating with it. He
stands erect in opposition to this
force which would overthrow him.
Were it not for the force he would
not make the resistance. The law
of gravitation is indifferent. It
will insist that the line of direction
must fall within the base when
man would stand, and no man, or
tower, or temple, or pyramid ever
stood upon any other terms.
"Natural law is true and just,
