### 
''Billy" McLeod, who success
fully trained last year's football
team, began work with the track
men today. His experience here
tofore has been mainly with track
men, and that, combined with his
knowledge of our climatic condi
tions, should augur well for his
success this spring. For the pres
ent no heavy rubbing will be given
any of the men, but those who feel
stiff or sore during the first few
days will receive most of his at
tention.
The number of men who met
Captain Brunton on Friday after
noon augurs well for Stanford on
the track this year. There was a
gratifying number of new men, and
although none are sporting their
records, all seem to be capable of
good work and willing to train
faithfully.
Captain Brunton told the men
what he expected of them and out
lined the plan of training to be
followed. As there is to be no
trainer for the team this year the
men with the most experience in
each department will give the new
men all the help in their power.
Regular training will begin today.

those who have charge of the differ
