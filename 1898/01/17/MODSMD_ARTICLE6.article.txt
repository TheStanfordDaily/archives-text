Trainer McLeod's arrival marks
the beginning of work for the track
team, and the fact that the team is
in charge of such an active and ex
perienced man is the cause of much
congratulation among track enthu
siasts. No I tetter man ever trained
the football team and the same
may be said this year regarding
the track men.
