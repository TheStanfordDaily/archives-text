At the very beginning of the se
mester some attention may be called
to the selfishness of a class of stu
dents at University chapel exercises
and lectures. Our chapel is not
large enough to accommodate every
one desirous of attending upon occa
sions of more than ordinary inter
est, and for this reason the extreme
selfishness of those who monopolize
extra room by spreading their
wraps over extra seats or by reserv
ing for friends seats in the center of
the rows, is made even more mani
fest. Students have no right to ex
clude others from their privileges
by their carelessness, and it is very
annoying to know that the seating
capacity of the chapel is not fully
used when there are great num
bers eager to obtain even standing
room. Students should be careful
not to monopolize more than the
seats to which thev are entitled.
