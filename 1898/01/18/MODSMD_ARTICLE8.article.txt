In this iKHiie we publish cuts of
the three Varsity captains of 1898.
Three better men never led Stan
ford forces, and with these men at
the head of the three most impor
tant branches of athletics every one
may be assured that if possible by
clean, hard, sportsmanlike work,
victory will be brought home to
Stanford. The football captain
must labor to preserve our un
broken list of victories on the grid
iron, the baseball captain to re
trieve the defeat of last year, and
the track captain to win, what
never has yet been won, a victory
in track athletics. With these men
for leaders, strong support from
the college should accomplish these
ends.
