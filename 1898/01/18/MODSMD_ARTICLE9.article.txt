Thk training season for track
men opened officially yesterday.
The good showing in the number
of men who turned out for season
ing work is very encouraging
This is generally the case, but
heretofore a great many of the
men have left their work before the
preliminary soreness has disap
peared. The virtue of stick-to-it
iveness is nowhere more needed
than on the track, and every man
who has begun work should culti
vate this quality. Not only this,
but all who have handed their
names to the captain should ap
pear for practice at regular hours.
This is the time when the pre
liminary work for all of the ath
letic and intellectual contests with
Berkeley must be done. A poor
start may mean defeat. Every de
bater and athlete should realize
this and bend every energy to avoid
such an outcome.
