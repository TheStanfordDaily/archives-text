# A 						TRAINING HOUSE.
## Shall the Student Body Build One For Our Athletes? Faculty Men and Prominent Students Speak in Favor of the Proposed Plan. 
### 
The proposal that the student
body erect an athletic training
house is receiving considerable dis
cussion at present in student circles.
Every one seems to lie unanimous
in agreeing that there is a real
need for such a house, and that it
would be of great benefit to the
athletes of all the teams. But all
the details of the proposition have
not yet been thought out, and over
these there are some differences oi
opinion, as well as to the method
of raising the money for the under
taking. The members of the musi
cal clubs have signified willingness
to give a benefit concert on the
campus, and this has given addi
tional impetus to the scheme.
Treasurer Pomeroy, chairman ol
the committee appointed yesterday
to investigate the matter, has called
a meeting for tomorrow at 2 p.m.
in room 11 quad. At this meeting
an endeavor will be made to agree
upon some consistent and harmon
ious plan regarding the proposed
training house. Below we present
interviews gathered from several
members of the faculty and from
prominent students.
Treasurer Pomeroy was inter
viewed this afternoon as to the pro
ject and its relations to the finan
cial condition of the student body.
He said: "The student body is in
a condition which would not, under
a 113' circumstances, warrant a
greater expenditure than $500. At
the end of this year, if the baseball
and track seasons are prosperous,
we shall have a slight surplus,
probably $500, not more. The
student body if it undertakes the
erection of an athletic training
house must raise in the neighbor
hood of $500 eit her by benefits or
by subscriptions. In my opinion
it would be a good plan to give
several benefits during the semester
for the building fund. 1 think the
Glee and Mandolin Clubs will con
sent to assist, and if they do a con
cert on the campus will be given
within two or three weeks for that
purpose. As to the house itself, it
should, in my opinion, be a train
ing house, pure and simple, and
should cost between $1000 and
$1200. Jn the house there should
be baths and showers, a drying
room, lockers, a living-room for the
trainer, storerooms for the athletic
goods of the managers, and a large
assembly-room with a fireplace, in
which the men could gather to
gether, and which could be fitted
up in a very attractive manner. I
do not think as yet the building
should include a kitchen and din
ing-room fora training table; these
could be added to the building
later."
Dr. Frank Angell, chairman of
the faculty committee on athletics,
always takes an interest in

questions of athletic policy, and
expressed the following view:
"J think that a training house is
one of the greatest wants in an ath
letic way at Stanford, hut I do not
think it advisable to go far into
debt to secure such a house. A
structure that would answer all of
our present needs could he built
for $1,000, in niy opinion. J make
ibis estimate from plans which the
Faculty Athletic Association have
under consideration fora club
bouse on our grounds. It does not
seem to me that we can yet build a
clubhouse with a training table
and quarters for the men during
the training season, but the more
modest training house could be
built with the idea of extension."
John M. tSwitzer, ex-football man
ager said: ''I am of the opinion
that we ought to have a club and
training house for our athletes.
The house, I think, should be first
class in every respect, and the whole
structure put up at the same time.
Of course it would cost us more
money than we now have in the
treasury, but 1 do not think that in
debtedness is an unhealthy condi
tion. The house should be used by
all athletes, and should have equip
ment in the way of a training table
and other necessary complements
to proper training. 1 think the
cost of such a house would come
under $4,000, and it could be paid
for in about two years."
\V. H. Irwin, '98, a former ed
itor of the Daily Palo Alto, ex
pressed the following opinion: "One
of our greatest needs is a training
table and clubhouse to draw ath
letic interests to a common center.
The house, I think, should be of
the best, and should afford every
possible advantage in the way of
training and association of our ath
letes. However, I am not in favor
of building a temporary structure.
If we can not build what we want
now, let us wait until we can, not
forgetting that we must have it. I
do not think it is a bad idea to
contract a debt for such a laudable
purpose. We could doubtless pay
such a debt in two or three years.
It is best always to have some
thing to work for."
Track Manager Gregory is heart
ily in favor of the project, and in
fact is one of those who have helped
to bring the matter before the pub
lic notice. Although suffering from
a severe attack of la. grippe, he gave
out the following statement: "My
plan would be to build a house for
training quarters, costing about
$1,000, in a, central location, so that
it would be equally accessible to
the three fields. It should be built
in such a way that additions could
be made, and should have a large
room with a fireplace, where the
coaches could meet the men, and
which could also be arranged as a
sort of trophy-room. There should
also be rubbing-rooms, bathrooms,
with hot and cold showers. On
the second floor lockers could be
placed where the men could dress,
and also compartments for athletic
supplies. The money could be
raised by voluntary contributions
in addition to appropriations by
the student body. The credit of
the student body is good and the
money could doubtless be borrowed.

A kitchen and dining-room could
be added without much cost, but it
is a question whether this is advis
able, but the expense would be less
at this time.
"An athletic training house at
this time would bring out new men
and also keep them in better con
dition. This year we have not yet
been able to secure a rubbing-room
for the track men, Mr. Adderson
refusing us a room in Encina Hall.
The men need showers, both hot and
cold, and the only facilities we pos
sess are one cold shower in the gym.
and the baths in Encina. The
house would be of more benefit to
track men than any other branch
of athletics, for in track athletics
the work is individual, and the
physical condition of each man
is of the utmost importance. It
would also be of great benefit on
field-days, as the men would have
some place to go between events."
Dr. Wood, head of the Hygiene
department and also a member of
the Faculty Athletic Committee,
spoke as follows: "A clubhouse
could lie utilized to the great ben
efit of athletics. The lirst requi
sites are, of course, good facilities
for bathing, rubbing, and dressing.
A training table, although not a
necessity, would lie a valuable ad
junct. 1 do not think sleeping
apartments in the house would be
necessary, nor do I think it healthy
to encourage the feature of club life
too far. The project is a worthy
one and should not be difficult of
execution. 1 think it is all right to
contract a debt for it, providing the
expense is kept within reasonable
limits, say $2,000."
Ex-Football Captain Cotton said:'
"I will do all that 1 can to help
raise the money for the house. I
think it should be supplied with
every modern convenience, and that
a Glee Club concert would be a
good way to commence to raise the
money."
Baseball Manager Keesling said:
"I am in favor of this project be
cause it will tend to enforce an in
terest in athletics. More men will
get out, and they will train more
systematically for the events. Ath
letic supplies can be kept in a defi
nite place. I think that the house
should be built fora permanent
structure, and should be well
equipped. The money necessary
for its construction may be secured
by subscription, concerts, and econ
omy in other lines of expenditure,"
Football Manager Prichard spoke
in favor of the plan: "I favor the
project, but the building should be
permanent and not temporary. A
building which would serve the
purposes in view should cost not
less than $2,000. As to the method
of raising the money, I should favor
either the student body borrowing
the amount or mortgaging the
building when erected. The plan
is a good one, and under the above
conditions 1 should be in favor of the
student body going in debt for it."
Captain John Brunton was of
the following opinion: "The ath
letic house is without doubt one of
the most pressing needs of the ath
letic interests of the University.
The troubles that we have had in
the way of bathing, rubbing, and
dressing are the strongest recom

mendations for the clubhouse. 1
think that the structure should he
first-class in every particular and
should be used by all of the Uni
versity athletes in their seasons.
The house should not cost over
$2,000 with training table facilities
and all the requisites for association
and training. It would be neces
sary for us to go into debt on the
proposition, but it seems to me
that the advantages are so great
that the matter of a small debt
should not disconcert us."
Schwartz, '99, ex-editor of the
Daily Palo Alto, said: "1 am in
favor of giving our athletes better
quarters and training facilities. 1
object, however, to any plan to
build a club house,which is merely
temporary, believing that we might
better wait until we have sufficient
funds to build a perm a Dent and
substantial structure,or borrow the
additional amount necessary to
erect such a structure this year."
Charles Dole, '98, ex-track cap
tain, thinks the proposition a very
good scheme, and is heartily in
favor of it. lie said: "1 believe
the future of our track athletics de
pends upon its building. If the
finances are not at hand for an
elaborate building, I think $600
could cover all expenses and give
us a building quite suitable in
every detail, although the outlay
of $1,000 on such a clubhouse
would more than repay for itself.
If the money is not in the student
body treasury, subscriptions might
be taken."
President A B. Morgan made the
following statement: "A clubhouse
for athletic purposes is much needed
at Stanford, and especially now be
cause Manager Gregory reports
that he can not secure a rubbing
room at Encina Hall. I would
favor putting up a substantial
structure if we have enough money
on hand. The Executive Commit
tee does not know exactly what
surplus we have, because the treas
urer has not yet presented his re
ports for auditing. However, if we
have any substantial &um on hand
1 think we could put up a building
that would answer all present pur
poses without going in debt, be
cause there is little doubt but that
a considerable sum could be raised
by subscription for such a purpose."

student body going in debt for it."
Captain John Brunton was of
the following opinion: "The ath
letic house is without doubt one of
the most pressing needs of the ath
letic interests of the University.
The troubles that we have had in
the way of bathing, rubbing, and
dressing are the strongest recom

mendations for the clubhouse. 1
think that the structure should he
first-class in every particular and
should be used by all of the Uni
versity athletes in their seasons.
The house should not cost over
$2,000 with training table facilities
and all the requisites for association
and training. It would be neces
sary for us to go into debt on the
proposition, but it seems to me
that the advantages are so great
that the matter of a small debt
should not disconcert us."
Schwartz, '99, ex-editor of the
Daily Palo Alto, said: "1 am in
favor of giving our athletes better
quarters and training facilities. 1
object, however, to any plan to
build a club house,which is merely
temporary, believing that we might
better wait until we have sufficient
funds to build a perm a Dent and
substantial structure,or borrow the
additional amount necessary to
erect such a structure this year."
Charles Dole, '98, ex-track cap
tain, thinks the proposition a very
good scheme, and is heartily in
favor of it. lie said: "1 believe
the future of our track athletics de
pends upon its building. If the
finances are not at hand for an
elaborate building, I think $600
could cover all expenses and give
us a building quite suitable in
every detail, although the outlay
of $1,000 on such a clubhouse
would more than repay for itself.
If the money is not in the student
body treasury, subscriptions might
be taken."
President A B. Morgan made the
following statement: "A clubhouse
for athletic purposes is much needed
at Stanford, and especially now be
cause Manager Gregory reports
that he can not secure a rubbing
room at Encina Hall. I would
favor putting up a substantial
structure if we have enough money
on hand. The Executive Commit
tee does not know exactly what
surplus we have, because the treas
urer has not yet presented his re
ports for auditing. However, if we
have any substantial &um on hand
1 think we could put up a building
that would answer all present pur
poses without going in debt, be
cause there is little doubt but that
a considerable sum could be raised
by subscription for such a purpose."
The proposal that the student
body erect an athletic training
house is receiving considerable dis
cussion at present in student circles.
Every one seems to lie unanimous
in agreeing that there is a real
need for such a house, and that it
would be of great benefit to the
athletes of all the teams. But all
the details of the proposition have
not yet been thought out, and over
these there are some differences oi
opinion, as well as to the method
of raising the money for the under
taking. The members of the musi
cal clubs have signified willingness
to give a benefit concert on the
campus, and this has given addi
tional impetus to the scheme.
Treasurer Pomeroy, chairman ol
the committee appointed yesterday
to investigate the matter, has called
a meeting for tomorrow at 2 p.m.
in room 11 quad. At this meeting
an endeavor will be made to agree
upon some consistent and harmon
ious plan regarding the proposed
training house. Below we present
interviews gathered from several
members of the faculty and from
prominent students.
Treasurer Pomeroy was inter
viewed this afternoon as to the pro
ject and its relations to the finan
cial condition of the student body.
He said: "The student body is in
a condition which would not, under
a 113' circumstances, warrant a
greater expenditure than $500. At
the end of this year, if the baseball
and track seasons are prosperous,
we shall have a slight surplus,
probably $500, not more. The
student body if it undertakes the
erection of an athletic training
house must raise in the neighbor
hood of $500 eit her by benefits or
by subscriptions. In my opinion
it would be a good plan to give
several benefits during the semester
for the building fund. 1 think the
Glee and Mandolin Clubs will con
sent to assist, and if they do a con
cert on the campus will be given
within two or three weeks for that
purpose. As to the house itself, it
should, in my opinion, be a train
ing house, pure and simple, and
should cost between $1000 and
$1200. Jn the house there should
be baths and showers, a drying
room, lockers, a living-room for the
trainer, storerooms for the athletic
goods of the managers, and a large
assembly-room with a fireplace, in
which the men could gather to
gether, and which could be fitted
up in a very attractive manner. I
do not think as yet the building
should include a kitchen and din
ing-room fora training table; these
could be added to the building
later."
Dr. Frank Angell, chairman of
the faculty committee on athletics,
always takes an interest in

questions of athletic policy, and
expressed the following view:
"J think that a training house is
one of the greatest wants in an ath
letic way at Stanford, hut I do not
think it advisable to go far into
debt to secure such a house. A
structure that would answer all of
our present needs could he built
for $1,000, in niy opinion. J make
ibis estimate from plans which the
Faculty Athletic Association have
under consideration fora club
bouse on our grounds. It does not
seem to me that we can yet build a
clubhouse with a training table
and quarters for the men during
the training season, but the more
modest training house could be
built with the idea of extension."
John M. tSwitzer, ex-football man
ager said: ''I am of the opinion
that we ought to have a club and
training house for our athletes.
The house, I think, should be first
class in every respect, and the whole
structure put up at the same time.
Of course it would cost us more
money than we now have in the
treasury, but 1 do not think that in
debtedness is an unhealthy condi
tion. The house should be used by
all athletes, and should have equip
ment in the way of a training table
and other necessary complements
to proper training. 1 think the
cost of such a house would come
under $4,000, and it could be paid
for in about two years."
\V. H. Irwin, '98, a former ed
itor of the Daily Palo Alto, ex
pressed the following opinion: "One
of our greatest needs is a training
table and clubhouse to draw ath
letic interests to a common center.
The house, I think, should be of
the best, and should afford every
possible advantage in the way of
training and association of our ath
letes. However, I am not in favor
of building a temporary structure.
If we can not build what we want
now, let us wait until we can, not
forgetting that we must have it. I
do not think it is a bad idea to
contract a debt for such a laudable
purpose. We could doubtless pay
such a debt in two or three years.
It is best always to have some
thing to work for."
Track Manager Gregory is heart
ily in favor of the project, and in
fact is one of those who have helped
to bring the matter before the pub
lic notice. Although suffering from
a severe attack of la. grippe, he gave
out the following statement: "My
plan would be to build a house for
training quarters, costing about
$1,000, in a, central location, so that
it would be equally accessible to
the three fields. It should be built
in such a way that additions could
be made, and should have a large
room with a fireplace, where the
coaches could meet the men, and
which could also be arranged as a
sort of trophy-room. There should
also be rubbing-rooms, bathrooms,
with hot and cold showers. On
the second floor lockers could be
placed where the men could dress,
and also compartments for athletic
supplies. The money could be
raised by voluntary contributions
in addition to appropriations by
the student body. The credit of
the student body is good and the
money could doubtless be borrowed.

A kitchen and dining-room could
be added without much cost, but it
is a question whether this is advis
able, but the expense would be less
at this time.
"An athletic training house at
this time would bring out new men
and also keep them in better con
dition. This year we have not yet
been able to secure a rubbing-room
for the track men, Mr. Adderson
refusing us a room in Encina Hall.
The men need showers, both hot and
cold, and the only facilities we pos
sess are one cold shower in the gym.
and the baths in Encina. The
house would be of more benefit to
track men than any other branch
of athletics, for in track athletics
the work is individual, and the
physical condition of each man
is of the utmost importance. It
would also be of great benefit on
field-days, as the men would have
some place to go between events."
Dr. Wood, head of the Hygiene
department and also a member of
the Faculty Athletic Committee,
spoke as follows: "A clubhouse
could lie utilized to the great ben
efit of athletics. The lirst requi
sites are, of course, good facilities
for bathing, rubbing, and dressing.
A training table, although not a
necessity, would lie a valuable ad
junct. 1 do not think sleeping
apartments in the house would be
necessary, nor do I think it healthy
to encourage the feature of club life
too far. The project is a worthy
one and should not be difficult of
execution. 1 think it is all right to
contract a debt for it, providing the
expense is kept within reasonable
limits, say $2,000."
Ex-Football Captain Cotton said:'
"I will do all that 1 can to help
raise the money for the house. I
think it should be supplied with
every modern convenience, and that
a Glee Club concert would be a
good way to commence to raise the
money."
Baseball Manager Keesling said:
"I am in favor of this project be
cause it will tend to enforce an in
terest in athletics. More men will
get out, and they will train more
systematically for the events. Ath
letic supplies can be kept in a defi
nite place. I think that the house
should be built fora permanent
structure, and should be well
equipped. The money necessary
for its construction may be secured
by subscription, concerts, and econ
omy in other lines of expenditure,"
Football Manager Prichard spoke
in favor of the plan: "I favor the
project, but the building should be
permanent and not temporary. A
building which would serve the
purposes in view should cost not
less than $2,000. As to the method
of raising the money, I should favor
either the student body borrowing
the amount or mortgaging the
building when erected. The plan
is a good one, and under the above
conditions 1 should be in favor of the
student body going in debt for it."
Captain John Brunton was of
