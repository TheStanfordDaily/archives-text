We present in this issue a num
ber of interviews, obtained from
several members of the faculty in
terested in student athletics, and
also from students prominent in
athletics and student body affairs,
regarding the proposed training
house for our athletes. This sub
ject is important and merits all the
attention given to it. This year
will probably mark the wiping out
of a debt which has heretofore ham
pered every student body enter
prise and sapped the energy of
every student body financier with
out any apparent good results.
With the departure of this night
mare of our student life, the re
leased resources should go towards
improvements, which we have
wished for so long, yet have dared
not even suggest for fear of becom
ing the laughing stock of our more
staid brethren. The training
house project coming at this time
has met with striking unanimity of
opinion in almost every student,
and the outcome will undoubtedly
be the accomplishment of our de
sires if the affair is not allowed to
drag. The proceedings should be
cool and deliberate, careful and
business-like, not too fast nor too
slow, but once some definite line of
action is settled upon, the project
should be hastened with all possi
ble celerity, in order to complete
the building, if possible, before the
close of this year's training season,
but if not, at least by the beginning
of next year's. In the meantime,
while waiting the action of the com
mittee in charge, the plan should
be widely dis :ussed, and our col
umns are open to any one having
an opinion to promulgate, or any
light to throw on the subject.
