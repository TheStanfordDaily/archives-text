# On Track and Field.
## 
### 
There were about thirty-five men
on the track yesterday going
through the limbering-up process.
The majority of these were new
men, who were taken in charge by
the experienced athletes and put
through the preliminary paces.
Smith led a large squad of dis
tance men, Adams had four walk
ers going the rounds, and Brunton
took care of the sprinting squad,
which shows some very promising
men. Culver was seen working on
the hurdles and jumps with Mor
gan and Boyd. Gil man has gone
at the weights with commendable
energy. He has plenty of strength,
and with a little coaching in form
should earn his sweater this year.
The track is not in the best of
shape for bicycle work, but three
wheels were out for practice, Sayer,
Bradley, and Marvin.
