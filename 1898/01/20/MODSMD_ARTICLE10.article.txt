Thib is the time of the year when
class affairs assume a very certain
degree of importance, and should
attract the attention of the mem
bers of the respective classes. More
especially is this true of the two
upper classes. The Seniors are to
elect officers for their graduating
semester: officers upon whom will
devolve the charge of graduating
class functions and the straighten
ing out of any complex situations
in which the class is involved.
The Junior Class also has inter
ests at stake that demand the at
tention of every member of the
class. The matter of the Annual
has already been too far neglected
by Junior classmen. In fact they

have shown little interest in the
class events of the year. There
should be a representative meeting
of this class tomorrow, as officers
will be elected who will have in
hand the interests of the class for
the semester, which is in many re
spects the most, important of the
whole University course. Matters
of the greatest interest to the class
will l>e brought up at the meet
ings.
