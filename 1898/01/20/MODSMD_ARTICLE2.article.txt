The lecture Tuesday evening on
the Lettre de Cachet. a writ in the
ancient regime of France permitting
the arrest and imprisonment of any
one, was the outcome of Professor
Dudley's recent arrest on the false
charge of counterfeiting. The in
stitution in the United States cor
responding to the old French cus
torn is the John Doe warrant. The
speakers were President Jordan,
Attorney Brun, and Professor Ab
bott.
Dr. Jordan rehearsed the circum
stances of the arrest and the ludi
crous evidence upon which it was
bated. The incident was not much
in itself but it afforded evidence of
the badness of our system of county
government in the United States
and also of the fee system of Cali
fornia. The not iceable point of the
whole affair was that fifty miles
from home a man under no sus
picion, save that he wore roughish
clothes, could be arrested and kept
in custody for two nights and two
days with no channel for publicity
except through the newspapers.
The laws, meant to protect law-abid
ing citizens, did not always protect,
as in this instance.
Attorney Brun pointed out some
of the defects of the act to establish
a uniform system of county govern
ment in California, especially in
those sections regarding the salar
ies of justices of the peace and the
constables and the mileage allowed
the latter.
Professor Abbott explained the
provisions of the vagrant law and
showed the evils of the fee system
iti Santa Clara county and in other
parts of California. He advocated
the repeal of the vagrant law and
the putting of justices of the peace
oil a salary measured by the size of
the township. This would tend to
make them more efficient, to keep
vagrants from contact with crim
als, and to reduce the expense.
