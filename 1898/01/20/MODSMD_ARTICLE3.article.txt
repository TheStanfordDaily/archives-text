# PLANNING THE HOUSE.
## Committee on Training House Met Today and Considered Ways and Means. 
### 
The special committee appointed
by the Executive Committee to
look into the advisability of build
ing a training house, consisting of
the student body treasurer, the
three Varsity managers, and Paul
Adams, '98, met this afternoon in
the Beta house. Mr. Pomeroy, as
chairman, appointed Mr. Keesling
as secretary.
The members of the committee
were agreed as to the need of such
a house and decided to report fa
vorably to the Executive Commit
tee and to recommend that the
matter be brought before the stu
dent body, as it seems to be not
fairly understood bv all at present.
It was the general opinion that
the cost of the house should not ex
ceed $1,500. Architects are to be
asked to submit plans fora house
costing this amount. The house is
to be well built and so arranged
that additions can be made to it,
especially a dining-room and
kitchen, when it shall seem expedi
ent that such be done. The house
is to contain a furnace and drying
room for the football men's clothes
in the cellar. On the first floor is
to be a large assembly hall where
the trainer can meet his teams and
which is to be fitted for the display
of trophies and team pictures. On
this floor also are to be lockers,
baths, and a rubbing-room. On
the second floor are to be store
rooms, the trainer's room, and the
janitor's room.
The site of the house was dis
cussed. It must be in a position
near to all the athletic fields. It
was decided that the best location
is between the tennis courts and
Encina Hall. The highest ground
is there, which is an important con
sideration.
Treasurer Pomeroy said the stu
dent body could go into debt for
part of the amount. Money will
be saved in various ways by the
house. For instance, what at pres
ent amounts to the interest on $300
fora year is consumed on a store
room for football material, and the
room is unventilated. In various
other ways money is paid in rent
which could he just as well paid as
interest. There are various meth
ods for raising money under con
sideration. Among them the Glee
and Mandolin Clubs are to be asked
, to give a benefit concert as soon as
I possible.
