Some trouble has arisen in con
nection with the publication of the
'99 Annual.
At the beginning of the last se
mester an assessment was levied on
the Junior Class for the support of
the book, as has been done in
former years. It seems that the
assessment has not been very gen
erally paid, and, on account of the
attitude of the publishing house in
San Francisco in demanding a de
posited guarantee, the editorial and
business departments of the book
have been em harassed in their
work.
The question that is now agitat

the public is, Will there be an An
nual? Chris M. Bradley, the ed
itor-in-chief of the book, when seen
this afternoon, made the following
statement: "Yes, the situation is
critical, but the obstacles in the
way of the book are not, I think,
insurmountable. Here we have an
editorial board of undoubted ability
fairly straining to begin work; we
have an active business depart
ment ready to do the best that any
man can do; we have the finest ar
tistic ability at our command that
has ever been in the University,
and 1 can not believe that the '99
Class will shirk the first responsi
bility that has been placed upon it,
through indifference or lack of pa
triotism. However, what is done
must he done immediately.
"The situation as it stands is
this: The printers of San Fran
cisco, warned by their experience
with previous Annuals, have taken
justifiable steps for their own se
curity by requiring a deposit of
some $250 and a contract for the
payment of any delicit after issue
within a reasonable time. The con
tract can not be signed until the
money is deposited, and no "copy"
can be handled until the contract
is signed. You see the matter is
entirely in the hands of the class.
The assessment is not larger than
usual, and I do not understand
why the Juniors do not pay it, if
they want us to go ahead with the
book.
"Asitis, we are entirely balked in
both the editorial and business de
partments. If we are to be re
lieved from the situation action
must be quick, as there is a great
deal of work to be done in the next
two months.
"The members of the Annual
staff are willing to give their time
and talent for this work. It lies
with the class to show their appre
ciation of it. An editor and bus
iness manager can not get out a
book alone, and the struggle we are
making for support would be pic
turesquely humorous if it were not
so pathetic. Ido not believe, how
ever, that the class will fall down.
1 anticipate some favorable action
at the class meeting tomorrow. I
do not like to fail where no other
class has failed, and I think that
the class shares my feeling."
