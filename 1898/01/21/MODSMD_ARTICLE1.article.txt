# DEBATES LAST EVENING.
## The 						First Series of Contests in the Intercollegiate Preliminaries Was Held in the Chapel. 
### 
The first of the preliminaries for
the Intercollegiate was held in the
chapel last evening. There were
about two hundred people present.
Mrs. Smith, the chairman, intro
duced the debates with a few rc
murks concerning the history of
the former contests between Berke
ley and Stanford. Each Univer
sity has won two debates since the
beginning of the contests, and this
is the year that decides who shall
possess the handsome cup offered
by the hammer to the University
which shall first win three of
the annual debates. Besides the
cup there is a prize of $200, given
by Senator Perkins to be divided
among the winning team.
The judges for the debates were
Professors Ross, Show, and Lathrop.
Professor Ross has withdrawn from
his place as judge on account of
illness, and Dr. Elliott will serve
for the debates tonight and tomor
row night. The first debate last
night was on the question, "Re
solved, That the United States
should allow the railroads to com
bine in pools." The first speaker
on the affirmative was XV. E. Dick
son. He gave a short review of
early railroad development, show
ing the growth and harm of dis
crimination brought about by over
competition, and held that this
worked an injury as great to the
people as to the roads in the wa} 1
of secret rates and rebates. He
maintained that combinations in
pools would make the rates uni
iorm and calculable by the people,
leading to increased traffic and
lower rates on account of it.
The negative of the question was
very ably supported by Charles
Quayle. He showed that the tend
ency of pools was to minimize com
petition, with the result of monopoly
with all of its powers and evils. He
also brought out very logically the
matter of discrimination between
commercial centers, and claimed
tiiat, notwithstanding the fact that
the rates under a pooling arrange
ment would seem uniform, there
would be secret rebates.
Warren Chase closed the affirma
tive of the question in a very forci
ble and logical speech. He further
emphasized the disasters of dis
crimination, and showed that by
experience, legislation could not
cope with the question. The Inter
state Commerce Commission had
recognized the futility of its anti
pooling law and had asked for its
repeal He showed that in the
pooling era rates went down and
the arrangement was satisfactory
to the people, as evidenced by their
letters. Chase made the most tell
ing speech in this debate.
The second debate was on the
question, "Resolved, That an in
come tax would be a desirable part
of our national system of taxation."
The speakers were Marvin, '01, and
Palstine, '00, for the affirmative,
and Rothrock, '98, for the negative.
Marvin opened the debate. He
contended that the first maxim of
taxation was "Every man accord
ing to his ability." Those who

reaped the greatest benefit should
pay the most, and for an even grad
ing of taxation the income tax was
the most feasible. He showed that
the Government paid out more for
the protection of large properties
than small, and that the large
should pay for such protection in
proportion. He said that the tax
was in vogue in many countries of
Europe, and gave almost universal
satisfaction. As for the inquisitor
ial objection, all taxes were inquisi
torial —for instance, the revenue
taxes.
E. H. Rothrock, the speaker on
the negative, spoke of the question
from a practical standpoint, en
deavoring to tear down the theo
retical conclusions of his adver
saries. He maintained that the
tax would have a demoralizing and
corrupting tendency on the people,
who would try to avoid payment,
and made a vigorous attack on the
inquisitorial feature, lie contended
that a direct tax was odious and
would lead to a most determined
opposition, with disastrous results.
O. P. Palstine closed the discus
sion of the question for the affirma
tive, making one of the strongest
speeches of the evening. He laid
down three features which must
characterize a good tax, and fitted
the income tax to them. They
were flexibility, certainty, and abil
ity to pay. He showed that when
the tax was in vogue in this
country it was cheaper by half to
collect it than to collect the tariff
and internal revenue taxes. He
also excused the inquisitorial fea
ture by reference to other taxes,
and more especially to the internal
revenue tax. He also cited the re
quirements exacted of passengers
on landing at the principal ports of
the country as an example of in
quisition which is allowed.
The concluding debates of the
series take place tomorrow even
ing, and the decision of the judges
will be announced at that time.
John M. Switzer, '98, R. E. Eilcher,
'99, S. G. Bailie, '99, and James
Ferguson, '99, will debate the ques
tion of allowing convict labor in
the United States, and J. E. Cuni
mings, '01, S. W. Charles, '97, and
C. S. Chandler, '99, the question of
the expediency of the Fifteenth
Amendment.
