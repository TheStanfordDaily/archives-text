The '99 class for the third time,
at least, decided today to support
the Annual. The only tiling for
the Juniors to do now, since they
have decided what they are going to
do, is to give the Annual in i nage
ment some of the financial support
promised. If every member of the
class can raise or borrow the money
needed to pay the levied assessment
before a week from Saturday, the
question of whether '99 shall have
an Annual will be a thing of the past.
Today's meeting decided the ques
tion as far as the class is concerned;
the matter now rests with each in
dividual Junior, whether his duty
to the class will be fulfilled.
