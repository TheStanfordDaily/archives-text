cided to try the experiment of al
lowing students to take hooks from

and keep them until Monday morn
ing. Hooks will he given out under
the following conditions: Applica
tions for books must be made of
W. A. Sutherland at the library
desk between 4 and 5 p.m. Sat
days, and the books must be
returned to him between 8:30
and 9:30 the following Monday
morning. On taking out a book
the student will give a receipt,
which will he given back to him
when the book is returned. The
number of books that each student
can take out is limited to two. Stu
dents who have access to the al
coves of the library will be subject
to the same rules as others, and
any infraction of these rules on a
student's part will lead to the can
celing of the offender's permit.
"This new regulation," said Li
brarian Nash, ''is an experiment.
Whether or not it becomes perma
nent rests with the students them
selves. If the rules are observed
generally, students will be allowed
the privilege during the remainder
of the semester, but if, after a fair
trial, it is found that the rules are
being broken or neglected, the ex
periment will be discontinued."
