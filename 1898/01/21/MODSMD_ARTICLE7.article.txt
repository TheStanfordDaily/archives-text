# Ex-Captain Fickert's Views.

### 
Charles M. Fickert, '98, who con
ducts the athletic department of
the Sequoia, has in the current is
sue expressed his views on the
training-house plan. He says:
"There is still some talk of doing
away with Eastern coaches, leav
ing the coaching of the team en
tirely in the hands of graduate stu
dents, and applying the money
spent for coaches in the erection of
a training-house.
"The track management is
ambitious of spending the sur
plus football money in the erec
tion of a training-house for the
track team. The scheme in many
ways is a good one, but the money
on hand is not sufficient to build a
house that would be of much ben
efit, and it would therefore seem
better to put it off until we have
sufficient moiiey to build one that
would do credit to the University.
In the spending of the football
money some should be expended in
providing a turf field for football.
Most of the largegames in the East
are played on such fields, and thus
many accidents that result from
such a field as ours are avoided."
