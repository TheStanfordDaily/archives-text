music by Mrs. E. 1). Starbuck.
Professor Lathrop in announcing
the decision stated that it was
unanimous and that the only re
gret of the judges was that there
were not two Berkeleys on the
Coast. He alsu spoke of the ad
mirable argumentative quality of
the debaters, and touched upon the
defects in voice and gesture, and
the fact that several paid too close
attention to their notes.
James Ferguson, '99, in theopin
ion of every one who attended the
debates, made the most forcible and
most eloquent speech in the prelim
inaries. His arguments were good,
and his gestures very effective He
is a speaker of much experience,
and is perfectly at ease on the plat
form. Mr. Ferguson has tilled the
position of Methodist minister at
May field, temporarily, and has
ethics for his major at the Uni
versity, although he intends to en
ter the profession of law. He is a
member of Euphronia.
S. G. Bailie is also a junior. He

county, also an officer in the Whit
tier State Reform School. In the
University he has taken an inter
est in debating, is a member of Eu
phronia, and was recently elected
on the Intercollegiate Debating
Committee. As a speaker he is
clear and logical, has a clear voice,
and a good stage presence.
Andrew B. Morgan, '98, has a
record that is known to every stu
dent, having been a member of last
year's Carnot team, and the win
ning Intercollegiate teayi. This year
he represents Stanford on the Car
not Debate as well as the Intercol
legiate. He is one of the strongest
debaters at Stanford, having a clear
voice, good control, natural and
easy gestures, with a wide debating
experience which usually gives him
an advantage over his adversary.
He is a member of Philolexia.
S. W. Charles, '98, the alternate,
is a law student, and represented

one of the best speeches of t he even
ing. His arguments were clever,
and he used good judgment in pre
senting them, as well as in rebuttal.
He is forcible and earnest in de
livery. He is a member of Eu
phronia.
Friday evening, L. L. Loof
bourow, '01, and (i. H. Yost, '99,
on the affirmative, and Carl Hay
den, '(JO, on the negative, debated

the question of Hawaiian annexa
tion.
Loofbourow made a very good
speech, showing the advantages of
annexation, the precedents in favor,
the existing commercial union, and
the necessity of annexing the is
lands in order to complete our
national policy. His speech was
earnest and scholarly.
Hayden replied for the negative
that the United States would gain
nothing by annexation; that it
would be good for Hawaii and not
for us; that we already possessed a
commercial monopoly; that we al
ready possess all of the needed mil
itary advantage.-; and that the pre
cedent established would be danger
ous.
Yost, '99, spent the most of his
time in rebuttal, and showed the
close connection between Hawaii
and the United States, and the con
ditions which made annexation
necessary.
The second debate on Friday
evening was a duel between A. 11.
Suzzallo and A. B. Morgan. The
question was the expediency of the
colonial enterprises of France in
Southeastern Asia, under the third
Republic.
Suzzallo*made a very eloquent
and convincing argument to the ef
fect that the colonial policy of
France had been unwise, because
the French are not a colonizing
people, and that the colonial enter
prises brought about immense waste
of productive power and a like loss
of human life and energy, with no
commercial return.
A. B. Morgan, '98, made the win
ning speech of the evening, effec
tually rebutting the arguments of
the affirmative and establishing his
point that the state of European
politics rendered necessary vigorous
action on the part of France, es
pecially in colonial enterprises. He
also showed that the French are
not intrinsically a non-colonizing
people, and that the colonies in
Asia afford room for the overflow of
French population and give France
an opening in Asia and also con
trol of the key to China.
Professor Starbuck presided.
The debates Saturday evening
were unusually interesting and the
chapel was well filled. Professor
Dudley presided. The first debate
was upon the question, "Resolved,
That the inmates of the penal and
reformatory institutions of the
United States should not be al
lowed to engage in productive in
dustry other than that nececessary
for the use of State institutions."
.John M. Switzer, '98, and 11. F.
Filcher, '99, spoke on the affirma
tive, and James Ferguson, '99, and
S. (Â». Bailie, '99, on ihe negative.
John M. Switzer, although suffer
ing from illness, opened the debate,
and it was evident at once that he
was not speaking with the strength
that characterized him in his for
mer efforts, both in the prelimi
naries and in the Intercollegiate
Debate last year. His speech, nev
ertheless, was creditable, although
it lacked the usual force and elo
quence of his speeches. He
He outlined the question and the
New York plan of employing con
victs in producing the necessary

articles for the State institutions.
He pointed out the defects of the
present system of contract labor
as a reformatory for criminals, and
also the saving to the State of the
new system.
S. G. Bailie displayed strong ar
gumentative ability, and delivered
a carefully prepared argument, re
butting and establishing some
strong points of fact. He held that
a system destructive to free labor
should be abolished, and then pro
ceeded to apply the New York sys
tem as advocated by the affirma
tive to California conditions, show
ing that three hundred criminals
could supply the State institutions,
and raisin theg question of what
to do with the remaining two thou
sand. He characterized the plan
of the affirmative as failing to re
form and also failing in giving an
economic gain to society.
11. E. Filcher, '99, in a very able
speech, delivered with force and
earnestness, showed the injustice of
the present system, and the merits
of the one proposed, which would
not throw the products of cheap
labor into the open market to the
injury of the free workman, and
which would also teach the convict
a trade, give him mental and moral
training and also when free a
chance to become an honest man.
James Ferguson made the most
eloquent speech of the series. He
pointed out the inconsistency of
the affirmative in maintaining that
their system would reduce compe
tition and showed that their plan
was not similar to the New York
system. He also raised the trade
unionists' objection that competi
tion was increased by teaching the
convicts trades. The inability to
employ all the criminals would
give rise to idleness, with an im
possibility of reform. The present
system could be changed to include
the advantages advocated by the
affirmative with none of its evils.
In the concluding debate on the
question of the expediency of the
Fifteenth Amendment, J. F. Cum
tilings, '01, on the affirmative, had
a well thought out speech, delivered
very well. C. S. Chandler on the
negative was very concise and con
secutive, and deserves a great deal
of credit for his effort. S. \Y.
Charles, '98, was superior in argu
ment, in that respect having one of
the finest speeches of the evening.
After a series of preliminary de

naries and in the Intercollegiate
Debate last year. His speech, nev
ertheless, was creditable, although
it lacked the usual force and elo
quence of his speeches. He
He outlined the question and the
New York plan of employing con
victs in producing the necessary

articles for the State institutions.
He pointed out the defects of the
present system of contract labor
as a reformatory for criminals, and
also the saving to the State of the
new system.
S. G. Bailie displayed strong ar
gumentative ability, and delivered
a carefully prepared argument, re
butting and establishing some
strong points of fact. He held that
a system destructive to free labor
should be abolished, and then pro
ceeded to apply the New York sys
tem as advocated by the affirma
tive to California conditions, show
ing that three hundred criminals
could supply the State institutions,
and raisin theg question of what
to do with the remaining two thou
sand. He characterized the plan
of the affirmative as failing to re
form and also failing in giving an
economic gain to society.
11. E. Filcher, '99, in a very able
speech, delivered with force and
earnestness, showed the injustice of
the present system, and the merits
of the one proposed, which would
not throw the products of cheap
labor into the open market to the
injury of the free workman, and
which would also teach the convict
a trade, give him mental and moral
training and also when free a
chance to become an honest man.
James Ferguson made the most
eloquent speech of the series. He
pointed out the inconsistency of
the affirmative in maintaining that
their system would reduce compe
tition and showed that their plan
was not similar to the New York
system. He also raised the trade
unionists' objection that competi
tion was increased by teaching the
convicts trades. The inability to
employ all the criminals would
give rise to idleness, with an im
possibility of reform. The present
system could be changed to include
the advantages advocated by the
affirmative with none of its evils.
In the concluding debate on the
question of the expediency of the
Fifteenth Amendment, J. F. Cum
tilings, '01, on the affirmative, had
a well thought out speech, delivered
very well. C. S. Chandler on the
negative was very concise and con
secutive, and deserves a great deal
of credit for his effort. S. \Y.
Charles, '98, was superior in argu
ment, in that respect having one of
the finest speeches of the evening.
After a series of preliminary de
bates, the best that have been held
at Stanford for several years, the
decision of the judges, Professors
Show and Lathrop and Registrar
Elliott, was that the following men
should constitute the Stanford In
tercollegiate Debating Team of 1898:
James Ferguson, '99; S. G. Bailie,
"99; and A. B. Morgan, '98; with
S. \V. Charles, '97, as alternate.
The usual tiresome interim be
tween the close of the debates and
the decision of the judges did not
exist Saturday evening, having
been filled by some delightful
music by Mrs. E. 1). Starbuck.
Professor Lathrop in announcing
the decision stated that it was
unanimous and that the only re
gret of the judges was that there
were not two Berkeleys on the
Coast. He alsu spoke of the ad
mirable argumentative quality of
the debaters, and touched upon the
defects in voice and gesture, and
the fact that several paid too close
attention to their notes.
James Ferguson, '99, in theopin
ion of every one who attended the
debates, made the most forcible and
most eloquent speech in the prelim
inaries. His arguments were good,
and his gestures very effective He
is a speaker of much experience,
and is perfectly at ease on the plat
form. Mr. Ferguson has tilled the
position of Methodist minister at
May field, temporarily, and has
ethics for his major at the Uni
versity, although he intends to en
ter the profession of law. He is a
member of Euphronia.
S. G. Bailie is also a junior. He
is a man with a great deal of ex
perience, having been a teacher in
the public schools of Los Angeles
county, also an officer in the Whit
tier State Reform School. In the
University he has taken an inter
est in debating, is a member of Eu
phronia, and was recently elected
on the Intercollegiate Debating
Committee. As a speaker he is
clear and logical, has a clear voice,
and a good stage presence.
Andrew B. Morgan, '98, has a
record that is known to every stu
dent, having been a member of last
year's Carnot team, and the win
ning Intercollegiate teayi. This year
he represents Stanford on the Car
not Debate as well as the Intercol
legiate. He is one of the strongest
debaters at Stanford, having a clear
voice, good control, natural and
easy gestures, with a wide debating
experience which usually gives him
an advantage over his adversary.
He is a member of Philolexia.
S. W. Charles, '98, the alternate,
is a law student, and represented
Stanford on the Carnot last year.
In the debates aturday he made
one of the best speeches of t he even
ing. His arguments were clever,
and he used good judgment in pre
senting them, as well as in rebuttal.
He is forcible and earnest in de
livery. He is a member of Eu
phronia.
Friday evening, L. L. Loof
bourow, '01, and (i. H. Yost, '99,
on the affirmative, and Carl Hay
den, '(JO, on the negative, debated

the question of Hawaiian annexa
tion.
Loofbourow made a very good
speech, showing the advantages of
annexation, the precedents in favor,
the existing commercial union, and
the necessity of annexing the is
lands in order to complete our
national policy. His speech was
earnest and scholarly.
Hayden replied for the negative
that the United States would gain
nothing by annexation; that it
would be good for Hawaii and not
for us; that we already possessed a
commercial monopoly; that we al
ready possess all of the needed mil
itary advantage.-; and that the pre
cedent established would be danger
ous.
Yost, '99, spent the most of his
time in rebuttal, and showed the
close connection between Hawaii
and the United States, and the con
ditions which made annexation
necessary.
The second debate on Friday
evening was a duel between A. 11.
Suzzallo and A. B. Morgan. The
question was the expediency of the
colonial enterprises of France in
Southeastern Asia, under the third
Republic.
Suzzallo*made a very eloquent
and convincing argument to the ef
fect that the colonial policy of
France had been unwise, because
the French are not a colonizing
people, and that the colonial enter
prises brought about immense waste
of productive power and a like loss
of human life and energy, with no
commercial return.
A. B. Morgan, '98, made the win
ning speech of the evening, effec
tually rebutting the arguments of
the affirmative and establishing his
point that the state of European
politics rendered necessary vigorous
action on the part of France, es
pecially in colonial enterprises. He
also showed that the French are
not intrinsically a non-colonizing
people, and that the colonies in
Asia afford room for the overflow of
French population and give France
an opening in Asia and also con
trol of the key to China.
Professor Starbuck presided.
The debates Saturday evening
were unusually interesting and the
chapel was well filled. Professor
Dudley presided. The first debate
was upon the question, "Resolved,
That the inmates of the penal and
reformatory institutions of the
United States should not be al
lowed to engage in productive in
dustry other than that nececessary
for the use of State institutions."
.John M. Switzer, '98, and 11. F.
Filcher, '99, spoke on the affirma
tive, and James Ferguson, '99, and
S. (Â». Bailie, '99, on ihe negative.
John M. Switzer, although suffer
ing from illness, opened the debate,
and it was evident at once that he
was not speaking with the strength
that characterized him in his for
mer efforts, both in the prelimi
naries and in the Intercollegiate
Debate last year. His speech, nev
ertheless, was creditable, although
it lacked the usual force and elo
quence of his speeches. He
