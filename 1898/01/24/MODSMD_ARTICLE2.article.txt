# "Paganism of Our Day."
## 
### 
It was announced before the ser
mon yesterday that next Thursday
evening the day of prayer for col
leges will be observed in the Chapel
at 7:30 pin. Following are ex
tracts from Rabbi Voorsanger's ser
mon on ''Paganism of Modern So
ciety":
Isaiah was a prophet or orator
who lived between 700 and 700
B. C. He tells his own experiences
in his book, lie faced an issue
which few appreciate.
You have no idea what a "super
natural revelation" means. There
is the old story of how a crowd of
people were gathered at the foot of
a mountain; there was thunder and
lightning, and suddenly a voice out
of the heavens said, ''Thou shalt
not." This is all very well as a
poetical symbolism, but it will

not do for thinking people who
must see God in the natural world.
There is no truth in the world
that must not at different times be
taught by different methods. So I
read the Bible today in the light
of the knowledge of the nineteenth
century and L find wonderful
things. I find the evolution of re
ligion. The gradual evolution of
the idea of one God is truly a di
vine revelation.
As far ;is poetry goes, paganism
gives us the most beautiful in the
world. Many of its noble ideas
have been transplanted into mod
ern monotheism. The deification
of nature is beautiful. But pagan
ism was not only a poetical re
ligion; it was a civilization. It
possessed a beautiful exterior, but
its heart was rotten and it doomed
the world to downfall.
Assyria was strongly connected
to Judea by commerce, language,
and royal intermarriages. Its civ
ilization was corrupt at the heart,
and began to eat away the life of
Israel. Now, Isaiah stood up and
called a halt. He set up a new
theory and matched it against
paganism. It was the idea of God,
the ime God of the heaven and
later of the universe, above low
human passions, pure, not ma
terial, altogether spiritual. Hence
the Jewish code which laid the
foundation of a new society. The
feeling of moral responsibility to
God, an inevitable and dis
tinguished characteristic of mono
theism, is the great idea of all mod
ern civilization and the life of
Christianity.
The light against Paganism has
continued through the ages until
now. Is it a success? It is a fail
ure. We are not pagans, but we
do many things that are pagan.
Isaiah gives a catalogue of condi
tions which are distinctly pagan
Is there any difference, except in
point of time, between any of the
means and modes of corruption as
Isaiah describes them and their
counterparts in our day? The na
ture of the ancient Jew is in us.
There is an awful contrast between
Christianity as it is taught and the
civilization of modern times. The
real inonotheist is he who has been
able to balance his material and
spiritual natures, to make mind
superior over body, who feels his
responsibility to God. It is your
duty to assist in the progress of the
world, to help in this fight.
