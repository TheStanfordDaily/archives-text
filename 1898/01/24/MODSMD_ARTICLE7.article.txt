This intercollegiate debaters ha ve
been chosen, and the congratula
tions which the successful debaters
are receiving are their just reward
for the days of ciireful preparation
which won them the honor as well
as the responsibility of representing
the student body of Stanford in
the critical contest this year, which
determines the possession of the
handsome cup which the San Fran
cisco Eoraviine? offered m 18i)4 to
the college first winning three de
hates. Since 1894 each college has
won two, although since the insti
tution of intercollegiate debates
Stanford has won three. Last
year's team won a victory when it
was necessary to establish Stan
ford's reputation in debating. This
year's team has that also to sustain
and the additional task of winning
a debating trophy. In their efforts
to bring home victory, they will
have the support of the entire stu
dent body, which has confidence in
them as a representative team.
The general excellence of the de
bates this year and the smoothness
with which the preliminaries were
conducted is proof that our present
system, although not yet perfect,
works well. The wisdom of having
courses in the University, such as
the one in Oral Discussion, is also
apparent. The debates last week
also showed the strength of Stan
ford's reserve debaters, among whom
are several of unusual promise.
There were a number of contestants
of almost equal ability, so that the
decision of the judges must have
been difficult, requiring very care
ful discrimination. The choice as
made should receive the support of
all.
