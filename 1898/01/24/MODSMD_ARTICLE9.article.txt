—Fall rowing has ended at Har
vard. Coach Lehman sailed for
England on January 1.
—At the '98 class election at
Harvard on December 15, the Aus
tralian ballot system was used in
order to poll a larger and more
representative vote. Polls were
open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
—Four performances of Racine's
tragedy "Athalie" were given at
Harvard during December under
the auspices of the French depart
ment. The play had been staged
at great expense and the costumes
and scenery were very rich. Mem
bers of the French department and
Harvard and Radcliffe students
took part in the play, which was
received with much favor.
— Mr. Frank Thomson of Phila
delphia has presented a new launch
to the Harvard crew. It is being
built by the Cramp Co., and will
have a possible speed of fifteen
knots an hour, a much greater speed
than that of the "John Harvard,"
the crew's present launch. It will
also draw a foot less water than
the''John Harvard," and is being
built very low with an especial
view to navigating the Charles
River.
--Randolph Hall, Harvard's new
dormitory, will be one oi the linest
and best equipped at Harvard.
Work was begun on it about the
lirst of last July, and it will be
completed probably by the middle
of next June. The building alone
cost $160,000, and is planned with
all possible conveniences. There
are fifty suites ranging in price
from single rooms at $200 to d< nble
rooms at $700. In each room there
will be telephones connecting with
the janitor's room, and beside the
exercise- and reading-rooms on the
ground floor there is to be a break
fast-room open only to those room
ing in the building. The agent has
already received applications for
nearly every room in the building.
