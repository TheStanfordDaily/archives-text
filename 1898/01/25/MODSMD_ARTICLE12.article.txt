The announcement of the fact j
that, the discontinuance of the Uiii-|
versitv summer school is being j
taken into consideration by tlit*j
University authorities is some-j
thing of a surprise, when the sue,-j
cess of the school in past years is j
considered. Such a school affords!
many opportunities for outside
people to come within the influence
of the University, and the number
of friends thus made for this insti
tution can not be calculated. If for
financial reasons the school must
be discontinued, it is to be hoped
that it will be only for the present,
and that before long this useful
part of our University system will
be again in active operation.
