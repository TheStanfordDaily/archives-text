college dailies in the United States
is increased to eleven.
—The University of Chicago has
posted a bulletin which notifies
students that it is in bad taste to
smoke near the entrance to build
ings visited by women, adding that
there is no rule beyond that of

— After conference between Cap

whether the race will l»e between
Harvard and Yale, or a three-cor
nered race with Cornell.

held recently. It was decided to
train two different crews next

another to enter the Harlem re

—The following clipping, taken
from the New York World, shows
that the fatalities in football are in
small proportion compared with
other sports. "Fatal accidents in
different branches of sport since
1894: Swimming, 1 350: boating,
986; hunting, 654; bicycling, 264;
horseback riding, 333; ice boating,
22; baseball, 6; tennis, 4; golf, 2;
football, 11."
—At Cornell this year for the
tirst time all the work for the
bachelor's degree is elective. The
choice of studies has developed sev
eral unexpected results. Latin and
Greek have not suffered under the
elective system; mathematics has
gained, instead of losing as was ex
pected; and the scientific courses,
which it was anticipated would be
benefited, have lost considerably.
