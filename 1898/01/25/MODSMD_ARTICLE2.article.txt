# The First Practice.
## 
### 
Thirty men were out for the first
practice on the diamond yesterday
afternoon. Three batteries were at
work near the backstop, while both
the outfield and in field were kept
busy with batted balls. Young,
'98, was at first, his old position,
with Edwards, '01, and Murphy,
'00, on the other bags. But two of
the old Varsity men were out, the
remainder being principally new
men.
llill, '98, Lawrence, '01, and
Wrigley, '01, the ambidextrous
twirler, were limbering up their
arms, and present appearances in
dicate that Beckett will have to
work very hard if he expects to
hold his position down this semes
ter.
Behind the hat Swindells bids
fair to make a strong second to
Captain .Jeffs, who will not be able
to get out for two or three weeks at
least. There is an abundance of
good materia], and this year's team
will be a strong one.
