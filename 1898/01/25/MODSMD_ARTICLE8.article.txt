# WHITNEY ON ATHLETICS.
## Criticism of the Tendencies of Intercollegiate Sport in California. 
### 
Casper Whitney, who conducts
the athletic department of Harper's
Weekly, while on his way to Siam
on a hunting expedition visited
San Francisco, and the results of
his investigations are set forth in
the current issue of the weekly.
His article is accompanied by cuts
of the athletic grounds of Stanford
and the University of California.
From the advance sheets of the
weekly we clip the following
referring to the athletics of Stan
ford and Berkeley:
'•The only sport with pretensions
to university distinction is fur
nished by the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley, near Oakland,
which is across the bay from San
Francisco, and by Leland Stanford
.Jr. University at Palo Alto, about
an hour's ride by rail from San
Francisco. 1 particularize loca
tions merely to show how near they
are to one another and to I he cen
ter of all California life —San Fran
cisco. At both of these institu
tions there has been within three
years a very material progression in
the science of athletics and the per
manent establishment of a proper
ethical standard. Truth to tell,
however —although the develop
ment of playing skill has resulted
from undergraduate enthusiasm
and diligent practice —the cleanli
ness of the sport is in a very large
measure due to the unrelaxing vig
ilance and unremitting exhorta
tion of the faculty athletic commit
tees — or, to be literally correct, to
one or two sportsmanly members of
those committees. It is quite true
that there still lurks among the
undergraduates a sentiment bent
on winning by fair means or foul,
which on occasion finds expression
through baseball and football man
agers, in the playing of some man
who in the spirit of the amateur
law is ineligible.
"The letter of the law is seldom
broken nowadays, but every once
in a while the faculty committee is
hoodwinked by a manager more
artful than sportsmanly, and men
are found at Berkeley or at Stan
ford for athletic purposes only.
Such a case, for instance, was that
of Searight at Stanford last foot
ball season, and another such seems
to be Sheehy at Berkeley this sea
son.
"These deflections from vvhole
someness would occur less fre
quently if an interest less passive
in the effort making for healthful
sport was evinced by the faculties
generally at Berkeley and Stanford,
and even especially by all the mem
bers of the faculty athletic com
mittees. It is the rule the world
over that the real work of any
movement, particularly if it be a
new one, comes from a, very few of
its many sponsors. And the ath
letic reform movement at these two
universities of California reveals 110
exception. A very few men at
these institutions are responsible
for the splendid results, and of
these few the names most closely
identified with the missionary work
are those of Professors Frank An
gell, E. B. Clapp, and Bacon. The
combined efforts of these gentlemen,

subscribed to by their respective
faculties, have been the means of
raising a very satisfactory ethical
standing, and of making some
praiseworthy rules to assure its
maintenance. Of these none is so
satisfying as that requiring a cer
tain class-room excellence of all
candidates for any of the teams. I
find, too, that this is enforced more
strictly at Stanford than at Berke
ley, by which I judge the various
professors at Berkeley are not so
heartily in sympathy with health
ful athletics as their confreres at
Palo Alto. A less healthful stu
dent spirit at Berkeley as a natural
result of this faculty indifference
should not be surprising.
"The undergraduate sentiment
of sport for sport's sake is not very
much in evidence at either of the
universities, but it is hardly recog
nizable at Berkeley. Still, there is
obviously more of it than when I
visited here two years ago. It is
growing slowly, and the more prac
tical encouragement it receives from
the faculty, the sooner will that
body be able to solve some of the
perplexing questions with which it
is now confronted. By their deeds
shall ye know them, rather than
bv their protestations."
Whitney advocates a separate
athletic organization for Coast ath
letes.
