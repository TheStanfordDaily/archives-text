# BASEBALL PRACTICE.
## Very Encouraging Showing Made on the Diamond Yesterday. 
### 
The baseball practice last night
was very promising. More of the
old men were in suits, and the field
presented a lively appearance.
Among the old players who were
out for the lirst time this year were
Lougheed, Klauber, and Beckett.
Captain .left's gave the men prac
tice in batting and fielding. The
new men showed up well, Swindells
and Diviny doing especially good
work. Lanagan, Beckett, and Mill,
wht) are candidates for the position
of pitcher, took turns in throwing
to the batters. Many of the new
men showed themselves heavy hit
ters, and it is possible that the
Varsity this year will l>e one of
the best batting teams that we
have ever had.
Of the many pitchers llill, Lan
agan, and Beckett are in the best
form. Hill has good control and
speed, and his curve- are effective.
Lanagan and Beckett still lack good
control. Fred Kay, '01, is another
candidate for pitcher's position.
This makes the race for that posi
tion a harder one than ever, as Ray
has had considerable experience.
He is from Santa Barbara.
There will be many candidates
for every position on the team this
vear, and none of the old men can
consider their places cinched or
can afford to fail to play to the
very best of their ability. There
is very good material in the fresh
man class.
Captain Jeffs, although not play
ing, made his presence felt, and ex
pressed himself as highly pleased
at the enthusiasm shown.
