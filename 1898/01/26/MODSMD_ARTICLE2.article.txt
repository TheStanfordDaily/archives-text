Last month in selecting his All-
American team for the Illustrated
American Charles E. Patterson, a
prominent writer on athletics, recog
nized the fact that there are foot
ball players outside of the Eastern
colleges, and that some of the best
players are in athletic clubs. In
the opinion of Mr. Patterson, no
All-American eleven could be com
plete without giving a place to Phil
Draper, the old Williams half
back, now playing with the Chi
cago Athletic Club. He continued:
"Then, again, such men as Hersch
berger, Cochems, Hazzard, for
merly of Stanford and now of \\ is
consin, Fickert and Murphy of
Stanford, and Hall of the University
of California would have to be con
sidered in making up an All
- team; and, moreover, we
could not ignore West Point, An
napolis, nor the Carlisle Indians."
Hazzard, '95, center at Stanford
on the team of 1894, played his old
position at Wisconsin last season
and was regarded as a wonder.
Patterson placed him on the All-
Western eleven as center, over all
the centers of the Middle West.
Mr. Patterson gave the Thanks
giving game a very neat write-up
and humorously alluded to the
guards-back play in the following
manner:
"The University of California
had a five-course Thanksgiving
dinner served up by Stanford on
November 25, but unfortunately
there was no particular variety in

the courses. The meal commences
with touch-down soup a la guard a
back, and although there were
number of roasts all served up by
Chef Brooke in interesting style,
they were of the same general ma
terial: namely, guards-back.
"The dinner did not set well upon
the composite Berkeley stomach
and the dessert course was consid
erately omitted, thanks to the roof
of the grandstand, which must
have been a Berkeley sympathizer,
inasmuch as part of it caved in
from general depression, with sev
eral minutes left to play. The fi
nal result was 28-0.
"Doubtless California will apply
for membership in the "Association
for the Suppression of Guards-
Back." This association in a flour
ishing body and there is a large
and constantly growing waiting
list of applicants for admission.
The fate of Berkeley's linemen
was similar to that of Harvard, La
fayette, the Indians, and indeed of
almost every team which has en
countered Mr Woodruff's formid
able play."
Murphy, Cotton, Fickert, and
Carle received praise for their work
