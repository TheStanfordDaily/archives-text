# Everett Brown on Eastern Athletics.

Football Manager Everett Brown
of Berkeley on his return from his
Eastern trip is represented as being
very much disgusted with Eastern
college athletics. The Examiner
quotes him as follows:
''In purity of athletics California
and Stanford offer a most gratify
ing contrast to the great univer
sities of the Eastern States. An
introduction of their methods would
be ruinous to amateur sports.
Again and again the Eastern uni
versities have been held up to us as
models of how athletics should be
conducted. The standard we have
set for ourselves is higher than
theirs. They do know how to play
football better, but Garrett Cochran
is coming now to teach us that.
Harvard, Princeton, Yale, and
Pennsylvania run their athletic af
fairs entirely independent of the
amateur athletic organ'zations.
The leaders of amateur athletics are
afraid to oppose them in anything,
for they refuse to pay any attention
to them. Professionalism is not
counted against a man. Every
college athlete is called an amateur
even if he were a professional prize -
fighter for years before he entered
college Harvard is the only one
of the four great universities of the
East which conducts its athletics
along the lines of reputable ama

teurism, and that is why Harvard
is always beaten.
"Yale, Princeton, and Pennsyl
vania are continually on the watch
all over the East for good athletes
whom they can induce to enter
college by offering to provide their
college expenses. Pennsylvania,
which has been praised to us as a
shining example, recruited its foot
ball team last season all the way
from the country blacksmith shops
to the.New York police force. Men
inter the Eastern universities for
the sole purpose of playing football.
The faculty is well aware of it.
They never attend a recitation, but
they are allowed to stay in college
merely because they help to win
games."
