# THE 						FINAL EFFORT.
## Last Attempt to Raise Funds for the '99 Annual will be Made Tomorrow. 
### 
There has been no change in the
way the *99 Annual matter stands
since yesterday. The enthusiasm
generated at the class meeting last
Friday seems to be gradually dying
out, as indicated by the slowness
of the Junior classmen in paying
their assessments.
Of the $250 required to be de
posited this week the class treas
urer reports a good deal less than
one-half of the amount, something
like $120. It looks much as if the
Annual could not be issued if the
class is depended upon to start it.
A proposition has been made that
ten or more of the Juniors add
from $10 to $20 apiece to the
amount on hand, so as to get the
book in the hands of the printer.
In so doing it is understood that
these men, who advance the money,
are to be reimbursed from the first
monies that come to the Annual.
As the management has in view
lectures by Lieutenant Peary and
F. Marion Crawford, from which
the Annual will realize something,
it is doubtless a safe proposition for
those who back the book in its
present embarrassment. It should
be possible also to collect some
more assessments if time is given,
and it is understood that the first
of these will go to the Annual's
creditors. All Juniors who are
willing to give from $5 to $20 un
der these conditions are requested
to meet Editor Bradley at the office
of the Daily Palo Alto, in the
University power-house, at 1:30
p.m. tomorrow.
