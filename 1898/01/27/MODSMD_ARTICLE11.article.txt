A last effort in being made by
the Junior Annual board to make
it possible lo put the book in the
printer's hands, as is announced in
another column. The proposition
is a loan to the class by some of its
members with a prospect of the re
turn of the whole or a part of the
loan in a short time. Several men
have already signified their willing
ness to make the required advance
under the conditions, and there is
yet a chance for the book if several
more will meet the editor at this
office tomorrow to discuss the mat
ter. There is no reason why the
friends of the Annual should not re
spond to this call and make it pos
sible to issue the book. Those who
are delinquent in assessments are
also requested to come to this meet
ing and lend a h:tnd with $2.50 in
it.
