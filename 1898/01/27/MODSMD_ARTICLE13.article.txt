The Carnot Debate takes place a
week from tomorrow night in Stiles
Hall on the Berkeley campus. It
is time we awoke to a realization of
this fact and prepared to send a

suitable delegation to back our
team and give them the moral sup
port of our presence in this contest.
The president of the Inter-Society
Debating League will probably be
successful in his efforts to secure
special rates from the railroad com
pany. Last year after the debate
the Occident commenting editorially
on the hospitality shown by us to
them when they visited us, hoped
that this year they should be able
to return the compliment. Let us
do our part, if Berkeley will play
host, let us furnish the guests. A
good many of us must go to do as
well as U. C. did last year. Vt
least one hundred and fifty should
be there waiting to cheer the mem
bers of the Stanford team as they
speak on the Berkeley rostrum.
