—The glee, banjo, and mandolin
clubs of Princeton on their Christ
mas trip visited the following
cities: Wilmington, Baltimore,
Washington, Pittsburg, Cleveland,
Indianapolis, Cincinnatti, and Co
lumbus. The total mileage of the
trip was 1765 miles. A joint con
cert was given at Pittsburg by the
Yale and Princeton clubs.
—The Princeton Gun Club by
defeating Yale in the intercollegi
ate shoot of December by a score
of 214 to 197 gave Princeton the
permanent possession of the hand
some silver loving cup offered by
Shooting and Fishing to the college
firfct winning the intercollegiate
shoot three times. Previously the
shoot had been won once by
Harvard and twice each by Yale
and Princeton.
—it is the custom nt Princeton for
each class upon graduation to pre
sent some memorial to the univer
sity. either a collection of books to
the university library or some work
of art to beautify the campus. The
class of '83 founded a prize in po
litical science and as a decennial gift
a library of political science and
jurisprudence, containing about
one thousand volumes, with a sub
stantial endowment for the increase
of the collection. Since '94 was
graduated it has been the custom
for classes to found a memorial
fund and to present a gift at a
later time. Several of the classes
have already collected a large
amount.
