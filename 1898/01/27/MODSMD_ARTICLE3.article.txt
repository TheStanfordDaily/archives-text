# Brown Re-elected.

### 
Everett J. Brown, Berkeley's
present track captain, also man
ager of the football team last year,
has been re-elected to the latter
position for the season of 185)8.
Brown had no opposing candi
date in the race, and his re-election
to this important position in college
affairs shows Berkeley's eminent
satisfaction in Brown's policy last
season. A feature of the meeting
at U. C. yesterday, at which Brown
was re-elected, was an address de
livered by him concerning athletics
in general, and California's athlet
ics in particular, when he took oc
casion to criticize severely the atti
tude of Caspar Whitney on Coast
athletics ns was set forth in an ar
ticle in Harper's Weekly, selections
from which appeared in a recent
number of the Daily Palo Alto.

Brown said that a far higher tone
in athletic pursuits was prevalent
in California's two universities than
in any of the Eastern colleges. He
further took occasion to score the
faculty athletic committee of IJ. C.
on its attitude toward col lege sports,
claiming that the statement made
by that committee that California's
athletics are tainted with profes
sionalism was an outrageous false
hood, wholly without foundation.
