An attempt will be made tonight
to gather together some of the mus
ical talent of the University, in or
der to form a Symphony Club. It
will be the purpose of the club to
perfect itself as far as may lie in
the playing of higher class music,
and possibly concerts may be given
in the future by the club assisted
by other musical talent in the Uni

the instrumental musicians among
the faculty and students have sig

the work, and it is hoped that the
club may he successful in its at
tempts to raise the musical stan
dard of the University community.
