# THE
						THIRD PRACTICE.
## Players, both New and Old, were Out in Force on the Diamond Yesterday. 
### 
The usual large number of can
didates turned out for last night's
baseball practice. Two nines were
made up and regular practice was
begun. Beckett, Hill, \V r rigley, and
Lanagan took turns in the box.
Swindells and Smith were behind
the bat.
Of the pitchers, Lanagan and
Hill are showing up best. The
former had good control in the one
inning he played last night, and
succeeded in striking out three of
the four men who came up before
him. Hill pitched in his usual
form, and shows signs of develop
ing into a very reliable man.
Beckett was wild. If things do
not radically change, he will be
supplanted by one of the other as
pirants. Of the new men, Swin
dells, Edwards, Roberts, and Dud
ley put up good ball. The latter
two are old Belmont players.
Young, Wight, Klauber, and Mur
phy were also out in suits. Strohn
and Harris have not yet appeared.
Captain Jeffs will probably be
well enough in a couple of weeks
to take his old place behind the
bat. This is extremely good news,
for had his knee not improved
Stanford would have been robbed
of an efficient captain and an old
and experienced player.
Great stress is being laid on the
batting even at this early time in
the season. Captain Jeffs is deter
mined to have a team of hitters.
Should any of the new men show
sufficient strength in this direction,
a place will be made for them on
the team.
