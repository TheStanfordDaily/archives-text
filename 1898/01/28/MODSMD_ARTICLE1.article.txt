# CARNOT POSTPONED.
## News to That Effect Received from Berkeley Last Evening by Dr. Ross. 
### 
The Cam >t Debate has been
postponed until February 11. A
telegram was received lant evening
by Professor Ross from Professor
Bacon that it had been announced
for February 11.
The date for the debate had been
set for February 4, one week from
today, by the two faculty commit
tees from the two universities, and
announcement had gone forth to
that effect. Today, according to
the original announcement, the
question fur debate was to have
been made public. In response to
a letter from Dr. Ross, Professor
Bacon responded by telegram that
the debate had been announced at
the University of California as
taking place Friday, February 11.
The postponement of the debate
by this inadvertence was some
thing of a surprise to the Stanford
team, A. B. Morgan, '98, A. H.
Suzzallo, '00, and Miss Anna
Strunsky, '00, as they were anx
iously awaiting the announces ent
of the question. The time will,
however, be valuable for prepara
tion, and it gives the Stanford peo
ple time to organize and make a
respectable showing when they in
vade the Berkeley territory two
weeks from today.
The following is the agreement
governing the Carnot Debate as
adopted by Professor E. A. Ross of
Stanford and Professor Thomas R.
Bacon of the University of Califor
nia, revised as to the date of hold
ing the debate:
"The fourth annual debate for the
Carnot medal will be held at the
University of California on Friday
evening, Feb. 11, 1898. The sub
ject for preparation is, "The colon
ial policy of the Third Republic."
The question for debate will be an
nounced one week before the con
test. The side of the question
which each speaker shall take will
be determined by lot on the day
preceding the contest.
"Each competitor may speak
twice if he wishes, but shall not
speak longer than fifteeen minutes
altogether.
"Spontaneity, excellence of reason
ing, scholarship, style, and delivery
will be considered in determining
the award as well as acquaintance
with French politics."
