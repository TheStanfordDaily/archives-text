The faint praise which Mr. Cas
par Whitney of Harper's Weekly,
in an article from which we have
quoted, gave to intercollegiate ath
letics in California, and the severe
criticism which he has made of
California athletics in general, have
attracted considerable attention in
San Francisco chiefly through the
attitude of Football Manager Ever
ett Brown of the University of
California in the matter. Some of
Mr. Brown's statements in the
newspapers, and he is probably
quoted correctly, are a revelation
as to the way the athletics of some
of the Eastern universities are con
ducted; providing, of course, Mr.
Brown is unbiased in his judgment.
However bad Eastern athletics may
be. is no excuse or justification for
like methods in California. Ath
letics at Stanford have always been
pure and we can deny, with all due
respect to Mr. Whitney, that our
managers have been lead by an ex
cess of zeal to violate the laws of
amateur sport. The spirit of sport
for sport's sake, coupled with the
desire to carry the cardinal on to
victory, is the spirit which actuates
every Stanford athlete â€”not the
spirit of winning by fair means or
foul, which Mr. Whitney asserts is
the dominant principle of inter
collegiate athletics. Mr. Whitney
visited Stanford two years ago, and
during that time seems to have
formed a true estimate of Professor
Frank Angell, although his short
stay here was evidently not sufli
cient for him to discover the true
spirit of the Stanford student body.
We do not impugn his motives,
but we wish him better luck next
time.
