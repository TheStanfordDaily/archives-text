It is pleasant to note the pro
gress in the art work of the Uni
versity and it is hoped that it will

that the department has always
had a hard struggle with in
adequate means and cramped quar
ters, and, it must he admitted, with

a certain amount of general Uni
versity indifference to contend
against. The progress it makes is
all the more creditable on this ac
count. It seems that an annual
exhibition of the best work in all
the classes and perhaps a competi
tion might be arranged for. This
would give a more definite end
toward which the student might
work, and would serve also to call
attention to the art work being
done at Stanford.
