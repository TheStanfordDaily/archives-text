# Berkeley Notes.
## 
### 
—J. W. Leggett was recently
elected president of the senior class
at Berkeley, and Percy Hall of the
junior.
— Eighty men have signed train
ing rules on Berkeley's track team.
A field-day will be held between
the sophomores and freshmen.
—A schedule of inter-class base
ball games has been arranged at
Berkeley. The dental college team
will play the winner of the series.
—Manager Mottof the "Blue and
Gold" of the University of California
has presented a report of the fi
nances of the book. The total in
come of the book was $2,213, of
which $1,989 has already been col
lected and paid. The expenses of
printing, etc., were $'2,113, leaving
a balance after paying all bills of
$100 for the class.
—In baseball this year the Uni
versity of California lost the follow
ing men: Wheeler, catcher; Hennes
sey, first-baseman; Elston, second;
Krug, third; and probably Kuster,
shortstop. These men were all
heavy batters and practically won
the championship for Berkeley.
The Occident says: "Supposing no
change in pitchers at either col
lege, our outlook, with an infield to
develop, is not at all rosy; with im
provement in the Stanford box, it
becomes decidedly gloomy."
