# Revival in Art Interest.
## 
### 
With this year there came a de
cided revival in interest in the work
of the Art department of Stanford,
the work done now being fully up
to the high standard set by the
classes of four years ago. Much
of this renewal of action and en
deavor came ahout with the advent
of Miss Zoe M. Fiske as head of
the life class, that class in particu
lar being more earnest and am
bitious than in former years. Miss
Fiske has wondered at and de
plored the lack of high ideals of
art among students generally dis
played here, where everything
should naturally tend toward cul
tivating a love for the beautiful.
The fact that her presence has done
much to offset the existing apathy

is freely attested by the good work
the students are doing.
In the other branches of the de
partment, under Professor Clark,
the work is marked by earnest ef
fort, and it is noted, as an indication
that the students intend to keep on
in art work, that many are taking
the harder basic courses, such as
"Scientific perspective."
Professor Brown, the head of the
department, is now studying in
Paris, on leave of absence after a
winter of study in New York. His
present work will be of great ad
vantage to the department, as he
is doing the practical part, and will
come back with the latest ideas
and methods of the art circles of
America and Europe.
