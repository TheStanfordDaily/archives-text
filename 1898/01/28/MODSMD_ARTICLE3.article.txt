# Day of Prayer Observed.

### 
The University Prayer Meeting
last night was fairly well attended.
Dr. Jordan and Professor Miller
laid special stress on the non-sec
tarian basis for University religious
spirit, emphasizing the fact that
religion comes out of a man and
can not be put into him. "The re
ligion worth having," said Dr. Jor
dan, "is the one which is gained
through much seeking, and not the
one that is thrust upon the be
liever." Further he stated, "This
is my message to you tonight, that
a university that does not receive
its ideas, forms, or ceremonies from
any one denomination ought to
and can be dominated by the re
ligious spirit which will be all the
stronger because the atmosphere is
free."
Others whp addressed the meet
ing were liev. Burwell and Rev.
J. W. Gray bill of Palo Alto, Pro
fessor Johnston, Dr. Wood, and
Miss Macgilli vray.
