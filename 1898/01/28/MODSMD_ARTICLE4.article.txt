# More Men Out.

Last night's baseball practice
brought out two of the old reliables
who had not before appeared on
the diamond this season. Lough
eed stepped into his old place at
short, and Harris, who played sec
ond base on the '96 Varsity, took a
turn at his oid position.
With the material on hand, there
is little danger of the infield not
being well taken care of. The
ground should be properly covered
and the play quick and regular.
In Captain Jeffs, Stanford has a
catcher possessing the physical
requisites â€”weight, strength, and
quickness. He is sure and can be
depended on to get the ball off to
second without a fatal delay. This
year's fielding can be developed
into sharp and finished work. It
is to pitcher that the college turns
with great concern. A man who,
besides having curves, control, and
speed, has head enough to know
his batters, watch his bases,and re
main unrattled, is requisite. Of
course it is yet too early to know
how well the candidates for the
place will fulfill the conditions.
As the season goes on, a better idea
of their work can be had. It is
not expected that Billy McLaine's
work will be approached. He was
an exceptional man and had large
experience. A pitcher, however,
having some of the qualities which
made him so valuable, ought to be
found in a university as large as
Stanford.
