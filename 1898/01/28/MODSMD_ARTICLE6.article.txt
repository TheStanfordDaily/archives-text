# Temporary Relief.
## 
### 
The Class of '99 has succeeded
in putting enough money in the
Annual manager's hands to insure
the publication of the book, but by
doing so has incurred a debt of
about $100.
This morning a very awkward
situation confronted the Juniors.
There was a class anxious to issue
an Annual, but unable to make the
necessary deposit with the printer
to go ahead with the work. It had
been deemed advisable under the
conditions to borrow the money
from members of the class, as it
was necessary to raise it today. A
large number of assessments re
main unpaid, but, in the opinion of
the Annual authorities, the mem
bers of the class will pay their
dues from the first of the month
remittances to satisfy the obliga
tions which stand against it.
The members of the class have
only given the money in trust to
meet the emergency and make it
easier for those who have not paid
to do so. The collectors will con
tinue their office, as the same situ
ation confronts the class as before.
