# JEFFS' RESIGNATION.
## Stanford's Baseball Captain Obliged to Withdraw from the Team. 
### 
The greatest possible calamity
that could have happened to the
Stanford baseball nine occured to
day, when Captain Jeffs announced
his resignation.
Jeffs has been handicapped by
injuries lo his knee received dur
the football season, which rendered
an operation necessary. Since
that time Jeffs has been improv
ing, but through over-exertion
last week while coaching the base
ball men the water returned on his

knee. Dr. Wood last evening told
Jeffs that it would be impossible
for him to play during this season.
Consequently he was forced to re
sign.
Captain Jeffs' resignation is as
follows: "Owing to an injured knee,
1 am forced to resign my position
as captain of the baseball team.
Until my suceeessor is elected Bert
Lougheed will act as captain.
"A. S. Jeffs."
