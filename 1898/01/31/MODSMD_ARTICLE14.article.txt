The announcement of the resigna
tion of Captain Jeffs will, no doubt,
be a surprise to many. No abler
captain or more serious and de
termined athlete than Jeffs ever
led a Stanford team. The regret
of the baseball men at his retire
ment will be felt by the whole Uni
versity. Jeffs' steady devotion to
athletic interests and his manner
in contests have made him an en
viable name in our athletic history.
The injury which has forced him
to retire was received in the service
of the University. His familiar
figure and leading influence will be
seriously missed on the diamond
this vear.
