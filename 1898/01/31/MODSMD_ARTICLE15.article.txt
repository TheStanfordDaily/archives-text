The Occident of the University
of California lias added its voice to
the general outcry of disapproval
of Mr. Caspar Whitney's article on
athletics in California. It is to he
regretted, however, as maybe seen
in another column, that the editor
takes occasion to belittle Stanford
in order to throw doubt 011 Mr.
Whitney's statement regarding fac
ulty enforcement <>112 standards of
scholarship upon the athletes of
the two universities, Mr. Whitney
regarding Stanford in the more
favorable light in this respect.
Both universities agree that Mr.
Whitney's article was probably
written upon scant information
and knowledge of the real condi
tions existii.'g at the two universi
ties, and we think the editor of the
Occident has fallen into the same
error regarding Stanford. We know
no instance of an athlete enter
ing Stanford after failing in the
U. C. entrance examinations, and
doubt if such a statement can be
substantiated. We do know that
the entrance qualifications of Stan
ford are well adapted to keeping
out unscholarly students, and,
further than that, a student, when
once in the University, has to
maintain a standard as high as
that in any large Eastern univer
sity. An athlete at Stanford re
ceives no consideration because he
is an athlete; in fact, his scholar
ship is subjected to closer scrutiny
for the reason of his prominence in
ath elics.

The misapprehension of the gen
eral public as to the athletic
methods of universities necessi
tates the above statement as to
Stanford methods more than the
Occident editorial. Almost every
student, perhaps, has been ques
tioned whether leading athletes in
the University receive salaries, and
the general idea is prevalent that
athletes receive good pay, do no
college work, and lead luxurious
lives. It is the duty of college stu
dents and college publications to
combat, wherever found, such mis
taken notions regarding college
athletics.
