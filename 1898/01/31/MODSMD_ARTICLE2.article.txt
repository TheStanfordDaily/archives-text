# Basket-ball Team Wins.
## 
### 
The hundred or more students
who grouped themselves on fences,
benches, and box-cars around the
Roble ball grounds on Saturday
forenoon, witnessed a short but
lively game of basket-ball. The
occasion was the visit of live mem
bers of the basket-ball team of the
Lowell High School who wished to
see Stanford and try some out-door
playing. Considering that this
was their first experience out of
doors they made a good showing,
though the live Castilleja players
and our own girls showed superior
strength and agility throughout.
In spite of the fact that there was
little interference on either side,
only one goal was made, that by
Winnifred Morgan, '01, so that
when time was called the score
stood 2 to 0 in favor of Stanford.

The Stanford team was composed
as follows: Misses Frances Tucker,
captain, Winnifred Morgan, Helen
Shelley, Emily Dole, May me Mer
ritt, Ida Thompson, Ida Wehner,
I arnie Hamilton, and Lena Ducker.
From Lowell were: Misses Susan
M. Kingsbury, Holmes, Cole, Board
man, and Murray. In addition,
five young ladies from Castilleja
Hall, Palo Alto, took part.
