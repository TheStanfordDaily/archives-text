# The 						George Junior Republic.

### 
The lecture on the George Junior
Republic to be given by Miss Mar
garet E. Sclia lien berger tomorrow
night will be an account of a novel
method of reclaiming incorrigible
children now in vogue in New
York.
The George Junior Republic is a
community of boys and girls from
twelve to sixteen years of age situ
ated about ten miles from Cornell
University. These children have
the full governing power of their
little community and carry on
their affairs in true democratic
fashion. The lecture will probably
be illustrated by stereopticon
views.
