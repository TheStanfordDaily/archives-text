# Ladies' Mandolin Club.
## 
### 
Repeated calls have been made
through the columns of this paper
for those young women who could
play either mandolin or guitar to
come forward and lend their
strength to the Ladies' Mandolin
Club. Yet throughout last semester
only two recruits were added, not
enough to compensate for those the
club had lost through graduation
and other causes. The present
small membership, and especially
the deficiency of first mandolins,
makes it seem impossible for the
club to maintain itself, even with
the efficient leadership of Mr. Lan
agan, its last director. More re
cruits are needed in order to place
the club on a firm footing.
