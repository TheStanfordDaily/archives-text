Iliisebull Managers Keesling of

Saturday and arranged the schedule
for the intercollegiate baseball
games for 1898. The games will
be played on the Eighth and Harri

In addition to arranging the
dates for the intercollegiate con
tests the managers effected the for
mation of a third team composed
of the alumni of both colleges, this
team to be the third member of a
league with Stanford and Berke
ley.
The alumni team will be com
posed of such men as Harrelson,
Lewis, McLaine, Sheehan, and Cal
houn of Stanford, and Allen, Mc-
Kee, Holliday, and Elston from
University of California. The ob
ject of the league is to give both
colleges practice and increase inter

bounds of amateurism.
The league games will be played
in Central Park, San Francisco,
between the alumni and the Stan
ford and Berkeley teams on alter
nate Saturdays, the first game tak
ing place next Saturday, Feb. o,
between Stanford and the alumni
team.
In addition to the games ar
ranged with the alumni team, Stan
ford will also play as last year a
schedule of games with Santa Clara
College, though the dates of these
contests have not as yet been de
cided upon.
The class games this year prom
ise to be of more than usual in
terest, as all the teams are particu
larly strong. The games will prob
ably be played off during this week
and next.
