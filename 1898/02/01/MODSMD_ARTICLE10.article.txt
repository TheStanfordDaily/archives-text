# The 						Cooper Students.
## 
### 
An item in the I>aily Palo Alto
regarding the Cooper students at
Stanford may have been mislead
ing as to their motives in entering
the University. While they re
ceive credit at Cooper's for their
work done here, yet they in no way
shorten their medical course.
As they have all been stu
dents in the medical college
for at least a year, the opportunity
of shortening their medical course
is past. They are all excellent stu
dents and are not at Stanford mak
ing up college deficiencies, but are
here to strengthen their general and
medical education, and in order
to accomplish this have denied
themselves the whole of their va
cation, as they resume their studies
at Cooper's at the beginning of the
long term next June.
