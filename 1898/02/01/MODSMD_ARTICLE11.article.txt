# Sophomore Cotillion.
## 
### 
The Class of 1900 met in the
chapel this afternoon and decided
by motion to give the usual Sopho
more Cotillion sometime during
this month. The committee to
whom is given the power of select
ing a date for the event and mak
ing all necessary preparations, will
be announced by the president
through the Daily Palo Alto. In
asmuch as a baseball game has
been arranged to take place on the
campus the afternoon of the day
upon which the cotillion is usually
given, February 22, the date will
probably be set at February 21.
