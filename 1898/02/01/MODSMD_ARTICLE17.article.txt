From newspaper reports it is
evident that the U. C. chess men
are determined to maintain the
championship won last year for
the first time. A tournament is in
progress, and great interest is being
manifested. Precisely the opposite
state exists at Stanford, except
among a very few students. Un
less greater interest is aroused in
this intercollegiate event, Stanford
will surely meet defeat. The Chess
Club has charge of the arrange
ments of the tournament in which
the Stanford team will be chosen,
aud every one having a knowledge
of the game should feel it his duty
to contest in the tournament.
