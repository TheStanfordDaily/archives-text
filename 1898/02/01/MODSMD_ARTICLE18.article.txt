# An "Occident" Editorial.

The current issue of the U. C.
Occident in an editorial condemn
ing Caspar Whitney's recent arti
cle on California athletics, has the
following of interest to Stanford
students: "As to the differences in
amateur standing which Caspar
Whitney is pleased to make be
tween the two universities, they
are merely a palpable and awkward
effort to gain the support of the one
against the other. At both univer
sities do the facilities insist on pure
amateurism. For our part we
know that our faculty is pitilessly
severe toward athletes. There may
he some differences caused by the
internal organizations of the uni

verities. For instance, time and
time again have athletes entered
Stanford after failing in the en
trance examinations at California.
We believe that, at Stanford, less
attention is paid to entrance quali
fications than at California, elimi
nation of unscholarly elements tak
ing place after entrance. This is
certainly not in onr favor, although,
we think, not at all prompted by
athletic motives. Hut enough of
this. If there exist a difference in
amateur standard at the univer
sities, we are certainly willing to
accept ihe ratio of Mr. Whitney:
California is to Stanford in athletic
purity as the State of California is
to the East. With what we know
of Eastern athletic methods, this
ratio is eminently flattering to us."
