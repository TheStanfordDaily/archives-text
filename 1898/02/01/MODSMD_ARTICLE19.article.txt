# U.C. Students Pass Resolutions.
## 
### 
Football Manager Brown of Ber
keley was sustained yesterday in
his stand against the IT. C. faculty
athletic committee. Professors E.
B. Ciapp and Thomas 11. Bacon
were the two members who es
pecially incurred the disapproval
of Brown and bis supporters. The
resolutions offered by the Brown
faction and carried by a vote of SI
to 40, set forth the lack of
harmony between the faculty ath
letic committee and the students,
and petitioned President Kellogg
to appoint a new committee, con
sisting of Professors Walter E.
Magee, George C. Edwards, and
Sydney A. Cloman.
Editor Hopper of the Occident op
posed the resolution, stating that
lie believed the movement was
prompted by a dislike of amateur
ism.
