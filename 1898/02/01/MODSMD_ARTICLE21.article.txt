Dr. Julius Goebel, head of the
German department, lias heen
honored by being appointed to edit
the unpublished works of the late

German scholar. It was through the
efforts of Dr. Goebel that the great
library collected by Hildebrand
was added to the Stanford library,
thereby greatly increasing its util

languages,and philology. The un
published works to be eelited by
Dr. Goebel comprise letters, lec
tures, essays, and more or less
technical treatises on German
grammar. Goethe, Schiller, and
other German authors are discussed
in the essays. The editing of the
Hildebrand works will consume
about three years, but will not re
quire Dr. Goebel's absence from the
University or a cessation of his Un
iversity work.
