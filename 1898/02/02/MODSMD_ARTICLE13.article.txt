Thk report of the training house
committee will go before the Exec
utive Committee this evening for
final action before it goes to the
student body for confirmation and
support. It is the duty of all stu
dents to familiarize themselves
with the facts in regard to the athf
letic house, so. as to be able to act
intelligently when the matter
comes up. The consensus of opin
ion seems to favor the building of
the house, and if it is done the stu
dent body should stand by the
proposition and put the house at
the disposal of our athletes as
soon as possible.
