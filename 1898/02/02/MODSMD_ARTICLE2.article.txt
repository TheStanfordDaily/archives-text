The lecture last evening by Miss
Margaret E. Schallenberger on the
George Junior Republic was one of
the most interesting and entertain
ing given in the chapel this year.
The audience while not very large
was appreciative. It is impossible
to reproduce the wit and interest of
the lecture in the following brief
abstract.
The George Junior Republic is
situated on a farm ten miles from
Ithaca, N. Y., and was founded by
William R. George, a young busi
ness man. The citizens of the Re
public are children, mostly incor
rigibles. During the summer about
two hundred children are accom
modated on the farm, forty remain
ing throughout the year. The Re
public originated through Mr.
George's love for humanity, domi
nated by his reason. In 1890 he
took a few children from New York
City to his home on the farm, and
every year he has gradually in
creased the number.
All the while he tried to teach
them to work, but it was hard, dis
couraging work; the children were
hard to entertain and were hard
ened, selfish little creatures, coming
to his home mostly for the presents
given them. Later he made the
children work and paid them for
it; and then to pay for every
thing they received. In 1895 the
idea of a self-governing community
struck him and he put the Repub
lic in operation.
The idea usually gained from
magazine articles is that it is a
finely wrought scheme, in good
working order, but in reality it is

in a state of experiment, of chaos;
Mr. George is constantly working
for improvement.
The youthful citizens of the Re
public are divided into states, each
state corresponding to an industrial
class. Each state elects a senator
to the senate fora term of two
weeks. The representatives are
elected according to the population
of the state and serve one week.
The Republic also has a president,
a judge, and a police force. The
laws made by the children are
those that govern the community,
and the results are interesting. Mr.
George never interferes, and the
children work out their own salva
tion. In the Republic all the
problems of our larger government
are worked out in miniature.
Questions of the tariff, free-coinage
of tin (their money), women's
rights, and the treatment of pau
pers have all been met and dealt
with by the youthful statesmen.
The policy of the entire regime
is to teach the children by experi
ence, and to soften the bitterness
of punishment by allowing them to
punish themselves through laws of
their own execution. The scheme
is live, but it derives most of its
success from the patience and per
severance of Mr. George and his
policy of non-interference.
