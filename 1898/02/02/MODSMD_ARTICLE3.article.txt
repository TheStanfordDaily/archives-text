# Training House Committee Will Report.
## 
### 
The training house committee
met this afternoon and decided to
report to the Executive Committee
this evening. The proposition
which will he made is for the stu
dent body to erect a building im
mediately, to cost not more than
$1,500. There is sufficient money
in the treasury to begin the work,
and the amount which will have to
be borrowed can be determined
later on, when all of the outstand
ing accounts have been brought in
to the treasurer.
No selection was made by the
committee from the plans which
were before them, as many changes
must be made in any of them be
fore they would be acceptable.
What is now desired by the com
mittee is the official backing of the
student body in order that definite
arrangements may be made and
the work started immediately.
