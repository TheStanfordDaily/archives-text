# Inter-Class Baseball Games.
## 
### 
An inter-class baseball schedule
was arranged this afternoon in a
conference between Baseball Man
ager Keesling and Managers Cran
clall, '99, and Potter, '01.
The schedule is as follows:
Monday, February 7 —Juniors vs.
Freshmen.
Wednesday, February 9—Seniors
vs. Sophomores.
The winning teams will meet the
following week to decide the class
championship. An admission fee
of ten cents will be charged.
Manager Keesling had been at
tempting to arrange a Varsity
game with Santa Clara on the
campus for tomorrow afternoon,
but Santa Clara was unable to
play. There will be no game to
morrow, other than the usual prac
tice game.
