# THE 						MASTER'S DEGREE.
## Question of its Abolition Debated Before the University Council. 
### 
The University Council met yes
terday to decide upon the question
of abolishing the degree of Master
of Arts at Stanford. The result of
the conference has not yet been
ascertained, as all of the members
of the Council were not present at
the meeting.
Those not in favor of the Master's
degree urge the aboliti n of it in
the interests of academic simplicity
and genuine scholarship. The fol
lowing is a summary of the report
offered opposing the granting of the
degree, signed by Professors Elliott,
Jenkins, and Hoskins:
Of all academic degrees, that of
Master has the least significance in
universities. It is historically, in
America, a purely honorary degree,
having no reference to graduate
study. The more common con
ferring of the degree "in course" is
only another form of the honorary
degree.
The attempt has been made to
save the Master's degree by making
it the label for one year of resident
graduate study directed toward
a definite end. Speaking generally,
a year of graduate study can be
only the beginning from the point
of view of the scholar. Nothing
worthy to be called a contribution
to knowledge can be reached in
one year of graduate study. At
the University of Pennsylvania,
taking this institution as a type, it
is provided that this year of grad
uate work must be divided equally
among three subjects. Such a reg
ulation must, generally speaking,
work a positive injury to graduate
study and serve to defeat the very
object of such'study.
It will be admitted that the de
grees of Bachelor of Arts and Doc
tor of Philosophy stand for defi
nite and well defined academic
ideas. The Bachelor's degree is
the university's certificate of the
conventional four years of under
graduate study. The Doctor's de
gree is the certificate of the com
pletion of a prolonged course of
original investigation and research
resulting in a positive contribution
to knowledge.
The minority report of Professor
Pease in favor of its continuance
is summarized below:
The Master's degree is at present
the most widely sought academic
degree offered to graduates; in fact,
few institutions are in a position to
give the Doctor's degree.
Four hundred and five Master'n
degrees in residence were awarded
by twenty-three of the leading in
stitutions in this country, and there
is an earnest attempt on the part
of those institutions to make the
Master's degree represent a certain
real and definite attainment ; and
as long as these continue to confer
this degree on the present basis, so
long will it have a certain commer
cial value in the minds of teachers
and trustees.
The intrinsic value of the degree
is felt by every instructor who com
pares the spirit of the candidate for
a degree with those who are work
ing with no such end in view. All
feel the Doctor's degree to be pre

eminently the award for original
research, an award which should
he given only rarely. Therefore
without the Master's degree there
would be no mark to put on that
large and worthy class who aim
rather to follow in the footsteps of
others, those who are to be teachers
in our own secondary schools.
In this country we may expect
to see a gradual advance both in
the attainments of our teachers and
in the requirements of the Master's
degree until it shall represent the
same high standard as the Doctor's
degree—then and not till then we
believe will it have served its use
fulness.
