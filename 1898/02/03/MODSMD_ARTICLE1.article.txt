# EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.
## Very Important Business Transacted at the Meeting Last Evening. 
### 
The Executive Committee of the
Associated Students held its regu
lar monthly meeting last evening
and transacted some very impor
tant business. An appropriation
of $25 was made for the building of
a bicycle track, and the purchase
of the piano belonging to the
Choral Club was authorized.
Treasurer l'omeroy was present
at the meeting and made an esti
mate of the financial condition of
the student body. The amount of
money on hand is $2,100; outstand
ing obligations, $600; money due
the Associated Students from the
football souvenir and training
table, $500. Treasurer Pcmeroy
stated that at the end of the year
the student body would have about
$1,000 to its credit above all the
expenses of the year, with the ex
ception of the treasurer's commis
sion. The appropriations made
last night will materially reduce
this eßiimate.
Manager McNeil of the musical
clubs appeared before the committee
and secured permission to arrange
a joint concert with the musical
clubs of the University of Califor
nia. on the evening of the inter
collegiate field-day, which will
probably take place on April 23.
This will bring three intercollegiate
teams in contact within a day's in
terval, the musical clubs, the track
teams, and the debating teams, as
the Intercollegiate Debate will
probably take place the night of
the field-day.
The training house committee
made a report recommending that
a meeting of the student body be
held in order to secure its sanction
for the further prosecution of the
plan, as the committee felt that
nothing further could be accom
plished without the authorization
of the student body. The com
mittee laid the matter on the table
until more definite estimates of the
cost could be obtained, and the fi
nancial condition of the student
body could be more accurately as
certained.
