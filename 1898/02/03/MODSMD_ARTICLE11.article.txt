The Executive Committee took
unfavorable action in the matter
of the training house at the meet
ing last night. In view of the fact
that our financial situation at the
end of the year can not now he ac
curately determined, and, further
more, that any building that might
be done now would be of no use to
the men in training for the spring
contests, unless it were very loosel v
done, there is no doubt that the
committee acted wisely. The sen
timent of the student body, as ex
pressed through the Daily Palo
Alto, was in favor of building the
house. The committee is also fav
orable to the proposition, but
thinks that the student body
should wait until the end of the
year, when they will be certain of
their financial status. In the light
of mature consideration it seems
that the position of the committee
is wise. We do not wish to build
a training house until we can
build a proper one, and, at the
same time, see where we stand in
a financial way. The way will, in
all probability, be clear at the end
of the year, and next fall ought to
see a good training house at the
disposal of our athletes.
