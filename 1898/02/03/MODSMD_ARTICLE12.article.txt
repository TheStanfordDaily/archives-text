The final result of the vote of
the University Council sustaining
those in favor of continuing the
degree of Master of Arts by a bare
majority, was a victory for conserv
atism, which almost every student
in the University hoped would he
won. It can safely be said that
Student sentiment is in favor of the
Master's degree. Almost every
student has a wholesome respect
for the degree, as representing a
year of hard, original work. The
abolition of the degree would have
tended to remove part of the in
centive to sustained graduate work,
â€¢and also to lessen in a very consid
erable degree the attraction which
Stanford has as an institution for
graduate work among Eastern col
lege students. Students who intend

to enter the profession of teaching
find that the degree of Master of Arts
from a reputable institution is an
additional recommendation, indi
cating, as it does, riper and more
mature scholarship than the A. B.
degree, whose very commonness
has lowered its repute. The abo
lition would undoubtedly have re
sulted in driving to other institu
tions oi learning many of our very
best students, simply for the fact
that they desired to receive a tangi
ble recognition for the work they
accomplished, in addition to
the rewards of true scholarship.
The accompanying debate and dis
cussion, while resulting in the
triumph of conservatism, will
have accomplished much toward
progress, if the Master's degree is
rendered, in any way, of greater
utility to the student.
