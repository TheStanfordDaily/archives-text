# Smith Elected Captain.
## 
### 
At a meeting of the '99 baseball
men this afternoon Rea Smith was
unanimously elected captain of the
Junior team, The meeting brought
out quite a large number of men,
and Captain Smith thinks that
with these and others whom he has
in view, '99 should make a good
showing in the inter class cham
pionship series. Manager Crandall
lias arranged a practice game with
the faculty nine to be played Satur
day morning at 10:80 o'clock on
the faculty diamond in the arbor
etum, in order to put the '99 team
in good order for the game with the
Freshmen Monday afternoon. The
Juniors will probably line up as
follows for Saturday's game: Hig
ley, catcher; Crandall, pitcher;
Young, fir t; Gregory,second; Har
ris, short; R. Smith, third; P.
Smith, left-field; Van Kaathoven,
center-field; and Pecker, Perry, or
Forsythe, right-field.
