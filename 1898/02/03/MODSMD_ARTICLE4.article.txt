# GOSSIP OF THE TRACK.
## Many Men Are Out Doing Good Work, but More Are Needed. 
### 
Work on the track is progressing
regularly and smoothly. The old
men are all out and are apparently
in very good form for this time of
the year. There is more new ma
terial than it has been a Stanford
track captain's fortune to secure
for several years. It is encourag
ing, too, that among the new men
there are some who are going to
give the veterans a hard run to re
tain their places, for this year the
result of the field-day will be to a
very large extent dependent upon
second and third places.
According to all appearances at
present there is going to be this
year what no man now in college
has seen, a hard contest for places
on the team as distance men.
There is an excellent lot of men
training for both the half and mile.
Last night Williams and Coolidge
ran through a sharp half in very
good shape. Daggett was on the
track for the first time, doing slow
work. All the other men were jog
ging in squads. Oilman, '99, has
been training in the forenoon.
Charles Fickert was giving the
hammer a few preliminary tosses
so as to get his muscles used to the
work. Ed Oilman has been in bed
for over a week with a lame back
from a fall some time ago, and so
has been prevented from working
with the weights. He was doing
well up to that time. A good
many men are experimenting with
the shot and some show signs of the
necessary combination of strength
and agility.
The pole was taken out for the
first time and several men were
vaulting. It is too earlv yet to say
what are the possibilities of any of
them.
Brunton is giving instruction at
present in starting. He has an
awkward squad, but already he has
picked out two or three men whom
he says will bear watching. Birtch
yesterday showed his old tendency
to get off the mark before the pistol
makes it lawful.
Morgan and Culver are finding
again their old-time limberness.
Morgan thinks he has found an
embryo 120-yard hurdler in Dut
tun. More men should be trying
in this event.
The Executive Committee has
authorized Manager Gregory to
build a bicycle path inside the
running track, and very soon the
bicycle squad, which is of creditable
size and ability, will be able to
whirl around as fast as it pleases
without any danger of depriving
the team of any valuable men try
ing for this or other events.
