### 
—The graduates of Harvard
have formed a graduate athletic
association. The object is to stim
ulate interest in athletics and to
advise in the matter of varsity
sports.
—A series of inter-class debates
has been arranged at Pennsyl
vania, the freshmen debating with
the sophomores, and the juniors
with the seniors. Each class held
preliminaries in which their tea\ns
were selected by judges. The
question to be debated in these
contests is the intercollegiate ques
tion to be debated with Cornell.
This plan has been adopted to
arouse interest in debating at
Pennsylvania through the medium
of class pride and class spirit.
