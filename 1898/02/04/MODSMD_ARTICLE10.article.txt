# SENIOR BENEFIT.
## Program for Tomorrow Evening's Entertainment in the Chapel. 
### 
The "church sociable" entertain
ment for the benefit of'9B will be
given tomorrow evening in the
chapel. The program is a de
parture from the usual style of en
tertainment. Its unique character
is one of its greatest features, being
much after the style of an old
church sociable. The best talent
of the University colony has been
engaged for the occasion.
The University public will have
an opportunity to hear new im
personations by several stars and
staresses. Mr. Riley will appear
and disappear in a line of work in
which he has not before been heard
here. Briscoe's impersonation of
Hans Ogelhimer is one of the best
things the jocose sophomore has
ever undertaken. It will take him
a little under five minutes. "Kill"
Irwin will do an exciting bit of ro
mance in real life. This alone is
worth the price of admission.
The company has been strength
ened by the addition of Miss Dink
elspiel as a reciter, together with
Misses Jagger of Palo Alto, Metz
ger of Radcliffe Hall, and Miss
Zucker, all of whom are finished
artists in their line. The 112 >llowing
