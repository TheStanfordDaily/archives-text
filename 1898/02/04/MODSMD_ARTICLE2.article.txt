# Why the Carnot Was Postponed.
## 
### 
Ever since the Carnot Debate
was postponed from the date orig
inally fixed, February 4, to Febru
ary 11, every one has been trying
to find out the reason why.
Last Friday, when according to
the original agreement the question
was to have been announced, the
Daily Palo Alto was informed
that it had been postponed through
an "inadvertence'' of the faculty
committee of the University of
California in making the an
nouncement. A telegram had
been received at Stanford the even
ing of January 27, from Professor
Bacon of Berkeley, announcing
the fact. This was accepted in
good faith, and, while wonder was
aroused, we kept silent.
The reason of the postponement
comes from a Berkeley source. The
following, under the head "Carnot
Debate Postponed," from the Cali
fornia)!, of yesterday, February 8,
solves the mystery: "The date of
the Carnot Debate has been
changed. It was to have taken
place on February 4, but owing to
the short space of time that date
would allow for Berkeley preparation
an agreement has been made to
postpone it until the 11th. The
inter-class debate, which had also
been fixed for the 11th, will prob
ably be put off for a week." [The
