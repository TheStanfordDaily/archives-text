# From the "U. of M. Daily."

### 
â€”After the Michigan-Chicago
game it was discovered that Stuart,
Michigan's star half-back,had never
matriculated at the University of
Michigan, having never paid his
fees nor had any connection with
the university. Stuart played
with U. of M. team for two months
and left immediately after the last
game, when the above facts were
opportunely discovered. Now the
board of control of Michigan's
athletics is endeavoring to purge
itself from blame by conducting an
investigation in order to locate the
responsibility of the fraud and also
to discover the guilty parties. Thus
a problem of "football ethics" has
arisen.
