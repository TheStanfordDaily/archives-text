# JUNIORS DEFEAT FACULTY.
## Professors Go Down Before Students in a Loosely Played Game of Ball. 
### 
In a hotly contested but rather
loosely played game of baseball,
the '99 team defeated the Faculty
last Saturday by one run.
Both sides batted heavily, al
though the Faculty men were not
afforded much of an opportunity to
exhibit their stick work, eighteen
of them walking to first base on
balls. With the exception of Dr.
Angell's phenomenal stops of
grounders, there were no star plays
made during the entire game.
Cameron, '01, caught for the Fac
ulty. At first Crandall and Higley
formed the battery for the Juniors,
but after two innings were replaced
by Forsythe and Smith, who, how
ever, did not have much better suc
cess, and Crandall was again put
in the box for the last inning.
A small but appreciative crowd
viewed the game from the side-lines
and encouraged the Faculty play
ers with their famous '"cigars" yell
The game only lasted five innings,
as the score was becoming so large
as to look disreputable.
The teams were composed as fol
lows:
