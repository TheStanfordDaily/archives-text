The announcement of the date
of holding the University field-day,
March 12. should give the men,
and especially the new candidates,
something to work for. Upon the
showing made in this field-day
some idea of the respective merits
of the men may be obtained, which
will largely determine the make-up
of the team. The Freshmen have
also something to look forward to
in the meet with the Oakland High
School, and, in all probability, an
additional meet will be arranged
with the Sophomore team. With
these meets in view, the number of
candidates from the Freshman
Class should be largely augmented.
