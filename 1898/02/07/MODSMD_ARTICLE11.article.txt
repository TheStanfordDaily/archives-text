The finance committee of the
Senior Class deserves great credit
for its efforts in untangling the fi
nances of the '98 Annual. The en
tertainment given by the class
Saturday evening was both an ar
tistic and financial success. The
sooner the Senior Class places its
affairs upon a sound financial basis,
the better it will be for the mem
bers arid for the following classes.
The public and the business men
are getting tired of waiting several
years for the University classes to
pay their debts, and the unusual
demands made upon the manage
ment of the Junior Annual is to be
traced directly to this feeling. The
lower classes of the University
should profit by the experience of
past and upper classes, and by
placing efficient and capable men
in charge of their financial affairs
establish a record of good business
management, and thus also keep
from injuring the University's
name in neighboring communities.
