# Rates for the Carnot.
## 
### 
J. E. McDowell, agent for the
Southern Pacific at Stanford, has
obtained a rate of $1.25 for the
round trip between Palo Alto and
San Francisco for those intending
to be present at the Carnot Debate
at Stiles Hall, Berkeley. To se
cure this rate an order must be ob
tained at the Registrar's office.
Students intending to attend the
debate should hand their names
either to E. 11. liothrock, president
of the Inter-Society Debating
League, or J. E. McDowell, as it is
desired to form an estimate of the
number of persons going from Stan
ford. The student body of Berkeley
has appointed a committee to re
ceive the Stanford visitors, and it
is at the request of this committee
that the number is being ascer
tained. Many students have al
ready signified their intentions of
going and the number will prob
ably be between one hundred and
and hundred and fiftv.
