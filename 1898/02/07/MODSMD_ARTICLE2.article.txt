While every student who regis
ters for work in the gymnasium is
measured by the familiar method
of tape and caliper, certain special
cases have been given the advan
tage of the improved photometric
method, which has been in process
of evolution in the north gallery of
Encina gymnasium since January
last.
The work was instituted by I)r.
Wood, who has spared neither
time, interest, nor money, in his
untiring efforts to make it success
ful. It has been from the first in
sole charge of S. G. Bailie, '99, to
whose inventive powers the im
provements are due which make
the system superior to any now in
use. Mr Bailie has also been at
work on a system by which scien
tific study may be made of criminal
types, and by which criminals may
be identified. This plan Mr. De

Pue of Sun Quentin investigated
during a recent visit here, and pro
nounced to he certain of success.
Light is admitted to the studio
through windows in which white
tissue paper has been substituted
for frosting, as giving a purer light.
Colors containing red are un
favorable to the best results in any
branch of photography. For this
reason the redwood walls of the
studio are everywhere covered. Op
posite the windows they are hidden
with pale blue cloth to soften the
light; on another side with white
so that the reflected will be
properly diffused. By joining the
blue and white areas overhead a
suitable top light is obtained. The
light is further regulated by means
of movable screens, which may be
so arranged as to make the outline
of the figure stand out everywhere
with equal clearness against its
dark background. The effect in
the finished photograph of having
the background appear to be a con
tinuous plane is gained by extend
ing the dark gray canvas of the
background several feet to the
front along the floor.
Previous to taking pictures the
following is done: A black screen
marked off with white lines into
squares five centimeters on a side,
with centimeters marked on one
margin, inches on the other, is
placed at the exact distance from
the camera at which the subject
will stand later. A negative of the
screen is then made, and by means
of a clever mechanical device
within the camera, the picture is so
taken that the final photograph
shows the figure of the subject with
clearly defined lines apparently
superimposed.
The subject stands on a level plat
form upon which are cleats so ar
ranged that his feet are placed at
an angle of fiO degrees, and the
center of his body is directly over
the pivot on which the platform re
volves.
The simple photographing of the
human form has been carried on
by physicians and others before,
but no previous system gave meas
urements of such absolute a curate
ness, or made proportions so easy
to compute. And the relation of
proportion to mobility and power
is one which physical trainers need
every help in studying. A very
great advantage of Mr. Bailie's
method is that it can be used any
where, with any camera, with com
parable results.
Scientific photometry will also
assist the working out of type
forms by means of composite photo
graphs, with which the individual
may be compared. Furthermore,
both the type and the individual
are graphically represented, giving
one not only a concrete idea of the
development of any one system of
muscles, but of the relation of one
system to another.
With its present limited means
the department of Hygiene can
make but little practical applica
tion of photometry. With money
and assistants it could place in
the hands of each student knowl
edge of himself which would en
able him, under proper guidance,
to pursue a consistent course of ex
ercise calculated to better his phys
ical condition steadily throughout

his college course. As photometry
does not give circumferences, it can
never entirely supplant the old sys
tem. But to do away with even
half the tape measurements would
be a great saving of time and cost.
Under the old system one operator
could measure eight to ten subjects;
with the camera two operators can
take lifty subjects a day, three
views each. This saving of time
would make it possible for each
student to be measured at stated
intervals, thus ascertaining the ef
fect of certain exercises and sports
upon certain groups of muscles.
