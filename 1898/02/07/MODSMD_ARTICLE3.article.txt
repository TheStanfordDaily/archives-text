The entertainment for the bene
fit of the i) 8 ' \nnual drew ti large
crowd to the chapel on Saturday
evening, although it was raining
heavily outside. As usual with
such performances the show did
not begin until long after the ap
pointed time and, once started, did
not end until after ten o'clock, be
cause of the numerous encores.
The crowd was sympathetic, the
recitations exceptionally line, and
the excellent specialities often
brought down the house.
After the opening piece, "El
Capitan," by the Glee and Mando
lin Clubs combined, Herr Ungel
blatzer, late of Germany, otherwise
known as J. 8. Briscoe, '00, spun
some new yarns and made mention
of some facts which were not so
new.
Miss Metzer and John Brunton,
'99, were recipients of well-merited
applause for their nimbleness on
the piano, both of which were well
rendered.
Miss Emmabell Zucker made her
first bow to a Stanford audience,
also a decided hit. Both of her
selections were charming indeed,
her encore being decidedly clever.
The Mandolin Club showed its
ability in the ''Palm Branches" to
play music requiring expression as
well as popular marches.
W. If. Irwin, '98, very cleverly
gave "The Professor's Ball Game,"
and for an encore told an amusing
story of the backwoods.
The second part of the program
was opened by the Glee Club, and
the encore, "A Chinese Lullaby,"
disclosed the fact that Charles
I. Dillon, ex-'99, was present.
There was never a Stanford favorite
more popular than Dillon, and he
was immediately and enthusias
tically called for by the audience,
which remained unsatisfied after
two numbers.
Miss Grace Dinkelspiel, '00,
charmingly recited one of James
Whitccmb Riley's shorter poems,
and another little piece in which
there was cleverness as well as
well as truth displayed.
Mr. Frank Branch Riley, '00,
with one of his delightful imper
sonation sketches, followed the Glee
Club. As "Uncle Eph" he was a
happy type of the old darky "back
in 'ole Virginie befo' the wah."
Miss J agger of Palo Alto sang
two pretty songs, both of which re
ceived well-deserved applause.
"The Mississippi Rag" by the
Mandolin Club closed the program.
The concert was one of the best
ever given on the campus, and the
promoters deserve great credit for

both giving a very enjoyable per
formance, and clearing some $55
for the class.
