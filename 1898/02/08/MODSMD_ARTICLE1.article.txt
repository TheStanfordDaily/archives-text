# JUNIORS VS. FRESHMEN.
## First of the Series of Inter-Class Games Will Be Played Tomorrow. 
### 
The first of the inter-class games
for the championship of the Uni
versity will be played tomorrow
afternoon on the Varsity field.
The game tomorrow will be of
interest chiefly as giving an oppor
tunity to estimate the strength of
the Freshman Glass in baseball,
and also the individual ability of
some of the members of the team,
some of whom are very promising
aspirants for the Varsity team.
The '99 team has lost some of its
best men, its former Varsity men
having not returned, and Harris
having decided to play with the
'00 men. The game will be inter
esting, as the score will doubtless be
very large. An admission fee of
ten cents will be charged.
The Freshman team will give as
many men as possible a chance to
play, as there are several appli
cants for each position. Ihe teams
will be composed as follows:
'99. '01.
R. Smith c Swindells

Manager Keesling was unable to
arrange a game on the campus with
the Santa Clara team, as he de
sired, and consequently, in order
to give the Varsity team some
practice before Saturday's game
with the Alumni team, was obliged
to agree to a game on the Santa
Clara campus Thursday afternoon.
The '98-'OO game has as yet not
been scheduled, but will probably
take place Friday afternoon, and
the contest between the winners
the following week.
