The class game tomorrow prom
ises to be unusually interesting, as
it is the first game of the season,
and the class spirit aroused should
do much to make it memorable.
Juniors, and especially Freshmen,
should gather tomorrow and give
their teams encouragement. Games
have often been won merely by
good yelling.
