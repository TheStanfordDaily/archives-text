With arrangements progressing
slowly in chess circles, the pros
pects for success in the intercolleg
iate event seem to be a little
brighter. It must be remembered
that Stanford took the initiative in
adding this event to the list of in
tercollegiate contests, and for this
reason the interest should be much
greater. ]112 the chess men will de
vote themselves to a scientific study
of the game from now until the
tournament, and if every man
knowing anything about the game
will enter and make a conscientious
preparation for the preliminary
tournament, the outlook will not
be so dubious in this event.
