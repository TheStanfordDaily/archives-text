A committee lias been appointed
by the Stanford Chess Club to
meet a committee from the U. C.
Chess Club and make entire ar
rangements for the Intercollegiate
Chess Tournament, which will be
held at the Mark Hopkins Insti
tute of Art, San Francisco, during
the early part of March. The
committee, which is composed of
Earl Veuve, '99, and Carlos Ser
pas, '99, will meet the Berkeley
committee at the Mechanics Insti
tute next Friday, at which time
the date and the number of play
ers to participate in the tourna
ment will be decided. The
Berkeley men are strongly in favor
of having live or six tables, instead
of three, as last year.
The try-out tournament, being
held between members of the local
club, is in full progress. Several
games were played at the club's
meeting last night. Those showing
the best form are W hitaker, 9V),
Knecht, '99, Serpas, '99, Wright,
'01, and Foster, '01. The men are
rapidly being coached into shape,

and it is probable a better team
will be developed than was at first
expected.
