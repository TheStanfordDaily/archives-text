# LUTHER CARY COMING.
## The
						Noted Princeton Athlete Will Give a Talk Before the Track Men. 
### 
Luther Cary, the famous Prince
ton sprinter, will give a talk to the
track athletes sometime this week,
very probably on Thursday.
Through the influence of Dr. Wood,
an old friend, Mr. Cary will from
time to time visit us and will give
our athletes the benefit of his wide
experience gained both in this
country and in England. He will
of course pay particular attention
to the sprinters, with whose work
he is most familiar.
Mr. Cary will be on the track
Thursday, unless otherwise an
nounced through the Daily Palo
Alto, and it is requested by the
captain that every one be present
that afternoon, if possible, between
four and five o'clock.
While at college Luther Cary de
feated all the cracks of this country,
and during his visit to England
succeeded in lowering the colors of
some of the best men there. His
time of 9 4-5 for the hundred and
21 3-5 for the two-twenty have
held as world's records until one
was tied and the other broken by
two fifths of a second by B. J.
Wefers of Georgetown College.
