# An Athletic Conference.
## 
### 
Brown University lias invited
the leading Eastern colleges to an
athletic conference, which will be
held at Providence this month.
Pennsylvania, Columbia, Cornell,
Harvard, and probably Vale and
Princeton, will send delegates.
The conference will have 110
binding effect on the universi
ties represented, but the opin
ions expressed and the general con
clusions reached will, it is hoped,
re-act in favor of uniform regula
tions for Eastern college athletes.
Summer baseball is to be one of
the subjects discussed.
