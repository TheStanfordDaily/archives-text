President Jordan lectured in the
chapel last night 011 the "Evolution
of fishes" to such a roomful of in
terested auditors as we are accus
tomed to see at his lectures. He
preceded the lantern slide illustra
tions with a general sketch, in part
as follows:
In 1840 Agassiz was 011 the point
of anticipating Darwinism, but his
studies of fish caused him to aban
don the idea of evolution as he
conceived it, because he could not
help considering the fishes of De
vonian times higher than modern
forms. He drew his reasons partly
from the changes undergone by the
vertebral column. The shark, rep
resenting an older form, is like
reptiles and mammals in having a
neck, considerable back, and not
much tail. In some of the higher,
bony fishes the shoulder girdle is
fastened to the head, even becomes
part of the head, thus obliterating
the neck. In still more recent
forms, the pelvic girdle, which in
mammals is placed abdominally, is
shifted forward and fastened just
behind the shoulder, thus obliter
ating the back. uch a fish is lit
tle more than head and tail. What
shall we say of yet later forms
which have the pelvis joined in
front of the shoulder to the inner
angle of the lower jaw.
Agassiz was right in considering
modern fish, in a sense, degenerate,
but wrong in thinking that evo
lution necessarily means progress.
The direction of the development
of fishes has simply been adaptation
to a certain form of life. Since the
time of the shark fish have been
growing more fishy. If we were to
represent fish history by a tree it
would have to be a weeping willow,
because the latest and most special
ized forms show degradation of cer
tain parts. The higher mammals
show the character of lower fishes.
It has been more advantageous to
dwellers on land to have the hind
legs placed abdominally, and so
we have them thus in man.
The slides which illustrate this
lecture were shown last night for
the first time. The series ranges
from the lowest vertebrate to forms
exhibiting the most fantastic speci

alization, and includes many in
termediate types by which the lat
ter are to be explained.
