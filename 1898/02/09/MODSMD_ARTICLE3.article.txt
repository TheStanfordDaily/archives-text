# Track Meets for the Freshmen.
## 
### 
The track team of the University
of Nevada is trying to arrange a
tield-day with the Freshmen, to be
held at Reno, Nevada, some time
during April. While it is not defi
nitely settled, it is very probable
that the meet will take place some
time during the semester. With
the University lield-day on the
12th of March, the Freshman
0. H. S. meet on the26th of the same
month, and the Nevada match in
prospect, there should be incentive
enough to bring out all the latent
material in the Freshman Class.
There will be no Freshman-Soph
omore contest on the track this
year, because of the many outside
meets and the fear of working the
new men too hard, especially those
who will compete in the Intercol
legiate Field-day.
