The treasurer's report for Decem
ber is printed in this issue, and,
although greatly condensed, some
idea of the progress of student body
affairs may be gained. It must be
remembered that the enterprises of
the year had not even culminated
in December, and for that reason
the large balance should not be
taken to indicate a too prosperous
state of the student body treasury.
With careful financiering, and econ
omy in every department of the
student body, we shall probably
have a small balance to our credit.
With the student body out of debt,
plans for expending a surplus will
not be hard to make.
