The rumors which are floating
around at Stanford regarding our
chances in the Carnot Debate and
the general management of Carnot
affairs this year should remain
quietly at rest until after the tie
bate. While there may he some
foundation for them in fact, agita
tion does no good at this lime, when
the atmosphere surrounding the
debaters should be that most con
ducive to victory. After the debate,
however, whichever side wins, there
should be an investigation as to the
methods of conducting the Carnot
Debate, and if the present ones in
vogue seem to be unwieldy, unprac
tical, or inexpedient in any way, a
vigorous movement toward a re
form which will bring about beMer
results from the standpoint of the
student should be instituted. The
final arrangements are being satis
factorily completed, and from now
on the team should not be worried
by vain rumors, but should be en
couraged now and at the debate by
the student body's support.
