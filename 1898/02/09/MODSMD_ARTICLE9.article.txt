### 
President Phillip R. Thayer of
the U. C. Associated Students has
been authorized to appoint a com
mittee of three on debates, who will
have charge of the intercollegiate
preliminaries at California, repre
sent California on the Intercolleg

i*ite debuting committee, and as
sume charge of the details of the
Carnot Debate unprovided for by
the conditions of Baron Coubertin.
The committee will also arrange
for the reception of the Stanford
people who attend the debate. The
members of this committee so far
appointed are Joseph O'Connor,
'9(5, of Hastings, and C. E. Thomas,
'99. The Califomian says: "No
plans have thus far been made,
but it is expected that the Stanford
men will be met at the train and
driven or escorted about the
grounds."
In an editorial in Monday's issue
the Calif omian has the following:
"The Carnot Debate between Cal
ifornia and Stanford will be held
in Berkeley next Friday evening,
and we should not allow the oc
casion to pass without emphasizing
our welcome to the Stanford men
who may arrive here as supporters
of their representatives. The hospi
tality at Palo Alto is well known
to many of us and deserves signal
recognition on our part."
