According to the agreement by
which the contestants for the Car
not medal offered by Baron de
Coubertin are not to know the side
of the question which they are to
support until the day before that
on which the debate takes place,
l)r. Ross went to the city today and
made the drawings for positions
with Professor Bacon of the Uni
versity of California, and returned
in time to announce the results to
the Stanford debaters at the same
time as they were announced to the
U. C. representatives, at four
o'clock this afternoon. They are
as follows:
1. A. H. Suzzallo, '99, of Stanford,
affirmative.
2. A. ,J. Dannebaum, '98, of U. C.,

3. C. E. Fryer, '99, of U. C., affirm
ative.
4. A. R. Morgan,'9B, of Stanford,

5. Miss Anna Strunsky, '00, of
Stanford, affirmative.
(>. George Clark, '98, of U. C., nega
tive.
The judges are C. K. Murdock,
editor and publisher of the Pacific
Unitarian, Carles P. Eels, a lawyer,
and Sheldon Kellogg, also a lawyer
in San Francisco.
The question is, "Resolved, That
in the light of experience, further
extension of the French colonial
system would be impolitic."
By the terms of the debate the
struggle is for individual supremacy
and there is no necessary attempt
at team work. Each speaker has
fifteen minutes at his disposal
which he may divide in two
speeches as he sees fit. The
judges in making their decision are
required to take account of the
spontaneity, excellence of reasoning,
scholarship, style, delivery, and ac
quaintance with French politics ex
hibited by the contestant. No de
bater is allowed to read his speech
or to recite from memory.
In 1894 Baron de Coubertin
visited this Coast and was much
impressed by the two great univer
sities of the State and became
greatly interested in them. To
awaken an interest in French poli
tics, and to honor a great French
man, Carnot, who had recently
died, he decided to present a gold
medal as a prize for the winner of
an annual debate participated in by
members of the two universities on
some question connected with
French history or politics. The
medal which he offers is of gold,
designed by an eminent French
sculptor, and struck in Paris. The
name of the winner each year is en
graved upon the medal which he
receives.
The first debate took place in
our chapel April 12, 1895, on the
question, "Resolved, That Casimir-
Perier was justified in resigning the
presidency of France." The Stan
ford speakers were R. L. Sandwick,
H. D. Sheldon, and Wynne P.
Harrington. Friend, Lyser, and
Clark represented Berkeley. The
decision of the judges was unani
mous for Sandwick.

In 189(5 the debate was held in
Stiles Hall on the U.C. campus, on
February 8. The question. "Re
solved, That the centralized form
of the French government is favor
able to the stability of the repub
lic," was debated by H. D.Sheldon,
F. S, Howard, and E. I. Miller of
Stanford, and M. C. Flaherty, C.
E. Fryer, and Theodore de Laguna
of U. C. Mr. Flaherty won the
medal.
Last year the debate was held in
our chapel on February 12. The
question was, "Resolved, That the
French system of education is more
conducive to the welfare of the state
than would be a system like that
of the United States." A. B. Mor
gan, Mrs. M. G. Hood, and S. \V.
Charles represented Stanford, while
from the University of California
came 11. A. Overstreet, C. E. Fryer,
and A. C. Marks. The decision of
the judges was not unanimous.
The superiority of Morgan in ex
temporaneous works was evident,
but the style and delivery of Over
street were excellent enough to
overbalance it in the estimation of
the judges and he was awarded the
decision.
