The Carnot Debate is now ready
to be heard. The long and some
what wearisome details of Carnot
preliminaries, intercollegiate agree
ments, selection of the question,
and finally the choice of sides, made
today, are all a part of the machin
ery of the debate founded by Baron
de Coubertin in honor of the illus
trious Frenchman whose name it
bears. We should remember, how
ever, that all this time we have
been hearing of the consummation
of the arrangements for the debate:
first, that almost a score of students
were engaged in a diligent and
careful preparation for the prelim
inaries; then, after the three to
represent Stanford had been chosen,
a still more thorough research had
to be made in French history on
the general subject announced for
the debate—the French colonial

system under the Third Republic.
One week ago today the question
was narrowed down to a resolution
regarding, in the light of experience,
the wisdom of further extending
the French colonial system. With
only one more week of preparation
and with no knowledge of the side
to be supported, the debaters neces
sarily proceeded to master the argu
ments on both sides of the ques
tion. The last link of the chain
was completed when the sides were
announced today. The prepara
tion for a debate of this nature is
something terrific, the mental ath
letics and brain exercise necessary
are immense, arid whatever the re
sult, the Stanford student body
owes to the team in its efforts
toward victory a debt that can not
be repaid even in handshakes,
praise in victory, or sympathy in
the other dismal alternative —de-
feat. The student body appreciates
to the fullest extent the work of the
debaters, and we hope that the
team feels the full force of the Stan
ford spirit, the most important
requisite for victory.
