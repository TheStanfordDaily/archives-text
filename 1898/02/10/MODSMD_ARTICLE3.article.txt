ting with the reception committee

is made the following statement re
garding the seats to lie reserved for
the Stanford visitors:
"Wewill reserve at leastone hun
dred seats until fifteen minutes be
fore the meeting is called to order.
We would reserve them until later
than this but for the fact that the
number coming is uncertain and
the further fact that there will be
a large crowd out, and out early.
"During Friday afternoon we will
have at Stiles Hall a committee.
The men on this committee will be

pleased to give information regard

to escort visitors about the grounds.
"The debating committee is made
up at present of the following:

E. Kilkenny, and Joseph O'Connor.
This committee has full charge of
all matters relating to debating

those attending from Stanford must
arrive at the debate on time. In
order to get seats and also a slight
view of the 11. C. campus, no one
should leave the University later
than the 3:11 train and the city
later than the 5 o'clock ferry. The
