# Freshmen Play Ball.
## 
### 
The game played on the campus
yesterday between the Freshman
and Junior nines was somewhat of
a surprise at least as far as the score
was concerned. It was thought
that the contest would he less one
sided than it proved. The Fresh
man team played a much better
game than was expected of it and
outclassed '99 in every respect, as
the score below will show. The
fielding of the baby nine was ex
ceptionally good. The big surprise
of the game was the way in which
"Jack" Brunton pitched, lie has
staying qualities and knows some
thing of the art of fooling his bat
ters, as the three men who struck
out will testify.
The Sophomore-Senior game will
be played next Monday. The class
nine winning this contest will then
meet the '01 team, when the inter
class championship will be decided.
The score follows:
