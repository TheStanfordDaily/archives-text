# THE 						CARNOT TEAM.
## Stanford's Three Representatives in the Debate at Berkeley This Evening. 
### 
The Carnot team left this after
noon for the foggy shores of Ber
keley, accompanied by a loyal fol
lowing of Stanford sympathizers.
The debaters are in the best of
spirits, and are full of determina
tion to bring back the medal if
sincere effort can accomplish it.
The team which represents Stan
ford was chosen last semester in an
open competition, and since that
time the members have devoted
themselves to careful preparation.
A. B. Morgan, '98, is the dean of
the team, having a longer experi
ence in public speaking, and pos
sessing much native eloquence. He
was born in Utah, and was en
gaged in teaching in that State be
fore entering the University to pur
sue the study of law. He has al
ways taken an active interest in
debating affairs, as his record dur
ing the last political campaign
while president of the Bryan Club
testifies. This is the third time
Morgan has represented Stanford
in Intercollegiate debates, having
been on both the Carnot and Inter
collegiate teams last year, and he
has also been chosen a member of
this year's intercollegiate team.
As a speaker Morgan excels in
spontaneity and force of argument,
having a particularly convincing
style. Extemporaneous rebuttal
and ease of manner are among his
strong points. Morgan will speak
on the negative.
A. 11. Suzzalo, '99, will make the
opening speech of the debate on
the affirmative, and in this position
will appear to good advantage,
having the faculty of making
a strong opening argument. He has
iin easy stage presence, is ready
and forcible in his gestures. Suz
zalo is a graduate of the San Jose
State Normal School, and has had
considerable experience as a
teacher. He entered the University
with the Class of '99, and has ethics
for his major. He is a prominent
member of Euphronia.
Anna Stnuisky, '00, was born in
1878 in the village of Babinotz,
in the Vitebsk Gubernia (govern
ment) of Russia. Her early edu
cation was gained through private
tutors, with whom she studied es
pecially history, French, and Ger
man. Some years after the Russo-
Turkish war, in which her father
had been Commissary General, the
family decided to come to America,
in 1886, accordingly, the nine-year
old child found herself in New
York amid surroundings as differ
ent as can be well conceived from
those of her former royalist home.
She soon mastered the new
language, and it was not many
years before she became a contribu
tor to a radical New York weekly,
The Twentieth Century, edited then
by Hugh O. Pentecost.
After Miss Strunsky had finished
the grammer school course' and
bad been for a year at the New
York Normal College, she came, in
1895, with her parents to San
Francisco. There she attended the
Lowell High School, constantly en
larging her acquaintance outside
the school with the liberal

thinkers whose beliefs she shared,
in spite of her early training, She
was last year made secretary of the
Socialist Labor party in San Fran
cisco. Under their auspices she
has given ten public lectures on
such subjects as the following:
"Social ideals of Victor Jlugo,"
and "Relation of the individual to
society."
In September, 1896, Miss Strun
sky entered Stanford. Her tastes
having always been predominantly
literary, she made English her
major, and she hopes after gradua
tion to continue her work along lit
erary and sociological lines.
