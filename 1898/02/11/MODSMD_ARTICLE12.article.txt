There is something gratifying
to note in the fact that Stanford
and Berkeley alumni are together,
playing against the two univer
sities from which they graduated,
thus helping the playing and giv
ing good practice to each indiscrim
inately. There is a friendship be
tween the universities that is more
closely cemented by such actions
and by the courtesies extended at
such contests as the Oarnot Debate.
In fact, the fostering of this spirit
of intercollegiate good-heartedness
is a main argument that all inter
collegiate contests should be held
only 011 the grounds of the partici
pating colleges.
One can not help contrasting
this California good-will with some
squabbles of the big Eastern univer
sities, where ill-feeling finds so
many outlets, as when the Ya'ie-
Harvard bitterness was at its
height and a common and popular
note-paper heading at Harvard
consigned Yale to a warm region
not generally spoken of in polite
circles —and vice versa. We are
thankful that there is no such
spirit here.
