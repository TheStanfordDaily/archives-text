The Carnot Debate this year has
aroused more interest and enthuB«
iasm than ever before. From the
first of the college year the debate
has been constantly before the eyes
of the Stanford public. The execu
tive committee of the debating
league, with the consent of the
faculty committee, assumed charge
of the preliminaries and brought
out a large number of candidates.
Debating has always held a high
place at Stanford, as the record in
the intercollegiate events shows.
The activities of the students have
not been confined exclusively to
athletics, although we are proud of
our triumphs in the realms of
"brawn." Whatever the result of

the contest this evening, the firm
footing of the debating interests of
the University can not be denied
or called into question.
A pleasant feature of the Carnot
Debate this year is the opportunity
which it gives for a more intimate
acquaintance with our sister insti
tution. In this connection we de
sire to thank in advance the stu
dents of the university for their
hospitality in arranging for the re
ception of those going from Stan
ford, and we can assure them in
advance a cordial reception in 1899,
when the debate is held at Stanford.
