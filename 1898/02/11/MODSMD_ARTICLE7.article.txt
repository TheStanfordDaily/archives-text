# THE
						NINE DEFEATED.
## First Practice Game of the Season Won by Santa Clara College Yesterday. 
### 
The Varsity team was beaten in
its first game yesterday afternoon
with Santa Clara by a score of 10
to 8. Beckett pitched for the Var
sity and held his opponents down
to six hits. His wildness and Stan
ford's errors in the first three in
nings enabled Santa Clara to get
quite a lead. At the beginning of
the eighth it was 10 to 1 in favor
of Santa Clara, but the Varsity
struck a batting gait while the op
posing infield made errors, and
seven runs resulted in the last two
innings, Santa Clara being shut
out. Stanford's work at the bat
was rather surprising, livery one
found the ball, Wight and Young
leading in the batting. Garnot did
the best hitting, but the poorest
fielding for Santa Clara. For
Santa Clara Leake and Graham
played the best game.
Captain Lougheed is well satis
tied with the work of the team, in
view of the fact that Stanford was
beaten by a score 'if 12 to 0 in the
first game last year by a decidedly
inferior team.
