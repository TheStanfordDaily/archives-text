# A 						CALIFORNIA VICTORY.
## Charles E. Fryer Won the Carnot Medal in the Fourth Annual Contest. 
### 
The Carnot Debate Friday even
ing was won by Charles E. Fryer
of the University of California. As
Mr. Murdoek said in announcing
the decision, "It was nip and tuck,
and nip tuck it."
The debate was held in Shattuck
Hall, Berkeley, and an audience of
over eiyht hundred people was
present. About one hundred
{Stanford people were present, and
before the debate began the Stan
ford and California yells were sent
back and forth. Berkeley was
magnanimous, and gave the com
bination yell, as well as the Stan
ford yell, and the Stanford forces
reciprocated in like measure.
The debate was the same old
story of Stanford native ability,
and argumentative force set
against polish, elegance of diction,
and skillful mastery of arguments
tÂ»n the part of Berkeley. There
can be no doubt left in the mind
of any one who attended the de
bate that the Stanford team was
outclassed fairly and squarely, and
the only question over which there
was any discussion was as to which
of the Berkeley team had won the
decision. Morgan, upon whom the
hopes of Stanford rested, had
excellent arguments, and his
second speech was a strong spon
taneous rebuttal, but both of his
speeches were marred by defects in
English and rhetoric, which, in
such a contest, count very much
against the speaker. Fryer, on the
contrary, had an excellent vocab
ulary, chose his words with care,
brought out several nice dis
tinctions in the question, and was
faultless in accent and pronounci
ation, his only danger being that
of going to extremes in this regard,
often straining bis accent. These
characteristics gave an air of affec
tation and, one might almost say,
effeminacy to Fryer, and his atti
tude on the platform was not the
best. His smoothness, his diction,
caused these to be overlooked, and
he made a much better impression
on his second speech.
A. 11. Suzzallo was handicapped
by a ratbej; husky voice, and ap
peared rather nervous, as if speak
ing under a tremendous strain.
For the affirmative he proceeded
to show wherein and why France
had failed in her attempts at colon
ization, and contended that further
attempts in the light of these fail
ures would be foolhardy. He
showed the tremendous expendi
tures involved in colonizing schemes
without a corresponding return.
The timidity of French capital and
the non-colonizing nature of the
people were brought up to support
the question.
Mr. A.J. Dannebaumof Berkeley,
who opened the argument for the
negative, was, in the opinion of the
greater number of those present,
the winner of the medal. Mr.
Dannebaum's speech was logically
divided and forcibly enunciated.
He is a telling speaker with an ex
cellent. presence and easy delivery.
Dannebaum throughout his
speech re-iterated again and again
the argument that the extension of

the French colonial system was
necessary, and for the reason that
France is a colonizing nation, that
the present European situation de
mands it, and that the present sys
tem conduces to the best interest of
the republic in a military, naval,
and social sense. He gave a brief
sketch of the French colonial pol
icy showing the strength of the
French colonial spirit, and then
proceeded to show the commercial,
naval, and military advantages of
colonies to France. In Ins rebuttal
he pointed out some fundamental
inconsistencies of the affirmative
and answered the arguments which
attacked the method of government
of the colonies.
C. 10. Fryer, the winner of the
medal, insisted upon the extension
of the system as a whole instead of
along certain lines, as was argued by
Mr. Dannebaum*. He maintained
that the French people are a non
colon izing nation,and that the mili
tary sent to the colonies despised
the duty and would not give their
whole-hearted devotion to it, thus
weakening the home country in the
tirst essential.
A: B. Morgan insisted that
France should not forego the re
sults of her colonial policy. He
pointed out the advantageous posi
tion of France in the East, and
justified colonial extension histor
ically. He brought forward new
arguments to show the colonizing
ability of the French nation, and
laid great stress on the commercial
advantges to be gained by colonial
extension. In rebuttal he urged
the necessity of colonization as af
fording an outlet for French cap
ital, and showed that the political
consequences in bringing about the
Russian alliance were of the ut
most importance. France, if it
ceased to extend its colonies, would
be sure to follow dismembered
Poland.
Miss Anna Strunsky, the fifth
speaker and the last on the affirm
ative, showed that France could
not spare a colonizing population,
her birth rate being the lowest in
the world and her death rate the
highest. The people could not
support the military burden, and
the home government needed no
colonial trade, because she could
use all of her home production,
and, moreover, is not essentially an
industrial nation.
Mr. George Clark of U. C.,
the last speaker on the negative, is
a man of more than ordinary
forensic ability. His voice is not
of the best, but he excels in argu
mentative ability and puts his
points tersely and forcibly, "con
fronting" bis opponents in a. very
disconcerting way. He has a good
platform presence, and a command
of good English, with an easy de
livery. Clark was the favorite with
a number of the audience.
Clark considered the question
from an economic standpoint. Con
fronted by a stationary population,
colonization was the only possible
source of relief. Colonial commerce
would foster the industrial classes
of France. In rebuttal he answered
the argument of financial loss by
referring to England's policy. Com
mercially, industrially, and so
cially, be held, colonization was
necessary for France.
