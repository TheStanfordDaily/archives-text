# ALUMNI DEFEATED.
## First Match Game of the Season Won by the Stanford Nine Saturday. 
### 
The Stanford forces went to the
baseball game Saturday afternoon
feeling rather blue from the results
of the debate. The excellent show
ing made by the team on the dia
mond made things look brighter for
the Stanford spectators, although
the small crowd and the general
quiet gave the occasion sort of a
funereal air.
Taking everything into consider
ation, the game put up by the team
was excellent for this time of the
season. The team has, of course,
defects which it will take time to
eradicate, but these are not radical.
The batting was not heavy. Cap
tain Lougheed, Strohn, and Wight
excelled in stick work. It was evi
dent from Saturday's game that
unless several men who put up er
rorless games in fielding their po
sitions, improve in batting, their
places on the team will be difficult
to maintain. The make-up of Sat
urday's nine was such as to try sev
eral new men during the entire
game, and the same policy had been
pursued in the Santa Clara game.
The most encouraging feature of
the game was the battery work of
Lanagan and Strohn. Lanagan
had fairly good control, and pitched
a cool-headed, steady game. He
had the necessary speed and endur
ance, and, although he gave a
rather large number of bases on
balls, he made a very creditable
number of strike-outs. Lanagan
watched the bases closely, and also
fielded his position well. Strohn's
throwing to second was quick and
accurate, and many of the chances
for runs by the Alumni team were
nipped in the bud by trying to
steal second from Strohn. Strohn
caught Lanagan in good style, and
between them they were only re
sponsible for one passed ball, which,
however, netted two runs.
Stanford netted two runs in the
third inning by good batting. With
one man out, Lanagan made first
on a scratch hit to third, and
Lougheed advanced him two bases
by a clean hit to the right grand
stand. Strohn knocked a liner to
center which, through an error,
gave him three bases, and brought
in Lanagan and Lougheed. Ed
wards and Wight failed to reach
first, leaving Strohn on third.
Young made the third run in
the fourth, getting his base on balls,
tealing second and third, and com
ing in on Klauber's bit to short.
With two men out Lanagan popped
an easy Hy to McLaine.
Lougheed opened up the fifth
inning by making first on a scratch
hit to Sheehan and stealing second.
Strohn popped to Sheehan. Ed
wards was put out at tirst on an
easy assist by McKee, Lougheed
making third. Wight brought
Lougheed in by a hard, clean hit
to first. Young was put out at tirst
by McLaine.
In the sixth Harris made the last
run for Stanford. Getting his base
on balls, with one man out, he stole
second and was advanced to third
by Klauber's sacrifice hit, and came
in on a passed ball by third. Lan
agan retired the side.

The Alumni were retired in the
seventh by u pretty double play,
Edwards to Harris to Young. With
MeLaine on first and one man out,
McKee knocked a hard grounder to
Edwards, forcing MeLaine out at
second, and being himself put out
at tirst.
The Alumni team jollied up a
bit in the ninth and sent three men
over the home plate. Sheehan was
the first man up and fanned. Lewis
was given his base. Elston was
hit by n pitched ball. Lewis stole
third and Elston second. On
Allen's hit to left Lewis came in,
and Elston reached third. Allen
stole second and MeLaine was given
first on balls, filling the bases. On
a passed ball Elston and Allen both
crossed the plate. McKee drove a
long fly to Swindells who caught it
neatly, and sis quick as a Hash
threw the ball home in time to
catch Elston who attempted to beat
in the ball. Swindells'throw was the
prettiest of the game, 110 one ever
expecting Elston could be caught.
Strolin cleverly put out Elston and
retired the side, leaving Stanford
an inning to spare.
Only about a hundred and fifty
people witnessed the game.
