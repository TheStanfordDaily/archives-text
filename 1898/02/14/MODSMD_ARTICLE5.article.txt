Thh Carnot Debate wan lust fairly
and squarely Friday evening and
we can do no more than openly and
frankly acknowledge that fact. The
reason we lost the debate was
that the team was clearly out
classed, and any attempt to show
the contrary would only call into
question the spirit with which we
go into the debate. It can not be
said truthfully that there exists
widespread dissatisfaction ;it Stan
ford over the way the debate was
conducted, as was insinuated in a
city newspaper. Anyone who at
tended the debate could not help
being convinced that the medal was
won by the University of California
fairly and squarely. Any bicker
ing over the conditions and details
of the debate will only result in
putting the University in a bad
light, and accomplish no possible
good. The team did the best it was
capable of, and has the thanks of
the University just as much as if
one of the members had brought
home the medal.
The cordial reception given by
the U. C. students to the Stanford
delegation was fully appreciated
and will not be soon forgotten. We
already look forward to 1899 when
we will be given an opportunity to
repay the many favors so kindly
shown to every Stanford visitor.
Our debaters should begin at once
to plan for the reception of the
U. C. men, with a view to not over
burdening them with the golden
medal when they leave.
