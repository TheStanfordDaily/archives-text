# Visit of Luther Cary.

### 
Luther Cary visited the Univer
sity Thursday, and spent some
time on the track. He w>is well
pleased with the work of the differ
ent men whom he saw, and re
gretted that he was unable to stay
longer, in order that he might have
opportunity to meet, more of the
athletes. He was very enthusi
astic over our climate, and thought
that if a man couldn't get into
condition here he couldn't do it

anywhere. Of course, lie was un
able in his short stay to make any
definite statements about the in
dividual men, but he seemed to
think that many of them were
working too hard so early in the
season, in which surmise he is un
doubtedly correct. lie was par
ticularly pleased with the work of
Brunton, Morgan, and Dole, and
thought they would class with the
best men in their events.
Mr. Cary in his conversation
with Dr. Angell gave out many of
biß ideas on training. He spoke
of the tendency in modern times to
do away with the "raw beef" diet
and to treat each individual accord
ing to his needs. A training table
should be made, he thought, to in
duce, as well as to satisfy, the ap
petite. Mr. Cary is well qualified
to speak upon track athletics, and
upon sprinting in particular. He
sides his own extended experience
it is his yearly custom to visit the
Mott Haven games and to become
intimately acquainted with the
sprinters, and be is thus able to
keep up with the latest develop
ments along his particular line.
Personally Mr. Cary is very pleas
ant. He is an amateur in the
strictest sense of the word, and will
lie a great help to our men. He
will be down again next week.
