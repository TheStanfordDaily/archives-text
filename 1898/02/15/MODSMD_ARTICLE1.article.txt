# INTERCOLLEGIATE DEBATE.
## Arrangements for the Forensic Contest Made by the Joint Committee. 
### 
The executive committee of the
Stanford-U. C. Debating League
met in San Francisco at the Pal
ace Hotel last Saturday and made
arrangements for the Intercollegi
ate Debate. E. H. Rothrock, '98,
,). T. Burcham, '97, and S. (t.
Bailie, '99, represented Stanford,
and C. E. Thomas, L. E. Kilkenny,
and Joseph O'Connor were the
members from Berkeley. Mr.
Bailie was elected chairman and
Mr. Thomas secretary.
Mr. Thomas and Mr. Burcham
were constituted a committee of ar
rangements, with power to secure
Metropolitan Temple for the
evening of the Field-day, when the
debate will be held.
It was proposed by the Stanford
men that an admission fee of 25
cents be charged for the inter
collegiate Debate, thus putting the
debate on a self-supporting basis,
as heretofore the expenses have
been appropriated. The Berke
ley men wished time to con
sider this proposition, and if they
decide in its favor, which is very
likely, the committee on arrange
ments will charge accordingly.
It was agreed that the first list
from which judges could be chosen
must be submitted by Berkeley not
later than March 15.
Stanford lost the toss, and the
Berkeley men, using their option,
decided that we must submit the
question and that they would
choose the side. By the agreement
Stanford must submit the question
within twelve days, and Berkeley
is to announce the choice of sides
seven days later, both the question
and the choice of sides to be made
known by telegraph.
The fact that in last year'slnter
collegiate Debate Mr. Overstreet,
who was the third speaker on the
affirmative, also spoke in, rebuttal
was brought up by the Stanford
men. As regards Berkeley's action
of last year, the Stanford represen
tatives said plainly it was at least
based on a strained construction of
the agreement. They wished, how
ever, to have a definite understand
ing for the future, rather than to
provoke useless discussion of the
past; and as a policy for future de
bates, were willing that the word
" leader " in the clause referred to
may be taken to mean whichever
of the three speakers the affirma
tive desires. This interpretation
was accordingly adopted, Mr.
Rothrock dissenting.
