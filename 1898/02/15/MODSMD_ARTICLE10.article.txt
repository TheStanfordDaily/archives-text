### 
Ruble Hall was gaily decorated
and was lighted with unusual bril
liancy last Saturday night, the oc
casion being the reception to the
young men of the University. By
9 o'clock the lower hall was
crowded with groups of young folks
eagerly waiting to have the curtain
rise for the first tableau. The tab
leans, all of them taken from re
cent drawings by Gibson, included
a wide variety of subjects, and
were cleverly carried out. The hit
of the evening was made by Har
riet Hyde, who delivered a temper
ance sermon with great effect,
though the only words uttered were
the letters of the alphabet.
Before the applause over the last

tableau had fairly subsided, guests
bad begun to form in line at the
window of tlie postoffice in the
upper ball, at which each was ap
prised of the nearness of St. Valen
tine's day by a souvenir in the
shape of a valentine, comic or
otherwise.
The affair was one of the most
enjoyable ever given at Roble.
