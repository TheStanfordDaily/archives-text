The San Francisco Association of
Stanford Alumni held its second an
nual meeting and banquet Saturday
night, at a down-town restaurant.
There are in the organization about
sixty graduates of Palo Alto, and
affiliated with them are some sev
enty former students of the Uni
versity, all <>112 whom are now resi
dents of this city.
The following officers were elec
ted: President, Hugh 11. Brown,
'96; vice-president, Scott Calhoun,
'95; secretary, W. E. Stiiart, '95;
treasurer, John M. Iloss, "97.
Arrangements were also made

for the compilation and printing of
a complete business directory of
Stanford men in San Francisco for
the purpose of further increasing
the social intercourse of the mem
bers of the association, each one of
which will be furnished with a
copy of the list. — Chronicle.
Rice, '95, of the Chronicle, and
Neidig, '96, editor of the Railroad
Gazetteer, were appointed a commit
tee to compile and prepare the
directory for the printer. It. will
be published this week, probably
by the Whittaker-Ray Company,
of which C. C. Adams, ex-'96, is a
member, and of which the father of
"Chip" Ray, ex-'95, is a large
owner. The idea is to have, in a
convenient pocket folder, ar
ranged by classes and in alphabet
ical order, the names of all resident
alumni and former students, to
gether with their profession, the
concern with which they are iden
tified, their business address and
telephone, and their residence and
telephone. By this means the fel
lows expect hereafter to establish
closer relations, and they look for
ward to the possibilities of frequent
little gatherings, secured easily by
telephone, for a luncheon, a dinner,
or the theater.
Copies of this directory will be
sent to some representative Stan
ford man in every place where
there is a prospect of organizing
upon a similar plan. In this way,
and by frequent corrections of the
list, a most valuable and service
able record will be kept of a very
large number of the alumni and
former students.
At the meeting in San Francisco
Saturday night there were about
thirty old timers, principally '95
men, and a majority of them law
yers, assembled about one long
table at Jack's Rotisserie on Sacra
mento street. In addition to the
business already mentioned, ath
letic interests were discussed. Plans
were also outlined for the comple
tion by the Pioneer Class of a fund,
partly subscribed, for a fine solid
silver plate to be placed in the
quadrangle on Alumni day in
1900, on which occasion the Class
