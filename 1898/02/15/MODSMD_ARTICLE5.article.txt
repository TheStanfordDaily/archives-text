# SOPHOMORES VICTORIOUS.
## Seniors Were Easily Defeated on the Diamond by the '00 Baseball Men. 
### 
The second of the series of inter- j
class baseball games, played yester
day between the Sophomore and
Senior nines, resulted in favor of
the former team l>3 r a score of 12-2.
The bleachers were well tilled, the
members of the contending classes
making up the greater part of the
crowd, 'flie Sophs feeling surer ofj
victory than their oppcnentsi
ents were able to muster up a larger j
number of supporters. Bill Irwin,'
however, was on hand and got con
siderable noise out of his fellow
sufferers.
The game was interesting for |
several reasons. It showed the I
strength of the Glass of 1900 in I
baseball, giving the college assur-j
lance that so long as it remains, the i
Varsity nine will not be left with- ]
lout a strong nucleus around which i
I to build up future teams. The
! match also gave the three principal
'candidates for Varsity pitcher good
I opportunities to show what was in
them. Mill pitched through the
i entire game for the Seniors. His!
I control is good and his speed and
curves very fair. Beckett and
' Lanagan were in the box for the
Sophs. Between them they re
■ tired fifteen men, Lanagan striking i
! out seven men in the three innings
| he pitched.
Captain Lougheed gave another
proof of the steady, all-round man i
i that he is by his good work behind j
■ the bat.
