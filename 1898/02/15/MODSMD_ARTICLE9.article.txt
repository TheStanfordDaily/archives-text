Whatever may have been thej
motive of the Stanford representa
tives on the Intercollegiate Debat
ing Committee in agreeing with the
Berkeley delegates that the clause
of the intercollegiate agreement
which says that the ''leader of the I
affirmative" shall have ten minutes
in which to close the debate, he in- ;
terpreted so that the '"leader" may j
be allowed to speak in either thej
first, second, or third place, we be
lieve that a mistake was made.
Last year when Mr. Overstreet oft
the University of California closed
the debate for Berkeley, not being
the first speaker of the atlirniative,
the Stanford debaters held that this
was a direct violation of the inter
collegiate agreement, and the Daily
Palo Alto also took this view of
the case. Consistency on the part
of Stanford demanded a stand for a
strict construction of the agreement.
By agreeing to the Berkeley inter-1
pretation a disavowal was made of |
our stand on the matter last year,:
and we are exposed to the charge;
of having a weak, vacillating, and
inconsistent debating policy, which
in the light of circumstances is al
most a self-evident proposition. It
is only just to add that one Stan-j
ford representative opposed the
action of the committee.
