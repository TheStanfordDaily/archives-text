# WASHINGTON MEMORIAL.
## Stanford Will Assist in the Movement Toward a National University. 
### 
The twenty-second day of Febru
ary ha√ü been set apart by the
George Washington Memorial As
sociation as an "offeringday" of the
nation, at which time popular con
tributions to the proposed National
University shall be made all over
the country. Accordingly, next Mon
day evening at the meeting in tne
chapel a popular collection will he
taken up. The offering is to be
entirely voluntary, and is not the
main purpose of the meeting,
which is rather to awaken interest
in the work of the memorial associ
ation. Small contributions of not
more than twenty-live cents
are solicited. A contribution of
live cents, or even ten cents, should
not prove burdensome to any one,
in view of the cause for which it is
given. An average of ten cents
each from the members of the Uni
versity would amount to a worthy
offering. The united offering of
the different universities, public
schools, and memorial associations
over the country will make a sub
stantial contribution toward the
work of establishing the lirst build
ing in the National University in
order that every one at Stanford
may have an opportunity to "lay
a brick" in this new building, ar
rangements will be made whereby
those not present at the meeting on
Monday night can put their con
tribution in the missionary box on
the blackboard in the quadrangle.
It is hoped that every member of
the University will contribute his
or her mite to this cause.
George Washington ardently de
sired to see a beginning made by
Congress of a central university for
advanced students at the National
Capital. For this reason he be
queathed in his will $25,000 to
Congress, in trust. The trust,
however, was neglected and the
value of the legacy lost. Since
then many eminent men have at
tempted to persuade Congress to
take action toward the restitution
of the bequest, but without success.
It is the aim of the George
Washington Memorial Association,
of which there is a branch at
Stanford, to erect a memorial
building to Washington, which
shall be dedicated to educational
purposes, as part payment of a
debt of honor due to the Father of
His Country, and an acknowledg
ment of the gratitude we feel, along
the lines of that phase of our na
tional life which he so much de
sired to foster.
The women of America wish to
raise at least $2-50,000 for this
building, and they would be glad
to receive the sum in time to lay
the corner-stone in December, 1899,
one hundred years from the date
when the bequest was made.
