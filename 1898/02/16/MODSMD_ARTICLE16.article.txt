# Tuesday Evening Lecture.

### 
The lecture last evening by Pro
fessor H. R. Fairclough on "The in
tellectual character of Greek social
life" was exceedingly well thought
out and delivered. Professor Fair
elough prefaced his lecture with a
few remarks on the intellectual
character of our national life, and
then showed the debt the modern
world owes in science, literature,
and art to the Greek civilization.
The intellectuality of Greek life
was shown by the character of the
Greek national games, the Greek
comedy and tragedy, the schools of
philosophy, and the Greek home
life, from all of which the Greeks
derived purely intellectual enjoy
ment.
