# Meeting of the Zoology Club.

At the meeting of the Zoology
Club at the home of Dr. Thoburn
Monday evening Mr. Snow pre
sented a very interesting paper en
titled "Problems suggested by a
new local insect." The insect in
question is a small fly related to

the gall gnats. As it corresponds
to no known species, Mr. Snow has
given it the provisional name
Diplopia pini insignia, because it
attacks the Monterey Pine. The
pest is of interest to us because it
has become so abundant in the
arboretum during the last two sea
sons as to threaten the lives of the
Monterey pines and allied species.
The eggs are laid in the leaf buds,
and the irritation caused by the
growth of the larva makes the leaf
swell at the base, prevents it from
attaining normal length, and at
last causes it to fall. No natural
enemy has been observed and ordi
nary means of pest extermination
would be useless, so the problem is
a serious one.
