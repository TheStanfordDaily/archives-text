# SOPHOMORE COTILLION.
## Novel Features Which Are Being-Planned for the 1900 Class Dance. 
### 
Next Tuesday, Washington's
Birthday, promises to be one of un
usual interest with the baseball
game on the campus in the after
noon and the annual Cotillion given
by the Sophomore Class in Encina
gvmn&sium in the evening.
The committee having the Cotil
lion in charge are busily engaged
in perfecting the final arrangements
and nothing will be left undone to
make this year's Cotillion one long
to be remembered. The programs
for the Cotillion will be handsome
and appropriate souvenirs of the
day. They are arranged in the

shape of a folder with pencil at
tached. In the upper left hand
corner of the outside is a bust view
of Washington with a draped flag
in the background; on the back
there is the cocked hat, sword, and
cane of colonial days. Mr. Bristow
Adams, '00, furnished the design
from which the programs were
made and his work is certainly very
artistic.
There will be ten dances before
the Cotillion, eight regular and two
extras; and the music for the occa
sion is to be furnished by one of
the city's best orchestras. The
committee on favors, consisting of
Mr. J. F. Lanagan, Mr. Carl Brown,
am 1 M i.ss Alice Bailey, are planning
something decidedly new and novel
in the way of souvenirs. The other
committees who are working dili
gently to make this Cotillion a suc
cess are Misses Holmes, Bell, and
Mr. Lanagan on program and
music; and Messrs. W. W.Burnett,
R. N. Higgles, and (i. H. Woodruff
on printing. Tickets are now on
sale at the University Bookstore at
$3.00.
