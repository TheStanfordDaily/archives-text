Now that the Stanford members
of the Intercollegiate Athletic Com
mittee have been appointed, a
meeting should be arranged as soon
as possibleso that the intercollegiate
agreement governing athletics may
be revised. The fact that the inter
collegiate agreement is not suffi
ciently comprehensive to cover all
possible contingencies, gave rise
last year to a disagreeable and al
most serious intercollegiate dispute
over the number of points to be
scored in the Intercollegiate Field
day for first, second, and third
places. The settlement of the dis
pute was delayed until so near the
day of the contest, when the oppos
ing teams had been carefully sized
up, that the result of the Field-day
seemed inextricably mixed with
the adjudication of the difficulty.
The method of scoring points
should be definitely fixed in the
intercollegiate agreement, and un
less this is accomplished before the
merits of the respective teams be
come known, the same disagree
ment may arise this semester.
