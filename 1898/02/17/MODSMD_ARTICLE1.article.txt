# CAMPUS IMPROVEMENTS.
## Two Plans of Mrs. Stanford to be Executed in the Immediate Future. 
### 
It is an assured fact that the men
of the University are to have the
dining-room of Encina Hall for a
general assembly room. It is also
certain that the restaurant to be
built on the campus will be ready
for use before the end of the semes
ter. Resident Architect I lodges is
authority for both of the above
statements.
Mrs. Stanford, ever since her re
turn from the East last week, has
been devoting much of her time to
a consideration of improvements
on the campus. The fact that the
large dining-hall in Encina was
being devoted to no purpose, led to
the plan to fit it up as a general
assembly hall, for the use of the
men of the University. Work was
begun at once. The long tables,
formerly in use in the dining-room,
are now being moved out, and the
room will probably be ready by
next week.
This room is to be devoted exclu
sively to making the students' life in
Encina more comfortable and en
joyable, and also to afford greater
opportunities for social life among
the men of the University. The
room will be fitted up with two bil
liard tables, fully equipped, and
tables for periodicals, and reading,
arid writing. The piano will be
moved down from the second floor,
and as the floor is admirably suited
for dancing, in all probability the
hall will be the soence of the En
cina "stag" dances, and there are
also visions arising of pleasant ''at
homes," in which Encina might
vie with Roble for popular favor.
Several upper classmen are urging
a meeting of the Encina students,
in which a permanent organization
might be effected to assist m per
fecting the appointments of the
room, and also to appoint commit
tees and draw up rules, such as ex
ist in every social club. Many
have suggested an assessment for
periodicals, and the whole move
ment is arousing great interest in
Encina Hall.
Architect Hodges also informed
the Daily Palo Alto representa
tive that work would be begun on
the new restaurant in a few
weeks. Plans are now being drawn
up for the structure, which will be
of wood, costing somewhat less
than $5000, and large enough to
accommodate about one hundred
and fifty guests at one time. The
temporary buildings now devoted
to the architect's office, the Uni
versity Bookstore, and Rice's store,
will lie moved back of the quad on
a line with the blacksmith's shop,
and the restaurant will be erected
on the vacant location, near the
athletic field. Along the entire
front of the building there will be
a piazza, from which there will be
a good view of the field.
The building as planned will
be completed by the 15th of April.
The restaurant will be in charge of
a professional caterer from San
Francisco, and will be in operation
at least by the end of the semester.
