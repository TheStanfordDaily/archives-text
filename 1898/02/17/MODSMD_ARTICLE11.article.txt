The bare announcement in last
evening's paper of the fact that the
dining hall of Encina was to he
fitted up as an assembly room for
the University men aroused the
greatest interest among the resi
dents of Encina, and also among
the students living outside the hall.
We have always felt Ihe need of
some such central meeting place in
which the men of the University
could rally and discuss their in
terests, and this fact formed one of
the strongest arguments for the
training house, which was to in
corporate this feature. The en
thusiasm aroused is merely an in
dication of how great is the want this
innovation will satisfy.
It was suggested in one of the
groups discussing the plan last
evening that the Encina students
form an organization and appoint
the necessary committees, and draft
rules to govern the use of the club
room, so that there would be no
room for abuses of the privilege to
arise. This plan is a good one.
Mrs. Stanford has been very gener
ous in originating the plan, and
the students on their part should
co-operate in ?ivery possible way to
make it a success. Tables are to
be provided in the hall, and the
students should unite in order to
subscribe for the leading periodicals,
which will add much to the com
fort of Encina. A meeting should
be held at once to discuss the mat
ter, and to formulate some definite
plan of action. The room is to be
opened soon, and a good beginning
will go far toward putting the plan
in successful operation.
The news that the restaurant on
the campus is to be completed this
semester is only another evidence
of the desire of Mrs. Stanford and
the University authorities to pro
vide for the comfort and welfare of
the students, fcoth reforms, we
feel certain, will conduce to these
ends, as well as tend to make En
cina Hall once more the vital center
of our University life.
