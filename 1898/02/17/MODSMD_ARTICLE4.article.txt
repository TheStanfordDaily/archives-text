# NOTES OF THE TRACK.
## Commencement Upon the Week's Work of the New Men on the Varsity Oval. 
### 
A dangerous tendency in track
work was fortunately checked by
the recent visit of Luther Cary. A
number of the men, especially
among the distance candidates, are
so eager to get into the best con
dition possible for the 23d of
April that they have been work
ing too persistently. Cary noticed
this and warned the men, who in
consequence have lightened their
work somewhat. In general, all
the men in training are in excel
lent shape; and barring accidents
we shall have a stronger team at
the end of the season than we at
least expected at the beginning.
All the older men are doing work
satisfactory to themselves.
Among the new sprinters Cant
well, '00, Simons, '01, and Stewart,
'01, are attracting attention by
their work. Stewart is doing con
siderable distance work, very wisely
trying to build up his endurance.
Simons seems to be quick and ac
tive, but it is altogether too early
yet to judge of a sprinter's abili
ties. Cantwell is very strong and
has an excellent stride. At pres
ent he seems to be the most prom
ising of the freshman candidates
for the dashes.
A new man has appeared for the
mile, Rose, '01. For a new man
he has a remarkably good style,
and if he persists in the way he
has begun he is sure to become a
good distance runner. Hayden,
'00, is doing good work in develop
ing '' knee motion. " With his
strength and the stride which must
be the inevitable result of his pres
ent conscientious work he will
make a good man for the middle
distances. Coolidge, '98, is work
ing quietly and is progressing.
Rothrock, '98, was seen running
the distances yesterday. There
are a large number of distance
men on the track whose work is
not at present spectacular, but any
one of whom is likely to develop
into a point-winner.
Two new bicycle men are Gaches,
'00, and Cross, '00.
Boyd, '00, has again strained the
tendon which troubled him last
year and will not be out for the
jumps and vault for a couple of
weeks. A number of jumpers and
vaulters have been seen training
regularly. Dole, '01, evidently
does not intend to allow a name so
closely identified with Stanford
athletic history to become merely
historical. Moeller, Westall, and
Hinman, all freshmen, are doing
work of various degrees of excel
lence.
Besides Hopper, Simons and
Daggett have done the best
work so far in the broad jump.
One new man is trying the
weights, Dumars, '00.
Moke hurdlers ark needed.
