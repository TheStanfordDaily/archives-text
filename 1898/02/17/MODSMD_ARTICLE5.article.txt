# Library Extension.

### 
Librarian Rowell of U. C. has
just received permission from the
Board of Regents to adopt a plan
that has been in vogue in many of
the universities of the East and
also at Stanford for a considerable
period. This plan is one whereby

books of rare value, or books not
to be found in some of our libraries,
may be borrowed for a length of
time from libraries that may possess
them.
Harvard University has been
very willing to allow her books to
go out among the various univer
sity libraries. Professor Duniway
has recently received works on
colonial history from Harvard's
library for use in his classes.
