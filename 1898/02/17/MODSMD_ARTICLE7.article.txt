# Sophomore Cotillion.
## 
### 
In the article in last night's
Daily Palo Alto on the Soph
omore Cotillion mention was
omitted of the fact that there would
lie four dances after the Cotillion,
two regular and two extra, in ad
dition to the eight numbers im
mediately preceding it. This omis
sion may have caused a misunder
standing on the part of some as
regard* the length of the program
for the Cotillion.
