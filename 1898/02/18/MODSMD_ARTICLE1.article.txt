# BASEBALL ON THE CAMPUS.
## First and Only Appearance of the Alumni Team at Stanford Next Tuesday. 
### 
Among the other attractions of
Washington's Birthday the Alumni-
Varsity baseball game must not be
overlooked, as it comes after tomor
row's game between Berkeley and
the Alumni, and should furnish a
valuable index as to the standing
of our team with U. C. Whatever
else it may be, it will be a good ex
hibition of ball and the score should
be closer even than our last game
with the Alumni, as several of our
best men will have hardly recov
ered from injuries received in re
cent games. Captain Lougheed is
going about with his right hand in
splints as a result of having a
caught ball jam his fingers; Strohn
and Swindells are also troubled
with hurt hands, but all three hope
to be able to play in Tuesday's
game. The injuries of these men
were largely the causes of the post
ponement of the Sophomore-Fresh
man game, which will probably be
played some time next week.
The Alumni line-up will prob
ably be: Harrelson, If; Sheehan,
2b; Lewis, ss; Elston, c; Allen, lb;
McLaine, p; McKee, 3b; Brier, rf;
Calhoun, cf. The reappearance of
the former Stanford baseball stars
on the home diamond should be the
occasion of a warm welcome, and
"Billy" McLaine and "Jack" Shee
han will get their full share of ap
plause as in former years. An ad
mission fee of twenty-five cents
will be charged.
