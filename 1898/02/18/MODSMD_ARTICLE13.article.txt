Last year Stanford was defeated
in tennis through lack of interest.
This year there is not even enough
interest to keep the Tennis Associa
tion in existence. We are bound
by the athletic agreement to meet
(J. C. for at least two years more.
The few men who would be worthy
champions of our University com
plain that they can not get any
training because there is nobody
for them to play against. Some
thing should be done. It is not
like Stanford to be defeated in any
contest without at least trying to
prevent it.
