Thkre has been some complaint
on the part of those who loaned
the Junior Class money to start the
Annual that (he meinhers of the
class are not showing a proper
appreciation of their sacrifice. The
understanding was that the men
who advanced money did so only
temporarily in the emergency. In
doing so they merely extended the
time for the payment, of the assess
ment by the other members of the
class.
There are a great many in the
class who have not paid the levy,
and these should keep this matter
in mind and make allowance for
its payment on the first of the
month.
