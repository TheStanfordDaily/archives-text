Tlie University of Fez, in Mo
rocco, called the Keronine, was
founded in the ninth century
by a woman native of Keronan, in
Tunis, called Fatma the Holy. Not
only is this the earliest of all uni
versities in existence, hut during
the tenth and eleventh centuries it
was almost the only source of
learning, to which wandered stu
dents from all parts of the world,
Mahometan and Christian alike.
