### 
Arrangements for the Sophomore
Cotillion, which takes place next
Tuesday in Encina gymnasium,
are now almost completed, and
everything seems to indicate that
the affairs will be a success in
every respect.
Chairman Piggies of the com
mittee on arrangements returned
yesterday from San Francisco,
where he made the final arrange
ments for the music, favors, and re
freshments for the Cotillion. The
favors will be unique and wholly in
keeping with the spirit of Washing
ton's Birthday.

Every effort is to be made to dec
orate Encina gymnasium in a new
and attractive way. Evergreens
and festoons oi bunting in the na
tional colors and other devices will
relieve the bareness of the walls
and form a pretty background for
the dancers.
A reception committee has been
appointed as follows: Miss Con
neau, Messrs. Bristow Adams, (x.
P. Roberts, C. G. Murphy, and F.
B. Braden. The following have
consented to .act as patronesses:
Mesdames Jordan, French, Brown,
Van Kaathoven, Braden, and Rice.
