# MEMORIAL ASSOCIATION.
## Interesting Program to be Rendered in the Chapel Monday Evening. 
### 
Next Monchi}' evening the meet
ing of the George Washington
Memorial Association takes place
in the chapel, where an interesting
program will be given. The ob
ject of the association to build a
memorial national university at
the nation's capital was set forth
in yesterday's paper. The need of
such a university for graduate work
is shown by the number of Ameri
cans who go to European institu
tions to complete their education.
The meeting will take the form of
addresses by different people, ex
plaining the need of a great central
university, pointing out its ad
vantages, and the wonderful oppor
tunities offered by the city of Wash
ington for advanced study. No
where else in the country has the
wealth of art, science, and culture
been gathered with more care, and
the numerous Government depart
ments, libraries, galleries, and
museums make original research
more convenient and possible than
elsewhere. The program will be
on the line of such discussion, and
will be partly as follows: Open
ing music, Glee Club; The National
University, Dr. Jordan; The Scien
tific Bureaus of Washington, Dr.
Branner ; The Congressional Li
brary, Professor Duniway ; "An
dante" fron Mendelssohn's "Italian
Symphony," Symphony Club.
All are expected to add a contri
bution, large or small, to the me
morial fund which is being raised
to complete the first building.
