# Sermon by Professor Le Conte.
## 
### 
The sermon by Professor Le
Conte Sunday morning promises to
be exceedingly interesting and
should be well attended. Professor
Le Conte is a scientist of the first
order, ranking as one of the fore
most geologists of the world. He
is thoroughly evolutionary in his
ideas, and his sermon on "The True
University" will reveal something
of his character and beliefs. At
Berkeley Prof. Le Conte is the fa
vorite with the students, for he is
as much of a man as he is a scien
tist â€”and he is probably the great
est of the Le Conte brothers, whose
fame is so wide in the world of
scientific research. He delivered a
course of lectures here some time
ago. On Sunday he will be the
guest of Miss Macgillivray.
