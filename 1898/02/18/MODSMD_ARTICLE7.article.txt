Yesterday's Californian quoted
extensively from the article of the
Daily Palo Alto on the Carnot
Debate under the complimentary
heading, "A Sportsmanlike View."
In the same issue there is the fol
lowing editorial explaining some
of the rumors which had arisen re
garding the postponement of the
debate:
"The extent of the misrepresenta
tion of the university in regard to
the Carnot Debate, due, no doubt,
to an item in this paper, requires a
check before it go further. The
reason for a postponement in the
date of the debate, as published in
our news columns, was entirely er
roneous, and based upon nothing

more substantial than a reporter's
deduction that as Stanford had se
lected her representatives before
our own had been chosen, the post
ponement must be to give the lat
ter time for additional preparation.
The truth is that the California
faculty men in charge of the ar
rangements understood that the
debate would be held on the second
Friday in February and proceeded
on that assumption. Their first in
formation that it was to be held on
the lirst Friday came so late that it
would have been manifestly unfair
to have held the contest on that
date. We are glad to note the
courteous and philosophical man
ner in which Stanford has taken
her defeat, though â€¢ the city press
would have us believe that her rep
resentatives were surcharged with
eloquence which could not wait a
week."
