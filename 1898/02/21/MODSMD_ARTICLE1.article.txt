# ON THE CARNOT DEBATE.
## Interesting Letter of Comment Upon the Debaters from Charles A. Murdock. 
### 
The following letter from Charles
A. Murdock of San Francisco, who
was one of the judges in the re
cent Camot Debate, is of interest
as expressing the views of the
judges who made the award, and
it contains much that will be help
ful to Stanford debaters:
San Francisco, February 18.
Editor Daily Palo Alto.
Allow me to express my appre
ciation of the tone and tem
per of your report and ed
itorial concerning the Camot De
bate. It is not easy to be just un
der disappointment, and to accept
defeat gracefully is a tine achieve
ment. Your account of the debate
is fair, even generous, and the con
clusions expressed are eminently
just.
It is not easy to weigh the com
parative merits of a number of
contestants each of whom is strong
in some particular. In the recent
debate the native force and
straightforward earnestness of the
Stanford representatives was be
yond question, and there was a
good degree of skill. The argu
ments were strong and forcibly
made. The something wanting you
have candidly admitted. Form,
style, readiness, grace, are not the
most essential qualities in debate,
but when weight of argument is
equal, or nearly equal, considera
tions of manner turn the scale.
The late debate was creditable to
all concerned. It showed wide and
careful consideration and a good
deal of cleverness in marshaling
the arguments pro and con. There
can be little doubt that as between
sides the negative would have been
accorded first place. Dannebaum,
Morgan, and Clark were 'a strong
team. Probably the best single
speech was Dannebaum's opening.
He made the mistake of repeating
himself in his rebuttal instead of
replying to Suzzalo's really strong
preceding speech. He showed more
ability as a speaker than as a de
bater. Mr. Clark was deserving of
the applause he won. He is an ef
fective speaker and evidently a
good student.
Mr. Morgan sustained your colors
well, and need feel no shame at his
failure to win first place in a con
test where so many well equipped
contestants were straining every
nerve for victory.
Mr. Fryer's opening was not
remarkably strong. It showed
scholarship, ease, and a fine com
mand of good English. He was
discreet in reserving his best points
for his closing speech, in which he
appeared to fine advantage by rea
son of his readiness and sponta
neity. He made his points against
his opponents with a neatness that
suggested the rapier rather than the
bludgeon. He was quick to detect
a slip in which one of his antago
nists replied to what he had sup
posed the affirmative would con
tend for but which as a matter of
fact they had not. He introduced
the sole flash of humor in the
whole debate, and seemed to show
an ease that came from a general
mastery of the subject rather than

from special cramming. His final
points were clearly and cleverly
made and put forth with a confi
dent modesty that was very telling.
His advantage was two-fold. He
has inherited a beautiful speech.
The pronunciation and intonation
that our best public speakers de
spairingly seek to copy, he waß
born to. As you intimate in your
criticism there is a suggestion of
over-refinement that borders on the
effeminate in the speech of a cul
tured Englishman, but it never
crosses the line when a man is a
man.
Your Professor Fairclough iB a
good example of the truly musical
voice to which to listen is a de
light. Professor Hudson is another
good model to follow in the ameli
oration of our more vigorous but
less agreeable national tone.
Fryer is wholly natural in his
speech and is obliged to waste no
effort on account of pronunciation.
That he is scholarly and has won
a diction that is almost faultless is
very evident. In the second place
he has not relied on natural gifts
but has gained his ease and readi
ness by training. lam told that he
has twice before contested for this
medal, which shows perseverance
and pluck.
One always enjoys the confirma
tion of one's judgment, and it was
a satisfaction to hear that M.
Lalande, who had listened very at
tentively to the debate, remarked
before the award had been made
that Mr. Fryer was his first choice
on the affirmative and Mr. Clark
on the negative.
After all, the medal is the least
important factor in the case. That
such a good debate is provoked by
it fully justifies it. It is compara
tively easy to judge of results and
to award a medal, but who best, de
serves it no one can tell. Absolute
justice would recognize effort
rather than achievement, and what
has been overcome rather than what
has been attained. The best feat
ure of it all is the good feeling that
was manifested on the evening and
that your editorial expresses. The
more of such friendly contests be
tween our two great universities the
better, that they may cultivate and
express the good will that ought
always to exist between them.
Very truly yours,
Chas. A. Murdock.
