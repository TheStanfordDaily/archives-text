in writing this letter Mr. Murdock j
has established a precedent for
future judges, as it is only through
frank and honest criticism from
practical public men, from whom
the judges are usually chosen, that;
the defects of our debaters which
count most against us in inter-1
collegiate contests may be pointed
out and guarded against. It is dif
