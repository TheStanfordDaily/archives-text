# Berkeley-Alumni Game.
## 
### 
The Alumni baseball men re
ceived their second defeat at the
game in Central Park Saturday, in
which they crossed bats with the
Berkeley Varsity. The game was
an extremely long one, and as the
Alumni team was handicapped by
the loss of McLaine, who was able
to pitch for only a few innings, the
game proved a very one-sided af
fair, the score being 19 to 4.
