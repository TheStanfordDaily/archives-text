# VARSITY VS. ALUMNI.
## Old and New Players Will Contest on Our Diamond Tomorrow Afternoon. 
### 
The first game between the
Alumni and Varsity on the cam
pus will be played on the diamond
here tomorrow afternoon at 2:30.
Although the Alumni team was
beaten by Berkeley last Saturday,
this was largely due to the fact that
McLaine pitched only through part
of the game. Consequently, the
contest tomorrow will probably be
more exciting.
The game deserves a large atten
dance from the fact that there will
be given an opportunity to see our
old players in action.
The teams for the game are as
follows:
STANFORD. ALUMNI.
Lougheed ss Lewis
Strohn 3b McKee
Wight cf Calhoun
Young lb Allen
Swindells c Elston
Harris 2b Sheehan
Lawrence rf 1. ..Brier
Hill p McLaine
Klauber If Harrelson
