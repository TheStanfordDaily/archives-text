# COTILLION SUCCESSFUL.
## Second Hop of the Sophomore Class a Brilliant Social Affair. 
### 
Last night's Cotillion more than
fulfilled expectations. Itcan safely
be said to be one of the most suc
cessful affairs of its kind ever given
at Stanford. The attendance was
unusually large and the manage
ment was well pleased. Good mu
sic, a smooth floor, and a well filled
gym. brought smiles of approval
from the dancers.
After eight regular dances and
two extras the cotillion took place.
Hut three figures were danced, as
the time had been encroached on
by the encores of the preceding
numbers. Four sets had to be ar
ranged to accommodate the eighty
couples in attendance. The figures
were simple, but very pretty, and
might be called the flag, the re
volving circle, and the marching
figures. The favors were very ap
propriate, tlags and hatchets being
especially so for a 22d of February
cotillion.
The german was led by Class
President Burnett with Miss G'on
neau. There were no hitches and
everything was remarkably well
managed.
The gym. looked as well as it
could be made. The decorations
were evergreens relieved by stream
ers of red ,white,and blue. Refresh
ments were served in the gallery
during the evening.
Among the visitors in attendance
were Misses Reed Hutchins, Etta
Edwards, Marie Messer, Bessie
lie Dell, Hosnier, Shane, and Pearl
Sabin of San Francisco, Miss Nell
North of San Jose, and the Misses
Clupps and Gibson of Radcliffe
Hall; Messrs. Preston and Ruscoe,
U. S. N., and Budd and Foster of
Berkeley.
