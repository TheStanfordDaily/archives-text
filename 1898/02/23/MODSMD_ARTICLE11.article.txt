### 
The following additions have re
cently been made to the Zoological
department: A small collection of
fresh water tish from the Eastern
States, presented by Professor S. E.
Meek of the Field-Columbian mu
seum of Chicago; three valuable
specimens of fish from the Colorado
river, given by F. Stephens of San
Diego; a small collection of bird
skins from Humboldt county, given
by Mr. Fiebig of Eureka; and a
very rare specimen of a black mole,
presented by N. B. Scolield, 'i) 5.
The most valuable acquisition is
a line specimen of the California
condor (Paeudoyryphm califom
ianus), presented by Mr. Holton
Webb of Lompoc, Cal. This bird
rivals the great South American
condor in size. Its habits are sim
ilar to those of the well known tur
key buzzard. Formerly it was
common on the Pacific Coast, but
it is now one of the rarest species
in the United States.
