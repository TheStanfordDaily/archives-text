# Peary's Lecture Friday.
## 
### 
Lieutenant Robert E. Peary, the
famous Arctic explorer, will lecture
in the chapel Friday evening for
the benefit of the '99 Annual fund.
The '99 Class is now in debt $100
to individual members of the class,
and the lecture on Arctic explora
tion was secured to assist in raising
this debt.
Lieutenant Peary is one of the
well known men of the day. His
achievements in the North have
given him a place among the fore
most of Arctic explorers. Peary
has demonstrated that there is in
Greenland an unchanging icecap,
and he has also determined the
northern boundary of Greenland.
Peary is a man of an attractive per
sonality, being a man of force and
character, and also a very enter
taining speaker. He is a man with
a story and he knows how to tell it.
One of the most valuable results
of Peary's Northern expeditions
were the photographs he took, and
it is certain that the pictorial re
sults of no previous Arctic trip com
pare with those he has achieved.
Scientific men who have seen his
ethnological pictures say that no
earlier explorer obtained so fine a
series of any native tribe in any
part of the world. Altogether he
took 2,300 negatives.
Peary has made eight expeditions
to Northern Greenland, and on one
of his trips he travelled 1,<'500 miles

on foot on an icy plateau 5,000 to
8 000 feet above the sea level. On
his return from his last trip he
brought back with him a gigantic
meteorite.
Tickets will be on sale tomorrow
and Friday at the postoffice from
2to 5 p.m. Reserved seats are
seventy-five cents, general admis
sion fifty cents.
