We can not hope in the space
at our disposal to give any ad
equate summary of what the ven
erable educator, Professor LeConte
of the University of California,
said in our chapel Sunday. The
following are extracts:
"The idea of the true university
that 1 shall present to you is what
we all desire our two California
universities to become. We can
not achieve it at once, but let us
conceive it, work for it, get it.
"The real university has two
functions, to lift life to a higher level
and to prepare for an efficient life
of activity. There are three char
acteristic and co-ordinate parts in a
university training—the science
course, the arts course, and the
philosophy course.
"The science course, starting
with the study of mathematics,
leads up through mechanics, phys
ics, chemistry, biology, and geol
ogy to the most important of
sciences, sociology. The arts
course, having to do with training
in the modes employing thought
and feeling, includes language, let
ters, fine arts, history, and through
philosophical history to sociology
again. The philosophy course
proceeds from logic through philos
ophy, mental and moral, and
again from still another side ap
proaches the all-important subject,
sociology. Each has its character
istic and its correlative function:
each is perfect in itself, but all
more perfect in their union.
"'Phe spirit of science is truth for
its own sake. It is the worship of
truth as the image of God in hu
man reason. Its food is coarse —too
coarse for some; its method of
gathering morsel b}' morsel is
slow —too slow for some. But it is
good food, substantial and nourish
ing. Philosophy alone gives ra
tional grounds of the validity of
all knowledge. Its methods are
less certain, its truths less veri
fiable, its food less substantial —
food for the gods perhaps, but we,
too, are the sons of God. Lan
guage is the sensible embodiment
of our inner state. This depart
ment cultivates the power of incar
nating the human spirit. The co
ordinate value of this department
is great. Language is as charac
teristic of man as his reason.
Language is the necessary inter
mediate stej) between thought and
action, the conception and the ex
ecution. Strong thinking clothes
itself in strong words, and likewise
the effort to attain clear, logical
language reacts and leads to clear
logical thought.
"The distinctive purpose of auni
versity is not culture —that belongs
to the college —but preparation for
active life. Of the tree of educa
tion, its roots are the schools, its
trunk the college, and the fruit
