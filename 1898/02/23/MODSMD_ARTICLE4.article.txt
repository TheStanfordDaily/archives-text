# VARSITY MET DEFEAT.
## The 						Consolidated Alumni Nine Won Yesterday by a Large Score. 
### 
The first schedule game on the
campus resulted in the defeat of
the Varsity by the Alumni. The
score was 11 to 3. Stanford was
defeated on account of inexcusable
errors in fielding and poor batting.
The base running was also not up
to the standard. The Alumni
team proved itself to be as hard a
hitting team as Stanford is likely
to meet this season.
