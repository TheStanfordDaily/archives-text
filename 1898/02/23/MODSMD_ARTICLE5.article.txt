# For a National University.

### 
Washington's Birthday was cele
brated on Monday evening by a
well-attended meeting under the
auspices of the Washington
Memorial Association. The pro
gram opened with a violin solo by
Fred L. Dully, Mrs. Starbuck ac
companying.
Dr. Jordan, who presided, spoke
upon "A National University."
"The Father of His Country," he
said, looked forward to the estab
lishment of a National University
as a matter of course, and set aside
$25,000 in his will for that pur
pose. The apathy of the people
and the hostility of certain sectar
ian institutions have prevented the
carrying out of the plan. Lately,
a committee of one hundred well

known men, aided by public
spirited women, has taken the mat
ter in hand. In 18i)6 Dr. Jordan,
as spokesman for this committee,
made an argument before the com
mittee of the United States Senate
in favor of a National University.
He closed by reading extracts from
this argument, in part as follows:
"It is the need of the nation, and
not of the nation alone, but of the
world. A great university in
America would be a school for the
study of civic freedom. It would
draw men of all lands to the study
of democracy. In conclusion, a
university is simply a contrivance
for making wisdom effective by
surrounding wise men with the
conditions most favorable for ren
dering wisdom contagious. There
is no instrument of political, social,
cr administrative reform to be com
pared with the influence of a Na
tional U ni versity."
Dr. Branner next spoke on "The
Scientific Bureaus of Washington,"
which furnish the different depart
ments of the Government with ex
pert knowledge on scientific sub
jects. Each department has in its
employ specialists.who devote their
lives to working out problems of
value to the Government, scientific
workers, and practical men. To a
young student, contact with such
men would afford the greatest pos
sible incentive to original investi
gation, of which our present uni
versities do not give enough. A
National University would bring
together the results of the research
now going on under Governmental
direction.
Concerning "The Congressional
Library," Professor Duniway said:
"It has been said that a university
is a great library with people to
work in it. This is true in a meas
ure. Each man today must stand
on the shoulders of those who have
gone before." He then sketched
the growth of the library of Con
gress from the destructive fire of
1855 on to 1870, since which time
the collection has grown, first,
through the expenditure annually
of $11,000 on periodicals mainly,
and, second, by the copyright reg
ulation requiring the deposit of two
copies of every book. Such a
library has its good and bad
points. Size is in its favor, con
taining as it does 450,000 volumes,
not counting duplicates or periodi
cals. It is fairly complete along
certain lines, but lamentably one
sided, being too largely American
and lacking organization. Still,
supplemented as it is by the-spe
cial libraries of the Senate, the
House,and the various Government
bureaus, it puts Washington in the
lead in library facilities, unless we
except Boston.
Miss Miller read that part of
Washington's will pertaining to a
university, and after a collection
had been taken to aid the project
the program closed with a selection
from Mendelssohn by the Sym
phony Orchestra.
