# Delta Upsilon Musicale.
## 
### 
Delta Upsilon gave a most en
joyable musicale last Saturday
evening to a few of their friends.
Mr. Savannah, the gifted violinist,
and Miss Griffin, the well known
pianist of San Francisco, were the
musicians of the evening.
The decorations of violets and
carnations were most effectively ar
ranged about the beautiful rooms.
One particularly pleasing feature
of the entertainment was the per
fect ease with which the performers
could be observed by all the guests,
owing to the manner in which the
rooms may be thrown open together.
Among the guests were Dr. and
Mrs. Jordan and Miss Jordan, and
prominent members of the faculty.
At 8:30 the first selection, the
Fifth Sonata by Beethoven, was
begun. The program rendered was
as follows:
Sonata A. von Beethoven
Two Movements from a "Suite''.
Franz liiex
Sonata, C minor Grieg
Legende Wieniawski
Spanish Dances Pablo Sarasate
Miss Griffin and
Mr. S. Savannah
Raphsodie
Tarantella
Miss Griffin
The audience was a musical one
and enjoyed the difficult program
thoroughly. Of the selections ren
dered by Mr. Savannah and Miss
Griffin in concert, the Legende of
Wieniawski was especially effective.
Miss Griffin's rendering of the se
lection from Tarantella formed a
fitting conclusion to a most de
lightful evening.
