# Cupola for Foundry Work.
## 
### 
There has been in the possession
of the University for some time a
cupola for melting iron. Up to a
few days ago it had been lying idle
in one of the brick Engineering
buildings, but now it is being set up
for use in general foundry work
under the Mechanical Engineering
department.
l'rofessor G. JI. Marx, who has
the work of setting the cupola up,
says:"It is as good a one as there
is made, and although rather large
for our purpose, it can be double
bricked to make the inside dimen
sions smaller. It has long been
planned to get it into running or
der, and to convert the large room
where it now is into a regular
foundry, where we can make iron
castings and give a good course in
foundry work, as is scheduled.
Jleret >fore our accommodations for
this work have been very meager,
and brass castings were about all
we could make. Mr. Ay res, stu
dent assistant in charge of pattern
making, is doing a large part of the
work, and the whole thing is being
pushed forward, all the work, man
ual and otherwise, being done by
our own efforts.'"
When the cupola is in place a
regular course in foundry work will
follow, and it is planned to make
another smaller one here at the
University.
