# THE
						PEARY LECTURE.
## The
						Noted Arctic Explorer Will Appear for the Benefit of the '99 Annual. 
### 
Lieutenant It. E. Peary, U. 8. N.,
will deliver his famous lecture on
Arctic exploration tomorrow even
ing in the University chapel. The
lecture will be given under the aus
pices of the '99 Class, and the pro
ceeds will be devoted to the '99 An
nual fund.
Lieutenant Peary is a man of re
markable force of character. For
five years he has devoted himself
and his energy to the one single
object of advancing the cause of
Arctic exploration.
In person he is tall and striking
and has a decidedly military bear
ing. He is well-built and has the
endurance needed to undergo the
hardships of Northern life.
Even now Lieutenant Peary is
planning his next trip. He said
in a recent interview: "I expect to
sail out of New York between the
middle and the last of July. The
vessel 1 shall use for the expedition
is the Windward, a steam whaler
of 260 tons, that was given to me
for the purpose by an English
gentleman last December. 1 shall
take provisions sufficient fora live
years' trip. Thus 1 will be pre
pared to remain live years in the
I North. I may accomplish my ob
ject in two years. I hope to accom
plish it in three years."
In Greenland Mr. Peary will es
tablish a base of supplies at the
most northerly point, and from
that place, accompanied by a few
picked natives, will make a dash
for the pole, expecting to cover the
intervening 350 miles in fifty days.
In the lecture tomorrow evening
Mr. Peary will discuss in his in
imitable way his future plans as
well as describe his past exploits
and the present trend of Arctic ex
ploration. The lecture will be il
lustrated by stereopticon views, and
the Arctic scenes which will be
shown are said to be marvelously
beautiful. The lecture will be in
j teresting both from a popular and
a scientific standpoint.
| The Call of February 16 had the
j following comment: "Lieutenant
R. E. Peary, U. S. N., the Arctic
explorer, delivered a most interest
ing lecture last night, and those
| who were present listened to a vivid
description of the hardships exper
j ienced by the hardy explorer in
. penetrating the region of ice which
| is supposed to lead to the hitherto
I undiscovered North Pole. What
| made the lecture doubly interesting
j was a series of stereopticon views
[collected by the Lieutenant during
his travels in the land designated
by him as the Arctic Sahara, and
i the pictures were received with the
| liveliest expressions of satisfaction
j and demonstrations of applause by
I the audience which gathered to
hear him."
The Report says of Peary's lecture:
"The speaker's pleasant informal
style, his enthusiasm, his modesty,
all pleased an audience that for
nearly two hours sat listening with
close attention to the descriptions
of the perils, dangers, privations,
and accomplishments of the several
trips he has made to the frozen
lands. The lantern views which

early in the lecture were brought
into play are among the finest that
ever have been shown here, and
possess a special and unusual in
terest in that Lieutenant Peary and
his friend and aid, Lee, took them
from all sorts of places and under
all sorts of daring and trying con
ditions. When men on the verge
of starvation and death think of
using the camera so that science
and future explorations may be
benefited, it is evident that mind
dominates matter to the last minute,
and that enthusiasm is not dashed
out by cold blasts and a last bis
cuit."
The following is from the Oak
land correspondence of the Exam
iner for February 14: "Lieutenant
Peary's lecture here tonight was a
most interesting discourse on Ar -
tic travel. The narrative was not
less entertaining than the exquisite
views of Arctic scenery, beautifully
colored, that we're displayed. Many
of them depicted in all the mag
nificence of icy brilliancy the won
derful bergs and other formations
of the Arctic region. The lecturer
vividly portrayed the perils of his
last journey across Northern Green
land. During the evening there
were displayed scores of views
made from photographs of the jour
ney across the great ice cap of the
most northern point of Greenland.
The perils, hardships, and suffering
were described, yet so modestly
that the chief figure in this search
fora route to the pole was not
more in view than his comrades,
Hansen and Lee, the Eskimos, and
their dogs."
