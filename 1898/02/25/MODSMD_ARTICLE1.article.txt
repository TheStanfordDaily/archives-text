# ATHLETIC NEGLIGENCE.
## A.B. Rice, '95, Points Out a Striking Case in Connection with the Alumni Team. 
### 
San Francisco, Feb. 25, 1898.
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Sir: I wish to call the attention of
the Stanford student body to the
fact that one of the members of the
present so-called Alumni baseball
team is a. professional, and that
his playing as an amateur is being
tacitly and freely permitted by
persons in authority, whose duty it
is to uphold the strictest amateur
ism and, above all, to protect the
standing of the active Varsity
players.
I wrote to you privately concern
ing this matter when the names of
the Alumni nine were first pub
lished, and when action taken then
could easily and quietly have pre
vented what has since become a
most inexcusable and overt viola
tion by Stanford of amateur law.
Executive officers have no right
to be swayed by considerations for
the good fellowship or the personal
popularity of any transgressor of
laws that are so explicit that they
permit of but one plain interpre
tation. An athlete is either an
amateur or he is a professional
There can be no middle ground.
Once having gone into profession
alism, neither his own expressed
regrets or the excuses of his friends
can restore him to amateurism.
Here briefly and in substance
are the facts of the case: In 1893,
in 1894, in 1895, and in 1896,
when lie was also Varsity captain,
McLaine, ex-'9(S, was a member of
the Stanford baseball team. Im
mediately upon the expiration of
those four years of service he was,
according to the existing intercol
legiate agreement, no longer eligi
ble to represent Stanford in any
athletic contest with the University
of California. Practically debarred
by this rule from college athletics,
lie joined, last season, the Reliance
baseball team, and with it re
peatedly played in what was
known as the Examiner tour
nament, an avowed contest for and
among professionals. He not only
played with professionals and
against professionals, who were reg
ularly receiving money for their
services, but in Sunday games, for
respectability's sake, he played un
der the assumed name of Milwain.
For each of these reasons and for
others he absolutely forfeited his
standing as an amateur athlete.
He knew it, and many of the Stan
ford, the California, and the
Alumni players knew it.
On Saturday, February 12, oc
curred the first Stanford-Alumni
game. It was the initial match of
the present collegiate series. It
was a regular contest advertised as
such, and admission was charged.
I arrived at Central Park that after
noon in time to see only the last
half of the ninth inning. I re
marked with surprise that McLaine
was playing with the Alumni and
against the Stanford amateurs. A
prominent member of the student
body replying in a noticeably sub
dued tone, said, in effect, "Oh, that's
been fixed all right; his name has
been protested."
Last Saturday again McLaine

played with the Alumni team, al
though, during the week, I was
told that he would not be further
called upon. At the same time I
was informed that California's
manager was eager to have some
non-college man from San Rafael
pitch for the Alumni.
It is the duty of the student body
to investigate this matter with a
view to placing the responsibilty
unsparingly where it belongs. I
say this sis an alumnus who feels
as deep an interest in Stanford's
athletic welfare as any undergrad
uate can. I say it also without
prejudice, for, to begin with, Mc-
Laine and I are members of the
same college fraternity, and are
now and have long been close per
sonal friends.
Personal considerations have no
thing to do with the case. It is
simply a question of whether or
not the student body will know
ingly tolerate this sort of thing.
The name Stanford should al
ways be a guarantee of truest ama
teur sport. Archie Rice, '95.
