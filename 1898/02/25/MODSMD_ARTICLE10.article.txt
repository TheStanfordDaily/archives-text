The Chronicle today states thai
the question (submitted by Stan
ford for the Intercollegiate Debate
with Berkeley "has caused a great
deal of comment in the short time
since it was announced, and the
undergraduates of Berkeley who
have read it regard it as rather a
strategic move on the part of Stan
ford." The question is as simple as
it could be made, and there is not
a vague part to it. Such expres
sions as ''unrestricted production,"
"open market," can not be construed
in any but one way, and if there is
stratagem on Stanford's part it
does not show in the question sub
mitted, which is clear and to the
point.
