"It is worth noticing tli.it, while
we luive won three Carnot Debates
to Stanford's one, the two univer
sities have each won two lntercol
legiates." —Occident editorial, Feb
ruary 18.
That the editor of the Occident,
in his ambitious efforts to establish
the point that by winning the
Carnot Debate this year the Uni
versity of California has estab
lished beyond a question its su
premacy in the debating field, has
not been true to history is shown
by the following record of the win
ners of the Intercollegiate debates,
which can be verified in a dozen
places:
1898 —Stanford.
181)4 —Stanford,
1895 —University of California.
1896 —University of California.
1897 —Stanford.
Probably what the editor had in
mind was the fact that in 1894 the
San Francisco Examiner offered a
cup to the university first winning
three debates. Since 1894 each uni
versity has won two Intercollegi
ate debates.
