# Chess Tournament.

### 
The Intercollegiate Chess Tour
nament will be held in the parlors
of the Mark Hopkins Institute of
Art in San Francisco, Saturday,
March 5. The Stanford team has
been chosen, and will consist of
Serpas, Arnold, Knecht, Van
Kaathoven, and Veuve of the
Junior Class, and Wright of the
Freshman Class. Although a vic
tory is not altogether conceded to
California, all indications point
that way, as Serpas, the only player
left from last year's team and the
best player in the University now.
did not win his game with Epstein,
who is on the U. C. team this year.
Still, the Stanford team has shown
great improvement lately, Serpas
with the rest, and with the de
termination to win which the team
possesses and with some favorable
elements of chance that may en
ter into the drawing of opponents,
the cardinal's chances are not so
dubious as they seemed earlier in
the season. It would greatly en
courage our players if there could
be a Stanford "backing" present
among the visitors to the tourna
ment, and all who can should see
the contest.
