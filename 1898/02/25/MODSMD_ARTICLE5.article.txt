# AGREEMENT DISCUSSED.
## The 						Athletic Committee Considered What Amendments Should Be Proposed. 
### 
An important meeting of the
Athletic Committee was held this
afternoon to consider any desirable
changes in the present intercolleg
iate athletic agreement.
Doctor Angell discussed the ad
visability of giving more perpetuity
to the sub-athletic committee by
appointing its members for three
years, two and one respectively,
and then electing a new member
each year for a term of three years.
He thought it would also be ad
visable to make the chairman of
the Faculty Athletic Committee a
member of such committee provid
ing it was deemed best to have a
member of the faculty oil the com
mittee.
Track Manager Gregory said it
was probable that this year's field
day would be held on the Oakland
track, and if such was the case, he
advocated holding the bicycle races
on the same track. The manager
of Berkeley's track team was favor
able to the proposition and negotia
tions are being made with the
proper authorities to that effect.
If the field-day is to be held on the
Olympic track, Manager Gregory
desires the bicycle races to be held
in San Jose. In regard to points
for the year's field-day, the com
mittee was advised to advocate 5,
2, 1, the same schedule as has been
in force for several years.
The committee was also em
powered to work for the passage
of an intercollegiate agreement
whereby any change in the inter
collegiate agreement which either
university might contemplate
should he submitted to the other
university at least two before
the meeting of the joint committee
