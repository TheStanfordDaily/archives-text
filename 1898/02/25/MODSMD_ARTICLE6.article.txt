# How the News Is "Heeled" at Yale.
## 
### 
The following is from the New
Haven correspondence of the New
York Sun of February 13, regard
ing the organization and methods
of the Yale Daily News: "Training
for the Yale Daily News is as much
a feature, of Yale life as training
for the football eleven. It is
harder work, if constant applica
tion be counted, and in Yale life it
brings honor. 'The pen is mightier
than the pig-skin or the oar,' is a
Yale maxim that is proved by the
list of men chosen to membership
in the secret societies.
"A freshman coming to Yale has
four chances to gain at) editorship
on the Yale News. He may start
when he enters college, work six
months with his classmates, be de
feated in the race, try for another
six months', again be outclassed,
and keep it up until the fourth
period of six months is over. This
brings him through his sophomore
year. If he has not won a place
by that time he never will, for
juniors and seniors are not allowed
to compete.
"Last fall the competition began
with about thirty freshmen among
the list of News "heelers." They
were prominent about the campus
for a few weeks, but the faint
hearted dropped out of the ranks
until there are only seven who
have kept up the fight.

"The competition has rules of its
own. Every 'heeler' must have
his article signed by his source of
authority. Thus, if one of the
workers obtains a thousand-word
interview with President Dwighton
the prospects of a race with Cornell,
he must have President Dwight's
signature on the first sheet of the
interview to secure credit for his en
terprise. Another rule is that all
competitors must work alone.
"Once in a while a candidate is
fcund whose religious scruples will
not allow him to work 011 Sunday.
The Yale News does not get out a
Sunday edition, but it is published
on Monday, and the "heelers" are
kept busy on Sunday hunting for
news. Several have refused to
work on Sunday 011 moral grounds,
but the competition is so fierce that
in the history of the News only one
candidate has ever gained an elec
tion who omitted Sunday work.
The system of competition compels
every candidate to cover all Yale.
He has to be his own city editor,
force of reporters, and proof-reader.
Every misspelled word or wrong
initial detracts a certain number
from his credits. Every article is
credited to the author, and a cer
tain number of credits given for it
according to its length and its im
portance.
"The 'heeler's' work is done by 8
o'clock at night. All his copy
must be shoved through the door
into the News office by that time.
The senior editors make up the pa
per between then and 10 o'clock,
and it is published about 1 o'clock
the next afternoon. This is the
least up-to-date feature of Yale
news-gathering. The 'heelers' are
spry in getting their news into the
office, but the editors allow twenty
seven hours to elapse before the
news is printed. The Yale News
was beaten 011 Yale's reply to Cor
nell's proposition for a boat race,
probably one of the most important
pieces of college news published
this year. The reply was given out
at 11 o'clock one evening. The Yale
News editors had the paper made
up, the 'heelers' had gone home,
and, although all the daily papers
had the text of Yale's answer the
next morning, the Yale News, which
came out at 1 o'clock in the after
noon, had not a line of it.
"The senior editors of the News
divide the profits at the end of their
year. They generally receive about
$400 apiece. The business man
ager gets a double portion, or about
$800."
