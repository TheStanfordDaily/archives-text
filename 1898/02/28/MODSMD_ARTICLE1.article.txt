# NO "ATHLETIC NEGLIGENCE."
## Manager Keesling Shows That the Team's Amateur Status Has Been Protected. 
### 
Feb. 28, 1898.
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
There appeared in the columns
of the Daily Palo Alto Friday
evening an article on "Athletic
negligence" written and signed by
"Archie Rice,'9s." This criticism
was advanced by one who, un
doubtedly, takes the greatest in
terest in amateur athletics in our
University. As it attacked
baseball in particular and
directed its attack on the manage
ment, which has been delegated to
me this season —in order to protect
the University from the apparent
shadow it has cast over athletics, I
will answer this gentleman who
poses as a purifier and show the
fallacy of his arguments.
In substance, his attack is as
follows: The Alumni team played
McLaine as pitcher; McLaine is a
professional; that makes the whole
Alumni team professionals; Stan
ford played the Alumni, who are
professionals, for a gate, and this
places the Stanford team in jeo
pardy of being professionals.
That is certainly a prima facie
case, and the Stanford team would
certainly have been led into a bad
hole were these the only facts in
connection with the case.
That the Alumni team were go
ing to play McLaine, and that his
playing raised a serious question,
was well known to all interested in
baseball in these parts. In order
to protect the team, 1 appeared per
sonally before Mr. Humphrey,
chairman of the registration com
mittee, which committee has full
power to grant all sanctions of the
Pacific Athletic Association, and
applied for a sanction for the game.
Mr. Humphrey granted it, without
hesitation, and then in reference to
McLaine said that it would only be
necessary to protest him before the
game in order to protect ourselves.
Mcl jaine was protested before the
name by Captain Lougheed and
myself. Consequently in the eyes
of the P. A. A. we are safe enough,
but Mr. Rice thinks not. Whether
this will make the Alumni players
professionals or not is another ques
tion and not of interest in this case,
owing to the sanction.
Mr. Rice deplores the fact that
Stanford should play professionals.
If he would carefully glance at the
lists of players of the teams com
posed of such men we can safely
bring collegians in contact with, he
would see the impossibility of get
ting practice games (for they are
really practice games leading to a
series with the University of Cali
fornia) with teams not containing
some men of questionable athletic
standing.
As we can not get games with
purely amateur teams who are
capable of giving us practice
worthy of notice, and as practice
with strong teams is by far the
best for a team, we must
play the teams available as long as
we are sanctioned by the P. A. A.
In view of the difficulty of se
curing games with purely amateur
teams, Mr. Cross, manager of the

U. C. team, and myself came to the
conclusion that there was nothing
else to be done but to play these
teams under the sanction of the
P. A. A. As long as both Uni
versity teams remain purely am
ateur there is no trouble to antici
pate.
The article was entirely uncalled
for. It has created a false im
pression, which is only disagree
able. If Mr. Rice had only asked
for information from the proper
authorities he would have received
it, and his letter would not have
appeared. He knew who the proper
authorities were, and, altliou ;h of
ten in contact with them, asked for
no information, but directed his at
tention to the editor of the Daily
Palo Alto, whom he knew was not
the baseball manager nor the base
ball captain. Had he made his
suggestion to the proper authori
ties the matter would have been
properly ended with less publicity.
