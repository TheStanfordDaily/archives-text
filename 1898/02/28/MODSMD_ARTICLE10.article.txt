Thk letter published in the Daily
Palo Ai/ro Friday from Mr. A. B.
Rice, ' ( J5, was received too late for
editorial comment. In an answer
in another column Mr. Keesling
presents the other side of the case.
The burden which Mr. Bite
throws on the editor of the Daily
Palo Alto from the fact that lie
privately wrote a letter to the ed
itor at a time "when the mimes of
the Alumni nine were first pub
lished, and when action taken then
could easily and quietly have pre
vented what has since become a
most inexcusable and overt viola
tion by Stanford of amateur law,"
is accepted cheerfully. All the
necessary action was taken by the
editor of the Daily Palo Alto
when he referred the fact that
McLaine's amateur standing was
being questioned to Baseball Man
ager Keesling and to Mr. Dole, who
represents Stanford in the P. A. A.,
with the advice that no action bt>
taken which would place in jeo
pardy the amateur status of the
team. Mr. Bice's letter was private
and his name was not mentioned
in the case.
No one cnn question the patri
otic motives which urged the writ
ing of the letter above referred to.
Some question may exist as to
whether Mr. Rice made a careful
investigation of the subject. As
far as we can see, the manager of
the nine has taken due care to pre
serve the amateur status of the
team. No one doubts the truth of
Mr. Rice's statement that McLaine
is outside the amateur ranks, but
it is also evident that Mr. Keesling
acted according to the advice of
the officials of the P. A. A., and that
the game was sanctioned.
The demoralized state into which
amateur baseball has been cast on
the Coast by the recent professional
tournaments has rendered it diffi
cult for two college nines to obtain
practice with strictly amateur

teams. When this fact is taken
into consideration, and also the
fact that the proper precautions
were taken by the management,
Mr Uice's letter seems somewhat
uncalled for.
However, some oflicial action
should be taken in the matter, as
such unqualified charges deserve
an official investigation and a pub
lic answer. This the Athletic Com
mittee should do at once.
