# Peary's Lecture.
## 
### 
The chapel was well filled Fri
day evening for the Peary lecture,
and those who attended were re
warded by a very delightful even
ing. Lieutenant Peary has a com
manding personality and a clear
and powerful voice. He has an
excellent command of English, por
traying in vivid terms the difficult
ies and dangers of Arctic explora
tion.
After a brief preface describing
recent attempts to reach the pole,
the lecturer outlined his own plans.
He intends to establish an Eskimo
colony at the most northerly point
of Greenland, and make an attempt
to cover the remaining distance of
perhaps 350 miles, accompanied by
only two or three companions.
Life in the Arctic regions, the trip
on the Arctic Sahara of Greenland,
the Peary meteorites —all were de
scribed in a realistic manner. The
stereopticon views brought before
the eyes of the audience Arctic life
and scenery as it exists. Interest
never flagged throughout the even
ing. The lecturer and the views
were frequently applauded.
The '99 Annual netted about $50
as its share of the proceeds.
