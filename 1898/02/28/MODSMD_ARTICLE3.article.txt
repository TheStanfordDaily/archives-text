# Final Class Game.
## 
### 
Tomorrow at 3:30 the two under
classes will meet on the diamond
to decide the University baseball
championship for this year. Each
class rather easily won its prelimi

be hoped for tomorrow than was
shown then. The traditional an
tipathy of the classes will doubt
less result in a stubbornly fought
contest. The management will
probably charge an admission fee
of ten cents.
