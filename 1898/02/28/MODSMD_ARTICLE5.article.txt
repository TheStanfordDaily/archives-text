# NINETEEN TO ELEVEN.
## Varsity Men Win From the Alumni in a Game Full of Errors and Poor Fielding. 
### 
The Washington Birthday de
feat was retrieved Saturday by the
Varsity, although the game played
was not a very high class exhibi
tion of baseball. The final score
was Stanford 19, Alumni 11.
The number of hits and errors
made was within two as many as
the number of spectators, exclu
sive of reporters and small boys.
Stanford struck a batting gait from
the start, but unforunately played
a poor fielding game. The work of
Young was the only redeeming
feature of the day, as his score
shows. His hits were numerous
and well timed, while his errors
were largely excusable. Edwards
played a poor game at third.
Lanagan pitched six innings, in
which he struck .out five men,
allowing live hits and giving six
bases on balls. Beckett in three
innings struck out three men
and allowed only one base on
balls, no hits being made off his
delivery. Strohn caught well, al
though his hand has not recovered.
Captain Lougheed was handicapped
by a similar injury.
The batting was ahead of any
previous game, five of the hits be
ing more than singles. The base
running showed a marked improve
ment. The Alumni played their
usual loose game, batting and
fielding poorly. The features from
their point of view were two bril
liant double plays, Holladay to Ire
land to Allen.
Umpire Bill Lange seemed sur
prised at Stanford's reversal of
form since the first game at Central
Park, and commented on the lack
of ginger in the Varsity's play. He
was pleased with the batting and
base running, but thought the team
should play a better fielding game.
The score follows:
