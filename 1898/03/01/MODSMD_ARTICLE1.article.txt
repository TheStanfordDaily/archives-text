# ENCINA MEN MEET.
## Encina Club-Room Opened, and a Board of Trustees Elected to Assume Control. 
### 
The old dining-room of Encina
Hall has been transformed into a
social ball with an Encina club
government. Mrs. Stanford has
fitted the new hall with billiard
and pool tableß and six small
tables, on which will be placed all
of the current reading matter of
the day. The intention is to make
the place a large parlor and reading
room where the hall men can gather
and cultivate the social side of life.
The men of Encina gathered in
the new club-room last night for
the first time. Every man in the
great dormitory attended, and the
greatest enthusiasm was voiced in
cheers for Mrs. Stanford sind in the
yell. W. A. Prichard, '1)8, presided.
The object of the meeting last night
was to formulate the first essentials
of si plan of government. A com
mittee consisting of W. A. Prichard,
'98, John M. Switzer, '98, Hugo
Klauber, '00, previously appointed
at an informal meeting of the En
cina men, reported a set of resolu
tions outlining a scheme of govern
ment. Two trustees were to be
elected from each of the three upper
classes and one from the Freshman
Chins. The board of trustees was
to be the executive body of the club,
with power to elect their own offi
cers, appoint sub-committees, and
provide for all the details of the
organization, and also to draw up
rules and take means to place the
club in successful operation. The
officers hold office for one semester
Following the report of the com
mittee given by Mr Switzer, W. H.
Irwin, '98, vvsis called upon and
spoke upon the influence the room
would have upon the University
spirit, and suggested the plan of
instituting si custom so that upon
graduation an Encina man would
leave some memorial behind him
in the shape of a gift to the room.
Fickert was called upon and yielded
the floor to Professor Duniway,
who spoke of his personal experi
ence in dormitory life and made
several valuable suggestions as to
the way in which the room should
be used and regarded, especially
commending the idea of donating
gifts to the room in memory of the
student's life in Encina.
The following were elected on
the board of trustees: '98 —J. M.
Switzer and C. M. Fickert; '99—
Ralph Arnold and O. C. Leiter; '00
—Alfred Haslaeher and Bert
Lougheed; '01 —William Erb. The
committee meets this evening to
complete the organization.
At the conclusion of the business
meeting subscription lists were cir
culated to raise money for the pur
pose of obtaining copies of all of
the former Varsity team pictures
and to buy magazines, papers, and
other necessary supplies to make
the club-room attractive, About
one hundred dollars was subscribed,
half of which was collected. It is
the intention of the ball men to
formally open the new club-room
as soon as practicable. A reception
