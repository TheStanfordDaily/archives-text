On the twelfth of this month oc
curs the annual University Field
day. This affords a specific goal
which the track men, more es
pecially the newer men, can keep
in mind in their training. As it is
a handicap field-day all have a fair
chance to show exactly what they
are capable of. Many University,
records have been made in this
field-day, and the captain and
manager are always particularly j
watchful for '"dark horses." No
man can tell what he can do until;
he appears in a contest. No man
can do himself justice without some i
training. All freshmen turn out!
for two weeks' training.
