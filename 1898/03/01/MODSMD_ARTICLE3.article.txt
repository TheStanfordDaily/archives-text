Win. L. Stead spoke of the origin
of the Passion Play at Ober-Am
mergau as follows: "In the twelfth
century there bad been a Passion
Play performed in the little vil
lsige, but toward the close of the
sixteenth century the wars that
wasted Germany left but little time
even to the dwellers in these re
mote highlands for dramatic repre
sentation. As one of the remote
after-consequences of those wars a
great pestilence broke out in the
villages surrounding Ober-Ammer
gau. Whole families were swept
off. In one village only two mar
ried couples were left. Ober-Am
mergau quarantined itself against
the world, and their preventative
measures were for a while successful.
A native of the town, Caspar
Schuler, who had been working in
one of the afflicted towns, evaded
the watch and returned to his wife
and children in Ober-Ammergau.
A terrible retribution! In ten days
he was dead, and the plague which
he had brought back with him
spread with such fatal haste from
house to house that in thirty-three
days eighty-four had perished.
Sanitary measures had failed.
Curative measures were utterly
useless. It was as men looking
into the hollow eye-sockets of
death that the Ober-Ammergauers
cried aloud to God. They remem
bered their sins that day. They
would repent, and in token of their
penitence and asasign of gratitude
for their deliverance they would
every ten years perform the Passion
Play. From that hour the plague
was stayed. Thus it was that the
Passion Play became a fixed insti
tution in Ober-Ammergau, and has
been performed with a few varia
tions, due to wars —such as that
which summoned the Christ of
1870 to come down from the cross
to serve in the Bavarian artillery —
ever since."
