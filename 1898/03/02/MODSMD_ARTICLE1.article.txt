# FRESHMEN THE VICTORS.
## Inter-Class Baseball Championship Won by Naughty-One in an Exciting Game. 
### 
With four Varsity players and
several prominent Varsity candi
dates, among whom were two prom
ising aspirants for the position of
pitcher, the Sophomore Class base
hall nine was defeated by the
Freshman team on the campus
yesterday afternoon by a score of
9 to 7. By this game, the last of
the series, the inter-class champion
ship went to the infant class. To
win the class-headship in baseball
from a class which itself carried off
that distinction last season, speaks
well for the Freshman Class, and is
an encouraging sign when the
make-up of the future Varsities is
under consideration.
The Freshman team won the
game because it did much better at
critical times than the opposing
nine. Their tielding was much
surer and their batting was quite
as good. Wrigley pitched a steady
game and Swindells caught much
better than in the Alumni-Varsity
match. Rood at short did the star
work for the "freshies." The work
of Bentley at first also deserves fa
vorable mention.
In the Sophomore nine those
from whom the most was expected
did the poorest work. The team
was not only weak in fielding, but
the batting was not as strong as
it should have been. Beckett and
Lanagan pitched steadily, but re
ceived poor support. The score
and summary tell the tale.
The spirit shown by the '01
Class is a lively one. Its members
outnumbered the Sophomores at
at least two to one. Confident in
their strength, the "freshies" were
able to josh with impunity and to do
things which in the old days would
have caused "something to be do
ing."
