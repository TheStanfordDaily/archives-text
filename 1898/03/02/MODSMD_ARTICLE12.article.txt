Tomorrow's game is one «>f the
few games which are to he played
on the oampUß this year, and
thin reason, if no other, adds addi
tional interest to the contest, lia.se
hall experts in their comments this
season have laid particular stress
on the fact that our team shows no
ginger and no spirit, and the games
we have seen on the campus have
heen slow and listless. The' need
of putting life and enthusiasm into
the team is felt by every one famil
iar with the team's play, and to
morrow is the time to do it Spec
tators at Varsity games might learn
a few things from the contest yes
terday, which certainly gave evi
dence of spirit. Santa Clara has
already defeated hoth universities,
and an attempt, should be made to
recover our lost honors.
In an editorial called forth re
cently hy the deplorable stale of
tennis interests in the University,
we said: ''It is not like Stanford to
he defeated in any contest without
at least trying to prevent it." Our
pride in the University spirit causes
us to hesitate to retract our state
men', but it is not the policy of
this paper to stand hy an improver)
assertion. We have every con
fidence in our University spirit, but
alongside of this we must place the
indisputable fact that the tennis
players in the University are not
showing evidence of it. The most
we can do is to warn, with the ad
ditional encouragement that we be
lieve our racquet wielders capable
of much if they will only rise to
the occasion. We lost the cham
pionship last year through lack of
attention to it. Let us not repeat
the performance.
