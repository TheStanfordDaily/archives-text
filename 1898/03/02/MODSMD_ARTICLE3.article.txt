# College-Bred Journalists.

in an address at the University of
Wisconsin on "College-bred jour
nalists" Mr. R. G. Thwaites said:
"The better class of the public and
the better class of journalists are
clamoring for reform in the jour
nalism of today. Press clubs in
our universities are exercising a
good influence. College-bred men
and women are needed to uplift
the profession. They carry into
practice the accepted doctrine of
the class-room, and can come
nearer to the true life and condi
tion of the people than others. I
have faith in journalism, chiefly
because college-bred men are enter
ing upon the work, and they will
help to restore the American news
paper to its true dignity."
