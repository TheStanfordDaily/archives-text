# Lecture of Captain Miller.
## 
### 
The Tuesday evening lecture was
given upon request by Professor
Walter Miller, who talked on "How
1 became a captain in the Greek
Army." "Greece is not and never
has been dead," was one of the lec
turer's introductory statements, and
he proceeded to make Greece live
for his audience by a vivid descrip
tion of a trip through that part of
Attica most highly charged with
historic interest. Near Marathon
two Albanians took advantage of
his unarmed condition to rifle his
pockets and leave him unconscious
by the road. After several further
adventures he reached Athens,
where a friendly official gave him
a commission and a uniform, and
placed some twenty soldiers at his
disposal, that he might search for
the brigands. The account of the
search and capture made a most
entertaining narrative, ending, as
poetic justice demanded, with the
imposing of a five years' sentence
upon his assailants.
