# With the Chess Men.

### 
Next Saturday at 9:30 a.m. the
Intercollegiate Chess Tournament
will be held in the parlors of the
Mark Hopkins Institute of Art in
San Francisco. The Stanford team
was chosen last Friday and con
sists of Serpas, '99, Arnold, '99,
Veuve, '99, Knecht, '99, Van
Kaathoven, '99, and Wright, '01.
During the last few days the
team has been devoting itself to a
study of gambits from the best au
thorities on chess, and the remain
der of the time before the tourna
ment will be devoted to a constant
practice among the members of the
team. The players this year are
all new men, except Serpas, who
was on last year's team ; and for
this reason Stanford will be some
what handicapped in the contest
next Saturday. The Stanford play
ers have greatly improved since
the team was chosen, and with the

determination to win which each
individual man possesses the
chances in the tournament are not
so dubious as they might be.
In order to hold the tournament
in the Hopkins Institute of Art it
was found necessary to issue invi
tations, which must he presented at
the door. These invitations may
be obtained from President Erie
Veuve of the Chess Club or from
any member of the team. The
players would be greatly encouraged
if there could be a large Stanford
delegation present among the visit
ors to the tournament.
