The question of a general as
sembly hall for the University has
been settled and the greatest
in our University community today
is to be satisfied. Architect Hodges
is authority for the statement that
work will be commenced on a gen
eral assembly hall as soon as plans
and specifications are drawn up
and the contractors have figured
on it. This will probably delay
the beginning of the work until the
latter part of the present semester
or the first months of the summer
vacation.
The building, which iB to con
form to the present style of Uni
versity architecture as nearly as pos
sible, is to be situated on the road
running to Dr. Jordan's home and
on a line with the Museum, facing
toward Encina. The seating capa
city will be 1500, although interior
arrangements will make it possible
to seat 500 more by using the aisles,
etc. Exact plans for the proposed
edifice have not yet been decided
upon, but the interior will be simi
lar to all assembly halls —a large
assembly room with gallery above,
the seats being arranged in amphi
theatre style, the floor sloping up
ward from the rostrum. This room
will be sufficiently large to contain
the entire student body together
with others of the University com
munity who are frequent attend
ants upon our lectures and Sunday
services, without uncomfortably
crowding or jamming, as is exper
ienced with the present facilities.
