# SANTA CLARA WINS.
## Varsity Outclassed by Their Clever Opponents in a Good Game of Ball. 
### 
The Santa Clara College baseball
nine met the Varsity on the campus
diamond this afternoon. The col
lege nine began the game in their
usual fast style and played the
same consistent game that has won
them the former matches of the
season against the two Varsity
nines. The Santa Clara boys kept
up their batting record by colliding
with everything that came near the
plate. The Varsity played the
game with more ginger than usual
but do not get up on their toes and
rush the game as their younger op
ponents do.
Santa Clara played a strong
fielding game. In comparison with
Santa Clara the Varsity is sadly
deficient in the way of coaching the
men off. The Varsity fielding game
was strong, considering the strong
batting team they mixed with.
Wrigley's work in the box speaks
well for the Freshman twirler, his
work after the first inning being
especially strong. He was a bit
nervous in the first, when he al
lowed five hits. But one other hit
was made up to the sixth inning.
Graham's long hit to center for
a run was one of the most beau
tiful pieces of stick work seen on
the campus this season. The base
running of both teams was of the
first order. Strohn's throwing to
second was strong, but in other as
sist work his showing was not as
good as usual. Harris' three
bagger in the sixth was the longest
hit for Stanford. Stanford made
a double play in the eighth, Wrig
ley to Harris to Lougheed.
