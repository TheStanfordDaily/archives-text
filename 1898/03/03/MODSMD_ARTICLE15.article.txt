the question submitted by us for
the Intercollegiate Debate. Our
debaters know now exactly where
they stand. For them there is but
one thing to do —to begin immedi

work, which brought us victory
last year, and keep it up until the
issue is decided. There is, however,
another part to be played: ihat of
the students and faculty. It is the
duty of every student to aid the
men who are to uphold the Cardi
