The leading article in the Arena
in on "Trusts" by Senator Butler.
The instruments of commerce are
money, transportation, and trans
mission of intelligence, and they
are controlled by a few men. If
their use were regulated by the
public the maintainance of indus
trial trusts would be impossible;
this was the policy of the
founders of our government.
In"The Victory of the Van
quished," the Hon. Charles A.
Towne gives statistics pointing to a
Silver Party victory in 1900, and
places a stigma upon "Hannaism."
Mr. Anthony Dimock contributes
a somewhat confusing and jocular
article on "Currency Reform."
Francis E. Woodruff, in an article
following, is opposed to "A Single
Standard for the World." George
Wilson defends Socialism and
criticises Commissioner Harris
in an article "Statistics and Soc
ialism." "Pingree Potato Culture"
is a vivid picture of the crises that
never pass.
