After the game today Joe Corbett,

the Santa Clara coach, was inter
viewed on the strong and weak
points of our team. He said: "It
is very hard for me to say much
about the team as a whole on ac
count of the broken make-up. In
dividually the men are good field
ers, hut their batting ami their gen
eral knowledge of the game is hardly
up to class. They do not seem capa
ble of doing things when it is nec
essary. Their batting is hard but
not sure. They are too eager to
get at the ball. Quick, snappy
meeting of the ball would give
better general results."
When asked to draw a compari
son between Berkeley and Stan
ford teams, he answered: "1 think
that Stanford has a shade the bet
ter of it. You are stronger behind
the bat and in fielding, but you do
not have the ginger and the snap
of the Berkeley men. Your pitch
ing department is, 1 think, better
that California's. 1 like Beckett
better than any college pitcher
around here, and 1 think be could
be coached into a first-class man.
No. I have not seen Lanagan at
work."
Corbett will return to Baltimore
in about a month.
