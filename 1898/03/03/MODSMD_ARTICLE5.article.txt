# Varsity Games.
## 
### 
The last game of baseball in the
present league between the Varsity
and Alumni teams will in all prob
ability be played on the campus
Saturday, March 11. Manager
Keesling in attempting to have
this game come off on the home
diamond is yielding to the general
demand of the University commun
ity for more games on the campus.
In addition to this the games in the
city thus far have been conducted
on a losing basis, and by playing
on the campus the expenses are ma
terially lessened and the receipts
increased.
On March 17 the Varsity will
again cross bats with the crack
Santa Clara nine, for the benefit of
charity. The game will be played
in San Jose, the proceeds to go to
the Pratt Home, an institution for
aged women in adverse circum
stances, situated in San Jose.
