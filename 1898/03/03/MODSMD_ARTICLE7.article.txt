# "THE PASSION PLAY."
## Dr. Jordan Lectured to a Large Audience Last Evening for the Benefit of '98. 
### 
The lecture for the benefit of the
Senior Class by President Jordan
last evening on the Passion Play
was a success as a lecture and also
financially. The 'i*B Annual is
$70 nearer the end of its troubles
by the result of the lecture.
After an historical introduction,
President Jordan showed the
dissimilarity between the Pas
sion Play and the miracle
plays in vogue in early times
as a means of presenting concretely
great religious truths to the people.
This difference lies chiefly in the
fact that the Passion Play lacks the
crudities of the early plays, and
has entirely eliminated the super
stitious elements, presenting a
faithful and modern representa
tion of the life of Christ. The
devil, the clown of miracle plays,
has entirely disappeared.
The story goes that in 1634 the
Black Death visited Ober-Animer
gau. In consequence the people
vowed that if God would stop the
plague they would repeat the story
of the Passion every ten years.
The plague ceased and this was re
garded as a sign of heavenly ap
proval. Since that time the play
lias been given regularly every ten
years with one exception —in 1870,
on account of the Franco-Prussian
war.
The theatre accommodates five
thousand people. In the per
formance everything is real; there
is no artificial glare, everything
taking place in the open air and
sunshine. The actors do not seem
to act; tradition makes them like
the characters they represent. The
play represents various scenes in
the life of Christ: The entry into
Jerusalem, the scene in the temple,
the Last Supper, the scene in the
Garden of Gethsemane, the denial
of Peter, and Christ's judgment,
crucifixion, and rise from the dead.
The various characters and
scenes were presented last evening
by stereopticon slides.
