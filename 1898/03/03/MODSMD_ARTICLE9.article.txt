# Basket-Ball Notes.
## 
### 
Interest in basket-ball is at a
higher pitch than at any time since
last summer. The Castilleja team
practices with the Stanford team
once a week regularly.. The Castil

lejas are already beginning to feel
the benefit of their running track.
If our own athletic grounds are not
speedily put in order and the pro
posed track built, our team may
find scores turned against it in
future games.
The Lowell High School team,
which played our team on the
campus not long ago, is improving
steadily under the coaching of Miss
Ada Edwards. In a match game
with the Central Y. W. C. A. team
last Saturday they defeated the
latter 11 to 4.
Curtner Seminary at Irvington
now has a Stanford basket-ball
coach. Frances Tucker, '99, cap
tain of the Stanford team, has been
engaged to instruct them weekly.
