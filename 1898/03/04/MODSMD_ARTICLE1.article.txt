# ATHLETIC COMMITTEE.
## Various Important Matters Considered and Acted Upon at Today's Meeting. 
### 
There was a well-attended meet
ing of the Athletic Committee this
afternoon. Dr. Angel 1 was also
present. Several important mat
ters were brought up for considera
tion.
The athletic agreement drawn
up last Saturday by the intercol
legiate committee was taken up
section by section and discussed
thoroughly. The provision for
holding the bicycle race on the
Wednesday before the Field-day
met with considerable objection,
the committee seeing no reason
why the race should not take
place on the same day as the other
iield events, and it was finally de
cided not to ratify the section con
taining that provision, and Secre
tary Fisher was instructed to
notify the U. C. committee of the
action.
The trip of the Freshman base
ball team to San Jose tomorrow to
play the Normal School nine came
up for consideration, no permission
to make the trip having been ob
tained from the committee by the
Freshman manager. It was car
ried that the Freshmen should not
be allowed to make the trip unless
they obtained permission from Sec
retary Fisher.
Paul Walker was elected tem
porary track captain during the
absence of John Brunton, and he
was also given Brunton's place on
the committee.
The proposed trip of the baseball
nine to Reno, Nevada, was author
ized.
