The Client? Tournament takes
place tomorrow in San Francisco.
Everybody who can should attend
and see that if we are beaten it will
not he on account of lack of sup
port; if we win, the players should
have a large enough crowd to give
them suitable congratulations.
The hour is-somewhat inconvenient,
but all the more honor will accrue
to those who do attend, on that ac
count.
