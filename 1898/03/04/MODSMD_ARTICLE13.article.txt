Theke is a disease prevalent in
college circles, commonly known as
the "sign-swiping mania." It is
generally supposed to be a sopho
moric short-coming, but late events
at Stanford prove it not wholly
confined to this maligned class.
Specifically, the treasurer of the
'98 Class, in his efforts to reduce |
the class debt and to minimize the 1
assessment, has had made on sev
eral occasions various posters and
placards to call attention to such
lectures and entertainments as
have been given for the benefit of
the Senior Class. Members of the
class to be benefited —and feminine
members at that (perhaps they sup
pose their sex excuses the theft),
have wilfully despoiled post
office and bulletin board of posters
meant to benefit the class as a
whole, and not particular mem
bers. These posters were taken
long before their usefulness was
over. If the "fiends" would wait
until after the advertised show was
over, it would not be so bad, but in
any case the posters belong to the
person who caused them to be made
or to the person who made them, and
not to individuals who have the
nerve to possess themselves of them.
