# A 						Musicale by Mr. Savanah.
## 
### 
On Tuesday evening, March 15, in
place of a lecture there will be a
musical program by Mr. S. Savan
nah.
Mr. Savannah is a young man
studying under Professor Beall of
San Francisco, the noted violinist.
At the musicale given last month
by the Delta Upsilon fraternity
Mr. Savannah and Miss Griffin,
the well known pianist of San
Francisco, were the musicians of
the evening. It is not known
whether Miss Griffin will ac
company him or not. Those
who heard Mr. Savannah at the
Delta Upsilon musicale were so en
thusiastic in their appreciation of
his technique and finished execu
tion that they determined the en
tire Stanford community should
be given an opportunity to hear him.
It is through the efforts of a few of
these that this has been made pos
sible. As this takes the place of a
regular Tuesday evening lecture,
no admittance will be charged.
