iate Chess Tournament held in San

Mark Hopkins Institute of Art.

both university teams would not
be ranked as strong chess, but the
men of U. C. were stronger by far
in their play, as the score of to
in favor of U. C. indicates. Ser
pas, Stanford's best player, wan
only able to make a draw with
Park hurst of U. C., who is classed
second to Epstein of the Berkeley
players. Veuve of Stanford played
Epstein a good game, although he
overlooked a situation which would
have made the game closer and the
result more problematical.
Each University was represented
by six men who were divided into
three groups representing the
strongest, the average, and the
weakest players, and each group
was pitted against the other. The
University of California had among
its representatives two of last year's
team, Epstein and Parkhurst,
while Serpas was the only Stanford
man who had competed in the for
mer match. Epstein and Park
hurst were against Serpas and
Veuve.

follows: At table No. I—Parkhurst,
U. C., and Serpas, S. No. 2—Ep

Whitaker, S. No. s—Euphrat,5—Euphrat, U.
C., and Arnold, S. No. 6 —Baugh,
U.C., and Knecht, S.

by Van Kaathoven,'99, on a penal
ized move by Towle. According
to the rules, a piece once touched

alized for touching a piece and im
mediately resigned. Knecht, '99,
was also penalized, thereby losing
his chances of winning.
The contest between Serpas and
Parkhurst was not decided until
afternoon, the play having started
at 9:80 in the morning. Serpas
for a time appeared to have the
advantage, but Parkhurst's game
was too strong for anything better
than a draw, which was made in
59 moves.

by Epstein after 43 moves. Van
Kaathoven won in 31, Hohfeld
from Whitaker in 47, Euphrat
