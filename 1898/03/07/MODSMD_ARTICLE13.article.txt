It becomes our duty to record
nuother defeat for the second semes
ter of this year, that of the Inter
collegiate Chess Tournament. It is
one of the features of college jour
nalism at Stanford that in the first
semester we have only to prepare
to record victories, while in the
second semester we sharpen our
pencils and point our pens to tell
of the U. C. triumphs and between
these acknowledgments of defeat
are interspersed appeals to the
student body to prepare for the
next intercollegiate contest, and
prophesies that defeat will confront
us in certain contests unless more
men come out, unless those men
out are more faithful to their work,
and unless the student body gives
stronger support to the Stanford
teams.
Whether our enthusiasm is spent
at the annual triumph of Thanks
giving Day, so that we have none
to spare for the six intercollegiate
contests of the second semester, or
our appetite for victory is satiated
by the unprecedented scores of the
Varsity football contests for the
last two years, is something incap
able of solution. It is evident, at
any rate, that there is not as much
enthusiastic support of the second
semester teams. When teams are
not backed by college spirit in all
its strength, how can we hope for
victory? What the teams need is
united support, and some evidence
that their efforts are appreciated.
This, none of the teams has had
this year; and unless there is an
immediate change Berkeley need
fear nothing in the remaining con
tests of the year.
