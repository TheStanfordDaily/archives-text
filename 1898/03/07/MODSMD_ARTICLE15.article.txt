The Oakland Enquirer has lately
been devoting some space to a dis
cussion of the merits or demerits of
the college publications on the
coast and has some rather perti
nent criticisms and comparisons to
make. It calls the Occident Berk
eley's literary weekly, the "Weekly
Jimmy Hopper'' and says that
for good, sprightly, editorials the
Occident is the best college paper
on the coast. The Sequoia conies
in for its share of praise on its fine
appearance and its distinctly local
character. "If one wants a glimpse
of university life, Stanford life, let
him read the Sequoia." Editor Cool
idge is characterized as the "college
Hamlin Garland." The University
of California Magazine, published
by the Alumni of Berkeley, is
praised as giving money's worth,
though not of college matter.
The Daily Palo Alto comes in
for a share of praise, and has had
its full comment on the Carnot
Debate and Mr. Murdock's letter
reprinted, with comments on the
policy of the paper.
