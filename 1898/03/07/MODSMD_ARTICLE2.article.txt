# University Sermon.

### 
Yesterday J)r. Thoburn gave the
sermon "Nature and God" which
was postponed a week ago. He
said that never before had he met
bo many people whom he had to
convince that they really were re
ligious, they maintainii.g that they
were not. The whole difficulty lies
in the meaning given to "religious.' 1
Every man must, by his very con
stitution, have some religion. Stu
dents finding that they can not ac
cept old forms and dogmas, and
failing to see the underlying truth,
cast the whole aside and declare
that they have no religion. It is

the old "warfare between knowledge
and religion" which never existed
Religion is an integral and inevita
hie part of man's character, but
reason is just as essential and just
as divine. We must increase our
knowledge. The problem for us is
to have our religion keep pace with
our knowledge. But if we are men
it is impossible that our religion
should not increase as our knowl
edge grows.
Dr. Thoburn then emphasized the
fact that creeds and dogmas do not
make religion, which is "devotion
in action." But we as rational be
ings must study our religion and
question our beliefs. The old "ar
gument. from design" for the exist
ence of God proved only a great
First Cause. As we study this
Cause we see that it acts as we
should act if we were all-powerful.
Jt exhibits mind. Such a force we
can worship. We tremble before
the awful mystery and majesty of
this Veiled Ruler of the universe,
but we can not love it. It is only
when we realize that we are indeed
the sons of God, that is when we
realize that in us are the beginnings
of what makes God our Father, what
he is, that we approach him with
the true spirit of modern religion.
With this attitude toward God all
growth in every direction will
strengthen our religion.
Before the sermon Dr. Elliott
spoke of the needs of the Chapel
Union. Not all the money pledged
last semester has been received, and
as there is some money still due for
the new hymnals, it will be neces
sary to raise just about the same
amount as was obtained last semes
ter. Walter Clark, '99, the treas
urer of the union, who is in the
Secretary's office, or Dr. Elliott, or
Dr. Thoburn will receive subscrip
tions. â€¢
