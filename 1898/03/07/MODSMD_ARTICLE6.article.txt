# PRAISE FROM ABROAD.
## Message of Esteem Received from the Royal Academy of Sciences of Bavaria. 
### 
The following is an extract from
a letter received by President Jor
dan from Dr. Max von Pettenkofer
of the K. B. Acadeniie der Wis
senschaften of Munich, Germany.
As showing the reputation which
the University and the Hopkins
Seaside Laboratory are acquiring
abroad, it may be of interest to the
readers of the Daily Palo Alto.
Mr. Franz Doffein will, of course,
be granted the courtesy which is
sought.
"It is known that the Leland
Stanford Junior University has ac
complished the great service for it
self of erecting on the bay of
Monterey, near Pacific Grove, Cal
ifornia, a marine zoological sta
tion. The richness of this bay in
marine and plant forms which
hitherto were scarcely accessible
to science gives to this newly-estab
lished station an equal if not
higher significance for zoological
investigation than that which has
been attained in the old world by
the zoological station at Naples.
"Meanwhile the Royal Academy
of Sciences of Bavaria brings to
this university in California, for
this most useful foundation, its
thanks and good wishes. To these
it adds at once the request that the
young zoologist, Dr. Franz Dofiein,
may be accepted with friendly re
ception in this Hopkins Seaside
Laboratory for three months of the
summer this year.
"With the most earnest wishes
that the near bond which unites
the scientific bodies of America
and Germany will draw them
closer in the future, the Acadetnie
sends its colleague university in
California a greeting full of the
highest esteem."
