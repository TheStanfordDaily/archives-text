# Alumni Defeat U.C.
## 
### 
The Alumni team won a victory
from U. C. Saturday by a Bcore of
7to 0. Krug pitched against the
college men and is responsible
largely for the Alumni's success,
although good batting, base run
ning, and fielding marked the play
of the consolidated team. In the
ninth inning Toby Allen knocked
out a home run off Kaarsburg when
three men were on bases. U. C.
made seven errors to one by the
Alumni, and four hits to the Alum
ni's nine. The encouraging feature
of the game from a Stanford stand
point was the failure of the U. C.
men to line out the ball. Stanford,
in the game in which Krug pitched,
was credited with ten hits.
