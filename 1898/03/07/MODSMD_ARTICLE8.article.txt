# Freshmen Defeat Normal School.
## 
### 
The Freshmen defeated the Nor
mal School at San Jose Saturday
hy a score of 14 to 11. The Fresh
men got twelve hits to their oppo
nents eight, Rood and Lawrence
leading in the batting. Edwards
held down third in good style.
His faculty of waiting until pre
sented with a base on balls stood
him well in hand. Although only
twice at bat, he made three runs.
His base running was good, and he
accepted seven chances without an
error. Rood played a dashing
game at short. He cut off at least

two hits by his good fielding, and
his catch of a fly almost in left
field in the eighth inning was one
of the features of the game. His
weak point seems to be in control
ling his arm. Swindells appeared
to have an off day. Russ struck
out five men and sent the same
number to base. Marten fanned
six and gave bases to ten men.
The Normal team has two good
players, Weed and Rickabaugh.
The latter at short captured eleven
hard chances without a misplay.
His hitting and base running were
far ahead of any other member of
the team.
