# NO BASKET-BALL.
## Stanford Girls Refuse Berkeley's Terms for the Intercollegiate Match. 
### 
Basket-ball matters are at a
standstill. The following challenge
had been received by the Stanford
team, but owing to a disagreement
between the two teams as to details
of the match it was not accepted,
thereby removing all prospects for
an intercollegiate match.
University of California,
Feb. '28, 1898.
Milis Londa L. Stebbins, Manager of
the Stanford Basket-Ball Team:
The basket-ball team of the Uni
versity of California hereby chal
lenges the basket-ball team of Stan
ford University to a match game
of basket-ball, and respectfully
suggests the 19th or the 26th of
March as the date on which the
game may be played. The game
must be played under the same
conditions as our last gume. If
this meets your approval 1 will be
pleased to meet you on Saturday,
March 5, in the ladies' room of the
Palace Hotel at 2:30 p.m. to further
arrange for the game.
Mary C McCleave,
Manager of University of
California Basket-Bail Team.
Inasmuch as it is the privilege of
the challenged party to name place
and date of contest, the team saw
from the first that it was out of the
question to consider the above chal
lenge as it stood. However, the
basket-ball manager and the chair
man of the basket-ball committee
were appointed to confer with simi
lar representatives from Berkeley.
At this conference, held in San
Francisco on Saturday, the Stan
ford representatives maintained
that since, in the last intercollegiate
game, we had consulted their prefer
ence and played indoors, that this
time it was only fair to give Stan
ford the advantage and play out of
doors. Neutral ground was named
which would be free from undesir
able spectators. The Berkeley
manager could not but admit the
justice of our claim, and returned
to Berkeley to consider the matter
of re-cliallenging Stanford in away
that could be accepted. Word was
received yesterday from Berkeley
that on no condition could they
play except in a San Francisco
gymnasium as before. Here the
matter rests. It is a disappoint
ment to the team not to meet Ber
keley this year,but there is a rea on
able prospect of meets with other
Coast teams, some of which are re
ported to be doing excellent work.
