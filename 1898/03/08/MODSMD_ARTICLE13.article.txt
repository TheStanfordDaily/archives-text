Founders' Day at the University,
and the significance (if the day will
be brought out hy the exercises of
the evening. At such a time it be
hooves us who are the recipients of
the bounty of the Founders of the
University to put ourselves closer
in touch with their motives and
desires, which, as stated in the
University charter, were to qual
ify students for personal success
and direct usefulness in life "and
"to promote the public welfare by
exercising an influence in behalf of
humanity and civilization, teach
ing the blessings of liberty regu
lated by law, and inculcating love
and reverence for the great princi
ples of government as derived from
the inalienable rights of man to
life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness."
We all appreciate theadvantages
we receive from this institution,
and by observing the true spirit of
the day set apart for the honor of
the Founders we can openly ac
knowledge the debt which every
student should feel he owes to his
alvKi mater.
