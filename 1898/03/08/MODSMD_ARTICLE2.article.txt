# Sheehan Talks Baseball.

### 
"Jack" Sheehan,'9s, our baseball
coach and former Varsity captain,
was interviewed today on the pol
icy with which he would conduct
the coaching of the team. He
said: "The men are now in a
slump. 1 shall first endeavor to
awaken them and get more interest
and 'ginger' in their game. The
men will then be coached for a
week or so on the general knowl
edge of the game, in which they
are sadly lacking. After a week or
more of thorough arousing we
shall go to work on the fine points,
such as bunting, the use of the sac
rifice hit, coaching, and base run

ning.
"The pitching department is
! very strong this year, and we ought
Ito have no difficulty in this line,
j Beckett is showing marked im
' provement in his style and form,
i Lanagan has a sore arm and he
will be given a lay-off from work
in the box for a week. There if* a
tendency on the part of all of the
pitchers to do too much work in
fielding passed hulls on tlr* throw
back, etc. They will be given a
drill to overcome this fault and in
handling short hits and bunts.
''The infielder's work will consist
chiefly in learning who is to take
the ball and what he is to do with
it. Many runs are saved by a
j sharp command telling where to
I ihrow the ball.
"I would like to see more men
trying for the outfield positions.
These positions will be given to
the surest hitters.
''Every day during the time I am
down here the men will lie coached
in their batting, both as individ
uals and as a team.
"I shall organize a second nine
and appoint a captain, and every
afternoon the Varsity and this
team will play a five-inning game.
A great deal will depend on these
games, and changes will be made
when warranted.
"Let me say before you go that
what is wanting as much as any
thing is 'ginger' 011 the part of the
players and the 'rooters.' "
Sheehan will remain here at
least five weeks and perhaps
longer.
