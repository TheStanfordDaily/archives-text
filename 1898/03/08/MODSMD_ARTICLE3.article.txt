# A 						Lecture on Oriental Rugs.
## 
### 
Hadji Ephraitn Benquiat will
give in the chapel Thursday after
noon, March 10, at '2 o'clock, a talk
on the manufacture and history of
Persian and Oriental rugs. He will
exhibit a large number of very val
uable rugs and embroideries in il
lustration of his lecture. It was
intended that this lecture should
come in the Tuesday evening series,
but daylight being essential to a
proper display of the rugs an
afternoon hour has been chosen.
Dr. Jordan desires to call special
attention to this lecture, as it is
given at his request.
