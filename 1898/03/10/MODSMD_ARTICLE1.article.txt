## The 						Fifth Annual Celebration of the Day Appropriately Observed Yesterday. 
### 
The chapel was well filled last
evening for the occasion of cele
brating the anniversary of the
birthday of Senator Stanford and
the passage of I he act by the legis
lature making the building of the
University possible. The chancel
of the chapel was beautifully deco
rated for the occasion. Upon the
platform were Dr. Jordan, the Hon
orable Francis E. Spencer, presi
dent of the Hoard of Trustees, and
Professor A. G. Newcomer.
The exercises were opened with
the "Cavalier Song" by Dr. George
Blakesley Little. Dr. Jordan then
introduced the speaker of the even
ing, Mr. Spencer, who spoke in part
as follows:
Ladictf and Gentlemen:
Meeting together as we do on this
occasion to commemorate the natal
day of one of the founders of this
temple of learning that has thus
early in its career sent forth good
fruits from the tree of knowledge,
reared by its fostering care, it seems
appropriate to indulge in some
reminiscences of his life and career.
Leland Stanford was born seventy
four years ago today, at the village
of Watervliet in the State of New
York, near the city of Albany. He
was of good New England parent
age on both his father's and his
mother's side. His father, Josiah
Stanford, was of good English stock
with a strain of Irish blood. Young
Stanford at the age of twenty years
commenced the study of law with a
prominent firm of attorneys at Al
bany. He assiduously applied
himself to acquiring a good know
ledge of his chosen profession and
at the end of three years was ad
mitted to the bar. He then cast
about him for a favorable location
to practice his profession, and an
ticipating Horace Greeley's advice
to "Go West, young man," he lo
cated in 1848 at Port Washington
in Wisconsin, on Lake Michigan.
After establishing a good practice
he returned to Albany and there
married Jane Lathrop, the daughter
of Dyer Lathrop, a prominent and
honored citizen of that city. Re
turning to Port Washington he
continued in practice until 1852
when he suffered the misfortune of
losing by fire his oflice and effects,
including his law library, but as
the sequel proved it was in reality
a disguised blessing. It was the
immediate cause of his decision to
seek his fortune in the new El
Dorado on the Pacific which was
then holding out glittering prom
ises to men of brain and courage.
Mr. Stanford went to New York
and there made his way by water,
crossing Nicaragua and arrived in
San Francisco July 12, 1852, and
shortly thereafter found his way to
the mining districts of the State
and engaged in merchandizing at
Cold Springs, El Dorado county,
and in the following spring estab
lished a store at Michigan liar,
Placer county. He also engaged in
mining enterprises which in the
main proved successful. He was
engaged in business in the mines
for several years, and there laid the

foundation of a comfortable fortune
In 1855 he removed to Sacra
mento and purchased the mercan
tile business of his brother. The
same year he went East and brought
back his wife and together they
made their home in the Capital
City.
Jt was in the winter of 1860 on
the occasion of the meeting of the
Presidential Electoral College to
cast the vote of this State for
Abraham Lincoln, that I with a
number of friends had the honor of
breakfasting with Mr. and Mrs.
Stanford at their lovely home.
Against his inclination and with
out much hope of being elected Mr.
Stanford accepted the nomination
of his party for Governor of this
State at its convention held on the
Bth day of June, 1859. He was
selected to lead a forlorn hope, for
the party organization at that time
was in its infancy. Milton S.
Latham, his opponent, was elected,
though Mr. Stanford, under the
circumstances, received a remark
ably flattering vote. But un
daunted by defeat the prominent
men of his party appreciating and
admiring the ability and fitness
displayed by their standard bearer,
he was at the next Republican con
vention, held on the 18th of June,
1861, again nominated for the same
high oflice. The election took place
on September 4, resulting in a
flattering majority in favor of Mr.
Stanford, over the combined vote of
his two competitors. After the ex
piration of his gubernatorial term
his extensive private and railroad
interests demanded his undivided
attention, and he declined to allow
his name to be used in connection
with any public oflice, until the
fall of IHB4, when his personal
friends and political supporters
prevailed upon him to become a
candidate for the United States
Senate, and on January 28, 1885,
he was elected to that high oflice in
joint assembly over his opponent,
James T. Farley, for the full term
of six years, and in 1891 was re
elected to succeed himself, and
held the oflice at the time of
his death. It was, however, as
one of the governing spirits who
projected and consummated the
grand railway system that spanned
valleys, o'ertopped mountains for
half the continent and afterwards
sent out its feeders to all parts of
the State and Coast, that he is best
known for the years that preceded
the establishing of this University.
He broached the subject to Mr. C.
P. Huntington, they discussed it
earnestly from time to time and
later on enlisted Charles Crocker
and Mark Hopkins in the scheme
An act was passed July 2, 18(>4, one
of the most important provisions
of which was to give the railroad
companies the right to raise money
by mortgaging the road and mak
ing such mortgage lirst lien.
The work of subduing nature's
barriers of mountains and deserts
went rapidly on until the iron
bands of the Central Pacific Com
pany clasped those of the Union
Pacific eight hundred miles east of
the Pacific terminus and on the
10th of May, 1869, the grandest re
public of the world wore for the
first time a priceless girdle.

Senator and Mrs. Stanford were
the parents of an idolized child of
comely form and possessed of
moral and intellectual qualities of
high promise. This one on whom
their earthly affections were cen
tered, while traveling abroad, sick
ened and died on the 13th of
March, 1884, leaving the stricken
parents scion less.
The parents with their hold thus
loosened upon the material things
of this life resolved to do for the
youths of the country what they
had hoped to for their own, and at
the same time to perpetuate his
name by erecting a monument, not
of marble to crumble away in the
passing years, but by founding and
endowing an educational institu
tion bearing his name that would
afford the youth of the country, of
both sexes, opportunities for ac
quiring a liberal and practical ed
ucation, fitting them the better to
battle with the stern realities of
life. Upon examination of the
then existing legislation it was
found inadequate for the purpose
of founding an institution of the
contemplated scope and character,
and accordingly an act was passed
by the legislature of the State con
taining more appropriate pro
visions. It is a coincidence that I
take occasion to mention that this
act was approved on the 9th day
of March, 1885, the anniversary of
the day we are now assembled to
commemorate. The legal obstacles
being thus removed, on the 14th
day of November, 1885, they ex
ecuted their joint grant to twenty
four trustees therein named, found
ing and endowing the Leland
Stanford Junior University.
The absence of the Governor from
the State attending to official
duties delayed active operations,
and it was not until the 14th of
May, 1887, that work on the build
ings destined as the seat of the
University had sufficiently pro
gressed "or the laying of the corner
stone. The University was opened
for the admission of students on
the Ist day of October, 1891, over
live hundred being in attendance.
Senator Stanford was spared for
over a year and a half after this
memorable event to see the Uni
versity develop upon the lines he
had planned, its influence and pat
ronage more than doubled. He
builded better than he knew.
Of the two founders and twenty
four original trustees, twenty-six
in all, ten have already paid na
ture's debt. Rut a few years will
elapse when all the other original
actors in this founding will have
done likewise, and none will re
main to personally remind the
alumni and students of this Unir
versify. May I ask that in the
coining years you and those who
come after you will keep green in
your memories this anniversary
day and all that its observance sig
nifies ? 1 thank you.
At the close of the address Pro
fessor Newcomer was called upon
to give the "Memorial Ode" writ
ten by him for the occasion of the
first, memorial exercises in 1894.
The exercises closed with the
song "Adolar'' from Weber's
"Euryantha," by Miss Mary Pratt
Little.
The chapel was well filled last

brating the anniversary of the

Latham, his opponent, was elected,
though Mr. Stanford, under the
circumstances, received a remark
ably flattering vote. But un
daunted by defeat the prominent
men of his party appreciating and
admiring the ability and fitness
displayed by their standard bearer,
he was at the next Republican con
vention, held on the 18th of June,
1861, again nominated for the same
high oflice. The election took place
on September 4, resulting in a
flattering majority in favor of Mr.
Stanford, over the combined vote of
his two competitors. After the ex
piration of his gubernatorial term
his extensive private and railroad
interests demanded his undivided
attention, and he declined to allow
his name to be used in connection
with any public oflice, until the
fall of IHB4, when his personal
friends and political supporters
prevailed upon him to become a
candidate for the United States
Senate, and on January 28, 1885,
he was elected to that high oflice in
joint assembly over his opponent,
James T. Farley, for the full term
of six years, and in 1891 was re
elected to succeed himself, and
held the oflice at the time of
his death. It was, however, as
one of the governing spirits who
projected and consummated the
grand railway system that spanned
valleys, o'ertopped mountains for
half the continent and afterwards
sent out its feeders to all parts of
the State and Coast, that he is best
known for the years that preceded
the establishing of this University.
He broached the subject to Mr. C.
P. Huntington, they discussed it
earnestly from time to time and
later on enlisted Charles Crocker
and Mark Hopkins in the scheme
An act was passed July 2, 18(>4, one
of the most important provisions
of which was to give the railroad
companies the right to raise money
by mortgaging the road and mak
ing such mortgage lirst lien.
The work of subduing nature's
barriers of mountains and deserts
went rapidly on until the iron
bands of the Central Pacific Com
pany clasped those of the Union
Pacific eight hundred miles east of
the Pacific terminus and on the
10th of May, 1869, the grandest re
public of the world wore for the
first time a priceless girdle.

Senator and Mrs. Stanford were
the parents of an idolized child of
comely form and possessed of
moral and intellectual qualities of
high promise. This one on whom
their earthly affections were cen
tered, while traveling abroad, sick
ened and died on the 13th of
March, 1884, leaving the stricken
parents scion less.
The parents with their hold thus
loosened upon the material things
of this life resolved to do for the
youths of the country what they
had hoped to for their own, and at
the same time to perpetuate his
name by erecting a monument, not
of marble to crumble away in the
passing years, but by founding and
endowing an educational institu
tion bearing his name that would
afford the youth of the country, of
both sexes, opportunities for ac
quiring a liberal and practical ed
ucation, fitting them the better to
battle with the stern realities of
life. Upon examination of the
then existing legislation it was
found inadequate for the purpose
of founding an institution of the
contemplated scope and character,
and accordingly an act was passed
by the legislature of the State con
taining more appropriate pro
visions. It is a coincidence that I
take occasion to mention that this
act was approved on the 9th day
of March, 1885, the anniversary of
the day we are now assembled to
commemorate. The legal obstacles
being thus removed, on the 14th
day of November, 1885, they ex
ecuted their joint grant to twenty
four trustees therein named, found
ing and endowing the Leland
Stanford Junior University.
The absence of the Governor from
the State attending to official
duties delayed active operations,
and it was not until the 14th of
May, 1887, that work on the build
ings destined as the seat of the
University had sufficiently pro
gressed "or the laying of the corner
stone. The University was opened
for the admission of students on
the Ist day of October, 1891, over
live hundred being in attendance.
Senator Stanford was spared for
over a year and a half after this
memorable event to see the Uni
versity develop upon the lines he
had planned, its influence and pat
ronage more than doubled. He
builded better than he knew.
Of the two founders and twenty
four original trustees, twenty-six
in all, ten have already paid na
ture's debt. Rut a few years will
elapse when all the other original
actors in this founding will have
done likewise, and none will re
main to personally remind the
alumni and students of this Unir
versify. May I ask that in the
coining years you and those who
come after you will keep green in
your memories this anniversary
day and all that its observance sig
nifies ? 1 thank you.
At the close of the address Pro
fessor Newcomer was called upon
to give the "Memorial Ode" writ
ten by him for the occasion of the
first, memorial exercises in 1894.
The exercises closed with the
song "Adolar'' from Weber's
"Euryantha," by Miss Mary Pratt
Little.
The chapel was well filled last
evening for the occasion of cele
brating the anniversary of the
birthday of Senator Stanford and
the passage of I he act by the legis
lature making the building of the
University possible. The chancel
of the chapel was beautifully deco
rated for the occasion. Upon the
platform were Dr. Jordan, the Hon
orable Francis E. Spencer, presi
dent of the Hoard of Trustees, and
Professor A. G. Newcomer.
The exercises were opened with
the "Cavalier Song" by Dr. George
Blakesley Little. Dr. Jordan then
introduced the speaker of the even
ing, Mr. Spencer, who spoke in part
as follows:
Ladictf and Gentlemen:
Meeting together as we do on this
occasion to commemorate the natal
day of one of the founders of this
temple of learning that has thus
early in its career sent forth good
fruits from the tree of knowledge,
reared by its fostering care, it seems
appropriate to indulge in some
reminiscences of his life and career.
Leland Stanford was born seventy
four years ago today, at the village
of Watervliet in the State of New
York, near the city of Albany. He
was of good New England parent
age on both his father's and his
mother's side. His father, Josiah
Stanford, was of good English stock
with a strain of Irish blood. Young
Stanford at the age of twenty years
commenced the study of law with a
prominent firm of attorneys at Al
bany. He assiduously applied
himself to acquiring a good know
ledge of his chosen profession and
at the end of three years was ad
mitted to the bar. He then cast
about him for a favorable location
to practice his profession, and an
ticipating Horace Greeley's advice
to "Go West, young man," he lo
cated in 1848 at Port Washington
in Wisconsin, on Lake Michigan.
After establishing a good practice
he returned to Albany and there
married Jane Lathrop, the daughter
of Dyer Lathrop, a prominent and
honored citizen of that city. Re
turning to Port Washington he
continued in practice until 1852
when he suffered the misfortune of
losing by fire his oflice and effects,
including his law library, but as
the sequel proved it was in reality
a disguised blessing. It was the
immediate cause of his decision to
seek his fortune in the new El
Dorado on the Pacific which was
then holding out glittering prom
ises to men of brain and courage.
Mr. Stanford went to New York
and there made his way by water,
crossing Nicaragua and arrived in
San Francisco July 12, 1852, and
shortly thereafter found his way to
the mining districts of the State
and engaged in merchandizing at
Cold Springs, El Dorado county,
and in the following spring estab
lished a store at Michigan liar,
Placer county. He also engaged in
mining enterprises which in the
main proved successful. He was
engaged in business in the mines
for several years, and there laid the

foundation of a comfortable fortune
In 1855 he removed to Sacra
mento and purchased the mercan
tile business of his brother. The
same year he went East and brought
back his wife and together they
made their home in the Capital
City.
Jt was in the winter of 1860 on
the occasion of the meeting of the
Presidential Electoral College to
cast the vote of this State for
Abraham Lincoln, that I with a
number of friends had the honor of
breakfasting with Mr. and Mrs.
Stanford at their lovely home.
Against his inclination and with
out much hope of being elected Mr.
Stanford accepted the nomination
of his party for Governor of this
State at its convention held on the
Bth day of June, 1859. He was
selected to lead a forlorn hope, for
the party organization at that time
was in its infancy. Milton S.
Latham, his opponent, was elected,
though Mr. Stanford, under the
circumstances, received a remark
ably flattering vote. But un
daunted by defeat the prominent
men of his party appreciating and
admiring the ability and fitness
displayed by their standard bearer,
