# A 						GOOD PRACTICE.
## Varsity Shows Signs of Improvement in Yesterday's Game With the Freshmen. 
### 
The Varsity played a practice
game of baseball with the Freshman
team on the campus yesterday.
The feature of the game was the
ginger and snap displayed by the
men under the tutorship of "Jack"
Sheehan. The lack of these qual
ities has been the greatest ground
of complaint against the team up
to this time, but if the pace set yes
terday is a sample of what is to
follow, baseball bids fair to become
as popular this year as in the days
of the Pioneer teams.
The game yesterday was in the
nature of a practice in hitting and
fielding, the pitchers throwing easy
balls over the plate. The Varsity
nine made but four errors, their
fielding game being exceptionally
strong. One of the features of the
game was a double play from
Lougheed to Harris to Young.
Of the Freshman team, Swin
dells and Roberts showed the most
improvement in form. The final
score was 15 to 4 in favor of the
Varsity.
The teams played' as follow:
Varsity —Lougheed, ss; Strohn, c;
