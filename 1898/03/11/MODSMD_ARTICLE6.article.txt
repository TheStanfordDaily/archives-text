# Tuesday Evening Lecture.

### 
The lecture last Tuesday evening
was by Professor Lindgren of the
Geological department. He told of
the results of a reconnaissance in
western Idaho undertaken by him
last fall for the United States Geo
logical Survey to investigate the
geological features of the region
along the boundary line between
Oregon and Idaho where the Snake
river and its tributary, the Salmon,
break through the mountain bar
riers on their way to join the waters
of the Columbia. It was the pur
pose of the survey to ascertain the
boundaries of the great lava fields.
In the lecture he traced the
courses of the Snake and Salmon
rivers until they meet, describing
the formation of 4he country along
the canyon of each.
A narrow backbone separates
the lowest courses of the two rivers.
This backbone is known as the
Country of the Seven Devils.
More especially is this a name
given to a group of sharp peaks
rising more than 9000 feet. From
their summit a continuous slope
of 8000 feet, leads in a distance of
about three miles, down to the
Snake river, a rushing torrent of
green water enclosed between
black, abrupt, rock walls. The
general surface of the plateau is
from 5000 to 6000 feet above the
river. Eastward rises the granite
region of Central Idaho, an uplift
en viassc, scored by canyons but
without the form of a regular
mountain range. The peaks we
stand 011, jagged and rough, are
made up of rocks equally old as
the granite. Thirty miles across
the river—in Oregon--opposite the
Seven Devils, towers the Eagle
range clear cut against the sky to
the north of the plateau, gradually
sinking, stretches away in the hazy
distance. South and southwest ex
tends the same plateau, limited by
the Blue mountains.
Below that broad lava plateau
lie buried mountain ranges and
valleys, blotted out by the swiftly
succeeding flows. Only the very
highest, peaks, like the Seven Dev
ils and the Eagle range, now pro

trude above the monotonous sur
face.
Equally distinct as the geolog
ical formations in their boldly out
lined areas are the zones of vegeta
tion. Above <S00(J feet the ridges
and peaks are bare, flecked with
snowdrifts and scored. by rock
slides. Between 8000 and 4COO
feet lies the greaiforest zone. From
5000 down the vegetation grows
scanty, and the canyon slopes are
nearly bare
