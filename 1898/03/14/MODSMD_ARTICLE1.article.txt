# ON FIELD AND TRACK.
## Stanford Athletes Strive for Records in the Annual Handicap Field-Day. 
### 
Saturday was not an ideal day
for track athletes, as those who
struggled through the events of
the Annual Handicap Field-day
will testify. The north wind blew
cold and strong, preventing fast
time in the lap events, and chilling
the men, as well as the spectators,
through and through. The need
of an athletic training-house was
never more apparent. Taking
into consideration the unfavorable
climatic conditions, the Field-day
was very encouraging, and brought
to the front some very good ma
terial in the two lower classes.
Fickert was in good form in
both the hammer throw and the
shot put, breaking the University
record of 127 feet 11 inches in, the
former by a throw of 132 feet. In
the shot put he was first over the
handicap men by a put of 38 feet
9 inches.
Morgan ran the 120-yard hurdle
in the fast time of 15 3-5, aided
by the strong wind which swept
down the stretch. As he beat the
pistol on the start the judges did
not allow the record, which would
have clipped one-tifth of a second
from his former University record.
Morgan ran the race unpaced for
the Shreve medal, and his per
formance is very creditable. Mor
gan also won the 440-yard event,
which was the prettiest race of the
day. At the crack of the pistol
the men were off and sprinted at a
teriflic pace for the first two hun
dred yards, all showing poor gen
eralship. Weakened by the sprint,
the men began to lag behind, and
Morgan won handily in 5(5 1-5
seconds, with Diggles second, and
Bauer third.
The time in the sprints was wo
fully slow, considering the liberal
handicaps and the strong wind at
the men's backs. The scratch men
were unable to score and Cantwell,
'01, took the 100 in 10 2-5 seconds
from the 44-yard mark, and the
220 in 25 seconds with seven yards
handicap. Cantwell is a strong
runner, much after the style of
Joe Bernhard, '96, and should de
velop into a reliable performer.
Diggles also showed good form, and
should develop into a point-win
ner.
Walker was not in form in the
880, having a bad knee, and the
event went to Bauer. Strout,
scratch, ran a good race, defeating
Walker.
The mile was well handicapped,
the scratch men having to do their
level best to reach the leaders. The
race was between Smith, '99,
scratch, and Arnold, '99, 85 yards,
and when the turn was reached the
men were running abreast with
equal stride. Arnold's strength
gave out near the tape, and Smith
finished strong in 4:52 2-5. Fer
rari was a good third.
Lousley in the mile walk had to
overcome a lead of 200 yards, which
he did at the rate of 50 yards a lap,
finishing strong in a remarkable
spurt of thirty yards. His time of
8:21 3-5 was very good. Wright
finished a good second.

The cold wind made good records
a surprise in the field events. The
broad jumpers all did well, the fol
lowing going over 19 feet: Whit
aker, '99, 19 ft; Symonds, '01, 19
ft $4 in; Culver, '99, 20 ft 8-J in;
Hopper, '99, 20 ft in; Dole, '98,
21 ft 24 in.
In the high jump Dole cleared
5 ft 7 in, Boyd 5 ft 0 in, Morgan
sft 6 in, and Culver sft 5 in; The
pole vault took place late in the
afternoon and the records were cor
respondingly low, Dole failing at
9 ft Gin, which Boyd cleared, win
ning out, the rest failing at 9 ft.
