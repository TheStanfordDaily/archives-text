# A 						BASEBALL VICTORY.
## Consolidated Players Lose to the Varsity for the Third Time This Season. 
### 
The Alumni team was again de
feated by the Varsity on Saturday,
the score being 10 to 8. Stanford
showed great improvement in stick
work, batting Wheeler out of the
box in the second inning and get
ting sixteen hits during the eight
innings they were at bat.
Klauber, Harris, and Lougheed
led in the batting, Klauber getting
three hits--a single, a double, and
a three-bagger; Harris a base hit
and two doubles; and Lougheed
three. Edwards lacked his usual
luck and did not succeed in touch
ing the ball during the whole game.
The fielding of the nine has
greatly improved. Up to the sev
enth inning only two errors were
made, the men playing with the
snap and ginger instilled by Coach
Sheehan. The clouds of dust that
arose after the sixth inning made
good fielding impossible, and the
last three innings were not played
in the snappy style of the first part
of the game. The men ran bases
quite well on Saturday, the effects
of Sheehan's coaching being already
noticeable.
Beckett pitched a steady game.
His improvement over hist year is
becoming more and more noticeable.
He struck out seven men, gave only
three bases, and permitted nine hits
to be made off his delivery.
The Alumni played the best ball
the team has played against Stan
ford this year. Elston caught his
usual good game. Lewis played
short in fine style.
Coach Sheehan seemed pleased
with the work of the nine. He
thinks this week will mark great
improvement in all points of the
game, especially batting and base
running.
About twenty people witnessed
the game.
