The University Field-day Satui - -
day proved conclusively that tliere
is nothing inherent in a Stanford
man to prevent him from becoming
a good track athlete. The whole
Field-day had several encouraging
features. The day was such that
the records are no criteria for
judging what the team can do un
der favorable conditions, but the
spirit of the contestants and the
number of spectators who braved
the cold and blustering weather to
witness the events show that for
mer defeats have not taken away
our enthusiasm and interest in
track events.
We do not fear defeat on the
track or in any other intercollegi
ate event so long as we go down
with our colors Hying, so long as
the team which represents us is the
best that could be mustered out of
the Stanford student body. Under
such circumstances defeat can be
borne with good grace because it is
honorable. Whenever we meel
defeat through sending a team
ag inst our opponents which dues
not represent the full strength <>112
the student body—whatever the
reason, whether lack of support or
lack of interest in the given con
test —•then we not only merit the
defeat but we also disgrace our
colors. This is the only kind of
defeat we need to fear.
The encouraging feature of the
Field-day was the strength of the
two lower classes. So long as we
place our reliance for victory on
one or two natural-born athletes,
like Morgan and Dole, will we meet
defeat on the track. The begin
ning of a successful track policy at
Stanford will be marked when a
hundred men train faithfully
throughout every track season
during their college course. Only
fifty-one men were entered for this
year's Field-day. Of these nine
were seniors, eleven juniors,
eleven sophomores, and twenty

freshmen. We are not attempting
a mathematical solution of the
problem, but at least twice as
many candidates are needed, es
pecially from the three undergrad
uate classes. More men should
come out and continue to train on
the team. We have good leaders;
the sine <{U<t turn for victory is a
larger rank and tile.
