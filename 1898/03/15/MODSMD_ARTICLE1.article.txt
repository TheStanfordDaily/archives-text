# THE
						JUNIOR ANNUAL.
## Novel and Attractive Features of the '99 Class Book, Which Is Now on the Press. 
### 
The '99 Quad has gone to press.
The book is almost complete in the
editorial department, exclusive of
the last twenty pages, which will
go to the printer next week.
The editor of the book, when
seen by a Daily Palo Alto repre
sentative this afternoon, spoke as
follows concerning the features of
the Annual: "It is rather early to
speak more than in a general way.
At present 1 can promise you the
book about Junior Day. As to
special features, some considerable
entertainment will be forthcoming.
In the way of art, we have some of
culver's best work; the artists of
tormer years, now in the Univer
sity, are well represented, and sev
eral new men of considerable .Util
ity have contributed. The art
work is, as a rule, somewhat lighter
than in former years, but this has
been one of our purposes, as we
think it will make the book more
interesting.
"In respect to the literary de
partment, I think I may safely
promise the best work yet seen in
an Annual. Our well-known
alumni writers have been very gen
erous, among those represented be
ing Carol us Ager, Edward M.
Hulme, and Miss Sarah Comstock.
The work of undergraduates is of
a very high class. Mr. Will 11.
Irwin, Wallace Irwin, Bristow
Adams, John M. Oskison, and
other writers known best by what
they have written, are well repre
sented in the pages of the Quad.
As to the lighter side of the book,
I am not prepared to say a great
deal. In fact, the more said the
worse. At any rate, the most of
that department is not yet ready
for the printer.
"It might be well to remind those
who are delinquent in the matter of
assessments that they have been
given time enough to accumulate
$2.50 and that we are in a receptive
attitude. We would like to have
the book come out without any
debt, but some members of the class
must not forget that they are under
obligations to others, and that a
small debt still exists."
