The Berkeley baseball manager
is complaining of the lack of in
terest which is being manifested by
the U. C. students in not patron
izing games which the nine plays
on the campus ami in the city. A
state of affairs exists at .Stanford
which is not exactly similar. The
bleachers are usually crowded for
match games, but during practice
spectators are few ami enthusiasm
scarce. Oui baseball players have
not seen tlii-< year such a crowd as
the least interesting practice draws
during the football season.
The support given the team by
the student body for the San Fran
cisco games has been simply a
minus quantity, and the reason for
this is not hard to Hud The great
est mistake of the season was made
when a contract was signed by the
baseball management for a sched
ule of city games with the Alumni
team. With amateur baseball de
moralized by the frequent profes
sional tournaments in the city,
there was no valid reason for play
ing city games, especially when
the students were eager for games
on the campus and were willing to
patronize liberally matches with
good nines. The Alumni-Varsity
schedule gave the nine ii chance to
pi a 3' against professionals, it is
true, hut the outlay, occasioned by
the losr.es of the games in the city,
could have brought down a pro
fessional battery for weeks at a
time. College baseball nines should
play on college diamonds, where
those who support the game may
have the opportunity of enjoying
the sport. A city schedule lends
no stimulus to general athletics in
the student body, weakens interest
in the game, and causes financial
loss.
The treasurer's report in this is
sue shows that the games in the
city have not even paid, in most
cases, the common expenses of the
two nines; in addition to which

the expenses of transportation and
the hotel hills of the team had to
he paid out of the student body
treasury. The campus games have,
on the contrary, paid well, and un
less the intercollegiate series draws
better than the preliminary games
we can hope for no good financial
results this year from baseball.
