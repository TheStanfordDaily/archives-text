sents Philolexia; J. T. Burcham,

and Miss A. L. Andrews, '99, Sat
urday Night Club.
A novel feature of this year's de
hate is that these six representa
tives will talk on the affirmative of
the question selected, each one
taking five minutes to develop some
particular phase. Then he will be
be attacked in five one-minute
speeches by members of all the
societies except his own. The ad
vantages which are claimed for this
scheme are that the affirmative
speakers will be able to work up
carefully their particular part of
the question, while the extempora

neous rebuttal will give a large
number an opportunity to take a
part on the program.
