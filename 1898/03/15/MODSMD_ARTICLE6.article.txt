# BASEBALL DISCUSSED
## P.A.A. Board Considers the Status of the Players in the Recent Alumni Series. 
### 
At the last regular meeting of
the I\ A. A. held in San Francisco
on Friday evening, March 11, the
matter about which our baseball
men have been concerned was
brought up for discussion by means
of a motion to appoint a commit
tee to investigate Manager Kees
ling's conduct in allowing the
Stanford team to compete with a
team in which professionals
played. Since playing against pro
fessional baseball teams does not
disqualify an amateur, the motion
was lost, there being nothing to
investigate. This action has the
effect of upholding Mr. Keesling.
Mr. Humphry of the registration
committee was present and raised
an bjection to the Alumni team
masquerading as an amateur or
ganization when known profession
als were played.
The matter of registering ath
letes was also brought up, and Mr.
Humphry stated that since ath
letes competing only in intercol
legiate contests did not have to reg
ister, that the football men last
year did not, and the baseball men
this year will not have to register.
Track athletes who intend to com
pete in the Pacific Coast champion
ship games must, however, be reg
istered.
