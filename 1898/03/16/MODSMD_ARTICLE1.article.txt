# MUSICALE LAST EVENING.
## Large Audience Entertained in the Chapel by the Three Visiting Musicians. 
### 
Last evening's musicale in the
chapel was by all means the best
given here thus far.
Mr. Savannah opened the pro
gram with the "Allegro Appas
sionato" from Grieg's Sonata.
He is a clever violinist, and showed
that breadth of tone which so few
players have the good fortune to
possess, and which nearly always
brings with it a depth of feeling
without which the performer is a
mere trickster, and not a violinist
in the true sense of the word. His
interpretation of the "Suite" by
Franz Reis is especially noteworthy,
and leaves no room for doubt that
the praises he has received for a tine
technique are certainly well de
served. As an encore to the
"Suite" Mr. Savannah gave the
"Legende" of Wieniawski, which
he played with the richness and
fullness of tone so essential in this
composition.
Miss Griffin is certainly a splen
did accompanist. This was es
pecially noticeable in Reis' "Suite"
and Ernest Lent's trio. Her in
terpretation of the "Minuet" by
Louis Ree received a hearty wel
come.
To Mr. Lent we are greatly in
debted for a rare treat. He IB a
great artist. His tone alone, to say
nothing of his other good qualities,
is superb. The "Triiumerei" by
Schumann, which he played as an
encore to Chopin's "Nocturne," was
given with a feeling and a finish
that an artist of the first rank alone
can produce. Mr. Lent is also a
composer of rare merit. His "Trio"
is a grand composition, especially
the second movement, which, while
extremely difficult, was well ex
ecuted, and in its dramatic parts
reminded one greatly of Rubin
stein.
Miss Griffin and Mr. Savannah
are the guests of the Delta Upsilon
fraternity, and together with Mr.
Lent entertained the members with
several more well chosen selections.
