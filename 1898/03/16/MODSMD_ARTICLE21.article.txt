# On the Track.
## 
### 
The dual meet between the Fresh
men and the Oakland High School,
which comes off on Saturday, March
'26, will be enlivened by an open
hundred yard race, an open ham
mer throw in which Fickert and
Plant will tilt at Edgren's Coast
record, and possibly by some other
open event.
Word has been received from the
manager of the Universityof Nevada
track team that they will meet our
Freshmen on track and field. A date
for the meet has not been selected
as yet. The team will be picked
after the O. H. S. meet on the 26th.
