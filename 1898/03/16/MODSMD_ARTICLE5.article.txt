# Excursion to Pacific Grove.
## 
### 
There will be excursions to Santa
Cruz and Pacific Grove on March
25 and 26. A special rate of three
dollars for the round-trip to either
resort has been secured, and the
tickets will be good returning until
April 10.
Last year about fifty persons
took advantage of the low rates
and it is probable that even more
will go this year. Both resorts
abound in attractions and are very
pleasant at this time of the year.
For further information apply to
J. E. McDowell at the Registrar's
