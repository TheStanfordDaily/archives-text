will speak in the chapel next Sun
day, both morning and evening.
He will arrive Friday from Cleve

There were 1717 student delegates
present from 458 institutions.
Mr. Lewis is en route to China
for work among the students at
Shanghai. He is Stanford's repre

and the Cleveland convention, and
in the evening more especially upon
the Chinese work.
