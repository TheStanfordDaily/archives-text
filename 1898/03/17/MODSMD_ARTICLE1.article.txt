# THE
						NEW REGISTER.
## Changes Which Are Noted in University Regulations, Courses, and Faculty Lists. 
### 
The final proofs of the University
Register for 1897-98 are now being
read. A few copies will probably
be received during the coming mid
semester recess, and the Register
will be ready for general distribu
tion by the time the University re
assembles, the 4th of April.
The new Register does not es
sentially differ in form and matter
from preceding Registers. There
will be about 180 pages, on a little
better paper than usual. The new
names in the faculty list are Wald
emar Lindgren, Associate Professor
of Mining and Metallurgy; Oliver
M. Johnston, Assistant Professor of
Romanic Languages; Clyde A.
Duniway, Assistant Professor of
History; Geo. J. Peirce, Assistant
Professor of Botany; E. Dana Du
rand, Assistant Professor of Fi
nance; Ell wood P. Cubberley,Assist
ant Professor of Education; Miss
Z. \V\ Fiske, Mr. E. L. Parsons, C
B. Whittier, and Miss E. B. Pear
son, instructors; and a number of
assistants. Assistant Professor
Price has been promoted to the
rank of Associate Professor of Zo
ology. Mr. Harrold Heath, who
has been Fellow in Zoology in the
University of Pennsylvania for the
last two years, will return next
year as Assistant Professor of Zo
ology. Messrs Schmidt, Wilbur,
Snyder, and Storey, and Miss
Stoltenberg have been promoted
from assistants to instructors.
The Library statistics show
38,000 volumes and 18,000 pam
phlets — an increase of 3,000
volumes and 3,000 pamphlets over
the preceding year.
Under "Conditions of Admission"
several important modifications are
noted. English la is no longer re
quired, but is made optional, leav
ing English Composition as the
prescribed requirement for admis
sion. Several changes in specific
subjects are announced to go into
effect after 1898. The requirements
in English la and 16 have been en
tirely remodelled, and after 1898
these subjects will be accepted at the
University only on examination.
The work outlined in Physics has
not been changed, but after 1898 the
approved note-books will waive
examinations only in the labora
tory work; the student offering
Physics will be examined on the
text at the University. Greek and
Roman History has been replaced
by Ancient History, and a brief
outline of the Oriental nations is
added to the previous requirements
in this subject. More important is
the fact that after 1898 students
offering any one of the histories,
whether on certificate or examina
tion, must submit note books duly
certified by their teachers. This
change is likely to have a whole
some effect upon the teaching of
history in preparatory schools. A
careful and detailed statement re
garding these note-books is being
prepared by the department of His
tory and will be sent to teachers
and others desiring it.
It is also Hiinounced for the first
time in the Register that examina

tions .passed at other universities
may he offered in place of recom
mendations from approved schools,
provided a sufficient number of ex
aminations have been passed to se
cure admission to the university
from which they are offered. The
requirements for admission of
special students have been raised
in two particulars —the minimum
age has been made 21 instead of
20, and special students must have
an educational equipment substan
tially equivalent to that of first
year students, or else must he able
to do advanced work in some line.
Under "University Regulations"
an important change is noted re
garding the granting of advanced
standing on extra entrance sub
jects It is that the subject for
which advanced credit is asked
must be successfully continued in
the University within two years
after matriculation. The following
statement also appears under the
head of ''Admission and Advanced
Standing": "Applications for ad
vanced standing on the basis of
work done before entering the Uni
versity must be filed within one
semester after matriculation; and
such applications will not be re
ceived at a later date." The new
regulation of the Council regarding
credit for special outside courses,
not taken in the regular summer
schools, are stated on page 40. On
page 48 the Faculty Committee on
Student Aid has made an ex
tended statement regarding oppor
tunities and c nditions of self-sup
port at the University.
Under "Courses of Instruction"
it will be noted that Greek and
Latin as departmental divisions
have been grouped together
under Classical Languages, Greek
and Latin being subdivisions of
the general subject. The depart
ment of Ethics disappears entirely,
the work being in the main trans
ferred to the department of Educa
tion, of which Professor Griggs
now becomes head. This depart
ment has been entirely remodelled
and the number of courses largely
increased. The requirements for
high school certificates have also
been restated. The department of
Economics and Sociology has also
been rearranged, and the courses
are numbered consecutively under
the general head. There are the
usual omission of courses and ad
dition of others; but for these de
tails the reader is referred to the
Register itself.
The new Teachers' Bureau of In
formation is noted on the fourth
page of the cover.
Perhaps the most interesting
part of the Register is the Uni
versity statistics, showing an in
crease over last year of 132. Tin
detailed comparison is as follows:
