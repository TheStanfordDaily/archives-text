The Junior Hop Committee held
a meeting today for preliminary
organization and decided to give
the Prom, upon April 22, the day
before the Intercollegiate Field-day
and the Intercollegiate Debate. If
this action i* final, the choice of
the committee is open to criticism
for several reasons. The Prom,
has usually been held after the
field-day and the debate in order
to give our athletes an opportunity
to attend. The evening before two
of our most important intercollegi
ate events is not suited for an even
ing of social pleasure. Last year
Junior Day was April 30, and the
Prom, took place in the evening.
The field-day had taken place a
week before.
It has been the custom also for
the Junior Annual to appear on
Junior Day. The Annual thih
year can not possibly appear be
fore May 1, and the advantage of
its appearance on a day devoted to
the Junior Class can readily he
seen. It is to he Imped that some
more satisfactory date can he se
lected.
