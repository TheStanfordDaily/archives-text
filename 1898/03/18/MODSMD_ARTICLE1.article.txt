# ANOTHER DEFEAT.
## Varsity Errors and Santa Clara Hitting Lost the Third Game to the College. 
### 
The Varsity gave a wretched ex
hibition of baseball yesterday af
ternoon at San .Jose, being beaten
by Santa Clara by a score of 14 to
0. Stanford was outplayed in
every department of the game.
Santa Clara found Lanagan's de
livery for thirteen safe hits, eight
of which were bunts. The Varsity
was unable to locate Kelly's
curves, placing the ball safely only
five times.
Santa Clara commenced the run
getting in tiie first inning: a base
on balls, a wild pitch, and two
bunts enabling Graham and
Leake to cross the plate. In the
second inning three runs were
scored, two of them on account of
Wight's inability to grasp a high
tfy in short center. In the next
inning Kelly bunted, stole second,
and was advanced to third on
Farry's sacrifice. Connor hit to
Lanagan, who threw to Murphy,
catching Kelly between third and
the plate, Connor making the cir
cuit to third while Kelly was being
put out. Counahan's safe drive to
left brought Connor in. Robinson
scored in the fourth on a base on
balls, a wild pitch, and Graham's
hit. Farry led off in the next in
ning with a clean two-bagger to
left, and was brought in by a
single by Connor. Connor then
stole second and third, and scored
on Robinson's slow grounder to
first. In the sixth two runs re
sulted, on errors by Harris and
Chandler: a hit, and a stolen base.
In the ninth inning, with one out,
Robinson bunted; Taber followed
suit; both stole a base, and scored
on Lougheed's wild throw of
Graham's grounder, Graham going
to second on the play, and scoring
on Murphy's error and a wild
pitch.
Stanford scored first in the
fourth inning. Harris got his base
on balls Klauber hit to short,
Garnot muffing in the attempt to
put out Harris. Chandler ad
vanced each a base by getting tirst
on called balls. Lanagan hit to
Kelly, who lielded Harris out at
the plate. Klauber and Chandler
scored on Connor's errors. In the
seventh inning, by the aid of a
diminutive negro mascot with a
Varsity sweater, four additional
runs were made. Wight got a
base on balls; Young hit to Kelly,
who threw wild in the attempt to
get Wight out at second. Strohn
was presented with first, filling the
base-. Wight and Young scored
on Counahan's muff of Harris' fly..
Kiauber's safe hit brought in:
Strohn. Harris scored the last run
for Stanford on Leake's fumble.
Of Stanford's playing, the less
said the better. The large error
column and the small number of
hits bear witness to the quality of
game played. Strohn 'caught an |
excellent game. Lanagan was very
wild throughout the game, giving!
his catcher many opportunities of
making star stops. Stanford was
very deficient in base-running.
Scarcely any bases were stolen, and
the watchful Kelly managed to

catch two or three base-runners
napping.
For Santa Clara, Robinson, Ta
ber. and Graham led in the batt ing.
In holding Santa Clara was not
particularly brilliant. (Jarnot ac
cepted many dillicult chances, not
ably Young's low drive over second
in the third inning, on which a
double play was made. -Graham
caught a good game.
Between three and four thousand
persons witnessed the game.
