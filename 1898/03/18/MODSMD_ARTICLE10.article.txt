All through the present season
competent, critics and students fa
miliar with the athletic history of
Stanford have commented upon
the lack of spirit and lethargy of the
baseball men. It. is an open ques
tion whether the Varsity has
played in better form this season
than in the first Alumni game,
which the team played with little
or no practice. Up to this time
we have been accustomed to make
excuses for the character of the
play on account of the early stage
of the season. Students good
naturedly attributed it to "slump"
and like expressions, which con
cretely explain poor and lifeless
play. Student body pessimists,
after yesterday's game, are begin
ning to wonder whether baseball
at Stanford is on a perpetual de
cline without hope for improve
ment. The team is composed of
strong individual players, and will
merit the confidence of the student
body, if it will only get together
and play ball. The student body
will give its support; we look to
the players for the rest.
