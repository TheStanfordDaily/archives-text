# Sheehan Discusses the Game.
## 
### 
Coach Sheehan was interviewed
today 011 the poor showing made by
the Varsity in San Jose yesterday.
Hesaid: "The game was lost by er
rors made by individuals at criti
cal times, and the inability of the
men to come up to the plate and
'smash the ball out for a hit when
they had men on bases —a crying
want in better work at the bat.
However, the greatest fault is the
lack of knowing what to do with
the ball the instant a player re
ceives it. Not once, but. a dozen
times yesterday did this fault shine
out glaringly.
"All this comes from a lack of
interest in the game on the part of
the players. They do not use their
brains. Every time a ball is
pitched a player must take in the
situation, and think to himself
what he would do with the ball if
it were hit to him. This the Var
sity does not do. You can see
how important a point it is, and
what the consequences will be if
they do not learn it.
" The team work yesterday, as a
whole, was good; everybody backed
up weil and watched signals, but
they did not put an ounce of
ginger or snap into their play.
Every man was as quiet as a man
lishing trout Lack! Lack! 1 tell
you, an absolute lack of anything
that looked like snap or ginger.
"We shall have good practice for
a week. We have arranged to have
a team of old professional players
comedown here for three or four
games These men know the game
and know it thoroughly, and it. is
hoped that the Varsity will reap
benefit by seeing and by playing
against them.
"1 tell you what an old-timer
notices on the baseball field here at
the practice every night, and that
is the absence of the old familiar
knot of rooters. 1 would like to
see more spectators at the practice."
