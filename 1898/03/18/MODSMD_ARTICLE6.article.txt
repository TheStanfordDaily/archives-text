# Mr. Gailey Instead of Mr. Lewis.

### 
A telegram received from John
R. Mott, chairman of the inter
national committee of the Young
Men's Christian Association, states
that it will be impossible for Mr.
Robert F. Lewis to speak in the
chapel Sunday. In his place Mr.
Robert R. Gailey, the famous
Princeton athlete, will speak, and
Mr. Lewis will probably be here on
Tuesday.
