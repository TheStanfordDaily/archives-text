# VARSITY VICTORIOUS.
## Game With Gun Club Won by "Ginger" and Good Battery Work With a Score of 4 to 1. 
### 
The Varsity recovered somewhat
from its slump by defeating the
Garden City Gun Club on Satur
day by a score of 4 to 1. The
feature of the game was Beckett's
pitching. He had excellent con
trol and more speed than at any
time this season. He retired thir
teen of the visitors to the bench,
and allowed but two hits and two
bases on balls throughout the nine
innings. Swindells was in better
form than at any game he has
caught this year. He did not have
a passed ball, made a couple of
phenomenal stops of what appeared
to be wild pitches, and steadied
Beckett at critical moments.
Stanford made her first run in
the third inning. Edwards got a
hit along the third-base line, and
stole second. Crandall fanned,
and Lougheed got first on balls.
Murphy hit to pitcher, who threw
to third to force Edwards. A muff
by Arguello permitted Edwards
and Lougheed to cross the plate.
Umpire Erb ruled Edwards out at
third or) the ground that the ball
was held long enough by the base
man. In the next Wight led off
with a single, stole second, went to
third on an overthrow, and came
in on Young's three-bagger to right,
Young being retired in trying to
make the plate on the hit. Klauber
got to second on Doyle's muff and
scored on Beckett's hit. In the
eighth, with oneout,Murphy bunted,
went to second on Wight's neat sac
rifice, and scored on two wild
pitches. The Gun Club was shut
out until the last inning. Druge
vich got a base on balls, stole sec
ond and tallied on Foley's single
to right.
Owing to the excellent battery
work, Stanford fielders had few
chances, so that there was little
opportunity to make errors. How
ever, an improvement was noted
over previous games. Young still
had his eye on the ball. Klauber
held down third better than any
one else on that corner this year.
The Varsity showed a disposition
for quick work. In the -natter of
base running Stanford shows as
poorly as ever. Doyle's way of
watching the bases, and Bray's
speedy right arm, nipped many a
stolen base in the bud. Doyle
seemed able to puzzle the Stanford
batters, only two bits being ob
tained in the four innings he was
in the box. Doyle, Bray, and Car
rera did the best work for the
visitors.
The score:
GUN CLUB.
