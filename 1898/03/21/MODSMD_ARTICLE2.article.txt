Fickert, '98, W. H. Irwin, '98, and
O C. Leiter,'99, visited Mrs. Stan
ford Saturday morning and pre
sented her with the resolutions
passed by the Encina Club, thank
ing her for the gift of the club-room.
Mrs. Stanford expressed her ap
preciation of the resolutions to the
committee, and spoke very pleas
antly of her plans for the Hall and
for the University. The failure of
the Encina dining room has al
ways been a source of regret to the
Founders, and in the new plan of
building a restaurant on the
grounds and turning the dining
room into a recreation-room for
the Encina men, Mrs. Stanford
thinks the solution to the problem
has been found. Mrs. Stanford
also stated that only $500,000 of
the legacies of Senator Stanford re
mained unpaid, and that the re
maining legatees had signed a pe
tition for her relef.se from the
probate court. As soon as Mrs.
Stanford is out of the control of the
probate court work on the
buildings will be resumed. Work
on the Assembly Hall and the Li
brary building will be begun as
soon as possible, probably in the
summer. Plans are now being
prepared by Architect Hodges.
The Library building is to be 7<)x
190, and will be a very beautiful
structure, two stories high, situated
in front of the present Library
building.
