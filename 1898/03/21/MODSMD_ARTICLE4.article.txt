# GOVERNOR HASTINGS.
## Pennsylvania's Executive Addressed Students in the Chapel This Afternoon. 
### 
Governor Daniel H. Hastings of
Pennsylvania spoke in the chapel
this afternoon. Professor J. M.
Stillman introduced the dis
tinguished visitor, who spoke in
part as follows:
"I thank you for such a pleasant
and enthusiastic welcome. 1 am
free to say that I don't feel at all
like a stranger among you. 1 had
the distinguished honor of know
ing your great founder.
"You know that the governor of
Pennsylvania is the ex-officio pres
ident of the State university, and
we have in our university at home
a student by the name of Brooke,'
who, 1 know, taught you some!
tricks for your benefit when you j
went against the football team j
from Berkeley last fall.
"1 hardly know where my sym
pathies iie, for we have in our
party the mother and sisier of
Captain Cochran of Princeton Uni
versity, who is working hard at
Berkeley, and all 1 can say is that
you had better look out for Cap
tain Cochran and his men.
"You have here in California a
great climate, a great atmosphere,
great horses, and great men. There
is a good deal of waste country be
tween here and Pennsylvania where
some of your surplus climate could
be used to advantage.''
Speaking of the crowded condi
tions of life today, and the oppor
tunities for men to find their place,
he said: "Many of you will succeed
and I am sorry to say many will
also fail, but the opportunities for
you in thin great State are many
and ought to be seized by you."
Governor Hastings spoke of the
life of Senator Stanford, his aim
and purpose in founding the Uni
versity, and hoped that ihe mem
ory of his name would last as long
as our great State.
"It should be a pride and a satis
faction for you to know that the
founder of this institution contrib
uted more in time and money and
property in the past, present, and
future toward material advance
ment than any one else in this
great country."
"Don't be alarmed about going to
war with Spain. There is no im
mediate apprehension of war. We
are too big to go to war with Spain
and too much of a Christian nation
to go to battle if there is an oppor
tunity to settle the question in
any other way. But if we do, I be
lieve you will find men to meet the
emergency whatever that may be.
The thought I will leave with
you is, prepare yourself for what
ever emergency may come upon
you, find out what you are good
for and then stay with it."
After speaking of the various
crises in our national history and
the men who arise to meet them, he
closed by saying: "Prepare your
self for the emergencies that may
come to you. There is no place in
the world with such opportunities
as we have here in our country.
Make the best of them."
Speaking of the sacrifices of
women, the Governor referred to
the late Frances E. Willard and

also to the devotion of Mrs. Stan
ford to the University and to the
wishes of her husband.
"Now I have finished my little
talk" said he,"I hope that the
time may soon come when this
great institution will he the realiza
tion of the dr<tam of Senator Stan
ford and become the rival of Ox
ford, Yale, Harvard, or even of the
University of Pennsylvania."
