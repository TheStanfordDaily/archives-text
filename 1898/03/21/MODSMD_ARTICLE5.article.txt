# Tuesday Evening Lecture.
## 
### 
The regular Tuesday evening lec
ture will be given by Mr. Chester
Bailey Fernald, best known to the
people on this Coast as the author
of the story dramatized by Francis
A. Powers under the name of The
First Born. This play, which deals
with various phases of Chinese life,
was first produced in San Francisco
last summer. After a phenomenal
run in that city it was taken to
New York, and is now having a
continuous winter run in opposi
tion to its rival, The Cat and
Cherub, which is Mr. Fernald'sown
dramatizing of the same story.
Mr. Fernald is personally inter
ested in Stanford, having at one
time prepared to enter. He turned
his attention instead to literary
work, and his success in that line
has prevented him from carrying
out his former plan.
The title of. Mr. Fernald's lec
ture is ''Experiences of 'The Cat
and Cherub' in London."
