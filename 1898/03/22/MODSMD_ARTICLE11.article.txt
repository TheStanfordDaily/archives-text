Whilk track and diamond daily
give evidence if our activity in the
line of athletics, it should not be
forgotten that our representatives
for lhe Intercollegiate Debate are
working just as steadily and just
as faithfully to achieve a victory
which is still more important than
supremacy in any track athletics.
The inter-society debates should
draw out as large crowds as base
ball games or track contests, for it
is only by the encouragement of
undeveloped material that we may
hope for victory in the future.
