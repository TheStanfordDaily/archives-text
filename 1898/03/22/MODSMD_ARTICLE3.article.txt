an address upon the nature and
importance of Christian work
among the students of China. He
outlined the educational system of
China, emphasizing the high
standard, and the great power

J which students wield there. Stu
dents who receive the highest de
! gree are qualified thereby to hold
| government positions, and they are
j the rulers of China. They are the
conservatives, and they oppose
I every innovation. He then pointed
out that it is the object of the
Y. M. C. A. movement which he
and Mr. Lewis represent to attack
China at this strategic point, and
to Christianize the Chinese em
