# FIELD-DAY SATURDAY.
## The 						Freshman Team Will Meet the Oakland High School Athletes on Path and Field. 
### 
On Saturday, March 26, our
Freshmen meet the athletes of the
Oakland High School on track and
field.
The meet promises to be inter
esting from more than one point of
view; for besides affording our new
men much needed experience, an
opportunity will be given for judg
ing the ability of some of the men
who are counted on for places in
the intercollegiate field-day. In
addition to the regular events there
will be an open pole vault, and a
dual hammer throw between Plaw,
formerly of the O. 11. S. but now of
Boone's Academy, and Fickert, '98.
Both men have thrown over 130
feet and it is not at all improbable
that the Coast record now held by
Edgren will be shattered.
The Freshmen have been hard at
work for the past few weeks and
are determined to win.
