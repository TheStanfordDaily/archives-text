# FACULTY CHANGES.
## Professors Who Leave and Those Who Return to the University Next Semester. 
### 
A large number of the faculty
will be absent from the University
during the next college year.
Professor and Mrs. Ross will
leave here on May 20. The month
of June will be spent in visiting
Washington, Mrs. Ross's former
home, and in short visits with Dr.
Ross's co-workers in Economics and
Sociology at the Universities of
Wisconsin, Chicago, Harvard, Y'aie,
Columbia, Princeton, Pennsylvania,
and Johns Hopkins. On July 9
they will take passage, in company
with Professor and Mrs. Hudson,
for London, where Dr. Ross will
spend six months working in the
Library of the British Museum.
His work there will consist princi
pally in developing the series of ar
ticles which has been published in
the Journal of Sociology, into a
book. January will see them on
the continent, where Mrs. Ross will
pursue her art studies and Dr.
Ross will make special observation
on recent tendencies in literature.
This study looks toward a second
book on latter-day pessimism. In
this will be incorporated essays on
"The way into pessimism," "The
way out," "The contemporary
mood," and "Turning towards
Nirvana": grouped under the title
of the latter. They plan to give
Paris six weeks and Italy and
Sicily three months and a half.
They will return by way of the
Rhine, taking the steamer for home
at Amsterdam.
Professor and Mrs. Hudson will
accompany Dr. and Mrs Ross to
London, Professor Hudson's former
home. There, with the exception
of time taken for visits to Oxford
and Bristol, they will be engaged
in literary work at the great Library
until Christmas. By that time
Professor Hudson hopes to have
finished the second of the "Idle
Hours" series, to have gotten out
an edition each of Johnson and
Rossetti, and to have finished his
book on Tennyson, already begun.
Their tour on the continent is to
include France, Italy, Switzerland,
Germany, Belgium, Holland, and
if possible, Denmark. On the con
tinent Professor Hudson will study
contemporary literature, that of
France and Italy especially. As a
result, we can expect the future to
give us a series of studies in modern
continental literature, among them
essays on Tolstoi, ibsen, and
Renan.
Owing to the uncertainty which
exists as to the date of his depart
ure, Professor Griggs hesitates to
outline plans more definitely than
as follows: "I shall go first to the
British Museum, where I shall
spend considerable time in liter
ary work. My continental trip
will give me further material for
the expansion of writings already
outlined. In Paris and Italy, as
well as in London, a certain mar
gin of time will be available for
the study of art, which, indeed,
one may study almost anywhere
and at any time if he has the de
sire."
Professor C. D. Marx, in com
pany with Professor Smith, will

spend the summer in a tour of Eu
rope, inspecting works on rivers,
harbor improvements, and general
hydraulic works of all kinds. |
They will visit Bremen, Hamburg,
Berlin, Hanover, and Cologne, go-;
ing up the Rhine as far as May
enz, inspecting river improvements.
They will return to Brussels to at
tend the Seventh International
Congress of Internal Navigation,
which is to be held in that city in
July. After inspecting public
works in Belgium, they will re
turn homeward, presumably
Lb rough England and Scotland, if
the time permits; otherwise, they
will sail direct for New York from
Antwerp.
Professor Abbott will spend the
summer in England, studying in
London and Oxford, returning in
time for the opening of the Uni
versity in September.
Professor A. B. Clark will spend
the summer and fall of his year's
leave of absence from the Art de
partment in study at New York
City. The winter and spring time
will be spent in the same way at
Paris. Professor B. C. Brown, the
head of the department, will com
plete his studies in Paris, where he
has been for the past year in time,
to take charge of the department
next September.
Professor O. M. Johnston expects
to spend the summer in Paris, Bail
ing from New York about June.
He will devote the greater part of
his time to work in the Bibliotheque
Nationale on historical Italian
grammar. He has already spent
three or four years in research upon
this subject and will publish a
book on it. Besides his study in
the national library, he will attend
the Alliance Francaise, which is a
summer school under the direction
of instructors from the leading
Paris universities and colleges, and
is conducted for the benefit of in
structors in foreign institutions.
Professor Johnston will return for
the opening of the University next
fall.
Professor J. E. Matzke will re
turn to the University before the
beginning of next semester. He is
at present in Paris, where he it
studying in the Ecole des Hautes
Etudes, a collection of seminaries,
under Gaston Paris, the great
French philologist. He is also at
work on phonetics under l'Abbe
Rourselot, the inventor of phonet
ical apparatus, this work being
done in the private laboratories of
Rourselot. He is also studying
French dialects under Gillieron,
and popular Latin under A.
Thomas. In addition to these
studies, Professor Matze is making
investigations relative to the old
French laws of William the Con
queror, the results of which he in
tends to publish.
Dr. K. G. Rendtorff will sail from
New York for Hamburg in May.
He will visit bis old home at Kiel
University, and will spend some
time copying old manuscripts in
the libraries of Prague, Bohemia,
and Basil, Switzerland, returning
by way of Italy and Gibraltar in
time for the beginning of work at
the University next semester.
Professor Still mall has not made
definite plans. He, with his fam

ily, will spend at least the first se
mester away from the University
in search of recreation and health.
Dr. Howard has spent the win
ter in Lincoln, Nebraska, where
he has been finishing up his new
book, "The History of Marriage,"
which will be published some time
this summer. This new work by
Dr. Howard is a complete treatise
on the history of marriage from
earliest times down to the present
day. Professor Howard and Mrs.
Howard will spend the summer in
the West, and will return to Stan
ford a short time before the Uni
versity opens.
Instructor Fanner has been
granted a leave of absence for one
year, part of which he will
spend in Paris studying electrical
engineering, probably at the Ecole
des Hautes Etudes. He will leave
right after the close of the Univer
sity, but will return to take up his
