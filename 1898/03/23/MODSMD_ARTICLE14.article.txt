# Junior Prom.
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Junior Prom,
committee this afternoon, it was â– 
decided to change the date of the I
Prom, the twenty-second to i
the twenty-ninth of April. This
was done to accommodate the track j
men. A large number of them J
have signified their intention to ni-f
tend the dance in case it should j
not interfere with their training,
rules.
