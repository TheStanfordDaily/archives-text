# MR. FERNALD'S LECTURE.
## A 						Large Audience Entertained Last Evening by the Talented Young Writer. 
### 
In view of the impending ex
aminations and the prevalence of
la grippe, it was a flatteringly large
audience that greeted Mr. Chester
Bailey Fernald in the chapel last
night. Mr. Fernald is a young
man exceptionally gifted as a short
story writer, as his success in his
"The Cat and the Cherub" and'' The
First Born" will testify. These two
stories dealing with child life in
the San Francisco Chinatown have
been dramatized and have been de
cided successes on the stage.
In the introductory remarks Mr.
Fernald told of his laughable ex
periences as playwright and stage
manager, and gave valuable hints
as to success in the lines of story
writer and dramatist. The read
ings that followed were delightful
and gave glimpses of the writer's
powers in lines aside from his
well-known Chinatown stories, and
showed a wonderful versatility.
The "Parlous Wholeness of
Ephraim," with its account of
the 1400 ailments and the New
England wedding, caused much
merriment. Then followed the story
relating the exploits of "O'Shea,
U. S. N.," which was continually
interrupted by applause of partic
ularly witty passages. This story
is really one of the most genuinely
humorous productions of the whole
gamut of modern short story
writers.
