# PROGRESS OF THE TEAM.
## Coach Sheehan Discusses the Play of the Nine and the Plans For the Vacation. 
### 
"Coach" Sheehan was inter
viewed today on the recent im
provement shown by the baseball
team and on his plans for the va
cation. lie said: "In the last week
the play has picked up a good
deal. The players are running
bases and fielding better, but their,
batting does not improve. The
great trouble is that the men are
not in the proper physical condi
tion. They are not training, and,
as a consequence, when they appear
on the Held in the afternoon, lack
of vim and dash is evident. From
now on the men have promised to
train, and I feel confident that
their game wili improve.
"There will be a game with some
outside team tomorrow afternoon
on the campus. Lanagan will
pitch in this game, and Beckett in
the game with Santa Clara in San
Jose on Saturday.
"During the vacation we shall
play two games off the campus be
sides the regular practice games
every afternoon. On Wednesday
the Varsity will play the Santa
Cruz team at Santa Cruz and on
Friday afternoon the team leaves
for Reno to play the University of
Nevada. We shall arrive in Iieno
Saturday morning, play the game
in the afternoon, and leave late that
night, arriving at Stanford Sunday
afternoon. The game at Reno
ought to be an easy victory for the
Varsity.
"I would like to say a few words
of praise for the second team. They
are playing a good all-round
game."
