The University has been placed
in a most undignified position by
tbe absolutely nonsensical course
of action pursued by the Kresbtnan
Class, acting through its elected of
ficers. 111 the first place, a-challenge
for a baseball contest was sent by
the Freshman president, entirely
unauthorized by the class, couched
in language at least several hun
dred per cent, below the 11> level.
Then, after this challenge had been
refused and had also been tiled
away in the Berkeley archives as a
specimen of Stanford English "as
she is writ," the Freshmen seized
upon a vague rumor and accepted
a challenge from the U. C. fresh
men before it had ever been ten
dered. Wither the representative
men and women of the Freshman
Class should step in and bring
about a "Lexovv" investigation, or
else a protectorate should be estab
lished by the upper classes over the
offenders. Something surely needs
to be done.
