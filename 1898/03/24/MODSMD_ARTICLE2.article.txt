# That Freshman Debate.
## 
### 
Considerable antagonism has
been aroused among upper class
men to the action of the Freshman
Class in accepting a challenge for
an intercollegiate freshman debate,
providing one is sent by the Berke
ley freshmen. A meeting of the
executive committee of the Inter-
Society Debating League has been
called for tomorrow, and a straw
ballot of the members makes it
almost certain that some unfavor
able action will be taken.
Following are interviews which
fully represent the sentiment of the
student body in the matter:
E. H. Rothrock, '98, president of
the Inter-Society Debating League,
gave his opinion as follows: "1 am
not opposed to this Freshman De
bate on the grounds that our Fresh
men are not able to defeat Berkeley
nor because 1 believe in centraliz
ing our debating interests in the
Intercollegiate Debate. I am
heartily in favor of a lower class
debating contest with Berkeley and
believe that the establishment of
such a contest for the first semester
of the sophomore year would be
advantageous to Stanford. We are,
however, without a special depart
ment in debating, and it might be
well to await the establishment of
one before multiplying our debat
ing contests."
A. 11. Suzzallo, '00, one of Stan
ford's representatives on this year's
Oarnot team, said: "I think that
the action taken by the Freshman

Class was a little hasty, and they
should have given the question
more consideration than they did.
Especially, since Stanford's inter
collegiate policy should be such as
to concentrate interest in the Inter
collegiate Debate. In the past, in
terest in debating has been a great
deal less than in athletics, and to
inaugurate so many intercollegiate
debating events would perhaps de
crease interest in the main de
bating event."
F. S. Fisher, '98, Varsity foot
ball captain, expressed himself as
follows: "All of our intercollegi
ate contests should be well at
tended by the students in order to
encourage the contestants, but we
are getting to have so many con
tests that the majority of students
can not afford to go to the city
every time. The student body is
worked up all the time over the lit
tle events, and when a big contest
conies off it is no wonder that the
editors of the Daily Palo Alto
complain of a lack of enthusiasm.
For this reason I object to
the addition of any more minor
intercollegiate contests, since the
number is already large enough."
