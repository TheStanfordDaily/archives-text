# "Leo XIII in the Vatican."
## 
### 
The name of F. Marion Craw
ford is known wherever good liter
ature is found. No American au
thor of the present day has a
higher place in the affectionate re
gard of the people than this dis
tinguished scholar. The announce
ment of Mr. Crawford's forthcom
ing lecture at Stanford upon a
topic with which he is more in
timately familiar than any speaker
of this or any other country will be
of especial interest. A Catholic him
self, Mr. Crawford has studied his
theme for love of it, and extra
ordinary facilities for pursuing his
researches have been accorded him.
He is thoroughly informed con
cerning the domestic life of the
Vatican and the personality of the
Pope. The Catholic Neivs (New
York) of recent date says, in part:
"The lecturer aroue, a man of
striking presence, and for nearly
two hours held the audience al
most breathless. His picture of
Leo XIII was original, complete,
powerful, and vivid. He presented
the claim of the temporal power
most clearly and vividly, and the
reason of the captivity, or virtual
imprisonment, of the Pope in the
Vatican,with unquestionable force."
The Tribune says:"It is a most
instructive and delightful dis
course, and, in its social bearing,
one of the most important utter
ances that have been heard from
the platform in many a day. Mr.
Crawford's delivery, backed by
manliness of character, deep sin
cerity of feeling, and intrinsic dig
nity and earnestness of mind, is
easy, graceful, colloquial, and
steadily effective.''
Mr. Crawford will give this fa
mous lecture at Stanford Friday
evening, April 8.
