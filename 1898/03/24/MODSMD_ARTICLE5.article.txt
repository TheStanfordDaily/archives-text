# FRESHMEN ON THE TRACK.
## Men Who Will Represent Their Class in Saturday's Meet With the Oakland High. 
### 
The meet on next Saturday be
tween the Freshman track athletes
ami the team from the Oakland
High will he very interesting with
close contests, and it is impossible
to say which team will he victorious
until it is over.
The Freshmen are especially
strong in the distance runs and in
the walk, and from all that is
known of the High School team it
seems as if the Freshmen should
get all the places in those three
races.
In the sprints the High School
hoys have a wonder in the graceful
little "natchel-born" athlete, Cado
gan, who is remembered at Stan
ford for the quarter he ran here in
the meet last year between '00 and
the Oakland High. The Fresh
men will put up against him in
various events Cantwell, Stewart,
Svinonds, Strout, Boroughs, and
Davidson, some of whom are cap
able of making him exert himself
to win.
In the pole vault both teams
have men capable of doing 10
feet. Foster and Moeller are the
Freshmen who will contest. Jn the
high jump Bennett and Boroughs
are about evenly matched and
about equal to the best High
School man. In the broad jump
it is probable that the Freshmen
will be outclassed, as it is under
stood that Oakland has a jumper
good for 21 feet.
Nothing can be said definitely
about the chances of '01 in the
weights, as the Freshman manager
has failed to secure either a 12-
pound hammer or a 12-pound shot.
Hill, Emerson, Wardall, and
Swett will contest There will be
an open 16-pound hammer throw,
in which Fickert and Plaw, who
won the 12-pound hammer throw
last year, will strive for suprem
acy.
The Freshmen have no experi
enced men in the hurdles. Craig
has an ideal build for a high
hurdler, and with training is going
to be a record h >lder, but he has
been at the hurdles only a short
time. Spaulding will also enter
the high hurdles. Dole will run
the 220-yard race, and Strout may
enter.
The Freshmen are strong in the
bicycle event.
