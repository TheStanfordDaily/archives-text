Thk complaint about tlie class of
ball that is being put up by the
niiit' has become general. 1'be
University public knows from wbat
it ban seen of the baseball men in
the past that they have good ball
in them, but the question is,''What
is the matter?" It can not be
doubted that the team is not get
ting the strongest sunport from
those whom they represent. The
duty on encouragement is as much
or more incumbent upon the stu
dent body as the matter of playing
is upon the players. The team
needs support, and it is the duty of
every man to make ;iu effort to get
out and show appreciation Again,
if the team itself expects to play
ball its members must pull together
each one for all, and all for each
one. Without these things we can
never have a winning team —with
them we ought to turn out a cham
pionship nine. It is as easy done
as said. Let it be done.
