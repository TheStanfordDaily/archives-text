# FIELD-DAY TOMORROW.
## Contest on the Track Between the Freshman Class and the Oakland High School. 
### 
The rain today has been a boon
not only to the ranchers, but to the
track men. Water is scarce and
expensive this year, so that the
track manager has not been
able to keep the track in the
best condition for active training.
It had become so hard that the
men began to tind it did them
more harm than good to run on it.
With a little rolling now it will be
in excellent shape for fast time to
morrow.

Freshman Class. Manager Greg
