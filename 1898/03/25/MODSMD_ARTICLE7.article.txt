# FRESHMEN SUSTAINED.
## Debating- League Approves the '01 Committee's Action in Refusing the Challenge. 
### 
The challenge for the intercol
legiate freshman debate was re
ceived by President Bradley late
yesterday afternoon, and it was
immediately turned over to Messrs.
English, Marvin, and Victor, the
committee appointed by the class
to receive the challenge and to con
fer with the Debating League as to
details. This committee came to
the decision yesterday, before the
challenge was received, that it
would not be good policy to accept
it, inasmuch as it would be impos
sible to perfect arrangements for
the preliminaries before the vaca
tion.
At the meeting of the executive
committee of the Inter-Society De
bating League this afternoon the
Freshman committee was present
for conference, and submitted their
report for conference. After con
siderable discussion, in which it
was evident that the committee
agreed with the Freshmen that it
was not feasible to hold a contest
this semester, the following resolu
tion was adopted:
"Resolved, That the action of the
Freshman committee in refusing
the challenge for an intercollegiate
freshman debate be approved; and
be it further
"Resolved, That this committee
take action toward the institution,
in the future, of a Freshman-Soph
omore contest, in order to encour
age debating in the two lower
classes of the University."
On motion of Mr. Morgan a com
mittee consisting of Miss Andrews,
'99, Chandler,' 99, and Hayden, '00,
was appointed with power to ar
range for the time, place, and man
ner of holding an annual Fresh
man-Sophomore debate.
The committee then adjourned.
