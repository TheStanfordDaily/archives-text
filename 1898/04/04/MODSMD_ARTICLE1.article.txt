# TWO VARSITY GAMES
## The
						Defeat by Santa Clara Retrieved by the Victory Over the Nevada Nine. 
### 
On Saturday, March 26, at San
Jose, the Varsity suffered defeat at
the hands of Santa Clara for the
fourth time this season by a score
of 10 to 7. Stanford, although in
the lead at no time daring the
game,appeared to have good chances
of winning. The men practiced
hunting quite successfully, making
in all eleven hits against the seven
made off Beckett. Apparently the
reasons for the loss of the game
were the costly errors and the poor
base-running. Half of the errors
were on overthrows which netted
Santa Clara from one to three bases
apiece. The stolen base column
bears evidenee of the poor quality
of the base running.
In the first inning Graham hit
safely with two men out, and stole
around to third. Leake got a base
on bulls. Both scored on Strohn's
throw over second base which Wight
failed to stop. Santa Clara scored
in the second on Farry's hit and
Beckett's wild throw. Connor
made a long drive to center, ad
vanced a base on a sacrifice bunt
by Guerin. Garnot received first
on balls. Both were advanced a
base on Robinson's sacrifice, and
scored on Lougheed's errors. In
the fourth Robinson was hit, Tabor
got a base on balls; both profited
by Graham's sacrifice, and scored
on Leake's single. Leake crossed
the plate on Strohn's overthrow.
Kelly placed the ball in right
Held for three bases and scored on
Wight's poor throw-in. At their
last time at the bat, Santa Clara
managed to get one more run.
Garnot drove out a double, went
to third on a wild pitch and home
on a fumble by Beckett.
Stanford filled the bases in the
first inning with the first three
men up. The next two were struck
out and Harris flew out to right.
In the next inning with two out,
Swindells got a two-bagger. Loug
heed went to first on balls. Both
scored on Murphy's bunt and
Leake's error. In the third
Klauber went to first on balls and
was sent to second when Beckett
was hit by a pitched ball, reaching
home on Swindell's hit. Murphy
scored in the fourth on Connor's
wild throw and Young's single.
In the next Klauber waited with
success, and scored on singles by
Beckett and Murphy. In the
seventh, Beckett drove the ball to
the fence for three bases and tallied
on Lougheed's slow grounder
to Farry. He scored again in the
last inning on a hit to left, and
singles by Swindells and Murphy.
Klauber played an excellent
game al third. It was due to his
ability that Santa Clara lost all
desire to bunt. Strohn made two
bad overthrows. Beckett pitched a
fairly good game. While he struck
out only one man, Santa Clara
found him for only seven hits.
Murphy's hits were frequent and
timely. Young accepted lifteen
chances without an error. Stan
ford batted better than usual.
The features of the game were
the double play, Connor to Garnot
to Farry, and Robinson's magnifi

cent catch of Young's drive almost
to centerfield fence.
