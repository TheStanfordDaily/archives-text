# THE 						ONE EXCEPTION.

Alicia was woa?lng a particularly fas
cinating bliu) silk tea gown, with a liall
blown Ainorioan Beauty, which I had
brought iiji from town, naught in the laces
at the shoulder. Wo had been married just
six week 8.
"I'm awfully tired, Dicky," she began
after the butler had gone.
"Tired?" I echoed. "You don't look it,
swoelio girl!" (This last is a contraction
of "sweet little girl"—a honeymoon fan
tasy quite my own.) "Wasn't the tea
party a success?"
"Dick," my wife said tragically, "it
was horrid!"
. "Really ! And just six weeks ago Clairo
Haughton was your maid of honor and
Angie New and Vera Sweet and Daisy
Meadows were your dearest friends. CM
course, they were there?"
"Oh, yes, but, Dick, I never realized
until today how one idead and faddy and
tiresome and absolutely soliish girls can
become. They chattered incessantly—each
of her own particular fad. Such trilling
affairs! I hate people with hobbies. I
thank my stars, Dick, that you came along
and married me and saved me from taking
such narrow gauged views of life."
I bowed my thanks. "And what did the
girls talk about?" I asked. "What is Vera
Sweet's fad just now?"
Alicia made a pretty pretense of jeal
ousy. "1 always thought you rather fan
cied Vera. Well, she was tremendously
tiresome. She has just fitted up a now
music room, and when she wasn't talking
Roman drapery and oriental couches and
busts of Beethoven and Paderewski, she
was humming amateurish arias from the
operetta she's just written or quoting
Leschetiszky's method or pitying me be
cause I've not heard Melba."
"And Angie New!"
"Oh, Angela's stagestruck! Saves all
her playbills—has. you know, for years—
and keeps theatrical scrapbooks and a col
lection of stars' photographs. I think she
once had a bowing acquaintance with a
very minor actress. Anyie is always dy
ing to tell you that your matinee hero
beats his mother, that the lovely leading
lady is 55 and has been divorced three
times and that the heavy villain used to
keep a butcher shop—such stupid details!
Think of such things making up one's in
terest in life!"
"Dreadful!" I cried and shuddered.
"And there was Cerise Lovelace, who
only talks dress—it's 'Virot says this, my
dear,' or'Doucet and Felix say that,'quite
all the time. I'm glad my brain isn't put
on the bias and ilounced like hers."
"You grow savage, sweelio girl."
"Wasn't it enough to make one so?
Selfishness is always reprehensible."
"Miss Meadows seems rather the right
sort."
"Oh, but Daisy is so given up to hospi
tal and flower mission work she can think
of absolutely nothing else. And even tin r
Claire never had a particularly large vw.y
of looking at things."
Alicia reached for a wafer ;mcl nibbled it
daintily. "?..urriage,"she sighed—"n ar
riage, my dear, would simply be the sal
vation of those girls."
"Perhaps,"T answered. "I suppose a
woman must have something to love and
absolutely devote herself to. Weren't there
any other married women there, sweelio?"
"Mrs. Barley Everett-Work and Mrs.
Jeune-More. Rut someluw even they weie
tedious—one complained of her servants —
so vulgar, I think—and the other told us
all about her baby "
"So they are selfish and one idead in
spite of marriage?"
"Oh, but, Dick, they have such stupid
husbands!"
"Poor littlo woman !" I svmoathized.
