''JiEItKELEY, Cal.,
â€¢'March 28, 1898.
"My Dear Mr. Bradley: In reply
to your question, L say without re
serve that as far as 1 know no one
here has considered your corres
pondence as in any way containing
a challenge. We took the corres
pondence as purely not a class af
fair on your part, but as a personal
desire to gain something for the
class which you represent. My re
plies to you show this very clearly,
and you are at liberty to publish
them, or use them in any way you
wish, to make clear your position.
I do not understand the Palo
Alto's inference to the language
of your letters, as 1 consider your
lOngli hand spelling to be quite
proper. Yours sincerely,
"C. Duank Cobb "
Respectfully submitted,
J. F. English,
O. HAiin,
F 11. Foster,
Committee.
