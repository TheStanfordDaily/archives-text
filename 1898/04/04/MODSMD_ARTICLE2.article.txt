# The 						Reno Game.
## 
### 
The Varsity left Palo Alto Friday
on the flyer for Reno, where a game
had been arranged with the Uni
versity of Nevada nine. The team
took the 6 o'clock overland from
San Francisco, and after a thor
oughly enjoyable trip reached Reno
at 8:35 the next morning. A del
egation of students, with the Uni
versity band, was at the depot,
and the team was given a hearty
welcome. Snow had been falling
for some hours, and it seemed
scarcely possible that the weather
or grounds would permit the game
to be played. In a short time,
however, the snowstorm ceased
and the sun dried the grounds so
that it was possible to play.
The game was what would be
Called one sided. On account of
the cold weather, Beckett did not
exert himself, yet appeared to be
able to puzzle the Nevadans at
will. For two innings neither side
scored. Then Stanford struck a
batting gait, on account of which,
together with the poor fielding of
Nevada, thirty-five runs resulted
during the remainder of the game.

Nevada was able to send but one
lonely man around the bases dur
ing the game.
Stanford found the ball contin
ually, a total of no less than
twenty-five hits being made. The
hoys seemed to be able to run bases
at will. Their fielding game was
excellent, considering the weather,
the grounds, and the high altitude,
which seriously interfered with the
players' wind. Swindells caught
Beckett in fine style. Young hit
safely five times. The features of
the game were Klauber's capture of
a foul Hy after a hard run, Lan
agan's beautiful throw to the plate
from deep right, which caused
Keddie to be retired at the plate,
and a double play made by Ne
vada, Caliill to Keddie to Everett.
In the evening the team was en
tertained in the gym. with a
dance. At 10:10 the boys left
Reno on the Pullman "Ortega,"
which had been retained for their
exclusive use by Manager Kees
ling. The team arrived at the
University yesterday noon. The
boys fully appreciate the treatment
received while in Reno.
The following is the official
