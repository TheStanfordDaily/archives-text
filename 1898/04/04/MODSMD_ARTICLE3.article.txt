# FRESHMEN DEFEATED.
## The
						Recent Field Meet Won With Ease by the Oakland High School Track Team. 
### 
The field-day between the Oak
land High School and the Fresh
men ou Saturday, March 26, did
not show up any new candidates
for intercollegiate honors among
the Freshmen. Their chances of
winning were diminished by lack
of an authoritative management
to put the right men into the right
events, by the absence of some
men who would have won points,
by the lack of head-work on the
part of some of those who did
compete —and by the superiority
of the Oakland High School team.
Oakland High sent some very
good men down. Cadogan was
not pushed in either of bis runs,
and the easy way in which he ran
and his strong finishes showed
that he is capable of faster time.
Woodrum is an excellent all
around man. Weber is a new man
to us at Stanford, but in time will
be a fast mile man. The way in
which be got second in the quarter
mile run, after winning the mile,
was very clever. Harris and Nich
olson are two other men good in
any event.
Fickert, '98, and Plawof Boone's
Academy contested in the hammer
throw for records. Flaw's best
throw was 128 feet 2 inches, while
Fickert's was 121 feet. Plaw in a
morning practice made a throw of
153 feet 6 inches.
