One day of the final two weeks
< 112 training is gone. Eleven days
for work remain before the week

immediately preceding I lie twenty
third, which must he devoted to rent.
Ah we survey the prospects and
needs of the team, it is interesting
to compare them with the prospects
and needs of the the team as we
saw them at the beginning of the
semester and expressed them in
the first number of the present
volume of the Daily Palo Alto.
One prediction made then we can
repeat now with theemphasisadded
to it by the records of Berkeley's
field-day on Saturday—the team
will not he over-confident. We
were not mistaken though when we
said that there would he more can
didates out this year than ever he
fore and that the men would train
faithfully. Hut when we congratu
lated ourselves on the excellent con
dition of the cinder track and took
it for granted that the rub
bing faciltiies for training
this semester would be entirely
satisfactory we were mistaken. They
have not been. At times recently
the track has been so hard that the
men could not use it and there has
been either one or no rubber to take
care of them after their work. It
is too late to deplore this, deplor
able as it is. But for the remain
ing time the track must be in con
dition and there must be rubbers.
It is an injustice to the team, to
trainer McLeod, and to Stanford to
send our men against such a team
as Berkeley has this year without
giving them all the opportunities
that are possible to get into the
best condition. Those who have
authority must enable the track
manager to keep the track as
track should be kept. Otherwise
they must be prepared to stand
their share of the blame in the pos
sible defeat of a team which, in
spite of poor facilities, has shown a
commendable spirit of persistence
in its training.
