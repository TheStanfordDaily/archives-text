"What au afternoon! Did you really have
to listen to all that and never net in a
word with the blooming, self centered lot
of them?"
"Oh, I talked, of course. That's what
5 o'clock teas aro for. But I'm very sure
my conversation was along broader lines,
for, Dick, 1 really am growing more seri
ous, and I couldn't bear to have the whole
afternoon spent in worthless chitchat."
"Of course, your remarks weroedifying,
dearest—a merited, if severe, lesson. I've
no doubt my wife proved herself the glit
tering exception. What did you tell them?"
"First I spoko of how you hate gossip—
how you like a woman to speak sweetly of
the absent, of thnt little joko of yours
about the best tea bvvng tho chari-too that
covers a multitude o/ *ins"—
"Great Ca-sar! \V h t a pompous prig
you made of mo!"
"Not at all, Dick. I told them how you
lot me play cards for prizes, though you
disapprove it; of your selling the mastiff
you had at Princeton just because he
barked at mo once, of the roses and violets
you bring mo and how you stay at home
evenings to read to me unless wo go to tho
play or ajo dining out., and"—
"Anything olso?"
"Yes, I proved how superior you are to
other men—how noble, true and generous
and wise and how good looking, too —for
you are, Dick—just sometimes, you know,
in evening dress or in that lovely gray suit
with a pink shirt, and I'm glad you have
such a strong chin, and a straight nose,
and that dear dash of gray on the tem
ples"—
"How," I interrupted, blushing to tho
roots of the aforesaid dash of gray, "how
did the tea i arty take all this?"
"Oh, when I took my iirst breath they
all began again on tho petty interests of
their narrow existences. Bin what can
one expect from pi 'e with hobbies?"
"What, indeed?' 1 traced a design on
tho damask with my dessert spoon, mus
ing; then I loAkud up and laughed, "Or
hubbies?"
"Now, that's unkind, Dick! .lust when
I've spent the entire afternoon making
myself perfectly odious to the girls by talk
ing of nothing—but you I"
"And that, my sweetest sweetie girl, is
just where the joke comes in."
And then tho butler brought in the
bisque glace, and I shivered over tho first
spoonful and the look Alicia gave me.
Nor was she mollified until by and by 1
rose and, slipping round to her chair, said
meekly: "I want to smoke. I low can I,
sweetheart, unless you come into tho li
brary and sit on the arm of the chair and
choose my cigar and lend me the light of
your eyes?"
Then she laughed, too, and kissed me.
