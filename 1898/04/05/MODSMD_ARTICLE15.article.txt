Tomorrow's game will he the
hist opportunity of the Varsity nine
in a game before the intercollegiate
series. The team has been steadily
approaching Varsity form and all
that is needed at the present time
is the influence which the student
body can give. There is much in
the feeling that the students of the
University are behind a team in
its efforts, and such is undoubtedly
the case. Many, while wishing and
hoping for victory, never lend the
team the support of their presence.
We believe the student body is
back of the baseball men: tomor
row is the time to prove it.
