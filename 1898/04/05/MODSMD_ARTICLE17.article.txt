Zoology Club met on Monday
evening at the residence of Dr.
GilLert. Professor J. P. Smith
gave a very interesting lecture on
"Phylogeny." The following is the
substance of the talk in brief: A
geologic series of re.ated animal
forms possesses a general signifi
cance as indicating evolution, but
must bechecked off if possible by life
histories of typical forms. Where
whole groups have become extinct
such a course is impossible. But
certain mollusks develop in such a
way that the life history of the in
dividual may be read backward
from the larger to the smaller
whorls of the adult shell This is
the case with the Ammonite, a form
related to the pearly Nautilus.
With what few specimens lie could
obtain Professor Smith has worked
out from certain characters of the
shell one of the most complete
series of transitional forms ever
traced. The results of his re
searches have beer, published in
two articles, one on the ''Physiol
ogy of the (ilyphioceiatidae" in the
proceedings of the California Acad
emy of Sciences, and another on
the "Comparative oludy of Paleon
tology and Phylogeny" in the Jour
nal of Geology.
