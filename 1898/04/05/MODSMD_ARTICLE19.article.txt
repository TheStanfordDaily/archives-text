# HOW HE WAS SAVED.

In all the bad things Chris Manloy was j
easily tho worst, and his reputation as a J
drinker, a lighter and a swearer was not
bounded by the county lines. His mother j
was a Christian woman, and she prayed |
for her boy as only Christian mothers can j
pray for their boys, but as the years rolled
by she found no answer to her prayers.
But her faith was a divine faith, and she
never quit praying for Chris. She believed
that sooner or later her prayers would bo
answered.
Chris loved his mother, even if he did
not show it by his actions. He often prom
ised her to do botter, but evil companions
influenced him, promises made were soon
broken and the good mother learned that
her prayers wore not to be answered yet.
When the war of the rebellion broke out,
the patriotism of Metamora men blazed
forth and the work of recruiting a com
pany was begun. Almost the iirst one to
enlist was Chris Mauley, and with him
came a dozen of his reckless and sinful
companions. The recruiting ollicor hesi
tated about accepting the whisky reeking
young man, but after admiring his stal- j
wart frame and recalling the fact that
army discipline was often effectual in the
way of making men out. of poor material,
the recruiting officer swore Mauley into
the service.
When Chris bade his weeping mother
goodby, she handed him a little pockon
Testament.
"Promise me that you will road it once i
in awhilo, my son. Promisofor my sake."
And Chris promised and thrust the Tes
tament into his pocket. Then he marched
away to the depot with his company and
was soon on his way to Camp Douglas.
Weeks rolled into months and t he months
into years, and Chris was lying before tho
walls of Vicksburg with thousands of oth
er gallant Illinois soldiers. He had not
changed much as to habits. Ho was still
tho reckless drinker and swearer that had
afflicted Metamora, but his officers knew
that lie was a splendid fighter.

word of it. He carried it because ho really

inside tho bosom of his blouse.
It was during one of those desperate but
ineffectual charges against tho walls of
Vicksburg, in which hundreds of bravo
lives went out, that Chris Manley felt a
double shock. He felt the sharp pain of a
rifle ball plowing through his shoulder,
and also of something smiting liini in the
breast. He staggered a few steps and fell,
and soon his comrades were hurled back
from tho walls.
A comrade who saw him fall bravely
rushed out from the trenches and Lore the

When Mauley's arm was off and he had

him of his narrow escape from death and
