# A 						New Football Contract.
## 
### 
During the past week Football
Managers Prichard of Stanford
and Brown of the University of
California gave formal notice to
Colonel T. P. Kobinson, proprietor
of the Recreation Park grounds,
San Francisco, that they consid
ered the contracts entered into last
August, for two years' lease of his
grounds, at an end.
The contract has still one year
to run, and under it next season's
football game would he played at
Recreation Park, but Mr. Robinson
has violated the clause in the con
tract which provides that no liquor
shall be sold on the premises dur
ing the progress of the games.
Favorable terms have been se

cured from the management of
Central Park, and the games this
year will be played on the latter
grounds, which have been the
scene of all the football contests
since the Haight Street Park was
abandoned.
In the lease of Central Park the
football management has reserved
the right to put in their own seats.
This provision has been made to
prevent the recurrence of such an
accident as happened during last
Thanksgiving's game, when the
roof over the University Club's sec
tion fell in.
Manager Prichard has not yet
signed the contract with the Cen
tral Park management.
