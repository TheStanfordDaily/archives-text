How many students realize that
one-tenth of the student body are
boarding if not rooming at the
Camp? Seventy men sleep in the
buildings, many of these cooking
for themselves in groups of four or
five. Thirty eat at the Camp Kit
chen, which is manned by Chinese
cooks. Women students have in
vaded the Camp this year for the
first time, a boarding club of eight
which includes them in its mem
bership having its private dining
room off the same kitchen.
Until recently the ground be
tween the two long buildings has
had a negleetod air, but of late
every day has seen some improve
ment in its appearance. This
space was first cleared and plowed,
then the necessary paths were
marked out by cinders and bor
dered with thyme. At irregular in
tervals ornamental trees of many
kinds have been set out. The ingen
uity of Dane Coolidge, the manager,
has further exercised itself in thees
tablishment of a genuine fountain,
whose spray is to water the ferns
of the rockery from which itsprings.
Two retired carts have been dis
membered and made to subserve
the purposes of art in various ways.
Benches built around the three
handsome oaks add to the park
like appearance of the place, which
bids fair to become in time so at
tractive as to deflect the stream of
pilgrims to and from the postoflice,
and tempt them to enjoy with
Camp residents the flowers and the
shade.
Mrs. Stanford has encouraged
these efforts to beautify the Camp.
She realizes the advantage of such
a place to students who must econ
omize, and says that as far as she
is concerned the Cam}) is a per
manent thing.
