# A
						TRACK CONFERENCE.
## Managers Agree Upon Field-Day Details and Arbitration of Bicycle Dispute. 
### 
Track Managers Dozier of the
University of California and Greg
ory of Stanford held a conference in
Berkeley Saturday and definitely
decided to hold the Intercollegiate
Field-day on the Olympic grounds?,
San Francisco, where the field-day
has heen held for several years.
The date is that already announced,
April 23.
The athletic comirittee of the
University of California has ratified
the intercollegiate athletic agree
ment as originally agreed upon by
the delegates of Stanford and
Berkeley, by which the bicycle race
was to have been hfild the Wednes
day preceding the field-day and in
which the schedule of points was
agreed upon as 5, Â«'i. and 1, for first,
second, and third places respect
ively.
The athletic committee of Stan
ford refused to ratify the provision
relating to the holding of the bicy
cle race. Contrary to report, there
hits not been at any time any dan
ger of a serious deadlock, such as
occurred last year. The matter was
first referred to the faculty com
mittees of the two universities ac
cording to the intercollegiate agree
ment. But th ' lattsr waived their
right of settlement, and the dis
agreement will now be arbitrated
according to the intercollegiate
arbitration agreement drafted last
semester by a joint committee and
ratified by the two student bodies.
By this agreement in case of a
deadlock between the managers of
teams the president of the Uni
versity Club of San Francisco will
be requested to appoint a commit
tee of three not connected with
either university, to act as a board
of arbitration. This committee has
not yet been appointed.
