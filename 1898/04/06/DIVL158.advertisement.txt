The Well-Bressed
Collegian
Who would just as soon
be perfectly dressed at half the
price that merchant tailors
charge, will find the up-to-date

Co. exactly suited to his wants.
Their $15.00 suits, made of
fashionable cloths, in latest
styles and guaranteed to lit, are
something very much out of
the ordinary. A special invita
tion extended to faculty and
students.
