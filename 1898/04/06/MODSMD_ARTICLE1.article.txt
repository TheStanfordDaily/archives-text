# VARSITY DEFEATED.
## Game Today Lost to "Alumni" by Critical Errors in First Innings of Play. 
### 
Stanford was defeated this after
noon in the most exciting game of
hall seen here this season, by a
score of sto 4. The Varsity played
at times a brilliant fielding game
and at other times the work was
ragged. The game was a pitcher's
battle throughout. Lanagan held
the "Alumni" team down to three
hits, gave live hases on balls, and
struck out eight men. Stanford
did somewhat better with Moski
man. getting four two-baggers and
three singles; eight men struck out,
and four reached first on balls.
Stanford, as usual, bunched er
rors instead of hits at critical mo
ments, and thus lost the game.
Several times it appeared as it the
score would be tied, notably so in
the last inning, when with two out,
and two men on bases, Wight was
unable to find the ball.
Strohn played the best ball this
season, except possibly the first
game with the "Alumni." His
batting has improved, and his arm
was in good condition. Lanagan
pitched a successful game, although
lie appeared at times to be a trifle
wild. Klauber's throwing was not
up to his usual form.
If the team can play as good ball
in the nine innings against Berke
ley next Saturday as they played
during the last six innings of today's
game, we should be victorious. The
score:
STANFORD.
