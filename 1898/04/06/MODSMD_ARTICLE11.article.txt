It has been a matter of general
complaint that the student body
lias not given the baseball men the
attention and encouragement to
which they are entitled. Thiscom
plaint has in large measure heen
justified. The men have practiced
faithfully every day before empty
bleachers, and have gone into the
games ff the campus with no hack
ing, with one exception, a game at
San Jose. Even when they have
met outsiders on the campus, the
dead silence of full bleachers hits
rattled them. Good rooting has
often won a game. The only game
of the intercollegiate series which
we won last year was also the only
one where there was a considerable
and enthusiastic body of Stanford
rooters.
The first game of the champion
ship series is to be played in San
Francisco next Saturday afternoon
at Recreation Park. There will
doubtless be a large number of
students in the city on that day.
These should make it a point to at
tend the game; besides, as many as
can do so should go from here for the
sole purpose of attending the game
and doing their part in winning it.
The championship may depend
upon the first game. At the meet
ing of the Executive Committee
this evening a competent man will
be appointed to lead the yelling.
He must have a following. Give
it to him, and we may in a meas
ure offset the large delegation
which is sure to come from Cal
ifornia..
