# SHELLING PEAS.
## 
### 
A clover and wealthy man onco told a
friend that the prettiest sight he ever saw
was a girl shelling peas for the family din
ner. It was an odd remark, but the cir
cumstances that led to it were such us
might happen any day.
Horace Twemlow was an only son, and
his old father was very anxious that he
should marry and bring homo a wife to
keep house and make it homelike for them
tooth, as the mother had long been dead
and the father and son wore too much at
tached to ononnothor to wish to live apart.
Horace was not actually in love with
any one, but there were three girls bo
rather admired, so he tried an experiment.
Ho announced his intention of taking a
holiday or, at all events, of going over to
the city fora trip, saying he was not quito
Hire when ho would be able to return.
About 11 o'clock ono morning ho went to
the homo of the girl he liked best, and
when the door oponed asked for Miss Ellen
and told the maid to say that lie had called
at that unusual hour just to say good by,
as ho was leaving suddenly and had very
little time at his disposal. lie was shown
into a sitting room, separated from anoth
er by folding doors, and distinctly heard
tho voico of bis charmer saying to her
mother:
"No, mamma, I certainly will not bo
seen at this hour in this dirty old dress,
with no tucker in it and my fringe 210 C
curled."
In two or three minutes tho maid re
turned to the waiting Horace and said
Miss Ellen was very sorry not to see him,
but she was in I 1 with a bad headache.
"A girl who j.. .s on a dirty dress in tho
morning and tells litis is not tho wife for
me," thought the young man as he went
away, and, turning into tho next row of
villas, ho rang tho bell of a door which
was on the chain and stood a little way
open, giving him a view of tho staircase.
On the half landing stood the girl he had
called to see, scolding some one up above
her so vigorously that she evidently did
not notice the ring at the bell. Her voico
was so shrill and her ill temper so evident
that Horace instantly took a card out of
his case, scribbled "l 3 . P. C." on it when
the servant answered his summons and
went, his way.
The third girl he meant to call 011 lived
half a mile away. The house was small and
her parents had tho reputation of not be
ing very well off. He knocked and gavo
the same message to the maid as ho had
done at tho first house. She was not an
accomplished housemaid and left him
standing at the open door while she went
and spoke to her young mistress in a back
room. Horace heard the quiet words,
"Ask Mr. Twemlow to come in,"and ho
was shown straight into the sunny back
parlor, where Miss Mary .lones sat in a
low chair with a vegetable ciish 011 her la;i
and a large basket of green j.eas <.n ;! 0
floor beside htr. She wore a neat pink
STphyr dress, white collar and hlack tiâ€¢ 1
and a very large \.!~ito a, 1 .1 pinned u,<
quito high on 1 1 r 1 i<.ast t;..u i.i 1 hair was
..iist as nicely ; :.e as \\ 1 ;i he bad las''
seen her at u t iia.i re iki iiai.ee.
She said not a weld about l.er occupa
tion. It was evidently quite a natural
thing for her to shell pens in the r orning,
but siio laughed and talked so pleasantly
that Horace staid till she had fini.-hod and
rose to take her pi as to tho kitchen. Then
ho went, but the next day he made an ex
cuse for coming again, and, though ho
still talked of going to the t ity there did
not seem to bo any hurry about it.
Mary Jones was quite as quick witted as
other girls and soon understood what ho
meant, and got ono of her brothers to con
vex to him In the most casual way in tho
