# SHELLING PEAS.
## 
### 
A clover and wealthy man onco told a
friend that the prettiest sight he ever saw
was a girl shelling peas for the family din
ner. It was an odd remark, but the cir
cumstances that led to it were such us
might happen any day.
Horace Twemlow was an only son, and
his old father was very anxious that he
should marry and bring homo a wife to
keep house and make it homelike for them
tooth, as the mother had long been dead
and the father and son wore too much at
tached to ononnothor to wish to live apart.
Horace was not actually in love with
any one, but there were three girls bo
rather admired, so he tried an experiment.
Ho announced his intention of taking a
holiday or, at all events, of going over to
the city fora trip, saying he was not quito
Hire when ho would be able to return.
About 11 o'clock ono morning ho went to
the homo of the girl he liked best, and
when the door oponed asked for Miss Ellen
and told the maid to say that lie had called
at that unusual hour just to say good by,
as ho was leaving suddenly and had very
little time at his disposal. lie was shown
into a sitting room, separated from anoth
er by folding doors, and distinctly heard
tho voico of bis charmer saying to her
mother:
"No, mamma, I certainly will not bo
seen at this hour in this dirty old dress,
with no tucker in it and my fringe 210 C
curled."
In two or three minutes tho maid re
turned to the waiting Horace and said
Miss Ellen was very sorry not to see him,
but she was in I 1 with a bad headache.
"A girl who j.. .s on a dirty dress in tho
morning and tells litis is not tho wife for
me," thought the young man as he went
away, and, turning into tho next row of
villas, ho rang tho bell of a door which
was on the chain and stood a little way
open, giving him a view of tho staircase.
On the half landing stood the girl he had
called to see, scolding some one up above
her so vigorously that she evidently did
not notice the ring at the bell. Her voico
was so shrill and her ill temper so evident
that Horace instantly took a card out of
his case, scribbled "l 3 . P. C." on it when
the servant answered his summons and
went, his way.
The third girl he meant to call 011 lived
half a mile away. The house was small and
her parents had tho reputation of not be
ing very well off. He knocked and gavo
the same message to the maid as ho had
done at tho first house. She was not an
accomplished housemaid and left him
standing at the open door while she went
and spoke to her young mistress in a back
room. Horace heard the quiet words,
"Ask Mr. Twemlow to come in,"and ho
was shown straight into the sunny back
parlor, where Miss Mary .lones sat in a
low chair with a vegetable ciish 011 her la;i
and a large basket of green j.eas <.n ;! 0
floor beside htr. She wore a neat pink
STphyr dress, white collar and hlack ti• 1
and a very large \.!~ito a, 1 .1 pinned u,<
quito high on 1 1 r 1 i<.ast t;..u i.i 1 hair was
..iist as nicely ; :.e as \\ 1 ;i he bad las''
seen her at u t iia.i re iki iiai.ee.
She said not a weld about l.er occupa
tion. It was evidently quite a natural
thing for her to shell pens in the r orning,
but siio laughed and talked so pleasantly
that Horace staid till she had fini.-hod and
rose to take her pi as to tho kitchen. Then
ho went, but the next day he made an ex
cuse for coming again, and, though ho
still talked of going to the t ity there did
not seem to bo any hurry about it.
Mary Jones was quite as quick witted as
other girls and soon understood what ho
meant, and got ono of her brothers to con
vex to him In the most casual way in tho
world that she was engaged to a curate in
the north and they were to ho married an
eoon as he got a lhing.
Horace did not go to tho city then, but
in a lew weeks he returned ntid lived with
his father and a 11 iddlo aged housekeeper
till the old man die d. liwn tin n ho niado
no pretense ol' being a marrying iiian, and
when chaffed aLout single bleueutiess by
his iriend told the story of tho pea si t iiii.g
and laughingly said ho must wait lor
Mary's ciiloi-t oaugLicr.
"Well," said his iiiend, "hut if she will
have you there will certainly be no need
for her to shell peas. You can give a wile
quite a line establishment now and a car
riage into tho bargain."
"Yes," refilled the elderly Horace, "I
could do all tiiat, but 1 should like my
wile to be tho sweet, domestic, womanly
woman that money neither buys nor spoils,
and, though 1 may joke about Mary's
daughter, 1 hear she is going to Girton,
and I don't suppose she even knows how
to shell peas. But, for all that, 112 believe
she is her mother over again in all essen
tials."
Mary tho second had been at Girton for
throe terms when Horace Twenilow went
down to the north country vicarage for the
little family festival her parents had plan
ned for her twenty-first birthday, 'i he
young folks called hini "Uncle Horace,"
anil never considered high days and holi
days and bonliro nights were con \ hie
without him. He traveled all night and
walked up to the French window of tho
modest dining loom, where the table was
laid for breakfast, though nobody was
down yet except the Girton girl. She was
eo busy cutting delicate slices of bread and
butter, which she put on her mother's
plate, that she did not notice him and was
beginning to pub the chairs to the table
when lie stepped in.
*'Oil, Uncle Horace, what a surprise!"
she exclaimed, blushing rosj i ed,t; u ihen
the others came trooping i.j, ami liny all
talked so much and were to \ ilubiw in
their good wishes that it was a uiy noisy
break last party indeed Horace sat lie
tween tho mother and daughtir and a.-ked
the younger one to cut him some bread
and butter just as she had done lor 1.; r
mother. While she did it bo watched her
quick, capable hands and whispered to her
mother:
"Almost as graceful as shelling peas."
Tho elder Mary smiled and exchanged
glances with her husband. She had an
Idea of what was coming, and when, Inter
in tho morning, she saw Horace and her
Girton girl strolling round and round the
lawn she was sure of tho wisdom of her
surmises. Presently they came together,
and Horace said quietly:
"Mary has allowed mo to give her a l ing
fir her birthday present and promi.e t to
wear it till I exchange it fora plain gold
one.''
He was always a trille deliberate, ami a
girl graduate is not expected to he flippant,
but they were both %ery happy for all t.. t.
and one of the truest marriages on i i.
might never have come to pass had .. . i
been for that little lor.g igo • pif-od • » i.i

into a sitting room, separated from anoth
er by folding doors, and distinctly heard
tho voico of bis charmer saying to her
mother:
"No, mamma, I certainly will not bo
seen at this hour in this dirty old dress,
with no tucker in it and my fringe 210 C
curled."
In two or three minutes tho maid re
turned to the waiting Horace and said
Miss Ellen was very sorry not to see him,
but she was in I 1 with a bad headache.
"A girl who j.. .s on a dirty dress in tho
morning and tells litis is not tho wife for
me," thought the young man as he went
away, and, turning into tho next row of
villas, ho rang tho bell of a door which
was on the chain and stood a little way
open, giving him a view of tho staircase.
On the half landing stood the girl he had
called to see, scolding some one up above
her so vigorously that she evidently did
not notice the ring at the bell. Her voico
was so shrill and her ill temper so evident
that Horace instantly took a card out of
his case, scribbled "l 3 . P. C." on it when
the servant answered his summons and
went, his way.
The third girl he meant to call 011 lived
half a mile away. The house was small and
her parents had tho reputation of not be
ing very well off. He knocked and gavo
the same message to the maid as ho had
done at tho first house. She was not an
accomplished housemaid and left him
standing at the open door while she went
and spoke to her young mistress in a back
room. Horace heard the quiet words,
"Ask Mr. Twemlow to come in,"and ho
was shown straight into the sunny back
parlor, where Miss Mary .lones sat in a
low chair with a vegetable ciish 011 her la;i
and a large basket of green j.eas <.n ;! 0
floor beside htr. She wore a neat pink
STphyr dress, white collar and hlack ti• 1
and a very large \.!~ito a, 1 .1 pinned u,<
quito high on 1 1 r 1 i<.ast t;..u i.i 1 hair was
..iist as nicely ; :.e as \\ 1 ;i he bad las''
seen her at u t iia.i re iki iiai.ee.
She said not a weld about l.er occupa
tion. It was evidently quite a natural
thing for her to shell pens in the r orning,
but siio laughed and talked so pleasantly
that Horace staid till she had fini.-hod and
rose to take her pi as to tho kitchen. Then
ho went, but the next day he made an ex
cuse for coming again, and, though ho
still talked of going to the t ity there did
not seem to bo any hurry about it.
Mary Jones was quite as quick witted as
other girls and soon understood what ho
meant, and got ono of her brothers to con
vex to him In the most casual way in tho
world that she was engaged to a curate in
the north and they were to ho married an
eoon as he got a lhing.
Horace did not go to tho city then, but
in a lew weeks he returned ntid lived with
his father and a 11 iddlo aged housekeeper
till the old man die d. liwn tin n ho niado
no pretense ol' being a marrying iiian, and
when chaffed aLout single bleueutiess by
his iriend told the story of tho pea si t iiii.g
and laughingly said ho must wait lor
Mary's ciiloi-t oaugLicr.
"Well," said his iiiend, "hut if she will
have you there will certainly be no need
for her to shell peas. You can give a wile
quite a line establishment now and a car
riage into tho bargain."
"Yes," refilled the elderly Horace, "I
could do all tiiat, but 1 should like my
wile to be tho sweet, domestic, womanly
woman that money neither buys nor spoils,
and, though 1 may joke about Mary's
daughter, 1 hear she is going to Girton,
and I don't suppose she even knows how
to shell peas. But, for all that, 112 believe
she is her mother over again in all essen
tials."
Mary tho second had been at Girton for
throe terms when Horace Twenilow went
down to the north country vicarage for the
little family festival her parents had plan
ned for her twenty-first birthday, 'i he
young folks called hini "Uncle Horace,"
anil never considered high days and holi
days and bonliro nights were con \ hie
without him. He traveled all night and
walked up to the French window of tho
modest dining loom, where the table was
laid for breakfast, though nobody was
down yet except the Girton girl. She was
eo busy cutting delicate slices of bread and
butter, which she put on her mother's
plate, that she did not notice him and was
beginning to pub the chairs to the table
when lie stepped in.
*'Oil, Uncle Horace, what a surprise!"
she exclaimed, blushing rosj i ed,t; u ihen
the others came trooping i.j, ami liny all
talked so much and were to \ ilubiw in
their good wishes that it was a uiy noisy
break last party indeed Horace sat lie
tween tho mother and daughtir and a.-ked
the younger one to cut him some bread
and butter just as she had done lor 1.; r
mother. While she did it bo watched her
quick, capable hands and whispered to her
mother:
"Almost as graceful as shelling peas."
Tho elder Mary smiled and exchanged
glances with her husband. She had an
Idea of what was coming, and when, Inter
in tho morning, she saw Horace and her
Girton girl strolling round and round the
lawn she was sure of tho wisdom of her
surmises. Presently they came together,
and Horace said quietly:
"Mary has allowed mo to give her a l ing
fir her birthday present and promi.e t to
wear it till I exchange it fora plain gold
one.''
He was always a trille deliberate, ami a
girl graduate is not expected to he flippant,
but they were both %ery happy for all t.. t.
and one of the truest marriages on i i.
might never have come to pass had .. . i
been for that little lor.g igo • pif-od • » i.i
girl in a pink frock simliog icr
