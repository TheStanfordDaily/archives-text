# Tuesday Evening: Lecture.

The lecture by Professor Pease
on Pompeii last evening was thor
oughly enjoyed by the large audi

ence which filled the chapel. Fol
lowing is a brief summary:
To get in mind Pompeii as it
now appears we may think of a
town about the size of San Jose,
crowded into the smallest possible
space and surrounded by a mas
sive wall about two miles in cir
cumference. Half of this still lies
buried, and the rest is but a bare
skeleton —a spectre of a city whose
silent streets are lined with roof
less houses—at first sight a scene
of desolation and ruin.
After describing the laying out
of the town by an Italic tribe more
than six centuries before Christ,
the lecturer went on to say:
This little colony prospered in
spite of its wars and grew to be a
business center of some importance.
It was a distributing point for the
inland towns, and to their exports
added its own products- -wine, oil,
pumice stone, the cabbages for
which it was famous, and a kind of
sauce called garuin, which was the
delight of Epicurus.
Under the colonnades of the
forum gathered the business man
and the trader. There too were the
aspirants for local office whose
names and attainments, posted on
every wall, still meet the eye. In
the basilica near by the courts held
session, the lawyers sparring,
wrangling, and pleading as in
modern times. The numerous shops
that line all the frequented streets
testify to the amount of business.
Particularly numerous were the
shops where hot drinks were sold,
a feature of all seaport towns. In
table-furnished rooms adjoining
them gambling too was prevalent,
as the paintings on some of the
walls suggest.
The trades people had their
guilds, supported their favoritecan
didatesfor oflice, and expressed their
views as a unit in all municipal af
fairs. Besides public baths, there
were two well-equipped theaters,
and at one end of the town an
amphitheater capable of seating
20,000 spectators So attractive
were the surroundings and climate
of the place that Cicero had a villa
near by. The Emperor Claudius
and the wealthy Seneca also spent
much time there.
One day, the fifth of February,
(53 A. 1)., this beautiful region was
shaken by a terrible earthquake.
A Hock of (»00 sheep disappeared in
a fissure of the earth, Statues were
thrown down, houses, temples, and
other public buildings were shaken
to the ground. Sixteen years later
came the greater catastrophe which
nearly blotted from existence the
three towns of Herculaneum,
Stabiae, and Pompeii.
The latter town was almost com
pletely buried by ashes and lapilli.
Everywhere there evidences of hasty
flight and panic.
Signor Fiorelli has obtained
casts of some of these who per
ished. The fine dust that settled
around the lifeless bodies had liar
dened into a firm mould, and by
pouring liquid plaster into this
space and allowing it to harden
he obtained a cast of the whole
body. In terrible realism we are
made aware of the death struggles
of some and the quiet resignation
of others.
