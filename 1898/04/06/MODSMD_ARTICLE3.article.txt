# LEO XIII IN THE VATICAN.
## Lecture Friday Evening by the Famous American Novelist. F. Marion Crawford. 
### 
F. Marion Crawford will appear
at the University under the au
spices of the Class of '99 next Fri
day evening and will give his most
popular lecture, "Leo XIII in the
Vatican," a character sketch of the
greatest pope the world has seen in
centuries.
Mr. Crawford is a man of an at
tractive personality, without any
limit to his practical experience,
and has had the advantages of a
cosmopolitan life, having been born
in Italy, schooled in America and
England, and a traveler in almost
every land. His literary work be
gan after his experience as an editor
in India, and his first novel, "Mr.
Isaacs," was based on his Indian
experiences. From that time on
Mr. Crawford has been one of the
most famous American novelists,
and has won from Andrew Lang
the title of "the most versatile and
various of modern novelists."
Everywhere in California Mr.
Crawford has been greeted by large
and cultured audiences. His lec
ture in San Francisco, March 28,
on "Leo XIII" was especially well
received. The following is from the
San Francisco Chronicle:
"A house of flattering propor
tions tilled the California Theater
last night to listen to F. Marion
Craw ford, the lecturer. Doubtless the
same people had sat many times
at the feet of Crawford, the writer,
and the fact that there were other
notable, if less intellectual, attrac
tions in town did not prevent the
audience from being cultured and
fashionable, as well as enthusiastic
and numerous. It is probable iliat
most of the people who listened
last night will want to hear the
distinguished man tonight, when
he talks of other and more per
sonal things.
"Mr. Crawford was received with
hearty applause, which was but a
faint premonition of what he was
to receive when lie closed. He is
not a magnetic speaker, for he is
cool, unimpassioned, and delib
erate. But lie has a tine presence, un
studied gestures, expressive hands,
a good voice magnificently han
dled, an open face that changes
expression with every sentence, and,
above all, a stock of fine, pure
English, and an elevated, though
simple, style that place him high
among lecturers. His sentences
are perfectly formed and balanced,
and there is not a single excresence
left unpolished. Yet lie is never
elocutionary. He is at all times a
master of English prose, with a
wide and deep vocabulary, and a
faculty of vivid, terse description.''
The following clipping is from
the Examiner's account:
"Marion Crawford, the author of
'Saracinesco,' 'Mr. Isaacs,' 'A Ko
man Singer,' and other famous
novels of uniformly even power,
is also a most fascinating lecturer.
His appearance last evening came
as a surprise to most. When a
quietly picturesque and certainly
entertaining reading was ex
pected, there came a fluent, virile
delivery in a strong, clear voice,
many well-rounded and well-sound -1

ing periods, some splendid word
pictures and striking contrasts,and
an occasional flight of eloquence in
which, to the choiceness of lang
uage and the vividness of descrip
tion, there was added the fire of
oratory, the magnetism of the hu
man voice."
Reserved seats are now on sale
at the University Bookstore at
seventy-five cents. General admis
sion is fifty.
