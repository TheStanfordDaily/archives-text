# THE 						OTHER WOMAN.
## 
### 
Sylvia Benson sat staring moodily into
tho lire.
"If she hadn't cheated mo out of any
thing but love,"she thought, "I wouldn't
have cared so much, but to bo robbed of a
home! It takes two people to make a
home, and Ellen and Tryphony are mar
ried, and John's wifo don't like mo, and
I'm a lonely, homeless old woman," she
moaned, with an abandon of self pity that
was a luxury in itself. "If she hadn't
stoio him from mc—I know her —her
smiles and pretty sayings and bold black
eyes—he'd have come back for me, as he
said. I never meant to hate not even a
snake, and I've begged tho life of ono
from .John before now, but that woman
in the west! I hope I maybe forgiven,
when tho books aro opened on the last
day," she thought tremblingly, "if they
find I've hated that woman in the west."
After a half hour she rose and lighted a
(small lamp. From its place on tho white
mantelshelf its rays fell dimly upon tho
small oblong room, its full ingrain carpet,
with its pattern of white fern leaves, tin 1
cane seated chairs, the haircloth and wil
low rockers, tho marble topped center ta
ble and the pictures of bygone faces, look- ■
ing down from their homemade fran.es ox i
painted acorns and sections of walnut I
shells. A few books, which looked as i\ I
they were meant to serve any purpose j
rather than that of reading, ' »y upon the |
table. The whole room was arranged with j
the precision of a carpenter's square anil
had tho look of humble subjection which j
matter sometimes acquires when it is un
der despotic control. Sylvia moved about
the room vaguely for a few minutes and
at last nervously rearranged a book in
hasty fear lest its edge should not be in j
exact parallel with that of another; then I
slio leaned upon the mantelshelf and
thought about tho propriety of making a
cup of tea.
"I'm tiled of tea," she thought petulant
ly. "It's weak, flimsy stuff, anyhow. 1'vo
worn out its taste, 1 guess. Things don't
have a flavor to a body alone, anyway. To
think," she went on, after a minute, "that
year in and year out I never have put a
leaf into my table."
She seated herself again by the hearth,
her face darkened by its protest against
the injustice of fortune.
There was silence for a minute, broken
then by the sound of a step on the porch
and a knock at the door. Sylvia opened it
and saw a stranger there, a woman whose
only characteristics she noted were a spare
ness of figure and a pair of large, dark
eyes.
"Is this Miss Sylvia Benson?" asked the
stranger, in a clear, concise voice.
"Yes," said Sylvia, withdrawing a few
paces. "Won't you come in?"
Tho stranger stepped briskly into the
room.
"Won't you sit down?" said Sylvia, an
she retreated to the mantelshelf whoio
she stood regarding her visitor with much
curiosity.
The stranger calmly seated herself i.i
one of the straight backed chairs.
"I'm Mary Andrews, from loway," sliu
said.
Sylvia started and grasped a corner <.t
tho shelf.
"I married Tom Andrews, you know.' 1
"Yes," faltered Sylvia.
"lie was an old sweetheart of yours, ho
said, though ho didn't say anything to mo
about you till after we were married. If
bo had, gracious knows," she said, with
an odd, abrupt laugh, "you might have
been comin to mo 'stead of me to you.
Well, ho died a fow months ago, and it
was high time," she said grimly; "for ho
was gettin crazy with tho drink and tho
izamblin and all sorts of wickedness, and
i was gerrm neartsiefi oi swearin anstarv
in an bcatii)! ltwas in his U.n.ily, wasn't
it?" inquiringly. "His lather warn't nono
of this best, was he?"
Syhia made no motion of denial.
"And when he was dead, and I'd count
ed up my money, I wasn't s-eu led in niy
mind what 1 should do or wl ere I should
go. i was try in to think of son.c one iliat
would be glad to see me, or owid n.u a
kindness and I'd ulU'ii thoughtol you and
how he'd said you d never married, and 1
thought I'd come east; because," she said
eagerly, ' J thought il there was anybody
in the world that ought tu heglad to see me
it was you; lor I knew I'd gi\en up my
life in the place of yours. I wanted to tell
you what you owe me. You never can
imagine what I've saved you from," she
said with sudden vehemence; "the shame
—the—the—hate I"
The brave, strong voice broke, and Syl
via saw her set her teeth upon her lips.
"Take off your bonnet," said Sylvia
gently; "because, of course, you'll stay
with me tonight. I'll make some ton,"
she said, slipping hastily out of the room.
When she stood again at the door with
her fragrant, steaming cup, she stopped to
wonder why her life, lonely as it still was
and promised to be, suddenly seemed easi
er to bear, and she knew at once that she
was glad to be free from tho burden of her
resentment.
"It's good tea," said Mrs. Andrews,
looking gratefully from her cup.
"I'm glad you like if," said Sylvia sim
ply; then, alter a few minutes' pause,
"and now tell me what lowa is like —the
crops and the climate and the folks."
Many years have passed since Mrs. An
drews' arrival, but is still a resident of
the New England town. She has developed
a great talent lor nursing and is incon
stant demand—too constant, Sylvia thinks,
for Sylvia's home is Airs. Andrews head
quarters, to which she returns at intervals
to report the details of her campaigns.
Sylvia misses her w hen gone ami longs lor
her home coining.
The two women sit together by the win
ter lire and spend many an hour discuss
ing Mrs. Lane's lack ot wisdom in roast
ing steak by a slow lire or Mrs. Gray's in
difference to dust, but the months pass
ami never a word do they say about that
memory in whose shadow they sit while
it makes for theiu a silent bond c.i syn -
| athy.
Mrs. Andrews' thought wanders back
to the unhappy scenes of her past, and she
rejoices chielly that they soiun and lose
their sharpness of detail as they draw
farther away into the distance of tin.o.
And Sylvia still dreams of a promise that
had the assurance of iron il it did not
prove so strong, and, turning her eyes
away in fear and shame lest the otiier
woman should read her thoughts, still be
lieves that her love might have sa\od I.or
lover —even from himself. —Springlieid
