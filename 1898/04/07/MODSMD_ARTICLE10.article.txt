# THE
						OTHER WOMAN.

### 
Sylvia Benson sat staring moodily into
tho lire.
"If she hadn't cheated mo out of any
thing but love,"she thought, "I wouldn't
have cared so much, but to bo robbed of a
home! It takes two people to make a
home, and Ellen and Tryphony are mar
ried, and John's wifo don't like mo, and
I'm a lonely, homeless old woman," she
moaned, with an abandon of self pity that
was a luxury in itself. "If she hadn't
stoio him from mc—I know her —her
smiles and pretty sayings and bold black
eyes—he'd have come back for me, as he
said. I never meant to hate not even a
snake, and I've begged tho life of ono
from .John before now, but that woman
in the west! I hope I maybe forgiven,
when tho books aro opened on the last
day," she thought tremblingly, "if they
find I've hated that woman in the west."
After a half hour she rose and lighted a
(small lamp. From its place on tho white
mantelshelf its rays fell dimly upon tho
small oblong room, its full ingrain carpet,
with its pattern of white fern leaves, tin 1
cane seated chairs, the haircloth and wil
low rockers, tho marble topped center ta
ble and the pictures of bygone faces, look- ■
ing down from their homemade fran.es ox i
painted acorns and sections of walnut I
shells. A few books, which looked as i\ I
they were meant to serve any purpose j
rather than that of reading, ' »y upon the |
table. The whole room was arranged with j
the precision of a carpenter's square anil
had tho look of humble subjection which j
matter sometimes acquires when it is un
der despotic control. Sylvia moved about
the room vaguely for a few minutes and
at last nervously rearranged a book in
hasty fear lest its edge should not be in j
exact parallel with that of another; then I
slio leaned upon the mantelshelf and
thought about tho propriety of making a
cup of tea.
"I'm tiled of tea," she thought petulant
ly. "It's weak, flimsy stuff, anyhow. 1'vo
worn out its taste, 1 guess. Things don't
have a flavor to a body alone, anyway. To
think," she went on, after a minute, "that
year in and year out I never have put a
leaf into my table."
She seated herself again by the hearth,
her face darkened by its protest against
the injustice of fortune.
There was silence for a minute, broken
then by the sound of a step on the porch
and a knock at the door. Sylvia opened it
and saw a stranger there, a woman whose
only characteristics she noted were a spare
ness of figure and a pair of large, dark
eyes.
"Is this Miss Sylvia Benson?" asked the
stranger, in a clear, concise voice.
"Yes," said Sylvia, withdrawing a few
paces. "Won't you come in?"
Tho stranger stepped briskly into the
room.
"Won't you sit down?" said Sylvia, an
she retreated to the mantelshelf whoio
she stood regarding her visitor with much
curiosity.
The stranger calmly seated herself i.i
one of the straight backed chairs.
"I'm Mary Andrews, from loway," sliu
said.
Sylvia started and grasped a corner <.t
tho shelf.
"I married Tom Andrews, you know.' 1
"Yes," faltered Sylvia.
"lie was an old sweetheart of yours, ho
said, though ho didn't say anything to mo
about you till after we were married. If
bo had, gracious knows," she said, with
an odd, abrupt laugh, "you might have
been comin to mo 'stead of me to you.
Well, ho died a fow months ago, and it
was high time," she said grimly; "for ho
was gettin crazy with tho drink and tho
izamblin and all sorts of wickedness, and
