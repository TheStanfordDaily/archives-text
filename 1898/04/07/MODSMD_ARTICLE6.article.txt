# BASEBALL ADVICE
## Varsity Coaches Confident of Victory if the Team Follows Their "Dont's." 
### 
Coach Sheehan, '95, and C. L.
Thompson, '97, were interviewed
today about the team under their
charge and yesterday's game. They
said: "The game was lost yester
day by a lack of ginger and very
unusual errors. The score shows
that, with the exception of the first
innings, we played winning base
ball.
"The team is in good shape and
we think it will win next, Saturday,
but we would like you to publish a
few 'donts' for them to remember
in their game Saturday." Coach
Sheehan's "dont's" are as follows:
Don't forget to ginger.
Don't forget that the game is not
won until the last man is out.
Don't get rattled.
Don't forget that you are making
history for Stanford.
Don't forget, "Dat it's runs, not
hits, what wins games."
Don't swing at the ball, â€”meet it.
Don't always try to swell your
batting average; sacrifice.
Don't forget th t a base on balls
is as good as a hit.
Don't step away from the plate.
Don't forget that you are not out
until the ball reaches first base.
Don't reach fora ball; the plate
is there fora purpose.
Don't mix up on ground hits.
Don't fail to listen for"the ball"
on a fly ball.
Don't try to touch a runner
twice; once is enough.
Don't attempt to stretch your
hits.
Don't watch the ball on a hit;
watch the coacher.
Don't forget the right angle at
third on the way home.
Don't wait to see if your hit is
foul; the umpire will tell you that.
Don't forget that the pitcher can
be "worked" as well as yourself.
Don't be afraid of your face.
Slide !
Don't forget how many men are
out.
Don't overrun your base.
Don't forget to be on your base
on a fly ball.
Don't forget the infield fly and
block ball rules.
Don't forget that the catcher may
may miss the third strike or fourth
ball.
Don't shirk hard chances.
Don't try your arm when the
runner has the bag safe.
Don't fail to back up on the
easiest play; it may be necessary.
Don't go to sleep on snap throw
downs.
Don't hold the ball in the out
field; it belongs to the infield.
Don't throw from the outfield to
home on the fly.
Don't fail to start when the ball
is hit.
Don't fail to come in fast on
short hits.
Don't fail to take a chance at a
long fly.
Don't forget that Berkeley beat
us last year.
There will be no more regular
practice games this week. The
practice will consist of a hard drill
in batting,
