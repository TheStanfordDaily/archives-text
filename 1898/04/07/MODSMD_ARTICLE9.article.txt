The number of tickets already
sold for the Crawford lecture shows
that the chapel will he well filled
tomorrow night, while the interest
that is manifested in the choice of
the lecture indicates that the audi
ence will be appreciative. Since
the announcement of the title
of the lecture some question
ing as to the wisdom of the
choice has been heard at the office
of the Daily Palo Alto. The pro
moters of the lecture selected the
lecture that they thought would be
the most interesting, but if it is
evident that one of the others
would be more acceptable the
change can be easily made. What
ever the lecture finally chosen may
be, there is no doubt that it will
be interesting, for all the lectures
have been highly praised by those
who have heard them. Most of the
people who will hear the lecture
are interested in the personality of
the lecturer. It is to see and hear
tlie man whom they already know
through his books that they will
attend. Mr. Crawford has been
received with enthusiasm wherever
lie has appeared in the United
States. A university, of all places,
is the place where a man of culture
should gain the most hearty ap
preciation.

While in the midst of editorial
.duties this afternoon the staff (if
j the Daily Palo Alto was sur
! prised by two expressmen who de
| Jivered a bulky, box-shaped object
addressed to the editor. A close
examination revealed a writing
desk of fine proportions, which put
to shame the dilapidated excuse
I fora desk which litis done duty
since time immemorial. The fol
lowing note addressed to the Daily
Palo Alto, care of the editor-in-
I chief, explained the mystery:
"Can you persuade the manage
ment of the Daily Palo Alto to
give the accompanying article
space? If so you will greatly oblige
the contributors, who are none
'others than The Management of
the Special Edition."
Contributions to the columns of
this paper are always received with
pleasure, but it has never been our
good fortune before today to give
an article space which was so exactly
suited to the needs of the paper
that it required no use of the edi
tor's blue pencil. The special edi
tion of this paper issued last sem
ester by the young ladies of the
University will always be a record
of the ability of the editors and
managers, while in the Daily Palo
Alto office the memory of their
visit will be preserved by the pres
ence of their gift to the paper. The
present management accents with
thanks the desk, in trust for the
Daily Palo Alto.
