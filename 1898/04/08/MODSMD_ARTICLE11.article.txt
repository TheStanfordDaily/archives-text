The baseball teiini will go into
the game tomorrow after a long
season of hard and severe work,
during which Varsity form has been
hard to attain. The team has had
to work hard and the results have
been manifested bv the constant
improvement. The men of late
have been playing spirited ball,
and we hope to see the same tomor
row. If the men will rush the ball
along the entire game as they are
capable of doing, the chances for
victory are excellent. Spirit and
"ginger'' among the players, good
support from the students, will do
much to give the game a cardinal
glow. The team is representative
of Stanford, and we feel confident
of their ability to uphold our colors.
