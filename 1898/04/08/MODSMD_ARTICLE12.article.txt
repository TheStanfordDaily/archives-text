As Freshmen we are dimly aware
that we are members, though we
may not pay our fees, of an indefi
nite something.called the '' student
body." But football, debates, les
sons, and social life claim our in
terest, and we are likely to be here
some time before realizing that in
the Associated Students we have a
nation in miniature. We have our
constitution, our president, our
councils, and various associations.
Traditions hang over us concerning
certain policies and certain tenden
cies in our growth. Like larger
republics we have our political
parties. And because we are co
educational we have the woman
question, ably discussed in this
week's Sequoia.
Upon a large body of students J
the sociological lessons to be learned
in student affairs are entirely lost.
These students pass all day long
from class t.) class thence
home, asking from the rest only to
be let alone. The affairs of certain
smaller organizations occupy some j
of them at times ; those of the stu

dent hodv seldom, if ever. Into
this class of apathetic and inactive
fall the women of the student body,
with few exceptions. Has it ever
occured to tliein, the men and wo
men of this class, that real life calls
for experience as well as knowledge,
calls for executive ability, and for
the power to co-operate with others
for definite ends? These early years
in the life of a vigorous institution!
like ours give rare opj ortunities to |
gain experience through activity in
student affairs.
As long as the young women of i
Stanford rest upon their reputation j
as good students and fail to see the
implication of their entire neglect j
of student body interests, so long i
will student budy unity and har
mony be impossible, so long will I
Stanford's women graduates leave
us less well prepared to take up
active work in the world than their
classmates, the men. This state of
affairs is not all we could wish in
a leading institution of the West.
