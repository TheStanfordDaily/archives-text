# JOHN WAS SHABBY.
## 
### 
It was tho frivolous looking little wom
an with the blond bang who told how she
hud saved enough money on her husband's
wardrobe to buy her chinehilla cape and
muff.
At first the other married women pres
ent jeered and laughed and frankly sug
gested that she had been looting John's
pockets at night or selling his cast offs to
tho ragman, but she got a word in at last
and gave so interesting a description of
how the fund for the chinchillas was laid
by that she not only silenced her accusers,
but sent them off so thoughtful that she
is sure her small seeds of advico did not
fall in stony or thorny ground.
"You see," she said, smoothing her gray
muff tenderly, "I have wanted chinchillas
ever sincfe I married, and, though John
undoubtedly has an excellent business, wo
don't pretend to be rich people, and I
couldn't screw my courage up to the point
ef asking the dear boy to let me go in debt
for them. In spite of my best endeavors I
found it was only pennies I could save on
tho marketing, and when I began to cast
my avaricious eyes about in earnest they
lighted on my hardworking husband tum -
bling into his overcoat preparatory to giv
ing me a hasty moist kiss and dashing out
after his car.
"Years ago, when he went a-courting,
John was ono of the greatest dandies in
town, and 1 think I fell in love with him
as much for his exquisitely selected ties,
perfectly fitting coats and irreproachable
hoots as anything else. Since our mar
riage I had to confess ho had been, sartori
ally at least, going steadily down hill, and
that very day I determined to turn him
right about face. Of course, at first I un
generously compared him to my immacu
late coif and wondered why 1 could do such
marvels on cheap dressmakers and no
lady's maid, while his gloves and ties
looked so disreputable and his general as
pect so shockingly slouchy. I flattered
myself I always darned his socks and put
011 his buttons, as any good wife should,
and when I went homo and addod up his
tailor's, hatter's and shoemaker's bills I
nearly fainted to find that ho actually
spent every year nearly double what I did
on dress.
"Of course, my first natural feminine
instinct was to scold. Happily, I grimly
overhauled his room first, his closets, cup
boards and drawers, and found where tho
difficulty lay.
"All his neckties were handily swing
ing on tho gas fixture, to collect every bit
of dust; his dress shoes wore kicked upside
down in a closet corner, summer sweaters
lay in the very path of tho moths, hand
some golf tweeds came down from a shelf
already chewed into uselessness, and —but
I spare you further harrowing details. Let
it suffice that I took that pathetic wardrobe
in hand.
"Every morning I devoted a part of tho
time usur'ly spent in coddling my own
clothes, stuffing my sleeves with tissue pa
per and smoothing my ribbons to attend
ing to John's possessions. We couldn't
nfford a valet, but I pressed the housemaid
into service and under my direction and
quite unbeknown to our victim we worked
some miracles.
"I had John's top bureau drawer divid
ed by a carpenter into sections, and there
I laid his ties, handkerchiefs, gloves, col
lars and cuffs, protoctod, yet quite handy;
for men, you know, hate to have their
things kept in boxes, while they will take
kindly to a sectional drawer. After this I
invested in a case for his top hat, trees for
his shoes and a tailor's goose. Sending
things to bo pressed and cleaned by a pro
fessional is an expensive practice, bo I
showed tho maid how, by using naphtha
or merely a niece of brown naner and a
hot iron, spots coulil lie easily eradicated,
ami with tho hca\y gouso 1 taught her to
press John's clothes.
"Finally I persuaded John never to
wear the same suit to business two days
in succession, hut hy alternatinn between
the browns and (he gra\s always to ha\o
ono suit to rest uji lor a day and undergo
an enthusiastic) airing, brushingand press
ing. Then every month laid out for him
was a set cjl' clothes, qtntn"orJsp and sweet
smelling, and to help tho good etiuso of
eradicating the odors of tobacco and gen
eral stuffiness that hang about the cieanest
man's woolen garments, I put in bis
drawers and closets plenty of vertivert
and dried lavender.
"Right around the corner from our
house is a little tailor, of whom I certain
ly wouldn't permit .Tolm to buy his clothes,
but a cheap, neat little man, who Will put
on fresh braids, reface trousers legs and
do odd bits of tailoring at a low price. To
him I took a quantity of tilings John had
tossed aside us of no further use, and so
neatly did lie furbish them up that that
innocent husband of mine is wearing them
under the impression that they never wore
out at all.
"It required a brief struggle on the part
of mistress and maid to learn how a man's
clothes are properly folded, that a dress
suit must rot bo blushed with a whisk
broom, and that tho thing to do with felt
and silk hats for renovation is to have
them blocked, but we have learn d—
learned even to do up John's patent leath
ers irreproachably and sew liis coat but
tons on without putt ing tho thread through
the* tweed and lining, ton, and making
everything pucker.
"Between the two of us we turn out a
model man every morning, a sweet, smil
ing, immaculate creature, with never a
wrinkle in his waistcoat front, with fault
less creases down his trousers legs and his
overcoat pockets wearing their Daps out
side instead of in. Altogether the sort of
man who looks as if his wile kept her eye'
right on him and took as much pride in
his personal appearance as her own.
"But the long and short of it is, ladies,"
said this arch domestic economist, rising,
"besides tho pride and sentiment and duty
of this tiling, there is bright, hard, yellow
gold to be saved or made out of looking
after your husband's wardrobe. When
John cast up his accounts attheend of the
year and found, to his vast astonishment,
that his personal expenses had lalien lar
below the usual figure, he ga . e mo a long,
searching glance, asked me what 1 wanted
most in this world, and I said chinchillas."
