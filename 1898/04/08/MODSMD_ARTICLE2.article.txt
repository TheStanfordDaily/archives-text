# INTERCOLLEGIATE GAME.
## Tomorrow the Varsity Will Contest for Honors with the California Nine. 
### 
The first of the series of Inter
collegiate baseball games will be
played at Recreation Park, Eighth
and Harrison streets, tomorrow at
3 p.m. The question of umpires
has not been settled. Among those
mentioned for the position are
Donahue, Creamer, Gagus, and
Mertes.
The management has made a
new arrangement regarding seats.
Those on the first base line are re
served for the Stanford sympa
thizers, and the Berkeley rooters
will be directly opposite. There
will be no reserved seats, and the
game will begin promptly at 3
o'clock. The Stanford section will
be marked off with cardinal bunt
ing. Present indications are that
the game will be well attended
from the University.
Following are the rival Varsities:

The team is in good shape.
Beckett is in fine condition. The
team leaves tomorrow morning on
the flyer, and will rest in the city

until the game. The make-up of
the team is the same as the one for
the last Santa Clara game, and
there are no surprises. The U. C.
line-up was received today from
the Californian.
