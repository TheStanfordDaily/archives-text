# Pacific Grove Summer School.
## 
### 
R. L. Sandwick, '95, the winner
of the first Carnot medal contest, has
been here this week on business re
lating to the Pacific Grove Summer
School, which is to be instituted
the next season.
The failure of the University to
hold its annual summer school has
led the people of Pacific Grove to
take up the plan, and Mr. Sand
wick was acting as secretary of the
board which has charge of the ar
rangements. The object of his visit
was to interest members of the
faculty in the project, and, natur
ally enough, to secure the services
of a number of professors. In this
he has been successful. The Uni
versity will also recognize the work
done in the school.
Mr. Sandwick left today f(.r the
University of California fora like
purpose.
