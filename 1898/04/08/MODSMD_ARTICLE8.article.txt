# Vespers.
## 
### 
| Beginning next Thursday, April
, 14, a vesper service will be held
J every Thursday afternoon at 5
o'clock in the University chapel.
I It will be a distinctively religious
service of praise and prayer, with
a short talk by some member of
the faculty. A mid-week service
of this kind, lasting about half an
hour at the close of the day's work,
will, it is felt, fill a real want in
the spiritual life of the University.
For the rest of this semester the
vesper service will take the place
of the daily morning chapel.
All members of the University
community are cordially invited to
attend. The service next Thursday
will be conducted by Professor
Thoburn.
