						BASEBALL DEFEAT.
## First Game of the Intercollegiate Series Lost to the Men of the Blue and Gold. 
### 
Fortune did not smile on the
baseball men Saturday. Victory
was given to U. C. l>y a score of 7
to 3, and now every Stanford rooter
is telling a different story of how it
happened.
The game demonstrated that the
predictions that Stanford would
win if the team did not go to pieces
at critical times of the game were
based on facts. With the excep
tion of the fourth inning, in which
U. C. scored five runs on one hit,
two men hit by pitcher,one base on
halls, and three errors by Stanford,
our team played a clean fielding
game, superior to that of U. C , ran
bases equally well, and surpassed
the Californians in stick work.
The good play of the other eight
innings, however, could not counter
balance the one inning in which
five blue-shirted U. C. men tore
around the bases like ligures in a
kinetoscope.
Beckett's pitching was the feature
of the game. He was cool and
steady in every crisis, and the re
sult of the game can in no way he
attributed to him. He was hit
safely only live times, and gave
four bases on balls, hitting, how
ever, by pitched balls three men.
Kaarsburg, on the contrary, was
hit freely and often, but he also
showed steadiness at critical points,
striking out six Stanford men, us
ually when hits were needed.
The bunting on the part of our
team was a failure, Murphy only
securing a successful bunt. In
spite of the eleven hits the batting
was unsatisfactory. Men holding
leading positions in batting were
weakest in securing hits when they
were needed, and some men hereto
fore unreliable at the bat distin
guished themselves by their stick
work. Too many attempts were
made to work the pitcher, instead of
to meet some of Kaarsburg's straight
strikes.
In the first inning U. C. was
retired in one two three order, and
Stanford came to the bat. With
two men out, Wight got his base on
balls, and was brought in by Beck
ett's long drive to right for two
bases.
Bride crossed the plate for Cali
fornia in the second on a base on
balls, Hoag's sacrifice, and Kaars
burg's hit to Beckett, which car
omed from Beckett's hand out in
right field.
In the third Swindells got a hit.
Lougheed followed with another,
and reached second on Collins poor
throw to first. An error by Mc-
Laren on second let Swindells in.
With Lougheed on third, Murphy
struck out, Wight popped a fly to
left, and Beckett was retired on a
grounder to third.
Stanford's Waterloo came in the
fourth inning. Bride was hit by
a pitched ball, stole second, and
was advanced to third by Hoag's
hit. Kaarsburg struck out, and
Hoag stole second. McLaren
reached first on balls, filling the
bases. Baer hit a sharp grounder
to Harris, an easy chance which
he failed to stop, Bride and Hoag

reaching the plate. McLaren
reached third in the interim and
Baer second. McCabe brought
McLaren in on a long fly along the
first base line, which Swindells
failed to judge correctly after a
long run. McCabe reached second
and Haer third on the throw-in.
Baer scored on a passed ball
McCabe came in on Klauber's error
on Mein's easy grounder to third.
Cheeseborough struck out. Young
put the third man, Bride, who had
started the procession, out on ii
grounder to first.
The Stanford rooters had given
the team good support during this
inning, but their yelling was
more spontaneous in the next
when Young came up to the plate
and landed tlie sphere over the left
field fence, fiis hit was the longest
ever seen on the Recreation
grounds, and surpassed his other fa
mous hit two years ago at San Jose.
Strohn followed with a pretty hit,
and Harris reached his base on an
error. With none out, the next
three men Hew out.
Stanford made a pretty double
in the fifth, Lougheed to Harris to
Young, and another in the sixth,
Murphy to Harris.
In the seventh Stanford was
clearly out of luck. Wight led off
with a nice hit. Beckett touched
the ball to second, a double play
resulting. Young hit a short
bounding ball to pitcher and
reached first. Strohn came up
fora two-bagger, which made
things look interesting. Harris'
bat cracked next, and the ball went
sailing to center, seemingly fora
safe hit, but Hong managed to
scoop it up while at full speed, and
then made several spectacular som
ersaults, emphasizing his sensa
tional catch. Three hits and not
a run.
U. C. scored another run in the
ninth on two hits. Strohn retired
the side on a pretty catch of a
foul.
Lougheed and Young in the in
field, Wight and Murphy in the
outfield, played in good form.
Strohn, with the exception of two
passed balls, one costly, caught a
good game. Harris, with the ex
ception of the fourth inning,accepted
all his chances without an error.
The score follows:
