Mrs Plieeble shakes her head. '"He
ain't likrly to get none," sho says do
spondontly. "lie tramps round early and
late tryin to find a job, but it seems as if
he's in a poor streak of luck. I could get
a good plnco tomorrow, to do wash in by
the day, but there ain 't nobody to leave the
baby with."
"The creche â€”the day nursery," It Is
suggested promptly.
"They won't take any baby as young as
mine," says Mrs. Plieeble. "I went to
two t hat's near the place I could get work
at, but there wasn't a chance."
"How old is the baby now?"
"Six weeks. They say they can't take
children under 10 months. They are too
much trouble."
The nurse was thoughtful for a moment.
"I suppose your boy hero could not look
after the baby while you were out?" she
ventured.
"Oh, no, I couldn't trust him. Besides
he's ailin a good deal, and when it's so
that he can go I like to send him to school.
He couldn't go today because he's got
such a cold."
The pasty faced boy standing back of the
stove moved uneasily in the conscious way
of a child who lincis himself the subject of
conversation
"Has he got an overcoat?" was asked.
"Yes, but he can't get into it. It's too
little for him."
"And rubbers?"
"Yes, but there's a hole in the heel of
'em. I was thinldn to get. 'em mended
somo way."
"Are you certain you could get. work,
Mrs. Pheeble?" asked the other visitor,
who had sat silent in tbo midst of these
dismal reckonings.
"Yes, ma'am, I've got a good reference
from the people I worked with four years,
and I could go back there .tomorrow."
"And your husband can't get work?"
"No; he trios hard, but ho can't get
none. He's in a streak of bad luck."
"Well, then, why not get. him to take
care of the baby while you go out to
work?"
The mother's face is a study. "He
wouldn't do it, ma'am. He don't like
babies much, and this one is uncommonly
cross 'long of bavin the thrash. Is. r.
Pheoblo never wi; ; no hand at tendin
round the house matters."
The nurse engages to see if some ar
rangement cannot be made by which the
baby may be taken care of and the mother
loft at liberty to work.
"I hope you ladies will excuse things,'
says Mrs. l'heeble, cheering tip a bit and
glancing around her very disorderly aparr
ment. "I ain't had no heart to clean up
none yet today."
And very likely she had not. There was
that in the air of the stuffy apartment cal
culated to strangle impulse of any kind
except the almost irresistible desire to
lling some of tho superfluous tidies and
gimcracks out of tho window or into the
stove, to wash tho placb, give the wailing
baby a bath and somo fresh clean w rap
pings, scrub tho pasty faced boy likewist
and pin a shawl round him and sot him
out in the sunny alloy where 1:; n.ij.l.t
breathe somo pure air. But the thougut
arose, how could the woman do this each
day with the only available water fathoms
below her flight of stairs and an irate
landlady urging her for rent and threaten
ing expulsion unless it was forthcoming
"But she'll surely not turn you out in
such bitter weather as this," says the
nurse. "She shan't do it."
Baby's mother shakes her head, uncon
vinced. "I couldn't wonder if she did,"
she admits. "Accordln to tho landlady's
story, she's got this big house rented on
her hands, a> d if she ain't able to pay her
landlord wht 1 ho comes round he ain't
goin to ask . reasons why her money ain't
ready. 1 owe her three months' rent now,
'count of ba\ in been sick so mir !i o!T and
on and the bi.by comin just in tho midst
of Mr. Phceble's bad streak of luck. It
seems like one gets more and more behind
hand instead of goin forward, and the
landlady's patience is most to the end "
Tho yisitojs say encouraging words ami
promise that by tho next day or tho day
after succor shall comB in one form or an
other.
