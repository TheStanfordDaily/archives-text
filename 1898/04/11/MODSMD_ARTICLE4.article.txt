# DECISION AGAINST US.
## Arbitration Board Hands Down an Adverse Decision in the Bicycle Dispute. 
### 
As previously announced, the dis
agreement, between Track Man
agers Gregory of Stanford and J)oz
ier of the University of California
over the time of holding the intercol
legiate bicycle race was submitted to
arbitration. Stanford favored hold
ing ii on the day of the Field-day
as heretofore and U. C. desired for
certain reasons to hold it the Wed
nesday before. The result was in
favor of Berkeley.
Charles I'. Eelle, president of the
University Club of San Francisco,
was requested to appoint a com
mittee of three, as provided in the
intercollegiate arbitration agree
ment. The gentlemen appointed
to settle the matter were Mr. Sam
uel Knight, a Vale graduate, and
Messrs. A. J. Dibblee and Hall
McAllister, Harvard graduates.
The committee met Saturday
morning in Mr. Eell's oflice in the
Mills building and heard the rep
resentatives of the two universities,
Managers Gregory and Dozier. The
committee after due deliberation
announced their decision, that the
race be held the Wednesday before
the Field-day at San Jose. The
committee, however, were also of
the opinion that if the track for
holding the race were in San Fran
cisco the race should have been
held the same day; but as it would
inconvenience those who wished to
attend both events, if held on the
same day at different places, the
decision was given as above. The
decision practically admits the
justice of the Stanford position,
although the lack of a suitable
track in San Francisco gave Berke
ley the decision.
