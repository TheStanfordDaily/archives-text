The loss of the baseball game
after the steadiness of the first in
nings of play was a surprise, hut
the lessons learned during the
game are worth the price, how
ever loth we are to pay for them in
such coin. Eight innings of good
ball were lost by errors in one in
ning, ihe most critical during the
game. Even after that all hope
was not gone, and the men made a
plucky attempt to redeem them
selves, hut it was impossible to get
a batting rally. The batting was
encouraging, but the hits were
scattered, making them valueless
for the purposes of run getting.
The team showed they have the
making of a victorious nine, and
this week's training, if directed at
the weakest places of the play,
should see such a consummation-
We can not say the team is superior
to California'*. A superior team
does not go to pieces, but we think
our material is superior, and there
is no reason why the team should
not be so in the next game.
We should remember that Stan
ford won the first game last year
and lost the series. The loss of
the first game should be an incen
tive to the team and to the student
body for greater efforts toward vic
tory. The support given in Satur
day's giime was good, and we
should not he so far lacking in
sportsmanlike qualities as to with
draw it after a defeat. We expect
hard work from the team, and we
count on the student body to re
double its attendance at practices
and at the next game in the city.
