# STANFORD IN THE CITY.
## Alumni of San Francisco Issue a Directory of the Growing Stanford Colony. 
### 
A directory for "San Francisco's
Stanford Colony" lias just been is-
Bued. It contains the names of 151
persons formerly attending the
University and now residing in the
city.
The list is divided into two parts:
"Regular Alumni of Stanford,"
under which there are seventy
names, and "Those fora time at
Stanford," under which there are
eighty-one names. Numerically
the different class groups are rep
resented as follows: Ex-teacher, 2;
P. G., 3; ex-P. (J., 1; '92, 1; '94, 5;
ex-'94, 5; '95, 29; ex-'95, 29; '96,
19; ex-'96, 10; '97, 18; ex '97, 13;
ex-98, 6; ex-'99, 8; ex-'OO, 5;
ex-'Ol, 2.
As a matter of interest and as a
model whereby useful lists may he
compiled by other Stanford col
onies, a part of this directory, that
pertaining to the graduates of the
Pioneer Class, is herewith repub
lished. Space prevents the publi
cation of the whole record, though
it is far more entertaining than
might at first be supposed.
Although the column headed
•'Profession" is not in all cases
complete, it shows that there are
28 lawyers, 5 machinists, 5 jour
nalists, 4 teachers, 4 electricians, 3
physicians, 2 electrical engineers,
2 civil engineers, 2 mining engi
neers, 2 chemists, 2 artists, 1 geol
ogist, 1 mechanical engineer, 1 ed
itor, 1 architect, 1 professional
nurse, 18 students of law, medi
cine, dentistry, and architecture, 2
insurance men, and over twenty
other different occupations.
Sixteen Creek-letter fraternities
are represented by a total of fifty
three members, as follow: Sigma
Nu 12, Sigma 11 ho Eia 9, Zeta I'si
7, Delta Tau Delta 4, Phi Kappa
Psi 4, Sigma Alpha Epsilon 3, Phi
Delta Theta 2, Kappa Alpha 2,
Beta Theta Pi 2, Phi Gamma Delta
2, Sigma Chi 1, Alpha Tau Omega
1, Chi Phi 1, Alpha Delta Phi 1,

Kappa Alpha Theta 1, Kappa
Kappa Gamma 1.
So far, sin e leaving college,
about 7 per cent, of the 138 men
have married, while over 30 per
cent, of the thirteen women already
have husbands. Those on the mar
ried list are: Crossett and Tilden.
ex-'94; Applewhite, Guth, and
Stuart, '95; Ewell, Gray, Miss
Hentrich, Itosenfeld, and Miss
Grace Smith, ex-'95; Miss Mc-
Laughlin, '96; Miss Murray, ex-'9B:
and Jordan, ex-'99.
The purpose and value of such a
directory, especially in the means
of closer intercourse suggested by
the telephone numbers, is evident,
on its face. It should also make
possible the gathering together of
resident alumni and former stu
dents upon the occasion of any
Stanford affair in San Francisco.
A hope expressed by the publica
tion committee is that with this
San Francisco county Stanford di
rectory as a rough outline a similar
list may soon be compiled in every
county in California in which
there is "a streak of cardinal"; so
that, in a few months, the material
may be collected in San Francisco
for the first issue of a State direc
tory, arranged alphabetically by
counties and by towns in counties,
printed in a convenient little
pocket booklet and issued at the
least possible expense. To perfect
t is plan the committee recom
mended that free copies of the San
Francisco directory lie sent to rep
resentative Stanford men in differ
ent parts of California, at Harvard,
Columbia, Johns Hopkins, and
other universities, and in Portland,
Seattle, Denver, Chicago, and other
places where there may be material
fora future Stanford club.
