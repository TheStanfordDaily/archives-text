Thk bogie found in I he quad
rangle yesterday morning does not
merit the amount of discussion
which it has received in student
circles. Pretending to satirize the
workings of a faculty committee
which deals with student affairs,
its evident malice destroys all its
effectiveness and creates exactly
the opposite impression from the
one intended. Bogies have out
lived thei r usefulness at Stanford.
Wit, the prime essential fora suc
cessful bogie, has been lacking in
those of late years, so that every
one supposed the custom had died
out of its own accord, when yester
day morning the result of an at
tempt to revive it was discovered.
The present bogie bears ear
marks of composition by some dis
gruntled individual, evidently liv
ing in •Jexile from the University
through some action of his own
which did not meet the approval
of the committee satirized. We
know nothing of the methods of
the committee; we only know that
a man acting as a gentleman will
never come under its jurisdiction.
Anonymous attacks like the present
one are wrong in principle. A man
making attacks behind the cover of
a bogie is a coward; if he were not,
why seek its protection? If any
one wishes to criticize the faculty
let him be man enough to do it
over his signature. We have con
fidence that the men of the faculty
are broad-minded enough to brook
criticism tendered in the right
spirit.
We deprecate the conjecture that
a University student would stoop
to such blackguardly use of the lit
tle literary power he possesses, and
the students who have been instru
mental in starting rumors that the
bogie is the work of University stu
dents prominent in the student
body, are deserving of the severest
censure unless they can substan

tiate them. On dit is usually the
cloak fora lie, and any one repeat
ing such dicta at such a time
makes himself a party to the un
truth. The matter has gone so far
that we hope the real author, or
authors, may he found and his
name and those of his accomplices
made public.
