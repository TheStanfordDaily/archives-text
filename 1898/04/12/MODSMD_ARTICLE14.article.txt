### 
The '99 Annual will be on sale
the thirtieth of this month. A very
neat poster announcing this fact
has been placed around the quad.
Manager Greenebaum, when in
terviewed today, made the following
statement: "1 am very glad to say
that the book is nearly ready for
the binders. From present indica
tions the book will be a success, as
nearly all of the books have al-|
ready been ordered. Those who de
sire to have a copy, and have not
as yet subscribed, had better do so
before long, as there are but one
hundred and thirty-two books that
are not subscribed for. It would
confer a great favor on me if sub
scribers would get their books early,
as non-subscribers can not get their
books for sure until subscribers are
furnished with the same. I think
the editor and I can guarantee that
the '99 Quad will be in many re
spects superior to the previous An
nuals, and all we hope is that they
will meet with the approval of the
college at large."
