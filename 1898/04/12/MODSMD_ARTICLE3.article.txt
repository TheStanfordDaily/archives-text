# ACCIDENT TO DOLE.
## Injury to One of the Best Athletes of the Varsity Track Team Last Evening. 
### 
If Stanford had her choice in
laying off any member of the track
team she would have let any man
go before Charlie Dole. And now
that Dole is confined to his room
with an injured leg our hopes of
winning have become very faint in
deed. Dole wrenched a large mus
cle in the upper part of his leg
while practicing the high jump last
night. How badly he is hurt can
not be ascertained for three or four
days.
When seen in his room today
Dole said: "1 will be unable to do
any more work before the Field-day.
I shall carefully nurse my leg until
then and if I am able I shall enter
and do what I can. I may be able
to do as well as I have done before,
but it is very uncertain, as this
wrench may come back at the first
trial."
