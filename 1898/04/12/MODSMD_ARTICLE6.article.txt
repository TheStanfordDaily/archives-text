# Varsity Game Tomorrow.
## 
### 
The Garden City Gun Club base
ball team will play the Varsity on
the campus tomorrow afternoon at
2:30 o'clock. The San Jose Club
will bring up the same team that
the Varsity defeated a month ago,
with the exception of Doyle who is
no longer a member of the San Jose
team. Arrick will pitch for the
visitors and Lanagan will be in
the box for Stanford.
The game will be good practice
not only for the team but also the
"rooters."
