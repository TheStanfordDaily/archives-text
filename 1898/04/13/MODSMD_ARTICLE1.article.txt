# LECTURE ON AGASSIZ.
## President Jordan Spoke Last Evening on the Life and Character of the Scientist. 
### 
Those who attended the lecture
last evening enjoyed the rare treat
of hearing one great teacher speak
in glowing terms of another, Louis
Agassiz, from whom Dr. Jordan, his
youngest pupil, gained much of his
love for science.
"Agassiz," said Dr. Jordan, "was
a French Swiss whose ancestors had
been driven out of France and had
established a line of Calvinistic
clergymen which Louis Agassiz was
the first to break." As a young
boy he had a great interest in all
living things. He once wrote to his
father: "It is my ambition to be a
good son, a good citizen, and the
first naturalist of my time." He
did this and more, for he became
the second naturalist of all time.
At the wish of his father he
studied medicine at the Univer
sity of Munich which, at the time
when he took his degree, was the
greatest university in Europe be
cause it hud the greatest teachers.
The professors were the friends of
the students as well as their in
structors, and Agassiz' room was
visited by such men as IHilinger,
the founder of the science of embry
ology.
Agassiz next became a professor
himself in a small institution at
Neuehatel, which under his influ
ence became the center of great
scientific activity. His next move
was to Paris, where he studied fossil
fishes and worked in the reptile
room in the Jardin des 1 lantes.
"Xhese little rooms," said the lec
turer, ''have been the Mecca of sci
entific devotees. The spirits of
great naturalists still haunt their
corridors and speak from the labels
of specimens they have arranged."
Agassiz came to America, liked
it, and stayed. He liked the Amer
ican freedom, hope, and optimism.
As a professor at Harvard his un
wonted scientific activity aroused
much uneasiness and some jealousy.
As a teacher Agassiz did what few
in his time knew enough to do. He
taught science by making it vital.
He made little use of books him
self, and refused the most flattering
offers from publishers to write books.
To one such offer lie replied: "I
have no time to make money."
In 1872 Agassiz established a
summer school at Penakese, a
small island donated for the pur
pose a few miles out from New Bed
ford. Hither came the fifty men
and women he chose from the many
applicants, among them Jordan,
who had already been studying
fishes under him. None who were
there will ever forget that now fam
ous session at Penakese. The cen
tral figure Dr. Jordan describes as
"tall, with a rolling walk, gray
hair, and a beaming smile." Such
was the teacher's earnestness and
enthusiasm that the students were
made to feel that they were in a
sense missionaries. Nature was to
bring them back to the truth, and
they were to take the truth to men.
"That year," said the lecturer in
closing, "he died. He had been a
student all his life long, and when
he died he was younger than any
of us."
