Among the several editorials
bearing on matters of interest to
Stanford there is one which is es
pecially so. It tilled a page for the
editor of the Occident, but we can
show the general tone and senti
ment by quoting extracts. The
editor had been writing about
Stanford for half a page or so
when he reached the part of the
editorial we refer to, and he was in
full tilt from the momentum of his
previous two hundred words —end-
ing "uncourteous in the extreme."
To quote:
"They seek success in a tortuous
and ridiculous machiavellistn which
is exasperating. This deplorable
tendency is evidenced in the method
by which they seek to deprive us
of one of our best athletes. Stan
ford University is going to protest
Kay Carroll at the next P. A. A.
meeting. This threat is not of a
nature to affright us into hyster
ios." [?]
The editor then tells in his own
inimitable style what Carroll is do
ing by virtue of which he is not a
professional. To proceed:
"In protesting an amateur of
such unquestionable purity, what
has Stanford in view? What ad
vantage is it seeking?
"We would be at loss for an
answer if the very method in
which this protesting is done did
not furnish one."
Then follows a letter from Man
ager Brown of U. C. to Dole ask
ing him if this bit of "machiavel
lism" were being hatched at Stan
ford and urging him to protest
Carroll at once, so as to avoid
"newspaper notoriety. 1 ' [!]
"Mr. Dole did not answer the let
ter. At the meeting of the P. A. A.
managers held a few days later (a
month ago) he was asked by Mr.
Brown and by our representatives
to the P. A. A. to protest Mr. Car
roll there and then, so as to give
ample time for the investigation of
the charges. Mr. Dole answered
that Stanford University did not
intend to protest Carroll.
'Now that the Field-day is im
minent, now that there is no time

'
for investigating the matter thor
oughly, representatives of Stanford
University suddenly change their
mind and nnnouni e their intention
of protesting Carroll. Is this not
an answer to our question? Does
not this discover the purpose of
Stanford men in protesting Carroll?
It certainly seems so. It looks like
a deliberate attempt to besmirch
the brilliance of ou victory by
false accusations, by insidious
calumny; it looks like an endeavor
to halo the radiance of our success
with false haze of doubt and un
certainty. It is an attempt to
make our hard-won conquest un
satisfactory and questionable. It
is a proceeding unsportsmanlike,
petty, mean, and dishonest, un
worthy of a great university."
The facts of the whole matter are
these, in spite ot the editor of the
Occident: When Stanford's track
manager heard that Carroll was a
professional he was ' unsportsman
like, petty, mean" enough to at
tempt to ascertain whether there
were any grounds for the rumor.
Carroll is a gentlemanly athlete,
but there have been cases of lapses
of such men from the amateur ranks.
U. C. athletics has been tainted
with Edgrens and Sheehys. Can
any one blame the Stanford man
ager for taking due precautions?
That is his right and privilege.
When, however, it was found that
the grounds of the rumor were not
sufficient to warrant a protest, that
was the end of it. Mr. Dole was
acting under instructions when he
refuse to accede to Mr. Brown's
earnest request to ''protest Mr.
Carroll there and then," and he
told the truth —inconceivable as
I
that may seem to the editor of the
Occident —when he said that Stan
ford did not intend to protest Car
roll. Stanford did not intend to
protest Carroll, has not at this
writing protested him, and will
not. We hope that this will sat
isfy the bellicose editor of our sin
cerity, and we also hope that his
futile attempts to cast odium on
the athletics of Stanford University
and on one of the most gentle
manly athletes that can be found
in this or any other university—
even California —will also cease,
as being utterly baseless and savor
ing, as Mr. Crawford would say,,
of the "sour indigestion of free |
thought."
We appreciate the necessity the!
editor is under to (ill his editorial
tpace, but on the whole we approve
of his recent experiment in run
ning his page a blank, as being a
proceeding less "unsportsmanlike,
petty, mean, and dishonest, un
worthy of a great university" than
his present effort.
No, the "radiance of their suc
cess" is and ever shall be unhaloed
"with the false haze of doubt and
uncertainty."
