# A 						NEW PROFESSOR.
## C.A. Copeland, '95, Appointed Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering. 
### 
President Jordan announced to
day that Mr. Clement A. Copeland
of Los Angeles has been appointed
to fill Professor Perrine's place
while he is absent on leave.
Mr. Copeland entered with the
"Pioneer Class" of Stanford from
San Diego, making Electrical
Engineering his major subject.
This department at that time not
being fully developed, on the ad
vice of his professors he went to
Cornell University, where he grad
uated with the class of 1896 in
Electrical Engineering. Since grad
uating he has been engaged in elec
trical work. He stands very high
as a practical electrician, and has
in addition a thorough knowledge
of electrical theory and- mathemat
ical physics He will have the
rank of Assistant Professor of Elec
trical Engineering, doing the work
of the department under the gen
eral direction of Professor Perrine,
who will retain his residence in
Palo Alto and will visit the Uni
versity from time to time, giving
lectures and advising in the work
of the department.
Professor Perrine has not re
signed his chair. He is simply re
lieved for two years from active
University work in order that he
may take the important position of
consulting expert of the Blue Lake
Water and Electrical Power Com
pany with headquarters in San
Francisco. His selection for this
most important position, involving
attempts never yet made in electri
cal science, is a very great compli
ment to the University and will be
of the greatest value to the stu
dents of Electrical Engineering in
Stanford University, even though
they be deprived for the time being
of his active help.
