# HELP TOWARD VICTORY.
## Plans for Tomorrow Evening's Baseball Rally and the Rooting for the Game. 
### 
Stanford attributed her defeat in
the first game of the baseball series
last Saturday to hard luck. Even
Berkeley admits that the Stanford
nine is the stronger aggregation.
In the words of a U. C. man: "We
won the game by good luck and
superior rooting." That the Stan
ford nine is a strong team no one
can deny, and such a team with
proper backing and good luck can
never lose the championship, a
championship that was born at
Stanford in the good old days of
'95 and is in a fair way to come
home again.
As to superior rooting. It has
always been a matter of comment
in San Francisco that a small num
ber of spirited Stanford rooters can
overcome five times their number
of blue and gold adherents, The
only question is to get the men to
the city. In view of the fact that
this is really the deciding game of
the series it behooves every Stan
ford man to go to the city and see
that the nine lacks 110 support.
Considering the time and work that
the baseball men have given to
ward a possibility of victory, it is a
small matter for those who are
bound to support them to give one
afternoon and a small amount of
money in appreciation of their
work and for the glory of victory.
There ought to be a delegation of
five hundred strong at the game.
If men have not the money to 50
by train and can not borrow it, it
seems that those who have wheels
could enjoy the ride to the city in
the bicycle company that will go
next Saturday tc root for victory,
leaving Encina at 9 a.m. sharp.
As to luck. That is a matter
easily disposed of. In other words
the baseball hoodoo will be burned
at the stake tomorrow night at 8
o'clock in the outfield of the base
ball diamond. The hoodoo has
been located and will be on hand
to take the leading role of the cere
mony. Speeches will be made by |
professors, the baseball men, and
prominent students. With the
hoodoo out of the way and a large
following of rooters, willing to root
from the first ball to the last one,
the team can go to the city Satur
day morning conscious of its
strength and willing to apply it.
