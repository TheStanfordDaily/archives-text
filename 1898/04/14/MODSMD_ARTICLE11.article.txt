# The
						Student Vote.

The Palo Alto [Ave Oak has the
following editorial in the current
issue:
"There is some dissatisfaction
among students in regard to the
stringent rules prescribed in the
matter of registration. They feel
that they are entitled to a resi
dence here, especially those who
have not a permanent home else
where. Most of such students are
away during the summer, going
wherever they can earn money,
and unless they register here they
are disfranchised.
"The students are certainly en
titled to a vote somewhere, and
there would seem to he no just
reason why they should he denied
the privilege in their college town,
if the laws are the cause of this de
fect they should he changed. The
student vote is not an unsafe one,
for young men who have the edu
cation to enter a university or col
lege are the kind of men who make
good citizens."
The Live Oak also says in an
other column:
"The ratio that is supposed to
exist between the number of voters
in a town and its population does
not apply in Palo Alto. Instead
of a ratio of five to one it is here
nearly ten to one on account of the
large student and other transient
population. The figure for Palo
Alto probably exceeds two thou
sand, not including the Univer
sity."
