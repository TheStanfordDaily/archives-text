The directory of the San Fran
cisco alumni and students fora
time at Stanford, which has jn-1
been published, from which we have
printed extracts, should be nol
only a means of binding closer to
gether the Stanford interests in the
city, but also an example fur like
action by the alumni of other
cities. In many there are already
flourishing Stanford clubs, and if
each would publish inexpensive di
rectories of their district, which
could later be incorporated into a
larger directory of the State, as is
the intention in California, the re
sult would he to help keep alive
the Stanford spirit in every local
ity, and also to make possible
pleasant meetings between travel
ing Stanford people and local
alumni, or former students.
