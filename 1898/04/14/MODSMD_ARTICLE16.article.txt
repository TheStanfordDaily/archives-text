Although the Garden City Gun
Club nine was easy prey for the
Varsity yesterday, it gave our nine
some good practice in batting and
base-running, and showed the few
who watched the game that our
team is playing in excellent form.
Every Stanford man believes that
our nine is superior to Berkeley's â€”
and yet we have lost the first game
of the series. Hut that was hard
luck, and steps have been taken to
prevent a repetition of last Satur
day's score. The hoodoo will make
his last appearance at a holocaust
on the diamond tomorrow evening.
We will then have a team which is
superior to Berkeley in the knowl
edge of baseball and in the ability
to play the game, and which can
not be deprived of victory by any
hoodoo, for the hoodoo goes up in
smokeat'the Big Base Hall Bonfire.
But there is still one more thing
needed, and we will have that.
Berkeley realizes that with a
team wenker than ours they have
won one half of a baseball victory
for 18 I JB and that if they can get
either one of the next two games

it's all over for this year. Last
year Princeton won the champion
ship in the East by "rooting."
Their team was strong and weak
in the same places that ours in,
but they made up their minds
that they would not iose, and vic
tory was theirs.
The entire student body of U. C.
will be in the grandstand next
Saturday, and, knowing that we
will win unless our team receives
poorer support than theirs, they
will shout from the time the game
is called until it is won. We must
have five hundred Stanford sup
porters packed together shouting
as we have not shouted since we
won the game last Thanksgiving
