# Good Chances for Victory.

### 
Coach Sheehan, when asked lo
talk on our chances of winning the
next baseball game, paid: I< l am
confident that we will win. Our
superior batting and the confidence
the team has in itself will carry
them through to victory. Every
man of them is going in the game
to win—and even a freshman knows
what happens when a Stanford
team goes into a contest with that
spirit.
"I am sure the team will not go
to pieces again as they did in that
fatal fourth inning of last Saturday's
game. There will he a change in
the batting order which will prove
of material aid in getting runs.
"To sum up in a nut-shell: Our
men can hit Berkeley's pitcher and
Berkeley can not find our pitchers.

The balance lies with the rooters.
If Berkeley 'out-roots' us, she may
win. I hope to see a large crowd
of Stanford men in the grandstand
next Saturday."
