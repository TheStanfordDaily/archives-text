### 
The first intercollegiate tennis
match will be played the morning
of April '23, thus bringing another
intercollegiate event on that day.
0. S. Picher, '138, the Stanford
champion, has not as yet a run
ning mate, as the usual prelimi
nary tournament has not been
held.
Interest in tennis is almost dead
at the University. The Tennis
Club has passed out of existence,
and the student body has not yet
assumed control of the courts. At
the next meeting of the Executive
Committee W. C. McNeil, presi
dent of the Tennis Club before it
went out of existence, will request
the student body to assume charge
of the courts and also to take
charge of the preliminaries. The
apathy at Stanford is in decided
contrast to the enthusiasm at Berk
eley.
O. S. Picher is in every respect
an intercollegiate player. Of late
he has been practicing on the Cal
ifornia Club courts, and left this
week for the tournament at Ojai
between the Northern and Southern
California champions, Picher play
ing with the latter.
