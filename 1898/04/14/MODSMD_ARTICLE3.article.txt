# Today's Practice.
## 
### 
A fair crowd was out to witness
this evening's practice, it being the
last practice game of the team be
fore meeting Berkeley. In the first
inning the second team went out in
one-two-three order. The Varsity
followed suit. In the second on
Havens' hit and Klaubers' error it
looked as if the aecond team would
score, but good fielding of infield
hits shut them out. For the Var
sity Beckett led off with a hit, took
second on a wild pitch, and stole
third, but was caught at home on
Murphy's \iit to third.
Murphy scored on Harris' hit
and Chandler's error. Harris
scored 011 Havens' error.
In the third Bentley hit safe,
but was put out at second. Russ
and Chandler fanned. In the last
of the third Lanagan struck out.
Lougheed was retired 011 a hit to
second, and Strohn reached first on
Crandall's error. Wight followed
with a hit, advancing Strohn to
third. Strohn and Wight scored
on Beckett's hit to left. Beckett
took third on Young's two-bagger,
and both scored on Murphy's hit
and Wrigley's error. Murphy stole
to third, and scored on Crandall's
fumble of Harris' hit. Harris was
put out at second.
Score, 7 to 0 in favor of the Var
sity. The practice, on the whole,
was encouraging.
