# AID FROM THE FACULTY.
## Entertainment to Assist the Student Body to Purchase the Choral Piano. 
### 
The work of the different clubs
which are going to take part in the
entertainment to be given on the
sixth of next month in Encina
gymnasium "for the piano" is. pro
gressing encouragingly. If the
student body supports as it ought
the members of the faculty who
are helping it to retain possession
of the piano in the chapel, a large
sum will be turned into the treas
urj\ All the members of the
various clubs who will assist are
in "hard training," and the enter
tainment will undoubtedly be the
biggest hit of the peason, despite
the unprecedented success of the
'98 shows.
Mrs. M. R. Smith, Mrs. Branner,
and Mrs. Jordan have charge of
the program. The three princi
pal clubs taking part are
are the Faculty Dramatic Club,
the Faculty Musical Club, and the
Symphony Club. The Dramatic
Club scored its first success at the
Kirmess. It members do not hope
to surpass what they did then, but
under the able direction of Stage
Manager Nash they are determined
to demonstrate that that was not
any better than they can do again.
The Symphony Club is continuing
practice under Professor Young.
The Musical Club comprises all the
singers in the faculty, of whom
there is no dearth.
The entertainment is to be given
under the auspices of the student
body by members of the faculty
who are desirous of helping the stu
dent body pay the rest of the money
due on the piano, purchased and
paid for in part by the now defunct
Choral Society. It was felt that
there is a need fora piano in the
chapel, and the members of the fac
ulty expressed a willingness to con
tribute toward making its posses
sion possible. So that outside of
the merits of the entertainment, its
very purpose insures the hearty
support of the student body.
