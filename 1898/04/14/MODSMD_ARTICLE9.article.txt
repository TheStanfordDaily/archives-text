# Last Night's Show.
## 
### 
A rather small but very enthus
iastic audience greeted the per
formers in last night's '98 benefit
entertainment, and showed ap
preciation of the excellent pro
gram.
Miss J agger's solos were excep
tionally well rendered, her encore
being particularly good. Mr. Dul
ley furnished the violin obligato
for both selections. Miss Hyde's
recitations were well received and
richly deserved their encore. J. S.
Briscoe was as funny as ever, al
though he did tell a story given be
fore in a similar entertainment. F.
A. Corbusier's whistling solo, ''The
Mocking Bird", with his own guitar
accompaniment, brought as an en
core a very clever piece of ventrilo
quism that brought down the house.
Miss Effa Kuns showed great elo
cutionary power and range in her
different selections,nndMiss Dinkel
speil's "Non ti scordar di me?" was
an earnest effort that was greatly
appreciated. M. P. Waite's cornet
solo showed a lack of preparation
but was in a measure redeemed by
the encore. 11. S. Fleming's piano

solo, and the songs of Rodolph and
Van Kaathoven were well received.
Indeed the audience was so en
thusiastic that it did the unusual
thing of encoring the last piece on
the program, a mandolin, banjo,
guitar sextette, and remained seated
until another selection was given.
The management cleared about
$25 for the class.
