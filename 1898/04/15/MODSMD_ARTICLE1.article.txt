# LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE.
## Excellent Showing Made by the Six Speakers in the Inter-Society Contest. 
### 
The regular annual debate for
the championship of the Inter-
Society Debating League was held
in the chapel last evening, E. H.
Kothrock, '98, presiding. The au
dience, though not large, was very
appreciative. The question for
discussion was "Resolved, That
football, as it is now played, is un
desirable as a college sport." The
affirmative was upheld by a team
of six representatives —one speaker
from each of the contesting soci
eties — while the negative depended
upon a series ot live one-minute ex
temporaneous speeches alter each
affirmative effort. Each affirma
tive speaker was allowed live min
utes and one minute for rebuttal.
Carl Hayden, '00, of Philolexia
led for the affirmative by stating
that the question included football
as played by professional teams and
athletic clubs and that it was not
Stanford football to which the af
firmative objected. Brutality in
lootbali was of two kinds, inten
tional and unavoidable. The rules
were not properly enforced against
the former and the latter could
only be stopped by making the
game more open, 'ihe reform and
not the abolition of football was
the affirmative's contention. In re
buttal it was urged that lootbali
was no more inherently brutal than
other sports and that less men died
from its effects than from any other
sport.
Miss A. L. Andrews, '99, of the
Saturday Night Club, in a neat
speech explained how only very
lew students received any benetu
from the exercise of lootbali, and
these were the ones who needed it
the least, the rest being compelled
by the force of public opinion to
waste time which might be more
prolitably employed in their own
physical development. The objec
tion was raised by the negative
that the excitement of a football
was a relaxation from the monot
ony of university work, and hence
very beneficial.
A. H. Suzzallo, '00, of Euphronia
spoke of the great excitement and
high nervous tension of games held
in the large cities and the conse
quent betting and dissipation on
the part of the students.
The negative held that political
campains were worse in this regard
than football, and that the great
games of the East were not played
in the cities but upon the college
campuses.
Mr. Suzzallo had a good delivery
and his rebuttal speech was ex
ceptionally strong.
The next affirmative speaker was
M. A. Morris, '01, of Leland, who
dwelt upon the extravagance and
waste of football, both upon the
players and by the students. Yale
and Harvard each spent over
$50,000 last year upon this game
alone The fact that football pays
for itself and all our other sports
was the main argument of the neg
ative.
Professionalism was the topic of
the Alpha representative, L. B.
Wickersham, '00. He cited numer

ous instances in the East, and in
sisted that comparisons should not
be drawn from Stanford Univer
sity, for here football is at its
purest and best.
The negative showed that the
rules were strictly enforced against
professional! football everywhere,
and that professional teams were
unpopular'
The last speaker for the affirma
tive was C. S. Chandler, '99, of
Nestoria. He maintained that
football is more of a passion than
a recreation and that many plain
people keep their sons away from
college on account of the evil re
sults of football.
The negative illustrated its point
by showing the year after our 20-0
game the Freshman Class was ex
ceptionally large.
The judges, Professors Spencer,
Duniway, and Durand, decided
that the affirmative team as a whole
had upheld its contention and that
Mr. Suzzalo was the best of those
who spoke upon the team.
