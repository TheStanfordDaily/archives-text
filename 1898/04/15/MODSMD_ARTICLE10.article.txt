With only a week before the in
tercollegiate tennis games, ;i de
plorable state of affairs exists at
Stanford. No tournament has
held, and there is only one man in
championship form. The Tennis
Club is defunct, and the student
body has not yet taken charge of
the courts, nor appointed a manager
for tennis interests. The condition
of the University courts renders
good play almost impossible. It
would be hard to locate the re
sponsibility for such a state of
affairs, as the system of tennis
management at Stanford was never
under the control of the student
body authorities, but in the hands
of the tennis men themselves. The
Executive Committee should ap
point a temporary manager for the
present season, and the committee
on amendments to the student
body constitution would do well to
devise some way in which tennis
could be managed just as eMi -
ciently as the other sports. The
courts should be kept by the stu
dent body and should be open to
the use of every student alike.
