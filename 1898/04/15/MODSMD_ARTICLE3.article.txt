# TOMORROW'S GAME.
## Prospects and Plans for the Second Match of the Intercollegiate Baseball Series. 
### 
The Varsity is to play the sec
ond game of the intercollegiate
series tomorrow afternoon at three
o'clock at Recreation Park, San
Francisco. The team has been
hard at work all week, and to the
delight of the large crowd of "fans"
that has witnessed each nightly
practice, has been improving in
all points of the game. It certainly
appears as if the defeat of Saturday
will be retrieved in a victory tomor
row.
Captain Lougheed when seen
this afternoon said: "1 would like
to be conservative, because at best
baseball is an uncertain game but
I think we stand a better show than
ever against Berkeley. Our fielding
game has improved during the past
week, and the errors will be scat
tered throughout the game. It has
been bunched errors that have lost
games for us this year. Berkeley
fields better than we do, but we are
handier with the stick.
"It is desirable to have the play
ers' bench reserved exclusively for
the players and the coach, and I
make this request."
It is expected that a large num
ber of students will go to the game.
Stanford rooters will be directed
where to sit upon reaching the

cina tomorrow morning at 9, at
which time the team also departs.
