# The 						New Restaurant.

### 
The new University restaurant
which is now being erected east of
the quad range will be completed
about July 1, when it will probably
be inspected by caterers who desire
to rent it. The structure will be
one story high with an attic, but it
is built so that another story can
be added if the project pioves suc
ceksful. It will consist of the main
building, seventy feet long and
forty feet wide, which is divided
into a large dining room, fifty by
forty feet, capable of accommoda
ting about a hundred persons,
and two private dining rooms, each
twenty by twenty feet, and an
annex in the rear, forty by thirty
nine feet, for the kitchen. The
building will face directly north,
and a veranda twelve feet wide,
arched and supported by columns
similar to the arcade of the quad
rangle will run across the front

and the entire length of the two
Bides.
When opened the restaurant will
be run on the regular restaurant
plan, meals being served at all
prices from ten cents up. It is
built mainly with the idea of ac
commodating students at such low
rates that there will be no induce
ment for them to live away from
the campus because of a difference
in the price of board. Mrs. Stan
ford hopes that this, together with
the added social advantages offered
by the transformation of the En
cina dining room into a club room,
will be the means of greatly in
creasing the number of roomers, if
not entirely tilling the hall.
