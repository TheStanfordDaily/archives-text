Those who attend the baseball
game tomorrow must, nut in their
enthusiasm forget, the second team,
the team that did so much to make
victory possible. To the batteries
especially is great credit due, as
their share of the work i- the most
exacting and the least showy.
Stanford has as much, even more,
cause to lie proud of the second
nine as of the second eleven, for
day after day, faithfully, un
tiringly, and conscientiously, the
baseball men have played hard
and to the silence of empty
bleachers. Football received de
served applause; baseball has not.
