THE EQUITABLE LIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY
OF THE UNITED STATES
120 Broadway, New York Organised 1859
January I, 1898
The Largest, Strongest, Most Popular, Thoroughly Mutual, and Economically Managed Life Insurance Company in the World
of the premiums paid, with interest ;it rates between 6
and 7 per cent, per Annum.
The Kijuitable Society has a SURPLUS of $50,543,175, anil is the strongest lire
assurauce company in the world. This is a point of the first importance, since
life assurance contracts may not mature for many years after they have been
entered into by the contracting parties
The advantage enjoyed by the Kqultable Society in consequence of its large
surplus and superior tlnanciai strength deserves, at this time, special attention
for another reason: the Society now offers to the assuring pubiic a new form of
policy, whose most striking characteristic is that a great number of exceed
ingly valuable and deiinite OUARANTKKS are embodied in the contract. Any
guarantee made by a company with a surplus exceeding FIFTY MILLION
DOLLARS is obviously worth more than would be the promise of a company of
limited resources, or of one whose management had been such as to impair its
tlnanciai strength.
