# A 						CARDINAL TRIUMPH.
## Second Baseball Game of the Series Won by the Stanford Nine, Score 12 to 2. 
### 
The first intercollegiate victory
of this semester was won Saturday
when the Varsity nine met their
blue and gold rivals on the Recrea
tion Park diamond. The Stanford
team outplayed California at every
point of the game, fielding, batting,
and base-running. The cardinal
rooters out-rooted the men from
across the bay, who had come pre
pared with megaphones, fire
crackers, and other nerve torturing
instruments, but to no avail. The
Stanford runs rolled up to an even
dozen, and two solitary U. C. men
went across the plate amid enthusi
astic U. C. yelling and cries from
the Stanford section of "Only two,
Berkeley, only two." The contest
was good-natured, the only object
ionable thing being Kaarsburg's
adoption of football tactics when
Strohn crossed the home plate, with
the ball nowhere in reach.
Stanford started the run-getting
in the second inning. Young led
off with a hit and Murphy fol
lowed suit. Harris hit to McLaren,
who threw wild, letting Young
score. A double steal followed.
McCabe assisted Klauber out at
first. Swindells singled to left,
scoring Murphy and Harris.
Lougheed lined a hot one to Mc-
Cabe, who doubled out Swindells
at first.
In the third Strohn was given a
pass to first, stole round to third,
and tallied on Wight's foul out to
right.
In the fifth inning Strohn
smashed the ball to left, stole sec
ond and went to third on Mein's
overthrow. Wight struck out.
Beckett popped a fly to short.
Young hit safely, bringing in
Strohn. Murphy singled. Harris
hit to McCabe, who fumbled, allow
ing the bases to till. Klauber was
hit by Kaarsburg's inshoot, forcing
Young home. Swindells stopped a
drop in like manner and Murphy
walked over the plate. This inning
marked Kaarsburg's downfall,
Sims being substituted in the
sixth.
Strohn's fly to Cheesebrough was
accepted. Wight got a base on
balls. Beckett was hit by "Wild"
Sims. With two men on bases
Young made another drive, scoring
Wight.
In the seventh Klauber reached
first on Baer's low throw to first,
was sent to second when Swindells
was hit by a pitched ball, stole
third, and tallied on a passed ball.
In the eight inning Wight
reached first safely on McCabe's
error, stole second, and scored on
Young's bit to center, Young going
to third on Hoag's throw to the
backstop. Harris singled, and
scored on an error by Bride and a
passed ball.
Berkeley sent her twain across
the plate in the eighth. With one
out Hoag hit a two-bagger to right.
Cheesebrough hit to Beckett, who
threw to catch Hoag at third,
Klauber dropping the ball. Bride
was hit by pitcher, filling the
bases. Sims hit to Beckett, who
put Hoag out at the plate. Collins
hit safely to right, letting in

Cheesebrough and Bride. Sims
was caught napping between third
and home, retiring the side.
Stanford surprised her admirers
in the improvement shown in field
ing. Several times during the
game California got men on bases
only to have them left when the
side was retired. Beckett pitched
better than in the previous game of
the series. He did not attempt to
strike out the Berkeley batters, re
lying rather upon good fielding
support. He had better control
than ever and managed to hold his
opponents down to five hits during
the game. His fielding was excel
lent.
Young played the star game of
the day. He accepted fourteen
chances, taking difficult ones with
an ease that elicited applause. Out
of five times at the bat, he hit
four times, a record that is not
easily surpassed.
Strohn held Beckett in good style
and did good work with the stick
and between bases.
Laugheed fielded well, making a
pretty catch of a fly in foul terri
tory in the sixth inning.
Swindells singled twice just when
singles were desirable. Murphy
and Harris got two hits each.
Berkeley's entire game in the
field was full of errors, their work
at the bat and on the field being
but little better. The base-running
of the Stanford men although bet
ter than before must receive not a
little attention before the next game.
The score follows:
