ford enthusiasm is being rapidly
bottled up lor next Saturday's two
contests. Wouldn't it lie well o
consider the most effective methods
of expending it? Genuine enthusi
asm, we all know, is hound to find
a vent, hut organized enthusiasm
is always most effective. ''Rah,
rah, rah," or "Give 'em the six - '
from live hundred throats goes a
good deal further than does the
same volume of sound expended in
unorganized shouting.
But yelling is not the only means
employed for showing enthusiasm.
Waving something —anything from
hat or umhrella down to a ribbon
or handkerchief —is often used as
a means of expression, especially
by women. Since we are bound to
wave something, why not organize
waving and thereby greatly in
crease its effectiveness? Why not
adopt the Chautauqua salute, sub
stituting cardinal handkerchiefs
for white ones? A Stanford section
of fluttering cardinal handker
chiefs, outdoors or in, would he a
great improvement on the hetero
geneous waving usually resorted
to, and would he appropriate on
many occasions when shouting is
out of order.
Let us and all, gel cardinal
handkerchiefs and use them Satur
day in addition to yelling to help
carry our track men and debaters
on to victory. Saturday wu*t bl
ows. A Student.
