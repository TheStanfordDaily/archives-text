Secretary G. A. Clark's lecture
tomorrow evening will be a dis
course on his own personal recol
lections of the fur seal rookeries of
the Pribylofs, and will not go into
the scientific, diplomatic, or his
toric phases of the seal question,
but will merely deal with the pic
tures presented to a wide-awake
observer of seal life. As secretary
to the Fur Seal Commission Mr.
Clark had abundant opportunity
to see the things he is to talk about,
and most of the thirty or more new
lantern slides that he will show are
made from his own snap-shot photo
graphs. Ten of the slides are made
from the original life-sketches made
by by Bristow Adams on St. Paul
Island last summer. There will
also be a number of the best pic
tures of former lectures shown,
making the evening a succession of
seal views, with commentary, ex
perience, and reminiscence by Mr.
Clark.
