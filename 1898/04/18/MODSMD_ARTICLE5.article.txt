# BURNING OF THE HOODOO.
## Rally of the Students Before Saturday's Game to Inspire the Men to Victory. 
### 
In accordance with the program
proposed in tlie Thursday evening
issue of the Daily Palo Alto, the
greatest rally ever held on the
campus was carried through Friday
night. A great demonstration had
been planned in order to show the
confidence of the student body in
the baseball men. The students as
a whole were sanguine of the
strength of the nine, and with the
proper portion of luck everybody
was? certain of an even chance for
victory. There was only one way
to get this luck. This was used,
and with the well-known result.
The Stanford hoodoo is no more,
and future teams may go to the
city to meet Berkeley, conscious
that their strength is not hampered
by bad luck.
The great rally in honor of the
team was held on the diamond in
front of the bleachers. An immense
stack of everything combustible
within reach had been made and
was touched off promptly at eight
o'clock. The roar of the flames
was accompanied by the college
yells, and a circie of over three
hundred men danced around the
great bonfire. The baseball men
in a cart rode at the head of a long
procession around the big blaze
and i alted in front of the grand
stand, where addresses were made
by Captain Lougheed, Coach Shee
han and members of the team.
►Sheehan spoke eloquently of the
old time college spirit, and in clos
ing his remarks said: ''This is the
greatest demonstration I ever wit
nessed on the campus, and is a fine
expression of that old college spirit
which was not born to die. 1 ' His
speech was cheered repeatedly and
at its close he was honored with
the Pioneer yell.
After the speechmaking was over
the master of ceremonies an
nounced the event of the evening,
the burning of the hoodoo. The
miscreant was charged with all
recent disasters to Stanford men
and teams. At the conclusion of
the charges the question was asked:
"Is he guilty or not guilty?"
"Guilty," came the answer with
a roar.
''What penalty shall the court in
its mercy inflict?'' was next asked.
"Burn him" was the clamorous
response.
The hoodoo was thrown to the
flames and with the explosion of
his giant-powder head bad luck
went and good came. After the
burning, a solemn and imposing
funeral procession was held, fol
lowed by songs and yells on the
bleachers. The result of the in
incentive to the team will be seen
by reference to another column.
