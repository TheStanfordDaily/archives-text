It has been suggested that, ;ts
university women mre by the nature
of things nimble to render their
college effective support by yelling
and cheering in intercollegiate con
tests, in the future .Stanford women
who attend these contests provide
themselves with cardinal handker
chiefs, so that when a good play is
made or when Stanford needs en
couragement they may wave the

Stanford woman who attends the
Field-day or Debate next Saturday
to provide herself with a cardinal
handkerchief or banner and to
wave it along with the cheers of the
men and thus aid in lending needed
encouragement to every Stanford
contestant.
