Thk baseball victory Saturday
was pleasant for more reasons than
the mere desire of seeing the car
dinal flaunt over the blue and gold.
It marked the first Stanford victory
of the year of 1898 which was
opened so inauspiciously by the loss
of the Carnot Debate and the Chess
Tournament. The process of chron
icling blue and gold triumphs was
becoming monotonous in the ex
treme, and we wondered when the
tide would turn in favor of the car
dinal. Friday night's rally was
spontaneous and inspiring, and un
doubtedly had a remarkable effect
on the team and the entire student
body. The support which the stu
dent body has given the nine din
ing the last two weeks has been of
the best. Never before since the
days of '95 has there been such
enthusiasm over the national game
at Stanford. We only needed de
feat for one year to make us appre
ciate our former undisputed grasp
of the championship. The team

Saturday has accomplished the first
step toward bringing it back. The
i fact also has been demonstrated
j that our team when in its best form
' is superior to California in every
j department of the game. What we
need now is to prepare carefully for
the final game. California will
play with desperation in order to i
retrieve the defeat and we shall do!
well to remember how the first j
game was lost.
The cheering at the game was '
spirited and effective. Every mini
who went up deserves the thanks
of the entire student body. If the;
team receives the same support j
during the remainder of the season,
we can rely on the men to win the
championship for Stanford.
