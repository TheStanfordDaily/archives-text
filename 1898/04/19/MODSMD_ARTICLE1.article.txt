## Literary and Scientific Works in Which Stanford Professors are Engaged. 
### 
That our professors do not find
all their energy expended in de
livering lectures and correcting
examination paperH may be judged
by the following resum6 of books
and articles for publication, all of
which may be expected to come out
under the date 1898. Numerous
other publications are projected,
but are not yet in shape for men
tion.
Professor Anderson has finished
a translation of Tonty's "Relati n
of La Salle's Discovery of the Mis
sissippi," to be published bytheCax
ton Club of Chicago.
Professor Fliigel is preparing for
Macmillan's English Comedies an
edition of Udall's "Ralph Roister
Doister," and is working at an edi
tion of Chaucer's "Minor Poems."
The latter is being worked out as a
side issue of the "Chaucer Diction
ary," and will have full critical
notes.
Professor Hudson has completed
editions of the "Vicar of Wake
field" and of the "Roger de Coverly
Papers," with introduction and
notes, for D. C. Heath Co.
Crowell is to publish a third book,
"The Study of English Literature."
Professor Newcomer has heen at
work at a "Prose Composition" of
comprehensive scope for Holt & Co.,
N. Y. He is also occupied in edit
ing selections from the "Conversa
tions" of \V. S. Landor.
Professor Duniway is working
over the thesis on which he gained
his doctor's degree at Harvard:
"Restrictions on the Freedom of
the Press."
Dr. Kriehn's studies on the social
and economic conditions of England
in the fourteenth century are being
embodied in a work entitled "The
English Social Revolt in 1381."
It will contain some 500 pages,
and will be published in England.
There are to be chapters on the
social conditions of England in the
fourteenth century, an account of
the events of the revolt in various I
phases, a chapter on the sources,
and on the "Character, Causes, and
Effects of the revolts." With re
gard to the importance of the
events in the period treated, the
author has said: "This is the chief J
social revolution of England in
the Middle Ages, the first great
conflict of capital and labor. It
was a universal uprising against
serfdom; an attempt on the part of
the poor freeman to obtain privi
leges greater than ever before pos
sessed; a rising of disconnected
cities, and a general revolt of all
towns and tenants under monastic
rule."
Professor H. R. Fairclough is
engaged on several pieces of liter
ary work. In connection with a
series of literary studies appearing
in New York, he is preparing a
volume on Creek Lyric Poetry. Dr.
Fairclough was invited to do this
work in consequence of an article
of his on the subject in Charles
Dudley Warner's "Library." He
is also engaged on an edition of
Terence's "Andrea," in connection
with a classical series under the
management of I rofessor Bennett'

of Cornell. A third work is a
volume on advanced Latin compo
sition, to appear in the Student's
Series, which is edited by I'rofessor
Pease.
Professor Pease is co-editor with.
Professor Peck of Columbia in
supervising this "Student's Series
of Latin Classics" of which
twenty-two volumes are out and
twenty-five in preparation. Pro
fessor Pease has other things on
hand as well, among them an
edition of "Cicero's Letters." In
the Classical Review he is to have
an announcement of a new manu
script of Fulgentius, exposito ser
morum antiquorum, discovered by
him last year in the British
Museum; and in the American
Journal of Philology two articles,
"The Greeting in Cicero's Letters,"
and"The Proiiounciation of Gen
itives in -i from Nouns in -ius and
-ium."'
In a recent letter to Professor
Davidson, Professor Matzke writes:
"I can point to several things ac
complished. Am at work at pres
ent on' the age of certain old
French laws attributed to William
the Conqueror."
Professor Davidson is at work
upon an edition of "Vald6s Jos6,
with introduction and notes, for D.
C. Heath & Co. He has also on
hand a "French Prose Composition"
for second-year college French or
advanced high-school work.
During the summer of 1895 when
Professor Johnston was in Italy the
third Tassian centenary was being
celebrated. Hundreds of articles
were written at that time and great
interest was taken in the study of
Tasso. Professor Johnston collected
these articles, and will combine
them into a volume with a full
bibliography and an original
critique. This year Leopardi's first
centenary is celebrated and while
in Italy this summer Professor
Johnston will prepare a companion
critique on that author.
Professor Goebel is preparing an
edition of "Hildebrand's Interpre
tations of the Songs of Goethe," also
a volume of the "Philosophical
Poems of Goethe and Schiller,"
both to be published in Germany.
Professor Mary Roberts Smith
will have an article in the Popular \
Science Monthly soon on "Education
for Domestic Life," and another in
the American Kitchen Magazine on
"Household Finance."
Turning to the scientific depart
ments, we find no less activity there.
Profesor Campbell is at work on a|
book embodying in amplified form
the lectures of his course on Evolu
tion of Plants given last semester
for the first time. Short articles
from his pen appear from time to
time, making known the data be
ing collected by him in his present
line of investigationâ€”studies of the
lower monocotyledons with a view !
to ascertaining the origin of the
flowering plants.
Dr. Gilbert is preparing for the
Bulletin of the Hopkins Labora
tory a report on "The Fishes of
Panama Bay." Two other reports
appear as bulletins of the United
States Fish Commission: "The
Fishes of the Coastwise Streams of
California andOregon," and" Report
on a Collection of Fishes from the
Columbia River." These are all to

be written more or less in collabora
tion with students in the Zoological
laboratory.
Dr. Branner has undertaken to
prepare for the United States Ge
ological Survey a report upon the
geology and technology of the clay
and kaolin deposits of Arkansas.
It will make a book of four hun
dred pages with maps and illustra
tions. He will also publish an
illustrated article on "Stone Reefs
of Brazil." During the vacation
he will prepare and have printed a
syllabus of his lectures on el
ementary geology. Some time
during the year Dialect Notes will
issue a paper by him upon some
old French names in the State of
Arkansas. He has also in prepa
ration a paper upon the physiog
raphy of Arkansas and another
upon the zinc of that State.
Professor J. P. Smith is writing
for the Journal of Morphology two
articles, "A Comparative Study of
Palaeontology and Phvlogeny,"and
"The Larva? Stages of Schloen
bachia." In Dr. Jordan's book on
"Evolution" he will have a chapter
on "The Evolution of Fossil Ceph
alopods."
Professor Lindgren is chiefly
busy at present with work for the
United States Geological Survey.
He has in preparation a mono
graph on "The Silver-gold Veins
at Silver City, Idaho," and a bul
letin in connection with a recon
noiscance map of a large part of
Western Idaho. Folios on Boise,
Nampa, and Silver City, Idaho, are
in course of preparation. The
folio for Colfax, California, is also
nearly complete. It contains
many of the more important drift
and hydraulic mines in the Cali
fornia gold belt.
