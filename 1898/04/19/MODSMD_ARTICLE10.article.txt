Intkkcollegiate events are fast
rushing to a climax. Next Satur
day the Tennis Tournament, the
Field-day, and the Debate take
place and the week following the
closing game of the baseball series.
The results of the game Saturday
show how much depends on student
body support, and in Saturday's
contests we hope to see the same.
Every different intercollegiate sport
has its own clientele among the
students. All are ardent for vic
tory in every event, but some
support more earnestly the par
ticular contest which comes
closest to their individual lik
ings. For this reason the bur
den of inspiring the representatives

jof the student body to victory in
the various contests does not full
entirely on the same class, although
there are some few who are num
bered among the enthusiasts in
every intercollegiate event. If
this theory is true, there is one
class in the University which has
not had an opportunity to give a
material proof of their loyalty, and
that class is the one which regards
debating as the most important in
tercollegiate contest, because the
only intellectual struggle against
our sister university. This class is
not small and should include every
student and every member in it*
ranks should he proud to assist
Stanford representatives in the In
tercollegiate Debate by his pres
ence. Debaters need enthusiasm,
college spirit, as much as other
contestants, and this we must give
them in a large quantity. No
charge will be made for the Debate,
and everyone can afford to go.
Jn the Kield-day the same is true,
and while our confidence may not
be so great as was felt last
year, our chances are by no
means insignificant. â€žWe know
every man will do his best,
and that we have athletes as good
as ever before worked on the cinder
path at Stanford. The men will
make the tight of their lives and
the student* should be there to see
it, if for no other motive than for
the sake of the sport. The enjoy
ment of witnessing physical feats is
at the basis of all sport, and those
possessing such an appreciation
should not remain away on account
of a fear of defeat.
