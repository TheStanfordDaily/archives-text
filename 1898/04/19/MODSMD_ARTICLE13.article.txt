The sermon in the chapel Sun
day was by the liev. J. K McLean.
He drew his lesson from the life of
Paul, contrasting the life of Saul of
Tarsus with that of l'aul after his
conversion. This great difference,
as great a one as can he found in
any two characters in history, was
brought about because Paul "was
not disobedient to the Inavenly
vision." The preacher showed what
would have been some of the results
upon his own personality and upon
his influence on his own times and
on all history, if Paul had refused
to obey.
In concluding he said: 'We all
have heavenly visions, inspirations
from above for right things against
wrong tilings. These calls are
backed by a Power which makes
them effective if the soul that re
ceives them answers "yes." There
is no place where such visions oc
cur as a place like this. There is
no such field open, thank God, as
Paul had, but there ire grent inter
spaces yet. Your obedience or dis
obedience to the calls which you
are receiving now will make a
great difference to yourself. It
will tell upon the characters of all
you meet and associate with and
count throughout all history.
Bishop McLean in his prayer
mentioned the critical position of
the country, and during his sermon
spoke with admiration of President
McKi n ley's sober attitude. He
said, speaking of Paul's vision:
l< At critical times God calls forth
the man needed. When a Wash
ington alone will s< rv a Washing
ton; a Lincoln, when only a Lin
coln can do the work; and, I verily
believe, a McKinlev, when a Mc-
Kinley is required, for though lie
is different from these, yet 1 believe
h« will prove equal to the great
need —that man who, if In- were
a crowned head back in history,
would be called "William the
Calm."
