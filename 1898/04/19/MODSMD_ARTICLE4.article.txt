# THE
						BICYCLE RACE.
## First Event of the Field-day Takes Place Tomorrow Afternoon in San Jose. 
### 
The first installment of the Field
day will come off tomorrow at San
Jose, the intercollegiate bicycle
race.
The races will be held at 2:30 at
Cyclers' Park. A large crowd of
students will ride to San Jose to
root for our racers. The party will
leave Encina at one o'clock. As
many as can should go.
Our best men are Sayer and
Hahn, with Marvin and Rodolph
olose up. Murphy will also ride,
but his chances of winning a point
are small because he has not
trained for the event.
Berkeley expects Squires and
Childs to finish one, two, giving
our men a chance to light it out for
the third honors.
The race is two miles, which will
be run in two one-mile heats and
the final. The heats are as fol
lows: First heat —H. Squires, U.C.;
R. T. Fish, U.C.; E. Y. Sayer, S.;
Marvin, S.; Cross, S. Second heat
—W. Childs, U.C.; Cheminant,
U 4 C.; C. Murphy, S.; F. Rodolph,
S.; Hahn, S. First and second
man in each heat will compete in
the final.
Admission is free.
