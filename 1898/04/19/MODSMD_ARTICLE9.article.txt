An intercollegiate event, the bi
cycle race, takes place in San Jose
tomorrow, and as many as can
should surely attend. We have
seen what earnest and systematic
support can do in helping toward
victory, and here is an opportunity
to again prove the value of good
"rooting." The good results fol
lowing a victory for our men in this
event can not be overestimated,*for
it would imbue our other athletes
with a desire to emulate the record
of the bicycle men; it would give us
a very acceptable nest-egg around
which we can add the victories of
Saturday; it is a part of the Field
day, and means as much as any
other event Even for those who
can not be induced to go from a
mere sense of duty to alma mater,
there can be urged the argument
that the bicycle men have trained
faithfully and well—in the face of
difficulties, to be sure —but they are
able to put up a good race. There
will be three events, two heats and
the final, making the contests ex
citing and in every way worth at
tending.
