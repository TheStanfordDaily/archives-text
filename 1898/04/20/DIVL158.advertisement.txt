THE EQUITABLE LIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY
OF THE UNITED STATES
120 Broadway, New Vork Organized 1859
January I, 1898

Outstanding Assurauce
New Assurance Written in 1897

Paid to Policy Holders
Undivided Surplus on four per cent. Standard
$951,165,837
156,955,693
48.572,269
21,106,314
50,543,175
The Business oi the Society is Conducted on the Mutual All Cash Plan
Every Tontine Policy issued by the Equitable Society
twenty years ago, whose Tontine period expires in 181)8, has
a present cash surrender value Greater than the Sum
of the Premiums Paid.
All 20-year Tontine Endowment Policies show a return
HENRY I*. HV'DEi President
of the premiums paid, with interest at rates between 6
and 7 per cent, per Annum.
The Equitable Society has a SURPLUS of $50,543,175, and is the strongest life
assurance company in the world. This is a point of the first importance, since
life assurance contracts may not mature for many years after they have been
entered into by the contracting parties
The advantage enjoyed by the Equitable Society in consequence of its large
surplus and superior financial strength deserves, at this time, special attention
for another reason: the Society now offers to the assuring public a new form of
policy, whose most striking characteristic is that a great numbor of exceed
ingly valuable and definite GUARANTEES are embodied in the contract. Any
guarantee made by a company with a surplus exceeding FIFTY MILLION
DOLLARS is obviously worth more than would be the promise of a company of
limited resources, or of one whose management had been such as to impair'its
financial strength.
