# VARSITY TRACK TEAM.
## Prospects in Saturday's Field-Day and Condition of the Men Who Will Compete. 
### 
The track team has finished its
hard work for the year and is now
in the best shape it was possible to
get in for this year's meet with
Berkeley. It is not the team we
hoped for at the beginning of the
year and thought we would have at
this time. Indeed, to many who
have followed track athletics with
interest this year, it seems more
like a wreck of a team t at never
was, and it seems almost like arro
gance to oppose it in equal combat
to the one which is undoubtedly
the strongest that has ever repre
sented the University of California.
We may add that this latter
opinion is the one that prevails
among the students of that univer
sity, if the editorials of the Califor
nian and Occident voice the stu
dent body sentiment. However, it
is no time now for us to mourn or
to indulge in objurgations against
fate, which has certainly been un
kind to us this year.
The team that will represent us
Saturday afternoon is the strongest
that conscientious and unremitting
labor has been able to form out of
the material at hand. This is not
exactly true, for we have material
fora far stronger team than we
have built up. For fate has been
scattering misfortunes upon us
throughout the season and now at
the end is dumping all that she
has left upon us..
However, all this is past. We
must meet Berkeley with the team
we have. And while it is not our
strongest team, we are not discour
aged. We will win some events
and victory is by no means an im
possibility.
Last Monday there was a try-out
for places in the hundred-yard
dash. With Brunton, Birtch, Kar
ated, and Nourse we have a stronger
team than we expected. At pres
ent Brunton is still stiff, but he is
strong, and when McLeod has soft
ened up his muscles and he has
regained the form which he seems
to have lost during his absence,
the sprinting department of our
team will be satisfactory. Diggles
will be kept fresh for the quarter
mile and, with Brunton and one or
two others who are entered to back
him, will make a good showing. In
the distances Walker, Smith, Will
iams, Strout, Morris, Coolidge, and
Arnold will divide the two runs
between them as seems best. All
are in fairly good condition except
Williams, who had to leave the
University this morning on ac
count of an attack of malaria. He
hopes to enter the Field-day. If
he should be kept out we would
lose one of our strongest distance
runners.
It can not yet be certainly pre
dicted whether Dole will compete
or not. If he does not, only Mor
gan and Culver can be entered in
the hurdles. Craig, '01, who was
a promising man, has just got out
after two weeks' illness. Morgan
will probably be in good shape,
though at present he is troubled
with a weak back. Culver has a
very sore heel, which interferes with
his broad jumping, leaving llop

per, '99, our only representative in
that event. Upon Boyd, '00, will
fall the responsibility for the pole
vault and high jump if Dole does
not enter. Morgan will then have
to go into the high jump and Cul
ver into the pole vault. A week
ago, just as Paul Adams was about
to begin training for the mile walk,
he again injured his weak ankle.
He will be entered, but it is very
likely that our points in that event
will have to be won by Lousley
and Wright, two freshmen. There
have been by far too few men prac
ticing with the weights. Fickert
has been trying to get the double
turn for the hammer throw,so far not
very successfully. Burnett, '00, is
the other most prominent man.
Young has been taking some time
from baseball to devote a little at
tention to the shot.
The first event of the Field-day
is over. The result can be seen by
referring to another column. That
is only the first; Berkeley will be
surprised at our showing in some.
Efforts are being made to obtain
special rates from the S. I'. Co.
There is no sport where yelling
is so effective as running. The
yelling will be organized at the
rally Friday evening. Good sup
port will win points on Saturday.
