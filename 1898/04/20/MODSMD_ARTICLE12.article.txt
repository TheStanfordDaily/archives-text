The Zoology Clul> met Monday
evening at the home of l)r. Gilbert.
J. F. Abbott, '99, gave a talk on
the Nemertina, a group of unseg
uiented worm-like invertebrates,
allied only distantly to the Vermes.
A detailed comparison of the anat
omy, particularly of the nervous
system, of the class with that of
the lowest vertebrates showed a re
markable analogy. This has led
some biological investigators to be
lieve that the Nemertina show a
closer relationship to the primitive
vertebrate ancestor than any other
class of invertebrates. In the em
bryology of the class, which has
scarcely been studied, lies the solu
tion of this interesting problem.
