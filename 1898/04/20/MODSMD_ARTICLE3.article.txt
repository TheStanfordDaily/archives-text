# Of Interest to Seniors.
## 
### 
Some question has been aroused
in regard to the assessment of $5
levied by the Senior Class last
week. This assessment is intended
to cover the entire expenses of the
class, including the debt now due
on the Annual and the necessary
disbursements for Commencement
Week, as estimated by the class
officers. In order that the burden
may fall equally upon the mem
bers of the class a collection com
mittee of fifteen has been ap
pointed, to each of whom has been
assigned the names of ten seniors
for the collection of whose assess
ments they are responsible.
Seniors approached by a member
of this committee, a list of which
may be found below, may know
that they are included in his or
her list and will save themselves
the annoyance of being requested
to pay up by every member of the
committee by arranging for pay
ment to this person. It is hoped
that enough may be collected by
the first of May to extinguish the
debt on the Annual.
The collection committee is as
follows: Misses Ferguson, P. O.
Hamilton, Burckhalter, Hammond,
Fry, Hyde, and Messrs. J. F. West.
L. S. Beedy, W. W. Kemp, P. E.
Davidson, H. S. Sladen, C. M.
Fickert, R. N. Strohn, E. E. Grow,
L. B. Spencer.
