# Tuesday Evening Lecture.
## 
### 
The lecture on Tuesday evening
was given by Professor George A.
Clark, who has been so intimately
connected with the fur seal investi
gations that his words on that sub
ject are well worth listening to.
Without introductory words by the
lecturer, the lantern slides were
shown. These included photo
graphs taken by Dr. Jordan, Pro
fessor Clark, and others, and ink
drawings by Bristow Adams, '00.
After groups of prominent men
who have had the seal question in
charge, came pictures of the Alba
tross, the United States Fish Com
mission steamer which patrols the
islands, and of various points en
route. In proper order came
views of the village on the island
of St. Paul, the government house
there, where the supervising agent
lives, the Greek Church, of whose
cupolas the natives are very proud,
and the native chief himself. Con
cerning the latter the lecturer told
the following: "Jim Freitas, for
that was the chief's name, had
been out one day on duty in the
rain. On coming back he went to
the superintendent and wanted
some medicine. The latter fixed
him up a pretty strong dose and
told him to go to bed. He took
the dose, but, continuing to feel
sick, went to another white man
and was given a second and differ
ent dose. Not yet satisfied, he
consulted the native doctor after
whose treatment he became so
noisy (What wonder?) that the
native council sat on Jim and de
posed him."
After other anecdotes about hu
man life on the islands, the lec
turer turned to the animal life,
showing pictures of the now rare
otter and walrus, of the blue fox,
hair seal, and finally of the fur seal
in all possible attitudes and group
ings.
