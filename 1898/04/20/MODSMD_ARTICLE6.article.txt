# Let Every One Wave Together!
## 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto. â€”My
communication of Monday seems
to have been somewhat misunder
stood. You suggest a differentia
tion of Stanford men and Stanford
women in their manner of express

mg enthusiasm which, if adopted,
would he most unfortunate. It is
true women do not swell the volume
of Bound materially in the yells, hut
it is a real satisfaction to them to
add their mite on occasions. On
the other hand, men are so lavishly
endowed that they can both yell
and wave, and do it simultaneously
too. In fact Nature very frequently
impels them to do so. Now wav
ing wouldn't amount to a "hill of
beans" if left to the women, unless
ihe men retired from the Stanford
section and allowed the women to
bank themselves together there.
Waving to he effective must be reg
ularly organized. The hats, um
brellas, penants, and handkerchiefs
waving together would express mere
enthusiasm. A solid bank of car
dinal handkerchiefs of uniform size
and color caught at the middle so
that all four corners would wave,
and shaken vigorously just above
the head slightly to the right so as
not to obscure the view, would ex
press Stanford enthusiasm, Stan
ford fellowship, Stanford solidity.
All must wave together at a given
signal simultaneously with the
yells or instead of yelling when
that would be out of place. Just
fancy greeting the appearance of
our track men or debaters on Sat
urday b}' such a massed display of
cardinal! The effect would be tre
mendous. If the ghost of that
Stanford hoodoo were prowling
about it would be vanquished for
ever by the sight.
We must have regular wave
leaders and wave together, Mr.
Editor, or else not attempt it at all.
Let us have a rally Friday night
and practice both yelling and wav
ing. We must have that cup.
A Student.
