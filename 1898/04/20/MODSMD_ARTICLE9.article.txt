The annual rally the evening
before the Field-day and Debate
will lie held this year as usual and
we hope with as much spirit and
enthusiasm. Rallies have become
a distinctive feature of Stanford
student life and the custom is in
no danger of dying out from lack
of vigor. This year we have to
prepare for three intercollegiate
contests: The Tennis Tournament
on Saturday morning, the Kield
day in the afternoon, and the De
bate in the evening The rally
will he held in the chapel where
every one can attend.
This year is the crisis of our de
bating interests. The university
winning Saturday's contest will re
ceive as a trophy the Examiner
cup, now in our possession, to
mark the winning of three out of
five debates since 18W2, the year in
which the cup was offered. The
loss of the Carnot Debate makes
the winning of the Intercollegiate
Debate absolutely essential if we
are to maintain our high place in
debating. We believe our de
baters appreciate the' responsibility
placed upon them and we have
confidence tiiat their careful prep
aration combined with their na
tive ability, with good team work,
will keep the cup at Stanford.
In tennis and on the track the
teams will receive the best possible
support, and whatever the results,
we know that they will do their
best to triumph, and that con
scientious efforts against heavy odds
will characterize the two meets.
Let every one be present at the
rally to prepare the student body's
part in the contests.
