# CROSS THE COACH.
## Choice of the Management, Announced Today, Meets With Universal Approval. 
### 
"Harry Cross will be our next
coach." Football Manager 1 ricluird
and Captain Fisher made the an
nouncement today that the popular
Yale man would again have charge
of our Varsity football interests.
Representative men who have been
consulted are unanimously in favor
of the management's choice.
Harry I*. Cross is a Yale '96
graduate and is a noted athlete.
During his football career Mr.
Cross played as guard on Yale's
second eleven against Hickok and
McCrea, and later as center against
the famous Stillman. When Still
man graduated Cross immediately
took his position as center on the
varsity team of '95, which de
feated Princeton 20-10. Cross was
also a member of Yale's track
team during his college course,
having a record of 185 feet in the
hammer throw. He represented
Yale against the Cambridge team
in England, and the New York
Athletic Club in the All-America
vs. All-England field games.
Since coaching the Stanford team
two years ago Mr. Cross has mar
ried, and his wife will accompany
him to California next September.
Doctor Angell is very much
pleased with the selection of Mr.
Cross as football coach for the com
ing season He said: "'Mr. Cross,
when here before, made a very good
impression both among the mem
bers of the faculty and with the
students. He is a thorough gentle
man and a master of the game in
every department. His enthusiasm
and loyalty are the characteristics
which go to inspire confidence in
the men who work with him. 1
do not think a better man could
have been chosen. Mr. Cross was
originally recommended to us by
our old friend Mr. Walter Camp
and has proved himself in every
respect what he was recommended
to be. Yes, the choice of Mr. Cross
is highly satisfactory and be ought
to receive a hearty reception."
Football Manager Prichard is
enthusiastic over our next coach.
He said: The management can
vassed the Eastern field very thor
oughly before selecting Mr. Cross
as our next coach, and found none
more highly recommended than
Mr. Cross, whom we knew already
from our own experience to be an
active and efficient coach and one
who would have a good influence
on the team. Mr. Cross is an en
thusiastic college man, and is still
connected with college, at present
attending the Harvard Law School.
He has had a good opportunity to
follow the game, having attended
all the big Eastern matches of this
year and last. He has had several
offers as a coach in leading uni
versities of the East, which he
refused, and we should feel compli
mented at his acceptance. Mr.
Cross is a coach merely on account
of his interest in athletics, and re
ceives only his expenses and not a
salary for his services.
''We hope this year to build up
a system of graduate coaches under
Mr Cross, as the next season will un
doubtedly be the last in which Stan

ford will have an Eastern coach.
We shall endeavor to have leading
graduates work under Mr. Cross in
order to prepare for the successful
introduction of the new system of
graduate coaches."
Captain Forrest S. Fisher has
the utmost confidence in Cross:
"Harry Cross was recommended hy
Walter Camp, and there is no man
in whose ability and judgment
Stanford has more confidence.
While here before he was respected
alike hy students and faculty. He
is loyal to Stanford, having refused
more flattering offers in the East,
lie is well acquainted with our
men and the class of training and
coaching needed. His ability to
enthuse our team with the proper

spirit is one of the main factors.
A line needs to be developed, and
he has demonstrated that with
proper material he can do it.
The local coach proposition was
abandoned because we have to
make practically a new team next
year."
Ex-Captain Steuart W. Cotton,
'1)8, when seen on the quad this
morning, expressed his opinion as
follows: "The appointment of
Cross meets my approval. Cross
is a hard worker, a man of en
thusiasm, and has a good influence
on a team. He built up for us
two years ago a 20-0 team out of
practically nothing and coached us
to our first great victory. He has
had the great advantage of having
been a pupil of Cam]), in addition
to his own ability as a player and

liis knoweldge of Yale methods.
We have learned the lessons of the
guards-back play, we have Fisher
tichind the line, and next year we
need again a man who can build
up a line, and this Cross can do.
The combination should win us
another victory."
Nat Carle approved of the man
agement's selection: "I am in favor of
Cross and am glad he was appointed.
He is entirely in spirit with the foot
ball men, and his reappointment
is a proof of the respect and confi
dence in which he is held. Cross
is a man of enthusiasm, and that
counts a whole lot in football. I
shall always remember the spirit
Cross inspired in our 20-0 team
the night before the game."
