# Symphony Club Concert.
## 
### 
The Symphony Club will give a
concert on Monday evening, May
2, in the chapel. The club has
been practicing steadily through
the whole semester, and it is be
lieved that they can present a very
acceptable program.
The program has not as yet been
fixed, but will include three or four
numbers by the cluh and probably
three solo numbers. The symphony
presented will be Haydn's sixth.
The overture, "Lustspiel," by
Keler Bela, will also be given. The
other numbers and further details
will be announced later.
