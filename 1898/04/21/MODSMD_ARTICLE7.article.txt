If the rest of the track team can
do as well as the bicycle men there
will be great rejoicing among Stan
ford people after the Field-day on
Saturday. Lf the men in each event
can do as much more than was ex
pected of them the score will be as
one-sided as that of the last base
ball game. In«t«ad of being seven
points ahead of us as they ex
pected, our rivals are only one
point ahead. We have three points
more than we had after the bicycie
race last year and Berkeley has
two less.
The bicycle men showed excel
lent team work yesterday, and it is
team work that counts in Stanford
victories, according to the editor of
the Occident. After the trial heats
there was not much chance for
team work on the part of Berkeley
—except the work of Squires, and
we will admit that he is a whole
team in himself. The men who
finished ahead earned their Varsity
sweaters, but they did not do it all
themselves. While they are being
congratulated the men who helped
win the points by sacrificing their
own chances must not be forgotten,
even though there is no white S on
the breast of each one as a recog
nition of his merits.
