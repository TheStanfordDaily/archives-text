The announcement of the toot
ball management that Harry P.
Cross of Yale is to be our next
Varsity football coach is one that
will receive universal approbation.
Mr. Cross is known to every Stan
ford student of football history as
our " 20-0 " coach, and to him the
credit is due of starting the ball
rolling t»> last year s pinnacle of
28-0. With only ordinary mater
ial Mr. Cross succeeded in building
np a line that held against the on
slaughts of llansome and Sherman,
and a team which was imbued with
that "never die" spirit which not
only wins victories but rolls up
scores so large that cries of 'flukes"
never meet the ear after a contest.
Next year is the most critical year
of our football history. We lose
by graduation live men, and many
promising second men will not re
turn. It will take a man like Cross
to rebuild our weakened line. Next
year also will mark the end of the
policy of employing Eastern
coaches and the management will
attempt to institute a system of
graduate coaches in order to pre
pare the way for the following year.
Mr. Cross has all the qualities of a
coach, enthusiasm, and capacity to
control a team, and we have no
doubt that his selection will mark
the beginning of a successful season.
