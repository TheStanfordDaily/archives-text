# ON TRACK AND FIELD.
## Cardinal and Blue and Gold Athletes Will Struggle for Supremacy Tomorrow. 
### 
The annual contest on the track
between California and Stanford
will he fought tomorrow afternoon
at '2:80 o'clock on the Olympic
grounds. The entries are given
below.
Both teams are not in their best
form. Stanford has lost Dole, and
U. C. Bakewell; but the loss is by
no means equal, the margin still
being in California's favor. The
results of the bicycle race have en
couraged the team, and they will
go into the contest prepared to
turn if possible the balance in our
favor. Captain Brunton has stead
ily improved the last week.
