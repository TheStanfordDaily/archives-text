# Military Enthusiasm.
## 
### 
Stanford has given evidence of
her loyalty. The news that Min
ister Woodruff had been granted
his passports by Spain and that
American warships had been sent
to blockade the harbor of Havana,
reached the campus at six o'clock
last evening, and when the stu
dents in Encina assembled in the
lobby after dinner there were im
mediately patriotic demonstrations
The national airs were sung and
then all students present fell into
line for drill and marching, which
continued about twenty minutes.
At the end of the impromptu
drill a meeting of those present
was held, and it was decided to
form a company and effect a regu
lar organization, with the object in

view, for the present, of gaining a
knowledge of military tactics; for
the future, whatever might be
thought advisable. Chandler, '00,
who has had considerable military
experience, was elected to the com
mand of the company.
A muster roll was started, and
about sixty names were immedi
ate! v secured.
A call has been issued to those
men in the University who have
had military experience to meet in
Encina after the rally this evening
to discuss the plan of effecting a
considerable military organization.
A large number of students have
had military experience, and it
seems that whatever companies
may be organized at Stanford will
not suffer from a lack of efficient
officers.
