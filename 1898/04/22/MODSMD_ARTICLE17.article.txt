Baseball has been at a stand
still this week from the failure of
both the Varsity and the second
team men in appearing regularly
for practice. We can excuse this
in a measure by the press of Uni
versity work which confronts every
one at this season of the year
and also by the unusually severe
practice of the preceding week. Hut
the time for rest is over: already
Berkeley is preparing fora desper
ate struggle for victory. The score
is a tie, and unless we keep our
base-running and fielding up to the
level of our batting game, luck in
the form of inexcusable errors may
lose us the championship. From
now on the men must pi.'y ball.
