The military company which is
to be formed in Encina should not
be a mere burst of martial enthusi
asm created by the news of our
national war with Spain. There is
room at Stanford fora permanent
company which can give the stu
dents instruction in military sci
ence, which every American citizen
should have. The intention of the
students should be serious. Let
them organize a company, drill
faithfully under those who have
already had military training, and
then if our country needs their ser
vices enlist in the national service,
as did the college men of '61. Stan
ford students are patriotic, and will
require no urging to respond to
their country's call, whenever
made.
