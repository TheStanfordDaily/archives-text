# FOR THE SILVER CUP.
## Intercollegiate Debate Will Decide the Possession of the "Examiner" Trophy. 
### 
Following is the score of the In
tercollegiate Debates, which now
stands three to two in our favor,
although there is a tie for the Ex
aminer cup offered in 1894:
1893 —Stanford.
1894 —Stanford.
1895 —California.
1896 —California.
IS97 —Stanford.
If Stanford wins, our supremacy
in the intercollegiate contest will
be established and the cup will be
ours; if California wins she takes
the cup, but only ties the score.
The question for debate was
chosen February 24 by the Stan
ford team as follows: "Resolved,
That the system of unrestricted
production of prison-made goods,
for sale in the open market, on the
the public account, is preferable as
a system of prison management to
that which is in operation in the
State of New York." One week
later the U. C. team chose the af
firmative of the question, which
Messrs. Overstreet, Clark, and
Dannenbaum will uphold against
the Stanford team, Messrs. Mor
gan, Bailie, and Ferguson. The
order of speakers will probably be
as above. Mr. Morgan will open
the question for Stanford, Mr.
Bailie will elaborate and rebut,
and Mr. Ferguson will close. All
are leady speakers.
The judges are Judge Garroute,
Attorney Pierson, and Commis
sioner Chipman, all impartial and
satisfactory to both universities.
President Jordan will preside. The
debate will begin promptly at 8
p.m., and every one is urged to be
present before that time.
