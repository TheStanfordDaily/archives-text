# Sheehan Disappointed.

### 
"Jack" Sheehan came down un
expectedly this afternoon to watch
the nine at work. Me seemed dis
appointed at the lack of interest
shown by the men. He said, "I
am surprised at the attitude shown
by the Varsity and second nines.
They should practice at least two
hours every afternoon.
"It is a mistake to think the
men have worked too much this
season. They have not done
enough to hurt them. Berkeley
is fairly slaving to heat us. Every
man must come out every day, if
we wtuld win."
