# TENNIS, TRACK, AND DEBATE.
## Three Intercollegiate Events Lost in One Day to the Teams From Across the Bay.

very interesting series of matches,
in which Picher put up a fine
game and Schneider gave Stone
a close race. Hardy defeated Picher,
6-4, 7-5, and Stone defeated
Schneider, 6-1, 6-7, 8-6. Hardy
and Selby won the doubles,
7-5, 6-3.
