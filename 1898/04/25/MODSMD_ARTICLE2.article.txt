# Field-Day.
## 
### 
The Stanford track team fought
an up-hill tight in the Field-day
against insurmountable odds
without once losing heart. Every
man did his hest, and in several
events that proved too much for
the U. C. athletes. The final score
was 88 to 38.
Morgan and Smith were the two
stars 011 the cardinal horizon Sat
urday afternoon. Morgan tied
Hoffman in the fatiguing high
jump at 5 feet inches, and then
without any rest won the 120-yard
hurdle in 16 1-5 and later the
220-yard hurdle in 26 2-5, not be
ing crowded in either event. The
intercollegiate record in the high
jump was raised half an inch.
Smith ran a heady race in the
mile, as well as a race speedy
enough to reduce the intercollegi
ate record to 4:38 2-5. Smith took
the lead at the crack of the pistol
and set up a 4:40 pace for the
whole race. Men were sent to
outstrip Smith, hut they never
passed him or threw him out of his
stride. At the turn of the last lap
Carroll tried to spurt by and the
men ran nip and luck for ten
yards, but Smith's superior
strength carried him to the front
and he finished five yards ahead in
the prettiest race of the day. Will
iams also finished strong and dan
gerously near to Carroll.
In the half it was Carpenter and
Carroll against Smith and Walker.
Walker ran a splendid race until
the final spurt, and Smith was
about twenty yards out of position
fora place. At the turn Carpenter
and Carroll spurted by Walker,
who was in a fainting condition.
Smith then commenced a magnifi
cent spurt of fifty yards, passing
Carroll and finishing near Carpen
ter, who won in 2:03 4-5.
Brunton in the sprints was far
from his old-time form when he
ran second to Joe Bernhard, who
ran in 10 1-5, and he was beaten
by both Drum and Woolsey. Brun
ton ran a fast fifty yards but
lacked the spurting power fora
good finish.
Culver in the 120-yd. hurdle gave
Dawson a close race for second,
and won three points for Stanford
in the broad jump with 21 feet 5
inches, Broughton breaking the
record with 22 feet 10 inches.
Boyd in the pole va"Ult cleared
10 feet 3 inches handily. Fickert
was outclassed in the weights.
Lousley took third in the mile walk
by a wonderful spurt at the finish.
Diggles won third in the 440.
The events were run off slowly,
more on account of the entries of
men in more than one event than
of the officials, of whom Mr. Cary
wub referee.
