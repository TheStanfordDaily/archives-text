The sixth annual Intercollegiate
Debate was lost to California Sat
urday evening. The loss of the
debate gave California the Exam
iner cup, offered in 1894 to the col
lege first winning three debates,
and tied the score, which is now
three all.
The attendance at the debate
was good, and the rooters from
each university bandied back and
forth their yells without a single
breathing interval until Dr. .Jor
dan took the chair and announced
the conditions and rules of the de
bate. The judges were Supreme
Justice C. 11. Garoutte, Mr. W. M.
Pierson, and General N. P. Chip
man The question was, "Resolved,
That the system of unrestricted
production of prison-made goods,
tor sale in the open market, on the
public account, is preferable as a
system of prison management to
that which is in operation in the
State of New York." It was ex
plained that "on the public ac
count" was a technical term, and
that "as a system of prison man
agement" was not a term of limita

t ion. The California speakers,
11. A. Overstreet, George Clark,
and A. J. Dannebaum, had the
a tlirmative, and A. B. Morgan, S.G.
Hailie, and James Ferguson of
(Stanford were for the negative.
The general characteristic of the
U. C. team was its co-ordination.
The question had been carefully
divided among the three speakers,
and each brought forward a par
ticular phase of the question, but
did not neglect to reinforce and re
fresh the points of the preceding
member of their team. The result
was a clear, harmonious, and con
nected view of the subject from
their standpoint. The Berkeley
men were strong in rebuttal, es
pecially Clark, and showed that
they had mastered some telling tie
bating tactics. They showed the
effect of thorough study under
good coaching.
The Stanford team was not in
dividually equal to their oppo
nents, either in form or argument,
and the latter fact was a surprise
as Stanford had a good side of the
question. The arguments were
good, but they were not cleverly
handled, especially in rebuttal,
which was particularly weak. The
Berkeley men left themselves open
at points which were not assailed,
and their strongest arguments, for
which an answer was challenged,
were left untouched. Their pre
sentation, however, had the merit
of straightforwardness, unadorned
by any superfluous expressions. It
often lacked vividness and con
concreteness, however.
H. A. Overstreet opened the de
bate for Berkeley and outlined very
clearly the issues of the evening.
He said in brief: The ends of im
prisonment are to punish the crim
inal and to reform him. Nine
tenths of the criminals become so
because they will not work. Idle
ness in prison continues this ten
dency, while penal, non-producing
labor has been found to have a
brutalizing tendency. Prison labor
should deter convicts from crime in
the future, and should reform them
by inducing habits of work. We
advocate the open-market system
in which the proceeds of convict
labor accrue to the state, and in
which there is no limitation to
prison production. The New York
system is restrictive and results in
idleness. Fluctuating demand
causes irregular en plovment. Con
victs can not be productively em
ployed and have to be kept busy
pushing heavy carts, working hand
looms, breaking stone, and like
brutalizing and degrading labor.
The New York system does not se
cure constant and productive em
ployment and fails as a reform sys
tem. Besides it is needlessly ex
pensive. If the market is unham
pered prisons can be made reason
ably paying.
A. B. Morgan of Stanford fol
lowed and outlined the argument
of the negative. He brought out
the fact that the public account
system did not provide labor for
the state, county, and city reform
atories as in the New York system.
The aims of a prison system are to
be self-supporting and to protect
society. Demand could not be lack
ing nor could there be idleness in

the New York system, which not
only supplied the needs of state in
stitutions but also the needs of
every political subdivision of the
state. The public account system
does not diversify competition; it
sacrifices the future economic wel
fare of the prisoner, gives him no
breadth of training nor technical
skill, and fits him for no practical
use. It is extravagant to the state
both in buying and selling, and
does not provide for all prisons.
The New York system diversifies
industry, saves commissions in buy
ing and selling, and does away
with prison rings.
Ciark of U. C. devoted his time
to proving that the New York sys
tem was not designed as a reform
measure but to catch the labor vote,
that it did not secure constancy of
employment as in the public ac
count system, that it failed to pro
vide for all the labor of the state
prisons, not even including state
penitentiaries, that it failed in re
form elements. He went into the
question of competition under the
two systems and attempted to show
that competition was just as severe
in the New York system because it
shifted the burden on unskilled
labor.
S. G. Bailie of Stanford held
that the New York system did
not lessen but distributed competi
tion. His argument was on the
lines of the relative protection to
society in the two systems. He
compared the treatment of crim
inals in the two systems, and
showed how greater reform elements
were centered in the New York sys
tem, which has met with the ap
proval of penologists.
Dannebaum showed the sim
ilarity of competition in the two
systems by an economic argument,
and then threw out a challenge
that the New York system could
not be applied to the Western and
Southern States. His argument
was the most original of the even
ing.
Ferguson of Stanford showed how
competition was distributed under
the New York system, and that
competition must be measured by
the ratio of convict labor to free
labor in a certain industry. He
showed that the public account sys
tem was never self-supporting, and
asked the U. C. men why they did
not advocate the contract system,
which was the nearest to self-sup
porting yet devised. He showed
that the public account system did
not provide labor for the county
and city jails, and advocated the
New York plan as most equitable
and most just.
Clark ably summed up the de
bate for U. C.
A short conference, and the
judges gave the decision to Berke
lev.
