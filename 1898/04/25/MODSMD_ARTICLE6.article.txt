To explain and to offer condo
lences to the student body for three
defeats in one day is almost too
much of a burden, but it is very
simple: Stanford was outclassed
in all three by their U. C. oppo
nents. In l he Field-day we did not
expect to win and we could not, on
account of the crippled condition of
our team. The re.-ult was no sur
prise, and the grit and pluck of the
Stanford team in lighting bravely
against such odds was apparent and
deserved the applause received.
Such spirit is the kind to cultivate,
that of spwH for sport's sake, and
as long as we have that spirit we
need fear no defeat.
The Tennis Tournament was lost
before the day of the matches. We
can not choose a team two days be
fore the contest and hope to win.
This fact was pointed out in suffi
cient time in these columns, and
the burden must rest wherever it
falls.
The Intercollegiate Debate was
lost to a team which showed super
ior training in the art of debate.
Leaving out the question of native
ability and oratorical power and
finish, the fact remains that the
men from California handled their
arguments with more skill, more
definiteness, more concreteness.
They took advantage of every turn
in argument, glazed over difacul
ties, and minimized defects in t heir
own system, and cleverly shifted
the burden of proof from their own
shoulders to those of their op
ponents. The Stanford speakers,
we know, did their best, but the
question arises, why there should
be such an astonishing reversal in
form in the team of I.SDS, when the
team of the former year possessed
such admirable form and know
ledge of debi ting. If there are
evils in our system we must root
them out. No hlame can lie upon
the team, which fought the best

light possible, but they are the
product of our debating system; and
a candid inquiry into the causes of
defeat can lie made without reflect
ing any discredit upon a team as
loyal as ever represented Stanford.
