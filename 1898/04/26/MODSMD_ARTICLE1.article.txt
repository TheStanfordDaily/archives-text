# A 						THE BONE OF CONTENTION.
## Junior Farce by Wallace Irwin to be Staged Thursday Evening in Encina Gym. 
### 
The Junior Farce, ''The Bone of
Contention," this year was written
by Wallace Irwin, '00, in a Uni
versity competition,and thecasthas
been chosen from tne student body
at large instead of restricting the
choice to the limits of one class.
The cast is practicing every even
ing under Stage Manager Irwin for
the performance next Thursday
evening in Encina gymnasium.
The farce is fully up to the stand
ard of previous University farces
and it has the merit of deal
ing with a subject not elabor
ated upon to any extent by pre
vious authors —that of college
rushes. Its satire fails also upon
the American custom of instituting
societies whenever anything is to
be accomplished, and in the farce
the Rev. Bildad Burble of Boston
arrives at Stanford University in
those days when rushing and clash
ing between the lower classes was a
common sight, and in true Ameri
can fashion organizes a society for
the prevention of college rushes.
With this as a central motive, hum
orous incidents are brought in, and
other university customs held up
for public inspection. The cast is
large, and the play is varied from
first to last. ''School inarm" spec
ials, class rushers, and "frat" men
appear during the action.
Following is the cast of charac
ters:
