How many students have read
the installments of the seria 1 story
of the editor of the Sequoia, entitled
"The Holy Man in Polities''? If
every student has not, surely every
one ought. The Sequoia this year
has been conducted in the interests
of the student body and has at
tempted to supply the needs of the
student body, in addition to main
taining a high literary standard.
It has succeeded in fulfilling its
function of supplementing the
Daily Palo Alto, which is primar
ily a newspaper, by publishing arti
cles which reflect the tendencies of
our University life. The story re
ferred to is an instance of this.
The story embodies the results of
long and careful observation of
student body politics and the meth
ods cf student body politicians.
The characters are clothed with life
and move about the quadrangle
exactly as do the types which they
represent, the machine politicians.
It is to be hoped that the story will
have the effect of causing those who
are usually misled by the crafty
wiles of the student body politi

jcian whose delight lien in "combi
, nations" and "trades," to beware
of him in any shape and form,
j Student body politics are corrupt,
i because the student?, both men and
women, do not all fulfil their duty
of acquainting themselves of the
merits of student body candidates
and questions. A large body of in
dependent voters would soon cause
any attempt to railroad ''tickets"
and "slates" through the student
body to fail of their own inertia.
| Any observing student can readily
! detect a ny trickery. <>r jobbery which
I is attempted, and when discovered
it should lie struck at with might
| and main. "He sure you're right,
1 then go ahead."'
