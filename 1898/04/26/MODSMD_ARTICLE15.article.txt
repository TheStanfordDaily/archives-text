# College Men as Leaders.

### 
C. C. Michener, College Secretary
of the Y. M. 0. A., spoke in the
chapel Sunday morning on "The
leadership of college men." He
said that it is recognized that col
lege men have the country in their
power. Young men, however, often
think that the world is waiting for
them, and it takes them some time
to adjust themselves to the cold,
hard matter-of-fact way in which
they are received. The world does
not ask "What college gave you
your degree?" Still less does it
ask "What degree did you get?"
The only question is "What are
you good for?"
Mr. Michener went on to say
that the future life and work of
men will never rise much above
the level of their life in their col
lege days. He then showed what
the Y. M. (J. A. is doing for college
men in practical Christian work in
the colleges through the study of
the Hi hie and the summer con
ference and schools of methods
which hundreds of college men at
tend every summer. He said that
it is coming more and more to he
true that the best educated men
are the hest Christians and
that for skeptics you must search
among the ignorant classes.
