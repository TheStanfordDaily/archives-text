# The
						'99 Annual.
## 
### 
The Junior Annual will be
placed on sale next Monday, and
notices to that effect have
been sent out to all sub
scribers. The book is now in the
hands of the binders, having
passed unscatched through the
supervision of the faculty com
mittee. Manager Greenebaum,
when seen today, had the follow
ing to say regarding the finances
and the subscription to the book:
''We hope to have the Annual
ready Monday, but if not then at
least early in the week. J have
issued only 600 copies, and no more
will be issued. Subscribers will be
given the first chance at the book.
There are about four hundred sub
scriptions already taken, and as
we will use about one hundred for
advertisers and other purposes
there are but a few over a hun
dred books unsold. Those who
subscribe for these will get them.
Subscriptions may be given to me
either at my room or on the quad.
The editor and members of the staff
will also take subscriptions until
the number is exhausted. I think
that we are financially safe exclu
sive of the debt incurred by the
class last February to start the
book. This year's Annual will be
bound in red, and puts up a hand
some appearance both inside and
outside. The price is -$1.50."
