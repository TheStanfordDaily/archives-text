# TODAY'S PRACTICE.
## Varsity Men Under Coach Sheehan Prepare for the Championship Game Saturday. 
### 
Jack Sheehan was on the dia
mond this afternoon to begin the
finishing touches on the Varsity
nine. When asked as to the
championship chances, he said: "It
seems to me that the team has not
been playing ball since the last
victory. Berkeley is of course put
ting forth everv effort to win the
final game. We have the team to
carry away the championship, but
without keeping up form and fami
liarity with the ball they can never
win. I am disappointed at the
spirit among the men. They must
get out and drill hard the rest of
this week. 1 expect to stay until
Saturday and do what I can for the
team. I must have men at the
practices at four o'clock."
In the preliminary warm-up this
afternoon the outtield made a very
poor showing. The infield was
about the same as usual. Harris
was not on the second bag, being
laid up with grip. The practice
game resulted in a victory for the
first team by a score of 5 to 1.
The line-up was as follows:
VARSITY. SECOND.
Beckett p Lanagan
