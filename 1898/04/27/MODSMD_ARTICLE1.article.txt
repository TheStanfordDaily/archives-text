# DEBATING AT STANFORD.
## Opinions of Faculty Men Regarding Our Reverses and the Existing System. 
### 
Acting upon several suggestions,
the Daily Palo Alto has collected
interviews from various members
of the faculty upon our debating
reverses this year and also upon
the debating system existing at
Stanford. These are especially in
teresting and suggestive, and the
discussion of the subject should
have a good effect.
PRESIDENT JORDAN.
There are two ideals in debating.
The one is to know the subject
thoroughly and to treat it con
scientiously. The other is to win
debates, if the latter is what we
are after our men must learn to
use good English, not merely cor
rect grammar, but language terse,
strong, and picturesque, and to
handle it rapidly. They must use
the voice in such fashion as to pro
duce a clear, forcible, and pleasant
impression. They must cultivate
the art of seeming to'be in earnest —
or of being in earnest, which is a
better thing. In the late debate
Mr. Clark seemed to be in earnest,
Mr. Overstreet had grace and a
tine choice of words, Mr. Dannen
baum marked time, and our repre
sentatives furnished chiefly ideas
and statistics. They converted the
judges, but they did so as scholars,
not as debaters.
PROFESSOR H. R. FAIRCLOUGH.
Why does Stanford fail in de
bate? Partly, 1 believe, for the fol
lowing reasons.
1. We have entertained wrong
ideas as to a debate, which is es
sentially a literary contest. Rhet
oric belongs to literature, not to
economics, sociology, history, or
law. These departments may fur
nish the necessary facts and figures,
but the presentation of a subject
calls for literary treatment. Bet
ter for the debater to study Macau
lay and Burke, Cicero and Demos
thenes, than commissioners' re
ports and government blue-books.
The only Stanford student who
has won the Carnot medal was a
specialist in a literary course.
2. As a rule, we do not secure
debaters of the proper type. Our re
cent representatives were excellent
men,the best, in fact, who presented
themselves. But it is not to their
discredit, if we claim that they are
not typical college students. Two
of them, for example, are married
men. One, I am informed, is a
practiced politician, the second a
professional teacher, and the third
an ordnined preacher, in a college
debate (not, of course, in other
spheres), this very seasoning is
prejudicial to our interests. The
college debater should have, not
the air of an experienced veteran,
but rather that of a very promising
recruit.
What about the fraternities es
tablished at Stanford? These con
tain many of our brightest students
and yet few of these societies are
represented in the preliminary de
bates. Let every fraternity encour
age its most intellectual member to
enter these contests. Why not try
inter-fraternitv debates?

3. We rely too much on the purely
argumentative character of a speech.
Let us take it for granted that both
sides will be equally well equipped
with arguments. The decision will
depend upon charm of delivery, ele
gance of diction, and style. Lite
rary cultivation is what tells in
the end.
PROFESSOR W. 11. HUDSON.
1 consider our recent debating
failures as due very largely to our
overwhelming faith in the scientific
method, instilled or fostered in
nearly all our class-room work,
and to our consequent lack of
realization of the meaning and
value of literary methods and iit
erary culture, it seems to me that
here we touch what is already a
tradition, and threatens to become
a settled and very disastrous tra
dition m our University. Now, the
scientific method is admirable for
the obtaining of results; for the
effective presentation and exposi
tion of results on the platform we
need the literary method and the
powers which literary culture
alone can give. Let me refer to
the case of the late Professor Hux
ley. A scientist through and
through, he none the less exhibits
in all his non-technical addresses
and essays rare literary quali
ties —mastery of language, wealth
of illustration and allusion, skill
in the organization of the raw
material of science, power of
telling appeal. In other words,
Huxley thoroughly understood
that while the method of
science has its place and func
tion, the methods of literature are
not to be disregarded by any one
who wishes to reach a wide audi
ence in the presentation of facts
and arguments. In the develop
ment of the qualities prerequisite
to effective public speaking we
must look to a large, generous,
sound literary training. We shall
never cultivate them by the study
of blue books and statistics, or by
work in the laboratory—no, not if
we toil till we are gray.
PROFESSOR E. A. ROSS.
We have no prospects unless new
supplies of debating material come
forward. There is a tendency to
regard debating as the affair of the
law, history and economics stu
dents. This short circuit won't do.
Unless men of the four great lit
erary departments compete we
can't win next year. We must
have men of good brains, voice,
presence, and English in the pre
liminaries, even if they are not
trained in the stock subjects of de
bate. I would suggest:
1. Let the instructors in the lit
erary departments urge their bright
men to compete.
2. Get fellows to come in even if
they haven't studied the subjtcts
debated.
8. Let the fraternities compete
in debating, as well as baseball.
PROFESSOR F. J. A. DAVIDSON.
I will merely say that I have
felt tlie cause of failures in debate
to lie largely in the fact that argu
ment, rather than eloquence, has
been the aim of our debaters, and
that tliev have been chosen with
reference to their ability in the for
mer rather than brilliance in the

latter. Every question lias two
sides, and it is comparatively easy
to find arguments on either. Elo
quence therefore is the decisive fac
tor. It is even my belief that
California teams have sometimes
won with inferior arguments he
cause of their greater command of
language and greater stress on the
graces of oratory. The training
which gives these qualities is, 1
hold, naturally one derivable from
the study of language and allied
subjects. I should therefore be
glad to see, for our future debates,
more emphasis laid upon this
point and more representatives
chosen who have had such train
ing.
PROFESSOR E. DANA DURAND.
It is my impression from hear
ing the Carnot, Intercollegiate, and
Inter-Society debates that Stanford
is scarcely equal to many smaller
institutions —for instance, to my
alma mater, Oberlin. Unless rec
ollection deceives me, Oberlin's
men and women were no less logi
cal than our own, and were de
cidedly more at ease and more pol
ished in literary and oratorical
style. This superiority is perhaps
due partly to the fact that most
students there take general-culture
instead of specialized courses; but
still more to the greater amount of
interest and of training in literary
work both in and out of the class
room. All freshmen and soph
omores have "rhetoricals" weekly.
Here, under teachers able to give
example as well as precept, they
write "themes," with a view to se
curing not merely correctness but
also facility and grace of style,
and pra tice oral delivery and ges
ture as well. A large proportion
of the students take further elec
tive work in literature, compo
sition, and elocution. Those
chosen to represent the college at
contests are given special assist
ance Nearly all students, more
over, join early in their course one
of the literary societies. The
standards of these societies are high
and their rivalry keen. At Cor
nell and, I believe, at many of our
other great eastern universities
also, such special training in ex
pression is given a more prominent
place in the curriculum and in
student interest than at Stanford.
PROFESSOR C. A. DUNIVVAY.
California's victory in the debate
waswon by a thoroughly well-trained
team of more than average native
ability. Each of the three men is
at ease upon the platform, has a
good command of language, reasons
logically and continuously, displays
a contagious confidence in the force
of his reasoning—in a word, has a
speaking personality. The team
play, also, was excellent. Each
debater made his points clearly as
essential contributions to the total
effect of the affirmative argument.
The Berkeley men deserved their
success. They would stand in the
front ranks of debating teams
picked from the undergraduates of
any of our American universities.
The Stanford team seemed to be
demoralized by the strength of their
opponents. Not one of them spoke
as effectively as in the preliminary
debates. They were lacking in
spontaneous and convincing ear

neatness. Perhaps tliey were "over
trained." Tliey were weak in the
assault upon the affirmative. They
became mere apologists for the neg
ative position. They neglected to
follow the first principles of per
suasive public speech in that they
failed to coordinate all their argu
ments for the luminous develop
ment of two or three simple
but fundamental considerations.
Against the clean cut, perfectly
definite, constantly reiterated prop
ositions of their opponents, they
suggested but did not drive home
countervailing arguments. Hy con
trast with an exceptional team, a
good average debating team was
made to appear weaker than it
really is.
The result of this one debate is
not necessarily an indictment of
"the Stanford debating system."
Its chief lesson is to prove anew the
necessity for devotion to the high
est ideals in the literary societies
and in the preparation of each team
when selected for the contest,
