# Stanford Men Enlist
## 
### 
A opening has been offered by
which Stanford students may pre
pare themselves to enter the ser
vice of their country in our present
war with Spain. A proposition
made by the captain of Company K.
of the Ist Regiment of the National
Guard of California through Mr.
C. li. Detrick, '97, opens up a prac
tical way for Stanford men to be
included in the first call for volun
teers from California.
Governor Budd has said that the
members of the organized militia
will be given the first opportunity
to enlist and Captain Cunningham
proposes to till up the full quota of
Company K. with Stanford men.
Company K. is one of the crack
companies of San Francisco and
now contains about sixty-five high
class men, but many of these would
be unable to go on account of fam
ily ties and like reasons, so that
there will be room for at least fifty
Stanford students. The captain
will be in room 7(5 Encinathis even
ing to enlist all those who desire
to do so. Uniforms and guns will
be sent down tomorrow and an
oflicer will be here to drill the re
cruits every evening until they are
called to the State encampment at
the Presidio. This call is expected
not later than Monday. At the
Presidio they will be drilled for
one month, after which time each
man will take a physical examina
tion and, if accepted, will be en
listed in the United States volun
teers for two years or less if the
war ends within that time.

have given their names for the
emergency list of Company K: W.
