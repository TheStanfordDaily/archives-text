Dear Madam'- In this hour of
our common loss —a loss which,
w I file in the course of nature inev
itable, falls none the less with
weight of a great bereavement—we,
the President and Faculty of the
Leland Stanford Junior University,
desire to remind, ourselves of the
many great and good deeds of
Judge Francis E. Spencer in life,
and to convey to you a sense of our
sorrow and sympathy in the afflic
tion of his death.
By a union of rare native and
acquired powers, he long ago made
himself the center of an influence
which extended from the home to
the community and from the com
munity to the public at large, ful
filling with success and honor the

high trusts that were reposed in
him. And in later years, by cheer
fully assuming, in accordance with
the earnest wish of its founders, a
share in the interests and respon
sibilities of this institution of learn
ing, as president ot iis Hoard of
Trustees, he showed that prevision
which looks beyond the present
generations and created a debt of
gratitude which only posterity can
repay. The University has lost .a
wise counsellor and a personal
friend. Be assured once more of
the kindly memory that abides here
for him who is gone, and ot our
trust that your sorrow may iind
some consolation in such memories
and in the larger hopes dictated by
faith and love.
David St auk Jordan.
