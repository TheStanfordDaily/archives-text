# BASEBALL SATURDAY.
## Decisive Game of the Intercollegiate Series to be Played at Recreation Park. 
### 
The final game of the baseball
series will be played Saturday at
8 p.m. on the Recreation Park
grounds. The game will not be
postponed on account of the P. A. A.
meet.
The Varsity nine has been prac
ticing all week under "Jack" Shee
han and "Hilly" McLaine. The
fielding of the men had shown some
deterioration owing to the idleness
of the previous week, but the men
soon regained their previous form.
The outfield is not up to the stand
ard but is improving every night.
Wight and Harris are laid off on
account of illness. Both are con
valescing, however, and will un
doubtedly be in the game on Satur
day.
Berkeley is displaying great in
terest in the final game and will
undoubtedly have a large crowd on
hand to yell and to explode tire
crackers.
The Stanford "rooters" are going
to give the team a rally at Encina
on Friday evening at 8 o'clock. A
large number from the University
should attend this game to bring
the championship to Stanford.
