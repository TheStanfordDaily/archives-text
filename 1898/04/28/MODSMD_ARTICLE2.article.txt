Editor Daily Palo Alto. —The
suggestion by member** of the fac
ulty appearing in last night's Daily
Palo Alto concerning the cause of
our defeats in debate were in
structive. The scientific method of
investigation is not at fault, hut it
must he accompanied by literary
training. Professor Hudson's al
lusion to Huxley in this connection
was exactly apropos. Let us con
tinue the work of the class in
Argumentation now so ably con
ducted by Professor Duniway, and
either enlarge it or form an addi
tional class for next year so as to
accommodate a larger number of
aspirants for college honors in de
bating.
The criticism of one of the pro
fessors was, however, not just. The
burden of his remarks was an at
tempt to show that the present
team were not representative stu
dents. Why?
1. Two of the men are married.
T ere is a ''seasoning" process con
nected with the institution «112 mar
riage that incapacitates a man for
debating. But notwithstanding
that fact the first choice of the
judges in our preliminaries fell
upon a married man. The other
man who had the misfortune to
be married failed to represent the
University on the rostrum in three
previous contests with U. C. On
each of these four occasions he was
duly chosen by an able faculty com
mittee of judges, and, if the testi
mony of his U. U. opponents and
of prominent men interested in de
bating, is woith anything at all,
he invariably did himself credit
and conferred no mean honor on
the University. Furthermore, he
certainly made an honorable show
ing by his generally acknowledged
able rebuttal in the victory of '97.
Again, Professor (iailey, who trains
the U. (J. debaters* unreservedly ex
pressed his opinion that this unfor

tunate unrepresentative student
last year won the Carnot medal,
and one of the judges voted for
him. After all the effort necessary
to make four intercollegiate teams,
and after making a highly credit
able showing in every contest, this
unfortunate man must feel strange
sensations of.surprise when he sud
denly learns from so high an au
thority as one of our own professors
that lie is not a representative stu
dent.
2 One of the team was not rep
resentative, because "he is a pro
fessional teacher." If this is an
argument of weight, then let us
throw ii]) the sponge immediately.
Our best trainers for debates are
Professors Duniway and Lathrop,
both of them professional teachers.
We are not at a disadvantage here,
however, for Professor Gailey of
U. 0. is also a "professional
teacher."
One of these married men of the
team is also a "practiced politician,"
so the professor "is informed." Out
in the cold world, such an allusion
as this would be a clear case of
"throwing mud," but the professor
of course meant no harm to the de
bater. If he means by the term a
man who, by hard and conscien
tious effort, lias won a coveted place
among the first debaters of the
University, then we may truthfully
say that we last year had two
"practiced politicians" on our team
—and that team planted the car
dinal banner high up on the cita
del of our(.pponents across the bay.
It is highly desirable that we
should criticize our representatives
in all contests, if they need it, and
there are few who can not profit by
some criticism, but it must be re
membered that to be effective the
criticism must be made with some
slight regard to tact. To publicly
announce that our men are not
representative students, and de
scribe them as ordained preachers,
professional teachers and practiced
politicians, is not to encourage de
bating in the future, to say nothing
of the feelings of the debaters criti
cized. Warren Hull.
Editor Daily Palo Alto.—Cer
tain professors who never by word
or deed aid our debaters before a
contest have shown themselves
ftiil of wise counsel since our de
feat of last Saturday evening. It
seems only tilting that the stu
dents, too, should have a fling at
the unfortunates who composed
our luckless team. Perhaps this
can best be done by reiterating
some of the helpful criticisms pub
lished in yesterday's Daily Palo
Alto.
That our debaters are in no sense
typical of the debating interests of
the University is clearly true. All
of them are members of the class
in Oral Discussion; all of them are
members of literary societies; one
of them has represented Stanford
in four intercollegiate debates, and
all of them won their places on the
team in an open competition in
which twenty-live other debaters
participated. It is thought that
this criticism will be exceedingly
helpful to our next year's team.
In the second place, every one
recognizes, of course, that our de
baters should concentrate their at-

tention in the future upon acquir
ing literary polish and elegance of
stage presence. This is especially
emphasized at the present time by
the fact that U. C. excelled us in
the debate of last Saturday above
all other things in argument, as
distinct fro n form (a fact that
General Chipman mentioned in
rendering the decision), and by
the fact that her strongest debater
had the poorest stage presence, was
the least polished of the three.
Another criticism of our this
year's team is that they expended
neither time nor energy in prepa
ration. It is an open secret that
their class work for this semester
has been of exceedingly high grade,
and the commendation with which
it has been received by some of
their professors is very pleasant to
them. This is entirely different
from the condition of things at
Berkeley. There debaters give a
great deal of time to preparing for
the debate, and are, it is said, en
couraged by the faculty in so
doing.
Finally, some members of the
faculty are doing a great deal to
raise the plane of debating in the
University; their work ami their
criticism is highly appreciated by
the students. The disparaging
criticism of others, after a lost de
bate. is not so highly valued as
would be helpful criticism before
the contest. Even such as it is,
we think it might be improved if
made as a result of that scientific
method from which, it is said, our
debaters suffer. .J. T. Bukoiiam.
Editor Daily Palo Alto. —In
trying to remedy the faults of our
debating system we must speak
plain facts. If we hit any one, it is
not because we love them less but
Stanford more.
To begin with, our defeat did not
take place at Metropolitan Temple
last Saturday, but at our prelimi
naries weeks before our meet with
Berkeley.
We have never selected a team
that worked harder than this one.
We have never had three more con
scientious men than the three that
represented us on the rostrum fast
Saturday night. But, they were
not debaters.
One of the members of the fac
ulty stated in yesterday's Palo
Alto that we did not secure de
baters of the proper type. This is
true, yet the method he suggests of
improving that type is rather pe
culiar. lie says: "One (of the de
baters) is a practiced politician,
the second a professional teacher,
and the third an ordained
preacher." Is this then the weak
ness of our team ? If so, how
does it happen that last, year with
two practiced politicians in her
team Stanford reached her highest
mark in debating skill? Again he
says, "In a college debate this very
seasoning is prejudicial to our in
terests/' This is satisfactory "lit
erary" reasoning indeed. If too
much training is the cause of our
defeat, we can easily find a suit
able remedy.
It is useless to deny, however,
that faults do exist in our system.
It has been demonstrated that we
must bring out our best men if we
intend to win from Berkeley. Our

present system of choosing speak
ers will not give us this result.
Three changes will have to be
made to produce it:
First —We must have in the pre
liminaries semi-final contests from
which shall be chosen a certain
number of speakers to go into the
finals, when they shall debate for
final honors with those debaters
whose previous reputations have
excused them from the semi-finals.
If this plan is carried into execu
tion a man will not lose his place
on the team because he is ill dur
ing one of his speeches. He will
have a chance to retrieve himself.
Again, a new man can not gain a
place by one brilliant speech. He
must demonstrate that he can re
peat his performance.
Second —In selecting prelimi
nary judges we must get men who
discriminate between the mind that
can grasp a subject in all it broad
ness, taking in every detail, and
the intellect that can concentrate
its entire energy upon the few es
sential points and drive these home
to the judges.
Third—lnterest must be aroused
among both students and faculty.
The necessity of enthusiasm is
mentioned often enough nowadays.
Its necessity is known.
E. H. Rothrook.
