# Value of the Hildebrand Library.

### 
Professor Goebel has lately re
ceived the lir*t installment of that
part of Grimm's Dictionary of which
Hildebrand, whose library we po
sess, was the editor This all-in
clusive work was begun in 1854
and carried on by the brothers
Grimm until 1865, when Hilde
brand took it in charge. At the
time of the founding of the German
Empire the government became
financially responsible for the work.
Hildebrand's work is being con
tinued by Professor Wunderlich,
professor of the German language
and literature at Heidelberg. The
following extract from the preface
to the portion now out may be of
interest to Stanford students.
Regarding the difficulty of being
the successor of a master like Hilde
brand, the professor writes: "Who
would dare even to imitate the
peculiar charm of Hildebrand's
style? Who would dare to choose
the same roads as those upon
which the experience of a rich life
guided him safely? From the
beginning I have given up the idea
of attempting the impossible and
have decided to work upon a differ
ent plan."
One of the chief reasons why the
successor can not compete with
Hildebrand is the fact that he does
not possess the latter's library.
"Hildebrand's collections," says
Professor Wunderlich, "were mostly
entered into the copies of his li
brary, though part of them were
contained in the marvelous memory

of the man. It must forever be de
plored that the library has been
sold to America, but the German
government took cure that Hilde
brand's notes to the chief copies of
his library were carefully copied by
a German scholar. In this way I
got some important material, but
in general 1 had to gather my
material as best I could. I must
confess that the splendid library
I sold to America is a most serious
loss to Germany."
