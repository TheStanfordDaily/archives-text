# Tuesday Evening Lecture.

### 
The lecture Tuesday evening was
a very interesting account, histori
cal and critical, of the life of
Emile Zola, of whom Professor
Davidson spoke in part as follows:
"(juy de Maupassant, one of the
greatest pupils of ihe master of
whom 1 am going to speak to you
tonight, comments on the curious
music in the name Emile Zola. 'It
sounds,' he said, Mike a cry of de
fiance, a challenge, a battle shout:
Zola!' If this impression he cor
rect, then indeed the name is sym
bolic of the man, for Zola has all
his life long been a tighter —a com
batant with poverty, the champion
of a new literary creed, and lastly,
in the minds of all lovers of jus
tice and self-sacrifice by no means
least, the defender of a fellow man
unjustly condemned to worse than
death." •
After giving a sketch of the dra
matic incidents of the Dreyfus case
and Zola's subsequent arrest, the
lecturer went back to the novelist's
early life. Zola was born in 1840
in l'aris of a Venetian father and
a French mother. He spent his
vouth in Aix, a city of I'rovence,
and it is said thai he retains to < bis
day a slightly southern accent.
Returning to l'aris in IBO.S he com
pleted his studies, and it may be
a source of satisfaction to some of
us to know that the future great
novelist failed in his filial exami
nation.
Now began the struggle for life,
and a bitter struggle it was. Verse,
art criticism, and short stories of
indifferent quality came from his
pen until Balzac's "Human Com
edy" aroused Zola's ambition to
achieve a similar success by
writing m Human Tragedy: the
tragedy of heredity. This one
word, heredity, is the key to the
understanding of this gigantic
work which, once planned, was
carried through more than a scon
of years to triumphant completion.
Alter characterizing certain of the
books of this twenty volume series,
tlie lecturer continued: In spite of
his position as the leader of the rea
listic school of fiction in France,
Zola is nevertheless an idealist and
a poet. Many class Zola as an
epic poet rather than as a novelist,
and consider the series of the
Rougon-Macquart the epic of he
red i t y.
As to his personality: A small,
thin man, nervous in manner, with
terrible wrinkles all over his face,
he looks like an ascetic, a man of
sorrow. It is only when speaking
on any subject in which he is
greatly interested that his pale and
careworn face lights up, that his
remarkable eyes Hash lire, and the
inner man betrays himself through
his msigiiilicant envelope. llis
head resembles an old Italian por
trait. llis short hair retreats from
a rather lolty brow. His rather
broad face is full-bearded, anil his
lips are sometimes curved in a half
droll, half ironical smile.
Zola is married, and devoted to
his wife, who is noted for her char
ity and her interest in the peasants
living near their country home.
They have no children, llis lite is
extiemely simple, that of an ex
emplary citizen in good circum
stances. His capacity for work is
extraordinary.
May this l>rief description, said
tlie the lecturer, avail as a partial
refutation of the unfounded attacks
upon his private life. Zola himself
say- that a loose liver always writes
proper books, while the man whose
life is above reproach makes up for
it by writing novels that shock the
prudish mind.
