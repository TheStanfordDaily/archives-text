HENKV 11. HYDE, President
The Equitable Society has a SURPLUS of $50,543,175, and is the strongest life
assurance company in the world. This is a point of the first importance, since
life assurance contracts may not mature for many years after they have been
entered into by the contract irig pat-ties
The advantage enjoyed by the Equitable Society inconsequence of its large
surplus and superior tinanciai strength deserves, at this time, special attention
for another reason: the Society now offers to the assuring public a new form of
policy, whose most striking characteristic is that a great number of exceed
ingly valuable aud definite GUARANTEES are embodied in the contract. Any
guarantee made by it company with a surplus exceeding FIFTY MILLION
DOLLARS is obviously worth more than would be the promise of a company of
limited resources, or of one whose management had been such as to impair its
financial strength.
