# JUNIOR CLASS DAY.
## The
						Farce, Prom., and "Quad" of the Class of '99 Come to a Successful Completion. 
### 
The Stanford Quad, '99, made
its appearance today and fulfilled
all the predictions that had been
made that it would far surpass its
predecessors both in typographical
execution and also in arrangement
and literary form. The book is
dedicated to President Jordan, of
whom an excellent half-tone ap
pears as a frontispiece. Professor
Hudson has contributed a very
true and interesting sketch of Dr.
Jordan as a man, which accom
panies the picture. The title page
•is done in colors, and is exceed
ingly neat.
Editor Chris M. Bradley and
Manager Fred H. Greenebaum de
serve the greatest credit for their
success. No management has been
handicapped in a like manner and
accomplished such results. Not
until late in this semester was the
class able to respond with financial
aid, and the book is really the
product of two months' work.
Editor Bradley has always been
an active '99 man. He has filled
various class otfices, represented
his class on the Executive Commit
tee, in the Press Club, Sword and
Sandals, the Junior Farce, on Josh,
the Sequoia, and the Daily Palo
Alto, on which during the present
semester he has filled the position
of managing editor. Mr. Bradley
is a man of enthusiasm, has always
been a leader and a worker in
arousing spirit in the class, as well
as the University, and the '99
Quad will stand as a mark of his
energy and versatility. Mr. Greene
baum has proved a business man
of extraordinary ability, bringing
out the book financially successful
with only $250 aid from the class.
He has at all times been careful
and conservative.
The Board of Editors iB com
posed of J. F. Abbott, managing
editor; Miss Markhani, Miss Brun
ton, H. T. Brantley, R. E. Filcher,
C. E. Schwartz, E. W. Smith, 0. C.
Leiter, associate editors; and A. J.
Van Kaathoven, artist.
The literary material is of a high
class. In addition to the clever
prize story, "His Olympian Rival,"
by Wallace Irwin, there are con
tained the second-prize story, "A
Case of Circumstantial Evidence,"
by Bristow Adams, and ''The Mis
sion Kid, A.8.," by J. M. Oskison.
The "History of '99" gives a clear
account of the activity and accom
plishments of the class.
Poems and verse abound. Bris
tow Adam's sonnet, "Raphael to
Fornarina," the prize poem, with
drawings by himself, is the most
ambitious attempt. Among the
contributed verse, humorous and
otherwise, are "The House of
Dreams" by E. M. Hulme, '97,
"The Shepherdess" by G. H. Yost,
admirably illustrated by Miss
Holly, "A Letter" by W. A. Irwin,
"To an Old Portrait" by C. K.
Field,'9s, "Ad Alumnos" by W.
H. Irwin, "A Mystery Solved" by
Bristow Adams, "In Graduate
Days" by Sarah Comstock, '96,
"Life's a Grind" by J. K. Konnell,
and "Student's Carrol,"anonymous.
The art work is superior to that

of other annuals. R. K. Culver, '99,
has contributed much of his dis
tinctive work, and has added
greatly to the success of the book.
Bristow Adams is a close second
with a style equally distinctive yet
wholly original. All of the artists
deserve great credit: Misses Hyde,
Morton, Holley, Louise Culver, and
Messrs. Van Kaathoven, staff artist,
Bowman, Lawsh£, \V. K. Fisher,
Boroughs, Briscoe, and Bonnell.
The usual fraternity, society, and
team pictures, the '99 Class-photo
graph, athletic and University sta
tistics, and most interesting of all,
the grinds, are contained.
The book is almost typographi
cally perfect. The binding and
paper are of the best quality. The
half-tones are excellent and are
printed in tints. The book is from
the press of Louis Roesch and the
bindery of Hicks, Judd <fc Co.
