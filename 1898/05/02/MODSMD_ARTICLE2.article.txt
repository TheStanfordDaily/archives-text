# Junior Farce.

### 
The Junior Farce, "The Bone of
Contention," by Wallace Irwin, was
successfully rendered Thursday
evening by the cast chosen with but
two exceptions from the Class of
'99. The farce was well attended
and went off without a hitch. The
management deserves great credit
for the successful performance.
J. K. Bonnell as "Euripides
Tabb," and "John Smith" of the
Daily Palo Alto made the hit
of the evening. He sustained very
cleverly both characters, and many
in the audience failed to recognize
him in his dual part. G. T. For
syth was inimitable as the darkie
porter, and C. M. Bradley as the
Reverend Bildad Burble, founder
of a society for the "Mutual Preser
vation of Freshmen and the Pre
vention of Rushing" also scored a
decided hit. W. Erb as "Teddie
North" played his part very natur
ally and was well sustained by F.
F. Rogers as "Bob Millinger." Miss
Ferrel as "Mrs. Susan Tabb" had
a difficult part which she took with
ease. Misses MacMillan and
Lewis took their parts very grace
fully. The nine school-marm
specials formed a pleasing back
ground for several scenes.
The rush at the end of the sec
ond act between the '99 and the
'00 Classes was very realistic, and
the rushers fought with despera
tion even after the curtain was
rung down. The whole farce was
cleverly acted and was one of the
most successful ever given here,
due in a large part to the work of
W. 11. Irwin as stage manager.
Financially the management
cleared about $10. The committee
in charge was H. T. Brantley, Mi 1-
nor Roberts, E. S. Williams, A. B.
West, and R. A. Leiter, chairman.
