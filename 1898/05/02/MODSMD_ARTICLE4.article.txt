# CHAMPIONSHIP WON.
## Varsity Nine Defeats U.C., 6-5, and Establishes Our Supremacy on the Diamond. 
### 
Stanford won the third game of
the series and the intercollegiate
championship on Saturday in the
closest and most exciting game
ever played between the two uni
versities. Berkeley was on hand,
as usual, with rooters and fire
crackers. The latter, however, ac
cidentally exploded in one of the
early innings, to the great delight
of the Stanford adherents.

The Stanford rooters were quiet
up to the fifth and seemed to have
given up hope. It required all the
energy of the yell leaders, Hay den
and Erb, to arouse them. From
the fifth inning on the yelling was
the best ever heard at an intercol
legiate ball game.
Berkeley was first at bat. Mein
was safe on a sharp hit to pitcher,
was advanced on Hoag's sacrifice,
took third on a wild pitch, and
scored on Cheesebrough's sacrifice.
In the third, with one out, Baer
lined out a two-biigger, went to
third on a wild pitch, and tallied
on Mein's sacrifice.
Stanford could not score the first
four times, although men were on
bases each inning. In the fifth
Beckett singled, Lougheed fanned,
Strohn hit to pitcher, forcing Beck
ett at second. Wight secured a
double, scoring Strohn. Swindells
singled, and followed Wight across
the plate on Young's two-bagger.
This made the score stand Stan
ford 3, California 2.

In the next inning, with two out,
Hoag made the circuit on u long
hit to left. Swindells dropped
Cheesebrough's fly. Bride and
Kaarsburg singled, bringing in two
runs. The score then read Berke
ley 5, Stanford 3.
In the seventh Swindells received
a pass to first. Young singled.
Both advanced on McLaren's muff
and scored on Kaarsburg's error.
Murphy got a two-bagger, stole
third, and beat McCabe's throw of
Klauber's grounder to the plate.
No more runs resulted in the re
mainder of the game. Stanford
was superior in every respect. The
greatest defect was the seemingly
careless manner in which bases
were run. Beckett pitched his best
game against Berkeley on Satur
day. lie was as deceptive as ever
and particularly steady. Strohn
caught his usual excellent game.
Young's playing was a fitting end
ing to his magnificent work this
season. Lougheed, Harris, and
Klauber proved a veritable stone
wall, through which no grounders
could pass. Murphy, Wight, and
Young led in stick work, the first
getting three hits out of four times
at bat.
