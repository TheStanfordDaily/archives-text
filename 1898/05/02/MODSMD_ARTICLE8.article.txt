The baseball men deserve the
thanks of the student body for the
brilliant victory Saturday, whereby
the championship was again
brought home to Stanford. The
season has been a hard one; the
team took a long time to reach
Varsity form and to play as a
unit, but the spirit of the men and
the determination to win a victory
finally resulted in achieving suc
cess. The last game was an up-hill
fight; the whole series was an up
hill fight, the kind we like t<> win.
The greatest credit is due to Coach
Sheehan, whose spirit and enthusi
asm has had a wonderful effect on
the team. The successful termina
tion of the season is especially
pleasing in a semester marked by
disaster and defeat.
