THE EQUITABLE LIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY
OF THE UNITED STATES
120 Broadway, New York Organized 1859
January I, 1898
The Largest, Strongest, Most Popular, Thoroughly Mutual, and Economically Managed Life Insurance Company in the Worlo
Outstanding Assurance
New Assurance Written in 1897
Income in 1897 ....
Paid to Policy Holders
Undivided Surplus on four per cent. Standard
$951,165,837
156,955,693
48,572,260
21,1(16,314
50,543,175
The Business oi the Society is Conducted on the Mutual All Cash Plan
Ever}' Tontine Policy issued by the Equitable Society
twenty years ago, whose Tontine period expires in 181)8, has
a present cash surrender value Greater than the Sum
of the Premiums Paid.
All 20-year Tontine Endowment Policies show a return
of the premiums paid, with interest at rates between 6
and 7 per cent, per Annum.
The Equitable Society has a SURPLUS of $50,543,175, and is the strongest life
assurance company in the world. This is a point of the first importance, since
life assurance contracts may not mature for many years after they have been
entered into by the contracting parties
The advantage enjoyed by Ihe Equitable Society in consequence of its large
surplus and superior linanciai strength deserves, at this time, special attention
for another reason: the Society now offers to the assuring public a new form of
policy, whose most striking characteristic is that a great number of exceed
ingly valuable and definite GUARANTEES are embodied in the contract. Any
guarantee made by a company with a surplus exceeding FIFTY MILLION
DOLLARS is obviously worth more than would be the promise of a company of
limited resources, or of one whose management had been such as to impair its
financial strength.
