A new contract for Recreation
Park football grounds has been
made in place of the old one. The
football managers lirst obtained
terms from Central Park and after
wards obtained satisfactory terms
from Ueereatiou Park, which have

been accepted. By the terms of
the new contract the universities
have complete control of the
grounds on days when games are
to be played and furnish their own
seats. J n this way much of the
confusion of previous years can be
avoided.
Manager Prichard said in an in
terview today regarding plans for
the grounds next year:
"To avoid accident from falling
timbers canvas will be used as a
covering for temporary grand
stands, and particular attention
will be paid to comfortable seating
and convenience of entrance.
Recreation Park is now incorpor
ated under the State laws, and the
company has a three-year lease of
the grounds. The grounds are
much improved over Inst year,
and all things considered, we are
pleased with the new deal.
''Some of our football players are
going to take footballs home dur
ing the summer for practice in
punting, and several promising
candidates for Guiby's successor
to rip have declared their inten
tion of entering Stanford next
yea r."
