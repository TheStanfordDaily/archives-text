# MODERN WARSHIPS.
## Entertaining Lecture Last Evening by Irving M. Scott on Ships We Fight With. 
### 
A large crowd greeted Irving M.
Scott in the chapel hist night to
hear his lecture on " The Ships We
Fight With," illustrated by a very
complete set of lantern slides. The
present trouble with Spain gave
his subject special interest, and
his words of patriotism in opening
and closing were met with ap
plause and cheers.
"I propose tonight," said the
lecturer, "to give you an idea of
what your country is, how it came
to be, and how we can defend it."
In tracing the growth of the United
States maps were shown of the
thirteen original states and of sub
sequent acquisitions by purchase,
conquest, and cession. The lectur
er's remarks showed his sympathy
for Cuba, and also his belief that
in view of England's policy we
should annex Hawaii.
Before showing pictures of mod
ern ships for defence, the lecturer
fave views of the old fashioned
sailing vessels, the Constitution,
the * Constellation, the Alabama,
and the Kearsage, which was the
best warship in America at the
time of the Rebellion. Then came
the far-famed Monitor in its en
counter with the Merrimac. The
former was the first ironclad bat
tleship, and by its success it
destroyed the fighting value of all
ships in all navies.
The lecture proper was a descrip
tion of the modern warships as
represented by the seven which
have been built on this coast, the
Charleston, San Francisco, Mon
terey, Olympia, Wheeling, Mari
etta, and the Oregon. The Charles
ton was made according to English
plans, but beat the English record
for unarmored cruisers by half a
knot "with less power. The San
Francisco, now flagship of the
American squadron, is the first all
round ship of the American navy,
carrying an effective battery of six
inch guns and having a speed of
nineteen and a half knots. The
Monterey, with its two turrets and
heavy guns, has a speed six knots
faster than any previous monitor.
The Olympia is furnished with
fighting platforms on the mast
littted with rapid-firing guns. Her
speed is unusual, being 22:15
knots, and her build is such that
she can turn around in her own
length.
Enthusiastic cheers greeted the
portrait of Commodore Dewey,
"the man," said Mr. Scott, "who
has lifted the American flag higher
in the Orient than it has been for
the last one hundred years."
The Wheeling and the Marietta
iire small cruisers intended to act
ns convoys to larger vessels. The
[Oregon is fitted with a hollow
lighting mast. She carries four
13-inch, eight 8-inch, and two 6-
inch guns, beside a strong second
ary battery.
Mr. Scott next explained tor
pedos and torpedo boats, and
showed pictures of the Union Iron
Works in San Francisco and the
gun works at Bethlehem, I'enn.,
illustrating various steps in ship

building and the making of big
guns and of the armor plate. After
giving three cheers for President
McKinley and three for Irving M.
Scott, the audience closed by sing
ing the "Battle Hymn of the Re
public."
Mr. Sam C. Partridge, an expert
lantern operator of San Fran
cisco, had charge of the illustra
tion of Mr. Scott's lecture, and
his skill and excellent service con
tributed materially to the pleasure
of the evening.
