# Departure of the Stanford Company.
## 
### 
Those Stanford students who
have joined Company K of the
state militia left the University
this morning and took the 8:30
train for the city. They will there
he examined and those physically
able will he mustered into the regu
lar United States army. They ex
pe t to he called soon to the I'hil
lipine Islands for active service.
A larve crowd of Stanford stu
dents had gathered at the depot to
hid the boys good-bye, and the last
thing the soldiers heard as the
train pulled out was the Stanford
yell. A pleasing hit of sentiment
was the action of the Palo Alto
Boys' Brigade. It. assembled at
the station, anil asked permission

of Sergeant Farless to salute the
college company. The space was
cleared and the salute given. The
men of Company lv returne'! the
compliment and the school hoys
marched away thoroughly im
pressed.
