# Professor Griggs in Marin County.
## 
### 
On Wednesday Professor Griggs
addressed the Marin County Teach
ers' Institute now in session at San
Rafael, in the morning on "Direct
and indirect ethical instruction"
and in the afternoon on''The train
ing of American citizenship." The
address in the afternoon aroused
considerable discussion and com
mendation. Professor Griggs held
that true patriotism would pre
vent any one from supporting any
course which his own nation might
take if it militated against the hest
interests of the rest of the civilized
world or humanity generally.
