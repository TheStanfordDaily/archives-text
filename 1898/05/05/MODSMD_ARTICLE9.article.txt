# Changes on the Campus.

### 
Mrs. Stanford has placed a large
painting of Leland Stanford Jr. in
the club-room of Encina Hall, and
will soon add a painting of Senator
Stanford and other paintings to the
collection of the room.
In a recent conversation Mrs.
Stanford stated that work would
soon begin on the new Assembly
Hall and the Library buildings,
probably within a month. The
Library building will be placed di
rectly in front of the building of
the quad at present used for the
library, and the Assembly Hall
will be opposite this and in front
of the Registrar's office. Both will
he in line with Encina and Roble,
and will be connected by an im
mense arch. As soon as these are
completed work will be continued

on the outer quadrangle, which will
be faced by an arcade similar to
that inside the quad.
The Sigma Nil house and the
Faculty Bachelor's Club-house will
be moved beyond the road and all
the space east of Alvarado row
will be reserved for the students'
athletic grounds.
