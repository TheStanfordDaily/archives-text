Practically a
NEW RAILWAY
Trains leave from and arrive at
Market St, Ferry J
THE BEST RAILWAY
California to Chicago
And the only line owning its own tracks, California to Chi
cago. New rails, new ties, new ballast, new bridges. No
dust. The shortest crossing of the desert and a country that
interests by its varied and beautiful scenery. The highest
grade of passenger equipment-and meals at Harvey's famous
dining-rooms.
Through Pullman Palace and Tourist Sleepers every day
in the year. Through tickets, and baggage checked from
Palo Alto to any point East. No other line affords so many
inducements to the traveler as the
Great Santa Fe Route
Illustrated pamphlets, folders, etc., descriptive of the route, mailed free
on application.
