of the premiums paid, with interest at rates between 6
and 7 per cent, per Annum.
The Equitable Society has a SURPLUS of $50,543,175, and is the strongest life
assurance company in the world. This is a point of the first importance, since
life assurance contracts may not mature for many years after they have been
entered into by the contracting parties
The advantage enjoyed by the Equitable Society inconsequence of its large
surplus and superior financial strength deserves, at this time, special attention
for another reason: the Society now offers to the assuring public a new form of
policy, whose most striking characteristic! is that a great number of exceed
iuirly valuable and definite QUAUANTEKS tire embodied in the contract,. Any
guarantee made by a company with a surplus exceeding FIFTY MILLION
DOLLARS is obviously worth more than would be the promise of a company of
limited resources, or of one whose management had been such as to impair its
financial strength.
