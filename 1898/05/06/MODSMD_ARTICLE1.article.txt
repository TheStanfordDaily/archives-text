mittee this afternoon that body
voted a Varsity sweater to Paul E.

the past two years,and in his capa
city as captain of the track team
this year.
F. S. Fisher was appointed a com
mittee of one to have the silver foot
bail which is now in possession of
the Stanford team suitably en
graved, as the University Club in
the city has provided. The same
will probably he placed in a suit
able case, among our other tro
phies in Encina Club.
H. E. Lougheed, C. S. Dole, and
F. S. Fisher were appointed a. com
mittee to investigate the advisabil
ity of an athletic cap for our ath
letes which shall be a distinguish
ing mark of athletic ability, similar
to the Varsity sweater. A com
mittee consisting of 11. E. Lougheed
and F. S. Fisher was appointed to
consider the advisability of keep
ing our football and baseball fields
separate so as to do away with the
expense of working over,for the two
different, purposes.
