### 
Students who are thinking of
taking work in the above school
this summer would do well to con
sult with the respective instructors
as io details. While the announce
ment booklet mentions all general
matters,, individual students may
desire ~ information on special
points. Such information the in
structors are ready to give, by in
terview or letter.
Mr. XV. K. Hyde of the Univer
sity Bookstore has arranged for the
deposit of a stock of books and
supplies to be used in the summer
school with Mr. Tuttle, druggist
and stationer of Pacific Grove.
This will preclude all unncessary
delay. Mr. Hyde himself will h.'ve
charge of this stock, and orders for
any books or materials will be at
tended to as at the University.
