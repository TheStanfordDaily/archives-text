# Policy of Next Year's "Sequoia."
## 
### 
The editor of next year's Sequoia,
Mr. Bristow Adams, '00, has plan
ned the paper for 1898-99 on
strictly literary lines and promises
an excellent magazine. Mr. Adams
has had considerable experience in
writing, having been engaged in
journalism before corning to college.
He gave up an editorship on the
national weekly review The Path
finder, Washington D. C., of which
he was one of the originators, to
come to Stanford. Since coming
here he has been connected with
both college publications, having
heen assistant editor on the Daily
Palo Alto and associate editor of
the Sequoia in his freshman year,
and this year assistant on the Se
quoia and associate on the Palo
Alto.
When seen regarding next year's
weekly, he outlined a policy some
what as follows:
''The first aim of Sequoia, for
1898-99 will be to please its Stan
ford patrons, and the management
considers it can best do this by
making it a literary magazine first
and foremost, its aim will be to
rettact undergraduate life, Stanford
life, and to form the medium for
the literary expression of the stu
dents. As far as possible, too, it
will reflect the art tendencies, and
will publish meritorious drawings
and illustrations.
"Specifically, it will have a new
and artistic c>ver design and per
haps a series of them; the regular
departments wiil be ones that will
largely take the place of the present
ones. There will be a page of ma
terial in lighter vein to be known
probably as "Between Classes," and
the exchange and editorial de
partments will be kept up.
"An effort will be made to get
more good prose and some less
verse, though the Sequoia's reputa
tion for good poetry will not be al
lowed to suffer; the difference will
be made in the quantity and not
the quality.
"To sum up, the management
hopes to present the best paper
Stanford has yet had, and one that
will stand at the very top of the
list of college publications."
