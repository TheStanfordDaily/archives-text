# A 						COMMUNICATION.
## An Answer to the "Holy Man in Politics" and Reflections on College Politics. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto. —Cer-
tain articles have appeared in the
Sequoia during the past year which
are deserving of comment before
the school year closes. Their gen
eral tone and effect have been such
that they should not be allowed to
pass entirely unchallenged.
Outside readers of the Sequoia
have marveled this year that some
of the things which have been
printed in thai paper under the
head of "Evenings with Maud"
should be tolerated by University
people. They have wondered if
University men and women like to
read such stuff. To many of us
here at Stanford, also, il has ap
peared entirely out of place fora
University paper to give up its
space to tfie sort o! literature
which is already plentifully sup
plied in cheap French novels.
Many of the things which "Pan
Dora" has written contain little
but evil suggestion, with no bear
ing on University file. They are
open to the strong objection that
the suggestion of evil is often
worse than evil itself.
In line with the general charac
ter of the articles by "Pan Dora" is
the mysterious suggestion of evil
contained in"The Holy Man in
Politics." No one will maintain
that the students who take an ac
tive interest in politics here are
angelic individuals, but there are
few persons who are ready to be
lieve that some of the brightest
men in our University are "liars,
shysters, and hypocrites." The
influence of such talk upon
people here is small, but our Uni
versity papers go forth to represent
us throughout the length and
breadth of the land, and outsiders
have no other means of judging of
our University life. Instead of
holding up the honor of his alma
mater, the editor of the Sequoia
has been stabbing her honor to the
heart.
It is impossible for any one to
reply specifically to the articles
referred to because no specific
charges are made. The means of
accusation used is that of indirect
suggestion. Most of us admire a
man who comes out boldly and
openly against what he believes to
be wrong, but few of us have any
other feeling than that of contempt
for the man who makes his attacks
in the dark.
Among other things it is inti
mated in these articles that the
leaders in Christian Endeavor
work, both in the chapel and in
Palo Alto, are in religion for polit
ical purposes. What must be the
idea of outside people who are
made to believe that those who
take an active part in Christian
work here do so for the sake of
securing a few votes for some petty
student body office 1
It may be well asked why the
word "ring" is made so much of in
these articles. "Ring" is a term of
reproach in politics both here and
outside. The editor of the Sequoia
knows as well as any one else that
the surest way to defeat any candi
date is to connect him with a

"ring." But what does he meat)
by a "ring''? A "ring" in politics
usually secures control through il
legal or corrupt methods. If such
methods have ever been used here
the offense is one which should cer
tainly call for an investigation on
the part of the faculty. 1 feel sure
that no one who has been elected
to any office here this year would
hesitate for one moment to go be
fore the president of the University
or before any faculty committee ap
pointed by 11im and tell everything
lie knows about student body poli
tics and methods. Before such a
non-partisiui committee 1 believe
that evecy successful candidate
could vindicate himself, no matter
what charges might be brought up
against him.
But if the author means by a
"ring" that a few men are looked
to on account of their standing and
personality as leaders in student
body affairs, that is quite another
matter. It is nothing more than
natural that the influence of those
most interested in student body
matters should radiate out among
those who are less interested. But
there is little danger in such a con
dition of affairs, because such men
must command the confidence and
respect of the students as a whole
if their influence is to amount to
anything.
There is no reason why there
should not be honest difference of
opinion in regard to student body
matters. Every one who has
studied the situation here knows
perfectly well that there is at the
present time such a difference of
opinion. Hut the leaders on both
sides have been honorable men
actuated by honest motives; and
none of them are, in my opinion,
either "liars, shysters, or hypo
crites."
In politics here, as elsewhere,
there is, of course, always the ob
jection that a man is sometimes
supported by his friends for an
office simply out of friendship and
regardless of his qualifications.
While this is to a slight degree an
evil, it is not by any means the
evil which we have to fear.
Friendship is a positive force, and
so long as a man is elected to an
office because he has numerous
friends no great harm can result.
But there js another force at work
which has in it nothing but evil.
Into college politics there can
never enter the corrupt and venal
influences which sometimes play a
part in political questions outside,
but there is a corresponding in
fluence which needs watching just
as closely. It is too often the case
that the motives which ii Huence
certain individuals in student
body politics are not the welfare
of student interests, are not even
so positive a force as friendship;
but torn by the pangs of jealousy
they do everything in their power
to pull down some one whose prog
ress arouses their envy. This is
what leads to destructive campaigns
instead of constructive campaigns.
The evils in politics here do not
come from the work which is done
for candidates, but they result
from the work which is done
against candidates.
it is hardly becoming in the edi

tor of the Sequoia to talk about
political scheming. The very ar
ticles referred to constitute the most
gigantic attempt to influence ari
election ever made at Stanford
