# Freshmen Will.

### 
The Freshman track team won a
hotly contested field-day from the
University of Nevada at Reno on
Saturday hy a score of to 274,
ihe fraction being made hy a tie
for second place in the 220-yard
dash between Cantwell of Stanford
and Moorman of Nevada. While
many of the events were not close,
the filial score giving either side a
victory was in doubt until the last
moment.
The meet was held upon a mile
horse-track which allowed a 220
straight away, and which being
rolled hard near the pole, made a
very fast track.
As the Freshmen took no wheel
riders both bicycle events were
scratched, Stanford defaulting four
points.
The stars of the day were Moor
man of Nevada and Stuart and
Strout of Stanford, each of whom
won three events.
Stuart won all three sprints with
ease, his best work being in the
220, for which distance he was
credited with 22 3-5 seconds.
Sirout took both hurdles and the
half with equal ease, while Lous
ley won the walk handily after
trailing his man until within one
hundred yards of the finish.
Moorman, Nevada's best all
round man, was seen in many track
and field events. He succeeded in
winning the last two events, the
shot put and the pole vault, after a
pretty contest with Weatherwax in
the latter, both going 9 feet, 7
inches.
On the whole the sagebrush lads
showed up better than was expected,
and while their work gave evidence
of great lack in form and in knowl
edge of competition, yet the mater
ial at the university can be devel
oped into quite it respectable team
by hard work and plenty of compe
tition.
The freshmen showed up much
better than in their previous con
test- with the O. H. S. team, every
man doing his best.
Hoffman of California and Dole
of Stanford gave a pretty exhibition
in the high jump and pole vault,
clearing 5 feet 9 inches in the for
mer and 10 feet (i inches in the lat
ter event. Contra ry to expectation
the altitude did not affect the team
to any appreciable extent.
in other than the athletic side
the trip was also a great success.
