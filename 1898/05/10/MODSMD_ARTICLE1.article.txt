# ANSWER TO MR. SCHWARTZ.
## The 						Editor of the "Sequoia" Answers the Criticisms of the "Holy Man in Politics." 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto. —The
communication in Monday's paper
by Mr. Schwartz seems to call for
some reply on my part. It consti
tutes, as 1 take it, a general ar
raignment of my policy as editor
of the Sequoia this year and a speci
fic attack on me as author of ''The
Holy Man in Politics." With re
gard to the statement that through
their suggestion of evil "'Evenings
with Maud" and other articles
have been worse than evil itself, 1
need not reply. The evidence is
before the student body. It can
judge.
The charges against me as au
thor of "The lloiy Man in olitics'*
1 shall answer fully and in detail.
It is charged, tirst, that through
the influence of my story abroad
"instead of holding up the honor
of his alma mater the editor of the
Sequoia has been stabbing her
honor to the heart," and, second,
through the influence of the story
here: "It is hardly becoming of the
editor of the Sequoia to talk about
political scheming. The very arti
cles referred to constitute the most
gigantic attempt to influence an
election ever made at Stanford."
In reply to the first, 1 will say
that if the suggestions of evil are
not true then 1 have dishonored
my alma mater. In regard to the
second, I acknowledge that the
article was written with the pur
pose of influencing student body
elections. My purpose in writing
the story was to suggest evils which
1 know to exist to the students at
large, who do not, in order to give
them an understanding of the in
side of student body politics. I
was confident that if the voters
knew the methods which have
been used in politics here in the
past, the evil tendencies which I
saw would cease to exist. The ob
ject then was primarily educative.
The evils which I attacked are
pledging votes, working for un
qualified men, and influencing
voters by other than legitimate
arguments regarding the relative
qualifications of candidates. My
idea in writing was that if every
body would vote for the man Un
considered best qualified, regard
less of affiliations or solicitations,
the best men would be elected and
trades could not be made. To ac
complish this it was necessary to
make the students understand
conditions and realize their respon
sibility. That was my purpose in
writing the story. With this state
ment, of my motive and attitude
before you I will now answer the
specific charges in order.
It is said that "no specific charges
are made" which gives most peo
ple a feeling "of contempt for the
man who makes his attacks in the
dark." My purpose was not to
make specific charges nor attacks
but to outline methods and state
facts If I had taken real charac
ters, given them real names, and
charged them with any evil, 1
would have wronged them. I have
not attacked men but actions, not
organizations but methods.
It is objected that "it is intimated

in these articles lliut the leaders in
Christian Endeavor work, both in
the chapel and in Palo Alto, are in
religion for political purposes." 1
intimated that two or three men
had attempted to get "in religion
for political purposes." This is
founded on history, not imagina
tion.
'"It may well he asked why the
word 'ring 1 is made so much of in
these articles." The word "ring"
occurs once in the entire story
of thirteen thousand words. There,
on page two of number four, the
context explains sufficiently what
I mean by a ''ring." There is
no occasion for the successful can
didates for office this year go

ing before the president of the
University or any faculty com
mittee and telling all they know
about student body politics and
methods. Dr. Jordan has said that
the politics of the University are
in the hands of the students. I
have not hesitated to come before
the student body and say much
that I know about student body poli
tics and methods.
In my articles I acknowledge
that I have made mistakes in the
treatment of characters which may
have worked injustice on certain
men, but it can not, I think,be justly
said that I was partisan in my
attitude. What I have suggested
is true. Dane Coolidge.
