There are a few circumstances
connected with the lust election in
our student body that seem to de
mand some inquiry into the con
duct of the election and at least a
recount of the ballots cast. With
only 1028 students registered for
the present semester, 90(3 votes
were recorded as cast at one of the
quietest elections in the last four
years, and as against 706 at the
spirited contest for treasurer last
year.
Besides, at least twenty-seven
votes were found togethei near the
bottom of the ballot box, all voting
for the same limited number of
candidates. The narrow margin
of six votes by which the treasurer
ship was won when the great op
portunity for mistakes because of
the numerous inexperienced clerks
is considered, would at least seem
to call fora recount.
Some of the Executive Commit
tee made an attempt to get this re
count and to place the polling list
before the student body to see if
any one is marked there as voted
who did not vote. When the fact
is well known that one factor in
student body politics had almost
complete control of the voting and
when the opportunities for mis
takes are so evident, is it unfair at
least to ask for an explanation
from our Executive Committee of
the various seemingly inexplicable
things involved? Student.
