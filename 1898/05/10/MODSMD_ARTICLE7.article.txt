Before the close of the semester
we desire to acknowledge publicly
the faithfulness with which the
Daily I'alo Alto staff lias sup
ported the editor-in-chief. With
few exceptions the staff has worked
harder and more earnestly than
any with which it has been the ed
itor's lot tn work ; and if the paper
has achieved any degree of success
this semester, the credit should he
given to the entire hoard of editors.
The responsibility for its short
comings rests with the editor him
self.
