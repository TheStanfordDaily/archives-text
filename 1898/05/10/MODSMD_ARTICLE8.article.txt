We would like to believe the re
assuring views Mr. Schwartz ex
pressed in his contribution yester
day; we would like to believe that
there is nothing corrupt in political
methods at Stanford; but how he
reaches such conclusions in view of
this year's experiences is quite be
yond comprehension. It is well to
be optimistic, but his sentiments
tend rather to lull the student body
to a false sense of security than to
create a sense of alertness which
would render futile any attempts
at dishonest political methods.
" The Holy Man in Politics" was
not written by a blindfolded man
without a knowledge of facts, de
siring to stab to heart the honor of
his University. Descending to
personalities does not strengthen a
case or prove a point in a discus
sion abounding in abstractions.
When students and alumni are
disgusted with the slate of politics
at Stanford it iB false patriotism
and false pride which ignores the
facts. An abstract discussion can
not prove a point, and a descent to
specific facts and instances would
only be more odious. The editor
of the Sequoia did right to adapt
imaginary characters to existing
conditions. If any one is hurt by
the story, it must be because the
shoe fits.
