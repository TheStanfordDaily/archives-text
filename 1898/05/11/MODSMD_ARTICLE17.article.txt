A systematic attempt should be
made next year to build up Encina
Hall. With the new restaurant in
operation there is no reason why

able to live on the campus. The
new club-room will be made as at
tractive as possible and will afford
many conveniences not to be ob
tained elsewhere. The best in

perpetuation of the Stanford spirit
demand that Encina llall should
be tilled with students next year.
