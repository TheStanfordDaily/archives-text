# TRACK CAPTAIN ELECTED.
## Everett W. Smith, '99, Chosen to Lead the Athletes of the University Next Year. 
### 
The '98 track team had its an-
J nual picture taken this afternoon
iat Thors'. After the picture was
taken the track captain for 1899
was elected. E. W. Smith, '99,
was chosen by a unanimous vote.
Smith is a good example of what
hard, conscientious work will do
fora man on the track. In his
freshman year he was a point win
ner in the mile and by hard work
he has improved so that now he
stands at the head of the distance
men in either Berkeley or Stanford.
In this year's intercollegiate
Smith won the mile in record time
and in the hai f defeated Carroll,
Berkeley's idol.
Smith entered Stanford with the
Class of '99, from Dorchester, Mass.
He is a member of Euphronia
and an associate editor on the
Daily Palo Alto.
