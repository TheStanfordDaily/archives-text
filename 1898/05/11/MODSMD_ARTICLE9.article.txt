### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto. â€”The
Executive Committee does not feel
called upon to pay any attention
in its official capacity to anony
mous questions or irresponsible
charges. It simply desires to state
to the students that the official
records of the recent election are in
the hands of the secretary of the
Associated Students, and have been
ever since the election open to the
inspection of any student. No at
tempt has been made by any mem
ber of the Executive Committee to
get a recount of the votes cast last
Wednesday and no demand fora
recount has ever been brought be
fore the committee. C. E. Haas,
Secy. Associated Students.
