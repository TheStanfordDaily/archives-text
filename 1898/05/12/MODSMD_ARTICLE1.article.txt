### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto. —We,
the undersigned members of the
Executive Committee of the Asso
ciated Students, have indepen
dently investigated the recent
election, held for the election of
student body officers, as thoroughly
as time would permit. By this in
vestigation we found that the fol
lowing names are cancelled as
having voted, who are not nor
have been registered in the Univer
sity this semester, as certified to
by Dr. Elliott below:
Biackstone, H. W.
Brasch, F. E.
Briggs, N L.
Burrel, Miss V. J.
Elliott, M.
Gussefeld, Clara
Gwartney, J. G.
Hawley, Miss H.
McCroskey, B. B.

Maxwell, \V. C.
O'Hara, T. J.

Sayeki, Hanshiro
Schaaf, Miss M. E.
Snow, Edith H.

mester, 1897-98. O. L. Elliott.]
in the short time available we
have not been able to ascertain
definitely the number of registered
students who did not vote though
marked as voted. We have found
three young ladies, however, whose
names are marked as voted who
did not vote, as may be seen from
the following signed statement:
"We, the undersigned, did not
vote in the recent student body
election. Vera Town send,
Edith Ducker,
Bertha A. Wiltz."
There were 895 ballots counted
for treasurer, ibis being the highest
number voting for any one office.
The poll-book of the election shows
902 ballots cast. From this"it is
plain that seven ballots were not
voted for treasurer. It is positively
known that 25 of the names
marked on the Register did not
vote. There is thus a possible 18
illegal ballots known to have been
cast, and in the light of the hur
ried investigation it is altogether
likely there were more.
During the count of the ballots
there was general surprise expressed
that at the bottom of the box were
thirty ballots in a bunch marked
in the same way and voted for the
same candidates.
In the light of the above facts
and in response to the article in last
night's issue of t he Palo Alto signed
by Secretary Haas, we demand an in
vestigation of this clear attempt
to fraudulently carry the election.
