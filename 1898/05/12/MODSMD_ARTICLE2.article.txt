# Communication.

Jt now appears that the anony-

mouß communication from"A Stu
dent" was based on reliable infor
mation.
At any rate, such damaging accu
sations should be thoroughly in
vestigated out of justice to ' the
candidates and for the good of the
student body. The part of the Ex
ecutive Committee which decided
to overlook the communication
should have attempted to sift the
matter down and either expose
crookedness or vindicate those who
had charge of the balloting as
justice demanded.
The president of the student
body is expected to prevent the
possibility of cheating and guar
antee fairness to the candidates,
and it is the duty of the Executive
Committee to assist him. In this
particular election it would have
become the president, being a can
didate himself, to have taken extra
precautions that all was above
suspicion, and have prevented the
confusion that existed at the count
ing of the ballots.
So many of the important offices
had only one candidate that less
thau usual interest attended this
electnm; consequently the alertness
of rival candidate?- was in part ab
sent. It may be questioned why
are there not more candidates. It
is not because the students fear
wholesome competition but be
cause they fear unwholesome com
petition. There are two classes of
oflice seekers in the University.
There are those who are interested
in a certain kind of work or sport
and who achieve honor of the sort
bestowed by the office. Another
class a e those who are studying to
be politicians and who use and
manipulate student offices for prac
tice. Of course practice will make
shrewd men of some of the latter,
but it is a little rough on the af
fairs practiced upon.
Those who intend to be politi
cians begin to lay their wires the
moment they enter the University
and let no opportunity slip for
making alliances and getting
"pulls." They organize, allot offi
ces, and if some student outside
their circle seems to be the promis
ing candidate for some position
they have one or more "friends"
approach him and try to discour
age him or they promise him some
other office if he will draw out, or
ask him to join an organization.
Organized politics causes scar
city of candidates and makes stuff
ing of the ballott box a possibility.
