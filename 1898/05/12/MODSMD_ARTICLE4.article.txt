Editor Daily Palo Alto. — It
lias been a great surprise to me to
find that s> many people voted in
the recent election that did not
vote. I consider that no one has

an immediate investigation, and in
case of another election, I protest
against the polls and count being
left in the hands of people, the
majority of whom are friends of a
particular candidate or set of can
did;! tes. It has been denied that
there in a "ring" in this University,

sure that in the past there have
been "strikers" who have affiliated
for reasons other than those of
friendship. F. S. Howard.
