The lecture last Tuesday evening
by Professor Goebel on "German
Folk Songs" was thoroughly en
joyed by a large number of stu
dents and their friends. The lec
turer gave a sketch of the rise of
the folk song and its relation to
the life ot the people. His illus
trations were confined mainly to
the songs now sung in a certain
community on the Rhine near
Mainz. Several of these were read
in the original, others in English,
the translating having been done
on our own campus by Mr. Yost.
A number of songs were charm
ingly rendered by a double quartet
of students, Dr. Goebel accompany
ing. Said the lecturer in closing,
"If some of the greatest minds in
Germany have found new life and
strength in these songs, then surely
we cannot afford to overlook them.
The ideal goods which we possess
are the lasting ones. For us who
live in abstract thought it is neces
sary to come near to life, and one
ery delightful way lies through
these songs of the people."
