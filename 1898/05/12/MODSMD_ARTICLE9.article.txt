# The
						Course in Wood-Working.
## 
### 
One of the least known courses
in the University is one in which
Senator Stanford took especial in
terest. It is the course in Wood
working designed to bear the same
relation to Engineering that pub
lic schools hold to colleges. It was
felt to be a need because there is so
little opportunity elsewhere for
preparation that includes elemen
tary bench and lathe work.
Senator Stanford established this
department at the opening of the
University and placed in charge of
it Mr. Edward Soule, who has had
extended experience in this line of
work. Fifty students, including
several women, have taken the

work this year. Economics, Bio
nomics, Physiology, Law, and His
tory are the major subjects of some
of the students in this course.
Some neat work in California woods
was done during the year. Thejcourse
affords an opportunity for valuable
manual training. The shop is
open to students from 10 to 12:30
and from '2 to 5.
The course in Forging, which
bears the same relation to the ad
vanced courses as that of Wood
Working, has an enrollment this
year of twenty-five students.
