'I'lii' Equitable Society has a SURPLUS of $50,543,175, and is the strongest life
assurance company in the world. tins is a point of the first importance, since
life assurance contracts may not mature for mauy years after they have been
entered into by the contracting parties
The advantage enjoyed by the Equitable Society in consequence of its large
surplus ami superior tlnaneiai strength deserves, at this time, special attention
for another reason: the Society now "offers to the assuring public a new form of
policy, whose most st.rtki.ng characteristic is that a great number of exceed
i'i 1\ valuab e and detlnite (iIJA K A NTEKS tire embodied iti the contract. Any
guarantee made by a company with a surplus exceeding FIFTY MILLION
DOLLARS is obviously worth more tH >ii would tie the promise of a company of
limited resources, or of one whose management had been such as to impair its
tlnaneiai strength.
