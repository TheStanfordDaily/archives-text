# "THE OLD AND THE NEW."
## Commencement Address by Professor Walter Miller. 
### 
"The old order changeth, yielding place
to new,
And God fulfills Himself in many ways,
Lest one good custom should corrupt t he
world."
The land in which we live is
called "the New World," and our
individual lot is cast in the newest
part of it. The problems, educa
tional as well as political, which
our country has had to face are,
many of them, new. We have
grown up, as far as we have grown
at all, under the stimulus of condi
tions all our own. We have been
bound by no distant past nor
necessarily hampered by the tradi
tions of the lands from which our
fathers came. Most of our short
national life has so far been an
experiment. What the experiment
will prove will he known when our
young western world has grown to
age. In the meantime all the
civilized world is watching with
eager eyes each new stage of our
experimenting. In our present
state we are generally accused of
being a nation of mediocrity, except
in bulk. One century has seen us
suddenly transformed from three
million subject colonists on the
Atlantic sea-board into a nation of
sixty million sovereign citizens
whose dominions reach from ocean
to ocean. Similarly our culture is
full grown hut immature, like a
boy of sixteen six feet tall. The
like of our system (or want of sys
tem) of education was never seen
nor ever dreamed of before. Our
grammar school may find its
counterpart in the old world; but
our American high school is
neither the English grammar
school nor the German gymnasium
nor the French Lycee. Our Amer
ican college may he the outgrowth
of the Oxford and Cambridge idea
further developed, but the Amer
ican university is not the Englisl
university nor the German univer
sity. It is a mixed product grown
up under new conditions on new
soil.
Europe makes merry over our
481 colleges and universities and
wonders how they all manage to
exist. Never mind Europe; we do
the same ourselves. Hut our col
leges which we count by hundreds
are a necessary link in the evolu
tion of a coming educational system
worthy of our western civilization;
for as they are, they represent and
foster the spirit of our national
life. Every nation must in her
own way show that she has abiding
in her the love of truth; and that
love can best be cherished only in
ways that conform to her own
character and promise the fulfill
ment of her own purposes. In the
development to which we look for
ward, who can say that we have
too many colleges now? They will
rather be found too few. There is
scarcely a community in the length
and breadth of our land that would
not gladly make large sacrifices to
secure in its midst the location of a
promising college and so increase
the present list. When the ideal
of the American university is real
ized and the college of to-day falls
into its natural place as a school of

culture and of preparation for the
higher university of tomorrow, we
shall find that we have after all
too few rather than too many col
leges. Such a result Would be hut
another of history's repetitions.
For the first twelve years of higher
education in Michigan, when uni
versities did not mean much more
in the way of education than high
schools do now, that commonwealth
had no less than nine state colleges.
They all struggled along at starva
tion rates. Hut they were far from
being a menace to society or a
danger to education. For as one
of the nine grew into a university,
the other eight, as was right and
best, fell into their natural place as
preparatory schools of a high order
feeders for the one real univer
sity. And today we regret only
that there had not been more of
those "starveling" colleges to follow
the same course. Now that ideals
have grown upward and expanded,
the same development may take
place to our well-being on the pres
ent higher plane. Our college cur-

riculum lias undergone wondrous
changes in the last '200 years; the
garment that was placed upon the
American college in its infancy has
heen long since outgrown, and the
patterns after which it was cut are
no longer in fashion. The oldest
of our colleges is, in comparison
with Paris and Oxford, as far as
years are concerned, still in its
childhood. And who knows hut
the spirit that planted these 4<Sl
colleges will yet realize its fulfill
ment in the "true idea of a univer
sity''? What will that consumma
tion be?
Our present system (if what we
have may fairly he called a system)
is a development, with the various
additions and other changes that
come with growth, out of the edu
cation of past ages. In order to
determine what the next stage in
its growth will he we must examine
the history of its growth through
the past and the conditions and
tendencies of its present stage.
Our whole modern civilization in
its existent forms, this age of steel
and steam and electricity, with all
its triumphs of applied science in

the creation of great labor-saving
machinery, in rapid transit and the
annihilation of distance and time,
is a wondrous growth, exceeding in
this one century in these particu
lars the sum total of all that pre
vious history has recorded. Hut
follow this marvelous shoot down
ward to the stem and we shall find
that it is after all a graft. "The
same," to use Professor William
Smith's figure, "The same was en
grafted upon the sturdy stem of the
olden culture, a stem that struck
its roots deep into the sacred soil
of Greece and Home, through the
rich accumulated alluvium of
nearly thirty centuries. Into this
graft, this new scion, the generous
sap of the ancient trunk has been
poured abundantly and a pro
digious growth and wonderful
fruitage have resulted."
The art of Greece has been the
inspiration, the wonder, and the
despair of all artists since the day
when the lofty spirit of Hellenic
greatness began to Hag. The
mythology of Greece lias become

the language of symbol among all
civilized peoples of whatever name
and tongue. The poetry, the phil
osophy, the ethics, and the science
as well as the arts of Greece,
illumine every modern classic
page. Says Alfred Baker, professor
of mathematics in Toronto: "If
we should ever think of a people —
a chosen people —who had a mes
sage and a revelation to the world,
that people was the ancient Greeks.
We owe them an incalculable debt
for our knowledge of art, literature,
and science, and of the three our
debt is perhaps greatest for their
legacy of science." Whether con
sciously or unconsciously, we build
upon foundations laid, or at least
after plans drawn, by the great
thinkers —poets, artists, philoso
phers, scientists —of the days when
man was, in both body and intel
lect, at bis best. Even this present
age of scientific education is but
continuing the work where Greece
left off, and without the pioneering
work done by the science of those
old days and without the literature
of Greece upon whose light some men
of science now see tit to turn their

backs, our own science would have
bmt forced to go back to the most
primitive conceptions of nature and
waste centuries in traveling the
roads which the classical thinkers
built through unbroken wilds and
trod for us. Others have labored
and we have entered into their
labors.
If, then, the impression left by
the Hellenic spirit upon our world
of art and letters has l>een so strong
and so abiding, what of our inher
itance of educational ideals from
the same source? And if the
disciple has not been greater than
the master in those expressions of
creative genius, has the master
been surpassed in the business of
educating men and training the
powers in them for the creation of
great ideas and great ideals?
Though ignorance may some
times sneer and "self-complacent
modernism" sometimes assail, yet
one need not be a mere praiser of
the times that are gone to assert
that that age saw, in at least some
strata of society, man at his high
est and best since his creation, both
mentally and physically. "The
theories of the seers stood the test
of application by the men of
deeds." (Butler.) And so it is
our right, and our duty as well to
ask how that condition was real
ized, and why we, with the example
of their successes and their failures
and with the addition of the spirit
that was introduced by way of
Bethlehem and Calvary, can not
attain to that and better than that
by the addition of the moral and
spiritual strength that is ours from
on high.
The problems that the young
Athenians of brains and power had
to face were not so very different
from those which confront the
young American. Their polity
was, as ours is called, a democracy
—a government of the people by
the people. Their youth must,
therefore, be fitted (and so must
ours) not only for good citizenship,
but for the highest duties of citi
zens who are also rulers. Was
their course of training for it dif
ferent from ours? Have we learned
from it all that we can apply with
advantage to our own conditions?
The feature of Athenian educa
tion that has been most overlooked
in the modern was the love of the
beautiful. This was the dominat
ing principle in education, and we
would do well not to leave the
Aesthetic sense longer in neglect.
Hellenic sanity —soundness of body
and of intellect and of all that is
produced by either —is proverbial.
And through it all must run the
golden thread of beauty. As they
developed their language to its
peerless beauty and expressiveness,
as Callicrates and Ictinus reared
their wondrous temples, as Phidias
and Praxiteles carved their statues
and Polygnotus and Apelles spread
their canvases with perfect beauty
and symmetry, so they trained the
intellect and the soul into beauty
and strength, and so they trained
the body with a view to the beauti
ful and strong; and everything
that could tend in the opposite
direction was strictly proscribed.
In general, our universities, high
schools or gymnasia, and common


PROFESSOR WALTER MILLER
schools have their prototypes in
the similar institutions of classical
Athens. The fundamental prin
ciples even of the kindergarten we
find clearly set forth in the Repub
lic of Plato and embodied in his
infant-school.
The aim of the public school was
to awaken the minds of the youth
and help them to find the place in
the world that each could fill
better than any other, and above
all to furnish that sesthetic culture
which all ages have considered
important and which some still
reckon the paramount object of
our higher education.
The theory that education, as
distinguished from special train
ing, should afford a broad general
culture and that this is best secured
by a study of "humanity," or the
"humanities," is older than Soc
rates, new as to-day. That it has
been a suitable foundation upon
which to build our own educational
systems is not too much to assert;
for it is safe to say that through
that method of education, rather
than in spite of it, men were pro
duced who were in real training of
mind, in mastery of principles and
knowledge of men, in capacity for
every form of mental effort, from
the most refined speculation to the
conduct of every day affairs of
state and of business, the most
perfectly educated people the world
has ever seen.
That sort of training aimed at
producing not professional athletes,
nor musicians, nor mathemati
cians, but men, men of thought and
of action, who should be capable
of taking front rank in whatever
special lines of activity their after
life might lead. Competition then
was no less keen than it is now;
only that man received first honors
then and eternal fame to come,
who in his day could do some one
thing better than any other man
in Athens. Xenophon,in his Edu
cation of Cyrus, brings out the
necessity they felt for trained
specialists when he says that "those
w r ho give up paying attention to
many things and devote themselves
to some one thing, they are sure to
be the best in their particular
line." But such specialization, as
his words clearly imply, was re
served until after breadth of culture
was secured.
After a preparation of this kind,
the young man might devote him
self with perfect freedom of choice
all but exclusively to some one de
partment of knowledge. To afford
this special training was the busi
ness of the university. For from
the day of Gorgias, Socrates, Plato,
Athens had taken her place as the
university city of the world; and
she maintained it (even against the
glitter of the Ptolemaic state uni
versity at Alexandria) until nar
row-minded despotism closed her
doors and smothered the fires of
knowledge, which could not die but
smouldered on beneath the ashes,
to be fanned again into living
flame with the revival of learning
in the sixteenth century. That
university had its departments of
art, science, economics, philosophy,
letters, and each great teacher was
a special department unto himself;
it was, thus constituted, a univer
sity in the truest sense of the word,
although not organized with a
board of trustees and a cast-iron
charter, a university built not of
bricks but of brains, not with
mortar but with men; and it
exerted an influence that not only
filled the world then, but has made
itself felt even until now and will
continue to be a power as long as
there are students to study.

From even this cursory sketch it
may be seen from what beginnings
all our modern systems of education
have grown. For the Greeks have
been the school-masters of the
nations ;is today is the school
master of tomorrow. When Rome
made the soil of Hellas a Roman
province but bowed in humble
submission before the power of her
captive's intellect and fell herself a
captive to Grecian arts and letters,
the Athenian education was bodily
transplanted to Italian soil. As
ime progressed, the martial vigor
of Rome became a part of the bone
and tissue of the imported culture
of the lower schools; but the uni
versity was still at Athens, though
rivalled for a time by Alexandria
and Rhodes.
Rome spread her power and her
language over all western Europe,
and the official Latin tongue be
came the first and the chief subject
of study in the schools as the only
means of social and political and
afterwards ecclesiastical advance
ment. On one ground or another,
if for nothing more than mere tra
dition, it has maintained ils place
as the first and most essential
element in educational systems
that still exist as models of all that
should be.
Barbarism and Christianity
joined hands to crush the old uni
versity centres and blot out Grecian
culture from the world. Their
success, while not absolute, was
only too complete. The extin
guishing of the light of letters left
the world in darkness and gloom
for centuries with only here and
there a flickering rush light of
logical, mystical, or ecclesiastical
subtleties. Such profound ques
tions as how many spirits could
stand together upon the point of a
cambric needle, or whether a spirit
could pass from one point to an
other without passing through the
intervening space, however absurd
and valueless they may appear,
nevertheless did serve to sharpen
men's wits and to make them
hunger and thirst after real ideas.
Whence should spring the fountain
for satisfying such thirst? Had
all possibility of real ideas van
ished from the earth? There had
been creators of ideals once; had
their products all vanished with
the departure of their culture and
their power? Through the dark
ages the capacity for ideas seems to
have died out in men. For the
world was asleep —asleep for a
thousand years of rest and re-crea
tion. In the twelfth century it
began to awake, and with the
Italian Renaissance the dead ca
pacity for ideas was reborn.
"There were many forces," says
Professor Shoup, "that worked to
gether to produce the Renaissance,
but in Italy, at least, the main
cause was the recovery and study
of the Greek and Latin classics,
aided by the ever-present object
lessons of the grandeur of Roman
architecture and the loveliness of
Greek sculpture."
Thus with the rebirth of the
Athenian spirit among men came
also the resurrection of the univer
sity idea. The mediaeval universi
ties had hitherto provided for law,
theology, and medicine. The new
movement, which saved the arts
and sciences of Greece and Rome,
now brought in the''humanities"
as the education of culture —the
philosophical faculty—and the way
was opened wide 'or the easy de
velopment of the modern univer
sity. "The culture of the classics
bad to be re-appropriated before
the movement of the modern mind
could begin." (Symonds.) It was

through them that came again the
spiritual freedom, the intellectual
culture, the powers of criticism,
of comparison, and of scientific re
search that make an ideal educa
tion possible in our own day. And
with all the advances of the "new
education" the humanities are still
the humanities, enriched by many
a wholesome increment. Amid all
the other agencies for culture they
still form the essential element to
that aesthetic culture which all
consider important and which some
consider paramount, though we all
recognize that the world has many
things to learn besides Greek and
Latin.
Out of this new shoot springing
up from the old olive stump of
intellectual Attica have branched
forth the various scions which are
our modern universities. The evo
lution of the university has been,
like evolution in the natural world,
a spiral now rising, again descend
ing upon itself, but gaining with
each new circle. And as in the
organic world old forms die and
new ones come in, not created out
of nothing, but simply transforma
tions of the old: so our modern
higher education is but the old
university ideal transformed or
transforming, but not yet glorified.
Nothing really new has been added
to the sap in the veins of the tree
of knowledge, for all the grafts
that hive been set upon it. The
kindergarten, the grammar school,
the college and the university, with
its science and letters, its co
education, its elective system and
its majors and minors—but no de
grees —are as old as Plato. Indeed,
so little has the university ideal
grown since the unrivalled intel
lectual genius of Athens at the
climax of her intellectual power
evolved it, that it may be (and
since this paragraph was penned,
has been) seriously questioned
whether there is any such thing as
the "new education." "There is
nothing new under the sun" is no
where more true or false than in
the intellectual world. Sir Henry
, Maine goes so far as to say that
"Except the blind forces of Nature,
nothing moves in this world which
is not Greek in its origin." There
have been many revivals of knowl
edge besides the Italian Renais
sance; within a few years zoology,
chemistry, and geology have all
been born again. How hard we
toil to advance knowledge by in
troducing some "new" institution,
discovering some new truth. Hut
truth is eternal; and when our dis
covery is made we find the real
meaning of the poet's words:
"Wer kan 11 was (Dummes, wer was)
Kluges denken
Das nicht die Vorweltschon gedacht?"
Through all the growth and de
velopment of both the old and the
new the purpose of the university
has been always the same: not for
learning things, but for learning
how to learn things; not for cram
ming the memory with facts and
dates, but for teaching how to ob
serve facts and to cultivate a sense
of their relativity and the spirit of
criticism; not merely for enriching
the understanding, but for the
creation of a new life, the awaken
ing of a higher, nobler, truly scien
tific spirit, the culture and develop
ment of the thinking mind.
Education is the leading of the
young up into the intellectual and
spiritual kingdom that is theirs by
right of inheritance.
Sometimes it has been forgotten
that this can not be gained through
force or by following mechanical
forms and rules; nor can it be
secured in any other atmosphere

than one of freedom, with all of its
privileges and all of its responsi
bilities. The ''winds of freedom"
also were let loose from the yEolian
cave, and only too often have they
been lashed and locked in again.
Now perfect intellectual freedom
is ours once more. The attainment
of the true ideal of education,
from the kindergarten to the acad
emy of scholars, is almost within
our grasp. Shall we in our day
realize the ideal? If so, there are
a few faults in our American edu
cation which must he eradicated,
and the whole system must he
brought into line with the general
upward trend.
In the first place, in order to
make the true ideal of American
education a reality and to secure
breadth of culture combined with
power in some special field, tlie
work of the lower schools must be
made more thorough and more
effective. Those of our secondary
schools whose avowed purpose is to
fit its pupils for college, and that,
too, for some particular college, are
by far the most satisfactory in their
results. But in general our chil
dren come out of the common
school with little interest in the
higher life, iittle feeling and less
power of expressing the feeling
they have. They have no more
yearning after culture and sym
metrical training and healthy
growth than has the rose-bush in
the garden. The same reform that
will put a new spirit into our sec
ondary schools to render them
more effective will necessarily bring
with it a more desirable saving of
time for securing in college the
breadth of culture needed for the
most effective specializing in some
one fieid of knowledge afterward.
Then, in the second place, we
need some real system of organic
connection between our various
schools. There should be no leaps
in the mental development any
more than there are in natural
growth; as it is, however, our pupils
must successfully make several
before they reach the blissful goal
of an academic degree. The sec
ondary school has no rational
connection with the primary de
partment on the one hand; and on
the other, while it does not pretend
itself to be the apex of any educa
tional system, it still has as an
institution no vital connection with
the higher seminaries of learning.
It has begun, to the no small detri
ment of the youth, to ape univer
stiv methods —encouragingchildren
in knickerbockers and short skirts
to pursue all their knowledge, sci
entific, literary, and historical, back
to its ultimate sources! And that,
before they, or even nine-tenths of
their teachers, know what an ulti
mate source is, or how to judge one
critically if they should happen to
stumble upon it! Nothing could
be further from the real purpose of
the high school than the production
of scholarship.
And as the secondary education
has not yet settled down into its
own proper sphere, so the university
has not been able to draw its own
differentiating line just where it
ought to be, and seems compelled
to teach high school subjects in
high school ways. There is as
little propriety in the university's
whipping bad English into shape
and drilling on the elements of
Latin or French or German as
there is in the high school's at
tempting to teach Roman history
from ''the sources."
When lines are properly drawn
and the desired organic connection
made, we may see a straight and
steady growth from infancy to
scholarship with an appreciable
saving of precious years now
wasted through lack of definite
purpose. Our secondary schools
will he an immediate continuation
of the primary; the high schuol
and the college will cease to overlap
each other; and the college or uni
versity will in its turn be a contin
uation of the high schuol as the
high school of the grammar school,
but necessarily something more;
not even this institution, however,
may be regarded as a factory for
turning out scholars; the under
graduate college will be a place
where, with the help of great
teachers, great libraries and lab
oratories, any student may find the
training that will give him culture
and strength. In the case of those
who have not already set their in
tellectual ambitions upon some
definite line of life work the culture
must be particularly broad that it
may find their peculiar talents out
and awaken their love for that
work which they are best adapted
to do. The university, as it is, is
not for the purpose of making
scholars, but for developing the
men and women out of whom
scholars, investigators, teachers,
statesmen, may be made. It is not
necessary, nor even desirable, that
all our masses should be scholars;
the best "out-living" is not likely
to be given by one whose time is
wholly spent over ancient manu
scripts or over a microscope. To
live a life of righteousness, to do no
wrong to any man, to master one's
own self, to serve God and one's
fellow-men —all that needs no
scholarly erudition. But no one's
culture — the upbuilding and
strengthening of all that is good in
him, wide range of intellect and
knowledge—can be too deep or too
broad. That may be called the
fundamental idea of our American
colleges and universities, and here
in may be found the highest boast
of our education, as it has been:
that without definite regard for a
learned profession, it affords the
possibility of an all-round train
ing, a broadening and elevating
culture for the common man,
widening his horizon and enabling
him to see truth and live truth.
Hut even with this it is evident
that our system is not, and never
has been, complete. We feel that
most when we follow up the differ
ent stages of the instructing body
as we have outlined the different
degrees of schools. Our teaching
can nowhere be better than the
teachers. Where are these trained?
Whence comes the great army of
teachers for our primary schools?
In general, from the secondary
schools. Whence the teachers of
the secondary schools? Nearly all
of them from the colleges and uni
versities. And where are the
teachers in the colleges and uni
versities trained? With few ex
ceptions, like most of our children's
doll's and hobby-horses, and for the
same reason, they bear the familiar
stamp, "Made in Germany." The
explanation is in either case the
same: Germany has the appli
ances for their production. Our
own want in this particular has
been felt ever since' the days of
Washington. The graduate de
partments appended to almost
every ambitious university in the
land are incontrovertible testimony
to the fact that in America we do
need and do want universities like
or superior to the German uni
versities. Academies of science, in
a feeble way, we already have.
The whole lower school is a great
mental gymnasium; everything is
aimed at training, developing; be

tween the master and the pupil
there is intellectually a great gulf;
for every exercise the master puts
the pupil through is to tne latter
dillicult, but to the former simple.
In the university this distance be
tween teacher and taught is less
ened. The student comes with
powers trained and his capacity
approximates more nearly that of
the instructor, while the latter is
for the same reason ready to meet
him more than half way. While
our college professors are perform
ing the double functions of in
vestigators and teachers they are
indeed doing their most teliing
personal work, the work that will
impress their personality most
imperishably upon the after world
and make themselves immortal;
but if their first and highest aim is
the advancement of their particular
science through their own personal
investigation, then every hour of
elementary instruction is a brake
upon the wheels of their power,
every hour's lecture that is made
to tit the needs of learners repre
sents so much time and energy
diverted from their proper channel.
We often hear of young men in
search of college positions who are
•'brilliant scholars," but dismal
failures as teachers. Their place
is not in the instructor's chair,
where their efforts at teaching will
be, both to themselves and to the
students, worse than wasted. If
they are investigators, our country
sh uld have a place for them, with
libraries, laboratories, and observa
tories, as well as for the teachers
who are scholars only less devoted
to the prosecution of research be
cause they have the spirit of teach
ing. The real investigator's best
will be attained only by giving
himself up absolutely to learning,
to pushing forward the outposts
of investigation and widening the
circuit of thought and knowledge
and never relaxing from the exer
tion of his highest power. These
are the men who can afford to
specialize in one small field of
science to the exclusion of every
thing else that is of interest to
humanity. Their work also is
essential to the advancement of the
race and to the growth of educa
tion; and the perfect educational
system must have a place for them
and for their work. One such
university our country already has
and will soon, we trust, have an
other —the National University—
to foster investigation and train
scholars, and so raise up the whole
standard of our national educa
tion. Thus, through the common
feature of instruction, the college
has its organic connection with the
high school; while it joins hands
with the higher universities through
the seminaries and laboratories
where the scholar that is to be is
trained in methods of independent
research and discovery of truth.
And when this idea 1 is consum
mated in our land; when those of
the colleges that can do so become
universities and those that can not
become universities fall naturally
into their places as training schools
for the real universities; then we
shall have a genuine system of edu
cation,and the National University
or Academy will be the pinnacle of
that system, rising as high above
our colleges as they above the
common schools.
The last defect to mention is the
most serious and will lie the most
difficult to correct, for it is the
most insidious and the most deeply
rooted. The curse of our edu a
tional spirit is "the tendency to look
upon education as a mere tool for
money-getting." Those who look

upon know ledge only from the stand
point of "practical" utility are likely
to seein the university only a bureau
for the delivery of special informa
tion, a mere warehouse for literary,
medical, or legal merchandise, in
stead of a temple of knowledge
and truth. The enrichment of
knowledge and power is not con
sidered and therefore not desired.
Too general is the conception in
our land that nothing is practical,
nothing is useful, even in matters
of pure intellect, unless it can be
translated into dollars and cents.
Art' we, brain and brawn, so wholly
enslaved to Mammon? Nay, can
it be denied that the same master
is enslaving, or has already en
slaved, even the intellectual pro
fessions —the bar, the bench, the
clinic, the chair, the studio, and
even the pulpit ? "Even where
science, art, and literature, the
things of the mind, are pursued
after a fashion, it is too often not
as an end, but as a means, not for
love, but to get rich or at least to
make a living." And for that very
reason it is usually "only after a
fashion' 1 that they are pursued.
To him who studies literature,
philosophy, or mathematics only as
a means to such an end, even
these pursuits of pure intellect are
as much a "bread and butter edu
cation" as law or medicine to him
who has no higher interest in his
science than financial advantage
to himself.
It is a matter for regret that
higher education has not more
frequently as its object disinterested
culture —the enriching and beauti
fying of the soul —but only the
practical, financial advantage of
the student. How few study Greek
and Latin and higher mathematics
any more just for the sake of know
ing them or as a means of calling
forth power, of cultivating taste
and character, right ambition, and
interest in great and high themes!
Is not the incentive to such studies
in these days rather a desire to
pass the examinations and get into
college, or, sometimes, to make a
living by teaching them, which is,
after all, only another way of
serving a selfish purpose? If they
could not be turned to immediate,
practical advantage, they would be
studied much less than they are.
In precisely the same way, most
students study physics or chemistry
not for the philosophic delight of
finding out the secrets of nature,
but solely to find through them a
means of livelihood, and, haply,
a certain advantage in the struggle
for wealth.
With all these faults and virtues
in view 1 come today to plead not
alone for the old education of
proper morals, polished manners,
elegant speech, nor yet for the new
education of exclusive science, but
for a proper balance between the
old and the new —the culture of
the humanities and of nature as a
basis for later specialization; and
for the concentration of all one's
ability afterward on some one por
tion of the vast lield of science and
knowledge. The principle upon
which the whole plea is based is
that true education must, have
three dimensions, length, breadth
and depth. Of these breadth must
be provided for in the undergradu
ate college course; the opportunity
will never come again, and can
never come again. Depth can
be added only in the special
training of the graduate university
and after study. Length is a rel
ative dimension depending upon
the length and intensity of life.
Hut all three must begin together.
The danger against which this

warning signal is raised is that
'specialization before breadth is
attained will prove to be not power
and culture, but weakness and nar
rowness. . . . It will be the Same,
whatever the line of premature
specialization. Exclusive devotion
from the beginning to the arts and
letters is ruinous to our best devel
opment, even though that has been
the proved and approved higher
education of the last four hundred
years. . . . And yet by confining
ourselves to such a course we come
to live so much in the realm of the
ideal that we ignore or forget the
real things around us. The great
literatures of the world are not our
only source of truth, nor the only
scene of beauty, nor the only
means of culture. The whole busi
ness of any man is to know and to
live the truth. He must have eyes
that will see truth wherever it may
be fmnd; and there are even
clearer, surer revelations of truth
in (Jod's world around us than in
the world of letters.
We must not fail to recognize
that there are some intellectual
constitutions which utterly refuse
to assimilate culture from scientific
study. So much the worse for
them, in like manner there are
many minds wholly unsusceptible
to the charms of classical poetry.
The more the pity for that. People
thus constituted will have to make
the best they can of a one-sided
culture; if they will only do the
best they can, their culture, for
which the university makes provi
sion, will not have been secured in
vain.
We are all in sympathy with
Professor Virchow'sdefinition: that
the aim of university study is gen
eral scientific and moral culture
together with the mastery of one
special department of study. We
have here at this university a prac
tical plan which has in itself all
the requisite qualities for realizing
the ideal condition of tilings. No
lixed curriculum or system of re
quired studies leading up to a de
gree can furnish to any number of
different minds the culture which
each one needs. Here the student
must have bis own central pur
pose, and it must be an earnest
purpose; toward that, as a central
axis of his life, all other radiating
lines must point. Whether these
radiating lines of light shall be
focused in all their intensity on
one single point, or illumine all
bis path through life and brighten
and help all who cross it there,
depends mainly on the individual
student's aims, but partly also on
him to whom that student looks
for special counsel.
At any rate, narrow specializing
should not begin until the student's
mind is thoroughly disciplined.
Whether that discipline is best
secured in the old-fashioned way
with Latin, Greek, and mathe
matics is a question which has two
good sides for debate. "There is,"
to quote from our President, "much
to be said in favor of the college in
which discipline pure and simple is
made the chief end of all the work.
In such a school those subjects —
languages, sciences, and philosophy
—which serve the ends of training
best, should be taught, and such
subjects only."
When we consider the two great
new principles of our age —the
conservation of energy with all the
wonders it has made possible in
the material world, and biological
evolution with all the marvels it
will produce in not only the phys
ical, but also the intellectual and
| spiritual well-being of the race —
the irresistible attractiveness of the
new education, the triumph of the
scientific education over iill compe
tition, and the preponderating
tendency of students of "practical"
minds to confine themselves to the
scientific education, are easily com
prehended. The educational pen
dulum has been steadily swinging
backward and forward ever since
modern education in the fifteenth
century began, first to one extreme,
and then to the other, as if no
middle ground were possible. Uni
versities were new things when the
Renaissance came. They had
been founded for "practical" pur
poses; and to the devotees of the
"practical" courses the introduction
of the classics was an innovation,
and the new learning was frowned
upon. The humanists of the Refor
mation period had a battle to fight
against tremendous odds. In order
to maintain any place at all, they
had to prove that literature was
delightful for its own sake, and
that Greece and Rome had some
thing worth while to teach to mod
ern men. The struggle was soon
over; the pendulum began to swing
ihe other way; the new learning
triumphed throughout all Europe;
and from the revival of learning
down almost to within the memory
of men still living, any education
without a good strong backbone of
Greek and Latin classics was no
education. Education meant clas
sical education. Hut human nature
rebels against extreme?, and as
surely as extremes prevail, so surely
will come reaction against them.
Thus again after the middle of the
last century, when new life caught
on the souls of men, and lifted
them out of the social and political
corruption of the times, when the
Encyclopedists, as the precursors of
the great Revolution, began the
revolution in the realms of science,
then again came the flight to
antiquity as the only source from
which to gain afresh the elements
of intellectual and artistic life. To
those great crises in civilization, to
those accomplishments of a race
of intellectual giants, humanity
returns again and again as to a
fountain of spiritual youth eternally
fresh and strong.
It is as strange now to reflect
that to the foolish conservatives of
four hundred years ago the classics
were an intolerable innovation, as
it is to think that Huxley and his
compeers had to contend so long
and so hard for the claims of sci
ence to recognition as a force for
culture in a modern education.
And now that the educational
sceptre has passed from classics to
science, and the scientific spirit
dominates every sphere, its more
radical advocates would crowd
entirely out of the field its most
formidable rival, the time-honored
humanistic culture, as having no
place whatever in an up-to-date
education. The pendulum hits
once more swung as far as it can
go. That spirit of science which
is intolerant, whether it is philo
logical science that inveighs against
natural science or natural science
that will allow no place to philo
logical science, is the primal cause
of the violent reactions that come
in the lines of education; that
readiness for revulsion is one of
the things that argue most potently
for the final triumph of breadth.
Intolerance is the child of narrow
ness of spirit; and when we all
dwell together in harmony, each
recognizing the value of all lines
of culture, breadth is assured.
And if Mr. King is right in
his estimate of the purely scientific
mind unbalanced by those mental

pursuits that feed the fancy, en
noble the sentiments, enable us to
enjoy beauty and harmony —and
the ardent advocate of the human
ities is easily persuaded to believe
him —then there is sure to come
against the technical scientific
education so fashionable in our
day a reaction strong enough to
bring about a tremendous revival
of the humanities, in the most
comprehensive sense of the word;
or, if a compromise can be effected,
it may at last stop the swinging
pendulum in'the middle and pro
duce the harmonious blending of
the two cultures that will give us
the full liberal education for which
this plea is made.
With a well-balanced education,
that antiquated narrow contempt
of the new education for the old
will he entirely forgotten. Then
in the eyes of the scientist the
humanist will 110 longer be a man
who can not '"see beyond the horizon
of his own shallow experience, and
who from his self-constructed
throne judges the rest of mankind
with the complacent assurance born
of a fancied superiority." Nor will
the humanist find in this promised
land so many Philistines —"full of
narrowness, full of prejudices, with
a defective type of religion, a nar
row range of intellect and knowl
edge, a stunted sense of beauty, a
low standard of manners, arid
averse, moreover, to whatever may
disturb it in its vulgarity " With
this breadth of intellectual culture,
and the physical culture that our
human nature demands and de
serves, our youth may with joy
enter into their six-fold inher
itance, physical, scientific, literary,
aesthetic, political, and religious,
which is their indisputable birth
right; and thus equipped they may
transmit it preserved and, in some
chosen field, enriched, to genera
tions yet to come. Lame, at least,
is the institution of learning that
withholds from its students any
one of the six.
The world's call is for the man
of learning who knows better than
any one elst how to do some one
thing; but he cannot meet the re
quirements if he knows nothing
but that one thing; he must know
it in its relation to other things; he
must see things in their proper
proportion. "What science and
practical life alike need," says
Professor Butler, "is not narrow
men, but broad men sharpened to a
point."
Let our new education be not a
vertical line, but a pyramid, of
which our present undergraduate
courses shall furnish the base large
and broad and solid; and let the
university of the future, and, until
it is realized, the graduate depart
ments of the present, supply the
apex. It may cost many a reluc
tant sacrifice of intellectual plea
sures as the narrowing process
begins and many more as it con
tinues. It may be painful, but it
is necessary. For in this day of
specialization only the specialist
can work out the best that is in
him and render back to society
what it has done for him. The
first law of the fullest perfection
says: He perfect; that is, cultivate
all your powers completely and
uniformly—as far as possible. And
the second law is like unto it:
Forward in some respect the per
fection of the race, which has made
your culture possible. And both
may lie included in the law of all
study: Learn only that you may
yourself create. For only through
this divine power of creation is any
one really man; without it he is
only a tolerably clever machine.

It is the business of every scholar
to do something to extend the
domains of knowledge in at least
some one direction, lie can not
afford all his life long to cultivate
nature and knowledge 011 all sides;
one life would never sullice even
to acquire a knowledge of what
the past has done in many depart
ments of thought and what is yet
to be done; and so that life and
its powers would be lost to the
world to which they should have
been consecrate. To some it may
lie painful to think that we must
live on and die and leave many a
wide field of knowledge untraversed
and unknown. This longing to
learn everything is in itself a noble
element of our nature, and leads to
noble results; but it requires to be
checked by the stern voice of duty.
Otherwise we should be living to
self—living off the world's bounty.
The world owes no man anything;
but every man owes the world all
that he has and is, for the growth
of the past has made the possibili
ties of the present. No one has a
right to labor for his own enjoy
ment merely or keep bis education
for his own gratification. Every
true scholar, therefore, must, ac
cording to taste or natural capacity
or previous training, make his
choice of that side of his nature to
which he will give the preference,
and, after the foundation of the
pyramid of his education has been
laid broad and strong, rear the
superstructure, narrowing as it
aspires, llis own culture in its
other departments must be left to
take care of itself. Therein con
sists the higher sacrifice. And the
more useful the scholar's life is to
be, the higher wili be the sacrifice
he must make, and the more he
will have to surrender of that very
culture without which his genius
would have been unstable and
helpless. He lias no choice in the
matter. He must turn his back
upon many an avenue for self
culture opened up to him by nature
in order to devote ail his natural
gifts and all his acquired powers
to the superior development of one
or more capacities.
But for a student to specialize on
one line too early in his career is
to deprive himself of the half of his
soul and shut himself up too early to
a trade. That is technical training,
not education. If professional
training is a benefit, it is so in
greater or less degree according to
the measure of the culture and at
tainment which one brings to such
study. Ail professional training,
all specializing, if it is going 10
accomplish that which is best in
its own sphere, must he built up
like our pyramid, step by step,
upon the foundations of a culture
br ad and deep. And the higher
we build the pyramid of special
knowledge, the broader and deeper
must its foundations have been
laid aid the more carefully must
these have been calculated for that
special superstructure they are to
bear. This is the realm of the
human mind. Without that, law,
medicine, or any other profession
is practically helpless. We can
not take hoys from 1 lie byways and
hedges, teach them to read and
write and do simple sums, then
give them a two or three years'
course in a medical school and ex
pect them to do much for the last
ing betterment of the human race.
Here and there one or two may,
through chance or through some
God-given talent, help somewhat
to that end, but we have no reason
to expect that with the preparation
they have had they will succeed in
doing so. We force into every

profession boys (and girls) from
our lower schools with minds ab
solutely untrained and utterly in
capable of living up to the best
they might, if it were not for our
American weakness of being for
ever in a rush. Our colleges have
made provision for meeting just
this difficulty, but in our overhaste
to get into the struggle for exist
ence that provision is ignored. If
there is any one thing which more
than another distinguishes our
American university from other
universities it is this: that whereas
the German university exists for
the production of scholars, in
vestigators, and the English uni
versity for the production of
clergymen and the polish of young
noblemen, the American university
exists primarily for purposes of
culture —the culture of the common
man. The question of usefulness
or of "practical" value in this
culture stage of higher education is
now, we may happily say, among
educated men but very seldom
raised; or if it is raised, it is only
for the purpose of putting it down
the more effectually. In the pro
duction of culture everything de
pends upon truth; practical utility
(in the vulgar sense) is altogether
a secondary matter, in the truer
sense of the word, anything is
practical that makes a man or a
community or a state or a nation
stronger or better or wiser, any
thing that helps a man to live up
to the best that is in him, to be
true to himself, to bis neighbor,
and to bis God. That is practical
and nothing else is, except as it is
wrought through such a medium.
The scholar's work may bring him
in his daily bread, yes, even
wealth. But that is only inci
dental; it is not the most real nor
the noblest function of his work,
nor even the most practical.
But whatever your education, it
must be returned with proper in
crease tc> the world that gave it to
you. Of what use to your college
or your country or this world, to
whose betterment your best should
be consecrated —of what use to any
body or anything but yourself, is
your education if you become not
the leaders of thought and the
teachers of those who follow to
make up the forces that make for
righteousness and the advancement
of truth? Your first calling is that
you be witnesses of the Truth.
Every scholar, every educated man,
to live out the best of which he is
capable, must be the "living spirit
of knowledge"; he ought to be
morally the best man of his age,
and he must in some way or other
be a teacher, whatever bis other
profession or professions in life;
and "they that be teachers shall
shine as the brightness of the firm
ament, and they that turn many
to righteousaess as the stars for
ever and ever.''
You that have attained so much
of the skill required to overcome
and correct the improper tendencies
of the natural man, to combat
ignorance and vice and build up in
their place knowledge and right
eousness; you that have acquired
so much of culture that you are
ready to be sent forth into the
world to do —to teach and to bless
—remember always that you are
destined to act and react with a
most powerful influence upon hu
manity. Whether the circle of
your influence be wide or narrow,
the culture you have received is to
be extended to others and every
where to lift up our common
brotherhood to a higher plane of
living.
We have made it our highest
aim to contribute to the culture
and elevation of humanity in you
and in all with whom you may
ever have a common point of con
tact. All knowledge and all sci
ence that we may command, which
does not tend to that end, is vain
and worthless. How successful it
shall be in attaining that end has
depended upon the spirit in which
you have received what has been
afforded here and will depend also
upon the spirit and faithfulness
with which you carry further the
lessons of truth you have learned
and upon the increase and trans
mission of the power you have
made your own. You go forth
believing in the ultimate triumph
of the good, with your ideals of
what humanity ought to be; is
humanity up to your ideal? If
not, then you can not be true to
yourself, to your neighbor, or to
your God, if you fail to devote all
your best powers, your best self, to
the elevation of the humanity you
find about you up to the ideals you
cherish for yourselves.
You have your life problems to
face, not alone tbese literary, in
tellectual, and educational prob
lems the proper solution of which
will raise us above the present
''hopeful level of Philistine vulgar
ity" which we are accused of occu
pying, and make us to be leaders
ot the world in things of pure in
tellect as well as in lines of
mechanical application of scientific
principles; that is yours to bring
about; but you have also just
as serious social, economic, and
political problems, and the world
looks to you to solve them. The
questions of finance must be
answered by college men; the rela
tion of capital to labor, the question
of trusts, of marriage and divorce,
and of the reform of municipal
government, the annihilation of
that worst enemy of education and
morals, that legalized destroyer of
men and property —the saloon—
these are grave problems which
call for the application of the best
minds and strongest characters our
colleges can develop.
"The old order changeth, yielding place
to new,
And God fulfills Himself in many ways,
Lest one good custom should corrupt t he
world."
The land in which we live is
called "the New World," and our
individual lot is cast in the newest
part of it. The problems, educa
tional as well as political, which
our country has had to face are,
many of them, new. We have
grown up, as far as we have grown
at all, under the stimulus of condi
tions all our own. We have been
bound by no distant past nor
necessarily hampered by the tradi
tions of the lands from which our
fathers came. Most of our short
national life has so far been an
experiment. What the experiment
will prove will he known when our
young western world has grown to
age. In the meantime all the
civilized world is watching with
eager eyes each new stage of our
experimenting. In our present
state we are generally accused of
being a nation of mediocrity, except
in bulk. One century has seen us
suddenly transformed from three
million subject colonists on the
Atlantic sea-board into a nation of
sixty million sovereign citizens
whose dominions reach from ocean
to ocean. Similarly our culture is
full grown hut immature, like a
boy of sixteen six feet tall. The
like of our system (or want of sys
tem) of education was never seen
nor ever dreamed of before. Our
grammar school may find its
counterpart in the old world; but
our American high school is
neither the English grammar
school nor the German gymnasium
nor the French Lycee. Our Amer
ican college may he the outgrowth
of the Oxford and Cambridge idea
further developed, but the Amer
ican university is not the Englisl
university nor the German univer
sity. It is a mixed product grown
up under new conditions on new
soil.
Europe makes merry over our
481 colleges and universities and
wonders how they all manage to
exist. Never mind Europe; we do
the same ourselves. Hut our col
leges which we count by hundreds
are a necessary link in the evolu
tion of a coming educational system
worthy of our western civilization;
for as they are, they represent and
foster the spirit of our national
life. Every nation must in her
own way show that she has abiding
in her the love of truth; and that
love can best be cherished only in
ways that conform to her own
character and promise the fulfill
ment of her own purposes. In the
development to which we look for
ward, who can say that we have
too many colleges now? They will
rather be found too few. There is
scarcely a community in the length
and breadth of our land that would
not gladly make large sacrifices to
secure in its midst the location of a
promising college and so increase
the present list. When the ideal
of the American university is real
ized and the college of to-day falls
into its natural place as a school of

culture and of preparation for the
higher university of tomorrow, we
shall find that we have after all
too few rather than too many col
leges. Such a result Would be hut
another of history's repetitions.
For the first twelve years of higher
education in Michigan, when uni
versities did not mean much more
in the way of education than high
schools do now, that commonwealth
had no less than nine state colleges.
They all struggled along at starva
tion rates. Hut they were far from
being a menace to society or a
danger to education. For as one
of the nine grew into a university,
the other eight, as was right and
best, fell into their natural place as
preparatory schools of a high order
feeders for the one real univer
sity. And today we regret only
that there had not been more of
those "starveling" colleges to follow
the same course. Now that ideals
have grown upward and expanded,
the same development may take
place to our well-being on the pres
ent higher plane. Our college cur-

riculum lias undergone wondrous
changes in the last '200 years; the
garment that was placed upon the
American college in its infancy has
heen long since outgrown, and the
patterns after which it was cut are
no longer in fashion. The oldest
of our colleges is, in comparison
with Paris and Oxford, as far as
years are concerned, still in its
childhood. And who knows hut
the spirit that planted these 4<Sl
colleges will yet realize its fulfill
ment in the "true idea of a univer
sity''? What will that consumma
tion be?
Our present system (if what we
have may fairly he called a system)
is a development, with the various
additions and other changes that
come with growth, out of the edu
cation of past ages. In order to
determine what the next stage in
its growth will he we must examine
the history of its growth through
the past and the conditions and
tendencies of its present stage.
Our whole modern civilization in
its existent forms, this age of steel
and steam and electricity, with all
its triumphs of applied science in

the creation of great labor-saving
machinery, in rapid transit and the
annihilation of distance and time,
is a wondrous growth, exceeding in
this one century in these particu
lars the sum total of all that pre
vious history has recorded. Hut
follow this marvelous shoot down
ward to the stem and we shall find
that it is after all a graft. "The
same," to use Professor William
Smith's figure, "The same was en
grafted upon the sturdy stem of the
olden culture, a stem that struck
its roots deep into the sacred soil
of Greece and Home, through the
rich accumulated alluvium of
nearly thirty centuries. Into this
graft, this new scion, the generous
sap of the ancient trunk has been
poured abundantly and a pro
digious growth and wonderful
fruitage have resulted."
The art of Greece has been the
inspiration, the wonder, and the
despair of all artists since the day
when the lofty spirit of Hellenic
greatness began to Hag. The
mythology of Greece lias become

the language of symbol among all
civilized peoples of whatever name
and tongue. The poetry, the phil
osophy, the ethics, and the science
as well as the arts of Greece,
illumine every modern classic
page. Says Alfred Baker, professor
of mathematics in Toronto: "If
we should ever think of a people —
a chosen people —who had a mes
sage and a revelation to the world,
that people was the ancient Greeks.
We owe them an incalculable debt
for our knowledge of art, literature,
and science, and of the three our
debt is perhaps greatest for their
legacy of science." Whether con
sciously or unconsciously, we build
upon foundations laid, or at least
after plans drawn, by the great
thinkers —poets, artists, philoso
phers, scientists —of the days when
man was, in both body and intel
lect, at bis best. Even this present
age of scientific education is but
continuing the work where Greece
left off, and without the pioneering
work done by the science of those
old days and without the literature
of Greece upon whose light some men
of science now see tit to turn their

backs, our own science would have
bmt forced to go back to the most
primitive conceptions of nature and
waste centuries in traveling the
roads which the classical thinkers
built through unbroken wilds and
trod for us. Others have labored
and we have entered into their
labors.
If, then, the impression left by
the Hellenic spirit upon our world
of art and letters has l>een so strong
and so abiding, what of our inher
itance of educational ideals from
the same source? And if the
disciple has not been greater than
the master in those expressions of
creative genius, has the master
been surpassed in the business of
educating men and training the
powers in them for the creation of
great ideas and great ideals?
Though ignorance may some
times sneer and "self-complacent
modernism" sometimes assail, yet
one need not be a mere praiser of
the times that are gone to assert
that that age saw, in at least some
strata of society, man at his high
est and best since his creation, both
mentally and physically. "The
theories of the seers stood the test
of application by the men of
deeds." (Butler.) And so it is
our right, and our duty as well to
ask how that condition was real
ized, and why we, with the example
of their successes and their failures
and with the addition of the spirit
that was introduced by way of
Bethlehem and Calvary, can not
attain to that and better than that
by the addition of the moral and
spiritual strength that is ours from
on high.
The problems that the young
Athenians of brains and power had
to face were not so very different
from those which confront the
young American. Their polity
was, as ours is called, a democracy
—a government of the people by
the people. Their youth must,
therefore, be fitted (and so must
ours) not only for good citizenship,
but for the highest duties of citi
zens who are also rulers. Was
their course of training for it dif
ferent from ours? Have we learned
from it all that we can apply with
advantage to our own conditions?
The feature of Athenian educa
tion that has been most overlooked
in the modern was the love of the
beautiful. This was the dominat
ing principle in education, and we
would do well not to leave the
Aesthetic sense longer in neglect.
Hellenic sanity —soundness of body
and of intellect and of all that is
produced by either —is proverbial.
And through it all must run the
golden thread of beauty. As they
developed their language to its
peerless beauty and expressiveness,
as Callicrates and Ictinus reared
their wondrous temples, as Phidias
and Praxiteles carved their statues
and Polygnotus and Apelles spread
their canvases with perfect beauty
and symmetry, so they trained the
intellect and the soul into beauty
and strength, and so they trained
the body with a view to the beauti
ful and strong; and everything
that could tend in the opposite
direction was strictly proscribed.
In general, our universities, high
schools or gymnasia, and common


PROFESSOR WALTER MILLER
schools have their prototypes in
the similar institutions of classical
Athens. The fundamental prin
ciples even of the kindergarten we
find clearly set forth in the Repub
lic of Plato and embodied in his
infant-school.
The aim of the public school was
to awaken the minds of the youth
and help them to find the place in
the world that each could fill
better than any other, and above
all to furnish that sesthetic culture
which all ages have considered
important and which some still
reckon the paramount object of
our higher education.
The theory that education, as
distinguished from special train
ing, should afford a broad general
culture and that this is best secured
by a study of "humanity," or the
"humanities," is older than Soc
rates, new as to-day. That it has
been a suitable foundation upon
which to build our own educational
systems is not too much to assert;
for it is safe to say that through
that method of education, rather
than in spite of it, men were pro
duced who were in real training of
mind, in mastery of principles and
knowledge of men, in capacity for
every form of mental effort, from
the most refined speculation to the
conduct of every day affairs of
state and of business, the most
perfectly educated people the world
has ever seen.
That sort of training aimed at
producing not professional athletes,
nor musicians, nor mathemati
cians, but men, men of thought and
of action, who should be capable
of taking front rank in whatever
special lines of activity their after
life might lead. Competition then
was no less keen than it is now;
only that man received first honors
then and eternal fame to come,
who in his day could do some one
thing better than any other man
in Athens. Xenophon,in his Edu
cation of Cyrus, brings out the
necessity they felt for trained
specialists when he says that "those
w r ho give up paying attention to
many things and devote themselves
to some one thing, they are sure to
be the best in their particular
line." But such specialization, as
his words clearly imply, was re
served until after breadth of culture
was secured.
After a preparation of this kind,
the young man might devote him
self with perfect freedom of choice
all but exclusively to some one de
partment of knowledge. To afford
this special training was the busi
ness of the university. For from
the day of Gorgias, Socrates, Plato,
Athens had taken her place as the
university city of the world; and
she maintained it (even against the
glitter of the Ptolemaic state uni
versity at Alexandria) until nar
row-minded despotism closed her
doors and smothered the fires of
knowledge, which could not die but
smouldered on beneath the ashes,
to be fanned again into living
flame with the revival of learning
in the sixteenth century. That
university had its departments of
art, science, economics, philosophy,
letters, and each great teacher was
a special department unto himself;
it was, thus constituted, a univer
sity in the truest sense of the word,
although not organized with a
board of trustees and a cast-iron
charter, a university built not of
bricks but of brains, not with
mortar but with men; and it
exerted an influence that not only
filled the world then, but has made
itself felt even until now and will
continue to be a power as long as
there are students to study.

From even this cursory sketch it
may be seen from what beginnings
all our modern systems of education
have grown. For the Greeks have
been the school-masters of the
nations ;is today is the school
master of tomorrow. When Rome
made the soil of Hellas a Roman
province but bowed in humble
submission before the power of her
captive's intellect and fell herself a
captive to Grecian arts and letters,
the Athenian education was bodily
transplanted to Italian soil. As
ime progressed, the martial vigor
of Rome became a part of the bone
and tissue of the imported culture
of the lower schools; but the uni
versity was still at Athens, though
rivalled for a time by Alexandria
and Rhodes.
Rome spread her power and her
language over all western Europe,
and the official Latin tongue be
came the first and the chief subject
of study in the schools as the only
means of social and political and
afterwards ecclesiastical advance
ment. On one ground or another,
if for nothing more than mere tra
dition, it has maintained ils place
as the first and most essential
element in educational systems
that still exist as models of all that
should be.
Barbarism and Christianity
joined hands to crush the old uni
versity centres and blot out Grecian
culture from the world. Their
success, while not absolute, was
only too complete. The extin
guishing of the light of letters left
the world in darkness and gloom
for centuries with only here and
there a flickering rush light of
logical, mystical, or ecclesiastical
subtleties. Such profound ques
tions as how many spirits could
stand together upon the point of a
cambric needle, or whether a spirit
could pass from one point to an
other without passing through the
intervening space, however absurd
and valueless they may appear,
nevertheless did serve to sharpen
men's wits and to make them
hunger and thirst after real ideas.
Whence should spring the fountain
for satisfying such thirst? Had
all possibility of real ideas van
ished from the earth? There had
been creators of ideals once; had
their products all vanished with
the departure of their culture and
their power? Through the dark
ages the capacity for ideas seems to
have died out in men. For the
world was asleep —asleep for a
thousand years of rest and re-crea
tion. In the twelfth century it
began to awake, and with the
Italian Renaissance the dead ca
pacity for ideas was reborn.
"There were many forces," says
Professor Shoup, "that worked to
gether to produce the Renaissance,
but in Italy, at least, the main
cause was the recovery and study
of the Greek and Latin classics,
aided by the ever-present object
lessons of the grandeur of Roman
architecture and the loveliness of
Greek sculpture."
Thus with the rebirth of the
Athenian spirit among men came
also the resurrection of the univer
sity idea. The mediaeval universi
ties had hitherto provided for law,
theology, and medicine. The new
movement, which saved the arts
and sciences of Greece and Rome,
now brought in the''humanities"
as the education of culture —the
philosophical faculty—and the way
was opened wide 'or the easy de
velopment of the modern univer
sity. "The culture of the classics
bad to be re-appropriated before
the movement of the modern mind
could begin." (Symonds.) It was

through them that came again the
spiritual freedom, the intellectual
culture, the powers of criticism,
of comparison, and of scientific re
search that make an ideal educa
tion possible in our own day. And
with all the advances of the "new
education" the humanities are still
the humanities, enriched by many
a wholesome increment. Amid all
the other agencies for culture they
still form the essential element to
that aesthetic culture which all
consider important and which some
consider paramount, though we all
recognize that the world has many
things to learn besides Greek and
Latin.
Out of this new shoot springing
up from the old olive stump of
intellectual Attica have branched
forth the various scions which are
our modern universities. The evo
lution of the university has been,
like evolution in the natural world,
a spiral now rising, again descend
ing upon itself, but gaining with
each new circle. And as in the
organic world old forms die and
new ones come in, not created out
of nothing, but simply transforma
tions of the old: so our modern
higher education is but the old
university ideal transformed or
transforming, but not yet glorified.
Nothing really new has been added
to the sap in the veins of the tree
of knowledge, for all the grafts
that hive been set upon it. The
kindergarten, the grammar school,
the college and the university, with
its science and letters, its co
education, its elective system and
its majors and minors—but no de
grees —are as old as Plato. Indeed,
so little has the university ideal
grown since the unrivalled intel
lectual genius of Athens at the
climax of her intellectual power
evolved it, that it may be (and
since this paragraph was penned,
has been) seriously questioned
whether there is any such thing as
the "new education." "There is
nothing new under the sun" is no
where more true or false than in
the intellectual world. Sir Henry
, Maine goes so far as to say that
"Except the blind forces of Nature,
nothing moves in this world which
is not Greek in its origin." There
have been many revivals of knowl
edge besides the Italian Renais
sance; within a few years zoology,
chemistry, and geology have all
been born again. How hard we
toil to advance knowledge by in
troducing some "new" institution,
discovering some new truth. Hut
truth is eternal; and when our dis
covery is made we find the real
meaning of the poet's words:
"Wer kan 11 was (Dummes, wer was)
Kluges denken
Das nicht die Vorweltschon gedacht?"
Through all the growth and de
velopment of both the old and the
new the purpose of the university
has been always the same: not for
learning things, but for learning
how to learn things; not for cram
ming the memory with facts and
dates, but for teaching how to ob
serve facts and to cultivate a sense
of their relativity and the spirit of
criticism; not merely for enriching
the understanding, but for the
creation of a new life, the awaken
ing of a higher, nobler, truly scien
tific spirit, the culture and develop
ment of the thinking mind.
Education is the leading of the
young up into the intellectual and
spiritual kingdom that is theirs by
right of inheritance.
Sometimes it has been forgotten
that this can not be gained through
force or by following mechanical
forms and rules; nor can it be
secured in any other atmosphere

than one of freedom, with all of its
privileges and all of its responsi
bilities. The ''winds of freedom"
also were let loose from the yEolian
cave, and only too often have they
been lashed and locked in again.
Now perfect intellectual freedom
is ours once more. The attainment
of the true ideal of education,
from the kindergarten to the acad
emy of scholars, is almost within
our grasp. Shall we in our day
realize the ideal? If so, there are
a few faults in our American edu
cation which must he eradicated,
and the whole system must he
brought into line with the general
upward trend.
In the first place, in order to
make the true ideal of American
education a reality and to secure
breadth of culture combined with
power in some special field, tlie
work of the lower schools must be
made more thorough and more
effective. Those of our secondary
schools whose avowed purpose is to
fit its pupils for college, and that,
too, for some particular college, are
by far the most satisfactory in their
results. But in general our chil
dren come out of the common
school with little interest in the
higher life, iittle feeling and less
power of expressing the feeling
they have. They have no more
yearning after culture and sym
metrical training and healthy
growth than has the rose-bush in
the garden. The same reform that
will put a new spirit into our sec
ondary schools to render them
more effective will necessarily bring
with it a more desirable saving of
time for securing in college the
breadth of culture needed for the
most effective specializing in some
one fieid of knowledge afterward.
Then, in the second place, we
need some real system of organic
connection between our various
schools. There should be no leaps
in the mental development any
more than there are in natural
growth; as it is, however, our pupils
must successfully make several
before they reach the blissful goal
of an academic degree. The sec
ondary school has no rational
connection with the primary de
partment on the one hand; and on
the other, while it does not pretend
itself to be the apex of any educa
tional system, it still has as an
institution no vital connection with
the higher seminaries of learning.
It has begun, to the no small detri
ment of the youth, to ape univer
stiv methods —encouragingchildren
in knickerbockers and short skirts
to pursue all their knowledge, sci
entific, literary, and historical, back
to its ultimate sources! And that,
before they, or even nine-tenths of
their teachers, know what an ulti
mate source is, or how to judge one
critically if they should happen to
stumble upon it! Nothing could
be further from the real purpose of
the high school than the production
of scholarship.
And as the secondary education
has not yet settled down into its
own proper sphere, so the university
has not been able to draw its own
differentiating line just where it
ought to be, and seems compelled
to teach high school subjects in
high school ways. There is as
little propriety in the university's
whipping bad English into shape
and drilling on the elements of
Latin or French or German as
there is in the high school's at
tempting to teach Roman history
from ''the sources."
When lines are properly drawn
and the desired organic connection
made, we may see a straight and
steady growth from infancy to
scholarship with an appreciable
saving of precious years now
wasted through lack of definite
purpose. Our secondary schools
will he an immediate continuation
of the primary; the high schuol
and the college will cease to overlap
each other; and the college or uni
versity will in its turn be a contin
uation of the high schuol as the
high school of the grammar school,
but necessarily something more;
not even this institution, however,
may be regarded as a factory for
turning out scholars; the under
graduate college will be a place
where, with the help of great
teachers, great libraries and lab
oratories, any student may find the
training that will give him culture
and strength. In the case of those
who have not already set their in
tellectual ambitions upon some
definite line of life work the culture
must be particularly broad that it
may find their peculiar talents out
and awaken their love for that
work which they are best adapted
to do. The university, as it is, is
not for the purpose of making
scholars, but for developing the
men and women out of whom
scholars, investigators, teachers,
statesmen, may be made. It is not
necessary, nor even desirable, that
all our masses should be scholars;
the best "out-living" is not likely
to be given by one whose time is
wholly spent over ancient manu
scripts or over a microscope. To
live a life of righteousness, to do no
wrong to any man, to master one's
own self, to serve God and one's
fellow-men —all that needs no
scholarly erudition. But no one's
culture — the upbuilding and
strengthening of all that is good in
him, wide range of intellect and
knowledge—can be too deep or too
broad. That may be called the
fundamental idea of our American
colleges and universities, and here
in may be found the highest boast
of our education, as it has been:
that without definite regard for a
learned profession, it affords the
possibility of an all-round train
ing, a broadening and elevating
culture for the common man,
widening his horizon and enabling
him to see truth and live truth.
Hut even with this it is evident
that our system is not, and never
has been, complete. We feel that
most when we follow up the differ
ent stages of the instructing body
as we have outlined the different
degrees of schools. Our teaching
can nowhere be better than the
teachers. Where are these trained?
Whence comes the great army of
teachers for our primary schools?
In general, from the secondary
schools. Whence the teachers of
the secondary schools? Nearly all
of them from the colleges and uni
versities. And where are the
teachers in the colleges and uni
versities trained? With few ex
ceptions, like most of our children's
doll's and hobby-horses, and for the
same reason, they bear the familiar
stamp, "Made in Germany." The
explanation is in either case the
same: Germany has the appli
ances for their production. Our
own want in this particular has
been felt ever since' the days of
Washington. The graduate de
partments appended to almost
every ambitious university in the
land are incontrovertible testimony
to the fact that in America we do
need and do want universities like
or superior to the German uni
versities. Academies of science, in
a feeble way, we already have.
The whole lower school is a great
mental gymnasium; everything is
aimed at training, developing; be

tween the master and the pupil
there is intellectually a great gulf;
for every exercise the master puts
the pupil through is to tne latter
dillicult, but to the former simple.
In the university this distance be
tween teacher and taught is less
ened. The student comes with
powers trained and his capacity
approximates more nearly that of
the instructor, while the latter is
for the same reason ready to meet
him more than half way. While
our college professors are perform
ing the double functions of in
vestigators and teachers they are
indeed doing their most teliing
personal work, the work that will
impress their personality most
imperishably upon the after world
and make themselves immortal;
but if their first and highest aim is
the advancement of their particular
science through their own personal
investigation, then every hour of
elementary instruction is a brake
upon the wheels of their power,
every hour's lecture that is made
to tit the needs of learners repre
sents so much time and energy
diverted from their proper channel.
We often hear of young men in
search of college positions who are
•'brilliant scholars," but dismal
failures as teachers. Their place
is not in the instructor's chair,
where their efforts at teaching will
be, both to themselves and to the
students, worse than wasted. If
they are investigators, our country
sh uld have a place for them, with
libraries, laboratories, and observa
tories, as well as for the teachers
who are scholars only less devoted
to the prosecution of research be
cause they have the spirit of teach
ing. The real investigator's best
will be attained only by giving
himself up absolutely to learning,
to pushing forward the outposts
of investigation and widening the
circuit of thought and knowledge
and never relaxing from the exer
tion of his highest power. These
are the men who can afford to
specialize in one small field of
science to the exclusion of every
thing else that is of interest to
humanity. Their work also is
essential to the advancement of the
race and to the growth of educa
tion; and the perfect educational
system must have a place for them
and for their work. One such
university our country already has
and will soon, we trust, have an
other —the National University—
to foster investigation and train
scholars, and so raise up the whole
standard of our national educa
tion. Thus, through the common
feature of instruction, the college
has its organic connection with the
high school; while it joins hands
with the higher universities through
the seminaries and laboratories
where the scholar that is to be is
trained in methods of independent
research and discovery of truth.
And when this idea 1 is consum
mated in our land; when those of
the colleges that can do so become
universities and those that can not
become universities fall naturally
into their places as training schools
for the real universities; then we
shall have a genuine system of edu
cation,and the National University
or Academy will be the pinnacle of
that system, rising as high above
our colleges as they above the
common schools.
The last defect to mention is the
most serious and will lie the most
difficult to correct, for it is the
most insidious and the most deeply
rooted. The curse of our edu a
tional spirit is "the tendency to look
upon education as a mere tool for
money-getting." Those who look

upon know ledge only from the stand
point of "practical" utility are likely
to seein the university only a bureau
for the delivery of special informa
tion, a mere warehouse for literary,
medical, or legal merchandise, in
stead of a temple of knowledge
and truth. The enrichment of
knowledge and power is not con
sidered and therefore not desired.
Too general is the conception in
our land that nothing is practical,
nothing is useful, even in matters
of pure intellect, unless it can be
translated into dollars and cents.
Art' we, brain and brawn, so wholly
enslaved to Mammon? Nay, can
it be denied that the same master
is enslaving, or has already en
slaved, even the intellectual pro
fessions —the bar, the bench, the
clinic, the chair, the studio, and
even the pulpit ? "Even where
science, art, and literature, the
things of the mind, are pursued
after a fashion, it is too often not
as an end, but as a means, not for
love, but to get rich or at least to
make a living." And for that very
reason it is usually "only after a
fashion' 1 that they are pursued.
To him who studies literature,
philosophy, or mathematics only as
a means to such an end, even
these pursuits of pure intellect are
as much a "bread and butter edu
cation" as law or medicine to him
who has no higher interest in his
science than financial advantage
to himself.
It is a matter for regret that
higher education has not more
frequently as its object disinterested
culture —the enriching and beauti
fying of the soul —but only the
practical, financial advantage of
the student. How few study Greek
and Latin and higher mathematics
any more just for the sake of know
ing them or as a means of calling
forth power, of cultivating taste
and character, right ambition, and
interest in great and high themes!
Is not the incentive to such studies
in these days rather a desire to
pass the examinations and get into
college, or, sometimes, to make a
living by teaching them, which is,
after all, only another way of
serving a selfish purpose? If they
could not be turned to immediate,
practical advantage, they would be
studied much less than they are.
In precisely the same way, most
students study physics or chemistry
not for the philosophic delight of
finding out the secrets of nature,
but solely to find through them a
means of livelihood, and, haply,
a certain advantage in the struggle
for wealth.
With all these faults and virtues
in view 1 come today to plead not
alone for the old education of
proper morals, polished manners,
elegant speech, nor yet for the new
education of exclusive science, but
for a proper balance between the
old and the new —the culture of
the humanities and of nature as a
basis for later specialization; and
for the concentration of all one's
ability afterward on some one por
tion of the vast lield of science and
knowledge. The principle upon
which the whole plea is based is
that true education must, have
three dimensions, length, breadth
and depth. Of these breadth must
be provided for in the undergradu
ate college course; the opportunity
will never come again, and can
never come again. Depth can
be added only in the special
training of the graduate university
and after study. Length is a rel
ative dimension depending upon
the length and intensity of life.
Hut all three must begin together.
The danger against which this

warning signal is raised is that
'specialization before breadth is
attained will prove to be not power
and culture, but weakness and nar
rowness. . . . It will be the Same,
whatever the line of premature
specialization. Exclusive devotion
from the beginning to the arts and
letters is ruinous to our best devel
opment, even though that has been
the proved and approved higher
education of the last four hundred
years. . . . And yet by confining
ourselves to such a course we come
to live so much in the realm of the
ideal that we ignore or forget the
real things around us. The great
literatures of the world are not our
only source of truth, nor the only
scene of beauty, nor the only
means of culture. The whole busi
ness of any man is to know and to
live the truth. He must have eyes
that will see truth wherever it may
be fmnd; and there are even
clearer, surer revelations of truth
in (Jod's world around us than in
the world of letters.
We must not fail to recognize
that there are some intellectual
constitutions which utterly refuse
to assimilate culture from scientific
study. So much the worse for
them, in like manner there are
many minds wholly unsusceptible
to the charms of classical poetry.
The more the pity for that. People
thus constituted will have to make
the best they can of a one-sided
culture; if they will only do the
best they can, their culture, for
which the university makes provi
sion, will not have been secured in
vain.
We are all in sympathy with
Professor Virchow'sdefinition: that
the aim of university study is gen
eral scientific and moral culture
together with the mastery of one
special department of study. We
have here at this university a prac
tical plan which has in itself all
the requisite qualities for realizing
the ideal condition of tilings. No
lixed curriculum or system of re
quired studies leading up to a de
gree can furnish to any number of
different minds the culture which
each one needs. Here the student
must have bis own central pur
pose, and it must be an earnest
purpose; toward that, as a central
axis of his life, all other radiating
lines must point. Whether these
radiating lines of light shall be
focused in all their intensity on
one single point, or illumine all
bis path through life and brighten
and help all who cross it there,
depends mainly on the individual
student's aims, but partly also on
him to whom that student looks
for special counsel.
At any rate, narrow specializing
should not begin until the student's
mind is thoroughly disciplined.
Whether that discipline is best
secured in the old-fashioned way
with Latin, Greek, and mathe
matics is a question which has two
good sides for debate. "There is,"
to quote from our President, "much
to be said in favor of the college in
which discipline pure and simple is
made the chief end of all the work.
In such a school those subjects —
languages, sciences, and philosophy
—which serve the ends of training
best, should be taught, and such
subjects only."
When we consider the two great
new principles of our age —the
conservation of energy with all the
wonders it has made possible in
the material world, and biological
evolution with all the marvels it
will produce in not only the phys
ical, but also the intellectual and
| spiritual well-being of the race —
the irresistible attractiveness of the
new education, the triumph of the
scientific education over iill compe
tition, and the preponderating
tendency of students of "practical"
minds to confine themselves to the
scientific education, are easily com
prehended. The educational pen
dulum has been steadily swinging
backward and forward ever since
modern education in the fifteenth
century began, first to one extreme,
and then to the other, as if no
middle ground were possible. Uni
versities were new things when the
Renaissance came. They had
been founded for "practical" pur
poses; and to the devotees of the
"practical" courses the introduction
of the classics was an innovation,
and the new learning was frowned
upon. The humanists of the Refor
mation period had a battle to fight
against tremendous odds. In order
to maintain any place at all, they
had to prove that literature was
delightful for its own sake, and
that Greece and Rome had some
thing worth while to teach to mod
ern men. The struggle was soon
over; the pendulum began to swing
ihe other way; the new learning
triumphed throughout all Europe;
and from the revival of learning
down almost to within the memory
of men still living, any education
without a good strong backbone of
Greek and Latin classics was no
education. Education meant clas
sical education. Hut human nature
rebels against extreme?, and as
surely as extremes prevail, so surely
will come reaction against them.
Thus again after the middle of the
last century, when new life caught
on the souls of men, and lifted
them out of the social and political
corruption of the times, when the
Encyclopedists, as the precursors of
the great Revolution, began the
revolution in the realms of science,
then again came the flight to
antiquity as the only source from
which to gain afresh the elements
of intellectual and artistic life. To
those great crises in civilization, to
those accomplishments of a race
of intellectual giants, humanity
returns again and again as to a
fountain of spiritual youth eternally
fresh and strong.
It is as strange now to reflect
that to the foolish conservatives of
four hundred years ago the classics
were an intolerable innovation, as
it is to think that Huxley and his
compeers had to contend so long
and so hard for the claims of sci
ence to recognition as a force for
culture in a modern education.
And now that the educational
sceptre has passed from classics to
science, and the scientific spirit
dominates every sphere, its more
radical advocates would crowd
entirely out of the field its most
formidable rival, the time-honored
humanistic culture, as having no
place whatever in an up-to-date
education. The pendulum hits
once more swung as far as it can
go. That spirit of science which
is intolerant, whether it is philo
logical science that inveighs against
natural science or natural science
that will allow no place to philo
logical science, is the primal cause
of the violent reactions that come
in the lines of education; that
readiness for revulsion is one of
the things that argue most potently
for the final triumph of breadth.
Intolerance is the child of narrow
ness of spirit; and when we all
dwell together in harmony, each
recognizing the value of all lines
of culture, breadth is assured.
And if Mr. King is right in
his estimate of the purely scientific
mind unbalanced by those mental

pursuits that feed the fancy, en
noble the sentiments, enable us to
enjoy beauty and harmony —and
the ardent advocate of the human
ities is easily persuaded to believe
him —then there is sure to come
against the technical scientific
education so fashionable in our
day a reaction strong enough to
bring about a tremendous revival
of the humanities, in the most
comprehensive sense of the word;
or, if a compromise can be effected,
it may at last stop the swinging
pendulum in'the middle and pro
duce the harmonious blending of
the two cultures that will give us
the full liberal education for which
this plea is made.
With a well-balanced education,
that antiquated narrow contempt
of the new education for the old
will he entirely forgotten. Then
in the eyes of the scientist the
humanist will 110 longer be a man
who can not '"see beyond the horizon
of his own shallow experience, and
who from his self-constructed
throne judges the rest of mankind
with the complacent assurance born
of a fancied superiority." Nor will
the humanist find in this promised
land so many Philistines —"full of
narrowness, full of prejudices, with
a defective type of religion, a nar
row range of intellect and knowl
edge, a stunted sense of beauty, a
low standard of manners, arid
averse, moreover, to whatever may
disturb it in its vulgarity " With
this breadth of intellectual culture,
and the physical culture that our
human nature demands and de
serves, our youth may with joy
enter into their six-fold inher
itance, physical, scientific, literary,
aesthetic, political, and religious,
which is their indisputable birth
right; and thus equipped they may
transmit it preserved and, in some
chosen field, enriched, to genera
tions yet to come. Lame, at least,
is the institution of learning that
withholds from its students any
one of the six.
The world's call is for the man
of learning who knows better than
any one elst how to do some one
thing; but he cannot meet the re
quirements if he knows nothing
but that one thing; he must know
it in its relation to other things; he
must see things in their proper
proportion. "What science and
practical life alike need," says
Professor Butler, "is not narrow
men, but broad men sharpened to a
point."
Let our new education be not a
vertical line, but a pyramid, of
which our present undergraduate
courses shall furnish the base large
and broad and solid; and let the
university of the future, and, until
it is realized, the graduate depart
ments of the present, supply the
apex. It may cost many a reluc
tant sacrifice of intellectual plea
sures as the narrowing process
begins and many more as it con
tinues. It may be painful, but it
is necessary. For in this day of
specialization only the specialist
can work out the best that is in
him and render back to society
what it has done for him. The
first law of the fullest perfection
says: He perfect; that is, cultivate
all your powers completely and
uniformly—as far as possible. And
the second law is like unto it:
Forward in some respect the per
fection of the race, which has made
your culture possible. And both
may lie included in the law of all
study: Learn only that you may
yourself create. For only through
this divine power of creation is any
one really man; without it he is
only a tolerably clever machine.

It is the business of every scholar
to do something to extend the
domains of knowledge in at least
some one direction, lie can not
afford all his life long to cultivate
nature and knowledge 011 all sides;
one life would never sullice even
to acquire a knowledge of what
the past has done in many depart
ments of thought and what is yet
to be done; and so that life and
its powers would be lost to the
world to which they should have
been consecrate. To some it may
lie painful to think that we must
live on and die and leave many a
wide field of knowledge untraversed
and unknown. This longing to
learn everything is in itself a noble
element of our nature, and leads to
noble results; but it requires to be
checked by the stern voice of duty.
Otherwise we should be living to
self—living off the world's bounty.
The world owes no man anything;
but every man owes the world all
that he has and is, for the growth
of the past has made the possibili
ties of the present. No one has a
right to labor for his own enjoy
ment merely or keep bis education
for his own gratification. Every
true scholar, therefore, must, ac
cording to taste or natural capacity
or previous training, make his
choice of that side of his nature to
which he will give the preference,
and, after the foundation of the
pyramid of his education has been
laid broad and strong, rear the
superstructure, narrowing as it
aspires, llis own culture in its
other departments must be left to
take care of itself. Therein con
sists the higher sacrifice. And the
more useful the scholar's life is to
be, the higher wili be the sacrifice
he must make, and the more he
will have to surrender of that very
culture without which his genius
would have been unstable and
helpless. He lias no choice in the
matter. He must turn his back
upon many an avenue for self
culture opened up to him by nature
in order to devote ail his natural
gifts and all his acquired powers
to the superior development of one
or more capacities.
But for a student to specialize on
one line too early in his career is
to deprive himself of the half of his
soul and shut himself up too early to
a trade. That is technical training,
not education. If professional
training is a benefit, it is so in
greater or less degree according to
the measure of the culture and at
tainment which one brings to such
study. Ail professional training,
all specializing, if it is going 10
accomplish that which is best in
its own sphere, must he built up
like our pyramid, step by step,
upon the foundations of a culture
br ad and deep. And the higher
we build the pyramid of special
knowledge, the broader and deeper
must its foundations have been
laid aid the more carefully must
these have been calculated for that
special superstructure they are to
bear. This is the realm of the
human mind. Without that, law,
medicine, or any other profession
is practically helpless. We can
not take hoys from 1 lie byways and
hedges, teach them to read and
write and do simple sums, then
give them a two or three years'
course in a medical school and ex
pect them to do much for the last
ing betterment of the human race.
Here and there one or two may,
through chance or through some
God-given talent, help somewhat
to that end, but we have no reason
to expect that with the preparation
they have had they will succeed in
doing so. We force into every

profession boys (and girls) from
our lower schools with minds ab
solutely untrained and utterly in
capable of living up to the best
they might, if it were not for our
American weakness of being for
ever in a rush. Our colleges have
made provision for meeting just
this difficulty, but in our overhaste
to get into the struggle for exist
ence that provision is ignored. If
there is any one thing which more
than another distinguishes our
American university from other
universities it is this: that whereas
the German university exists for
the production of scholars, in
vestigators, and the English uni
versity for the production of
clergymen and the polish of young
noblemen, the American university
exists primarily for purposes of
culture —the culture of the common
man. The question of usefulness
or of "practical" value in this
culture stage of higher education is
now, we may happily say, among
educated men but very seldom
raised; or if it is raised, it is only
for the purpose of putting it down
the more effectually. In the pro
duction of culture everything de
pends upon truth; practical utility
(in the vulgar sense) is altogether
a secondary matter, in the truer
sense of the word, anything is
practical that makes a man or a
community or a state or a nation
stronger or better or wiser, any
thing that helps a man to live up
to the best that is in him, to be
true to himself, to bis neighbor,
and to bis God. That is practical
and nothing else is, except as it is
wrought through such a medium.
The scholar's work may bring him
in his daily bread, yes, even
wealth. But that is only inci
dental; it is not the most real nor
the noblest function of his work,
nor even the most practical.
But whatever your education, it
must be returned with proper in
crease tc> the world that gave it to
you. Of what use to your college
or your country or this world, to
whose betterment your best should
be consecrated —of what use to any
body or anything but yourself, is
your education if you become not
the leaders of thought and the
teachers of those who follow to
make up the forces that make for
righteousness and the advancement
of truth? Your first calling is that
you be witnesses of the Truth.
Every scholar, every educated man,
to live out the best of which he is
capable, must be the "living spirit
of knowledge"; he ought to be
morally the best man of his age,
and he must in some way or other
be a teacher, whatever bis other
profession or professions in life;
and "they that be teachers shall
shine as the brightness of the firm
ament, and they that turn many
to righteousaess as the stars for
ever and ever.''
You that have attained so much
of the skill required to overcome
and correct the improper tendencies
of the natural man, to combat
ignorance and vice and build up in
their place knowledge and right
eousness; you that have acquired
so much of culture that you are
ready to be sent forth into the
world to do —to teach and to bless
—remember always that you are
destined to act and react with a
most powerful influence upon hu
manity. Whether the circle of
your influence be wide or narrow,
the culture you have received is to
be extended to others and every
where to lift up our common
brotherhood to a higher plane of
living.
We have made it our highest
aim to contribute to the culture
and elevation of humanity in you
and in all with whom you may
ever have a common point of con
tact. All knowledge and all sci
ence that we may command, which
does not tend to that end, is vain
and worthless. How successful it
shall be in attaining that end has
depended upon the spirit in which
you have received what has been
afforded here and will depend also
upon the spirit and faithfulness
with which you carry further the
lessons of truth you have learned
and upon the increase and trans
mission of the power you have
made your own. You go forth
believing in the ultimate triumph
of the good, with your ideals of
what humanity ought to be; is
humanity up to your ideal? If
not, then you can not be true to
yourself, to your neighbor, or to
your God, if you fail to devote all
your best powers, your best self, to
the elevation of the humanity you
find about you up to the ideals you
cherish for yourselves.
You have your life problems to
face, not alone tbese literary, in
tellectual, and educational prob
lems the proper solution of which
will raise us above the present
''hopeful level of Philistine vulgar
ity" which we are accused of occu
pying, and make us to be leaders
ot the world in things of pure in
tellect as well as in lines of
mechanical application of scientific
principles; that is yours to bring
about; but you have also just
as serious social, economic, and
political problems, and the world
looks to you to solve them. The
questions of finance must be
answered by college men; the rela
tion of capital to labor, the question
of trusts, of marriage and divorce,
and of the reform of municipal
government, the annihilation of
that worst enemy of education and
morals, that legalized destroyer of
men and property —the saloon—
these are grave problems which
call for the application of the best
minds and strongest characters our
colleges can develop.
"The old order changeth, yielding place
to new,
And God fulfills Himself in many ways,
Lest one good custom should corrupt t he
world."
The land in which we live is
called "the New World," and our
individual lot is cast in the newest
part of it. The problems, educa
tional as well as political, which
our country has had to face are,
many of them, new. We have
grown up, as far as we have grown
at all, under the stimulus of condi
tions all our own. We have been
bound by no distant past nor
necessarily hampered by the tradi
tions of the lands from which our
fathers came. Most of our short
national life has so far been an
experiment. What the experiment
will prove will he known when our
young western world has grown to
age. In the meantime all the
civilized world is watching with
eager eyes each new stage of our
experimenting. In our present
state we are generally accused of
being a nation of mediocrity, except
in bulk. One century has seen us
suddenly transformed from three
million subject colonists on the
Atlantic sea-board into a nation of
sixty million sovereign citizens
whose dominions reach from ocean
to ocean. Similarly our culture is
full grown hut immature, like a
boy of sixteen six feet tall. The
like of our system (or want of sys
tem) of education was never seen
nor ever dreamed of before. Our
grammar school may find its
counterpart in the old world; but
our American high school is
neither the English grammar
school nor the German gymnasium
nor the French Lycee. Our Amer
ican college may he the outgrowth
of the Oxford and Cambridge idea
further developed, but the Amer
ican university is not the Englisl
university nor the German univer
sity. It is a mixed product grown
up under new conditions on new
soil.
Europe makes merry over our
481 colleges and universities and
wonders how they all manage to
exist. Never mind Europe; we do
the same ourselves. Hut our col
leges which we count by hundreds
are a necessary link in the evolu
tion of a coming educational system
worthy of our western civilization;
for as they are, they represent and
foster the spirit of our national
life. Every nation must in her
own way show that she has abiding
in her the love of truth; and that
love can best be cherished only in
ways that conform to her own
character and promise the fulfill
ment of her own purposes. In the
development to which we look for
ward, who can say that we have
too many colleges now? They will
rather be found too few. There is
scarcely a community in the length
and breadth of our land that would
not gladly make large sacrifices to
secure in its midst the location of a
promising college and so increase
the present list. When the ideal
of the American university is real
ized and the college of to-day falls
into its natural place as a school of

culture and of preparation for the
higher university of tomorrow, we
shall find that we have after all
too few rather than too many col
leges. Such a result Would be hut
another of history's repetitions.
For the first twelve years of higher
education in Michigan, when uni
versities did not mean much more
in the way of education than high
schools do now, that commonwealth
had no less than nine state colleges.
They all struggled along at starva
tion rates. Hut they were far from
being a menace to society or a
danger to education. For as one
of the nine grew into a university,
the other eight, as was right and
best, fell into their natural place as
preparatory schools of a high order
feeders for the one real univer
sity. And today we regret only
that there had not been more of
those "starveling" colleges to follow
the same course. Now that ideals
have grown upward and expanded,
the same development may take
place to our well-being on the pres
ent higher plane. Our college cur-

riculum lias undergone wondrous
changes in the last '200 years; the
garment that was placed upon the
American college in its infancy has
heen long since outgrown, and the
patterns after which it was cut are
no longer in fashion. The oldest
of our colleges is, in comparison
with Paris and Oxford, as far as
years are concerned, still in its
childhood. And who knows hut
the spirit that planted these 4<Sl
colleges will yet realize its fulfill
ment in the "true idea of a univer
sity''? What will that consumma
tion be?
Our present system (if what we
have may fairly he called a system)
is a development, with the various
additions and other changes that
come with growth, out of the edu
cation of past ages. In order to
determine what the next stage in
its growth will he we must examine
the history of its growth through
the past and the conditions and
tendencies of its present stage.
Our whole modern civilization in
its existent forms, this age of steel
and steam and electricity, with all
its triumphs of applied science in

the creation of great labor-saving
machinery, in rapid transit and the
annihilation of distance and time,
is a wondrous growth, exceeding in
this one century in these particu
lars the sum total of all that pre
vious history has recorded. Hut
follow this marvelous shoot down
ward to the stem and we shall find
that it is after all a graft. "The
same," to use Professor William
Smith's figure, "The same was en
grafted upon the sturdy stem of the
olden culture, a stem that struck
its roots deep into the sacred soil
of Greece and Home, through the
rich accumulated alluvium of
nearly thirty centuries. Into this
graft, this new scion, the generous
sap of the ancient trunk has been
poured abundantly and a pro
digious growth and wonderful
fruitage have resulted."
The art of Greece has been the
inspiration, the wonder, and the
despair of all artists since the day
when the lofty spirit of Hellenic
greatness began to Hag. The
mythology of Greece lias become

the language of symbol among all
civilized peoples of whatever name
and tongue. The poetry, the phil
osophy, the ethics, and the science
as well as the arts of Greece,
illumine every modern classic
page. Says Alfred Baker, professor
of mathematics in Toronto: "If
we should ever think of a people —
a chosen people —who had a mes
sage and a revelation to the world,
that people was the ancient Greeks.
We owe them an incalculable debt
for our knowledge of art, literature,
and science, and of the three our
debt is perhaps greatest for their
legacy of science." Whether con
sciously or unconsciously, we build
upon foundations laid, or at least
after plans drawn, by the great
thinkers —poets, artists, philoso
phers, scientists —of the days when
man was, in both body and intel
lect, at bis best. Even this present
age of scientific education is but
continuing the work where Greece
left off, and without the pioneering
work done by the science of those
old days and without the literature
of Greece upon whose light some men
of science now see tit to turn their

backs, our own science would have
bmt forced to go back to the most
primitive conceptions of nature and
waste centuries in traveling the
roads which the classical thinkers
built through unbroken wilds and
trod for us. Others have labored
and we have entered into their
labors.
If, then, the impression left by
the Hellenic spirit upon our world
of art and letters has l>een so strong
and so abiding, what of our inher
itance of educational ideals from
the same source? And if the
disciple has not been greater than
the master in those expressions of
creative genius, has the master
been surpassed in the business of
educating men and training the
powers in them for the creation of
great ideas and great ideals?
Though ignorance may some
times sneer and "self-complacent
modernism" sometimes assail, yet
one need not be a mere praiser of
the times that are gone to assert
that that age saw, in at least some
strata of society, man at his high
est and best since his creation, both
mentally and physically. "The
theories of the seers stood the test
of application by the men of
deeds." (Butler.) And so it is
our right, and our duty as well to
ask how that condition was real
ized, and why we, with the example
of their successes and their failures
and with the addition of the spirit
that was introduced by way of
Bethlehem and Calvary, can not
attain to that and better than that
by the addition of the moral and
spiritual strength that is ours from
on high.
The problems that the young
Athenians of brains and power had
to face were not so very different
from those which confront the
young American. Their polity
was, as ours is called, a democracy
—a government of the people by
the people. Their youth must,
therefore, be fitted (and so must
ours) not only for good citizenship,
but for the highest duties of citi
zens who are also rulers. Was
their course of training for it dif
ferent from ours? Have we learned
from it all that we can apply with
advantage to our own conditions?
The feature of Athenian educa
tion that has been most overlooked
in the modern was the love of the
beautiful. This was the dominat
ing principle in education, and we
would do well not to leave the
Aesthetic sense longer in neglect.
Hellenic sanity —soundness of body
and of intellect and of all that is
produced by either —is proverbial.
And through it all must run the
golden thread of beauty. As they
developed their language to its
peerless beauty and expressiveness,
as Callicrates and Ictinus reared
their wondrous temples, as Phidias
and Praxiteles carved their statues
and Polygnotus and Apelles spread
their canvases with perfect beauty
and symmetry, so they trained the
intellect and the soul into beauty
and strength, and so they trained
the body with a view to the beauti
ful and strong; and everything
that could tend in the opposite
direction was strictly proscribed.
In general, our universities, high
schools or gymnasia, and common


PROFESSOR WALTER MILLER
schools have their prototypes in
the similar institutions of classical
Athens. The fundamental prin
ciples even of the kindergarten we
find clearly set forth in the Repub
lic of Plato and embodied in his
infant-school.
The aim of the public school was
to awaken the minds of the youth
and help them to find the place in
the world that each could fill
better than any other, and above
all to furnish that sesthetic culture
which all ages have considered
important and which some still
reckon the paramount object of
our higher education.
The theory that education, as
distinguished from special train
ing, should afford a broad general
culture and that this is best secured
by a study of "humanity," or the
"humanities," is older than Soc
rates, new as to-day. That it has
been a suitable foundation upon
which to build our own educational
systems is not too much to assert;
for it is safe to say that through
that method of education, rather
than in spite of it, men were pro
duced who were in real training of
mind, in mastery of principles and
knowledge of men, in capacity for
every form of mental effort, from
the most refined speculation to the
conduct of every day affairs of
state and of business, the most
perfectly educated people the world
has ever seen.
That sort of training aimed at
producing not professional athletes,
nor musicians, nor mathemati
cians, but men, men of thought and
of action, who should be capable
of taking front rank in whatever
special lines of activity their after
life might lead. Competition then
was no less keen than it is now;
only that man received first honors
then and eternal fame to come,
who in his day could do some one
thing better than any other man
in Athens. Xenophon,in his Edu
cation of Cyrus, brings out the
necessity they felt for trained
specialists when he says that "those
w r ho give up paying attention to
many things and devote themselves
to some one thing, they are sure to
be the best in their particular
line." But such specialization, as
his words clearly imply, was re
served until after breadth of culture
was secured.
After a preparation of this kind,
the young man might devote him
self with perfect freedom of choice
all but exclusively to some one de
partment of knowledge. To afford
this special training was the busi
ness of the university. For from
the day of Gorgias, Socrates, Plato,
Athens had taken her place as the
university city of the world; and
she maintained it (even against the
glitter of the Ptolemaic state uni
versity at Alexandria) until nar
row-minded despotism closed her
doors and smothered the fires of
knowledge, which could not die but
smouldered on beneath the ashes,
to be fanned again into living
flame with the revival of learning
in the sixteenth century. That
university had its departments of
art, science, economics, philosophy,
letters, and each great teacher was
a special department unto himself;
it was, thus constituted, a univer
sity in the truest sense of the word,
although not organized with a
board of trustees and a cast-iron
charter, a university built not of
bricks but of brains, not with
mortar but with men; and it
exerted an influence that not only
filled the world then, but has made
itself felt even until now and will
continue to be a power as long as
there are students to study.

From even this cursory sketch it
may be seen from what beginnings
all our modern systems of education
have grown. For the Greeks have
been the school-masters of the
nations ;is today is the school
master of tomorrow. When Rome
made the soil of Hellas a Roman
province but bowed in humble
submission before the power of her
captive's intellect and fell herself a
captive to Grecian arts and letters,
the Athenian education was bodily
transplanted to Italian soil. As
ime progressed, the martial vigor
of Rome became a part of the bone
and tissue of the imported culture
of the lower schools; but the uni
versity was still at Athens, though
rivalled for a time by Alexandria
and Rhodes.
Rome spread her power and her
language over all western Europe,
and the official Latin tongue be
came the first and the chief subject
of study in the schools as the only
means of social and political and
afterwards ecclesiastical advance
ment. On one ground or another,
if for nothing more than mere tra
dition, it has maintained ils place
as the first and most essential
element in educational systems
that still exist as models of all that
should be.
Barbarism and Christianity
joined hands to crush the old uni
versity centres and blot out Grecian
culture from the world. Their
success, while not absolute, was
only too complete. The extin
guishing of the light of letters left
the world in darkness and gloom
for centuries with only here and
there a flickering rush light of
logical, mystical, or ecclesiastical
subtleties. Such profound ques
tions as how many spirits could
stand together upon the point of a
cambric needle, or whether a spirit
could pass from one point to an
other without passing through the
intervening space, however absurd
and valueless they may appear,
nevertheless did serve to sharpen
men's wits and to make them
hunger and thirst after real ideas.
Whence should spring the fountain
for satisfying such thirst? Had
all possibility of real ideas van
ished from the earth? There had
been creators of ideals once; had
their products all vanished with
the departure of their culture and
their power? Through the dark
ages the capacity for ideas seems to
have died out in men. For the
world was asleep —asleep for a
thousand years of rest and re-crea
tion. In the twelfth century it
began to awake, and with the
Italian Renaissance the dead ca
pacity for ideas was reborn.
"There were many forces," says
Professor Shoup, "that worked to
gether to produce the Renaissance,
but in Italy, at least, the main
cause was the recovery and study
of the Greek and Latin classics,
aided by the ever-present object
lessons of the grandeur of Roman
architecture and the loveliness of
Greek sculpture."
Thus with the rebirth of the
Athenian spirit among men came
also the resurrection of the univer
sity idea. The mediaeval universi
ties had hitherto provided for law,
theology, and medicine. The new
movement, which saved the arts
and sciences of Greece and Rome,
now brought in the''humanities"
as the education of culture —the
philosophical faculty—and the way
was opened wide 'or the easy de
velopment of the modern univer
sity. "The culture of the classics
bad to be re-appropriated before
the movement of the modern mind
could begin." (Symonds.) It was

through them that came again the
spiritual freedom, the intellectual
culture, the powers of criticism,
of comparison, and of scientific re
search that make an ideal educa
tion possible in our own day. And
with all the advances of the "new
education" the humanities are still
the humanities, enriched by many
a wholesome increment. Amid all
the other agencies for culture they
still form the essential element to
that aesthetic culture which all
consider important and which some
consider paramount, though we all
recognize that the world has many
things to learn besides Greek and
Latin.
Out of this new shoot springing
up from the old olive stump of
intellectual Attica have branched
forth the various scions which are
our modern universities. The evo
lution of the university has been,
like evolution in the natural world,
a spiral now rising, again descend
ing upon itself, but gaining with
each new circle. And as in the
organic world old forms die and
new ones come in, not created out
of nothing, but simply transforma
tions of the old: so our modern
higher education is but the old
university ideal transformed or
transforming, but not yet glorified.
Nothing really new has been added
to the sap in the veins of the tree
of knowledge, for all the grafts
that hive been set upon it. The
kindergarten, the grammar school,
the college and the university, with
its science and letters, its co
education, its elective system and
its majors and minors—but no de
grees —are as old as Plato. Indeed,
so little has the university ideal
grown since the unrivalled intel
lectual genius of Athens at the
climax of her intellectual power
evolved it, that it may be (and
since this paragraph was penned,
has been) seriously questioned
whether there is any such thing as
the "new education." "There is
nothing new under the sun" is no
where more true or false than in
the intellectual world. Sir Henry
, Maine goes so far as to say that
"Except the blind forces of Nature,
nothing moves in this world which
is not Greek in its origin." There
have been many revivals of knowl
edge besides the Italian Renais
sance; within a few years zoology,
chemistry, and geology have all
been born again. How hard we
toil to advance knowledge by in
troducing some "new" institution,
discovering some new truth. Hut
truth is eternal; and when our dis
covery is made we find the real
meaning of the poet's words:
"Wer kan 11 was (Dummes, wer was)
Kluges denken
Das nicht die Vorweltschon gedacht?"
Through all the growth and de
velopment of both the old and the
new the purpose of the university
has been always the same: not for
learning things, but for learning
how to learn things; not for cram
ming the memory with facts and
dates, but for teaching how to ob
serve facts and to cultivate a sense
of their relativity and the spirit of
criticism; not merely for enriching
the understanding, but for the
creation of a new life, the awaken
ing of a higher, nobler, truly scien
tific spirit, the culture and develop
ment of the thinking mind.
Education is the leading of the
young up into the intellectual and
spiritual kingdom that is theirs by
right of inheritance.
Sometimes it has been forgotten
that this can not be gained through
force or by following mechanical
forms and rules; nor can it be
secured in any other atmosphere

than one of freedom, with all of its
privileges and all of its responsi
bilities. The ''winds of freedom"
also were let loose from the yEolian
cave, and only too often have they
been lashed and locked in again.
Now perfect intellectual freedom
is ours once more. The attainment
of the true ideal of education,
from the kindergarten to the acad
emy of scholars, is almost within
our grasp. Shall we in our day
realize the ideal? If so, there are
a few faults in our American edu
cation which must he eradicated,
and the whole system must he
brought into line with the general
upward trend.
In the first place, in order to
make the true ideal of American
education a reality and to secure
breadth of culture combined with
power in some special field, tlie
work of the lower schools must be
made more thorough and more
effective. Those of our secondary
schools whose avowed purpose is to
fit its pupils for college, and that,
too, for some particular college, are
by far the most satisfactory in their
results. But in general our chil
dren come out of the common
school with little interest in the
higher life, iittle feeling and less
power of expressing the feeling
they have. They have no more
yearning after culture and sym
metrical training and healthy
growth than has the rose-bush in
the garden. The same reform that
will put a new spirit into our sec
ondary schools to render them
more effective will necessarily bring
with it a more desirable saving of
time for securing in college the
breadth of culture needed for the
most effective specializing in some
one fieid of knowledge afterward.
Then, in the second place, we
need some real system of organic
connection between our various
schools. There should be no leaps
in the mental development any
more than there are in natural
growth; as it is, however, our pupils
must successfully make several
before they reach the blissful goal
of an academic degree. The sec
ondary school has no rational
connection with the primary de
partment on the one hand; and on
the other, while it does not pretend
itself to be the apex of any educa
tional system, it still has as an
institution no vital connection with
the higher seminaries of learning.
It has begun, to the no small detri
ment of the youth, to ape univer
stiv methods —encouragingchildren
in knickerbockers and short skirts
to pursue all their knowledge, sci
entific, literary, and historical, back
to its ultimate sources! And that,
before they, or even nine-tenths of
their teachers, know what an ulti
mate source is, or how to judge one
critically if they should happen to
stumble upon it! Nothing could
be further from the real purpose of
the high school than the production
of scholarship.
And as the secondary education
has not yet settled down into its
own proper sphere, so the university
has not been able to draw its own
differentiating line just where it
ought to be, and seems compelled
to teach high school subjects in
high school ways. There is as
little propriety in the university's
whipping bad English into shape
and drilling on the elements of
Latin or French or German as
there is in the high school's at
tempting to teach Roman history
from ''the sources."
When lines are properly drawn
and the desired organic connection
made, we may see a straight and
steady growth from infancy to
scholarship with an appreciable
saving of precious years now
wasted through lack of definite
purpose. Our secondary schools
will he an immediate continuation
of the primary; the high schuol
and the college will cease to overlap
each other; and the college or uni
versity will in its turn be a contin
uation of the high schuol as the
high school of the grammar school,
but necessarily something more;
not even this institution, however,
may be regarded as a factory for
turning out scholars; the under
graduate college will be a place
where, with the help of great
teachers, great libraries and lab
oratories, any student may find the
training that will give him culture
and strength. In the case of those
who have not already set their in
tellectual ambitions upon some
definite line of life work the culture
must be particularly broad that it
may find their peculiar talents out
and awaken their love for that
work which they are best adapted
to do. The university, as it is, is
not for the purpose of making
scholars, but for developing the
men and women out of whom
scholars, investigators, teachers,
statesmen, may be made. It is not
necessary, nor even desirable, that
all our masses should be scholars;
the best "out-living" is not likely
to be given by one whose time is
wholly spent over ancient manu
scripts or over a microscope. To
live a life of righteousness, to do no
wrong to any man, to master one's
own self, to serve God and one's
fellow-men —all that needs no
scholarly erudition. But no one's
culture — the upbuilding and
strengthening of all that is good in
him, wide range of intellect and
knowledge—can be too deep or too
broad. That may be called the
fundamental idea of our American
colleges and universities, and here
in may be found the highest boast
of our education, as it has been:
that without definite regard for a
learned profession, it affords the
possibility of an all-round train
ing, a broadening and elevating
culture for the common man,
widening his horizon and enabling
him to see truth and live truth.
Hut even with this it is evident
that our system is not, and never
has been, complete. We feel that
most when we follow up the differ
ent stages of the instructing body
as we have outlined the different
degrees of schools. Our teaching
can nowhere be better than the
teachers. Where are these trained?
Whence comes the great army of
teachers for our primary schools?
In general, from the secondary
schools. Whence the teachers of
the secondary schools? Nearly all
of them from the colleges and uni
versities. And where are the
teachers in the colleges and uni
versities trained? With few ex
ceptions, like most of our children's
doll's and hobby-horses, and for the
same reason, they bear the familiar
stamp, "Made in Germany." The
explanation is in either case the
same: Germany has the appli
ances for their production. Our
own want in this particular has
been felt ever since' the days of
Washington. The graduate de
partments appended to almost
every ambitious university in the
land are incontrovertible testimony
to the fact that in America we do
need and do want universities like
or superior to the German uni
versities. Academies of science, in
a feeble way, we already have.
The whole lower school is a great
mental gymnasium; everything is
aimed at training, developing; be

tween the master and the pupil
there is intellectually a great gulf;
for every exercise the master puts
the pupil through is to tne latter
dillicult, but to the former simple.
In the university this distance be
tween teacher and taught is less
ened. The student comes with
powers trained and his capacity
approximates more nearly that of
the instructor, while the latter is
for the same reason ready to meet
him more than half way. While
our college professors are perform
ing the double functions of in
vestigators and teachers they are
indeed doing their most teliing
personal work, the work that will
impress their personality most
imperishably upon the after world
and make themselves immortal;
but if their first and highest aim is
the advancement of their particular
science through their own personal
investigation, then every hour of
elementary instruction is a brake
upon the wheels of their power,
every hour's lecture that is made
to tit the needs of learners repre
sents so much time and energy
diverted from their proper channel.
We often hear of young men in
search of college positions who are
•'brilliant scholars," but dismal
failures as teachers. Their place
is not in the instructor's chair,
where their efforts at teaching will
be, both to themselves and to the
students, worse than wasted. If
they are investigators, our country
sh uld have a place for them, with
libraries, laboratories, and observa
tories, as well as for the teachers
who are scholars only less devoted
to the prosecution of research be
cause they have the spirit of teach
ing. The real investigator's best
will be attained only by giving
himself up absolutely to learning,
to pushing forward the outposts
of investigation and widening the
circuit of thought and knowledge
and never relaxing from the exer
tion of his highest power. These
are the men who can afford to
specialize in one small field of
science to the exclusion of every
thing else that is of interest to
humanity. Their work also is
essential to the advancement of the
race and to the growth of educa
tion; and the perfect educational
system must have a place for them
and for their work. One such
university our country already has
and will soon, we trust, have an
other —the National University—
to foster investigation and train
scholars, and so raise up the whole
standard of our national educa
tion. Thus, through the common
feature of instruction, the college
has its organic connection with the
high school; while it joins hands
with the higher universities through
the seminaries and laboratories
where the scholar that is to be is
trained in methods of independent
research and discovery of truth.
And when this idea 1 is consum
mated in our land; when those of
the colleges that can do so become
universities and those that can not
become universities fall naturally
into their places as training schools
for the real universities; then we
shall have a genuine system of edu
cation,and the National University
or Academy will be the pinnacle of
that system, rising as high above
our colleges as they above the
common schools.
The last defect to mention is the
most serious and will lie the most
difficult to correct, for it is the
most insidious and the most deeply
rooted. The curse of our edu a
tional spirit is "the tendency to look
upon education as a mere tool for
money-getting." Those who look

upon know ledge only from the stand
point of "practical" utility are likely
to seein the university only a bureau
for the delivery of special informa
tion, a mere warehouse for literary,
medical, or legal merchandise, in
stead of a temple of knowledge
and truth. The enrichment of
knowledge and power is not con
sidered and therefore not desired.
Too general is the conception in
our land that nothing is practical,
nothing is useful, even in matters
of pure intellect, unless it can be
translated into dollars and cents.
Art' we, brain and brawn, so wholly
enslaved to Mammon? Nay, can
it be denied that the same master
is enslaving, or has already en
slaved, even the intellectual pro
fessions —the bar, the bench, the
clinic, the chair, the studio, and
even the pulpit ? "Even where
science, art, and literature, the
things of the mind, are pursued
after a fashion, it is too often not
as an end, but as a means, not for
love, but to get rich or at least to
make a living." And for that very
reason it is usually "only after a
fashion' 1 that they are pursued.
To him who studies literature,
philosophy, or mathematics only as
a means to such an end, even
these pursuits of pure intellect are
as much a "bread and butter edu
cation" as law or medicine to him
who has no higher interest in his
science than financial advantage
to himself.
It is a matter for regret that
higher education has not more
frequently as its object disinterested
culture —the enriching and beauti
fying of the soul —but only the
practical, financial advantage of
the student. How few study Greek
and Latin and higher mathematics
any more just for the sake of know
ing them or as a means of calling
forth power, of cultivating taste
and character, right ambition, and
interest in great and high themes!
Is not the incentive to such studies
in these days rather a desire to
pass the examinations and get into
college, or, sometimes, to make a
living by teaching them, which is,
after all, only another way of
serving a selfish purpose? If they
could not be turned to immediate,
practical advantage, they would be
studied much less than they are.
In precisely the same way, most
students study physics or chemistry
not for the philosophic delight of
finding out the secrets of nature,
but solely to find through them a
means of livelihood, and, haply,
a certain advantage in the struggle
for wealth.
With all these faults and virtues
in view 1 come today to plead not
alone for the old education of
proper morals, polished manners,
elegant speech, nor yet for the new
education of exclusive science, but
for a proper balance between the
old and the new —the culture of
the humanities and of nature as a
basis for later specialization; and
for the concentration of all one's
ability afterward on some one por
tion of the vast lield of science and
knowledge. The principle upon
which the whole plea is based is
that true education must, have
three dimensions, length, breadth
and depth. Of these breadth must
be provided for in the undergradu
ate college course; the opportunity
will never come again, and can
never come again. Depth can
be added only in the special
training of the graduate university
and after study. Length is a rel
ative dimension depending upon
the length and intensity of life.
Hut all three must begin together.
The danger against which this

warning signal is raised is that
'specialization before breadth is
attained will prove to be not power
and culture, but weakness and nar
rowness. . . . It will be the Same,
whatever the line of premature
specialization. Exclusive devotion
from the beginning to the arts and
letters is ruinous to our best devel
opment, even though that has been
the proved and approved higher
education of the last four hundred
years. . . . And yet by confining
ourselves to such a course we come
to live so much in the realm of the
ideal that we ignore or forget the
real things around us. The great
literatures of the world are not our
only source of truth, nor the only
scene of beauty, nor the only
means of culture. The whole busi
ness of any man is to know and to
live the truth. He must have eyes
that will see truth wherever it may
be fmnd; and there are even
clearer, surer revelations of truth
in (Jod's world around us than in
the world of letters.
We must not fail to recognize
that there are some intellectual
constitutions which utterly refuse
to assimilate culture from scientific
study. So much the worse for
them, in like manner there are
many minds wholly unsusceptible
to the charms of classical poetry.
The more the pity for that. People
thus constituted will have to make
the best they can of a one-sided
culture; if they will only do the
best they can, their culture, for
which the university makes provi
sion, will not have been secured in
vain.
We are all in sympathy with
Professor Virchow'sdefinition: that
the aim of university study is gen
eral scientific and moral culture
together with the mastery of one
special department of study. We
have here at this university a prac
tical plan which has in itself all
the requisite qualities for realizing
the ideal condition of tilings. No
lixed curriculum or system of re
quired studies leading up to a de
gree can furnish to any number of
different minds the culture which
each one needs. Here the student
must have bis own central pur
pose, and it must be an earnest
purpose; toward that, as a central
axis of his life, all other radiating
lines must point. Whether these
radiating lines of light shall be
focused in all their intensity on
one single point, or illumine all
bis path through life and brighten
and help all who cross it there,
depends mainly on the individual
student's aims, but partly also on
him to whom that student looks
for special counsel.
At any rate, narrow specializing
should not begin until the student's
mind is thoroughly disciplined.
Whether that discipline is best
secured in the old-fashioned way
with Latin, Greek, and mathe
matics is a question which has two
good sides for debate. "There is,"
to quote from our President, "much
to be said in favor of the college in
which discipline pure and simple is
made the chief end of all the work.
In such a school those subjects —
languages, sciences, and philosophy
—which serve the ends of training
best, should be taught, and such
subjects only."
When we consider the two great
new principles of our age —the
conservation of energy with all the
wonders it has made possible in
the material world, and biological
evolution with all the marvels it
will produce in not only the phys
ical, but also the intellectual and
| spiritual well-being of the race —
the irresistible attractiveness of the
new education, the triumph of the
scientific education over iill compe
tition, and the preponderating
tendency of students of "practical"
minds to confine themselves to the
scientific education, are easily com
prehended. The educational pen
dulum has been steadily swinging
backward and forward ever since
modern education in the fifteenth
century began, first to one extreme,
and then to the other, as if no
middle ground were possible. Uni
versities were new things when the
Renaissance came. They had
been founded for "practical" pur
poses; and to the devotees of the
"practical" courses the introduction
of the classics was an innovation,
and the new learning was frowned
upon. The humanists of the Refor
mation period had a battle to fight
against tremendous odds. In order
to maintain any place at all, they
had to prove that literature was
delightful for its own sake, and
that Greece and Rome had some
thing worth while to teach to mod
ern men. The struggle was soon
over; the pendulum began to swing
ihe other way; the new learning
triumphed throughout all Europe;
and from the revival of learning
down almost to within the memory
of men still living, any education
without a good strong backbone of
Greek and Latin classics was no
education. Education meant clas
sical education. Hut human nature
rebels against extreme?, and as
surely as extremes prevail, so surely
will come reaction against them.
Thus again after the middle of the
last century, when new life caught
on the souls of men, and lifted
them out of the social and political
corruption of the times, when the
Encyclopedists, as the precursors of
the great Revolution, began the
revolution in the realms of science,
then again came the flight to
antiquity as the only source from
which to gain afresh the elements
of intellectual and artistic life. To
those great crises in civilization, to
those accomplishments of a race
of intellectual giants, humanity
returns again and again as to a
fountain of spiritual youth eternally
fresh and strong.
It is as strange now to reflect
that to the foolish conservatives of
four hundred years ago the classics
were an intolerable innovation, as
it is to think that Huxley and his
compeers had to contend so long
and so hard for the claims of sci
ence to recognition as a force for
culture in a modern education.
And now that the educational
sceptre has passed from classics to
science, and the scientific spirit
dominates every sphere, its more
radical advocates would crowd
entirely out of the field its most
formidable rival, the time-honored
humanistic culture, as having no
place whatever in an up-to-date
education. The pendulum hits
once more swung as far as it can
go. That spirit of science which
is intolerant, whether it is philo
logical science that inveighs against
natural science or natural science
that will allow no place to philo
logical science, is the primal cause
of the violent reactions that come
in the lines of education; that
readiness for revulsion is one of
the things that argue most potently
for the final triumph of breadth.
Intolerance is the child of narrow
ness of spirit; and when we all
dwell together in harmony, each
recognizing the value of all lines
of culture, breadth is assured.
And if Mr. King is right in
his estimate of the purely scientific
mind unbalanced by those mental

pursuits that feed the fancy, en
noble the sentiments, enable us to
enjoy beauty and harmony —and
the ardent advocate of the human
ities is easily persuaded to believe
him —then there is sure to come
against the technical scientific
education so fashionable in our
day a reaction strong enough to
bring about a tremendous revival
of the humanities, in the most
comprehensive sense of the word;
or, if a compromise can be effected,
it may at last stop the swinging
pendulum in'the middle and pro
duce the harmonious blending of
the two cultures that will give us
the full liberal education for which
this plea is made.
With a well-balanced education,
that antiquated narrow contempt
of the new education for the old
will he entirely forgotten. Then
in the eyes of the scientist the
humanist will 110 longer be a man
who can not '"see beyond the horizon
of his own shallow experience, and
who from his self-constructed
throne judges the rest of mankind
with the complacent assurance born
of a fancied superiority." Nor will
the humanist find in this promised
land so many Philistines —"full of
narrowness, full of prejudices, with
a defective type of religion, a nar
row range of intellect and knowl
edge, a stunted sense of beauty, a
low standard of manners, arid
averse, moreover, to whatever may
disturb it in its vulgarity " With
this breadth of intellectual culture,
and the physical culture that our
human nature demands and de
serves, our youth may with joy
enter into their six-fold inher
itance, physical, scientific, literary,
aesthetic, political, and religious,
which is their indisputable birth
right; and thus equipped they may
transmit it preserved and, in some
chosen field, enriched, to genera
tions yet to come. Lame, at least,
is the institution of learning that
withholds from its students any
one of the six.
The world's call is for the man
of learning who knows better than
any one elst how to do some one
thing; but he cannot meet the re
quirements if he knows nothing
but that one thing; he must know
it in its relation to other things; he
must see things in their proper
proportion. "What science and
practical life alike need," says
Professor Butler, "is not narrow
men, but broad men sharpened to a
point."
Let our new education be not a
vertical line, but a pyramid, of
which our present undergraduate
courses shall furnish the base large
and broad and solid; and let the
university of the future, and, until
it is realized, the graduate depart
ments of the present, supply the
apex. It may cost many a reluc
tant sacrifice of intellectual plea
sures as the narrowing process
begins and many more as it con
tinues. It may be painful, but it
is necessary. For in this day of
specialization only the specialist
can work out the best that is in
him and render back to society
what it has done for him. The
first law of the fullest perfection
says: He perfect; that is, cultivate
all your powers completely and
uniformly—as far as possible. And
the second law is like unto it:
Forward in some respect the per
fection of the race, which has made
your culture possible. And both
may lie included in the law of all
study: Learn only that you may
yourself create. For only through
this divine power of creation is any
one really man; without it he is
only a tolerably clever machine.

It is the business of every scholar
to do something to extend the
domains of knowledge in at least
some one direction, lie can not
afford all his life long to cultivate
nature and knowledge 011 all sides;
one life would never sullice even
to acquire a knowledge of what
the past has done in many depart
ments of thought and what is yet
to be done; and so that life and
its powers would be lost to the
world to which they should have
been consecrate. To some it may
lie painful to think that we must
live on and die and leave many a
wide field of knowledge untraversed
and unknown. This longing to
learn everything is in itself a noble
element of our nature, and leads to
noble results; but it requires to be
checked by the stern voice of duty.
Otherwise we should be living to
self—living off the world's bounty.
The world owes no man anything;
but every man owes the world all
that he has and is, for the growth
of the past has made the possibili
ties of the present. No one has a
right to labor for his own enjoy
ment merely or keep bis education
for his own gratification. Every
true scholar, therefore, must, ac
cording to taste or natural capacity
or previous training, make his
choice of that side of his nature to
which he will give the preference,
and, after the foundation of the
pyramid of his education has been
laid broad and strong, rear the
superstructure, narrowing as it
aspires, llis own culture in its
other departments must be left to
take care of itself. Therein con
sists the higher sacrifice. And the
more useful the scholar's life is to
be, the higher wili be the sacrifice
he must make, and the more he
will have to surrender of that very
culture without which his genius
would have been unstable and
helpless. He lias no choice in the
matter. He must turn his back
upon many an avenue for self
culture opened up to him by nature
in order to devote ail his natural
gifts and all his acquired powers
to the superior development of one
or more capacities.
But for a student to specialize on
one line too early in his career is
to deprive himself of the half of his
soul and shut himself up too early to
a trade. That is technical training,
not education. If professional
training is a benefit, it is so in
greater or less degree according to
the measure of the culture and at
tainment which one brings to such
study. Ail professional training,
all specializing, if it is going 10
accomplish that which is best in
its own sphere, must he built up
like our pyramid, step by step,
upon the foundations of a culture
br ad and deep. And the higher
we build the pyramid of special
knowledge, the broader and deeper
must its foundations have been
laid aid the more carefully must
these have been calculated for that
special superstructure they are to
bear. This is the realm of the
human mind. Without that, law,
medicine, or any other profession
is practically helpless. We can
not take hoys from 1 lie byways and
hedges, teach them to read and
write and do simple sums, then
give them a two or three years'
course in a medical school and ex
pect them to do much for the last
ing betterment of the human race.
Here and there one or two may,
through chance or through some
God-given talent, help somewhat
to that end, but we have no reason
to expect that with the preparation
they have had they will succeed in
doing so. We force into every

profession boys (and girls) from
our lower schools with minds ab
solutely untrained and utterly in
capable of living up to the best
they might, if it were not for our
American weakness of being for
ever in a rush. Our colleges have
made provision for meeting just
this difficulty, but in our overhaste
to get into the struggle for exist
ence that provision is ignored. If
there is any one thing which more
than another distinguishes our
American university from other
universities it is this: that whereas
the German university exists for
the production of scholars, in
vestigators, and the English uni
versity for the production of
clergymen and the polish of young
noblemen, the American university
exists primarily for purposes of
culture —the culture of the common
man. The question of usefulness
or of "practical" value in this
culture stage of higher education is
now, we may happily say, among
educated men but very seldom
raised; or if it is raised, it is only
for the purpose of putting it down
the more effectually. In the pro
duction of culture everything de
pends upon truth; practical utility
(in the vulgar sense) is altogether
a secondary matter, in the truer
sense of the word, anything is
practical that makes a man or a
community or a state or a nation
stronger or better or wiser, any
thing that helps a man to live up
to the best that is in him, to be
true to himself, to bis neighbor,
and to bis God. That is practical
and nothing else is, except as it is
wrought through such a medium.
The scholar's work may bring him
in his daily bread, yes, even
wealth. But that is only inci
dental; it is not the most real nor
the noblest function of his work,
nor even the most practical.
But whatever your education, it
must be returned with proper in
crease tc> the world that gave it to
you. Of what use to your college
or your country or this world, to
whose betterment your best should
be consecrated —of what use to any
body or anything but yourself, is
your education if you become not
the leaders of thought and the
teachers of those who follow to
make up the forces that make for
righteousness and the advancement
of truth? Your first calling is that
you be witnesses of the Truth.
Every scholar, every educated man,
to live out the best of which he is
capable, must be the "living spirit
of knowledge"; he ought to be
morally the best man of his age,
and he must in some way or other
be a teacher, whatever bis other
profession or professions in life;
and "they that be teachers shall
shine as the brightness of the firm
ament, and they that turn many
to righteousaess as the stars for
ever and ever.''
You that have attained so much
of the skill required to overcome
and correct the improper tendencies
of the natural man, to combat
ignorance and vice and build up in
their place knowledge and right
eousness; you that have acquired
so much of culture that you are
ready to be sent forth into the
world to do —to teach and to bless
—remember always that you are
destined to act and react with a
most powerful influence upon hu
manity. Whether the circle of
your influence be wide or narrow,
the culture you have received is to
be extended to others and every
where to lift up our common
brotherhood to a higher plane of
living.
We have made it our highest
aim to contribute to the culture
and elevation of humanity in you
and in all with whom you may
ever have a common point of con
tact. All knowledge and all sci
ence that we may command, which
does not tend to that end, is vain
and worthless. How successful it
shall be in attaining that end has
depended upon the spirit in which
you have received what has been
afforded here and will depend also
upon the spirit and faithfulness
with which you carry further the
lessons of truth you have learned
and upon the increase and trans
mission of the power you have
made your own. You go forth
believing in the ultimate triumph
of the good, with your ideals of
what humanity ought to be; is
humanity up to your ideal? If
not, then you can not be true to
yourself, to your neighbor, or to
your God, if you fail to devote all
your best powers, your best self, to
the elevation of the humanity you
find about you up to the ideals you
cherish for yourselves.
You have your life problems to
face, not alone tbese literary, in
tellectual, and educational prob
lems the proper solution of which
will raise us above the present
''hopeful level of Philistine vulgar
ity" which we are accused of occu
pying, and make us to be leaders
ot the world in things of pure in
tellect as well as in lines of
mechanical application of scientific
principles; that is yours to bring
about; but you have also just
as serious social, economic, and
political problems, and the world
looks to you to solve them. The
questions of finance must be
answered by college men; the rela
tion of capital to labor, the question
of trusts, of marriage and divorce,
and of the reform of municipal
government, the annihilation of
that worst enemy of education and
morals, that legalized destroyer of
men and property —the saloon—
these are grave problems which
call for the application of the best
minds and strongest characters our
colleges can develop.
"The old order changeth, yielding place
to new,
And God fulfills Himself in many ways,
Lest one good custom should corrupt t he
world."
The land in which we live is
called "the New World," and our
individual lot is cast in the newest
part of it. The problems, educa
tional as well as political, which
our country has had to face are,
many of them, new. We have
grown up, as far as we have grown
at all, under the stimulus of condi
tions all our own. We have been
bound by no distant past nor
necessarily hampered by the tradi
tions of the lands from which our
fathers came. Most of our short
national life has so far been an
experiment. What the experiment
will prove will he known when our
young western world has grown to
age. In the meantime all the
civilized world is watching with
eager eyes each new stage of our
experimenting. In our present
state we are generally accused of
being a nation of mediocrity, except
in bulk. One century has seen us
suddenly transformed from three
million subject colonists on the
Atlantic sea-board into a nation of
sixty million sovereign citizens
whose dominions reach from ocean
to ocean. Similarly our culture is
full grown hut immature, like a
boy of sixteen six feet tall. The
like of our system (or want of sys
tem) of education was never seen
nor ever dreamed of before. Our
grammar school may find its
counterpart in the old world; but
our American high school is
neither the English grammar
school nor the German gymnasium
nor the French Lycee. Our Amer
ican college may he the outgrowth
of the Oxford and Cambridge idea
further developed, but the Amer
ican university is not the Englisl
university nor the German univer
sity. It is a mixed product grown
up under new conditions on new
soil.
Europe makes merry over our
481 colleges and universities and
wonders how they all manage to
exist. Never mind Europe; we do
the same ourselves. Hut our col
leges which we count by hundreds
are a necessary link in the evolu
tion of a coming educational system
worthy of our western civilization;
for as they are, they represent and
foster the spirit of our national
life. Every nation must in her
own way show that she has abiding
in her the love of truth; and that
love can best be cherished only in
ways that conform to her own
character and promise the fulfill
ment of her own purposes. In the
development to which we look for
ward, who can say that we have
too many colleges now? They will
rather be found too few. There is
scarcely a community in the length
and breadth of our land that would
not gladly make large sacrifices to
secure in its midst the location of a
promising college and so increase
the present list. When the ideal
of the American university is real
ized and the college of to-day falls
into its natural place as a school of

culture and of preparation for the
higher university of tomorrow, we
shall find that we have after all
too few rather than too many col
leges. Such a result Would be hut
another of history's repetitions.
For the first twelve years of higher
education in Michigan, when uni
versities did not mean much more
in the way of education than high
schools do now, that commonwealth
had no less than nine state colleges.
They all struggled along at starva
tion rates. Hut they were far from
being a menace to society or a
danger to education. For as one
of the nine grew into a university,
the other eight, as was right and
best, fell into their natural place as
preparatory schools of a high order
feeders for the one real univer
sity. And today we regret only
that there had not been more of
those "starveling" colleges to follow
the same course. Now that ideals
have grown upward and expanded,
the same development may take
place to our well-being on the pres
ent higher plane. Our college cur-

riculum lias undergone wondrous
changes in the last '200 years; the
garment that was placed upon the
American college in its infancy has
heen long since outgrown, and the
patterns after which it was cut are
no longer in fashion. The oldest
of our colleges is, in comparison
with Paris and Oxford, as far as
years are concerned, still in its
childhood. And who knows hut
the spirit that planted these 4<Sl
colleges will yet realize its fulfill
ment in the "true idea of a univer
sity''? What will that consumma
tion be?
Our present system (if what we
have may fairly he called a system)
is a development, with the various
additions and other changes that
come with growth, out of the edu
cation of past ages. In order to
determine what the next stage in
its growth will he we must examine
the history of its growth through
the past and the conditions and
tendencies of its present stage.
Our whole modern civilization in
its existent forms, this age of steel
and steam and electricity, with all
its triumphs of applied science in

the creation of great labor-saving
machinery, in rapid transit and the
annihilation of distance and time,
is a wondrous growth, exceeding in
this one century in these particu
lars the sum total of all that pre
vious history has recorded. Hut
follow this marvelous shoot down
ward to the stem and we shall find
that it is after all a graft. "The
same," to use Professor William
Smith's figure, "The same was en
grafted upon the sturdy stem of the
olden culture, a stem that struck
its roots deep into the sacred soil
of Greece and Home, through the
rich accumulated alluvium of
nearly thirty centuries. Into this
graft, this new scion, the generous
sap of the ancient trunk has been
poured abundantly and a pro
digious growth and wonderful
fruitage have resulted."
The art of Greece has been the
inspiration, the wonder, and the
despair of all artists since the day
when the lofty spirit of Hellenic
greatness began to Hag. The
mythology of Greece lias become

the language of symbol among all
civilized peoples of whatever name
and tongue. The poetry, the phil
osophy, the ethics, and the science
as well as the arts of Greece,
illumine every modern classic
page. Says Alfred Baker, professor
of mathematics in Toronto: "If
we should ever think of a people —
a chosen people —who had a mes
sage and a revelation to the world,
that people was the ancient Greeks.
We owe them an incalculable debt
for our knowledge of art, literature,
and science, and of the three our
debt is perhaps greatest for their
legacy of science." Whether con
sciously or unconsciously, we build
upon foundations laid, or at least
after plans drawn, by the great
thinkers —poets, artists, philoso
phers, scientists —of the days when
man was, in both body and intel
lect, at bis best. Even this present
age of scientific education is but
continuing the work where Greece
left off, and without the pioneering
work done by the science of those
old days and without the literature
of Greece upon whose light some men
of science now see tit to turn their

backs, our own science would have
bmt forced to go back to the most
primitive conceptions of nature and
waste centuries in traveling the
roads which the classical thinkers
built through unbroken wilds and
trod for us. Others have labored
and we have entered into their
labors.
If, then, the impression left by
the Hellenic spirit upon our world
of art and letters has l>een so strong
and so abiding, what of our inher
itance of educational ideals from
the same source? And if the
disciple has not been greater than
the master in those expressions of
creative genius, has the master
been surpassed in the business of
educating men and training the
powers in them for the creation of
great ideas and great ideals?
Though ignorance may some
times sneer and "self-complacent
modernism" sometimes assail, yet
one need not be a mere praiser of
the times that are gone to assert
that that age saw, in at least some
strata of society, man at his high
est and best since his creation, both
mentally and physically. "The
theories of the seers stood the test
of application by the men of
deeds." (Butler.) And so it is
our right, and our duty as well to
ask how that condition was real
ized, and why we, with the example
of their successes and their failures
and with the addition of the spirit
that was introduced by way of
Bethlehem and Calvary, can not
attain to that and better than that
by the addition of the moral and
spiritual strength that is ours from
on high.
The problems that the young
Athenians of brains and power had
to face were not so very different
from those which confront the
young American. Their polity
was, as ours is called, a democracy
—a government of the people by
the people. Their youth must,
therefore, be fitted (and so must
ours) not only for good citizenship,
but for the highest duties of citi
zens who are also rulers. Was
their course of training for it dif
ferent from ours? Have we learned
from it all that we can apply with
advantage to our own conditions?
The feature of Athenian educa
tion that has been most overlooked
in the modern was the love of the
beautiful. This was the dominat
ing principle in education, and we
would do well not to leave the
Aesthetic sense longer in neglect.
Hellenic sanity —soundness of body
and of intellect and of all that is
produced by either —is proverbial.
And through it all must run the
golden thread of beauty. As they
developed their language to its
peerless beauty and expressiveness,
as Callicrates and Ictinus reared
their wondrous temples, as Phidias
and Praxiteles carved their statues
and Polygnotus and Apelles spread
their canvases with perfect beauty
and symmetry, so they trained the
intellect and the soul into beauty
and strength, and so they trained
the body with a view to the beauti
ful and strong; and everything
that could tend in the opposite
direction was strictly proscribed.
In general, our universities, high
schools or gymnasia, and common


PROFESSOR WALTER MILLER
schools have their prototypes in
the similar institutions of classical
Athens. The fundamental prin
ciples even of the kindergarten we
find clearly set forth in the Repub
lic of Plato and embodied in his
infant-school.
The aim of the public school was
to awaken the minds of the youth
and help them to find the place in
the world that each could fill
better than any other, and above
all to furnish that sesthetic culture
which all ages have considered
important and which some still
reckon the paramount object of
our higher education.
The theory that education, as
distinguished from special train
ing, should afford a broad general
culture and that this is best secured
by a study of "humanity," or the
"humanities," is older than Soc
rates, new as to-day. That it has
been a suitable foundation upon
which to build our own educational
systems is not too much to assert;
for it is safe to say that through
that method of education, rather
than in spite of it, men were pro
duced who were in real training of
mind, in mastery of principles and
knowledge of men, in capacity for
every form of mental effort, from
the most refined speculation to the
conduct of every day affairs of
state and of business, the most
perfectly educated people the world
has ever seen.
That sort of training aimed at
producing not professional athletes,
nor musicians, nor mathemati
cians, but men, men of thought and
of action, who should be capable
of taking front rank in whatever
special lines of activity their after
life might lead. Competition then
was no less keen than it is now;
only that man received first honors
then and eternal fame to come,
who in his day could do some one
thing better than any other man
in Athens. Xenophon,in his Edu
cation of Cyrus, brings out the
necessity they felt for trained
specialists when he says that "those
w r ho give up paying attention to
many things and devote themselves
to some one thing, they are sure to
be the best in their particular
line." But such specialization, as
his words clearly imply, was re
served until after breadth of culture
was secured.
After a preparation of this kind,
the young man might devote him
self with perfect freedom of choice
all but exclusively to some one de
partment of knowledge. To afford
this special training was the busi
ness of the university. For from
the day of Gorgias, Socrates, Plato,
Athens had taken her place as the
university city of the world; and
she maintained it (even against the
glitter of the Ptolemaic state uni
versity at Alexandria) until nar
row-minded despotism closed her
doors and smothered the fires of
knowledge, which could not die but
smouldered on beneath the ashes,
to be fanned again into living
flame with the revival of learning
in the sixteenth century. That
university had its departments of
art, science, economics, philosophy,
letters, and each great teacher was
a special department unto himself;
it was, thus constituted, a univer
sity in the truest sense of the word,
although not organized with a
board of trustees and a cast-iron
charter, a university built not of
bricks but of brains, not with
mortar but with men; and it
exerted an influence that not only
filled the world then, but has made
itself felt even until now and will
continue to be a power as long as
there are students to study.

From even this cursory sketch it
may be seen from what beginnings
all our modern systems of education
have grown. For the Greeks have
been the school-masters of the
nations ;is today is the school
master of tomorrow. When Rome
made the soil of Hellas a Roman
province but bowed in humble
submission before the power of her
captive's intellect and fell herself a
captive to Grecian arts and letters,
the Athenian education was bodily
transplanted to Italian soil. As
ime progressed, the martial vigor
of Rome became a part of the bone
and tissue of the imported culture
of the lower schools; but the uni
versity was still at Athens, though
rivalled for a time by Alexandria
and Rhodes.
Rome spread her power and her
language over all western Europe,
and the official Latin tongue be
came the first and the chief subject
of study in the schools as the only
means of social and political and
afterwards ecclesiastical advance
ment. On one ground or another,
if for nothing more than mere tra
dition, it has maintained ils place
as the first and most essential
element in educational systems
that still exist as models of all that
should be.
Barbarism and Christianity
joined hands to crush the old uni
versity centres and blot out Grecian
culture from the world. Their
success, while not absolute, was
only too complete. The extin
guishing of the light of letters left
the world in darkness and gloom
for centuries with only here and
there a flickering rush light of
logical, mystical, or ecclesiastical
subtleties. Such profound ques
tions as how many spirits could
stand together upon the point of a
cambric needle, or whether a spirit
could pass from one point to an
other without passing through the
intervening space, however absurd
and valueless they may appear,
nevertheless did serve to sharpen
men's wits and to make them
hunger and thirst after real ideas.
Whence should spring the fountain
for satisfying such thirst? Had
all possibility of real ideas van
ished from the earth? There had
been creators of ideals once; had
their products all vanished with
the departure of their culture and
their power? Through the dark
ages the capacity for ideas seems to
have died out in men. For the
world was asleep —asleep for a
thousand years of rest and re-crea
tion. In the twelfth century it
began to awake, and with the
Italian Renaissance the dead ca
pacity for ideas was reborn.
"There were many forces," says
Professor Shoup, "that worked to
gether to produce the Renaissance,
but in Italy, at least, the main
cause was the recovery and study
of the Greek and Latin classics,
aided by the ever-present object
lessons of the grandeur of Roman
architecture and the loveliness of
Greek sculpture."
Thus with the rebirth of the
Athenian spirit among men came
also the resurrection of the univer
sity idea. The mediaeval universi
ties had hitherto provided for law,
theology, and medicine. The new
movement, which saved the arts
and sciences of Greece and Rome,
now brought in the''humanities"
as the education of culture —the
philosophical faculty—and the way
was opened wide 'or the easy de
velopment of the modern univer
sity. "The culture of the classics
bad to be re-appropriated before
the movement of the modern mind
could begin." (Symonds.) It was

through them that came again the
spiritual freedom, the intellectual
culture, the powers of criticism,
of comparison, and of scientific re
search that make an ideal educa
tion possible in our own day. And
with all the advances of the "new
education" the humanities are still
the humanities, enriched by many
a wholesome increment. Amid all
the other agencies for culture they
still form the essential element to
that aesthetic culture which all
consider important and which some
consider paramount, though we all
recognize that the world has many
things to learn besides Greek and
Latin.
Out of this new shoot springing
up from the old olive stump of
intellectual Attica have branched
forth the various scions which are
our modern universities. The evo
lution of the university has been,
like evolution in the natural world,
a spiral now rising, again descend
ing upon itself, but gaining with
each new circle. And as in the
organic world old forms die and
new ones come in, not created out
of nothing, but simply transforma
tions of the old: so our modern
higher education is but the old
university ideal transformed or
transforming, but not yet glorified.
Nothing really new has been added
to the sap in the veins of the tree
of knowledge, for all the grafts
that hive been set upon it. The
kindergarten, the grammar school,
the college and the university, with
its science and letters, its co
education, its elective system and
its majors and minors—but no de
grees —are as old as Plato. Indeed,
so little has the university ideal
grown since the unrivalled intel
lectual genius of Athens at the
climax of her intellectual power
evolved it, that it may be (and
since this paragraph was penned,
has been) seriously questioned
whether there is any such thing as
the "new education." "There is
nothing new under the sun" is no
where more true or false than in
the intellectual world. Sir Henry
, Maine goes so far as to say that
"Except the blind forces of Nature,
nothing moves in this world which
is not Greek in its origin." There
have been many revivals of knowl
edge besides the Italian Renais
sance; within a few years zoology,
chemistry, and geology have all
been born again. How hard we
toil to advance knowledge by in
troducing some "new" institution,
discovering some new truth. Hut
truth is eternal; and when our dis
covery is made we find the real
meaning of the poet's words:
"Wer kan 11 was (Dummes, wer was)
Kluges denken
Das nicht die Vorweltschon gedacht?"
Through all the growth and de
velopment of both the old and the
new the purpose of the university
has been always the same: not for
learning things, but for learning
how to learn things; not for cram
ming the memory with facts and
dates, but for teaching how to ob
serve facts and to cultivate a sense
of their relativity and the spirit of
criticism; not merely for enriching
the understanding, but for the
creation of a new life, the awaken
ing of a higher, nobler, truly scien
tific spirit, the culture and develop
ment of the thinking mind.
Education is the leading of the
young up into the intellectual and
spiritual kingdom that is theirs by
right of inheritance.
Sometimes it has been forgotten
that this can not be gained through
force or by following mechanical
forms and rules; nor can it be
secured in any other atmosphere

than one of freedom, with all of its
privileges and all of its responsi
bilities. The ''winds of freedom"
also were let loose from the yEolian
cave, and only too often have they
been lashed and locked in again.
Now perfect intellectual freedom
is ours once more. The attainment
of the true ideal of education,
from the kindergarten to the acad
emy of scholars, is almost within
our grasp. Shall we in our day
realize the ideal? If so, there are
a few faults in our American edu
cation which must he eradicated,
and the whole system must he
brought into line with the general
upward trend.
In the first place, in order to
make the true ideal of American
education a reality and to secure
breadth of culture combined with
power in some special field, tlie
work of the lower schools must be
made more thorough and more
effective. Those of our secondary
schools whose avowed purpose is to
fit its pupils for college, and that,
too, for some particular college, are
by far the most satisfactory in their
results. But in general our chil
dren come out of the common
school with little interest in the
higher life, iittle feeling and less
power of expressing the feeling
they have. They have no more
yearning after culture and sym
metrical training and healthy
growth than has the rose-bush in
the garden. The same reform that
will put a new spirit into our sec
ondary schools to render them
more effective will necessarily bring
with it a more desirable saving of
time for securing in college the
breadth of culture needed for the
most effective specializing in some
one fieid of knowledge afterward.
Then, in the second place, we
need some real system of organic
connection between our various
schools. There should be no leaps
in the mental development any
more than there are in natural
growth; as it is, however, our pupils
must successfully make several
before they reach the blissful goal
of an academic degree. The sec
ondary school has no rational
connection with the primary de
partment on the one hand; and on
the other, while it does not pretend
itself to be the apex of any educa
tional system, it still has as an
institution no vital connection with
the higher seminaries of learning.
It has begun, to the no small detri
ment of the youth, to ape univer
stiv methods —encouragingchildren
in knickerbockers and short skirts
to pursue all their knowledge, sci
entific, literary, and historical, back
to its ultimate sources! And that,
before they, or even nine-tenths of
their teachers, know what an ulti
mate source is, or how to judge one
critically if they should happen to
stumble upon it! Nothing could
be further from the real purpose of
the high school than the production
of scholarship.
And as the secondary education
has not yet settled down into its
own proper sphere, so the university
has not been able to draw its own
differentiating line just where it
ought to be, and seems compelled
to teach high school subjects in
high school ways. There is as
little propriety in the university's
whipping bad English into shape
and drilling on the elements of
Latin or French or German as
there is in the high school's at
tempting to teach Roman history
from ''the sources."
When lines are properly drawn
and the desired organic connection
made, we may see a straight and
steady growth from infancy to
scholarship with an appreciable
saving of precious years now
wasted through lack of definite
purpose. Our secondary schools
will he an immediate continuation
of the primary; the high schuol
and the college will cease to overlap
each other; and the college or uni
versity will in its turn be a contin
uation of the high schuol as the
high school of the grammar school,
but necessarily something more;
not even this institution, however,
may be regarded as a factory for
turning out scholars; the under
graduate college will be a place
where, with the help of great
teachers, great libraries and lab
oratories, any student may find the
training that will give him culture
and strength. In the case of those
who have not already set their in
tellectual ambitions upon some
definite line of life work the culture
must be particularly broad that it
may find their peculiar talents out
and awaken their love for that
work which they are best adapted
to do. The university, as it is, is
not for the purpose of making
scholars, but for developing the
men and women out of whom
scholars, investigators, teachers,
statesmen, may be made. It is not
necessary, nor even desirable, that
all our masses should be scholars;
the best "out-living" is not likely
to be given by one whose time is
wholly spent over ancient manu
scripts or over a microscope. To
live a life of righteousness, to do no
wrong to any man, to master one's
own self, to serve God and one's
fellow-men —all that needs no
scholarly erudition. But no one's
culture — the upbuilding and
strengthening of all that is good in
him, wide range of intellect and
knowledge—can be too deep or too
broad. That may be called the
fundamental idea of our American
colleges and universities, and here
in may be found the highest boast
of our education, as it has been:
that without definite regard for a
learned profession, it affords the
possibility of an all-round train
ing, a broadening and elevating
culture for the common man,
widening his horizon and enabling
him to see truth and live truth.
Hut even with this it is evident
that our system is not, and never
has been, complete. We feel that
most when we follow up the differ
ent stages of the instructing body
as we have outlined the different
degrees of schools. Our teaching
can nowhere be better than the
teachers. Where are these trained?
Whence comes the great army of
teachers for our primary schools?
In general, from the secondary
schools. Whence the teachers of
the secondary schools? Nearly all
of them from the colleges and uni
versities. And where are the
teachers in the colleges and uni
versities trained? With few ex
ceptions, like most of our children's
doll's and hobby-horses, and for the
same reason, they bear the familiar
stamp, "Made in Germany." The
explanation is in either case the
same: Germany has the appli
ances for their production. Our
own want in this particular has
been felt ever since' the days of
Washington. The graduate de
partments appended to almost
every ambitious university in the
land are incontrovertible testimony
to the fact that in America we do
need and do want universities like
or superior to the German uni
versities. Academies of science, in
a feeble way, we already have.
The whole lower school is a great
mental gymnasium; everything is
aimed at training, developing; be

tween the master and the pupil
there is intellectually a great gulf;
for every exercise the master puts
the pupil through is to tne latter
dillicult, but to the former simple.
In the university this distance be
tween teacher and taught is less
ened. The student comes with
powers trained and his capacity
approximates more nearly that of
the instructor, while the latter is
for the same reason ready to meet
him more than half way. While
our college professors are perform
ing the double functions of in
vestigators and teachers they are
indeed doing their most teliing
personal work, the work that will
impress their personality most
imperishably upon the after world
and make themselves immortal;
but if their first and highest aim is
the advancement of their particular
science through their own personal
investigation, then every hour of
elementary instruction is a brake
upon the wheels of their power,
every hour's lecture that is made
to tit the needs of learners repre
sents so much time and energy
diverted from their proper channel.
We often hear of young men in
search of college positions who are
•'brilliant scholars," but dismal
failures as teachers. Their place
is not in the instructor's chair,
where their efforts at teaching will
be, both to themselves and to the
students, worse than wasted. If
they are investigators, our country
sh uld have a place for them, with
libraries, laboratories, and observa
tories, as well as for the teachers
who are scholars only less devoted
to the prosecution of research be
cause they have the spirit of teach
ing. The real investigator's best
will be attained only by giving
himself up absolutely to learning,
to pushing forward the outposts
of investigation and widening the
circuit of thought and knowledge
and never relaxing from the exer
tion of his highest power. These
are the men who can afford to
specialize in one small field of
science to the exclusion of every
thing else that is of interest to
humanity. Their work also is
essential to the advancement of the
race and to the growth of educa
tion; and the perfect educational
system must have a place for them
and for their work. One such
university our country already has
and will soon, we trust, have an
other —the National University—
to foster investigation and train
scholars, and so raise up the whole
standard of our national educa
tion. Thus, through the common
feature of instruction, the college
has its organic connection with the
high school; while it joins hands
with the higher universities through
the seminaries and laboratories
where the scholar that is to be is
trained in methods of independent
research and discovery of truth.
And when this idea 1 is consum
mated in our land; when those of
the colleges that can do so become
universities and those that can not
become universities fall naturally
into their places as training schools
for the real universities; then we
shall have a genuine system of edu
cation,and the National University
or Academy will be the pinnacle of
that system, rising as high above
our colleges as they above the
common schools.
The last defect to mention is the
most serious and will lie the most
difficult to correct, for it is the
most insidious and the most deeply
rooted. The curse of our edu a
tional spirit is "the tendency to look
upon education as a mere tool for
money-getting." Those who look

upon know ledge only from the stand
point of "practical" utility are likely
to seein the university only a bureau
for the delivery of special informa
tion, a mere warehouse for literary,
medical, or legal merchandise, in
stead of a temple of knowledge
and truth. The enrichment of
knowledge and power is not con
sidered and therefore not desired.
Too general is the conception in
our land that nothing is practical,
nothing is useful, even in matters
of pure intellect, unless it can be
translated into dollars and cents.
Art' we, brain and brawn, so wholly
enslaved to Mammon? Nay, can
it be denied that the same master
is enslaving, or has already en
slaved, even the intellectual pro
fessions —the bar, the bench, the
clinic, the chair, the studio, and
even the pulpit ? "Even where
science, art, and literature, the
things of the mind, are pursued
after a fashion, it is too often not
as an end, but as a means, not for
love, but to get rich or at least to
make a living." And for that very
reason it is usually "only after a
fashion' 1 that they are pursued.
To him who studies literature,
philosophy, or mathematics only as
a means to such an end, even
these pursuits of pure intellect are
as much a "bread and butter edu
cation" as law or medicine to him
who has no higher interest in his
science than financial advantage
to himself.
It is a matter for regret that
higher education has not more
frequently as its object disinterested
culture —the enriching and beauti
fying of the soul —but only the
practical, financial advantage of
the student. How few study Greek
and Latin and higher mathematics
any more just for the sake of know
ing them or as a means of calling
forth power, of cultivating taste
and character, right ambition, and
interest in great and high themes!
Is not the incentive to such studies
in these days rather a desire to
pass the examinations and get into
college, or, sometimes, to make a
living by teaching them, which is,
after all, only another way of
serving a selfish purpose? If they
could not be turned to immediate,
practical advantage, they would be
studied much less than they are.
In precisely the same way, most
students study physics or chemistry
not for the philosophic delight of
finding out the secrets of nature,
but solely to find through them a
means of livelihood, and, haply,
a certain advantage in the struggle
for wealth.
With all these faults and virtues
in view 1 come today to plead not
alone for the old education of
proper morals, polished manners,
elegant speech, nor yet for the new
education of exclusive science, but
for a proper balance between the
old and the new —the culture of
the humanities and of nature as a
basis for later specialization; and
for the concentration of all one's
ability afterward on some one por
tion of the vast lield of science and
knowledge. The principle upon
which the whole plea is based is
that true education must, have
three dimensions, length, breadth
and depth. Of these breadth must
be provided for in the undergradu
ate college course; the opportunity
will never come again, and can
never come again. Depth can
be added only in the special
training of the graduate university
and after study. Length is a rel
ative dimension depending upon
the length and intensity of life.
Hut all three must begin together.
The danger against which this

warning signal is raised is that
'specialization before breadth is
attained will prove to be not power
and culture, but weakness and nar
rowness. . . . It will be the Same,
whatever the line of premature
specialization. Exclusive devotion
from the beginning to the arts and
letters is ruinous to our best devel
opment, even though that has been
the proved and approved higher
education of the last four hundred
years. . . . And yet by confining
ourselves to such a course we come
to live so much in the realm of the
ideal that we ignore or forget the
real things around us. The great
literatures of the world are not our
only source of truth, nor the only
scene of beauty, nor the only
means of culture. The whole busi
ness of any man is to know and to
live the truth. He must have eyes
that will see truth wherever it may
be fmnd; and there are even
clearer, surer revelations of truth
in (Jod's world around us than in
the world of letters.
We must not fail to recognize
that there are some intellectual
constitutions which utterly refuse
to assimilate culture from scientific
study. So much the worse for
them, in like manner there are
many minds wholly unsusceptible
to the charms of classical poetry.
The more the pity for that. People
thus constituted will have to make
the best they can of a one-sided
culture; if they will only do the
best they can, their culture, for
which the university makes provi
sion, will not have been secured in
vain.
We are all in sympathy with
Professor Virchow'sdefinition: that
the aim of university study is gen
eral scientific and moral culture
together with the mastery of one
special department of study. We
have here at this university a prac
tical plan which has in itself all
the requisite qualities for realizing
the ideal condition of tilings. No
lixed curriculum or system of re
quired studies leading up to a de
gree can furnish to any number of
different minds the culture which
each one needs. Here the student
must have bis own central pur
pose, and it must be an earnest
purpose; toward that, as a central
axis of his life, all other radiating
lines must point. Whether these
radiating lines of light shall be
focused in all their intensity on
one single point, or illumine all
bis path through life and brighten
and help all who cross it there,
depends mainly on the individual
student's aims, but partly also on
him to whom that student looks
for special counsel.
At any rate, narrow specializing
should not begin until the student's
mind is thoroughly disciplined.
Whether that discipline is best
secured in the old-fashioned way
with Latin, Greek, and mathe
matics is a question which has two
good sides for debate. "There is,"
to quote from our President, "much
to be said in favor of the college in
which discipline pure and simple is
made the chief end of all the work.
In such a school those subjects —
languages, sciences, and philosophy
—which serve the ends of training
best, should be taught, and such
subjects only."
When we consider the two great
new principles of our age —the
conservation of energy with all the
wonders it has made possible in
the material world, and biological
evolution with all the marvels it
will produce in not only the phys
ical, but also the intellectual and
| spiritual well-being of the race —
the irresistible attractiveness of the
new education, the triumph of the
scientific education over iill compe
tition, and the preponderating
tendency of students of "practical"
minds to confine themselves to the
scientific education, are easily com
prehended. The educational pen
dulum has been steadily swinging
backward and forward ever since
modern education in the fifteenth
century began, first to one extreme,
and then to the other, as if no
middle ground were possible. Uni
versities were new things when the
Renaissance came. They had
been founded for "practical" pur
poses; and to the devotees of the
"practical" courses the introduction
of the classics was an innovation,
and the new learning was frowned
upon. The humanists of the Refor
mation period had a battle to fight
against tremendous odds. In order
to maintain any place at all, they
had to prove that literature was
delightful for its own sake, and
that Greece and Rome had some
thing worth while to teach to mod
ern men. The struggle was soon
over; the pendulum began to swing
ihe other way; the new learning
triumphed throughout all Europe;
and from the revival of learning
down almost to within the memory
of men still living, any education
without a good strong backbone of
Greek and Latin classics was no
education. Education meant clas
sical education. Hut human nature
rebels against extreme?, and as
surely as extremes prevail, so surely
will come reaction against them.
Thus again after the middle of the
last century, when new life caught
on the souls of men, and lifted
them out of the social and political
corruption of the times, when the
Encyclopedists, as the precursors of
the great Revolution, began the
revolution in the realms of science,
then again came the flight to
antiquity as the only source from
which to gain afresh the elements
of intellectual and artistic life. To
those great crises in civilization, to
those accomplishments of a race
of intellectual giants, humanity
returns again and again as to a
fountain of spiritual youth eternally
fresh and strong.
It is as strange now to reflect
that to the foolish conservatives of
four hundred years ago the classics
were an intolerable innovation, as
it is to think that Huxley and his
compeers had to contend so long
and so hard for the claims of sci
ence to recognition as a force for
culture in a modern education.
And now that the educational
sceptre has passed from classics to
science, and the scientific spirit
dominates every sphere, its more
radical advocates would crowd
entirely out of the field its most
formidable rival, the time-honored
humanistic culture, as having no
place whatever in an up-to-date
education. The pendulum hits
once more swung as far as it can
go. That spirit of science which
is intolerant, whether it is philo
logical science that inveighs against
natural science or natural science
that will allow no place to philo
logical science, is the primal cause
of the violent reactions that come
in the lines of education; that
readiness for revulsion is one of
the things that argue most potently
for the final triumph of breadth.
Intolerance is the child of narrow
ness of spirit; and when we all
dwell together in harmony, each
recognizing the value of all lines
of culture, breadth is assured.
And if Mr. King is right in
his estimate of the purely scientific
mind unbalanced by those mental

pursuits that feed the fancy, en
noble the sentiments, enable us to
enjoy beauty and harmony —and
the ardent advocate of the human
ities is easily persuaded to believe
him —then there is sure to come
against the technical scientific
education so fashionable in our
day a reaction strong enough to
bring about a tremendous revival
of the humanities, in the most
comprehensive sense of the word;
or, if a compromise can be effected,
it may at last stop the swinging
pendulum in'the middle and pro
duce the harmonious blending of
the two cultures that will give us
the full liberal education for which
this plea is made.
With a well-balanced education,
that antiquated narrow contempt
of the new education for the old
will he entirely forgotten. Then
in the eyes of the scientist the
humanist will 110 longer be a man
who can not '"see beyond the horizon
of his own shallow experience, and
who from his self-constructed
throne judges the rest of mankind
with the complacent assurance born
of a fancied superiority." Nor will
the humanist find in this promised
land so many Philistines —"full of
narrowness, full of prejudices, with
a defective type of religion, a nar
row range of intellect and knowl
edge, a stunted sense of beauty, a
low standard of manners, arid
averse, moreover, to whatever may
disturb it in its vulgarity " With
this breadth of intellectual culture,
and the physical culture that our
human nature demands and de
serves, our youth may with joy
enter into their six-fold inher
itance, physical, scientific, literary,
aesthetic, political, and religious,
which is their indisputable birth
right; and thus equipped they may
transmit it preserved and, in some
chosen field, enriched, to genera
tions yet to come. Lame, at least,
is the institution of learning that
withholds from its students any
one of the six.
The world's call is for the man
of learning who knows better than
any one elst how to do some one
thing; but he cannot meet the re
quirements if he knows nothing
but that one thing; he must know
it in its relation to other things; he
must see things in their proper
proportion. "What science and
practical life alike need," says
Professor Butler, "is not narrow
men, but broad men sharpened to a
point."
Let our new education be not a
vertical line, but a pyramid, of
which our present undergraduate
courses shall furnish the base large
and broad and solid; and let the
university of the future, and, until
it is realized, the graduate depart
ments of the present, supply the
apex. It may cost many a reluc
tant sacrifice of intellectual plea
sures as the narrowing process
begins and many more as it con
tinues. It may be painful, but it
is necessary. For in this day of
specialization only the specialist
can work out the best that is in
him and render back to society
what it has done for him. The
first law of the fullest perfection
says: He perfect; that is, cultivate
all your powers completely and
uniformly—as far as possible. And
the second law is like unto it:
Forward in some respect the per
fection of the race, which has made
your culture possible. And both
may lie included in the law of all
study: Learn only that you may
yourself create. For only through
this divine power of creation is any
one really man; without it he is
only a tolerably clever machine.

It is the business of every scholar
to do something to extend the
domains of knowledge in at least
some one direction, lie can not
afford all his life long to cultivate
nature and knowledge 011 all sides;
one life would never sullice even
to acquire a knowledge of what
the past has done in many depart
ments of thought and what is yet
to be done; and so that life and
its powers would be lost to the
world to which they should have
been consecrate. To some it may
lie painful to think that we must
live on and die and leave many a
wide field of knowledge untraversed
and unknown. This longing to
learn everything is in itself a noble
element of our nature, and leads to
noble results; but it requires to be
checked by the stern voice of duty.
Otherwise we should be living to
self—living off the world's bounty.
The world owes no man anything;
but every man owes the world all
that he has and is, for the growth
of the past has made the possibili
ties of the present. No one has a
right to labor for his own enjoy
ment merely or keep bis education
for his own gratification. Every
true scholar, therefore, must, ac
cording to taste or natural capacity
or previous training, make his
choice of that side of his nature to
which he will give the preference,
and, after the foundation of the
pyramid of his education has been
laid broad and strong, rear the
superstructure, narrowing as it
aspires, llis own culture in its
other departments must be left to
take care of itself. Therein con
sists the higher sacrifice. And the
more useful the scholar's life is to
be, the higher wili be the sacrifice
he must make, and the more he
will have to surrender of that very
culture without which his genius
would have been unstable and
helpless. He lias no choice in the
matter. He must turn his back
upon many an avenue for self
culture opened up to him by nature
in order to devote ail his natural
gifts and all his acquired powers
to the superior development of one
or more capacities.
But for a student to specialize on
one line too early in his career is
to deprive himself of the half of his
soul and shut himself up too early to
a trade. That is technical training,
not education. If professional
training is a benefit, it is so in
greater or less degree according to
the measure of the culture and at
tainment which one brings to such
study. Ail professional training,
all specializing, if it is going 10
accomplish that which is best in
its own sphere, must he built up
like our pyramid, step by step,
upon the foundations of a culture
br ad and deep. And the higher
we build the pyramid of special
knowledge, the broader and deeper
must its foundations have been
laid aid the more carefully must
these have been calculated for that
special superstructure they are to
bear. This is the realm of the
human mind. Without that, law,
medicine, or any other profession
is practically helpless. We can
not take hoys from 1 lie byways and
hedges, teach them to read and
write and do simple sums, then
give them a two or three years'
course in a medical school and ex
pect them to do much for the last
ing betterment of the human race.
Here and there one or two may,
through chance or through some
God-given talent, help somewhat
to that end, but we have no reason
to expect that with the preparation
they have had they will succeed in
doing so. We force into every

profession boys (and girls) from
our lower schools with minds ab
solutely untrained and utterly in
capable of living up to the best
they might, if it were not for our
American weakness of being for
ever in a rush. Our colleges have
made provision for meeting just
this difficulty, but in our overhaste
to get into the struggle for exist
ence that provision is ignored. If
there is any one thing which more
than another distinguishes our
American university from other
universities it is this: that whereas
the German university exists for
the production of scholars, in
vestigators, and the English uni
versity for the production of
clergymen and the polish of young
noblemen, the American university
exists primarily for purposes of
culture —the culture of the common
man. The question of usefulness
or of "practical" value in this
culture stage of higher education is
now, we may happily say, among
educated men but very seldom
raised; or if it is raised, it is only
for the purpose of putting it down
the more effectually. In the pro
duction of culture everything de
pends upon truth; practical utility
(in the vulgar sense) is altogether
a secondary matter, in the truer
sense of the word, anything is
practical that makes a man or a
community or a state or a nation
stronger or better or wiser, any
thing that helps a man to live up
to the best that is in him, to be
true to himself, to bis neighbor,
and to bis God. That is practical
and nothing else is, except as it is
wrought through such a medium.
The scholar's work may bring him
in his daily bread, yes, even
wealth. But that is only inci
dental; it is not the most real nor
the noblest function of his work,
nor even the most practical.
But whatever your education, it
must be returned with proper in
crease tc> the world that gave it to
you. Of what use to your college
or your country or this world, to
whose betterment your best should
be consecrated —of what use to any
body or anything but yourself, is
your education if you become not
the leaders of thought and the
teachers of those who follow to
make up the forces that make for
righteousness and the advancement
of truth? Your first calling is that
you be witnesses of the Truth.
Every scholar, every educated man,
to live out the best of which he is
capable, must be the "living spirit
of knowledge"; he ought to be
morally the best man of his age,
and he must in some way or other
be a teacher, whatever bis other
profession or professions in life;
and "they that be teachers shall
shine as the brightness of the firm
ament, and they that turn many
to righteousaess as the stars for
ever and ever.''
You that have attained so much
of the skill required to overcome
and correct the improper tendencies
of the natural man, to combat
ignorance and vice and build up in
their place knowledge and right
eousness; you that have acquired
so much of culture that you are
ready to be sent forth into the
world to do —to teach and to bless
—remember always that you are
destined to act and react with a
most powerful influence upon hu
manity. Whether the circle of
your influence be wide or narrow,
the culture you have received is to
be extended to others and every
where to lift up our common
brotherhood to a higher plane of
living.
We have made it our highest
aim to contribute to the culture
and elevation of humanity in you
and in all with whom you may
ever have a common point of con
tact. All knowledge and all sci
ence that we may command, which
does not tend to that end, is vain
and worthless. How successful it
shall be in attaining that end has
depended upon the spirit in which
you have received what has been
afforded here and will depend also
upon the spirit and faithfulness
with which you carry further the
lessons of truth you have learned
and upon the increase and trans
mission of the power you have
made your own. You go forth
believing in the ultimate triumph
of the good, with your ideals of
what humanity ought to be; is
humanity up to your ideal? If
not, then you can not be true to
yourself, to your neighbor, or to
your God, if you fail to devote all
your best powers, your best self, to
the elevation of the humanity you
find about you up to the ideals you
cherish for yourselves.
You have your life problems to
face, not alone tbese literary, in
tellectual, and educational prob
lems the proper solution of which
will raise us above the present
''hopeful level of Philistine vulgar
ity" which we are accused of occu
pying, and make us to be leaders
ot the world in things of pure in
tellect as well as in lines of
mechanical application of scientific
principles; that is yours to bring
about; but you have also just
as serious social, economic, and
political problems, and the world
looks to you to solve them. The
questions of finance must be
answered by college men; the rela
tion of capital to labor, the question
of trusts, of marriage and divorce,
and of the reform of municipal
government, the annihilation of
that worst enemy of education and
morals, that legalized destroyer of
men and property —the saloon—
these are grave problems which
call for the application of the best
minds and strongest characters our
colleges can develop.
"The old order changeth, yielding place
to new,
And God fulfills Himself in many ways,
Lest one good custom should corrupt t he
world."
The land in which we live is
called "the New World," and our
individual lot is cast in the newest
part of it. The problems, educa
tional as well as political, which
our country has had to face are,
many of them, new. We have
grown up, as far as we have grown
at all, under the stimulus of condi
tions all our own. We have been
bound by no distant past nor
necessarily hampered by the tradi
tions of the lands from which our
fathers came. Most of our short
national life has so far been an
experiment. What the experiment
will prove will he known when our
young western world has grown to
age. In the meantime all the
civilized world is watching with
eager eyes each new stage of our
experimenting. In our present
state we are generally accused of
being a nation of mediocrity, except
in bulk. One century has seen us
suddenly transformed from three
million subject colonists on the
Atlantic sea-board into a nation of
sixty million sovereign citizens
whose dominions reach from ocean
to ocean. Similarly our culture is
full grown hut immature, like a
boy of sixteen six feet tall. The
like of our system (or want of sys
tem) of education was never seen
nor ever dreamed of before. Our
grammar school may find its
counterpart in the old world; but
our American high school is
neither the English grammar
school nor the German gymnasium
nor the French Lycee. Our Amer
ican college may he the outgrowth
of the Oxford and Cambridge idea
further developed, but the Amer
ican university is not the Englisl
university nor the German univer
sity. It is a mixed product grown
up under new conditions on new
soil.
Europe makes merry over our
481 colleges and universities and
wonders how they all manage to
exist. Never mind Europe; we do
the same ourselves. Hut our col
leges which we count by hundreds
are a necessary link in the evolu
tion of a coming educational system
worthy of our western civilization;
for as they are, they represent and
foster the spirit of our national
life. Every nation must in her
own way show that she has abiding
in her the love of truth; and that
love can best be cherished only in
ways that conform to her own
character and promise the fulfill
ment of her own purposes. In the
development to which we look for
ward, who can say that we have
too many colleges now? They will
rather be found too few. There is
scarcely a community in the length
and breadth of our land that would
not gladly make large sacrifices to
secure in its midst the location of a
promising college and so increase
the present list. When the ideal
of the American university is real
ized and the college of to-day falls
into its natural place as a school of

culture and of preparation for the
higher university of tomorrow, we
shall find that we have after all
too few rather than too many col
leges. Such a result Would be hut
another of history's repetitions.
For the first twelve years of higher
education in Michigan, when uni
versities did not mean much more
in the way of education than high
schools do now, that commonwealth
had no less than nine state colleges.
They all struggled along at starva
tion rates. Hut they were far from
being a menace to society or a
danger to education. For as one
of the nine grew into a university,
the other eight, as was right and
best, fell into their natural place as
preparatory schools of a high order
feeders for the one real univer
sity. And today we regret only
that there had not been more of
those "starveling" colleges to follow
the same course. Now that ideals
have grown upward and expanded,
the same development may take
place to our well-being on the pres
ent higher plane. Our college cur-

riculum lias undergone wondrous
changes in the last '200 years; the
garment that was placed upon the
American college in its infancy has
heen long since outgrown, and the
patterns after which it was cut are
no longer in fashion. The oldest
of our colleges is, in comparison
with Paris and Oxford, as far as
years are concerned, still in its
childhood. And who knows hut
the spirit that planted these 4<Sl
colleges will yet realize its fulfill
ment in the "true idea of a univer
sity''? What will that consumma
tion be?
Our present system (if what we
have may fairly he called a system)
is a development, with the various
additions and other changes that
come with growth, out of the edu
cation of past ages. In order to
determine what the next stage in
its growth will he we must examine
the history of its growth through
the past and the conditions and
tendencies of its present stage.
Our whole modern civilization in
its existent forms, this age of steel
and steam and electricity, with all
its triumphs of applied science in

the creation of great labor-saving
machinery, in rapid transit and the
annihilation of distance and time,
is a wondrous growth, exceeding in
this one century in these particu
lars the sum total of all that pre
vious history has recorded. Hut
follow this marvelous shoot down
ward to the stem and we shall find
that it is after all a graft. "The
same," to use Professor William
Smith's figure, "The same was en
grafted upon the sturdy stem of the
olden culture, a stem that struck
its roots deep into the sacred soil
of Greece and Home, through the
rich accumulated alluvium of
nearly thirty centuries. Into this
graft, this new scion, the generous
sap of the ancient trunk has been
poured abundantly and a pro
digious growth and wonderful
fruitage have resulted."
The art of Greece has been the
inspiration, the wonder, and the
despair of all artists since the day
when the lofty spirit of Hellenic
greatness began to Hag. The
mythology of Greece lias become

the language of symbol among all
civilized peoples of whatever name
and tongue. The poetry, the phil
osophy, the ethics, and the science
as well as the arts of Greece,
illumine every modern classic
page. Says Alfred Baker, professor
of mathematics in Toronto: "If
we should ever think of a people —
a chosen people —who had a mes
sage and a revelation to the world,
that people was the ancient Greeks.
We owe them an incalculable debt
for our knowledge of art, literature,
and science, and of the three our
debt is perhaps greatest for their
legacy of science." Whether con
sciously or unconsciously, we build
upon foundations laid, or at least
after plans drawn, by the great
thinkers —poets, artists, philoso
phers, scientists —of the days when
man was, in both body and intel
lect, at bis best. Even this present
age of scientific education is but
continuing the work where Greece
left off, and without the pioneering
work done by the science of those
old days and without the literature
of Greece upon whose light some men
of science now see tit to turn their

backs, our own science would have
bmt forced to go back to the most
primitive conceptions of nature and
waste centuries in traveling the
roads which the classical thinkers
built through unbroken wilds and
trod for us. Others have labored
and we have entered into their
labors.
If, then, the impression left by
the Hellenic spirit upon our world
of art and letters has l>een so strong
and so abiding, what of our inher
itance of educational ideals from
the same source? And if the
disciple has not been greater than
the master in those expressions of
creative genius, has the master
been surpassed in the business of
educating men and training the
powers in them for the creation of
great ideas and great ideals?
Though ignorance may some
times sneer and "self-complacent
modernism" sometimes assail, yet
one need not be a mere praiser of
the times that are gone to assert
that that age saw, in at least some
strata of society, man at his high
est and best since his creation, both
mentally and physically. "The
theories of the seers stood the test
of application by the men of
deeds." (Butler.) And so it is
our right, and our duty as well to
ask how that condition was real
ized, and why we, with the example
of their successes and their failures
and with the addition of the spirit
that was introduced by way of
Bethlehem and Calvary, can not
attain to that and better than that
by the addition of the moral and
spiritual strength that is ours from
on high.
The problems that the young
Athenians of brains and power had
to face were not so very different
from those which confront the
young American. Their polity
was, as ours is called, a democracy
—a government of the people by
the people. Their youth must,
therefore, be fitted (and so must
ours) not only for good citizenship,
but for the highest duties of citi
zens who are also rulers. Was
their course of training for it dif
ferent from ours? Have we learned
from it all that we can apply with
advantage to our own conditions?
The feature of Athenian educa
tion that has been most overlooked
in the modern was the love of the
beautiful. This was the dominat
ing principle in education, and we
would do well not to leave the
Aesthetic sense longer in neglect.
Hellenic sanity —soundness of body
and of intellect and of all that is
produced by either —is proverbial.
And through it all must run the
golden thread of beauty. As they
developed their language to its
peerless beauty and expressiveness,
as Callicrates and Ictinus reared
their wondrous temples, as Phidias
and Praxiteles carved their statues
and Polygnotus and Apelles spread
their canvases with perfect beauty
and symmetry, so they trained the
intellect and the soul into beauty
and strength, and so they trained
the body with a view to the beauti
ful and strong; and everything
that could tend in the opposite
direction was strictly proscribed.
In general, our universities, high
schools or gymnasia, and common


PROFESSOR WALTER MILLER
schools have their prototypes in
the similar institutions of classical
Athens. The fundamental prin
ciples even of the kindergarten we
find clearly set forth in the Repub
lic of Plato and embodied in his
infant-school.
The aim of the public school was
to awaken the minds of the youth
and help them to find the place in
the world that each could fill
better than any other, and above
all to furnish that sesthetic culture
which all ages have considered
important and which some still
reckon the paramount object of
our higher education.
The theory that education, as
distinguished from special train
ing, should afford a broad general
culture and that this is best secured
by a study of "humanity," or the
"humanities," is older than Soc
rates, new as to-day. That it has
been a suitable foundation upon
which to build our own educational
systems is not too much to assert;
for it is safe to say that through
that method of education, rather
than in spite of it, men were pro
duced who were in real training of
mind, in mastery of principles and
knowledge of men, in capacity for
every form of mental effort, from
the most refined speculation to the
conduct of every day affairs of
state and of business, the most
perfectly educated people the world
has ever seen.
That sort of training aimed at
producing not professional athletes,
nor musicians, nor mathemati
cians, but men, men of thought and
of action, who should be capable
of taking front rank in whatever
special lines of activity their after
life might lead. Competition then
was no less keen than it is now;
only that man received first honors
then and eternal fame to come,
who in his day could do some one
thing better than any other man
in Athens. Xenophon,in his Edu
cation of Cyrus, brings out the
necessity they felt for trained
specialists when he says that "those
w r ho give up paying attention to
many things and devote themselves
to some one thing, they are sure to
be the best in their particular
line." But such specialization, as
his words clearly imply, was re
served until after breadth of culture
was secured.
After a preparation of this kind,
the young man might devote him
self with perfect freedom of choice
all but exclusively to some one de
partment of knowledge. To afford
this special training was the busi
ness of the university. For from
the day of Gorgias, Socrates, Plato,
Athens had taken her place as the
university city of the world; and
she maintained it (even against the
glitter of the Ptolemaic state uni
versity at Alexandria) until nar
row-minded despotism closed her
doors and smothered the fires of
knowledge, which could not die but
smouldered on beneath the ashes,
to be fanned again into living
flame with the revival of learning
in the sixteenth century. That
university had its departments of
art, science, economics, philosophy,
letters, and each great teacher was
a special department unto himself;
it was, thus constituted, a univer
sity in the truest sense of the word,
although not organized with a
board of trustees and a cast-iron
charter, a university built not of
bricks but of brains, not with
mortar but with men; and it
exerted an influence that not only
filled the world then, but has made
itself felt even until now and will
continue to be a power as long as
there are students to study.

From even this cursory sketch it
may be seen from what beginnings
all our modern systems of education
have grown. For the Greeks have
been the school-masters of the
nations ;is today is the school
master of tomorrow. When Rome
made the soil of Hellas a Roman
province but bowed in humble
submission before the power of her
captive's intellect and fell herself a
captive to Grecian arts and letters,
the Athenian education was bodily
transplanted to Italian soil. As
ime progressed, the martial vigor
of Rome became a part of the bone
and tissue of the imported culture
of the lower schools; but the uni
versity was still at Athens, though
rivalled for a time by Alexandria
and Rhodes.
Rome spread her power and her
language over all western Europe,
and the official Latin tongue be
came the first and the chief subject
of study in the schools as the only
means of social and political and
afterwards ecclesiastical advance
ment. On one ground or another,
if for nothing more than mere tra
dition, it has maintained ils place
as the first and most essential
element in educational systems
that still exist as models of all that
should be.
Barbarism and Christianity
joined hands to crush the old uni
versity centres and blot out Grecian
culture from the world. Their
success, while not absolute, was
only too complete. The extin
guishing of the light of letters left
the world in darkness and gloom
for centuries with only here and
there a flickering rush light of
logical, mystical, or ecclesiastical
subtleties. Such profound ques
tions as how many spirits could
stand together upon the point of a
cambric needle, or whether a spirit
could pass from one point to an
other without passing through the
intervening space, however absurd
and valueless they may appear,
nevertheless did serve to sharpen
men's wits and to make them
hunger and thirst after real ideas.
Whence should spring the fountain
for satisfying such thirst? Had
all possibility of real ideas van
ished from the earth? There had
been creators of ideals once; had
their products all vanished with
the departure of their culture and
their power? Through the dark
ages the capacity for ideas seems to
have died out in men. For the
world was asleep —asleep for a
thousand years of rest and re-crea
tion. In the twelfth century it
began to awake, and with the
Italian Renaissance the dead ca
pacity for ideas was reborn.
"There were many forces," says
Professor Shoup, "that worked to
gether to produce the Renaissance,
but in Italy, at least, the main
cause was the recovery and study
of the Greek and Latin classics,
aided by the ever-present object
lessons of the grandeur of Roman
architecture and the loveliness of
Greek sculpture."
Thus with the rebirth of the
Athenian spirit among men came
also the resurrection of the univer
sity idea. The mediaeval universi
ties had hitherto provided for law,
theology, and medicine. The new
movement, which saved the arts
and sciences of Greece and Rome,
now brought in the''humanities"
as the education of culture —the
philosophical faculty—and the way
was opened wide 'or the easy de
velopment of the modern univer
sity. "The culture of the classics
bad to be re-appropriated before
the movement of the modern mind
could begin." (Symonds.) It was

through them that came again the
spiritual freedom, the intellectual
culture, the powers of criticism,
of comparison, and of scientific re
search that make an ideal educa
tion possible in our own day. And
with all the advances of the "new
education" the humanities are still
the humanities, enriched by many
a wholesome increment. Amid all
the other agencies for culture they
still form the essential element to
that aesthetic culture which all
consider important and which some
consider paramount, though we all
recognize that the world has many
things to learn besides Greek and
Latin.
Out of this new shoot springing
up from the old olive stump of
intellectual Attica have branched
forth the various scions which are
our modern universities. The evo
lution of the university has been,
like evolution in the natural world,
a spiral now rising, again descend
ing upon itself, but gaining with
each new circle. And as in the
organic world old forms die and
new ones come in, not created out
of nothing, but simply transforma
tions of the old: so our modern
higher education is but the old
university ideal transformed or
transforming, but not yet glorified.
Nothing really new has been added
to the sap in the veins of the tree
of knowledge, for all the grafts
that hive been set upon it. The
kindergarten, the grammar school,
the college and the university, with
its science and letters, its co
education, its elective system and
its majors and minors—but no de
grees —are as old as Plato. Indeed,
so little has the university ideal
grown since the unrivalled intel
lectual genius of Athens at the
climax of her intellectual power
evolved it, that it may be (and
since this paragraph was penned,
has been) seriously questioned
whether there is any such thing as
the "new education." "There is
nothing new under the sun" is no
where more true or false than in
the intellectual world. Sir Henry
, Maine goes so far as to say that
"Except the blind forces of Nature,
nothing moves in this world which
is not Greek in its origin." There
have been many revivals of knowl
edge besides the Italian Renais
sance; within a few years zoology,
chemistry, and geology have all
been born again. How hard we
toil to advance knowledge by in
troducing some "new" institution,
discovering some new truth. Hut
truth is eternal; and when our dis
covery is made we find the real
meaning of the poet's words:
"Wer kan 11 was (Dummes, wer was)
Kluges denken
Das nicht die Vorweltschon gedacht?"
Through all the growth and de
velopment of both the old and the
new the purpose of the university
has been always the same: not for
learning things, but for learning
how to learn things; not for cram
ming the memory with facts and
dates, but for teaching how to ob
serve facts and to cultivate a sense
of their relativity and the spirit of
criticism; not merely for enriching
the understanding, but for the
creation of a new life, the awaken
ing of a higher, nobler, truly scien
tific spirit, the culture and develop
ment of the thinking mind.
Education is the leading of the
young up into the intellectual and
spiritual kingdom that is theirs by
right of inheritance.
Sometimes it has been forgotten
that this can not be gained through
force or by following mechanical
forms and rules; nor can it be
secured in any other atmosphere

than one of freedom, with all of its
privileges and all of its responsi
bilities. The ''winds of freedom"
also were let loose from the yEolian
cave, and only too often have they
been lashed and locked in again.
Now perfect intellectual freedom
is ours once more. The attainment
of the true ideal of education,
from the kindergarten to the acad
emy of scholars, is almost within
our grasp. Shall we in our day
realize the ideal? If so, there are
a few faults in our American edu
cation which must he eradicated,
and the whole system must he
brought into line with the general
upward trend.
In the first place, in order to
make the true ideal of American
education a reality and to secure
breadth of culture combined with
power in some special field, tlie
work of the lower schools must be
made more thorough and more
effective. Those of our secondary
schools whose avowed purpose is to
fit its pupils for college, and that,
too, for some particular college, are
by far the most satisfactory in their
results. But in general our chil
dren come out of the common
school with little interest in the
higher life, iittle feeling and less
power of expressing the feeling
they have. They have no more
yearning after culture and sym
metrical training and healthy
growth than has the rose-bush in
the garden. The same reform that
will put a new spirit into our sec
ondary schools to render them
more effective will necessarily bring
with it a more desirable saving of
time for securing in college the
breadth of culture needed for the
most effective specializing in some
one fieid of knowledge afterward.
Then, in the second place, we
need some real system of organic
connection between our various
schools. There should be no leaps
in the mental development any
more than there are in natural
growth; as it is, however, our pupils
must successfully make several
before they reach the blissful goal
of an academic degree. The sec
ondary school has no rational
connection with the primary de
partment on the one hand; and on
the other, while it does not pretend
itself to be the apex of any educa
tional system, it still has as an
institution no vital connection with
the higher seminaries of learning.
It has begun, to the no small detri
ment of the youth, to ape univer
stiv methods —encouragingchildren
in knickerbockers and short skirts
to pursue all their knowledge, sci
entific, literary, and historical, back
to its ultimate sources! And that,
before they, or even nine-tenths of
their teachers, know what an ulti
mate source is, or how to judge one
critically if they should happen to
stumble upon it! Nothing could
be further from the real purpose of
the high school than the production
of scholarship.
And as the secondary education
has not yet settled down into its
own proper sphere, so the university
has not been able to draw its own
differentiating line just where it
ought to be, and seems compelled
to teach high school subjects in
high school ways. There is as
little propriety in the university's
whipping bad English into shape
and drilling on the elements of
Latin or French or German as
there is in the high school's at
tempting to teach Roman history
from ''the sources."
When lines are properly drawn
and the desired organic connection
made, we may see a straight and
steady growth from infancy to
scholarship with an appreciable
saving of precious years now
wasted through lack of definite
purpose. Our secondary schools
will he an immediate continuation
of the primary; the high schuol
and the college will cease to overlap
each other; and the college or uni
versity will in its turn be a contin
uation of the high schuol as the
high school of the grammar school,
but necessarily something more;
not even this institution, however,
may be regarded as a factory for
turning out scholars; the under
graduate college will be a place
where, with the help of great
teachers, great libraries and lab
oratories, any student may find the
training that will give him culture
and strength. In the case of those
who have not already set their in
tellectual ambitions upon some
definite line of life work the culture
must be particularly broad that it
may find their peculiar talents out
and awaken their love for that
work which they are best adapted
to do. The university, as it is, is
not for the purpose of making
scholars, but for developing the
men and women out of whom
scholars, investigators, teachers,
statesmen, may be made. It is not
necessary, nor even desirable, that
all our masses should be scholars;
the best "out-living" is not likely
to be given by one whose time is
wholly spent over ancient manu
scripts or over a microscope. To
live a life of righteousness, to do no
wrong to any man, to master one's
own self, to serve God and one's
fellow-men —all that needs no
scholarly erudition. But no one's
culture — the upbuilding and
strengthening of all that is good in
him, wide range of intellect and
knowledge—can be too deep or too
broad. That may be called the
fundamental idea of our American
colleges and universities, and here
in may be found the highest boast
of our education, as it has been:
that without definite regard for a
learned profession, it affords the
possibility of an all-round train
ing, a broadening and elevating
culture for the common man,
widening his horizon and enabling
him to see truth and live truth.
Hut even with this it is evident
that our system is not, and never
has been, complete. We feel that
most when we follow up the differ
ent stages of the instructing body
as we have outlined the different
degrees of schools. Our teaching
can nowhere be better than the
teachers. Where are these trained?
Whence comes the great army of
teachers for our primary schools?
In general, from the secondary
schools. Whence the teachers of
the secondary schools? Nearly all
of them from the colleges and uni
versities. And where are the
teachers in the colleges and uni
versities trained? With few ex
ceptions, like most of our children's
doll's and hobby-horses, and for the
same reason, they bear the familiar
stamp, "Made in Germany." The
explanation is in either case the
same: Germany has the appli
ances for their production. Our
own want in this particular has
been felt ever since' the days of
Washington. The graduate de
partments appended to almost
every ambitious university in the
land are incontrovertible testimony
to the fact that in America we do
need and do want universities like
or superior to the German uni
versities. Academies of science, in
a feeble way, we already have.
The whole lower school is a great
mental gymnasium; everything is
aimed at training, developing; be

tween the master and the pupil
there is intellectually a great gulf;
for every exercise the master puts
the pupil through is to tne latter
dillicult, but to the former simple.
In the university this distance be
tween teacher and taught is less
ened. The student comes with
powers trained and his capacity
approximates more nearly that of
the instructor, while the latter is
for the same reason ready to meet
him more than half way. While
our college professors are perform
ing the double functions of in
vestigators and teachers they are
indeed doing their most teliing
personal work, the work that will
impress their personality most
imperishably upon the after world
and make themselves immortal;
but if their first and highest aim is
the advancement of their particular
science through their own personal
investigation, then every hour of
elementary instruction is a brake
upon the wheels of their power,
every hour's lecture that is made
to tit the needs of learners repre
sents so much time and energy
diverted from their proper channel.
We often hear of young men in
search of college positions who are
•'brilliant scholars," but dismal
failures as teachers. Their place
is not in the instructor's chair,
where their efforts at teaching will
be, both to themselves and to the
students, worse than wasted. If
they are investigators, our country
sh uld have a place for them, with
libraries, laboratories, and observa
tories, as well as for the teachers
who are scholars only less devoted
to the prosecution of research be
cause they have the spirit of teach
ing. The real investigator's best
will be attained only by giving
himself up absolutely to learning,
to pushing forward the outposts
of investigation and widening the
circuit of thought and knowledge
and never relaxing from the exer
tion of his highest power. These
are the men who can afford to
specialize in one small field of
science to the exclusion of every
thing else that is of interest to
humanity. Their work also is
essential to the advancement of the
race and to the growth of educa
tion; and the perfect educational
system must have a place for them
and for their work. One such
university our country already has
and will soon, we trust, have an
other —the National University—
to foster investigation and train
scholars, and so raise up the whole
standard of our national educa
tion. Thus, through the common
feature of instruction, the college
has its organic connection with the
high school; while it joins hands
with the higher universities through
the seminaries and laboratories
where the scholar that is to be is
trained in methods of independent
research and discovery of truth.
And when this idea 1 is consum
mated in our land; when those of
the colleges that can do so become
universities and those that can not
become universities fall naturally
into their places as training schools
for the real universities; then we
shall have a genuine system of edu
cation,and the National University
or Academy will be the pinnacle of
that system, rising as high above
our colleges as they above the
common schools.
The last defect to mention is the
most serious and will lie the most
difficult to correct, for it is the
most insidious and the most deeply
rooted. The curse of our edu a
tional spirit is "the tendency to look
upon education as a mere tool for
money-getting." Those who look

upon know ledge only from the stand
point of "practical" utility are likely
to seein the university only a bureau
for the delivery of special informa
tion, a mere warehouse for literary,
medical, or legal merchandise, in
stead of a temple of knowledge
and truth. The enrichment of
knowledge and power is not con
sidered and therefore not desired.
Too general is the conception in
our land that nothing is practical,
nothing is useful, even in matters
of pure intellect, unless it can be
translated into dollars and cents.
Art' we, brain and brawn, so wholly
enslaved to Mammon? Nay, can
it be denied that the same master
is enslaving, or has already en
slaved, even the intellectual pro
fessions —the bar, the bench, the
clinic, the chair, the studio, and
even the pulpit ? "Even where
science, art, and literature, the
things of the mind, are pursued
after a fashion, it is too often not
as an end, but as a means, not for
love, but to get rich or at least to
make a living." And for that very
reason it is usually "only after a
fashion' 1 that they are pursued.
To him who studies literature,
philosophy, or mathematics only as
a means to such an end, even
these pursuits of pure intellect are
as much a "bread and butter edu
cation" as law or medicine to him
who has no higher interest in his
science than financial advantage
to himself.
It is a matter for regret that
higher education has not more
frequently as its object disinterested
culture —the enriching and beauti
fying of the soul —but only the
practical, financial advantage of
the student. How few study Greek
and Latin and higher mathematics
any more just for the sake of know
ing them or as a means of calling
forth power, of cultivating taste
and character, right ambition, and
interest in great and high themes!
Is not the incentive to such studies
in these days rather a desire to
pass the examinations and get into
college, or, sometimes, to make a
living by teaching them, which is,
after all, only another way of
serving a selfish purpose? If they
could not be turned to immediate,
practical advantage, they would be
studied much less than they are.
In precisely the same way, most
students study physics or chemistry
not for the philosophic delight of
finding out the secrets of nature,
but solely to find through them a
means of livelihood, and, haply,
a certain advantage in the struggle
for wealth.
With all these faults and virtues
in view 1 come today to plead not
alone for the old education of
proper morals, polished manners,
elegant speech, nor yet for the new
education of exclusive science, but
for a proper balance between the
old and the new —the culture of
the humanities and of nature as a
basis for later specialization; and
for the concentration of all one's
ability afterward on some one por
tion of the vast lield of science and
knowledge. The principle upon
which the whole plea is based is
that true education must, have
three dimensions, length, breadth
and depth. Of these breadth must
be provided for in the undergradu
ate college course; the opportunity
will never come again, and can
never come again. Depth can
be added only in the special
training of the graduate university
and after study. Length is a rel
ative dimension depending upon
the length and intensity of life.
Hut all three must begin together.
The danger against which this

warning signal is raised is that
'specialization before breadth is
attained will prove to be not power
and culture, but weakness and nar
rowness. . . . It will be the Same,
whatever the line of premature
specialization. Exclusive devotion
from the beginning to the arts and
letters is ruinous to our best devel
opment, even though that has been
the proved and approved higher
education of the last four hundred
years. . . . And yet by confining
ourselves to such a course we come
to live so much in the realm of the
ideal that we ignore or forget the
real things around us. The great
literatures of the world are not our
only source of truth, nor the only
scene of beauty, nor the only
means of culture. The whole busi
ness of any man is to know and to
live the truth. He must have eyes
that will see truth wherever it may
be fmnd; and there are even
clearer, surer revelations of truth
in (Jod's world around us than in
the world of letters.
We must not fail to recognize
that there are some intellectual
constitutions which utterly refuse
to assimilate culture from scientific
study. So much the worse for
them, in like manner there are
many minds wholly unsusceptible
to the charms of classical poetry.
The more the pity for that. People
thus constituted will have to make
the best they can of a one-sided
culture; if they will only do the
best they can, their culture, for
which the university makes provi
sion, will not have been secured in
vain.
We are all in sympathy with
Professor Virchow'sdefinition: that
the aim of university study is gen
eral scientific and moral culture
together with the mastery of one
special department of study. We
have here at this university a prac
tical plan which has in itself all
the requisite qualities for realizing
the ideal condition of tilings. No
lixed curriculum or system of re
quired studies leading up to a de
gree can furnish to any number of
different minds the culture which
each one needs. Here the student
must have bis own central pur
pose, and it must be an earnest
purpose; toward that, as a central
axis of his life, all other radiating
lines must point. Whether these
radiating lines of light shall be
focused in all their intensity on
one single point, or illumine all
bis path through life and brighten
and help all who cross it there,
depends mainly on the individual
student's aims, but partly also on
him to whom that student looks
for special counsel.
At any rate, narrow specializing
should not begin until the student's
mind is thoroughly disciplined.
Whether that discipline is best
secured in the old-fashioned way
with Latin, Greek, and mathe
matics is a question which has two
good sides for debate. "There is,"
to quote from our President, "much
to be said in favor of the college in
which discipline pure and simple is
made the chief end of all the work.
In such a school those subjects —
languages, sciences, and philosophy
—which serve the ends of training
best, should be taught, and such
subjects only."
When we consider the two great
new principles of our age —the
conservation of energy with all the
wonders it has made possible in
the material world, and biological
evolution with all the marvels it
will produce in not only the phys
ical, but also the intellectual and
| spiritual well-being of the race —
the irresistible attractiveness of the
new education, the triumph of the
scientific education over iill compe
tition, and the preponderating
tendency of students of "practical"
minds to confine themselves to the
scientific education, are easily com
prehended. The educational pen
dulum has been steadily swinging
backward and forward ever since
modern education in the fifteenth
century began, first to one extreme,
and then to the other, as if no
middle ground were possible. Uni
versities were new things when the
Renaissance came. They had
been founded for "practical" pur
poses; and to the devotees of the
"practical" courses the introduction
of the classics was an innovation,
and the new learning was frowned
upon. The humanists of the Refor
mation period had a battle to fight
against tremendous odds. In order
to maintain any place at all, they
had to prove that literature was
delightful for its own sake, and
that Greece and Rome had some
thing worth while to teach to mod
ern men. The struggle was soon
over; the pendulum began to swing
ihe other way; the new learning
triumphed throughout all Europe;
and from the revival of learning
down almost to within the memory
of men still living, any education
without a good strong backbone of
Greek and Latin classics was no
education. Education meant clas
sical education. Hut human nature
rebels against extreme?, and as
surely as extremes prevail, so surely
will come reaction against them.
Thus again after the middle of the
last century, when new life caught
on the souls of men, and lifted
them out of the social and political
corruption of the times, when the
Encyclopedists, as the precursors of
the great Revolution, began the
revolution in the realms of science,
then again came the flight to
antiquity as the only source from
which to gain afresh the elements
of intellectual and artistic life. To
those great crises in civilization, to
those accomplishments of a race
of intellectual giants, humanity
returns again and again as to a
fountain of spiritual youth eternally
fresh and strong.
It is as strange now to reflect
that to the foolish conservatives of
four hundred years ago the classics
were an intolerable innovation, as
it is to think that Huxley and his
compeers had to contend so long
and so hard for the claims of sci
ence to recognition as a force for
culture in a modern education.
And now that the educational
sceptre has passed from classics to
science, and the scientific spirit
dominates every sphere, its more
radical advocates would crowd
entirely out of the field its most
formidable rival, the time-honored
humanistic culture, as having no
place whatever in an up-to-date
education. The pendulum hits
once more swung as far as it can
go. That spirit of science which
is intolerant, whether it is philo
logical science that inveighs against
natural science or natural science
that will allow no place to philo
logical science, is the primal cause
of the violent reactions that come
in the lines of education; that
readiness for revulsion is one of
the things that argue most potently
for the final triumph of breadth.
Intolerance is the child of narrow
ness of spirit; and when we all
dwell together in harmony, each
recognizing the value of all lines
of culture, breadth is assured.
And if Mr. King is right in
his estimate of the purely scientific
mind unbalanced by those mental

pursuits that feed the fancy, en
noble the sentiments, enable us to
enjoy beauty and harmony —and
the ardent advocate of the human
ities is easily persuaded to believe
him —then there is sure to come
against the technical scientific
education so fashionable in our
day a reaction strong enough to
bring about a tremendous revival
of the humanities, in the most
comprehensive sense of the word;
or, if a compromise can be effected,
it may at last stop the swinging
pendulum in'the middle and pro
duce the harmonious blending of
the two cultures that will give us
the full liberal education for which
this plea is made.
With a well-balanced education,
that antiquated narrow contempt
of the new education for the old
will he entirely forgotten. Then
in the eyes of the scientist the
humanist will 110 longer be a man
who can not '"see beyond the horizon
of his own shallow experience, and
who from his self-constructed
throne judges the rest of mankind
with the complacent assurance born
of a fancied superiority." Nor will
the humanist find in this promised
land so many Philistines —"full of
narrowness, full of prejudices, with
a defective type of religion, a nar
row range of intellect and knowl
edge, a stunted sense of beauty, a
low standard of manners, arid
averse, moreover, to whatever may
disturb it in its vulgarity " With
this breadth of intellectual culture,
and the physical culture that our
human nature demands and de
serves, our youth may with joy
enter into their six-fold inher
itance, physical, scientific, literary,
aesthetic, political, and religious,
which is their indisputable birth
right; and thus equipped they may
transmit it preserved and, in some
chosen field, enriched, to genera
tions yet to come. Lame, at least,
is the institution of learning that
withholds from its students any
one of the six.
The world's call is for the man
of learning who knows better than
any one elst how to do some one
thing; but he cannot meet the re
quirements if he knows nothing
but that one thing; he must know
it in its relation to other things; he
must see things in their proper
proportion. "What science and
practical life alike need," says
Professor Butler, "is not narrow
men, but broad men sharpened to a
point."
Let our new education be not a
vertical line, but a pyramid, of
which our present undergraduate
courses shall furnish the base large
and broad and solid; and let the
university of the future, and, until
it is realized, the graduate depart
ments of the present, supply the
apex. It may cost many a reluc
tant sacrifice of intellectual plea
sures as the narrowing process
begins and many more as it con
tinues. It may be painful, but it
is necessary. For in this day of
specialization only the specialist
can work out the best that is in
him and render back to society
what it has done for him. The
first law of the fullest perfection
says: He perfect; that is, cultivate
all your powers completely and
uniformly—as far as possible. And
the second law is like unto it:
Forward in some respect the per
fection of the race, which has made
your culture possible. And both
may lie included in the law of all
study: Learn only that you may
yourself create. For only through
this divine power of creation is any
one really man; without it he is
only a tolerably clever machine.

It is the business of every scholar
to do something to extend the
domains of knowledge in at least
some one direction, lie can not
afford all his life long to cultivate
nature and knowledge 011 all sides;
one life would never sullice even
to acquire a knowledge of what
the past has done in many depart
ments of thought and what is yet
to be done; and so that life and
its powers would be lost to the
world to which they should have
been consecrate. To some it may
lie painful to think that we must
live on and die and leave many a
wide field of knowledge untraversed
and unknown. This longing to
learn everything is in itself a noble
element of our nature, and leads to
noble results; but it requires to be
checked by the stern voice of duty.
Otherwise we should be living to
self—living off the world's bounty.
The world owes no man anything;
but every man owes the world all
that he has and is, for the growth
of the past has made the possibili
ties of the present. No one has a
right to labor for his own enjoy
ment merely or keep bis education
for his own gratification. Every
true scholar, therefore, must, ac
cording to taste or natural capacity
or previous training, make his
choice of that side of his nature to
which he will give the preference,
and, after the foundation of the
pyramid of his education has been
laid broad and strong, rear the
superstructure, narrowing as it
aspires, llis own culture in its
other departments must be left to
take care of itself. Therein con
sists the higher sacrifice. And the
more useful the scholar's life is to
be, the higher wili be the sacrifice
he must make, and the more he
will have to surrender of that very
culture without which his genius
would have been unstable and
helpless. He lias no choice in the
matter. He must turn his back
upon many an avenue for self
culture opened up to him by nature
in order to devote ail his natural
gifts and all his acquired powers
to the superior development of one
or more capacities.
But for a student to specialize on
one line too early in his career is
to deprive himself of the half of his
soul and shut himself up too early to
a trade. That is technical training,
not education. If professional
training is a benefit, it is so in
greater or less degree according to
the measure of the culture and at
tainment which one brings to such
study. Ail professional training,
all specializing, if it is going 10
accomplish that which is best in
its own sphere, must he built up
like our pyramid, step by step,
upon the foundations of a culture
br ad and deep. And the higher
we build the pyramid of special
knowledge, the broader and deeper
must its foundations have been
laid aid the more carefully must
these have been calculated for that
special superstructure they are to
bear. This is the realm of the
human mind. Without that, law,
medicine, or any other profession
is practically helpless. We can
not take hoys from 1 lie byways and
hedges, teach them to read and
write and do simple sums, then
give them a two or three years'
course in a medical school and ex
pect them to do much for the last
ing betterment of the human race.
Here and there one or two may,
through chance or through some
God-given talent, help somewhat
to that end, but we have no reason
to expect that with the preparation
they have had they will succeed in
doing so. We force into every

profession boys (and girls) from
our lower schools with minds ab
solutely untrained and utterly in
capable of living up to the best
they might, if it were not for our
American weakness of being for
ever in a rush. Our colleges have
made provision for meeting just
this difficulty, but in our overhaste
to get into the struggle for exist
ence that provision is ignored. If
there is any one thing which more
than another distinguishes our
American university from other
universities it is this: that whereas
the German university exists for
the production of scholars, in
vestigators, and the English uni
versity for the production of
clergymen and the polish of young
noblemen, the American university
exists primarily for purposes of
culture —the culture of the common
man. The question of usefulness
or of "practical" value in this
culture stage of higher education is
now, we may happily say, among
educated men but very seldom
raised; or if it is raised, it is only
for the purpose of putting it down
the more effectually. In the pro
duction of culture everything de
pends upon truth; practical utility
(in the vulgar sense) is altogether
a secondary matter, in the truer
sense of the word, anything is
practical that makes a man or a
community or a state or a nation
stronger or better or wiser, any
thing that helps a man to live up
to the best that is in him, to be
true to himself, to bis neighbor,
and to bis God. That is practical
and nothing else is, except as it is
wrought through such a medium.
The scholar's work may bring him
in his daily bread, yes, even
wealth. But that is only inci
dental; it is not the most real nor
the noblest function of his work,
nor even the most practical.
But whatever your education, it
must be returned with proper in
crease tc> the world that gave it to
you. Of what use to your college
or your country or this world, to
whose betterment your best should
be consecrated —of what use to any
body or anything but yourself, is
your education if you become not
the leaders of thought and the
teachers of those who follow to
make up the forces that make for
righteousness and the advancement
of truth? Your first calling is that
you be witnesses of the Truth.
Every scholar, every educated man,
to live out the best of which he is
capable, must be the "living spirit
of knowledge"; he ought to be
morally the best man of his age,
and he must in some way or other
be a teacher, whatever bis other
profession or professions in life;
and "they that be teachers shall
shine as the brightness of the firm
ament, and they that turn many
to righteousaess as the stars for
ever and ever.''
You that have attained so much
of the skill required to overcome
and correct the improper tendencies
of the natural man, to combat
ignorance and vice and build up in
their place knowledge and right
eousness; you that have acquired
so much of culture that you are
ready to be sent forth into the
world to do —to teach and to bless
—remember always that you are
destined to act and react with a
most powerful influence upon hu
manity. Whether the circle of
your influence be wide or narrow,
the culture you have received is to
be extended to others and every
where to lift up our common
brotherhood to a higher plane of
living.
We have made it our highest
aim to contribute to the culture
and elevation of humanity in you
and in all with whom you may
ever have a common point of con
tact. All knowledge and all sci
ence that we may command, which
does not tend to that end, is vain
and worthless. How successful it
shall be in attaining that end has
depended upon the spirit in which
you have received what has been
afforded here and will depend also
upon the spirit and faithfulness
with which you carry further the
lessons of truth you have learned
and upon the increase and trans
mission of the power you have
made your own. You go forth
believing in the ultimate triumph
of the good, with your ideals of
what humanity ought to be; is
humanity up to your ideal? If
not, then you can not be true to
yourself, to your neighbor, or to
your God, if you fail to devote all
your best powers, your best self, to
the elevation of the humanity you
find about you up to the ideals you
cherish for yourselves.
You have your life problems to
face, not alone tbese literary, in
tellectual, and educational prob
lems the proper solution of which
will raise us above the present
''hopeful level of Philistine vulgar
ity" which we are accused of occu
pying, and make us to be leaders
ot the world in things of pure in
tellect as well as in lines of
mechanical application of scientific
principles; that is yours to bring
about; but you have also just
as serious social, economic, and
political problems, and the world
looks to you to solve them. The
questions of finance must be
answered by college men; the rela
tion of capital to labor, the question
of trusts, of marriage and divorce,
and of the reform of municipal
government, the annihilation of
that worst enemy of education and
morals, that legalized destroyer of
men and property —the saloon—
these are grave problems which
call for the application of the best
minds and strongest characters our
colleges can develop.
