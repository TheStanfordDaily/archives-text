# "THE OLD AND THE NEW."
## Commencement Address by Professor Walter Miller.

"The old order changeth, yielding place
to new,
And God fulfills Himself in many ways,
Lest one good custom should corrupt t he
world."
The land in which we live is
called "the New World," and our
individual lot is cast in the newest
part of it. The problems, educa
tional as well as political, which
our country has had to face are,
many of them, new. We have
grown up, as far as we have grown
at all, under the stimulus of condi
tions all our own. We have been
bound by no distant past nor
necessarily hampered by the tradi
tions of the lands from which our
fathers came. Most of our short
national life has so far been an
experiment. What the experiment
will prove will he known when our
young western world has grown to
age. In the meantime all the
civilized world is watching with
eager eyes each new stage of our
experimenting. In our present
state we are generally accused of
being a nation of mediocrity, except
in bulk. One century has seen us
suddenly transformed from three
million subject colonists on the
Atlantic sea-board into a nation of
sixty million sovereign citizens
whose dominions reach from ocean
to ocean. Similarly our culture is
full grown hut immature, like a
boy of sixteen six feet tall. The
like of our system (or want of sys
tem) of education was never seen
nor ever dreamed of before. Our
grammar school may find its
counterpart in the old world; but
our American high school is
neither the English grammar
school nor the German gymnasium
nor the French Lycee. Our Amer
ican college may he the outgrowth
of the Oxford and Cambridge idea
further developed, but the Amer
ican university is not the Englisl
university nor the German univer
sity. It is a mixed product grown
up under new conditions on new
soil.
Europe makes merry over our
481 colleges and universities and
wonders how they all manage to
exist. Never mind Europe; we do
the same ourselves. Hut our col
leges which we count by hundreds
are a necessary link in the evolu
tion of a coming educational system
worthy of our western civilization;
for as they are, they represent and
foster the spirit of our national
life. Every nation must in her
own way show that she has abiding
in her the love of truth; and that
love can best be cherished only in
ways that conform to her own
character and promise the fulfill
ment of her own purposes. In the
development to which we look for
ward, who can say that we have
too many colleges now? They will
rather be found too few. There is
scarcely a community in the length
and breadth of our land that would
not gladly make large sacrifices to
secure in its midst the location of a
promising college and so increase
the present list. When the ideal
of the American university is real
ized and the college of to-day falls
into its natural place as a school of

culture and of preparation for the
higher university of tomorrow, we
shall find that we have after all
too few rather than too many col
leges. Such a result Would be hut
another of history's repetitions.
For the first twelve years of higher
education in Michigan, when uni
versities did not mean much more
in the way of education than high
schools do now, that commonwealth
had no less than nine state colleges.
They all struggled along at starva
tion rates. Hut they were far from
being a menace to society or a
danger to education. For as one
of the nine grew into a university,
the other eight, as was right and
best, fell into their natural place as
preparatory schools of a high order
feeders for the one real univer
sity. And today we regret only
that there had not been more of
those "starveling" colleges to follow
the same course. Now that ideals
have grown upward and expanded,
the same development may take
place to our well-being on the pres
ent higher plane. Our college cur-

riculum lias undergone wondrous
changes in the last '200 years; the
garment that was placed upon the
American college in its infancy has
heen long since outgrown, and the
patterns after which it was cut are
no longer in fashion. The oldest
of our colleges is, in comparison
with Paris and Oxford, as far as
years are concerned, still in its
childhood. And who knows hut
the spirit that planted these 4<Sl
colleges will yet realize its fulfill
ment in the "true idea of a univer
sity''? What will that consumma
tion be?
Our present system (if what we
have may fairly he called a system)
is a development, with the various
additions and other changes that
come with growth, out of the edu
cation of past ages. In order to
determine what the next stage in
its growth will he we must examine
the history of its growth through
the past and the conditions and
tendencies of its present stage.
Our whole modern civilization in
its existent forms, this age of steel
and steam and electricity, with all
its triumphs of applied science in

the creation of great labor-saving
machinery, in rapid transit and the
annihilation of distance and time,
is a wondrous growth, exceeding in
this one century in these particu
lars the sum total of all that pre
vious history has recorded. Hut
follow this marvelous shoot down
ward to the stem and we shall find
that it is after all a graft. "The
same," to use Professor William
Smith's figure, "The same was en
grafted upon the sturdy stem of the
olden culture, a stem that struck
its roots deep into the sacred soil
of Greece and Home, through the
rich accumulated alluvium of
nearly thirty centuries. Into this
graft, this new scion, the generous
sap of the ancient trunk has been
poured abundantly and a pro
digious growth and wonderful
fruitage have resulted."
The art of Greece has been the
inspiration, the wonder, and the
despair of all artists since the day
when the lofty spirit of Hellenic
greatness began to Hag. The
mythology of Greece lias become

the language of symbol among all
civilized peoples of whatever name
and tongue. The poetry, the phil
osophy, the ethics, and the science
as well as the arts of Greece,
illumine every modern classic
page. Says Alfred Baker, professor
of mathematics in Toronto: "If
we should ever think of a people —
a chosen people —who had a mes
sage and a revelation to the world,
that people was the ancient Greeks.
We owe them an incalculable debt
for our knowledge of art, literature,
and science, and of the three our
debt is perhaps greatest for their
legacy of science." Whether con
sciously or unconsciously, we build
upon foundations laid, or at least
after plans drawn, by the great
thinkers —poets, artists, philoso
phers, scientists —of the days when
man was, in both body and intel
lect, at bis best. Even this present
age of scientific education is but
continuing the work where Greece
left off, and without the pioneering
work done by the science of those
old days and without the literature
of Greece upon whose light some men
of science now see tit to turn their

backs, our own science would have
bmt forced to go back to the most
primitive conceptions of nature and
waste centuries in traveling the
roads which the classical thinkers
built through unbroken wilds and
trod for us. Others have labored
and we have entered into their
labors.
If, then, the impression left by
the Hellenic spirit upon our world
of art and letters has l>een so strong
and so abiding, what of our inher
itance of educational ideals from
the same source? And if the
disciple has not been greater than
the master in those expressions of
creative genius, has the master
been surpassed in the business of
educating men and training the
powers in them for the creation of
great ideas and great ideals?
Though ignorance may some
times sneer and "self-complacent
modernism" sometimes assail, yet
one need not be a mere praiser of
the times that are gone to assert
that that age saw, in at least some
strata of society, man at his high
est and best since his creation, both
mentally and physically. "The
theories of the seers stood the test
of application by the men of
deeds." (Butler.) And so it is
our right, and our duty as well to
ask how that condition was real
ized, and why we, with the example
of their successes and their failures
and with the addition of the spirit
that was introduced by way of
Bethlehem and Calvary, can not
attain to that and better than that
by the addition of the moral and
spiritual strength that is ours from
on high.
The problems that the young
Athenians of brains and power had
to face were not so very different
from those which confront the
young American. Their polity
was, as ours is called, a democracy
—a government of the people by
the people. Their youth must,
therefore, be fitted (and so must
ours) not only for good citizenship,
but for the highest duties of citi
zens who are also rulers. Was
their course of training for it dif
ferent from ours? Have we learned
from it all that we can apply with
advantage to our own conditions?
The feature of Athenian educa
tion that has been most overlooked
in the modern was the love of the
beautiful. This was the dominat
ing principle in education, and we
would do well not to leave the
Aesthetic sense longer in neglect.
Hellenic sanity —soundness of body
and of intellect and of all that is
produced by either —is proverbial.
And through it all must run the
golden thread of beauty. As they
developed their language to its
peerless beauty and expressiveness,
as Callicrates and Ictinus reared
their wondrous temples, as Phidias
and Praxiteles carved their statues
and Polygnotus and Apelles spread
their canvases with perfect beauty
and symmetry, so they trained the
intellect and the soul into beauty
and strength, and so they trained
the body with a view to the beauti
ful and strong; and everything
that could tend in the opposite
direction was strictly proscribed.
In general, our universities, high
schools or gymnasia, and common
