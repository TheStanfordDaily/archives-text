# DEDICATION OF THE PLATE.
## Address by Charles M. Mannon. 
### 
Dr. Jordan ami Fellow-Students:
We are assembled here to per
form a fitting ceremony inaugu
rated some two years ago by the
Senior Class of Stanford. It has
become the custom for each suc
ceeding Senior Cla-e to lay in the
pavement of the Quadrangle a
bronze tablet as a memento of those
who are about to leave the Univer
sity and go out int) the world.
The course of time has brought to
the Class of 'US the privilege of
perpetuating this custom, and it is
with pleasure that we present this
plate as a slight token of the
respect in which we hold our Uni
versity. With pleasure—and yet
with pain, for it is one of the last
acts of the Senior Class, and it i* a
reminder that our official connec
tion with the University must soon
cease, although we shall always be
with her in spirit.
The feelings of a Senior have
been often portrayed. His four
years' residence in the University
has endeared it to him beyond
description, and as the time ap
proaches for him to leave it mem
ories of his college life crowd upon
him, and seen through the golden
haze with which events soon to
pass into the history of his life are
invested, they take on an added
charm. With feelingssuch as these
it is but natural that he should
think of some way in which to ex
press them, and this ceremony is
the Stanford's Senior's gratitude

and love for 11is alma mater. Each
bronze square represents the tribute
paid to her by the year's loyal sons
and daughters, and the aggregate is
boundless, immeasurable; the trib
ute paid by each of these tablets is
infinite.
As the student of the far distant
future passes and notes the thread
of {.old in the white and brown of
the pavement, it will remind him
that liis college has a history and a
future; that the four years he
spends here are but a small part of
her existence. The succession of
plates will remind him of the Stan
ford men and women who are scat
tered through this busy world.
Perchance he may find food for
speculation as to what kind of men
and women were students of Stan
ford in the far off ages represented
by the head of the golden line; but
at any rate be will feel himself
bound to them by a tie which is
symbolized It}' a chain of plates.
The student of the future will not
alone feel the influence of the
mystic line. The visitor who may
chance to promenade the arcades
of the Quadrangle will also be im
pressed by the strength of Stanford
influence, for to him the numbei>
will not stand for classes or for
thoughts or deeds of any particular
year, but they will represent to him
the Stanford spirit and will reveal
to him in some slight measure the
work which Stanford University
has been doing for the benefit of
mankind. For these plate- repre
sent the men and women who have
spent four years endeavoring s ■ to

improve themselves as to be able to
help their fellows as well as help
themselves, and though now the
line is short and the number repre
sented by a few, each year a greater
number will be added to it and the
total will swell until the graduates
of Stanford will have a mighty in
fluence in the affairs of ihe nation.
The arches of the Stanford Quad
rangle will lie famous not only over
ihe State of California hut over the
entire world, and her fame will ex
tend down the avenues of time as
this line of plates creeps down tlu
arcade of the Quadrangle.
The Class ot '1)8 has had tin
for.une to attend the University
during a time which was darkest
for the future of the instituti hi,
and we have witnessed during that
time such a display <>112 unselfishness
and unwavering courage as is sel
dom seen. If any one influence of
our University course has had
more effect upon our minds than
another, this should he that influ
ence The example is one which
can not fail to have its effect, and
the memory of it is one which is
most pleasant and which calls for
the greatest gratitude. Our great
indebtedness to the Founders is one
of the foremost though 4 ,s in the
mind of every Senior.
For the Class of '98 this plate is
the expression of the knowledge
of what the University has done
for us, the expression of our loyalty
to Stanford and of our recognition
and gratitude for the bounty which

has made possible our course in the
University. To us the plate will
always be a reminder of the happy
years spent
"Where the red roofs rim the blue,"
and will he the visible tie which
binds us to the University from the
world. In after years we may
chance to visit the campus, and
though each well remembered spot
may bring back ils associations,
when we reach this 'i)<S in the
Quadrangle it will recall t<> us our
t Diversity life as a whole and we
»\ 111 be able to vie a i l in i ■n up re
liensi ve gin lice wh i< h will cii.n It
11s to realize as nevci before wbat
we owe Io our <ilmti m'' .
In fullilliuent of the duty as
signed to me 1 now, in the name of
the Class of 'i)h, present to Stanford
I niver.-ity t hi.- memorial plate as a
token of gratitude for the vast gifts
conferred by her.
