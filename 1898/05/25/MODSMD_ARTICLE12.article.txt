# Commencement Ball.
## 
### 
The annual Commencement Ball
was held Monday evening in the
Encina club room, which had been
transformed for the occasion into
a bower of greens. The hop was
most successful and eighty couples
thoroughly enjoyed themselves
dancing to the sweet music until
the hours grew small. A charm
ing effect was produced after the
electric lights went out by intro
ducing calcium lights which threw
changing colors on the dancers.
