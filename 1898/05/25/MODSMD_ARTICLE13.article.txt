# CLASS DAY ADDRESS.
## Delivered by Professor J.C. Branner. 
### 
To every one of you the question
today is, How am i to succeed in
my business or in my pro
fession? And that is what 1 am
going to tell you.
First of all: lkm't think too
much about getting a place, but
think rather of lilting yourselves
to till one properly.
To be sure u place must he had,
but place is never long wauling to
a thoroughly competent person.
I have had much to do with finding
employment for young men and
women, but the greatest obstacle i
find in the way is their unfitness.
i\ext, when once you find a plate,
the most important thing is for
you to devote yourself to the inter
ests of your employer. If you do not
make up your minds to do this
thing you will not succeed and
you have no right to succeed.
Think then of your employer's
interests; pick np his property and
care for it; save his money for him;
earn just as much more for him
than lie pays you as you can; don't
listen to the voice of envy, of petty
jealousy, such sentiments are small
and en-tmalling; but be loyal tohiui,
take pride in his success, and try
to contribute as much as you can
to it. It' he is not worthy of your
loyalty, then leave him like an
honest man and take with you
your self-respect.
The one general lesson that al
most all young people need to
learn is that what isto be done is
of importance and that it should
be done properly and in season.
And finally: be the makers of
places rather than the seekers after
places.
What a humiliation it must be
for a self-respecting, educated man
to find himself in the position of
what one hears spoken of nowadays
as "'holding down a job."
But don't proceed on the theory
that life is all hard, grinding work.
Don't do anything too much. In
terest yourself in something else
than your business. This is es
pecially important for us Ameri
cans who are disposed to do some
one thing very much too much.
Keep in mind the old maxim, in
medio tvtisximus: that is to say, the
safest place is in the middle; and
this principle ought to be borne in
mind in all ihe iiflairs of lite.
Remember that there are such
things as proprieties in life. Re
spect established customs but don't
worship them. He inflexible in
vour principles and flexible in your
manners, but be careful not to
mistake mam eis for principles or
principles for manners Cultivate
and keep on hand a clean con
science: it wi.ll help keep you in all
the duiies and relations of life.
In nil matters rÂ» member that
eternal vigilance is not on.y ihe
price of liberty, but it is the price
of almost everything in life worth
having.
Last, but not least, to one and
all of you, 1 say: get married as
soon as you can afford to do so,
and so far as possible, marry mem
bers of t he Class of '98. This is the
best and in many respects the
most important piece <>112 advice in
the lot. You know each other's
mental capabilities pretty well and
the members of the Faculty
know that the women in the class
are smarter than the men.
And row, members of the Class
of '98, the day after tomorrow you
go out into the world to meet its
joys and sorrows, its successes and
its' failures. Here with your alma
water you have left the class num-

Iter pp. in ted in big white figures in
the middle of the quadrangle, and
loving memories of your manly and
womanly traits forever in the mid
dle of our hearts.
