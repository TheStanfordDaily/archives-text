# Baccalaureate Sermon.
## 
### 
The baccalaureate services were
held in the chapel Sunday, May
28. After music by the choir, read
ing of scriptures by Dr. Jordan,
and prayer by Dr. Thoburn, Pro
fessor C. E. Markham of Oakland
delivered the address on "The soc
ial conscience" on the text "He
that hath no vision will perish."
The theme was an exposition of
the social conscience of man, which
has for its basis feeling for others
and is manifested in the law of
Christ —disinterested service. Un
less an individual life is merged
into the common good it withers
and perishes. Love of service
should be the motive of all per
sonal ambition and development,
the purpose of education and cul
ture, and the end of all ambitions
and aims. Self-seeking is the
world's practice and faith. Against
this is the doctrine of un selfishness,
of subordination to the public
good—the doctrine of men of great
souls, men of social conscienct.
The law of life is service, and no
one is too great or too small to love
or labor.
