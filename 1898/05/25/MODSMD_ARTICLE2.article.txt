# "LEST WE FORGET!"
## Annual Address by President Jordan to the Members of the Graduating Class. 
### 
Members of the Graduating CUlss of
181)8:
With you and such as you lies
the solution of the problems in the
century to come. This is my justi
fication in speaking to you of the
problems of the day. For this year
of 18 ( ,)8 marks one of the great crises
in our National life. Its stern de
mands are on us though we be yet
unconscious. Before we realize the
importance of the choice, the hour
for choosing shall have passed.
Twice before in the history of our
llepublic has a great crisis come
to us, and each time in the past
has ourchoice been a wise one.
The lirst crisis followed the War
of the Revolution. Its question
was this: What relation shall the
emancipated colonies bear to one
another? Tne answer was the
American Constitution, the federa
tion of self-governing and united
states.
The second crisis came through
the growth of slavery. The union
of the states could not endure half
slave, half free. The emancipation
proclamation of Abraham Lincoln
marked our derision thai the Union
should endure, a nd that all tint
makes for division should be swept
away. ll was not the victory of
the Federal arms which decided
this question, ll was the spirit oi
the American people which decreed
that '■government of the people, for
the people, by the people, should
not perish from the eartli."
The third great crisis is on us
now. The war with Spain is only
a part of it, an incident in the great
movement. The question i- not.
Can we capture Manila, Havana,
I'orto liico, or the Canaries? ll is
not what we take or what we hold.
The American navy and the Amer
ican army can accomplish all we
ask i>f them with time and patience.
Battles are fought today through
engineering and technical skili, not
through personal fearlessness and
dash. The great cannon speaks
the language of science, aid
individual courage is helpless be
fore it. The standing of our naval
officers ii.i matters of engineering is
beyond question. They are all
abreast of the nines. There arc a
hundred nameless lieutenants in
our warships alone who, if oppor
tunity offered, could write their
names beside those of Grenville and
Nelson and Farragut and Dewey.
The glory of Manila is not dim be
side that of Mobile or Trafalgar.
The cool strength and soberness
of Yankee courage added to the
power of naval engineering could
meet any foe on earth on equal
terms, and here the terms are not
equal. Personal fearlessness our
adversaries possess and that is all
they have. I'll a t we have in like
measure. Everything else is on
our side. We train our guns
against the empty shell of a medie
val monarchy, broken, corrupt.
Whether we are right or wrong in
our main contention, we can not
fail to win.
Even now as I speak perhaps the
great guns of Sampson's tleet have
opened the black vaults of Morro
Castle to the sunshine of theCarib
bees. Even so the fair is hind which
Spain has kept so long in darkness
may be opened to the sunlight of
modern civilization.
The war with Spain marks in
itself no crisis. The end is seen
from the beginning. It was known
to Spain as clearly as to us. But
her government had no recourse.
They had come to the end of their

diplomacy and could only die fight
ing. "Whatever else the war may
do," says the Spanish diplomat,
with pathetic honesty, ''it can only
bring ruin to Spain."
Jt is too late for us now to ask
how we got into the war. Was it
inevitable? Was it wise? Was it
righteous? No need to ask these
questions, because the answers will
not help us. We have our doubts
as to one or all of these, but all
doubts we must keep to ourselves.
We are in the midst of battle, must
fight to the end. The rough rid
ers are in the saddle. "What j
though the soldiers knew some
one had blundered." The swifter, (
fiercer, more glorious our attacks,
the sooner and more lasting the
peace. Unless we are able to close
the war at once with a few
strong swift blows, we have no ex
cuse for beginning it.
The crisis conies when the war is
over. What then? Our question

is not, "What will wedo with Cuba,
Porto Rico, ami the Philippines?"
It is, "What will these prizes do to
lis?" Can we let go of them in
honor or in safety? If not, what
if we hold them? What will he
the reflex effect of great victories,
suddenly realized strength, the
patronizing applause, the ill-con
cealed envy of great nations, the
conquest of strange territories, the
raising of our Hag beyond the seas?
All this is new to us. It is un-
American; it is contrary to our tra
ditions; it is delicious; it is intoxi
cating.
Kor this is the fact before us. We
have come to our manhood among
the great nations of the earth.
What shall we do about it? The
war once finished shall we go home
again? Shall we go back to our
farms and factories, to squabbles
over tariffs and coinage, our petty
trading in peanuts and postoMices?
Or shall our country turn away
from these things and stand forth
once for all a great naval power,
our vessels in every sea, our in
fluence felt wherever man's foot
falls on the earth? Shall we be

the plain United States again, or
shall we be another England, fear
less even of our own great mother,
second to her only in age and
prestige?
The minor results of war are
matters of little moment in com
parison. Let us look at a few of
them as we pass. .Most of them
are not results at all. The glow of
battle shows old facts in new rela
tions. The war has stirred the
fires of patriotism, we say. Cer
tainly, but they were there already,
else they could not be stirred.
1 doubt if there is more love of
country with us today than there
was a year ago. Heal love of coun
try is not easily moved. Its guar
antee is its permanence. Love of
adventure, love of light, these are
soon kindled. It is these to which
the battle spirit appeals.
Love of adventure we may not
despise. It is the precious heritage
of new races; it is the basis of per-

sonal courage; but it is not patriot
ism: it is push. Love of light is
not in itself unworthy. The race
which can not light if need be is a
puny folk destined to be the prey
of tyrants. If one needs to light
he should fight for all that is
in him.
Hut one who lights for light's
sake, one who goes into a quarrel
which might be avoided, is a bully,
not a hero. The bully is at heart
a coward. To light only when we
are sure of the result, is no proof of
national courage. Nor is any such
proof necessary for the renown of
America.
Patriotism is the will to serve
one's country; shall we say to make
one's country better worth serving?
It is a course of action rather than
a sentiment. It is serious rather
than stirring. The shrilling of the
mob is not patriotism. It is not
patriotism to trample <>n the Span
ish Hag, to burn firecrackers, or to
twist the lion's tail. The shrieking
of war editors is not patriotism
Nowadays nations buy newspapers
as they buy ships. Whatever is
noisv, whether in Congress or the

I»u 1 ]»it, can not be patriotism. It
is not in the galleries that we find
brave men. ''Patriotism," says
Dr. Johnson, "is the last refuge of
the scoundrel." Hut he was speak
ing of counterfeit patriotism.
There could not be a counterfeit
were there not also a reality.
But this L see as i watch the
situation, —true patriotism declines
as the war spirit rises. Men say
they have no interest in reform
until the war is over. There is no
use of talking of better financial
methods, of fairer adjustments of
tuxes, of wiser administration of
affairs, until the war fever has
passed by. The patriotism of the
hour looks to a fight with some
other nation, not towards greater
pride in our own.
But we say the war has
united at last the North and the
South. So at least it appears.
When Fitzhugh Lee is called a
Yankee, and all the haughty Lees
seem proud of the designation, we
may be sure that the old lines of
division exist no longer. North
and South, Last and West, whatever
our blood, birth or rank, we Yan
kees stand shoulder to shoulder in
1898. But our solidarity today
shows that the nation was sound
already, else a month could not
have welded it together.
It is twenty-eight years ago to
day that a rebel soldier who
"Loved tlu; South and dared for her
To tight from Lookout to the sea
With her proud banner over me,"
stood before the ranks of the Grand
Army and spoke these words:
" I stand and say that you were right;
I greet you with uncovered head,
Remembering many a thundrous tight,
When whistling death between us
«lied;
I clasp the hand that made my scars,
I cheer the Hag my fomnen bore,
I shout for joy to see the stars
All on our common shield once
more."
This was more than a quarter of
a century ago and all this time the
great loyal South has patiently and
unflinchingly accepted war's terrible
results. It is not strange then that
she shows her loyalty today. The
Solid South, that bugaboo of politi
cians, the cloak of Northern
venality, lias passed away forever.
The warm response to American
courage, in whatever section or
party, in whatever trade or profes
sion, shows that with all our sur
face divisions we of America are
one in heart, one in all essentials.
The impartial bitterness of Spanish
hatred, directed toward all classes
and conditions of Anglo-Saxons,
alike emphasizes the real unity of
race and nation.
There are some who justify war
for war's sake. Blood-letting "re
lieves the pressure on the bounda
ries."' It whets courage. Jt keeps
the ape and tiger alive in men.
All this is detestable. To waste
good blood is pure loss and murder,
if nothing is gained by it. To let
blood for blood's sake is bad in
politics as it is bad in medicine.
War is killing—brutal, barbarous
killing —and its direct effects are
mostly evil. The glory of war
turns our attention from civic
affairs. Neglect invites corruption.
Noble and necessary as was our
Civil War, we have not yet recov
ered from its degrading influences.
Too often the courage of brave
men is an excuse for the depreda
tions of venal politicians, and the
glorious banner of freedom becomes
the cover for the sutler's tent.
The test of civilization is the
substitution of law for war,statutes
for brute strength. There are not
many really civilized nations yet;
but of this we may be sure, not
often will two of them full into war


PRESIDENT DAVID STARR JORDAN
with each other. For if both are
civilized, they will find other re
sources than those of battle. No
doubt diplomacy, as one of our
senators has said, is mostly "a
pack of lies," and arbitration, as
we have known it, is compulsory
and arbitrary compromise. But in
the long run diplomacy brings out
the truth it would conceal. Truth
will out, even in diplomacy. The
nations who suffer through clumsy
and blundering tribunals of arbi
tration will learn from this experi
ence. They will find means to
secure justice as well as peace. As
private war gave way to security
under national war, so must public
war give way to the law of civiliza
tion.
I hear men say today that war is
necessary to the Republic because
we need new heroes for our wor
ship. The old heroes are getting
stale. Those of the Revolution are
half mythical. Washington and
Greene were never actually alive in
real Hesh and blood. Even Grant
and Sherman, Lee and Jackson.
Thomas and Farragut are names
only to most of us. Our fathers
knew them, but theirs are not
names to conjure with today. So
the name of Dewey fills a great
want. The heroes of the news
paper in times of peace are mere
tin pel heroes. Here is one with
flesh and blood in him, a man of
nerve and courage and success.
All this is true, but we do not
need war for the making of heroes.
They were ready for heroism in
times of peace. The real hero is
the man who does his duty. It
does not matter whether his name
be on the headlines of the news
paper or not. Jt is the business of
the Republic to make a nation of
heroes. The making of brave
soldiers is only a part of the work
of making men. The glare of
battle shows men in false per
spective. To the one who stands
in its light we give the glory that
belongs to a thousand.
But we may shout with the rest
as the great captains pass before
us. They ha.ve earned their re
nown, but when ''the tumult and
the shouting dies" still the crisis
remains. What shall the war d >
with us?
Our line of action seems a nar
row one. Our policy has been fully
declared. Our armies shall invade
Cuba to put an end to disorder,
brutality, and murderous wrong.
This fair island lies at our gates.
It has been subjected to all the
cruelty the Middle Ages knew how
to inflict. By long continued dis
order our own interests are injured,
our own sympathies most deeply
touched. In the words of the reso
lution of Congress:
The abhorrent conditions which have
existed for more than three years in tlie
island of Cuha, so near our own borders,
have shocked the moral sense of Un
people of the United States, have been
a disgrace to Christian civilization, and
can not longer be endured.
And in recording the necessity
which forces us to act we disclaim
all selfish intentions. In so doing
our Congress used these words,
which are already part of the re
cord of history:
The United States hereby disclaims
any disposition or intention to exercise
sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over
said islands except for the pacification
thereof, and asserts its determination
when that is accomplished to leave the
government and control of the island to
its people.
These wrongs we would avenge
are not new to Spain. By such
gross cruelties she has always held
her provinces in check. Bv such
means she has lost most of them —
Flanders, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela.
Chile, Cuba—all tell the same

story. Spain still belongs to the
17th century. From the 17th cen
tury her colonies ha veescaped. To
them as they throw off the yoke
we shall bring order and relief.
Their shackles once broken, then
we shall stay our hand. To Cuba
Libre, independent and free, we
shall leave the choice of her own
future.
Hut this is easier said than done,
for Cuba Libre has no heart or will
to choose. Its present nominal
government is not that of a repub
lic. Jt is a political oligarchy,
which has its seat not in Cuba but
in New York. Cuba is helpless
now. As a republic she will be
helpless still. Spanish blood and
Spanish training illy prepare a
land for freedom. Freedom such
as we know it has never yet come
to people of Latin blood.
The freedom of Spanish America
is for the most part military des
potism. Jt is said of the govern
ment of Russia that it is •'despotism
tempered by assassination." That
of most of our sister republics is
assassination tempered by despot
ism. Mexico, the best of them, is
not a republic, it is a despotism
— the tyranny of a man strong and
wise, wiio knows Mexico and how
to govern her, a humane and bene
ficent tyrant.
There are noble men in Cuba,
men of education and character,
with the instincts and bearing of
gentlemen. Some of these I know
and one for years I was proud to call
my friend, Felipe Poey, during
titty years professor in the Univer
sity of Havana. Most men of cul
ture in Cuba hope for Cuba's
freedom. But the population of
Cuba as a whole is ignorant, weak
and vicious.
"The Cuban soldiers at Tampa,"
says John R. Rathom, '"are very
small, excitable, erratic, physically
unfit. They go about the camps
brandishing their machetes and
telling our infantrymen who tower
above them like giants how they
are going to cut the Spaniards to
pieces. Their whole spirit is one
of frothy boasting.
There are three things insep
arable from the life of the Cuban
people today, the cigarette, the lot
tery ticke f ,and the machete. These
stand for vice, superstition, and re
ve.ige. Above these the thoughts
of the common man in Cuba seldom
rise. Most of them can not read
and those who can read only the
literature of vice.
Of my own visit to Havana two
keen recollections remain, in the
early morning the markets are
tilled by a long procession of
loaded burros that come down from
the mountain side. These bring
everything that is eatable, among
other articles live pigs and sheep
Pigs and sheep alike are tied in
pairs and hung saddle-wise, head
downward, from the back of the
donkeys. From two until tour in
ihe morning the long procession
comes in, the pigs lustily squeal
ing, the sheep helpless and dumb.
But nobody cares for an animal's
pain. There is no ''society for pre
vention of cruelty to animals" in
Cuba. There are not many who
could understand even the purpose
of such a society.
In Havana bull fights follow the
church services—bull fights which
are not fights but slaughter. A
horse lame and blind is ripped up
by an infuriated bull, who in turn
is done to death by the stab of a
skillful butcher.
At Christmas time all interest
centers in the lottery. Everybody
buys lottery tickets. Charms,
fortune tellers, astrology, and all
the machinery of superstition is

brought into play to select Ifehe
lucky numbers. How many days
old am 1? How many days old is
my Dolores? How many days old
was I. on my lucky day when I
drew the prize last year? How
can I find my lucky number?
These matters are talked of every
where, on the streets, in the church,
in the wine rooms, in the theatres
One hears the parrots on theii
posts at the gate discussing th>
very same questions. The bird
rattle of the names and number
as gliblv as their masters, and with
as high a conception of the possi
hilities of life.
It seems probable that most of
the oppressed people crowded from
their homes by Weyler's armies
will be dead before we come to
their relief. Indeed, in the process
of starving out Havana we shall
doubtless starve them first. Those
who survive may become our hii
terest enemies before the year is
out. For there people prefer the
indolence of Spanish rule, with all
its brutalities, to the bustling
ways of the Anglo-Saxons. Most
of them would take their chances
of being starved or butchered
rather than to build roads, wash
their faces, or to clean up their
towns. To suppress the lottery
and the cock light, would be to rob
them of all that makes life worth
living. The Puritan Sabbath and
the self-control it typifies in their
eyes would be worse than the
flames of purgatory. Whether as a
free nation under our protection or
whether governed by our martial
law, it would be no easy task to
hold the peace in Cuba Jjibre.
But we may say, and truthfully,
that American enterprise will
change all this. It will How into
Cuba when Cuba is free. It will
clean up the cities, stamp out the
fever, build roads where the mule
paths are and railroads where the
current of traffic goes. It will
make ''the pearl of the Antilles"
what Nature meant her to be, the
fairest island on the face of the
earth.
No doubt all this will come if
we give a stab.e government.
Whatever else we say or do we
must give such a government. Our
duty can not end with the making
of one more black republic. The
nations of the world will hold us
responsible for Cuba through the
years to come. A virtual serfdom
under American martial law is the
fate of Cuba, th nigh we may de
cla e-her free and independent.
Why then shall we not hold Cuba
if she becomes ours by conquest?
Because that would be a cowardly
thing to do. The justification ol
her capture is that we do not want
her. if we want Cuba, common
decency savs that we must let her
alone. Ours is a war of mercy,
not of conquest. This we have
plainly declared to all nations and
we meant what we said. If we re
tire with clean hands, it must be
because our hands are empty. To
keep Cuba would be to do as con
quering nations have done Jin the
past —perhaps to do as England
would do if she were in our place.
Professor Nicholson of Edinburgh
has said: "There can be no ques
tion, in the light of history, that
the political instinct of the English
people—or to adopt the popular
language of the moment, the ori
ginal sin of thenation —is to covet
everything of its neighbors worth
coveting, and it is not content un
til the sin is complete."
Is this true of America likewise?
This we shall see. By a war fo
conquest fifty years ago we took
from Mexico her fairest provinces.
For the good of humanity we did

it, no doubt, and along the lines of
manifest destiny. Brave battles
our soldiers fought, but for all
that, the war itself was most in
glorious. So it reads in the his
tory as we write it today, it is
iniquitous in the history written in
Mexico.
Shall then the war for Cuba
Libre reach an inglorious end? if
\e make anything by it, it will be
nost inglorious. it will be without
ionor if its two millions a day is
nade good by conquered territory.
v\'e must ask for neither land nor
money as indemnity. Neither for
conquest nor for revenge have we
sent forth the army of the liepub
lic. If the war is to lie glorious,
not to the army and navy alone,
l>ut to the nation herself behind
them, there is but one tiling to do.
"Let us beware," says J. K. H. Burg
win, "of placing ourselves in the
position of doing a noble and gen
erous act and then demand that a
bankrupt and humbled enemy pay
our expenses." If we are going to
hold the results of war or to use
them in thrifty trade we should
never have set out on the errands
of humanity.
The nations of Europe look with
jealousy on our possibilities of
strength. "If I only," some king
may say —"if i only had all
these men, all this land, all these
resources, I would eclipse the glory
of Caesar, of Charlemagne, of Na
poleon." If we turned everything
into lighting, whata tight we would
make! But we have gone about
our business, a vast nation of com
mon people, careless of European
complications, indifferent to Euro
pean glory, unconscious of our
power.
For the end of government by
the people is to tit the people to
control their own affairs. The
basis of our government is the
town meeting. The people manage
their local business, and send their
wisest men as delegates to look
after the interests of the nation.
This was the dream of the fathers.
If there has been much change and
some degeneration, yet in substance
the thoughts of the fathers pre
vail. The liberties of the people
are secure because they are every
where in the people's hands.
America is not a power among the
nations. A power is a nation
which is concerned with affa rs not
her ow and which develops the
machinery to make such concern
effective.
The spirit of our foreign policy
has been to avoid all display of
power.
The America of whirl) Washing
ton dreamed should grow strong
within herself, should avoid en
tangling alliances with foreign na
tions, should keep out of all fights
and all friendships that are not
her own, should secure no territory
that might not he self-governing,
and should acquire no provinces
that might not be numbered among
the united states.
To this policy his followers close
ly adhered. Even gratitude to
France never made us her catspaw
in her struggle against England.
No outflow of sympathy has caused
us to interfere in behalf of Ireland
or Armenia or Greece.
But the world is smaller than in
Washington's day. Steam and
electricity have bound the world to
gether. The interests of one na
tion are with all nations. The in
terests of Armenia, Cape Colony,
and Ceylon are closer to us today
than the interests of France and
Germany were to our fathers. Tra
ditions are worthy of respect only
when they serve the real needs of
today, So it may be that with
changed conditions this wise coun
sel of the past may be open to re
vision. Are times not already
ripe for a change in national
policy?
Let us look for a moment at the
policy of England. The United
States is great through minding
her own business; England through
minding the business of the world.
In Norse mythology the Mitgard
Serpent appears in the guise of a
cat. It is weak in appearance,but its
body passes around the world, its
tail growing down its own throat
and by its mighty strength it holds
the world together.
Such is England —a little nation
in the corner of a small continent,
whose influence girds the world
and binds it together —the Mitgard
Serpent of the nations, the assignee
of bankrupt lands, the police force
of disorderly ones, By the powei
of her will and brains she has
made this an Anglo-Saxon planet.
No other agency of civilization
has been so potent as England's
enlightened selfishness. Her col
onies are of two orders —friendly
nations and military posts. The
friendly nations are little united
states. Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, and the rest, rule theii
own aflairs absolutely, asking no
help or advice from the mother
land, to whom they are bound onl\
by the chains of mutual sympathy
and unbroken peace. I'he military
post.- are England's own. The\
are ruled by a rod of iron becaust
no other rule is possible with the
slave nations of the East. Even
year Kngland establishes new
posts, opens new ports, and widens
the strength of her empire.
Hut of all this England herself
is but a little part, the head and
heart of the world-wide organism.
' What does he know of England
who only England knows." No
doubt as Kipling says, England
"thinks her empire still
Twixt the Strand and Hoi horn Hill,"
but the Strand would be half
empty were it not that it leads
outwards to Cathay, and the huge
business of England is the guar
antee of her solidity. All her di
visions must keep together because
they are parts of one great organ
ism, and America stands morally
in the same relation. Greater Eng
land holds over us the obligations
of blood and thought and language
and character. Only the Saxon
understands the Saxon. Only the
Saxon knows the meaning of free
dom. "A sanction like that of re
ligion," says John Hay, "enforces
our partnership in all important
affairs." Not that we should enter
into formal alliance with England.
When England suggests that it is
well for us to ask what we
have to gain. Never yet did
England offer us the hand in
open friendliness, in pure good
faith, hoping for no greater advan
tages, no return. But war with
England should'be forever impos
sible. The needs of the common
race are greater than the needs of
the nations. The Anglo-Saxon
race must be at peace within itself.
It is too tenacious of purpose to
take the self-destroying chances of
war. A war between England and
America fought to the bitter end

tivities lias not I.tin parallel with
hers. We were estranged in the
bejni i g, an I we have had other
affairs on our hands. We have

turned our faces westward. We
found enough to do and our work
has made us strong. We have
had our forests to clear, our
prairies to break, our rivers to
harness, our deserts to cross, our
own problem of slavery to adjust.
We have followed the spirit of
Washington's address for a hundred
years, until the niovementof history
has brought us to the parting of the
ways. Shall we be henceforth a
power in the broad world as Eng
land is, or are we forever only our
own United States?
In the direction of imperialism
we havealready taken certain steps.
The promulgation of the Monroe
Doctrine is one of these. Its origi
nal impulse was a jealous regard
for the liberties of the republics of
Latin America. We make no ob
jection to the present occupation of
parts of America by European pow
ers, but we shall prevent by force
any extension of such dominion.
The course of the Monroe Doctrine
was the danger to Republicanism
through monarchical aggression.
\Vith the republics of America our
interests were supposed to be in
unison. But our real interests lie
now in other directions. We have
a thousand ties to bind us to
Europe for one to Latin America,
illven Japan and China are more
t o us than all the states of South
America. Moreover, the republics
*\e would guard are really only
republics in name. They have no
more of a republican spirit than
nas Italy or Spain, and vastly less
than England or Germany. The
aggressions of England on Vene
zuela which our strong protest pre
vented were really in the interests
of civilization. These republics
nate the United States, her people,
and her institutions. They resent
our protection and repel our patron
age; and in our turn we recognize
that a strong hand like that of
England is necessary to save some
of tliem from barbarism.
So the Monroe Doctrine is not
alone a willingness to aid our sister
republics in their struggle for
freedom. It must become a means
of holding them in order; and
so long as the Monroe Doctrine
is put forth, so long will we be
surety for the good behavior of
Soutn America. This has carried
us away from our traditional atten
tion to our own affairs. It will
carry us still further unless the
policy be reversed.
With a colonial bureau like that
of England, the problems of ruling
an inferior and dependent people
would be simple enough. Such a
bureau could take care of Alaska
and could give good government to
any territory over which our flag
may float. Such a bureau we must
have if Alaska is not to remain a
matter of public embarrassment.
Such a bureau could operate Hawaii
as well. Hawaii can not govern
itself by our federal forms, but
under colonial management it
would be rich and prosperous. The
more it had to do the more impor
tant such a colonial bureau would
become and the wider the extent of
its influence. Every governmental
department tends to aggrandize
itself Colonies would demand
more colonies. If we hive Alaska
already and are certain to take
Hawaii, why not establish such a
colonial bureau and mai age tliem
as EnjJalid manages Hong Kong
aid Singapore and Jamaica. In
ilie .-ame way we may control Culm,
which i- uibiiig as ;i ripe pear into
our ha ids And I'orto Rico must
go with Cuba. The Philippines
may not be too far away. They
are nearer to San Francisco than

Boston was to Philadelphia in the
times of Washington, and the
transfer of news is a matter of
a few hours only. The Philip
pines are as large as New England
and New York, with a population
greater than all the Kooky Moun
tain country and Pacific Slope com
bined. It has a hard population
to manage, a substratum of Kana
kas and Malays lazy and revenge
ful, over these a social layer of
thrifty Chineseand canny Japanese,
th•• next a Spanish aristocracy and
a surface scum of the wanderers of
all the world. In the unexplored
interiors of the great islands live
the wild tribes of negritos, untamed
black imps as incapable of self
government or any other govern
ment as so many monkeys. Spain
has only stood at the gateway of this
rich land and taken toll of what
ever goes out. We could not do
much more, but whatever civiliza
tion can accomplish here, we can
do as well as any one else. If we
do not keep the Philippines they
will fall into worse hands.
All these territories are today
virtually under the American Hay.
Hut why stop here? One great
need of the world's commerce is a
canal across the territory of Nica
ragua, and we may seize the turbu
lent little republic as a guarantee
to the security and neutrality of
the canal. Then Costa Rica has
her coffee fields, and there is won
drous wealth in Guatemala. The
Caroline Islands would make good
coaling stations. We have literary
interest in Samoa at least, and an
open port of our own on the coast
of China would give our commerce
its proper level of equality. Per
haps Swatow would suffice for us
after Russia and Germany and
France and England has each
made its choice.
There are the Blue Canaries, and
from the tall peak of Teneriffe we
can overlook the entrance to the
Mediterranean and keep our watch
on the politics of Europe. As
England is the assignee of bank
rupt Egypt, shall we not seize the
assets of bankrupt Spain?
All this and more, according to
Theodore Roosevelt, is our "mani
fest destiny," and a host of others
are saying the same thing in differ
ent language. The spell is on us
and its force is more irresistible be
cause it came not at our bidding.
Recently in an address in Boston,
Richard Olney, one of the wisest of
our public men, who checked the
bold, bad British Lion by a bluff as
strong as its own, made a vigorous
plea for national expansion—the
dream of American imperialism.
The prizes lie in our hands unbid
den. The fates have forced them
upon us. But before we seize them
let us ask what they will cost?
First it will cost life and money in
rich measure. Kipling tells us the
cost of English admiralty, and
American dominion is bought on
no cheaper terms.
"We have fed our sea for a thousand
years,
And she calls us still unfed,
Though there's never a wave of all her
waves
But marks our English dead.
We've strewed our bent to the weeds
unrest,
To the shark and the sheering gull;
If blood be the price of admiralty
Lo.d God! we have paid it in full."
Each day three sailors lose their
lives from some ship under the
British Hag. And England pays
for these ships. If we have a navy
that like hers can make history we
too must pay for i•, you and I and
the rest of us. and pay it in cold,
hard cash.
This nmins more taxes, heavy

taxes, more expenditure?, more
waste. It means the revision of
our tax laws, a tariff for revenue
only with every element of pro
tection for American industries
squeezed out of them. The Gov
ernment will need all it can get.
We must manage our colonies that
they may yield reve ue. We must
cherish commerce as we have tried
to cherish manufacture, and we
must cherish manufacture and
agriculture through commerce.
Much more of a navy we need to
save ourselves from imbecility.
One victory like that of Manila
may save us from a dozen insults,
and we must have the means to
win such victories.
Ho far this would not he unmixed
evil, perhaps no evil at all. But
we must go farther. Imperialism
demands the maintenance of a
standing army large enough to
carry out whatever we undertake.
We must wholly change our pen
sion laws and deal with the veteran
on a basis of business, not of senti
ment. To maintain these strong
armies the nations of continental
Europe sacrifice everything else,
rhe people are loaded with armor
till they can not rise, and they dare
not throw it off. Almost every
man in Italy is a priest or a soldier,
and the fanner pays for both.
The whole world must become
the range of interest. We mint
make every American's house his
castle troin Kamchatka to Ker
guelen. We must be quick to
revenge and strong to bluff. We
must never tight when the issue is
doubtful, and never fail to tight if
there is a point to be gained. We
must give up our foolish notions of
a separate basis of coinage, a free
man's scale of wages, a peculiar
social order for America different
from that of the rest of mankind.
We must open our own doors as
we would open the door of the
world. We must change the char
acter of our diplomacy. We must
make statecraft a profession.
Hitherto we have sent out our em
bassadors because it is the fashion
among nations, not because we
have anything for them to do.
Hereafter they must go out to
spread American influences. The
plain, blunt, effective truth telling
of our present diplomacy must
give way to the power to carry our
point. We must not send men to
foreign countries because we do not
want them at home. The dull in
competence of our consular service
must give way to a system of
trained agents. And this, too,
has its compensating reactions.
As our foreign service is made
effective it will become dignified.
This will help our relations abroad,
because foreign nations judge us
by the dignity of our representa
tives.
Our Government must be changed
for our changing needs. We must
give up the checks and balances in
our Constitution. It is said that
our great battle-ship Oregon can
turn about end for end within her
own length. The dominant nation
must have the same power. She
must be capable of reversing her
action in a minute, of turning
around within her own length.
This "our prate of statute and of
state" makes impossible. We shall
receive many hard knocks before
we reach this condition, but we
must reach it if we are to work
mighty affairs of the world. If we
are to deal with the crises in foreign
affairs we must meet them not as
we have meet the Cuban question.
We can not move accurately and
quickly under the joint leadership
of a conservative and steady headed
President, a hysterical or venal
Senate, and a Honse intent on its
own re-election. That kink of
checks and balances we must lay
aside forever. As matters are now
President, Senate, and House check
each other's movements, and the
state falls over its own feet.
The Government of the United
States is the expression of the tran
sient will of the people, so hemmed
in by checks an I balances thai
hasty action is impossible, and its
even tenor goes, whatever the will
of the majority .'or the moment
may be. This is the Government
for peace and self-defense, but not
for aggression.
The Government of England ex
presses the permanent will of the
intelligent people with such checks
as shut out ignorance and control
incompetence. The nation and not
the individual man io the unit in
its actions.
Towards the English system we
must approach more and more
closely if we are to deal with for
eign "affairs. The town meeting
idea must give way to centraliza
tion of power. We must look away
from our own affairs, neglect them
if vou please, until the pressure of
growing expenditure forces us to
attend to them again, and to .-ittend
to them more carefully than we
ever yet have done. Good govern
ment at home must precede good
government of dependencies. One
reason England is governed so well
is that misgovernment anywhere
on a large scale would be fatal to
her credit and fatal to her power.
She must call her best men to her
political service, because without
them she would perish. A:ul by
the will of her best politicians her
public affairs must be guarded.
It may be that the choice of im
perialism is already made, if so,
we shall learn the lesson of domin
ion in the hardest school of exper
ience That we shall learn it 1
have no doubt, for ours is a nation
of apt scholars. We shall hold our
own in war and diplomacy, we
shall tie the hands of turbulent na
tions and seize the assets of bank
rupt ones, and we shall teach the
art of money-making to the de
pendent nations who shall be our
wards and slaves. Hut we can not
teach them to take care of them
selves in our democratic fashion.
Some great changes in our sys
tem are inevitable, and belong to
the course of natu.al progress.
Against them 1 have nothing to
say. Whatever our part in the af
fairs of the world, we should play
it manfully.
But with all this I believe that
the movement toward broad do
minion would be a step downward.
It would be to turn from our high
est purposes to drift with the cur
rent of manifest destiny. It would
not be to do the work of America,
but to follow the ways of the rest
of the world. I make no plea for
indifference or self-suffering or iso
lation for isolation's sake. To shrink
from world movements or to drift
with their current, each is alike un
worthy of our origin and destiny.
Only this I urge, let our choice be
made with open eyes, not at the
dictates of chance, disguised as
"manifest destiny"; unforgetting,
open-eyed, counting all the cost, let
us make our decision. Let ours
be sober, fearless, prayerful choice.
The federal republic, the imperia*.
republic, which shall it be? My
reasons are three, and I state each
in a word —first: dominion is brute
force; second: dependent nations
are slave nations; third: the making
of men is greater than the building
of nations.

As to the first of these: The ex
tension of dominion rests on the
strength of arms. Men who can
not hold town meetings must obey
through brute force. In Alaska,
for example, our occupation is a
farce and scandal. Only force can
make it otherwise. Only by force
can the masses of Hawaii or Cuba
he held to industry and order. To
furnish such power, we shall need
a colonial bureau, with its force of
extra-national police. A large
army and navy must justify itself
by doing something. Army and
navy we must maintain for our
own defence, but beyond that they
can do little that does not hurt,
and they must be used if they
would be kept alive. Even war for
humanity falls to the level of other
wars, and all wars according to
Benjamin Franklin are bad, some
worse than others. The rescue of
the oppressed is only accomplished
by using greater force on the op
pressor. The lolly purposes of hu
manity are forgotten in the joy of
struggle and the pride of conquest.
The other reasons concern the
integrity of the Republic itself.
The lesson of slavery was this:
the republic can not exist half
slave and half free. The republics
of antiquity fell because they were
republics of free men only, and
each citizen rested on the backs of
nine slaves. A republic can not be
an oligarchy as well. The slaves
destroy the republic. Wherever we
have inferior and dependent races
within our borders today, we have
a political problem —the Negro
problem, the Chinese problem, the
Indian problem. These problems
we slowly solve. Industrial train
ing and industrial pride make a
man of the Negro. Industrial in
terest may even make a man of the
Chinaman, and the Indian dis
appears as our civilization touches
him.
But in the tropics such problems
are perennial and insoluble. Cuba,
Manila, Nicaragua, will be slave
territories for centuries to come.
Self-government in the Anglo-
Saxon sense can never come in this
climate, to these people. Whatever
form of control we adopt we shall
be in fact slave-drivers, and the
business of slave-driving will react
upon us. Can an imperial republic
last, part slave, part free?
But England endures, and her
control of slave territories is her
pride and our envy. What then
of British imperialism?
England is not a republic in the
same sense. Her function is not
self-government, but the direction
of commerce. It is admiralty rather
than democracy. Americans govern
themselves. Englishmen are ruled
by their government. Englishmen
govern themselves in municipal af
fairs, and in ways from which we
have much to learn. In foreign af
fairs their huire governmental
machine, backed by a.l the mo
mentum of tradition, is all-power
ful. This rules Ireland, India,
Gibralter, Egypt, all England's
dependencies and wards. The
other colonies are republics in fact.
Canada. New Zealand, the states
of Australia—these are republics
bound to keep the peace with the
mother country, but in no other
way controlled by her. Only ties
of sentiment bind Canada to Eng
land In all practical matters she
is one with the United States.
The stronger the governmental
machine, and the more adjustable
its powers, the better the govern
ment. But government is not the
main business of a republic. If
good government was all, demo
cracy would not deserve half the

effort that is spent upon it. For
the function of democracy is not to
make government It is to
make men strong. Better govern
ment than any republic has yet en
joyed could be had in simpler and
cheaper ways. The automatic
scheme of competitive examination
would give us better service at hall
the present cost. Even an ordi
nary intelligence otlice or states
man's employment bureau would
serve us better than conventions
and elections. Government too
good as well as too bad may have
a baneful influence on men. The
purpose of self-government is to
intensify individual responsibility,
to promote attempts at wisdom,
through which true wisdom may
come at last. The republic is a
huge laboratory in whijh strange
experiments are performed, but by
which, as in other laboratories, wis
dom may arise from experience,
and once arisen may work itself out
into virtue.
It is noi true thai the government
'"which is best administered is
best." That is the maxim of tyr
anny. That government is best
which makes the best men. In
the training for manhood lies the
certain pledge of better government
in the future. The civic problems
of the future will be greater than
those of the past. They will con
cern not the relation of nation to
nation, but of man to man. The
policing of far-off islands, the main
tenance of the machinery of im
perialism, are petty things beside
the duties which the higher freedom
demands. To turn to these empty
and showy affairs is to neglect our
own business for the gossip of our
neighbors. Such work may be a
matter of necessity; it should not
be a source of pride. The political
greatness of England has never
lain in her navies or in the force of
her arms. It has lain in her
struggles for individual freedom.
Not Marlborough nor Nelson nor
Wellington is its exponent. Let
us say rather I'ytn and Hampden
and Gladstone and Bright. The
real problems of England have al
ways been at home. The pomp of
imperialism, the display of naval
power, the commercial control of
India and China —all these areas
the bread and circuses by which
the Roman emperors kept the mob
from their thrones. They keep the
people busy and put off the day of
final reckoning. ''Gild the dome
of the Invalides," was Napoleon's
command when he learned that the
people of Paris were becoming des
perate.
The people of England seek
blindly for a higher justice, a loft
ier freedom, and so the ruling min
istry crowns the good queen as
Empress of India. Meanwhile, the
real problems of civilization de
velop and ripen. They care noth
ing for the greatness of empire nor
the glitter of imperialism. They
mil t be solved by men, and each
man must help solve his own prob
lems. The development of republi
can manhood is just now the most
important matter that any nation
in the world has on hand. We
have been fairly successful thus far,
but perhaps only fairly. Our
government is careless, wasteful,
and unjust, but our men are grow
ing self-contained and wise. De
spite the annual invasion of foreign
illiteracy, the individual intelli
gence of men stands higher in
America than in any other part of
the world. The bearing of the peo
ple at large in these days is a lesson
in itself. 1 watched the crowds
around the bulletin boards the
other night in San Francisco.

These men were laborers, for the
most part, loafers some of them,
not as a whole belonging to the
favored classes. But they did not
form a mob. They were there as
so many individuals. They did
not lose their heads. They kept
the bearing and the reserve of gen
tlemen. 1 saw no rowdyism, no
disorder, no raw enthusiasm. The
war news, false or true, placarded
on the walls, was exciting in its
nature, but the men were not ex
cited; they were ready to net when
the time came for action. They
gave no vulgar display of senti
ment when action was impossible.
Compare the behavior of the
American people in this and other
trying times with that of the
other nations and we see what de
mocracy lias done. And we shall
see more of this as our history goes
on. Free schools, free ballot, free
thought, free religion, —all tend to
enforce self-reliance, self-respect,
and Ihe sense of duty which are
the surest foundation of national
greatness. "Are all the common
men and all the titled ones
so mean?"
An active foreign policy would
slowly change much of this. The
nation which deals with war and
diplomacy must be quick to act ami
quick to change. It must, like the
Oregon, be able to reverse itself
within its own length. To this
end, good government is a neces
sity, whether it be self-government
or not. Democracy yields before
diplomacy. Republicanism steps
aside when war is declared. "An
army," says Wellington, "can get
along under a poor general." It
can do nothing under a debating
society, in war the strongest man
must lead, and military discipline
is the only training for an army.
In a militant nation the same
rules hold in peace as in war. We
can not try civic experiment with a
foe at our gates. A foe is always
at the gates of a nation with a
vigorous foreign policy. The Brit
ish nation is hated and feared of
all nations except our own. Only
her eternal vigilance keeps the vul
tures from her coasts. Eternal
vigilance of this sort will strengthen
governments, will build up nations;
it will not in like degree make
men. The day of the nations as
nations is passing, National am
bitions, national hopes, national
aggrandizement — all these may
becor.«e public nuisances. Imperi
alism, like feudalism, belongs to the
past. The men of the world as
men are drawing closer and closer
together. The needs of commerce
are stronger than the will of na
tions, and the final guarantee of
peace and good will among men
will be not the parliament of na
tions, but the self control of men.
But whatever the outcome of the
present war, whatever the fateful
twentieth century may bring, the
primal duty of Americans is never
to forget that men are more than
nations; that wisdom is more than
glory, and virtue more than domin
ion of the sea. The kingdom of
God is within us. The nation
exists for its men, never the men „
for the nation. "The only govern
ment that I recognize," said Tho
reau, "and it matter" not how few
are at the head of it or how small
its army, is the power that estab
lished justice in the land, never
that which established injustice."
And the will of free men to be just
one toward another is our best
guarantee that "government of the
people, for the people, and by the
people, shall not perish from the
earth."
" Lest we forget, lest we forget."
