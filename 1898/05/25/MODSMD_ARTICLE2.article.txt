# "LEST WE FORGET!"
## Annual Address by President Jordan to the Members of the Graduating Class. 
### 
Members of the Graduating CUlss of
181)8:
With you and such as you lies
the solution of the problems in the
century to come. This is my justi
fication in speaking to you of the
problems of the day. For this year
of 18 ( ,)8 marks one of the great crises
in our National life. Its stern de
mands are on us though we be yet
unconscious. Before we realize the
importance of the choice, the hour
for choosing shall have passed.
Twice before in the history of our
llepublic has a great crisis come
to us, and each time in the past
has ourchoice been a wise one.
The lirst crisis followed the War
of the Revolution. Its question
was this: What relation shall the
emancipated colonies bear to one
another? Tne answer was the
American Constitution, the federa
tion of self-governing and united
states.
The second crisis came through
the growth of slavery. The union
of the states could not endure half
slave, half free. The emancipation
proclamation of Abraham Lincoln
marked our derision thai the Union
should endure, a nd that all tint
makes for division should be swept
away. ll was not the victory of
the Federal arms which decided
this question, ll was the spirit oi
the American people which decreed
that '■government of the people, for
the people, by the people, should
not perish from the eartli."
The third great crisis is on us
now. The war with Spain is only
a part of it, an incident in the great
movement. The question i- not.
Can we capture Manila, Havana,
I'orto liico, or the Canaries? ll is
not what we take or what we hold.
The American navy and the Amer
ican army can accomplish all we
ask i>f them with time and patience.
Battles are fought today through
engineering and technical skili, not
through personal fearlessness and
dash. The great cannon speaks
the language of science, aid
individual courage is helpless be
fore it. The standing of our naval
officers ii.i matters of engineering is
beyond question. They are all
abreast of the nines. There arc a
hundred nameless lieutenants in
our warships alone who, if oppor
tunity offered, could write their
names beside those of Grenville and
Nelson and Farragut and Dewey.
The glory of Manila is not dim be
side that of Mobile or Trafalgar.
The cool strength and soberness
of Yankee courage added to the
power of naval engineering could
meet any foe on earth on equal
terms, and here the terms are not
equal. Personal fearlessness our
adversaries possess and that is all
they have. I'll a t we have in like
measure. Everything else is on
our side. We train our guns
against the empty shell of a medie
val monarchy, broken, corrupt.
Whether we are right or wrong in
our main contention, we can not
fail to win.
Even now as I speak perhaps the
great guns of Sampson's tleet have
opened the black vaults of Morro
Castle to the sunshine of theCarib
bees. Even so the fair is hind which
Spain has kept so long in darkness
may be opened to the sunlight of
modern civilization.
The war with Spain marks in
itself no crisis. The end is seen
from the beginning. It was known
to Spain as clearly as to us. But
her government had no recourse.
They had come to the end of their

diplomacy and could only die fight
ing. "Whatever else the war may
do," says the Spanish diplomat,
with pathetic honesty, ''it can only
bring ruin to Spain."
Jt is too late for us now to ask
how we got into the war. Was it
inevitable? Was it wise? Was it
righteous? No need to ask these
questions, because the answers will
not help us. We have our doubts
as to one or all of these, but all
doubts we must keep to ourselves.
We are in the midst of battle, must
fight to the end. The rough rid
ers are in the saddle. "What j
though the soldiers knew some
one had blundered." The swifter, (
fiercer, more glorious our attacks,
the sooner and more lasting the
peace. Unless we are able to close
the war at once with a few
strong swift blows, we have no ex
cuse for beginning it.
The crisis conies when the war is
over. What then? Our question

is not, "What will wedo with Cuba,
Porto Rico, ami the Philippines?"
It is, "What will these prizes do to
lis?" Can we let go of them in
honor or in safety? If not, what
if we hold them? What will he
the reflex effect of great victories,
suddenly realized strength, the
patronizing applause, the ill-con
cealed envy of great nations, the
conquest of strange territories, the
raising of our Hag beyond the seas?
All this is new to us. It is un-
American; it is contrary to our tra
ditions; it is delicious; it is intoxi
cating.
Kor this is the fact before us. We
have come to our manhood among
the great nations of the earth.
What shall we do about it? The
war once finished shall we go home
again? Shall we go back to our
farms and factories, to squabbles
over tariffs and coinage, our petty
trading in peanuts and postoMices?
Or shall our country turn away
from these things and stand forth
once for all a great naval power,
our vessels in every sea, our in
fluence felt wherever man's foot
falls on the earth? Shall we be

the plain United States again, or
shall we be another England, fear
less even of our own great mother,
second to her only in age and
prestige?
The minor results of war are
matters of little moment in com
parison. Let us look at a few of
them as we pass. .Most of them
are not results at all. The glow of
battle shows old facts in new rela
tions. The war has stirred the
fires of patriotism, we say. Cer
tainly, but they were there already,
else they could not be stirred.
1 doubt if there is more love of
country with us today than there
was a year ago. Heal love of coun
try is not easily moved. Its guar
antee is its permanence. Love of
adventure, love of light, these are
soon kindled. It is these to which
the battle spirit appeals.
Love of adventure we may not
despise. It is the precious heritage
of new races; it is the basis of per-

sonal courage; but it is not patriot
ism: it is push. Love of light is
not in itself unworthy. The race
which can not light if need be is a
puny folk destined to be the prey
of tyrants. If one needs to light
he should fight for all that is
in him.
Hut one who lights for light's
sake, one who goes into a quarrel
which might be avoided, is a bully,
not a hero. The bully is at heart
a coward. To light only when we
are sure of the result, is no proof of
national courage. Nor is any such
proof necessary for the renown of
America.
Patriotism is the will to serve
one's country; shall we say to make
one's country better worth serving?
It is a course of action rather than
a sentiment. It is serious rather
than stirring. The shrilling of the
mob is not patriotism. It is not
patriotism to trample <>n the Span
ish Hag, to burn firecrackers, or to
twist the lion's tail. The shrieking
of war editors is not patriotism
Nowadays nations buy newspapers
as they buy ships. Whatever is
noisv, whether in Congress or the

I»u 1 ]»it, can not be patriotism. It
is not in the galleries that we find
brave men. ''Patriotism," says
Dr. Johnson, "is the last refuge of
the scoundrel." Hut he was speak
ing of counterfeit patriotism.
There could not be a counterfeit
were there not also a reality.
But this L see as i watch the
situation, —true patriotism declines
as the war spirit rises. Men say
they have no interest in reform
until the war is over. There is no
use of talking of better financial
methods, of fairer adjustments of
tuxes, of wiser administration of
affairs, until the war fever has
passed by. The patriotism of the
hour looks to a fight with some
other nation, not towards greater
pride in our own.
But we say the war has
united at last the North and the
South. So at least it appears.
When Fitzhugh Lee is called a
Yankee, and all the haughty Lees
seem proud of the designation, we
may be sure that the old lines of
division exist no longer. North
and South, Last and West, whatever
our blood, birth or rank, we Yan
kees stand shoulder to shoulder in
1898. But our solidarity today
shows that the nation was sound
already, else a month could not
have welded it together.
It is twenty-eight years ago to
day that a rebel soldier who
"Loved tlu; South and dared for her
To tight from Lookout to the sea
With her proud banner over me,"
stood before the ranks of the Grand
Army and spoke these words:
" I stand and say that you were right;
I greet you with uncovered head,
Remembering many a thundrous tight,
When whistling death between us
«lied;
I clasp the hand that made my scars,
I cheer the Hag my fomnen bore,
I shout for joy to see the stars
All on our common shield once
more."
This was more than a quarter of
a century ago and all this time the
great loyal South has patiently and
unflinchingly accepted war's terrible
results. It is not strange then that
she shows her loyalty today. The
Solid South, that bugaboo of politi
cians, the cloak of Northern
venality, lias passed away forever.
The warm response to American
courage, in whatever section or
party, in whatever trade or profes
sion, shows that with all our sur
face divisions we of America are
one in heart, one in all essentials.
The impartial bitterness of Spanish
hatred, directed toward all classes
and conditions of Anglo-Saxons,
alike emphasizes the real unity of
race and nation.
There are some who justify war
for war's sake. Blood-letting "re
lieves the pressure on the bounda
ries."' It whets courage. Jt keeps
the ape and tiger alive in men.
All this is detestable. To waste
good blood is pure loss and murder,
if nothing is gained by it. To let
blood for blood's sake is bad in
politics as it is bad in medicine.
War is killing—brutal, barbarous
killing —and its direct effects are
mostly evil. The glory of war
turns our attention from civic
affairs. Neglect invites corruption.
Noble and necessary as was our
Civil War, we have not yet recov
ered from its degrading influences.
Too often the courage of brave
men is an excuse for the depreda
tions of venal politicians, and the
glorious banner of freedom becomes
the cover for the sutler's tent.
The test of civilization is the
substitution of law for war,statutes
for brute strength. There are not
many really civilized nations yet;
but of this we may be sure, not
often will two of them full into war
