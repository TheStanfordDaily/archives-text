# MANZANITA HALL.
## A 						Modern Type of Secondary School. 
### 
During the last few decades there
has heen a steady revolution in the
material and methods of educa
tion. The movement started in
universities, and when the new
views had won their way to rec
ognition, they began to affect the
conventional ideas connected with
secondary education. One subject
after another has received its adop

tion as available material for men
tal discipline. This increase o
subjects has been accompanied by
a constant protest of the best
minds in all departments of educa
tion against reduction in the length
of time devoted to each subject,
Admitting that each subject is en
titled to a certain length of time,
views divide again on the question
whether the subject should extend
over a long period of time covered
by short recitations which come
only a few times a week, or should
he confined to a shorter period cov
ered by longer recitations that
come daily. .
The best results in college work
come from the concentration on a
few subjects at a time. Karl Ernst
von Baer, the father of embryology,
at the close of a long and success
ful career as an investigator and
teacher, expressed the view that
for the mature student concentra
tion on a single subject would se
cure better results in a few weeks
than distribution of energy on a
variety of subjects will secure in a
very long time, and that even dur
ing earlier training there is more
danger from dissipation than from
the opposite tendency.
Leaving lazy people out of the
question, the most serious weak-
if students entering college is
their lack of power to concentrate
their energies and to work hard
and steadily. Many of them have
never had a taste of kind of
work required for a successful col
lege career, hence many' faithful
students find their freshman year
so very difficult.
Manzanita Hall has adopted a
single aim and has pursued it
steadily, until now there is no
longer any doubt that at least for
the accomplishment of its principal
object —the preparation of students
for the University —it chose wisely
in adopting the principle of con
centration. This choice was al
most inevitable, because in its or
ganization the school would neces
sarily reflect the influence of the
new plan of entrance requirements
adopted by the University. Its
flexible course of study, its per
sistant refusal to offer a smattering
of anything, its plan of concentrat
ing the student's attention on few
subjects at a time, have all been in
a measure the direct outcome of
the plan of University entrance
requirements, and have been abun
dantly justified by the results.
Although there is no official con
nection between them, the relations
of the school to the University are
growing more intimate every year.
Tbe school has only completed its
fifth year, but it is already sending
more boys to the University than
any other secondary school not sup
ported by taxation on the Coast.
Only three years ago the school
moved into its own new buildings
and is now already compelled to
increase its capacity by the addi
tion of another building.
