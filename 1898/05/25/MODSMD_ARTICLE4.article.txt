The Clussof '98 is now numbered
among the alumni of the Univer

have felt the joys and sorrows
which the University has experi
enced,until now they are thoroughly
imbued with the {Stanford spirit.
As '98 goes out into the world with
its strong sense of loyalty, with its
characteristic energy and enthus
iasm, there goes a force which will
tend to widen the scope and ex
tent of the University's power and
influence. The University has
been a kind mother to the class, and
for years to come will be receiving
constant returns. With this proph
ecy we dedicate this Commence
ment Edition to the Class of '98.
