By no means least among the
niiiny advantages and privileges
enjoyed by Stanford students is
the freedom which we have here
from the numerous calls for con
tributions which are thrust in the
way of those who attend similar
institutions elsewhere. Not to
speak of the exemption from high
fees for tuition made at this Uni
versity, the amount which each
student is asked to contribute for
the purpose of keeping alive our
various student interests seems a
very insignificant amount when
compared with that which is ex
pected of the students of other in
stitutions. Stanford University
has been very fortunate in her sys
tem of managing student affairs
and in the selection of loyal men to
take charge of our student hotly
finances. This has made it pos
sible for our wide range of student
activities to be carried on without
calling on the individual student
for a larger cash contribution than
the small assessment of one dollar
levied each year. In view of all
this it seems that every student
who comes to Stanford with any

other idea than that of selfishly
acquiring all he can and giving as
little as possible in return, would
feel it his duty to pay over at once
the small amount asked of him to
help defray the necessary expenses
of the student body.
Those who did not pay their as
sessments on registration day may
do so now at the University post
office or at the Daily Palo Alto
office. It is the intention of the
management to'make up a delin
quent list next week and to ap
point collectors to see those who
have failed to pay. A proper loy
ally to student interests will impel
