# New Art Building.
## 
### 
Through the generosity of Mrs.
Edward Barrow of May Held, it is
possible to erect a building for the
exclusive use of the Art students.
Heretofore the Drawing department
has been cramped and hampered
in its usefulness, by being placed in
the temporary half-story of the
Civil Engineering building, where
the light was poor and the cross
beams were always in the way, be
ing less than tive feet from the floor.
Now, however, the department
will be able to accommodate more
students and with much better
facilities. The new building will be
a plain, substantial structure with
a large room for the general course
and for lectures, and other rooms
for the Life class and for painting.
The building will be completed
early in October. It faces due
north and nasone entiresideof glass
to secure an equal light, and from
one side only.
