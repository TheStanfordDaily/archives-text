The Young Men's Christian As
sociation is stalling the year with
great hope and an ambition to have
a large part in bringing about the
object expressed by the founders of
tiie University: 'To have taught in
the University the immortality of
the soul, the existence of an all
wise and benevolent Creator; and
that obedience to llis laws is the
highest duty oi man."
I he association is the one volun
tary religious organization among
the young men oi the University,
and as sui h should have tilt- earnest
support <t" each student. It seeks
to unite all students who desire to
promote the spiritual life, activity,
and influence of the institution. It
is a part of the greatest student
movement of the world â€” the inter
collegiate Young Men's Christian
Association - greatest in number
and representative character ol
membership, greatest in power and
influence, greatest in fruitfulness or
achievements.
The efforts this year will be used
largely to build up the Bible study
and religious meetings. Classes
will be organized in the life <;f
Christ, using the four Gospels as the
text. An outline course has been
prepared by the international com
mittee and has been found very suc
cessful among the colleges of thi.-
country.
The religious meetings will be
held on Sunday afternoon at four
o'clock. Each meeting will be un
der the direction of a professor, stu
dent, or prominent outside worker.
Every young man is most cordially
invited to these meetings.
