# Practice Game.
## 
### 
Capt. Beckett had his men out
for a practice game on the campus
thin afternoon. All of last year's
Varsity were on the diamond to
gether with a few from the second
nine and Freeman, '00. Several
Freshmen were out, the most prom
ising being Carson, who in the short
time that he was in the box showed
that he possessed considerable speed
and that he knew how to field his
position thoroughly. Four innings
were played, resulting in a score of
4 to 0, the team captained by Lan
agan being victorious.
