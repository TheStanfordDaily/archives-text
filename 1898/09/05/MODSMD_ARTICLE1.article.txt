# VARSITY PROSPECTS.
## New Candidates for Football Honors and Former Players whose Places Must be Filled. 
### 
Varsity prospects and the ma
terial for the team of 1898 are al
ready a current topic of conversa
tion and discussion. A preliminary
survey of the material in the Uni
versity has shown the presence of
many men who will try for end
and hack-held positions, while
there are fewer men to try for the
heavier places on the line.
Stanford has lost this year by
graduation and enlistment the fol
lowing: Fickert and Carle, guards;
Burnett, center; Rice and Thomas,
tackles; Jeffs, end; Daly, halfback;
and Cotton, fullback. The Varsity
men who are now in the Univer
sity are Captain Fisher, halfback;
Murphy, quarter-back; Ilea Smith
and Parker, ends.
For the success of this year's
team we have to rely upon the men
who have been developed during
the last three years by the splendid
second eleven policy instituted by
Camp and carried out successfully
by Cross and Brooke. From hist
year's second eleven we have lost
by enlistment Leavitt, '1)9, end;
Dole, '01, who played a plucky
game at agaiust Guiberson
in the Freshman game; and War
dall, '01, who had shown up well
at half. To counterbalance this
loss we have the return of men who
came dangerously near making the
Varsity in previous years.
Present indications are for a
somewhat lighter but speedier team,
with quick ends and shifty tackles,
and backs of average weight, but
with a trifle more speed than in
former years.
The following second eleven men
have returned after an absence of
one or more semesters: Mcintosh,
Freeman, Blanchard, Beckley, and
Burmeister. It is not known as
yet whether <l Hi 11" Harrington or
James will return to the University
this semester.
Among the old men who will be
seen on the gridiron this semester
are the following: Fisher, Mur
phy, R. Smith, Parker, McFadden,
Erb, Bigelow, Husk, Emerson, Wil
son, Dole, Beckett, Woodruff,
Wadsworth, and Bidwell.
The most promising freshmen
appear to be Carson, fullback on
the Belmont team for the last two
years; Rice, end on Tamalpais
Academy; Geissler, full for St.
Matthews; Sells, end on Denver
high school team; and Cooper, full
back for the Portland high school
team.
Captain Fisher especially urges
that every man heavy enough for
a line position get out and try for
the team.
Active work on the part of the
football management began today.
Assistant Manager Berry stated to
day that work on the football Held
would begin tomorrow. The field
will be in condition for practice by
next Thursday. The ground will be
broken up at once and sprinkled
until it is in good shape Water is
scarce and costly this season but
the management promise the foot
ball men that the field will be in
fine shape.
Fred L, Berry, '99, has been ap
pointed assistant football manager

to act for Prichard, '98, who is
working on a geological survey in
Idaho. He is expected to arrive
at the University some time next
week.
Coach Cross will arrive here on
the fifteenth of this month.
At a meeting in San Francisco
last Saturday between Manager
Brown of Berkeley and Mr. Morris
of the Olympic Club and Treasurer
Fickert, the organization of the
Olympic Club team and the sched
ule of games was talked over but
nothing definitely decided. The
organization of the Athletic Club
team depends upon the acceptance
of their terms, which are a trifle too
high. A meeting will be held in
the city some time this week to set
tle matters. The proposed sched
ule, which will undoubtedly be ac
cepted, makes Stanford's first game
October 1.
