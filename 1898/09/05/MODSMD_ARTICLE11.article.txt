The catalogue prepared by stu
dents last Saturday may not be
made accessible for a day or two, as
alphabetizing a large number of
cards is slow work. It will be in
students' interest to put shelf num
bers (given in left top corner of the
catalogue) on their call slips: books
will be brought to them .without
delay. To avoid the latter, no books
will be given out, unless the call
slips are properly tilled. Students
are requested to step out for any
conversation in order not to annoy
those who come to the reading-room
to work. No students wiil be ad
mitted to the slacks without recom

mendations from their professors. A
setof printed rules is contemplated,
but they all may be summed up in
one : don't forget that otber persons
wish to use the library, and
that it is your duty to treat your
neighbors in a gentlemanly and
ladylike way, with manly respect
for their interests.
