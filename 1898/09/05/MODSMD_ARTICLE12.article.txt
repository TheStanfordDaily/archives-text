# The 						Stanford Inn.
## 
### 
"Stanford University Inn"stands
as the present solution of a part of
the Encina Hall problem. W hen
the dining-room of Encina was
closed last semester, a place where
the men of Encina could get their
meals became necessary and the
restaurant scheme was evolved.
The Inn contains three dining
rooms, with accommodations for one
hundred and forty. The main din
ing-hall is a large, light, cheerful
room with a seating capacity for
one hundred. The tables are small
and round, capable of seating four
or live persons comfortably.
The second dining-hall is reserved
for families, although it is always
open to students. The third room
is the visitors' room, and is supplied
with a special menu card. This
room will also be open at all times
to students.
Meals at the Inn will be strictly
a la carte. Breakfast will be served
from 6:30 until 9:30 a.m.; lunch
from 11:30 a.m. until 2:30 p.m.;
dinner from 4:05 until 7 p.m.
Short orders will also be served any
time during these hours.
Mr. Johnson, the caterer, is an
experienced restauranteur, being
the proprietor of Johnson's Cream
erie and Restaurant in San Fran
cisco.
An advantage will be gained by
the restaurant in that it will be a
place where, as Mr. Johnson says,
'•a needy student can get a substan
tial meal at a reasonable price." It
is, of course, impossible to discrim
inate between the wealthy and the
needy student, but the menu card
has been so arranged that a student
can procure good meals at the rate
of about eighteen dollars a month.
Ice cream and soda will be sold at
the Inn.
The Inn opens at present with
a fuil corps of professional waiters,
but as soon as students can be
broken in and places found by Mr.
Johnson in his city restaurants for
the professionals, they will be re
placed by students.
