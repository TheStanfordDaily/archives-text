Dear Sir —Allow me to express
through your paper my sincere
thanks to those students and pro
fessors who catalogued the Library
last Saturday. The whole student
body will appreciate, together with
the Library staff, the great value of
that voluntary work and the facil
ity it will give in the use of the
Library in the future.
Yours truly,
A. V. Babine.
To the Student Body.
The Associated Students levy
upon each student an annual assess
ment of $1.00. The fund thus
raised is used to help defray the
current expenses of football, base
ball, track athletics, women's ath
letics, and musical organizations.
Money is needed to get the foot
ball team in condition for the
Thanksgiving game: therefore every
student is urged to pay his assess
ment now. No further levy will be
made during the year.
