# Death of Prof. Margaret M. Wickham
## 
### 
With the opening of the new Uni
versity year there comes the sad
news of the death of Miss Margaret
M. Wickham, who for four years
was connected with the department
of German in our University.
Miss Wickbam's early years were
passed in and about New York.
Having lost her father early in life,
the charge of her preparatory edu
cation was assumed almost wholly
by her mother and continued until
she was ready for college.
In 1882 she entered Vassar Col
lege and was graduated with honor
in 1886. She at once entered upon
her chosen profession, teaching at
the Middleton Academy and the
Carcadilla School at Ithaca, N. Y.
While in Ithaca Miss Wickham's
home was with our former non-resi
dent professor of European history,
Andrew I). White, at present Min
ister to Germany. After teaching
two years and a half Miss Wickham
gave up her work and went to Ger
many for further study. While in
Germany she studied in Berlin and
Leipsic, and on her return accepted
the position of instructor in German
in the Cleveland College for Women.
The following year she was pro
moted to the rank of associate pro

fessor. In 1893 Miss Wickham
came to Stanford University as as
sistant professor of German and
remained with us until the fall of
1897 when she resigned her position
here to accept the professorship of
German in Adelphia College, the
newly organized department of the
long established Adelphia Academy
in Brooklyn, N. Y.
A few weeks before the close of
the collegiate year Miss Wickham
was taken sick, and died August 13,
at Thrall Hospital, Middleton,
N. Y. Miss Wickham had prepared
to spend her vacation in Germany
and all her plans were made to sail
June 18, but at that time she was ill
at her home in Port Jervis, N. Y.
Miss Wickham was a most woman
ly woman and one whose presence
atour University was an inspiration
to all. Her love for her chosen
calling impressed all who came into
her presence. All who worked with
her feel most deeply her loss, and
yet to us is bequeathed the mem
ory of a noble woman.
