All students will do well to heed
the warning given by Professor
Branner at the reception Friday
evening regarding the University
water supply during the present
dry season. That warning come?
from an expert and when lie says
that even with the greatest care in
the use of our water there is a grave
possibility of a water famine this
fall unless there come early rains,
we can be sure that such is the
case. Nine hundred students would
waste a great deal of water with or
dinary care ; but if th<>-e students
will be rigidly economical until we
find,such a course to be no longer
necessary, they will be performing
an important duty.
