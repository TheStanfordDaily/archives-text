# EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.
## Student Body Representatives Transact the First Business of the Year. 
### 
The first meeting of the Execu
tive Committee of the Associated
Students was held in room 11 quad at
7 :o0 Monday night, with President
Schwartz in the chair and the fol
lowing members present: Shoe
maker, '99, Arnold, '99, Edwards,
'00, Gilman, '01, Cantwell, '01, and
Miss Tucker, '99, secretary, the only
member absent being Mr. Coverley,
who will not return to the Univer
sity until next week.
In calling the meeting to order
the chairman said that he thought
it would be advisable to hold fre
quent short meetings of the com
mittee instead of trying to transact
the business which would come up
during the year at a few long ses
sions. He explained that this would
enable those who wished to bring
any business before the committee
to do so without unnecessary delay,
and at the same time would leave
no excuse for any failure to consult
the committee on any matter over
which it had jurisdiction. He
thought it best for the committee to
let it be plainly understood from
the start that no violations of the
student body constitution would be
tolerated. He believed that if the
committee conducted itself with
frankness and dignity there would
be no ground for any misunder
standing, and that nothing but the
most cordial relations would exist
between the various officers and
managers of student body interests.
The committee first gave its at
tention to the uncompleted records
of the business transacted last year,
and took steps to have them brought
up to date.
An appropriation of ten dollars
was made for the current expenses
of the Mandolin Club.
A communication from the Stu
dents' Guild was read, which urged
the committee to provide a place at
the University where student body
records could be kept. Mr. Arnold
was appointed a committee to look
into the matter and report at a
later meeting.
Mr, Berry appeared before the
committee to outline his plans for
beginning work on the football
field. He was instructed to go ahead
with the work of brea king the south
half of last year's lield, but to post
pone work on the part used for a
baseball diamond until lie had in
vestigated the cost of filling in the
lield used two years ago. Another
meeting of the committee wascalled
for Thursday night to discuss the
matter of preserving the two differ
ent lields.
