in football material through grad
uation and enlistment, the spirit,
that was shown last night at the
meeting of the football men will do
much toward building up another
victorious team. Not only in the
number of good men who signified

Football enthusiasts at the Uni

that the two weeks of practice that
their men had before ours began
will give them a lead that they can
maintain throughout the season.
We feel confident, however, that
what they have gained in time will
all be made up by the hard and
conscientious work of our team.
At any rate we are after them now,
and it would indeed be surprising
should Berkeley succeed in keeping
her lead.
