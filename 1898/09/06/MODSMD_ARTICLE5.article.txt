# LECTURE BY PROF. JAMES.
## An Interesting Discourse on Life's Significance. 
### 
The chapel was crowded with
students yesterday afternoon to
hear Professor William James lec
ture on "What makes our lives sig
nificant?"
"Your institution," said he in
opening, "is like a mouse-trap: a
colleague from another institution,
once in, can not get out without
leaving some of his fur on the
wires.
''The truth with which 1 wish to
begin is this, that being practical
beings with our own vital problems
to solve and ideals to look after, we
are condemned to a certain narrow
ness of view that makes us quite
blind to the feelings, the peculiar
joys and sorrows, in fact to the
whole inner significance of lives
that differ much from our own.
We can not fathom or understand
them. Judging them by our own
feelings, we entirely miss the mark
and remain outside the pale. Cer
tain persons do exist with an enor
mous capacity for .friendship and
for taking delight in other people's
lives, and such people know more
of truth than if their hearts were
not so big.
"So far, then, this is our result:
a great cloud-bank of ancestral
blindness weighing down upon us,
• but transiently riven here and
there by fitful revelations of the
truth. It is vain to hope for this
state of things to alter much. Our
inner secrets must remain for the
most part impenetrable by others,
for beings essentially practical as
we are, are necessarily short of
sight. But if we can not gain much
positive insight into each other,
can not we at least use our sense of
our own blindness to make us more
cautious going over the dark
places? Can not we escape some of
those hideous ancestral intolerances
and positive reversals of truth?"
The lecturer then told of a week
spent at the famous Chautauqua
assembly grounds. "Here you have
a foretaste of what human society
might be, were it all in the light,
with no suffering and no dark cor
ners. 1 went for a day; t stayed a
week. Yet what was my astonish
ment on emerging to find myself
involuntarily saying: 'What a re
lief! This order is too tame, this
culture too second-rate, this good
ness too insipid. Let. me take my
chances again in the outside world,
with all its sins and sufferings.
There are the heights and depths;
there is more hope and help, a
thousand times, than in this dead
level of mediocrity.'
"Breathing the air of the world
again, and seeing in a new ligb'
the lives of the common people, i
said,' Where is our Tolstoi, to bring
the truth of all this home to our
American bosoms, till us with a
better insight, and wean us away
from that spurious literary roman
ticism on which our wretched so
called culture is fed?' Divinity
lies all about us, and culture is too
hide-bound to even suspect the
fact." After giving some of Tol
stoi's views, thelecturer continued:
"Yet Tolstoi's philosophy, deeply
enlightening though it certainly is,
remains a false abstraction. It

savors too much of that oriental
pessimism which declares the whole
phenom*. 1 world to he a cunning
fraud. •<».t a mere fraud is just
what our Western common sense
will never believe the phenomenal
world to he."It admits fully that
the inner joys and virtues are the
essential part of life's business; but
it is sure that some positive part is
also played by the adjuncts of the
show. Heroism is with us really
under every disguise, at Chautau
qua, here in your University, in
the stock-yards and on the freight
trains, and in the Czar of Russia's
court.
"The barrenness and ignobleness
of the usual laborer's life consists
in the fact that it is moved by no
inner ideal springs. This is why
we raise monuments to the soldier
and not to the laborer. An ideal
must be something of which we are
conscious, and which has novelty
for us. Sodden routine is incom
patible with ideality. But to have
a noble character we must have
ideals combined with what the
laborers have, the sterner stuff of
manly virtue. Neither the one
thing alone nor the other is enough.
There must be some sort of fusion,
some chemical combination among
these principles for a life objectively
and thoroughly significant to
result.
"We are suffering today in Amer
ica from what is ca.led the labor
question. So far as this question
is unhealthy and regrettable, the
unhealthiness consists solely in the
fact that one half of our fellow
countrymen are entirely blind to
the internal significance of the
lives of the other half.
u The solid meaning of life, the
meaning which so many miss, is
always the same eternal thing: the
marriage, namely, of some unhab
itual ideal, however special, with
some fidelity, courage, and endur
ance, with some man's or woman's
pains; and where life is there will
always be a chance for that mar
riage to take place."
