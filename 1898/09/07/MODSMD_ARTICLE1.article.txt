# LAST NIGHT'S LECTURE.
## President Jordan Talks to the New Students on their Relations to the University. 
### 
The first Tuesday evening lecture
of the semester was given by Presi
dent Jordan last night. It was his
annual address to freshmen, the
subject this year being "Liberty."
" Several years rfgo," began Dr.
Jordan, "in an invaluable maga
zine called the Sequoia, an article
was published which stated that at
this University we do not tell stu
dents what to do, preferring to just
let them knock around and find out.
Hut I thought it was best to give
the freshmen some few points.
There are no sign posts telling
you to keep off the grass, but we
are not indifferent as to where you
walk, nor in what manner you
walk. We want to make our stu
dents grow up to be good men —
good, but not goody.
Now there are three ideals of
goodness. First, implicit obedience
to others. That which is some
times called sealed orders. Some
people think men should grow up
under sealed orders. That is good
for soldiers, though judging from
the late war a great many soldiers
could do better work if tliev were
merely told to go ahead and rout
out the enemy.
Again, there is the man who is
virtuous because he has not enough
blood in him to be anything else.
That kind of a man couldn't be
bad if he tried. This is the old
ascetic idea of goodness.
Then there is the man who is
capable of taking care of himself.
That man will not be bad. He will
have other thjngs to do
Men are generally as good as
they are allowed to be. If a man
is bad it is because there is some
thing holding him down. This
ideal of goodness is the ideal of our
Republic. It is better to have the
law in the hearts of the people than
011 the statute books.
The ideal of the Republic is the
university. In fact, a university
has been called a republic of letters
which is over and above settled
orders.
This is the idea of freedom here
at Stanford. Here we gire you an
opportunity to practice governing
yourselves. You are given a chance
to choose your own studies. Not
that we think you know what is
better for yourselves than we do,
for, after talking with you for five
or ten minutes and learning some
thing about you, I could probably
pick out studies better suited for
you than those you have selected
for yourselves. So could any of
your professors. We have been in
that business a long time. Hut you
wouldn't get the experience and
practice that comes from choosing
for yourselves.
We let you choose your own as
sociates to a great extent. If you
make mistakes in your choices they
will correct themselves in three or
four years. You choose your own
professors, your advisors. The best
thing a man has in his mind is the
power and will to choose for him
self. Then there is the choice of a
life work, which is vastly more im
portant. The best thing about
work we choose for ourselves is this
very element of consent.

Now si few words to the fresh
men. We will say there are about
four hundred of you registered.
During the year between thirty
and forty will be sent home. They
will not have done anything bad,
perhaps they will have been among
the best people here so far as
morals are concerned; but they
have either been pulled too green
or are too rusty —the cog-wheels
don't work right. About twenty
five or thirty will find out that we
have a committee on questions of
drunkenness, vice, and other forms
of disgrace. Some of you may be
cautioned about mere noise. Ten
or twelve may be sent away be
cause their choice of things in gen
eral does not suit us. They make
us tired. There are things we don't
want you to do. We don't want
you to ride bicycles on the pedes
trian path, not that it is wrong, but
it inconveniences those who walk.
For the same reason we do not
want you to walk on the bicycle
path. We do not want rushes on
the top of the water tanks, for a cer
tain number are sure to fall off and
break their necks. The objection to
rushes is that they are rowdyish
and small-boyish. All these are
things which injure the reputation
of the University.
Bismarck once said of the stud
ents of the German universities,
that there are three classes: one
third kill themselves by excesses;
one third by excessive study; and
the other third govern Europe. It
is our business to eliminate the
first two classes and to develop the
third, for the time is coming soon
when university students will gov
ern our country. It will take col
lege men to see through the prob
lems of government and to handle
them.
With reference to the first class
he said: 'Had men make the uni
versity atmosphere bad. The in
stitution is better off if those whom
it can not help are away from
it."
After a few words to those who
work hard on account of poverty,
Dr. Jordan continued: "He cheer
ful. Don't be too full of introspec
tion and remorse. Don't worry
over the destiny of man. He wise
if you can, wealthy, and famous,
but keep well while you are at it.
Don't burn the candle at both
ends, nor too long at one end.
Save the candle; you will not get
another. If you dim the one you
have, I know not where is the Pro
methean heat that can light re
sume. Save the candle. Go to
bed."
