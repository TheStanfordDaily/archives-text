There is a feeling abroad in the
student body that the football
season has not opened as quickly
and with as much snap as in for
mer years. While it is true that
no heavy work could be done at
this time of the year, nevertheless
the men should be getting into con
dition, by means of punting and
cross-country running, for the
more severe strain of later practice.
This is work which can be carried
on without tiie instruction of a
coach. Mr. Cross will arrive here
about the fifteenth of this month
and the men should be in some
condition by that time.
Neither the captain nor the
treasurer can be blamed, for they
are doing all that their office*
require of them. The proper place
for the manager of the Stanford
University football team is at Stan
ford University, California.
