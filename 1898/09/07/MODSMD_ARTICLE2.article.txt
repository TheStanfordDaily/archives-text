# Berkeley Notes.
## 
### 
—Berkeley is busily preparing
for a debate with Hastings' Law
School, which is to be held during
the hitter part of this month.
—The students of the University
of California are endeavoring to
adopt a new constitution which
provides for a radical change in the
plan for the management of the
athletic funds. Heretofore business
managers have given no bonds, and
there has been no adequate check
upon them. Under the new con
stitution the student body will have
a paid treasurer, and business
managers will have less chance to
be dishonest.
