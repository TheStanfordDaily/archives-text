The committee of the Chapel
Union desires to make a special
feature of the music for the
services of this year. A choir
practice will be held in the
chapel Friday afternoon at
4:30 o'clock. All students who can
sing and will assist are requested
by Chorister Hyde to be present at
the meeting. As defined in the
Register, " The University Chapel
Union attempts to organize the re
ligious forces of the University
without defining beliefs for the pro
motion of the spiritual life through
worship and service." This Union
was organized in the fall of 1896
for the purpose of providing for the
religious services held in the chapel.
A committee was at that time
chosen to look after the services,
and this committee selects its own
successors each year. It is at pres
ent composed of Dr. Thoburn,
chairman, Dr. Elliott, Professors
Show, Miller, Griffin, and Murray,
Mrs. Whittier, Mrs. Stearns, Miss
Macgillivray, and Walter Clark.
Provision is made for the regular
Sunday morning service at 11
o'clock, the young people's meeting,
conducted in the chapel by students
at 7:30 every Sunday evening, and
the chapel vesper service, held at
4:30 p.m. Thursdays. Voluntary
contributions from the University
community, which may be paid to
Dr. Elliott or Walter Clark, treas
urer of the Union, are the means
by which the necessary expenses,
in way of buying music and paying
for various incidentals, are met.
About $250 will be required this
semester for the purchase of new
music, etc., but the amount will be
much less during the second.

All students may become mem
bers of this Union, which is the
central factor of the University re
ligious life, by merely taking an
interest in its work. It is certainly
of vital concern to every student
here to have these services well sup
ported. At last Sunday evening's
meeting Miss Macgillivray read a
letter from Mrs. Stanford regretting
that she could not attend the meet
ing and expressing great sympathy
with the work.
