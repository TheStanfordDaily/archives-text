Captain Beckett's call for a
meeting of baseball men for tomor
row should meet with a hearty re
sponse on the part of those stud
ents who have any baseball ability
whatever, for ii is none too early
to consider matters pertaining to
the diamond. A well-defined plan
of fall work has been thought out
and all that is necessary to put it
in operation is a willingness and
determination on the part of the
players to help.
