# LECTURE BY MISS BINGHAM.
## Practical Methods of Teaching- Young Deaf Children to Talk Compared and Illustrated. 
### 
A very interesting lecture on
"How to teach young deaf children
to speak" was delivered in the
chapel last evening by Miss Cor
nelia Bingham of Chicago.
Miss Bingham gave brief outlines
of the various systems for teaching
the deaf to speak, and compared
them. She does not believe in the
system of signs because by that
method the deaf can convey their
thoughts only to those who have a
degree of proficiency in the sign
language. A much more effective
way is to teach the children to
make the sounds and actually talk,
receiving impressions by noting the
changes in position of the lips of
the speaker. A method used to
some extent is a combination of
these two. One drawback to the
method which she advocates is
that the children at their play use
sign language, which is easier,
leaving the other to be acquired in
a more laborious way in the class
room.
Miss Bingham closed the lecture
with an exhortation to men and
women of Stanford to do all they
can to better the condition of deaf
children, since it can be done so
easily.
After the lecture Miss Bingham
gave a practical demonstration of
what can be done lor deaf children
by talking to her brother, whom
she has taught to speak. The little
fellow's quaint rendition of the
Stanford yell in answer to the
question, "What do the boys say at
Stanford?" scored a decided hit.
