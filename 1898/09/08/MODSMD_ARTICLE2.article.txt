# Baseball Meeting.
## 
### 
The baseball men met in room
10 quad this afternoon to discuss
the advisability of hitving fall prac
tice. Captain Beckett said that in
all probability the diamond would
not he converted into a football
field this year, as has formerly been
done. All those present agreed
that the benefit to be derived from
occasional practice during the lirst
semester is considerable.
It is Captain Beckett's plan to
get the men out twice each week,
probably on Wednesday and Satur
day, to limber up. Most of ihe time
will be devoted to batting practice,
the men doing merely enough lidd
ing work to keep in form and to
keep their arms in trim. Toward
the end of the semester practice
games will be played.
All the old players and several
promising freshmen attended the
meeting.
