# A 						LETTER FROM DILLON.
## Tales of Fighting and Fun in Hawaii and the Ladrones en route to Manila. 
### 
The following extracts from a
hiier written by Charles J. Dillon,
ex-'VJ9, one of the Stanford volun
teers,to J.E. Uhlein, '01, are of much
interest in describing life on board
the transport, the capture of Guam,
and Various other incidents.
" 1 he tirst part of our trip from
Sati Francisco to Honolulu was
made without incident. Our re
ception at the hitter place can not
l>e described in writing. Every
place was thrown open to us. Some
$8,000 was subscribed and collected
for our entertainment. 1 think
they spent it all. The second day
of our stay we were tendered a
" feed" in the ex-queen's palace
grounds. I niagine feeding 3,000 men
at once. They did it. After the
meal the Stanford men of Hono
lulu, some live of them, took us
soldier-Stanfordites in buses all
over the outskirts of the city, and
in the evening gave us a banquet.
" YVe left Honolulu June 4th,
after a stay of three days. One
day afterward the Charleston, our
consort, signaled to the three tran
sports that sealed orders were re
ceived at Honolulu to proceed to
the island of Guam, one of the La
drone group. Well, we arrived out
side the harbor of Guam at dawn
June 20th. The Charleston took
the lead and cautiously approached
the harbor. We transports re
mained outside the range of shots,
inside the harbor there is (or rather
was) a small fort manned by live
guns. The Charleston began tiring
at it, and after thirteen shots had
been fired it was found that nothing
remained of the fort but the guns.
Twelve of the shots had taken effect.
The only city on the island is
Agana. It is four miles inland.
Now comes the funnv part. The
Governor of the island has a force
of 57 men, all Spanish. These
brave men hurried from the city to
the fort when they heard the
Charleston's guns, and thinking it
was a Spanish warship saluting,
they were eager to return the sa
lute. Hut they couldn't find the
fort. When they realized what had
happened, the Governor put out in
a small boat flying a flag of truce,
lie wanted to know what the row
was about; and when asked if he
knew that war had been 'declared,
he said, "No," The last news re
ceived by them was April 7th. He
was ordered to surrender and asked
for a little time. T his was extended
until the next morning at Bo'clock.
As nothing was heard of him at the
time appointed, a force of 1(H) men
(Co.'s A and 1)) of our regiment,
and fifty marinesof the Charleston,
were put off to land in boats, but
just as they were two hundred feet
from shore the Governor appeared
flying a white flag in his boat. He
had surrendered. This ended the
bloodless capture of Guam. The
Governor and his soldiers were
taken aboard the transport Sydney,
and we all proceeded on our way to
Manila, which place we hope to
reach within two days.
" There were numerous incidents
in connection with the above cap
ture that were amusing. One is
this: Our oflicers had heard at

Honolulu that there was a small
Spanish gunboat at Guam. When
we arrived there at dawn, we could
see the outlines of what appeared
to be a small gunboat, but what
proved to be a Japanese whaling
vessel painted white. As the
Charleston entered the harbor she
was Hying a Japanese Hag, to dis
guise herself no doubt, and after
she commenced firing the Jap
whaler got her little gun ready and
commenced firing too. Then they
put a boat off to the Charleston to
ask when war had been declared
between Japan and Spain. That
was too good a joke, so the stars and
stripes were run up instead. Our
boys were disappointed that they
didn't get to do any lighting. They
hope to do so at Manila.
" 1 went ashore at Guam to get
fruit, and found the natives very
hospitable. When they were told
that the islands belonged to the
United States, they fairly danced
with glee, called us there new found
brothers, etc. They loaded us down
with fruit and wouldn't take any
thing for it. Their story of oppres
sion was pitiable. They have been
taxed till they hardly own the
clothes on their backs. They some
what resemble theHawaiians, being
quite as intelligent. They are happy
now. A young man, Thomas Wil
son, born on the island of Ameri
can parents, who gave information
regarding t he islands to the general,
was appointed governor pro tem.
after all firearms and ammunition
had been secured. Our trip has
been excellent. Haven't even en
countered a rough sea. Everyone
aboard is healthy and has thor
oughly enjoyed it. While the
weather has been hot, every one
has been sleeping out in the open
air. Of course we've been crowded,
but if we can not get a place to
sleep on the upper deck, why, we
hang out on the yard-arm or any
old place.
"1 find that 1 have neglected to
mention some of the awful taxes
Spain imposes upon the inhabitants
of Guam. For a birth, $8.00; a
burial, $11.00; poll tax, $1 .55 to
men and women; to kill a pig, 25
cents; to kill an ox, 75 cents. No
wonder they are now happy.
"Tomorrow we are to meet the
despatch boat McCullough. Then
we will get some news. It has
been a month since we have had
news, and oh, my! won't it be good
to hear something new! We are to
meet at Ballington Island, an Eng
lish possession. According to the
war agreement we can not remain
there more than twenty-four hours.
Then we are under the eye of the
great Dewey, and we all hope to lie
called up to finish the line work he
has so noblv commenced."
