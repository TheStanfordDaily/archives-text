In a few days we will be in the
midst of class elections. The choice
of a good or an inferior staff of of
ficers has usually a lasting effect
on the history of class affairs.
Oliver Wendell Holmes was once
asked on short notice to fill a lec
ture appointment in a large South
ern city 111 the place of a friend
who had been taken suddenly ill.
"Well," replied Mr. Holmes, "if 1
can not fill the position, I can at
least shuck around in it."
In class affairs we need men and
women who fill their positions. To
put the right man into the right
office is not an easy matter, and
chance can not be depended upon
to accomplish that result. This
warning is especially pertinent in
regard to the choice of the presi
dent of the freshman class. Too
often, in our own University, he
has secured his"* position simply
through chance. It is unnecessary
to say that this might at some
time lead a class into unenviable
notoriety.
The Stanford University Inn
has been in operation long enough
to show that it is a success. If the
food and service continue to be as
excellent as they are now, not only
will the Inn itself be a success, but
another desire of the Stanford
student's heart will be accom
plished—Encina Hall will be
filled. Life at Encina is more
agreeable this year than it has
been for several years. One great
objection that many Palo Alto res
idents have raised to moving into
the hall has always been that it is
so noisy. This objection is no
longer valid. The hall is quieter
in the evenings now than it has
ever been before. Encina residents
should realize that studious men

have heretofore objected to the
noise in the hull evenings which
prevented study, and should see to
it that the quiet of this early part
of the year be maintained. An
other objection to living on the
campus—the cost—has been done
away with by the Inn. A student
can live as cheaply and as well in
Encina and the Inn as in Palo
Alto, and the time lost now by
Palo Alto residents in travel back
and forth could very profitably be
spent in recreation. It is custom
ary in Encina to spend the half
hour after dinner in singing, danc
ing, and social intercourse, and the
spirit of this free good-fellowship
and intimacy is not found any
where else in University life, and
when a student neglects it he suf
fers the loss of an important part
of his training in college.
