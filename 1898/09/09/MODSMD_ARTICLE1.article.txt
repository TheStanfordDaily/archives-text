### 
The Executive Committee of the
Associated Students met in room
13 quad last night at 7:30, with the
following members present: Presi
dent Schwartz, Shoemaker, '99,
Arnold, '99, Cantwell, '01, Gilman,
'01, and Miss Tucker, '99.
The principal matter with which
the committee had to deal was the
question of tearing up the baseball
diamond for the use of the football
men and also deciding what should
be done about providing a place lor
fall baseball practice. Captains
Fisher and Beckett were present
on behalf of their respective teams,
and Dr. Angell wa* present by re
quest to give his views of the sub
ject as a member of the faculty
athletic committee. After prolonged
discussion, participated in by the
members of the committee, Treas
urer Fickert, the two captains, and
Dr. Angell, the question was settled
for the present to the entire satis
faction of all concerned. The base
ball diamond is to be turned into a
football held for fall practice, the
faculty athletic held is to be used
by the baseball men for their
fall practice, and the president of
the student body has been empow
ered to appoint a committee of
three to consult with Mrs. Stan
ford, President Jordan, and others
who may be interested in the mat
ter, regarding the policy which
shall be followed out in the future
in the location of the athletic fields.
Dr. Angell in his remarks to the
committee spoke of the very great
desirability of having fall practice
for the baseball men, which would
be an impossibility unless separate
fields were provided, lie thought
the time had come for us to decide
what our future athletic policy
was to be. He believed the present
Executive Committee should take
the matter up and outline a definite
plan so that the question might be
settled once for all.
President Schwartz has not yet
selected the men who will have to
deal with the problem which now
confronts the student body. He
will announce the committee on
Monday.
Mr. Drake appeared before the
committee and asked for an appro
priation â€žof fifteen dollars for the
Glee Club to secure the services of
Mr. Morris for the try-out this
afternoon, and for music and sta
tionery. The amount was granted.
Mr. Victor, tennis manager,
wished to be empowered to buy
three nets for the Encina courts,
the expense not to exceed thirteen
dollars, lie was instructed to draw
on the feasury for the necessary
sum.
Mr. Fickert reported that Mr.
Prichard had left orders that no
schedule of games was to be made
out until he returned, and asked
what should be done. He and Mr,
Herry were empowered to arrange
the schedule of games for the year
whenever Berkeley and the Olym
pics were ready to consider the
matter.
Mr. Fickert also asked the com
mittee what should be done regard
ing the Thanksgiving souvenir.

The committee voted to issue the
souvenir as before, and gave Mr.
Fickert full charge of it.
At the conclusion of the other
business Mr. Schwartz suggested
that Treasurer Fickert be elected
an honorary member of the com
mittee for the year, which was done
by a unanimous vote.
In thanking the committee for
this honor, Mr. F'ckert expressed
his pleasure at the friendly feeling
thus shown and predicted that the
present harmonious relations would
characterize all the business of the
year.
The committee then adjourned to
meet again next Thursday after
noon at four o'clock.
