The first number of the Sequoia
for this year came out this after
noon. The lirst noticeable change
from the paper of former years is
the cover. The design is extremely
neat and attractive arid the tint of
the paper brings out clearly the
black and red of the ink. The
three cardinal initials of the cap
tion cull attention to the fact that
the paper is called The Stanford
Sequoia this year. Mr. Adams,
the editor, inserted the word Stan
ford in the title so that the paper
should he properly credited to the
University in exchanges, as former

editors have complained that
quoted articles, being credited to
the Sequoia, simply did not iden
tify tliem with any particular col
lege.
The inside of the paper, despite
mistakes in arrangement due very
likely to the confusion of getting
out the first number of the year, is
very attractive. The most interest
ing article is, "A Football Yarn," by
(Jeorge Bliss Culver, '97, who is
now in Government service at
Washington, D. C.
