During his vacation in Honolulu
the past summer Dr. T. D. Wood
made a collection of fishes for the
Zoological Laboratory of the Uni
versity. He collected them from
the fish markets and elsewhere and
succeeded in gathering; together
some very valuable specimens. He
brought ninety-three varieties, a
considerable number of which are
of striking character, some being
very highly colored and others
covered with unique designs. Ar
rangements were made to have the
collection supplemented from time
to time by a resident of Honolulu.
This is the first collection of fishes
from the Hawaiian Islands to come
to the laboratory, and is conse
quently extremely valuable.
