The proposal of the Junior Class
to institute a series of inter-class
baseball games this semester is a
good one. Since the faculty ath
letic grounds are to be put in
shape for immediate baseball prac
tice, every effort should be made to
bring out all new material and to
keep the old players in shape for
the spring games. Manager Lan
agan and Captain Beckett have
been untiring in their efforts to stir
up baseball interest and they
should receive the co-operation of
the entire student body.
