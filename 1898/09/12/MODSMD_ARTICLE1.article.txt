# THE
						SUNDAY SERMON.
## Rev. Howard Points Out the Fallibility of Books and Men and the Power of the Spirit. 
### 
Rev. Burt Estes Howard of Los
Angeles delivered an eloquent ser
mon in the chapel Sunday morn
ing on 'â€¢ Authority in religion."
lie discussed religion from the
standpoint of the church, the Bible,
and reason or inner consciousness,
clearly demonstrating that no one
of these is infallible.
Man's search, he said, is always
after an infallible rule or practice.
Men want their morals ready made,
and they search for a yardstick by
which to measure them, in this
search reason is ignored.
Yet in the very nature of things
there can be no infallible reason.
A craving for some accessible re
sort where the pure and holy may
be found undefiled has created all
the places of worship in the world.
The divine agency for which men
seek may be found in the Bible,
which is God's book for man, writ
ten by man's pen for man's use.
But it is not, infallible. If you
want to glean truth from an infal
lible book you must have an infal
lible interpreter and an infallible
listener.
Our reason and moral sense deter
mine what religion we get. It is
the man himself who is the author
ity, not the church, not the book.
We should not handicap our in
ner consciousness with formulas or
rules. No authority can be infal
lible, and the insight comes to a
man when he looks past the church,
past the book to the Spirit itself.
The Bible is the land under feet,
a lamp in our path; the Church is
a city on a hill, or a beacon forever
before our gaze, guiding us through
the darkness; but greater than these
is the coming of the spirit of man
into communication with the spirit
of God.
