Stanford is so young that even
now freshmen may help to found
what in future years will he time
honored customs dating hack into
the unremembered past. Last night
a group of students on the Inn ver
anda had a "college sing." This
gathering of students at dusk to
sing college songs is a custom of
older colleges worthy of institution
at Stanford. Heretofore the only
place at all suitable has been the
steps of Encina, which are cold,
hard, and uncomfortable, and not
so accessible to all students as the
more centrally located Inn.
