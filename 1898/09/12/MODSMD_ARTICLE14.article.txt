If the world owes the student a
living, it is not because he is a
student, but because he has made
the world his debtor by good, earn
est work of one sort or another.
The negro who had been praised
for her careful speech said, when
reproved because her room was
dirty, u Yo kaintexpect good gram
ma' an' clean corners from de same
darkey." Symmetrical education
is fast proving that clean corners
and correct speech are compatible,
that good work is good work
whether in the household or in col
lege departments. The deft hand
and the observant eye are necessary
in waiting on thetable as well its in
preparing specimens for the micro
scope. Whoever expects to receive
pay because he is a student rather
than because he does his work well,
makes a grave mistake. In his
laudable effort to help himself, he
must not forget the business prop
osition. Other things being equal,
students should be preferred as
workers. It is the part of the stud
ent to make equal those "other
things."
