Last Monday, after a thorough
overhauling, Lauro Hall was
opened f or this year. Jt will be
run directly by the business office
as Encina and Roble are. Only
young ladies will be admitted and
the dining-room will not be open,
the residents getting their meals
wherever they choose. The price
of rooms runs from live to sixteen
dollars, which includes light, heat,
and service and the room furnish
ings, as at the other halls,occupants
supplying their own bedding, etc.
At Lauro, however, the rent is
fixed for the room without regard
to whether one or two occupy it,
the price being the same in either
case.
Miss Macgillivray is matron of
the hall.
