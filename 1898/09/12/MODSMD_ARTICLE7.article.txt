# FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
## A 						Number of Candidates Made Their First Appearance on Our Gridiron Last Friday. 
### 
Between thirty and forty men
were on the gridiron Friday even
ing. The four Varsity men, the
sole remains of last year's team,
were on the Held the first time this
season.
Murphy's punting is, as is usual
at the first of the season, somewhat
erratic. His lengthy kicks at times,
however, presaged a probable im
provement when he gets into some
thing like form.
Several freshmen pleased the
football cranks who were onlookers.
Chief among these was Geissler,
whose punting was a surprise to
many.
The following men made their
first appearance Friday evening:
11. Smith, Parker, Murphy, Hay
den, MacKinnon, Gage, Cairnes,
Allen, Rodolph, Geissler, Beedy,
Hough, Anderson, Parkin, Clinton,
Gilman, Faris, Gray, Sell.
