# DEMAND OF THE OLYMPICS.
## The 						Club Wants Eighty-Five Percent of the Proceeds. 
### 
Last evening's practice did not
differ to any extent from the work
of previous evenings. Several new
men were out. As yet but few heavy
men are to be seen on the gridiron.
This week will possibly bring out
some heavy freshmen, if Captain
Fisher's efforts count for anything.
The controversy between the
managements of the two universi
ties and the Olympic Club still
wages merrily.
hast year the athletic club teams
received sixty per cent, of the net
receipts of games in which they
played. This year the Olympic
Club demanded a greater allowance.
Upon the refusal of the managment
to accede to this, they offered to let
the two universities manage their
team, paying all its expenses. This
offer did not meet with the approval
of either Acting Manager Berry otf
Treasurer Fickert.
The following telegram was re
ceived here today:
Charles Fickkkt,
Stanford University, Cal.
Club's final proposition. Eighty
live per cent. Varsity guaranteeing
six games. Percy Morse.
Stanford's management is unani
mous in the declaration that the
club's per cent, must be less.
U [> to noon today thirty-six suits
had been given out.
Regarding the grounds Acting
Manager Berry said, ''We will have
water hauled to the gridiron today
between 5 p.m. and midnight. To
morrow morning teams will start
work to get the grounds in shape
for a line-up whenever Captain
Fisher is ready."
A letter was received Irom Coach
Cross yesterday in which he said
he would be delayed a few days,
and would not arrive at Stanford
until about the 21st.
Captain Fisher received a letter
from "Billy" McLeod, saying he
would be here on the 15th.
