# Student Employment.
## 
### 
The work of finding employment
for students at Stanford has been
done since the opening of the Uni
versity by a committee of profes
sors. Last year a permanent or
ganization, known as the Students'
Aid Committee, was formed. Its
single object is to bring together
those having work to be done and
students desiring employment.
The students who have put them
selves through college with credit
to the institution and to themselves
show that this has been well
done.
Such students say that there is
plenty of work here for one who
knows how to find it and how to
do it. The man who can turn his
hand to anything or who can do
any one thing better than anybody
else is already provided for. For
the rest there is table work,
the heavier cleaning about a house,
the care of horse or cow. or gar
den work. Supplementary kitchen
work, Mich as washing dishes and
preparing vegetable*, is more easily
obtained than any other; in fact,
these places can not always be
tilled.
Working without a salaried of
ficer and entirely without pay, tne
Students' Aid Coiumittte have put j
into places in Palo Alto and on
the campus fifty students this|
\ ear.
It is an advantage that these
places should lie supplied by the
commit tee rather than by individ
ual application, for the committee j
send each student to the phue for
which he is liest fitted and hold
themselves in a measure respon
sible for him.
It can not be too earnestly urged
that no student should enter the
University without means to carry
him through one semester. If he
could not earn and save that
amount where he was well known,
there is small chance that he will
do it here where he is a stranger.
During his second semester and
thereafter he should be able to earn
his expenses in whole or in part.
Those who have work to he done
are asked to bear in mind that in
this large body there are those who
can do acceptably almost anv kind
of work. Many of the students
have learned trades, many have
taught, or have been stenographers
or clerks. If there are electric hells
or panes to be put in or books ti he
kept or dishes to be washed or |
porches to be cleaned, there is prob
ably a Stanford student eager for
the work and prepared to do the
work well.
Mr. J. E. McDowell, the secretary
of the committee, may he seen at
the Registrar's ollice between three
and four in the afternoon. I'rof.
Griffin, the chairman of the com
mittee, is also ready to refer those
interested to efficient student help.;
