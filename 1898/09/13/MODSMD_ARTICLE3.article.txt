# DEATH OF MRS. BARNES.
## The 						Sad News of the Passing Away of a Former Stanford Professor. 
### 
The tidings of the death of Mary
Sheldon Barnes was brought to her
lilends and the students in the
University today by memorial
cards, but no further word has
been received. Always a frail
woman, she had comparatively
good health while at Stanford, but
her students will remember that
her will-power rather than her
physical strength enabled her to
teach and write. While her death
brings a sense of loss to University
students, it is, to those who worked
with her, a personal bereavement.
Mrs. Barnes' father was for
twenty years president of the Os
wego, New York, State Normal,
where she taught Greek, Latin,
and history after her graduation
from Michigan University. After
holding a professorship of history
at Wellesley College for two years
she studied modern history at
Cambridge, England, and later at
Zurich and at the British Museum.
When Professor Earl Barnes was
asked to found the department of
Education and came to Stanford as
one of the original faculty, Mrs.
Barnes ajcompanied him to lend
her friendship and rare personality
to faculty and students, to make
her home one of the centers of de
lightful social intercourse, and
later to take a professorship in
Pacific Coast History. Her work
in that line will be more fully ap
preciated by later California histor
ians than it can be now. It may
be said to have opened a new field
for research. It has made the
Stanford Museum a gathering
place for many treasures connected
with our early history.
Among Mrs. Barnes' published
works are "Studies in General His
tory," 1885, of which 1). C. Heath,
her publisher, is now putting out a
new edition. It was accompanied
by a manual for teachers. Her
"American History," in which Pro
fessor Barnes assisted, was also ac
companied by "Studies in American
History," for teachers. Beside her
books, she has contributed valuable
articles to such magazines as the
American Historical licvicxo and the
Papular Science Monthly.
Mrs. Barnes died at 38 Blooms
bury Street, London, W. C., where
she and her husband, aHer a year
of Continental travel, were studying
at the British Museum.
