# Glee Club Try-Out.
## 
### 
About twenty new candidates
for the varsity Glee Club appeared
at the annual try-out in the chapel
at 3:30 Friday afternoon. The
voiceH were tested as to range and
quality by Mr. J. J. Morris of Palo
Alto in the presence of the execu
tive committee, composed of A. .J.
Van Kaathoven, '99, leader, J. F.
Lanagan, '00, and F. B. Riley, '00.
Among the candidates at least
three or four good voices were dis
covered. The freshman class fur
nished the bulk of the new material,
its candidates, though few in num
ber, proving to be especially desir
able men.
The lirst bass and second tenor
voices being plentiful there was a
wide range of choice among them.

At least two first tenors were re
cruited. These voices were parti
cularly needed. No especially good
timber was discovered for second
bass, but the part will be strong
notwithstanding.
The committee is well satisfied
with the showing made at the try
out, and the prospects in everyway
indicate that the high reputation
the club holds all over the Pacific
Coast will be wholly sustained this
year.
The club is fortunate in having
a nucleus of old men. Among them
are Van Kaathoven, '99, first bass
and leader; Riley, '00, first tenor
and the club's entertainer; Lana
gan, '00, second bass and soloist;
Dawson, '00, and Maxwell, '99, first
tenors; Hush, '98, Schneider, '98,
and Rodolph, '01, second tenors;
Strohn, '00, and Drake, '01, first
bass; and (Jilman, 01, and Ross, '01,
second bass. Riley's fellow come
dians, Dillon, ex-'99, and Rosbor
ough, '01, will be missed this year.
