The appointment of a committee
to interview the University author
ities for the purpose of deciding
upon a definite and permanent lo
cation for our athletic fields, brings
up a question of much importance
t,o the student body and one which
merits most careful consideration.
Upon first thought there are few of
us who would not rather let the
fields remain where they now are
than to make any change in their
location. But we are forced to con
sider the questions which are likely
to perplex us in the future unless
some final settlement is brought
about at once. If the student body
should spend a large sum in im
proving one part of the campus
and should then he forced to
up that location to make room for
buildings or other improvements
planned by the University author
ities, it would prove almost disas
trous to athletics until a new loca
tion could be secured and improved.
The all-important thing now is to
find out definitely where the stud
ents can have a place of their own
without fear of molestation, where
every dollar spent in improvements
can be counted toward a definite
plan. We have wasted a great deal
of money heretofore by our shifting
policies. The amount spent use
lessly each year would enable us in
a few years to furnish our athletes
with every convenience and facility
for practice if spent with a definite
purpose in view. So let us give
this matter a free discussion and
settle it once for all. The com
mittee appointed by the president
of the student body is well fitted to
consider the question in all its
phases, and their report will do
much to determine what our decis
ion shall be.
