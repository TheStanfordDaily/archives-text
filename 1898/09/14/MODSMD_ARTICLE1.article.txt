# LAST NIGHT'S LECTURE.
## Professor Fetter Gives an Able Talk on Social Progress and Race Degeneration. 
### 
The usual Tuesday evening lec
ture was delivered last night by
l'rofessor Frank A. Fetter, whose
subject was "Social progress and
race degeneration."
The thought of progress per
vades all the studies of the times,
began the lecturer. Evolution,
from star-dust to suns, from
molten mass to habitable earth,
from stone to plant and living
creature, from the ganglion of the
oyster to the brain of man, from
flint arrow-head to modern war
ship, from savage tribe to federa
tion of republics--in all we see a
growth toward higher forms and
better things. We are accustomed
to look upon this as a providential,
constant, and inevitable fact.
It is not disputing the proposi
tion that where ignorance is bliss
it is folly to be wise, to insist that
ignorance usually gives a sense of
temporary security at the cost ot
later suffering. The progress we
see is, it is true, providential, but
it has by no means been uniform,
constant, and it does not appear to
be inevitable.
With growth goes what we call
decay, which is but another name
for growth; with progress in some
lines goes decay in others; with
evolution, degeneration. For every
case of the surviving and successful
social institution or instrument
there have been a thousand tried
and rejected. Progress has resulted
from the stress and strain of com
petition. Suspend the struggle
and progress stops.
The other view of the problem is
in apparent contradiction to this.
In the earlier stages of animal evo
lution another element is present,
taking the form of combination be
tween creatures of the same species,
sacrifice of self for others, as is
seen in the case of parents, even
in low forms of life, in the growth of
sympathies and liner sentiments in
evolving societies. Combination
seems to favor progress better than
competition alone. Sacrifice favors
better than selfishness the survival
of the species. Sympathy and
benevolence are indispensable to
the development of social institu
tions above the grade of savagery.
This is a paradox, to explain
which is a task for the moralist,
the naturalist, the historian, and
the student of sociology. Is our
social progress self-destructive?—
the old problem of the origin of
evil. Why have not the thousand
ills that man is heir to been ban
ished by the knowledge and skill of
man? Darwin saw that it was by
the survival of the strongest, the
most cunning, those most fitted to
meet the diflicn 1 ties of their sur
roundings, that the general average
of muscle, brain, and organization
had constantly risen in the animal
kingdom.
The condition of savages in the
earlier stages is not very different
from that of animals. In many
ways the weaker and less capable
members of the tribe are exposed
to destruction. Hence the high
standard of the average physical

condition. In this stage it is a
problem of zoology rather than one
of sociology. The same influences
were at work upon our Germanic
ancestors in the plains'and forests
of Europe.
In the medieval period of Euro
pean history we see a number of
influences less favorable to health
and vigor. The Church drew within
its sterile walls tens of thousands
of those best titled to be parents of
succeeding generations. Terrific
epidemics and frequent famines
ravaged every country of Europe
until the present century. Free
dom from famine is one of* the
greatest achievements of progress,
but it removes one of the most
potent agents for eliminating the
lesj capable members of society.
Another result of progress is the
greater protection afforded by better
clothing and housing. The imme
diate benefits resulting are so great
as to make any mention of accom
panying disadvantages seem at
first mere jesting, but that ultimate
power of resistance to disease will
be thereby weakened is a fact there
is no escaping. "Weaker and
wiser," the proverb of our fore
fathers, takes on a new meaning
thus interpreted. A large part of
our population thus enabled to
arrive at maturity and to become
the parents of another generation
would have been too weak to have
survived the period of childhood i i
older and ruder times.
Another influence at work has
been the gradually changing mode
of warfare. The progress of civili
zation has not yet brought about
the abolition of war, but it has suc
ceeded in exactly reversing the in
fluence it once had in the elevation
of the physical, and in some re
spects we may also say the intel
lectual, standard of the race.
In social activities and in peace
ful pursuits such forces as the mar
riage customs, the higher age at
marriage, city life, the division of
labor, the opening of business and
professions to women, and the
growth of modern altruism, the
progressive methods for the edu
cation of the blind and the deaf,
have all been working in the same
way.
In conclusion he said: The fore
going may appear like a lugubri
ous catalogue of evils, but in all
the cases cited of the influence of
science and invention, it is the ulti
mate or indirect working only that
is evil. The immediate effect was
what we call good—the relief of
suffering, the lengthening of life,
the making possible of happiness
to the afflicted or unfortunate.
There would indeed be full cause
for pessimism if there were no
means possible of averting these
evils. The postponement of death,
the prevention of disease, the al
leviation of suffering, may all
safely continue, and for the old
ruthless and brutal elimination of
the unlit be substituted a rational
and scientific process of selection.
The race must be continued by its
best and not by its worst elements
considered morally, intellectually,
and physically. Just what partic
ular measures should be adopted
we shall not attempt to discuss.
But we may confidently predict

that the more intelligent sympathy
of the future will demand that
misery be not merely alleviated,
but that it will be no longer trails -
mitted as a curse to posterity. A
more truly sympathetic intelligence
will find methods, not merely of
temporizing with the miseries of
the race, but of lifting the general
average of health, intellectual vigor,
and happiness with each succeeding
generation.
