third its original cost, which is
given here.
The net profits of $1,558.58 are
not in the form of cash. Most of
this amount is in the form of un
sold books, while some of it has
been invested remodeling the build
ing, and in furniture, catalogues,
etc. The various items are as fol

The directors have attempted to
attain two main purposes in con

ducting tlie business of the Book
store, namely, efficiency and low
prices. Of these, efficiency was
considered of primary importance.
It was believed that all would pre
fer to be served promptly and in
telligently rather than save a few
cents on the dollar by delay and
unintelligent service. To attain
this purpose it was necessary to
employ a manager of experience
and special knowledge,and to use the
telegraph and the express in many
cases. It was also necessary to pur
chase expensive catalogues, and to
remodel and refit the building. All
this has made the expense account
larger than it was in the case of the
Co-operative Association. However,
a comparison of prices shows that
the Bookstore is selling books to
every one at prices over four per
cent, lower than the Co-operative
Association sold to its members, and
fourteen per cent, lower than it sold
to non-members. As only one
third of the students were mem
bers, it seems safe to say that stu
dents on the average obtain books
ten per cent, lower than formerly.
This would make the saving to stu
dents last year over $2,000.
Although expenses were larger
and prices lower last year, yet the
increase of fifty per cent, in the
amount of the sales enabled the
Bookstore to show a balanje of net
profits at the end of the year
amounting to about $1,550. A por
tion of these profits ($300) went to
pay for remodeling and refitting
the building, a small portion ($100)
was in cash, while about $1,150 was
in the form of unsold merchandise.
About one-third ($500) of the net
profits was made on the sale of the
old stock bought of the Co-opera
tive Association.
The Bookstore is hampered at
present by inadequate room and
inadequate capital. The present
store is very small for a business of
over twenty thousand dollars an
nually. The original capital was
obtained by borrowing $1,500, se
cured by the personal liability of
the members. Because of the large
amount of unsold books at the end
of the year, it was impossible to
pay any of it off. It has seemed to
the members of the Bookstore good
policy to pay off this borrowed
money as soon as possible, thus
saving interest, and to accumulate
capital sufficient to enable the store
to buy in larger quantities and at
better prices. This will require the
store to gain a small amount over
expenses for a few years. It will
then be possible to make prices
lower than they are at present.
