Morning chapel has been abol
ished largely on account of ihe fact
that students did not attend he
cause of the early hour. It would
be impracticable with 8:15 recita
tions; hut even in previous years,
when the hour began at 8:80, the
chapel service was not popular, and
last year, when the experiment was
made, it was found that the vesper
service was more attractive to the
student body as a whole, and it has
been retained and is now the only
general religious meeting during
the week. There are enough stu
dents in the University who desire
such a meeting to make it a success.
The success of the vesper depends
considerably upon the number who
take part, especially as it consists
largely of singing.
