# A 						LETTER FROM SWITZER.
## He Writes From the Philippines A bout Stanford Men Under Fire. 
### 
A letter was received last week
by Alfred Haslacher, '00, from
John M. Switzer, 'DB, dated '"Camp
Dewey, Philippines, August 6."
He writes as follows:
"It is hard work for us. We
have almost constant rains and
seldom have all of our clothes dry.
We dare not sleep on the ground for
fear of fever. Two weeks ago we
were on outpost duty. With our
first lieutenant, we went five
miles from camp to within a hun
dred yards of the Spanish entrench
ments.
"Last. Saturday night the Spanish
made an attack on our lines. The
Pennsylvanians and regulars were
in the fortifications about one mile
from Manila's walls. On the fol
lowing night the foe again attacked
while the Pennsy lvanians were
throwing up entrenchments. The
California troops were called out to
reinforce them and arrived just as
the Pennsyl vanians had almost
exhausted their supply of ammuni
tion. The Spanish artillery threw
shell after shell at us from the
walls ot Manila. One killed Cap
tain Richter. We buried him this
morning. We killed twelve Span
iards. At 11:30 p.m. we were called
out to reinforce in a drenching rain,
with the mud a foot deep. Monday
morning K Company (Stanford)
was stationed across the Manila
road, under desultory fire all day,
the bullets pecking the bamboo
trees overhead. In the afternoon
Thomas, Lull, White, Corbusier,
and 1 were sitting chatting in a
hut to the right of the road when
suddenly live Mauser bullets sifted
right between us. You should have
seen us drop to the ground and
crawl to the fortifications! The en
trenchments were in a low country
and the ditches behind them, where
we were forced to lie, were brim
full of water from the frequent
rains. We never dared to put a
head over the breastworks. 'Duck
your nut' was the cry all day to
those who would forget their posi
tion and lift their heads. A hat
stuck over the edge would draw the
fire in that direction.
In the afternoon Leavitt and a
Mr. Conway did some dangerous
outpost duty under a heavy lire.
They came in just as we were ready
to go to their rescue. At dusk fir
ing began all along the lines. In
a few moments the earth trembled
from the artillery lire from both
sides, while the infantry lire seemed
like a veritable Fourth of July.
No o e was hurt, as the shells
missed us, some, however, by not
over thirty feet. Just at the close
of the firing my major told me to
take tny squad and ten men from
F Company and to extend the
trenches into the rice fields to the
left. Chet Thomas was sergeant
in the line along the house. lie
and 1 took charge. Most o* us
left our guns in the hut, as it was
raining torrents. With two hun
dred rounds of ammunition one
can not do much more than handle
a shovel half properly in the dark
rain and mud. After building to
the edge of the woods we dashed
into the open rice fields. We were

working for a long time in a neg
lected field, the Spanish having an
open sweep at us from some hushes
ahead. Chet and 1 were alone for
forty-five minutes putting men to
work here in weeds and in water
three to four injhes deep. We put
out men in a skirmish line to pro
tect those who were working. The
Spaniards hearing us dig and
splash in the water sent shots at
us from their outposts. The bul
lets whizzed past us, some ducked,
some stood still, hut all kept work
ing. About 9:30 when we had
thirty men working and thirty out
skirmishing a number of bullets
came right in our midst, cutting
down the weeds by our side. More
firing and every one squatted or
lay down in th<# mud and water.
Firing came faster. The men on
the extreme right had nothing in
front of them, for not more than
three inches of dirt was thrown up
there. Stowe and I were there
with the others. Some of us lay
on the ground and put shovels in
front of us. Firing came faster
and we plunged into the ditch on
our left. We opened volley fire.
The left opened a cross fire. The
Coloradoans on the right followed
suit. After a while the Spaniards
let up. We had been behind three
feet of earthworks with our bodies
completely underwater. We stayed
this way until one o'clock Tuesday
morning when we moved back to
a line of skirmishers twenty feet in
the rear, where we lay in three
inches of water. We were finally
relieved, but stayed in the woods.
At dawn we repulsed an incipient
attack at the same point. The
Dons then slowly retreated under
cover of their fire. Shells burst all
around. Three of our fellows had
bullet holes in their guns and two
had holes in their hats. In the
next company a man was shot in
the head: Ten feet from me an
other was hit in the shoulder. A
shell struck a few feet from our
company.
Next night there was more fight
ing, then quiet until last (Friday)
night when extremely heavy artill
ery firing was heard. We all put
on our fighting outfits and filled
our canteens. It causes a strange
feeling to see the flash and to hear
the roar of the enemy's cannon
and to know that you may have
an order any second to march
straight into that fire. Twenty of
our men were killed and fifty
wounded.
Last evening as we were watch
ing the flash of the Manila guns
and hearing their roar it was no
uncommon sight to see a fellow
run into his tent and write a few
lines or go to some particular
friend and give him orders to fulfill
in case he himself should fall and
the other fellow should be more
fortunate. I have not seen a Stan
ford man falter. Let the boys at
home know that Stanford's good
name is sacredly preserved even on
the battle-field
My tentmate is a, German gen
tleman, a newspaper man who has
been through two wars, and he said
that we fellows in the ditch the
other night acquitted ourselves
well iti a hard position.
We are ready to go to the
trenches at anv moment. As 1

write two dead bodies are being
carried into camp. Three were
killed last night and six wounded.
None of us want to get out of the
army. We are cheerfully standing
the hardships and are willing to
scrap. l>ut when the war is over
and the Stars and Stripes is re
spected, honored and victorious
here and in Cuba, none but the
language of the gods will express
our joy in marching once more up
Market street. Let them all know
that we, 7,500 miles from our coun
try's shore, shall do our duty here
and at the same time wish dear old
Stanford all the success this year
she has enjoyed in the past.
