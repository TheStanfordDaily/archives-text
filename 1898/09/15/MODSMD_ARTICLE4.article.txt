# Heavier Practice Yesterday.
## 
### 
The football squad were given
heavier practice yesterday after
noon, falling on the ball, following
kicks, and tackling.
Several clever runs were made,
Bard, Dole, and Geissler excelling
in this particular. The freshmen
for the most part showed poor form
in tackling, often overrunning the
man.
Large freshmen are needed, and
now that the field is in shape more
of the first year men should appear
in order that the Freshman team
may be organized as soon as pos
si hie.
Francis " Billy" McLeod arrived
on the campus today, and will be
gin work on the men at once.
