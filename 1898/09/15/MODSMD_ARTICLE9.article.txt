The early interest this year in
all brunches of student body activ
ity is encouraging. The other even
ing representatives of all four im
portant athletic sports were out at
the same time. To be sure, there
is some danger if too much work is
done on the track and baseball field
so early, but if discretion is used,
work done this semester will show
in results next spring. The musical
clubs have taken in a number of
men who have begun practicing
with the old members. The debat
ing societies are well attended and
interest seems to be more wide
spread than it was last year. In
all directions, the "Stanford spirit"
is seen to be at work and the year
has begun well.
