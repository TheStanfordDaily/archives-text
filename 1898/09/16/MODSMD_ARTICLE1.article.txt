# EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.
## Student Body Business Transacted and Discussed at the Meeting Yesterday Afternoon. 
### 
The Executive Committee met
yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock in
room 11 quad with the following
members present: President
Schwartz,'99; A m01d,'99; Edwards,
'00; Cantwell, '01; and Miss Tucker,
'99.
After considering in executive
session several matters connected
with the Thanksgiving game, the
committee gave its attention to
various bills which had been pre
sented for the settlement of claims
left unpaid at the close of last year.
With one exception these bills were
all allowed, and a committee was
appointed to investigate the merits
of this unallowed claim and report
at the next meeting.
The committee then took up the
matter of the piano which is now
in the chapel, and a letter was read
from the owner of it asking imme
diate action or the return of the
piano to the city. Last year the
piano was offered to the student
body for $375 in cash, or for $200
in cash and $200 balance due
within one year. Last year's Exec
utive Committee voted $200 for the
first payment on the piano, and
about $75 was turned into the stud
ent body treasury from the enter
tainment given by the Faculty
Dramatic Club, to be applied for
this purpose. This left the sum of
$275 in the student body treasury
to be used for this purpose, but
the sum was never paid over. Thus
the matter now stands, and the city
dealer demands the return of the
piano or the payment of the
amount agreed upon.
It was argued in the committee
that the student body did not have
sufficient use for the piano to jus
tify its purchase at this time. It
was generally understood when the
matter came up last year that the
members of the faculty would raise
half the amount necessary if the
student body appropriated the rest..
This they did not appear will
ing to do, and the additional bur
den would now fall upon the student
body.
It was moved and seconded that
the matter be dropped, and that
the owner be allowed to take pos
session of the piano. Upon further
discussion the motion was with
drawn and in its stead one was
made providing for a committee of
one to consult with those interested
in retaining the piano, and to see
if they were willing to help bear
the expense of keeping it. The
chair appointed Mr. Edwards on
this ootnmittee.
At the request of Mr. Arnold,
fifteen dollars was voted to buy
music for the Mandolin Club
The meeting then adjourned.
