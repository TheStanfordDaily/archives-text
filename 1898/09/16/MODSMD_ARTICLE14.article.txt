The University of California has
been unusually fortunate of late.
Within the last few years there have
been given to the university, out
side of smaller endowments, the
Hopkins Art Gallery and School of
Art, the Wilmerding School of
Mechanical Arts, and munificent
gifts from Mrs. Phoebe Hearst.
Now comes a rich donation from
Miss Cora Jane Flood of the pala
tial Flood mansion at Menlo Park,
with other lands, buildings, and
water-works stock of an estimated
value of $2,000,000. This with the

increase in the tax levy for the uni
versity will more than double the
university's income. We congrat
ulate our sister university on the
increased facilities which are thus
made possible.
