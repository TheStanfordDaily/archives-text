# UNIVERSITY BOOKSTORE.
## Outline of the Form of Organization of That Institution. 
### 
As there is some misunderstand
ing in the University concerning
the management of the University
Bookstore, we give below an out
line of its form of organization.
The Bookstore is organized under
a law of California providing for
the incorporation, operation, and
management of co-operative associ
ations." iu its articles of incorpor
ation its purpose iB stated to be " to
carry on a general mercantile busi
ness for the accommodation of the
students and faculty of Leland
Stanford Jr. University." The
membership fee is iixed by the same
articles at one dollar.
In order that the property of the
Bookstore may never be diverted
to the private advantage of the
members, it is provided in the by
laws that " the pecuniary in
terest of a member in the assets of
the Bookstore shall be the amount
of his membership fee paid in,
namely, one dollar, and no more;
and no interest or dividend shall
be paid upon such membership fee;
nor shall a y distribution of profits
or assets be made to members."
The profits, if any, must be added
to the common property of the
Bookstore. It is also provided that
members shall not receive any pref
erence in the matter of prices over
I.on-mem hers —also that the direct
ors and officers shall receive no
compensation for their services.
In case of the dissolution of the
Bookstore it is provided that the
net assets be " applied to any edu
cational, charitable, or benevolent
institution or purpose."
Although it is thus impossible
for the members to receive legally
any profits or benefits which are
not received in common with every
member of the University, on the
other hand, each member is liable
personally for his proportion of the
debts of the Bookstore. If disaster
should come to the Bookstore, such
as tire without insurance, or defal
cation of any employee, the loss
would fall wholly on the members.
Since there is no advantage in
being a member, the membership
will probably always remain small.
It is necessary that the member
ship should be large enough to di
vide the financial responsibility,
yet small enough for every member
to take a personal interest in the
management of the business. At
present there are thirteen members.
The present board of directors
consists of Professors 11. L. Green,
president; A. B. Show, secretary;
and .J. O. Griffin, L. M. Hoskins,
and G. M. Richardson. The other
members of the association are Pro
fessors Gilbert, Lathrop, Kellogg,
Ross, Wing, Branner, Fairclough,
and Whittier.
