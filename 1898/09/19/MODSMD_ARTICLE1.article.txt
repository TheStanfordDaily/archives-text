# THE 						SUNDAY SERMON.
## Dr. Stebbins Talks to the Students On the Subject, " God is Love." 
### 
The usual Sunday sermon was
delivered by Dr. Stebbins. The
subject was, "God is love."
Among the many conquests of
science in the material world we
are apt to forget the greater change
in the realm of thought. But as
the spiritual relations become more
deep, we feel that God is nigh.
The most precious conquest of mod
ern theology is the realization of
St. Paul's conception: "One God —
Father of all —above all —through
all."
Being has its climax in love —
and God is love. Goodness that
haß to be proved is weak and im
perfect. We have only to retire to
the citadels of our hearts to see
God as the counsellor of love.
Love exists everywhere, in the
creature as well as the human
world. 1 see a flash of the love of
the present God in the mother-bird
courting the fowler's bullet that
her brood may escape.
What is love? It is that which
leads us out of ourselves, which
makes us forget ourselves. It
forms the bond of the family, and
the family is the basis of civiliza
tion.
Society could not exist without
this love. There is much low, four
footed talk of the marriage con
tract. It is an attempt at adapta
tion to a lower plane of thought.
Society is not the product of a bar
gain, any more than the flash of
love in young eyes, or the thrill of
love in young hearts is a mere cal
culation of profit and loss.
And what is the hope of the
world? That this spark of love
will never be extinguished. It
never has been; it has burned in
private hearts, and on the moun
tain-tops of history, in the love of
mother and child, in the song and
story of youth and maiden, in the
communion of kindred minds. It
grows without care —the more you
lavish it, the more it increases.
There are times when religion
seems a dream and honor a
shadow. But the fire still burns.
After all, this world is the only one
God could have; and he would
rather have his family as it is—
weak, wretched, ignorant —than to
grow old in His house without a
chink or a child.
If the world is improving, it is
because the love of God is spread
ing. For all our improvements
are but the furniture of a proud
mansion. The only advancement
is in the growth of moral life.
The repositories of this love are
individual men and women, every
day people such as we, were we
wise enough to see and to believe.
It is this love that gives courage
and manly strength in times of
stress and war. This love is the
reinforcing motive upon which so
ciety depends. It is a beam of
light and heat that comes unsought
through chinks and cracks, and
casts glorj' on the rudest walls. It
increases youth, and conserves the
soul. It is pure religion and per
fect morality. It changes the
climate of our hearts, and makes
us realize the prayer, "Thy king
dom come." God is that love. To

smile at it is blasphemy: to treat it
as a dream is despair. For "God
so loved the world, and for that
cause the world is."
