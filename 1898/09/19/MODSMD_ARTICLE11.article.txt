Law students would do well to
heed the warning of Prof. Abbott
in regard to the use of the Law
Library. Since such strict rules
are being enforced in the general
Library, the opening of the Law
Library to all students, at all t iines.
is a high privilege, which should
not be abused. Proper care of the
books and the recognition of the
rights of other students will enable
the students to use this Library
freely; otherwise it is liable to come
under the general regulations.
