graduate work liere last year, line
been appointed assistant professor
of hisUuy in the Washington Stale
Agricultural College.
I'iie following extract from a pri
vate letter will be of interest to
those who remember the man who
was the first vice-president of the
student, body, the second editor-in
chief of the Daily Palo Alto, and
at one time president of the Class
of '93:
" Our old friend Carl Schurz
Smith, '93, seems to be doing fairly
well in a legal way and prospering
here in Honolulu, but from a little
yarn 1 heard the other day it would
seetn that he might be making
more. He was over on the Island
of Hawaii recently attending the
Circuit Court. While there he de
fended a man accused of selling
" booze" without a license. After
clearing his client on a technical
ity, he did not know how much to
strike him for, so he sought the ad
vice of tne Japanese interpreter.
He wanted to know if ten dollars
would be too much of a fee. " Holy
smoke!'' exclaimed the interpreter,
,l ten dollars!" So Smith said he
would make it only five. The in
terpreter told me about it afterward
and said that one hundred dollars
would have been a low fee. This
simply goes to show how the fees
here compare with those in the
States."
