## Incidents of the Trip and Interesting Items Concerning Stanford Men at the Front. 
### 
The following interesting letter
written by a Stanford boy to the
Daily Palo Alto has just been re
ceived from Manila :
Camp Dewey, July 27, 1898.
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The Stanford boys in the U. S.
Ariny in the Philippines thought
you and Stanford friends might be
interested in knowing something of
what we have been doing. I shall
not attempt to cover the whole
ground, for we have but a few hours
before mail leaves and must write
in our crowded tents under very
great disadvantages. At another
time we shall speak of the natives,
the country, the war, etc.
It is difficult for us to realize all
that has been crowded into the
brief two and a half months of our
service for Uncle Sam. Our war
meetings in Encina Hall,our drills
on the football lieid when some of
you called us tin soldiers, our de
parture from the beloved quad and
friends, our examination and en
listment, our camp at the Presidio,
with a strange mixture of wind
and sand, rain and mud, our visit
ing friends, our memorable march
to the transports and no less mem
orable departure from the bay, the
voyage to Honolulu, the royal re
ception there and the Stanford
banquet, the long voyage to Guam
and its picturesque capture, tiie
crossing of the rough China sea,
the meeting of the Baltimore, the
entrance into Manila Hay, the
meeting with Dewey and his fam
ous squadron, the sight of the
sunken Spanish Meet, the landing
in Caviie, the nightly roar of Span
ish and insurgent conflicts, the
coming of the second and third ex
peditions, the advance toward the
enemy to our present position un
der the guns of Manila, all pass in
rapid review before us. But after
all the step is not so long from a
good loyal Stanford student to a
brave, patriotic American soldier.
He must be a depraved Ameri
can whose heart does not throb
with enthusiasm and patriotism at
the tributes and farewells San
Francisco paid us when we left our
native shore. Some cold, severe
scientists may depreciate the value
of such a display, but it has
cheered us on many disagreeable
occasions. The reception Hono
lulu gave us is a green spot in our
memory. The beautiful native
song of welcome, Aloha, was on
every tongue, The feast for 3,000
set in the Government buildings
makes us still long for Honolulu.
We have nothing but praise and
gratitude for Honolulu in general
and the Stanford alumni there in
particular.
We were three days out from
Honolulu when it was first known
that we were to capture Guam.
The long voyage in the sultry trop
ics, with daily rains, crowded ves
sels, insufficient exercise, and com
plaint about-food, was not a source
of much pleasure. Major Tilden
attributes the excellent condition
of the Pekin troops when they
landed here to the gymnasium ex
ercises the Stanford boys intro

duced on board ship. No other
exercise was possible under the
crowded circumstances. Every
soldier was vaccinated, some suf
fering intensely as a result.
The monotony of the voyage was
relieved by a Thirtieth of May cele
tion, suggested at the last moment
by a Stanfordite, and two enter
tainments.
At Guam word was received that
Thompson, 'DO, on board the Syd
ney, had died. We lamented his
fate until to our astonishment and
delight we met him on the streets
of Cavite soon after landing.
On June 80, after a voyage of
thirty-five days, over 8,000 miles of
sea, we steamed up Manila Bay. 1
dare not attempt to express our
feelings at the thunder of Dewey's
salute at the sight of our victorious
fleet holding at bay a harbor full
of vessels and having around it a
stockade of masts of sunken Span
ish men-of-war.
We were three days landing. Our
quarters in Cavite were tiie old
Spanish barracks. Here and there
a shattered wall or pierced roof
bear witness of Dewey's marksman
ship. The hospital where our sick
lay was, three months before, the
scene of slaughter by the natives
of thirty sick and wounded Span
iards. Twenty feet from our beds
was a grave holding, it is said, the
remains of over one hundred Span
ish dead. The sunken Spanish
vessels were so near to our barracks
that the stench of decaying bodies
came to our quarters on the hot
afternoon winds. In and about
Cavite are 5,000 Spanish prisoners
guarded by the insurgents. They
are confined in the old stone prisons
built by their ancestors '200 years
or more ago for the purpose of sub
jecting rebellious natives. The old
stone sea wall is both a fortifica
tion and a prison. There are also
sealed dungeons with flesh less
bodies still chained to the floor.
The churches and prisons are side
by, side often parts_of the same
building. Other portions of the
world have seen similar pictures.
All these churches but one are now
plundered in a manner that would
do justice to a Protestant army of
the Reformation.
On Juty 20 we crossed the neck
of the bay and are now in Camp
Dewey, one mile from Manila.
I must close now for want of
time. We are "all well but Hart
well, who is not seriously ill. All
the Stanford boys send best re
gards to friends and well wishes to
the University as a whole.
A Stanford Boy.
Camp Dewey, Manila.
