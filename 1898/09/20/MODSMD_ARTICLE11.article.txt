considerable expense to cover and
put in perfect condition the billiard
table in the assembly room, so that
a ganie of billiards is once more a
pleasure. Last year the marring
(it tiie cloth was due to gross care
lessness .on the part of certain in
dividuals, making necessary this
year's expense. Great care should
lie exercised by those who use the
tables now; and members of the
club, as having e property interest
in them, should see that they are
used only as they are meant to be.
The rule regarding the half-hour
limit of play should be more closely
adhered to, as instances are com
mon where a set of players "mon
opolize thinys" the entire even
ing. Also on account of the deple
tion of the club's available fund for
magazines and for the billiard
table, it is urged on all who can do
so to pay their assessments at once.
