Aijready we note tliiit tlie Asso
ciated Students of the University of
California have appointed the com
mittee which is to have control of
its debating interests for the year.
This committee consists of two
undergraduates and one graduate,
at present a member of the Hast
ings Law School, and arranges all
preliminary debates, and also acts
with a similar committee from Stan
ford in perfecting the details of the
Intercollegiate Debate. At Stanford
our system is more complex, and,
we fear, more cumbersome. Con
trol is divided between the Associ
ated Students and the Inter-Society
Debating League, which is a union
of all the literary societies. The
executive committee of the. League
is composed of three representatives
of each society, and has charge of
all preliminary debates and inter
society contests. Our intercollegiate
interests are exercised by a. com

mittee of three. Now that the liter
ary societies have organized, steps
should he taken to set this machin
ery in motion so that plane for a
vigorous campaign in debate may
he organized. All the societies
should elect their representatives,
so that work may he begun at once.
