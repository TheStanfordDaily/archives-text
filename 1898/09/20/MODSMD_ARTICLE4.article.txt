# Football Practice.
## 
### 
A large crowd on the bleachers
last evening encouraged thirty
seven candidates on the gridiron.
The practice was snappy, the men
this year appearing willing.
The freshmen showed up well in
signal practice. The indications
are for an exceptionally speedy
team. The line will be somewhat
heavier than was at first antici
pated.
Murphy's punts were for as great
a distance as usual. Burmister has
improved in kicking to a great ex
tent over last year. Not only are
his punts longer, but they are faster
in getting started.
Many new men were out, chief
among them being Meyer, a two
hundred pounder, who gives prom
ise of being a good man with the
proper coaching.
