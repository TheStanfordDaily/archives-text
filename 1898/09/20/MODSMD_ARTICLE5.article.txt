# '99 Class Meeting.

### 
The meeting of the '99 Class in
the chapel this afternoon, called for
the election of officers, provoked
more than ordinary interest he
cause of the contest over the adop
tion of the report of the auditing
committee appointed to investigate
the finances of the Annual.
The contest in the class election
resulted in the selection of the fol
lowing: President, Milnor Roberts;
vice-president, \V. C. Rogers; secre
tary, Miss Fowler; treasurer, R. E.
Filcher; football manager, F. S
Fisher; class council, O. C. Leiter,
Filcher, Leventritt, Russ, Arnold,
Whitaker, Miss Merritt.
The real contest of the afternoon
was over the adoption of the audit

ing committee's report, in which
a sum of money, amounting to
$55.00, was noted as a loan to the
'99 Annual, implying that that
sum was owing from the Annual
management to the class.
Manager Greenebaum of the An
nual stated that it was his under
standing that the $55.00 loaned by
the individual members was to the
class and not to the Annual. If
Mr. Greenebaum was correct, the
Annual had been published with
out a deficit, but had made some
$12.80.
After considerable discussion be
tween the members of the class, in
which McDowell, McKinnon, Grun
sky, Whitaker, Filcher, Schwartz,
Elias, and Manager Greenebaum
took part, the report of the audit
ing committee, holding the $55.00
still due the class from the Annual
management, was passed.
