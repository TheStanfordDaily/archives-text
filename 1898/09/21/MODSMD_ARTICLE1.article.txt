# MEMORIAL SERVICES.
## Professors and Students Pay Tribute to the Memory of Mrs. Barnes and Margaret M. Wickham. 
### 
Instead of the regular Tuesday
evening lecture last night, Stanford
faculty and students gathered in
the chapel to pay a last tribute to
two of its former teachers who died
during the vacation —Mary Sheldon
Barnes, who for six years was as
sistant professor in History, and
Margaret M. Wickham, for three
years assistant professor in the
German department.
The meeting opened with a violin
and organ adagio by Miss Winifred
Morgan and Mrs. E. D. Starbuck,
after which Dr. Jordan spoke a few
words in memory of those who
were gone. He concluded by read
ing a biographical sketch of Mrs.
Barnes written by her friend, Pro
fessor Griggs, who was with her
when the end came.
Mrs. Barnes loved Stanford.
Here she spent six of the happiest
and most useful years of her life.
At the time of her death she was
engaged, with her husband, in writ
ing a history of education, in re
viewing her "General History,"
and in writing a popular history
of the Pacific Coast.
After the reading of the resolu
tions drawn up by a committee of
the faculty in memory of Mrs.
Barnes, President Jordan spoke of
the earnest, scholarly work of Miss
Wickham and read the resolution
in her memory drawn up by the
faculty committee and the German
seminary.
Professor Goebel then spoke of
Miss Wickham as he had known
her in the relation of a colleague,
dwelling especially upon her ability
in arousing enthusiasm, the great
est gift a teacher can possess.
Professor Howard in talking of
Mrs. Barnes said: " She was a
woman of strong character: she had
traits of character both charming
and interesting to all who knew
her. There was no trace of cyni
cism in her character; hers was a
white soul. Especially did we ad
mire her simplicity of mind and
heart. She was original—a rare
trait among teachers. She was a
born teacher, a born leader of
young men and women."
Professor Cubberley in his re
marks said: "Just to meet her
was to know her. When a woman
of that kind lives it is a great gift
to the world; when she dies it is a
great loss." He also spoke of the
influence that her teaching had
had on the teaching of history all
over the State of California.
Professor Flugel sketched word
pictures of Mrs. Barnes which
brought her very vividly back to
our minds. In his language "si e
was a woman one always felt like
going to; one was always the better
for meeting her."
Miss Catherine Chandler, who
perhaps knew Mrs. Barnes better
than any other student here, spoke
of her home life, her effect upon
students, her utter unselfishness,
and concluded by reading parts of
her letters, in one of which, written
at the British Museum, she wrote:
"You can not imagine what a lovely
place this is, but every night I
think of Stanford and of Home."

The services closed with Miss
Morgan's singing "Over the Stars
There is Rest."
