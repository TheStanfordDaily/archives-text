A meeting of track men has been
called for tomorrow afternoon in
Encina gymnasium. The meeting
is primarily for the benefit of mem
bers of the Freshman Class and the
captain of the team wishes it to be
understood that all freshmen are
invited to go to the meeting whether
they intend to do anything on the
track or not. A good many men
from the new class have shown con
siderable eagerness to do fall train
ing, and some work will be done on
the track this semester. There is
danger that new men will do too
much, and it is to tell them what to
do that the meeting is called. The
principal object of fall training
must be the acquisition of " form "
and " style." The best men Stan
ford has had in different events
will be on hand to tell what'' form "
is in their events and how it is to
be attained. Several graduates who
have been prominent in track ath
letics will be on hand, and what
they say will be interesting to all
men interested in Stanford's track
team, whether they intend to be on
the team themselves or not. It is
very probable that some action will
be taken concerning the formation
of a cross-country club,as a good deal
of cross-country running will be
done by candidates for the team
this semester. Anybody interested
in this branch of the work should
come to the meeting, for, if there are
enough present, immediate steps to
ward organization may be taken.
