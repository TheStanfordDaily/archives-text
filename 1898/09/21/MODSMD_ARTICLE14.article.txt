In view of President Jordan's
known loyalty to Stanford it is no
surprise either to our University or
to the public to hear that he re
fuses to consider himself a candi
date for the presidency of Berkeley,
left open by the resignation of
President Kellogg. We quote the
following from the Call: "The place
has been offered to him, he will not
say by whom, but it is rumored
that it was at the instance of lie
gent Wallace, and there are many
regents who believe the Stanford
man could have the place did he
desire it. Dr. Jordan denies that
he applied for the place or that he
wants it. 'There has been no of
ficial suggestion of any kind,' he
said on being questioned, 'it was
simply a tentative talk. I appre
ciate the importance of the posi
tion, but I prefer the one I now
hold to any other that is possible.
The best work that is possible
can be done right here. Last year
1 declined to receive the position
that I thought the most attractive
in this country, the directorship of
the National Museum. That declina
tion emphasized my determination
to stay with Stanford University as
long as I was worth anything to
the institution. We have had a
hard struggle here, but now that
the struggle is about over, it em
phasizes the idea of my staying.
We are now through our serious
difficulties.' "
