We, the Faculty of the Leland
Stanford Junior University, realize
that in the death of Margaret E.
Wickham we have lost one in whom
were combined with superior men
tal abilities Christian virtues of a
positive and noble type, and one
whose life and example were an in
spiration to all who came within
her influence. We desire, there
fore, to embody in this memorial
our sorrow for her loss and our re
spect for her memory.

We, of the Leland Stanford Jun
ior University, who have been
among the friends and co-workers
of Mary Sheldon Barnes, have re
ceived with deep regret the news of
her death. We know the scope of
her labors, which have contributed
so measurably to the better educa
tion of the present generation of
Americans. We were permitted to
see something of the heroism of her
life, struggling through weakness
and pain to the ends of a noble
ambition. And we knew the Chris
tian simplicity of her character,
her modest bearing, her cheerful
helpfulness, her unfailing kindness
and love. Mindful of these things,
and recognizing the value of her
presence and services among us for
six years, we are moved to this ex
pression of our sorrow and our
sense of loss, and we desire to re
cord this resolution of endearing re
spect for her memory.
