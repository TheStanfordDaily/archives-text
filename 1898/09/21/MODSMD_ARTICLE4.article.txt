# FOOTBALL MEN LINE UP.
## For the First Time This Year Varsity Has a Try-out Against Freshmen and Second Team. 
### 
Football men are beginning to
get out regularly, and by another
week the season will be well under
way. Yesterday afternoon Husk
was out for the first time. Fickert
was on the field assisting Captain
Fisher in the coaching.
The first line-up of the season
occurred yesterday afternoon. The
freshman team lined up for a few
minutes against the first eleven.
The first-year men made a showing
that was a surprise to most of the
spectators, holding their heavier
opponents and even making occas
ional gain. Hice made a good run
and tackled hard.
The first team then lined up
against another eleven chosen from
the remaining candidates. The
few minutes of play were very one
sided, the first eleven being able to
advance the ball in every scrim
mage. Large gains were made by
Dole, Smith, and Fisher. Parker
made the prettiest end run of the
day.
The men have better wind than
is to be expected at this time of the
year, and were able to play fifteen
minutes on a dusty field without,
any signs of distress. The teams
will line up every evening from
now on, so as to be in shape when
Coach Cross arrives.
