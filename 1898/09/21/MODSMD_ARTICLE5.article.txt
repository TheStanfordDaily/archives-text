Editor Daily Palo Alto.
Dear Sir: â€”Permit a tired wheel
man to call attention to the de
plorable, nay well nigh execrable
condition of our University bicycle
path. Surely those who have au
thority need only to ride over the
path once to be thoroughly con
vinced that some steps should be
taken at once to lessen the wear
and tear on wheels and riders.
Excepting the cinder-path, sa
cred to pedestrians, there is not
fifty yards of decent wheel path
between Palo Alto and the quad.
The writer would gladly make one
of a student body road-repairing
corps, could such be recruited some
Saturday. Or, which would be far
simpler and require less outlay, let
the wheelmen and pedestrians be
allowed to trade paths. By this
arrangement the latter class would
gain a more solid path than the
cinders afford, while wheelmen
would find the change equally sat
isfactory. T. W.
