# Cadwallader at Berkeley.
## 
### 
The following dispatch relative to
Cadwallader, the big freshman who
played center rush at Yale last
year, and who is now at Berkeley,
will be of interest to Stanford stu

dents. It appears in the Call under
date of Sept. 16:
" Cadwallader has entered the
University of California at Berke
ley, Cal. His loss to the Yale
eleven will be irreparable. He was
not only a clever center rush, but
his stature and strength made him
almost impregnable in line.
" The reason for Cadwallader's not
returning to Yale is that he failed to
maintain an average of over 2.25 in
his studies, and the faculty refused
to allow him to return to college if
he played football. Rather than
give up football he decided to go to
another college where faculty rules
are not so severe. Football men at
Yale are greatly disturbed at the
loss of Cadwallader and at present
do not expect to be able to replace
him."
