A glancio at the summaries fol
lowing the list of new students in
the present issue will reveal several
significant facts. The number of
graduate students and advanced
students is exactly the same as last
year. Last year there were 258
matriculates of whom 117 were
specials. This year there are 227
matriculates of whom 54 are
specials. This means that 178 regu
lar students entered this fall, where
as only 141 regulars entered last
year.
Considerable comment has been
made this year regarding the small
ness of the freshman class. An
analysis of the summaries, however,
reveals the fact that there are thirty
more regular new students this year
than last. No clearer proof need be
adduced that the general falling off
this year is due to the more strin
gent rules which have been enforced
for the first time in the case of
special students.
