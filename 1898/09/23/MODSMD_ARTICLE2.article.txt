Editor Daily Palo Alto: —Kind-
ly permit, a word of suggestion about
Stanford enthusiasm. Is it not
time that the splendid enthusiasm

which pervades tlie student body
with regard to our football pros
pects should have an organized ex
pression? It is evident to all that
although our football chances are
not so good as previously, there
nevertheless exists a line spirit of
cheerfulness and a determination
to win It is also evident to an
old student that our yelling is on
the decline. It was painful the
other afternoon to see a few half
hearted efforts to cheer the players,
and only two attempts to give the
old yell. Let us have some ener
getic, enthusiastic, and enthusiasm
inspiring yell leaders and the team
will play better football.
Yours for the cause,
Post Gkad.
