# Track Work Begins.
## 
### 
At the call of Captain Smith
nearly fifty candidates for this
year's track team assembled in
Encina gymnasium yesterday after
noon.
After the captain had outlined
the policy of this year's training
I). E. Brown, '97, addressed the
men. He approved of fall train
ing and advised the men to train
steadily with especial attention to
form. He urged each man to study
himself, discover his own needs,
and develop his own style. He re
commended the idea of gymnasium
work in connection with outdoor
training.
Dr. Angell said that what is
needed is steady work on the part of
the men training, and sympathetic
support from the University at
large.
Charlie Dole thinks the prospects
this year are encouraging. He sug
gests next spring's success on the
track will depend more on the con
scientious efforts of new men than
upon the work of our " stars" of
the past.
Training on the track will begin
at once.
