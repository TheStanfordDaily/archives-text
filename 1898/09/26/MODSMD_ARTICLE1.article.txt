## Work on the Library and Assembly Hall Buildings Progressing. 
### 
Work on the new library and as
sembly hall is progressing satisfac
torily to those in charge, and if the
coming winter season is not too
severe the former will be completed
before the opening of the next col
lege year and the latter in time for
use next commencement.
Architecturally both buildings
will be in keeping with the other
buildings of the quadrangle. They
are united in one structure, though
there will be no inner connection
between them. The library will be
known as the "Thomas Welton
Stanford Library" in honor of Sen
ator Stanford's brother, who resides
in Australia and who has always
shown a deep interest in the growth
and welfare of the institution.
This structure is the first building
of the outer quadrangle and will be
two stories in height. It is 265 by
151 feet, and will be absolutely lire
proof, constructed on the Ransome
method of twisted steel and con
crete.
Along the outer side of the new
buildings and connecting them
with the present quadrangle will
be arcades twenty feet wide in front
of the library and eighteen feet
wide in front of the assembly hall.
The arches of the arcades will be
live in number, of spans of twenty
four feet live inches in the former
case, and eight of twelve-foot span
in the latter.
The library will be entered by
two main doors in the front of the
building opening directly into the
main room where study tables
will be located. The main room
will be 09x70 feet and will be lighted
by a dome forty feet in diameter
set with amber colored glass.
Around this room there will be a
balcony eight feet wide which is
reached by two flights of marble
stairs. From this balcony doors
open into the seven rooms ol the
second floor —two on each side and
three over the arcade—which will
be special department-rooms. There
are also two of these rooms on the
east and west sides of the main
room down stairs. South of the
reading-room is located the stack
room which will be litted with
triple decked book cases of a total
shelving capacity of 75,000 volumes.
This stack room is separated from
the reading room by three large
open arches supported by marble
pillars, and on each side are two
smaller arches.
The walls of the main part of
the first floor are wainscoted with
five feet of marble based with eight
inches of marble of a different
color. On the balcony, which will
have a copper railing, there will be
pedestals at intervals of twenty
feet for statues, and the floor will
be of concrete and self supporting.
The special department-rooms will
have shelves for 25,000 volumes,
making the total capacity of the
library 200,000 volumes.
The assembly hall will comfort
ably seat 1500 people, although
more will be able to find accommo
dation. It also will have a dome
of amber colored glass. The floor
of the auditorium will have a grad
ual incline towards the stage of

two and one-half per cent, while in
the gallery the seats will tie placed
on steps. The stage will be 36x86
feet, and when necessary will seat
250 people. There will be two
green rooms on each side of the
stage.
The interior of the assembly hall
will be finished in trimmings of
yellow pine, and it is the intention
to have opera chairs for seats.
