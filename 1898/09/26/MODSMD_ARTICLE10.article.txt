It is pleasant to note the enthus
iasm with which the students in
Enema Hall are practicing the col
lege football songs this early in the
season and we can not forbear the
suggestion that a like spirit be
shown by the young ladies of
Hoble and by all others where they
are assembled in suflicient num
bers to make it possible. No one
will deny that to this method of
giving vent to our love for 'Stan
ford and football is due a large
proportion of that intangible Home
thing we call Stanford spirit.
In former years the singing of
gridiron airs at football rallies and
other fall gatherings of students
was an important feature of the oc
casions, but of late there has been a!
tendency to not utilize this force to J
the fullest advantage. Undoubt
edly one reason for this is the fact
that the students have not known
the songs, and this in turn was
undoubtedly the result of not mak
ing them available a long enough
time before they were needed. We
certainly must do everything pos
sible to encourage and continue a
practice which has yielded us such
good results, and to that end we
would suggest that the Executive
Committee of the Student Body
call immediately for the submis
sion of new songs by the students,
and that judges be appointed and
the collection selected as soon
thereafter as possible so that no
student will have a valid excuse for
not swelling the thrilling chorus
that will help our football men win
another victory.
