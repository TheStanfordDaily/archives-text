A good showing was made on the
gridiron Friday afternoon in point
of numbers, and snappy work
marked the practice throughout.
For the Varsity, Dole, Fisher, and
Burmister covered the most ground.
McFadden and Strout played the
best game for the second team.
Daggett made several good tackles.
For the most part the men are in
poor form as regards handling the
ball. Easy punts are badly muffed
very frequently, the average player
being able to hold but about one
out of three kicks.
The line-up was as follows :
VARSITY SECOND
Smith 1 end r Daggett
Gray 1 tackle r Bidwell
Cairns 1 guard r. . Mackinnon
liiglow center E. Oilman
Blanchard.r guard 1 Brown
Faris r tackle 1 Chandler
Parker rend 1 McFadden
Murphy.... quarter Beckley
Dole 1 half r ... . R. Gil man
Kisher r half 1 Strout
Burmister. ..fullback Parkin
Arrangements have been made
for a game Wednesday between the
Freshman and Belmontteams. This
will be the first opportunity to see
the first-year men in a game. Bel
mont has a particularly strong team
this season which is in somewhat
better shape than that of the fresh
men, having been longer at practice.
This advantage will be offset, in
part, by the difference in weight.
An exceedingly close, fast, game
may be looked for. Play will be
called at 3:15 sharp.
The candidates for the Freshman
team met Friday evening in room
10 quad. After considerable discus
sion it was deemed advisable to
postpone the election of captain.
A motion was carried to the effect
that Temporary Captain Geissler
continue to act until next Saturday
evening, when an election will be
held.
