# MORE NEWS FROM MANILA.
## Another Letter from Dillon at Camp Dewey about Stanford Men. 
### 
After our long tedious trip of
thirty-seven days was ended, we
entered Manila bay amid the firing
of salutes and cheers from the men
of the American navy. We landed
the day after our arrival at Cavite
arsenal and navy yard eight miles
across the bay from Manila, and
thirty-five around the bay by land.
Our regiment, the 2nd Oregon,
was the only one left at Cavite, the
others having been landed at
" Camp Dewey" across the bay.
Those at Camp Dewey had sev
eral skirmishes during their stay
there and while awaiting the bom
bardment of Manila. A few men
were killed and more wounded, but
the number killed on the other side
more than avenged ours, and while
we mourned those who died for our
cause we feel satisfied that they,
had they lived, would have been
willing to do more if possible for
the cause.
On account of having been left
at Cavite we were mightily afraid
that we were going to be overlooked
as far as the taking of Manila was
concerned, but we of " Stanford"
felt that our " Stanford luck" had
never deserted us, and the evening
before the bombardment we were
ordered to hold ourselves in readi
ness to move.
Next morning we were marched
aboard a Hong Kong steamer, the
'' Kwong Hoi," and pulled out into
the bay in the rear of General Mer
ritt's boat, the " Zaziro."
We lay alongside the latter boat
during the bombardment, and had
a tine view of it. It was merely a
farce, although 1 suppose the 'Frisco
papers made it out a big thing.
Rumors were about, three weeks
before, that Manila was willing to
surrender, but would have to make
a small resistance for show. So
Dewey placed bis shots where they
wouldn't do much harm, and the
troops on shore fired so they
wouldn't harm any one, and then
the white llag was run up in Ma
nila. \\ r e were ordered to land on
the north end of the city, while the
troops from Camp Dewey marched
in from the south end. We reached
the walled city first and raised the
first American flag, which, upon its
ascension, was greeted by the fleet.
All that day and night we were
on duty at the palace, General
Merritt's headquarters, receiving
arms and ammunition from Span
ish soldiers. While some protested
against laying down their arms, the
majority were glad tlint all was
over.
We have been given the honor of
being General Merritt's body guard.
That and the fact of our having
raised the first flag make us feel
very proud.
After our landing at Cavite, Sec
ond Lieutenant E. J. Bryan, Stan
ford '9(>, was chosen by General
Anderson to do spy duty and draw
maps of the fortifications of Manila.
He had many narrow escapes while
engaged in that dangerous work,
and often had to swear that he was
an Englishman in order to save his
neck. He is now doing special
work for General Merritt.

Dolph, ex-'Ol, has had his name
sent to Washington for promotion
on account of meritorious work in
caring for the wounded in time of
action. He is now in chief operat
ing room in the Division Hospital.
Yours truly is still issuing rations
to the regiment with not many
prospects except plenty to eat.
All the boys join me in best
wishes. Yours truly,
Chas. I. Dillon.
