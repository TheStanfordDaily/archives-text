At their lirst game, to be played
tomorrow, the freshman rooters
want to be as much in evidence as
their team. They should ;ill be
together on the grandstand and
have leaders to lead their yelling.
Every member of the Class of '02
should turn out to see the game.
This is your lirst appearance, as a
class, before your college, and you
will be judged by the showing you
make. Be sure you do yourselves
credit.
