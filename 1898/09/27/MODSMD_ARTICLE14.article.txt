Track Manager Culver had t he
track harrowed yesterday after the
rain and today has had men at
work preparing it for fall training.
The track as it is at present has
too many cinders an 1 should have
more clay worked into il. This
would prevent it from drying out
so rapidly as it does now after each
time it is watered. Last year the
track was unfit for use a large part
of the time because it was impos
sible with the money at the man
ager's disposal to water it frequent
ly enough. Working clay into it
now while it is softened by rain
would save money next semester.
On the other hand if the location
of track is to be changed, the man
ager does not want to waste any
money on the present' track but
the new one should be commenced
as soon as possible. It is to be
hoped that a decision will be
reached immediately concerning
the permanent location of the
track.
