# BELMONT-FRESHMEN.
## First Game of the Season Held on the Campus Tomorrow. 
### 
The Freshman team will play its
first game tomorrow with Belmont
on the campus. An exceedingly
close score will be the result. The
members of the Belmont team have
been in constant practice since the
middle of August and are in excel
lent shape. Though not so heavy
as the '02 men they will have bet
ter team work. The Belmont team
is a favorite at Stanford. In every
game with the Freshmen of past
years Belmont has given a good
account of herself, winning from
'00 and being defeated by a score
of 4 to 0 by '01.
The Freshmen will be out in
force tomorrow, giving their newly
adopted yell. The game will start
at 8:15 sharp. An admission fee of
ten cents will be charged.

Rice, 1 e; Gage, 1 t; Cairns, 1 g;
Anderson, r g; Webber, r t; Sell,
r e; Cooper, quarter; Hough, 1 h;
