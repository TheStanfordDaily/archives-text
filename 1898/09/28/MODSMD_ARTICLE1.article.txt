After the game Coach Taylor of
Belmont said: "1 think that indi
vidually the Freshmen are superior
to Belmont. The kicking on both
sides was slow and there was not
that quality of team work that will
be displayed later in the season.
Kor Stanford Rice and Beedy
played the best games. Geissler
made many gains, and Sefton and
Story played the best for Belmont."
