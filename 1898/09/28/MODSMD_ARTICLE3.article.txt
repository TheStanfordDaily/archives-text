# "THE ENCHANTED MESA."
## President Jordan Gives an Interesting Description of His Recent Ascent. 
### 
One of the strangest regions of
the world, one that is haunted with
all manner of strange ideas, is New
Mexico. The lecture last night by
Dr. Jordan was a recital of three of
these queer traditions. The first
was concerning the Enchanted
Mesa, which was visited this sum
mer by Dr. and Mrs. Jordan, Mil
no r Roberts, 'yy, Charles F. Lum
mis and his six-year old daughter,
and Theodore Hittel.
About the year 1200 New Mex
ico was for the most part inhabited
by two general tribes: farmers, who
raised purple corn in the valleys
and had their homes in high
places, and hunters, the ancestors
of the Navajos, Pawnees, and other
tribes, who did nothing but hunt
and steal. These people built their
houses 011 inaccessible cliffs, climb
ing up to the top by means of lad
ders, and then down into the rooms
on the first and second floors.
Katzimo, or the Enchanted Mesa
(mesa being Spanish for table), is
a rock that was once used for this
purpose. It is of soft, red sand
stone, brick color, 431 feet high,
with perpendicular sides, and hav
ing an area on top of some forty
acres.
The ascent was made by means
of a narrow crack, toe-lioles having
been cut in the side of the walls.
Some 600 years ago a heavy storm
rent the cliff and made the crack
so wide that those who were down
in the valley could not get up
again, and those who were on top,
tradition says three old women,
could not get down. This storm
was supposed to have been caused
by some demon, and 110 one could
ever climb the cliff again, so the
Indians moved to another mesa
three miles off which they called
Acoma.
The second legend is that in 1540
there was a tradition in the south
ern part of New Mexico that there
were seven rich cities to the north
which were more wonderful than
the city of the Montezutnas.
A Catholic priest and negro ser
vant were the first to start out to
find these cities. They came to a
stone city, but were prevented from
entering it, because the people threw
stones at them. Later the Gover
nor of Mexico sent a great soldier,
Coronado, with 200 men to explore
the same region. They, too, were
received with arrows and stones.
In time, however, the Indians went
away, but 110 gold was found.
The Spaniards afterwards met an
old Pawnee Indian who told ma rvel
lous stories of a city called Quivira,
where there were golden houses,
and where the king had a golden
boat, where golden bells hung in
the trees and made sweet music
when the wind blew. The Indians
had probably taken this fellow
prisoner, and had promised him
his freedom if he would lead the
Spaniards away and lose them in
the desert. He led them to a vil
lage somewhere between Kansas
City and Lincoln, Neb., where there
were only huts made of poles and
skins. Coronado then cut off the
Indian's head, abandoned the

search, and returned home. The
Quivira never existed except in
story.
The third legend is concerning
Acoma, a town found by Coron
ado's men. In the church of Ac
oma there is a painting of San
Jose which was once borrowed by
the people of Laguna, in order that
they might have prosperity. The
people of Laguna afterwards refused
to give it back, and the case was
finally decided in court.
All around Acoma are pinnacles
of every description, and holes and
caverns, tilled with ghosts and spir
its. It is also the region of snake
dances and many other curious
mysteries more or less understand
able.
Not far away is San Mateo, the
highest mountain in New Mexico,
which is the home of a set of people
known as the ''Penitent Brothers.''
They k take the long spined cactuses,
pile them up on their backs, then
put a heavy stone on top of them,
so that the spines will be driven
into the very marrow. Once a year,
up to 18U1, they nailed some one of
their band to a cross, and then
planted the cross up-side-down.
The more pain they suffer, the hap
pier they are. Any one telling the
secrets of the order is buried alive.
After relating these tales from the
land of sunshine and silence ; the
rest of the evening was spent in ex
plaining and talking about the
various stereopticon views of the
region from whence come these
legends.
