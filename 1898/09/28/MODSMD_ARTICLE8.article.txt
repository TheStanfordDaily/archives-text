According to one of the morning
papers, there in the possibility that
an Eastern eleven may be been on
a Coast gridiron this fall. No one
could be more anxious to see such
an event than we at Stanford.
Never since our games with Chi
cago ;it Christmas, 1895, have we
had the opportunity of lining up
against representatives of the East
ern football world. And though
the loss of our great center trio of
last year would be severely felt, es
pecially in such a game, yet we
sincerely hope that such a contest
may take place.
In former years the Women's
Athleiic Association has had its
usefulness for the year greatly les
sened by its failure to organize
promptly in the fall. This year
the election of oflicers takes place
on Monday and Tuesday, October
8 and 4, two weeks earlier than
last year. It is to be hoped
that all members, old and new,
will pay their dues promptly and
vote, and that the officers as soon
as elected will see that the pleas
ant weather of early fall is utilized
for outdoor sports of all kinds.
The importance of this, the only
athletic organization for women
here, is emphasized by the fact, as
stated in another column, that 45.5
per cent, or nearly half of our en
tering students this year are
women.
