## Boys from the Bunch-Grass State Defeated in Football— Score 22 to 0. 
### 
The Varsity defeated the Wash
ington Volunteers this afternoon in
the first practice game of the sea
son by a score of 22 to 0. The
game was interesting as affording a
standard of comparing Varsity can
didates, but was a loose exhibition
of football. A fairly large and en
thusiastic crowd witnessed the
game.
In the first half Captain Fisher
and the old Varsity men formed
the nucleus of the team, which se
cured three touchdowns in fifteen
minutes without any difficulty
whatever. The encouraging feat
ures of the lirst halt were tne stiff
ness of the line, the line-bucking of
Jiurmister, and five-yard plunges
through the line, Fisher's interfer
ence, Dole's twenty-yard run, Mur
phy's punting, and Parker's tack
ling and end runs. Washington
had a strong center trio, and our
men stood up well against them.
In the second half the whole
line-up was changed for Stanford.
McFadden's work at half was ex
cellent, both in tackling and offen
sive work. Beckett and Faris
played good defensive games. Hill
made good gains on his line-bucks.
There was, however, no team work
and no ability to advance iJie ball
where gains were needed. No one
soldiered but a halfback on the
Washington team.

downing Dole on his long runs, be
sides scoring the only long run for
his team. Most of Washington's
gains were made on line-bucks by
Fullback McDougall. The work of
Kohl at center was excellent.

Cross said: "I am very much
pleased with the showing made this
afternoon. There seems to be
plenty of material, which is en
couraging. 1 notice several prom
ising men who were not out when I

together I am very hopeful. The
center is of course weak and will
have to be built up. Tomorrow we
