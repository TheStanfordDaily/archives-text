At the meeting of the executive
committee of the Inter Society De
bating League Monday the ques
tion of providing for the system of
finals and semi-finals in the pre
liminary debates for choosing rep
resentatives for the Carnot and
Intercollegiate contests will be dis
cussed. Our present system of
choosing speakers does not give us
our best men as representatives,
and the Daily I'alo Alto believes
that if the plan of semi-finals as
well as final preliminaries were
instituted, with exemptions for
those who have made either of the
intercollegiate teams, a system
more satisfactory than the present
might be evolved.
