Now that Coach Cross lias ar
rived to take in hand our football
affairs and develop for us another
victorious eleven, it is time that
the Stanford spirit and enthusiasm
which has always been such a fac
tor in surmounting difficulties and
in meeting emergencies should
manifest itself in a degree before
unknown. The Stanford spirit
tiiis year should have no bounds.
We have a coach whom we trust
for his ability, loyalty, and enthus
iasm. Our captain has proved his
great worth time and again. The
football men are as steady as they
ever were. Mr. Cross will always
be known in Stanford football his
tory as the ''20-o'' coach. It was
he who developed our impregnable
line and made the big score pos
sible. Besides teaching the men
the game, Coach Cross has shown
his power to imbue the football
men with that spirit that knows
not the word "quit."
