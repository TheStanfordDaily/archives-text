Now that the Junior Class has
definitely decided to revive the cus
tom of wearing plugs it will be in
teresting to note the success with
which they carry out their plan.
To adopt the plugs and to purchase
them is indeed an easy matter, but
the real problem comes in wearing
them. Introducing and parading
them fora few days is no more than
many other classes have done be
fore. If the present Junior Class
wishes to do something that no
other Stanford class has accom
plished and which will denote a de
termination to act and not merely
to talk, they will comply with the
resolutions passed at one of their
recent meetings, and will wear them
throughout the year.
