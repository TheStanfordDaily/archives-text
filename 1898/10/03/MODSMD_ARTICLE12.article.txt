Very essential to our success in
our two debating contests with
Berkeley this year is the adoption
of improved methods of managing
the preliminaries for both. The
plan now under consideration by
the executive committee of the Jn
tersociety Debating League has
many good features. It is given in
full in another column that it may
be more widely discussed before

the committee takes its final stand
on Wednesday.
There lias been a tendency at
Stanford to underrate the import- J
ance of the Carnot debate. The j
originators of the present plan of
finals and semi-finals hope by ex
empting previous Carnot and In
tercollegiate debaters from the semi
finals of both to overcome this feel
ing, which they consider unwar- J
ranted and deplorable. The few
opponents of the plan as it now
stands claim that such exemption
will bring so many speakers into
the finals as to make that one night
a burden to judges and audience.
It seems hard to combine all desir
able features into one plan. Let
this plan be thoroughly discussed,
however, and let us make one as
nearly perfect as possible.
