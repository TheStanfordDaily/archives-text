### 
The class in Economics 14, under
Professor Fetter, visited the insane
asylum at Agnews and the county
almshouse at Mil pitas last Satur
day.
After examining the entire plant
and buildings at Agnews under the
guidance of Dr. Sponagle, the class
drove to the almshouse, some six
miles distant, where it was enter
tained at a bountiful lunch by Mr.
Walcutt, superintendent of the in
stitution, after which the different
buildings were inspected and the
methods of operation noted. About
thirty-nine persons composed the
party.
The members of the class felt ex
tremely grateful toward both Dr.
Sponagle and Mr. Walcott for the
generous treatment and hospitable
manner in which they were re
ceived.
