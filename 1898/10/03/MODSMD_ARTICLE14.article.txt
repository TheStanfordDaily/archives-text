### 
Walter G. Nagel, '90, died in the
division hospital at Camp Cuba
Libre, Jacksonville, Florida, August
19, 1898. He entered Stanford from
Davonport, lowa, in the fall of 1892,
taking history as his major subject.
The purpose of entering the field of
journalism took shape with him
while yet in college, and in his
studies he kept this aim before him
and went home well fitted for the
work. He was on the local staff of
the Democrat, of Davenport, and
acted fora time as city editor of
the Republican of that place. When
the war broke out, in answer to the
first call for volunteers, he joined
Company B, Ist Regiment lowa
Volunteers. During the latter part
of July he was taken with typhoid
fever,which proved fatal three weeks
later. We quote the following from
the Democrat:
'• All the best part of his life was
before him. Years of preparation
were just beginning to bear fruit.
He laid it all on his country's altar,
and none who went down before
Spanish bullets in actual battle de
serve more truly the tears and
praise of a grateful people."
