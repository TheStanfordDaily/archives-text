# TAX ON UNIVERSITY PROPERTY
## Facts Concerning It and the Plans of the Alumni Association to Secure Relief From It. 
### 
The executive committee of the
Alumni Association, feeling that it
is time that every friend of the
University should know of the facts
and present status of the taxation
question so that .their efforts may
be directed during the coining cam
paign toward securing for the Uni
versity relief from tins burden so
unwisely put upon it, asked the
editor of the Daily Palo Alto tor
space in the columns of the paper
to present the matter. The request
Was granted, and the following
statement is an effort to give the
information suggested.
In the first place it may be well
to state that the property origin
ally given to the University by
Senator and Mrs. Stanford consisted
of the Palo Alto ranch, situa ed
partly in JSanla Clara and partly
111 San Mateo county, containing
about eight thousand acres; the
Gridley farm, situated in Butte
county, containing about twenty
two thousand acres; and the Vina
farm, situated partly in Butte and
partly in Tehama county, contain
ing about lifty-tive thousand acres.
These aggregate something over
eighty-five thousand acres. From
time to time additions have been
made to this endowment. The
University buildings have been
erected; Mrs. Stanford's residences
in San Francisco and at the Uni
versity have been conveyed to the
University; and largest of all was
the bequest of two and one-half
million dollars in mortgage bonds
which Senator Stanford made to
the University by his will. The
net annual income from this prop
erty at present is about one hun
dred and eighty thousand dollars.
This lacks a large amount of being
suflicient to pay the running ex
penses of the University with the
present number of students and
consequent demands, the deficit
is made up through personal self
sacrifice, the details of which need
not be discussed here. Everyone
will appreciate the importance of
the taxation question when it is
said that nearly one fourth of the
total annual receipts from Univer
sity property goes for taxes each
year. It is to relieve the Univer
sity of this destructive drain on its
resources that the alumni feel some
thing should be done.
Next, perhaps, a few words as to
the actual state of the law may
clear matters. The present consti
tution, adopted in 1879, provides
that all property in the State shall
be taxed in proportion to its value
except (1) property exempt under
laws of the United States; (2) prop
erty belonging to the United States,
to this Stale, or to any county or
municipal corporation within this
State; (3) property used exclusively
for public schools; and (4) growing
crops. (Art. XIII, sec. 1.) The
constitution further provides that
the legislature shall not pass local
or special laws for (among other
purposes) the assessment or collec
tion of taxes or exempting property
from taxation (Art. IV, sec. 25.)
Since the constitution was adopted
amendments have been adopted by

the people exempting fruit- and
nut-bearing trees and grape-vines
fora certain period after the}' are
planted, and exempting free public
libraries and free museums. Leav
ing out of consideration the exemp
tion of growing crops, fruit- and
nut-bearing trees, grape-vines, and
property owned by some division of
the government, or exempt under
United States laws, which does not
affect the question of our taxation
in any way, we can sum up the
present State law in a very few
words: all property is taxed except
that used exclusively for public
schools and for free public libraries
and free museums. It might be
suggested that under that law the
University property is exempt on
the ground that the University is
a free public school. But this,
perhaps, can not be maintained.
By article IX, section 6, of the con
stitution it is declared that "the
public school system shall include
primary and grammar schools and
such high schools, evening schools,
normal schools, and technical
schools as may be established by the
legislature or by municipal or dis
trict authoritylt may be claimed
that Stanford University, while it
was established by powers granted
by the legislature, was not estab
lished by the legislature nor by mu
nicipal or district authority, and so
does not come within the meaning
of the term "public schools." How
ever that may be, it is clearly in
spirit and in its practical effect a
public school. It was established
under power given by the legisla
ture enabling such institutions to
be created; the act giving this power
is an act, by its title, "to promote
the public welfare" ; the board of
trustees, by the terms of the endow
ment, must annually report all
their doings to the person who is at
the time governor of the State;
there is no tuition charged, instruc
tion is free to all. But while this
is an argument for giving it the
same exemption that public schools
enjoy, it is not clear that it brings
it within the term "public school''
so as to make it exempt at present.
The fact at all events is that under
the present law the University
property is taxed.
What has been done in the past
to bring about the needed reform?
At the last session of the legisla
ture Mr. Malcolm, assemblyman
from this district, introduced a bill
to exempt the University property.
This bill failed to pass for several
reasons not necessary to discuss
here, the chief of which was doubt
by its own friends as to its consti
tutionality. The discussion made
it evident that, considering article
IV, section 25, mentioned above,
the only certain relief must come
through a change in the state con
stitution.
It may be stated here, however,
that a bill was passed and approved
exempting the University with
other like charitable, benevolent,
social, religious, educational, or
public institutions (pecuniary pro
fit not being their object) from the
live per cent, collateral it heritance
tax which is imposed by the State
on property descending to any per
son or corporation except certain
near relatives. This has already

saved the University one hundred
and twenty-live thousand dollars
which would have gone in payment
of the tax on property willed to the
University by Senator Stanford
and may save it much more in
property willed to the University
by others in the future.
Today, then, the problem is to so
change the constitution as to ex
empt the University property, and
perhaps the property of similar in
stitutions doing public service on a
private foundation, from taxation.
The alumni of the University
have felt for some time that it now
behooves them to step in and by
their influence and persistent en
deavor, profiting by the experience
of the past, to try to bring about
the desired result. In accordance
with that idea the San Francisco
Alumni Association, early last
spring, appointed a committee, con
sisting of Messrs. Crothers, Brown,
and Sheehan, to devise plans and
go to work. This committee has
done much to bring the matter to
the attention of the alumni gener
ally. In furtherance of the same
movement the main Alumni Asso
ciation, at its annual meeting last
Commencement, passed resolutions
calling attention to the problems to
be solved and urging action by
alumni, ex-students, and friends of
the University having for its object
the securing of a legislature which
will favor and vote for whatever
plan of exemption seems best for
the University. In particular it is
urged in the resolutions that every
one vote in favor of calling the
constitutional convention to draft
a new constitution for the State.
By a joint resolution of -the last
Senate and Assembly the people
will vote on that question this fall.
In the first place we all know that
the constitution is very defective
and needs adaptation to present
conditions. In the second place in
a constitutional convention the
amendment we desire would receive
the careful consideration it deserves
and it is probable that the enlight
ened members of the convention
would see that California follows
the example of the other great
States. There are live States (Idaho,
Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and
Wyoming) where no universities
except State institutions (which
are of course exempt) exist and
where therefore the need of such
exemption has not been felt. Stan
ford alone of all the universities of
the world has been compelled to
pay taxes.
These resolutions together with
some further explanation of the
questions involved are now being
printed and will be sent all over
the State to alumni, ex-students,
and friends of the University. It
is hoped that this will accomplish
much. It is also important that
students of the University should
lie informed on this matter and
should each and every one take an
active interest. It is only by con
centrated effort that we can hope
to be of influence, and the task of
each one is comparatively small in
comparison with the benefits we
have all derived from our Alma
Mater. Let us all take a hand. It
is in the hope that a full knowl
edge of the facts and of the import

anee of the question may lead to
an active interest by all in a dis
cussion of methods of making that
influence felt, and in some form of
united effort to accomplish the end
in view, that this article is pub
lished.
