# Cross Enlivens the Practice.
## 
### 
Coach Cross made his presence
felt by the men on the Varsity field
last evening and the play was par
ticularly snappy, the Varsity mak
ing gains at almost every down.
The second also put up a good
game, stopping center plays and
advancing the ball in Varsity ter
ritory. Coach Cross came to the
Varsity's rescue when a second
eleven man was scudding down the
Held by making a sensational tackle,
bringing the man down in line style
and winning the applause of the
bleachers.
The center men received most of
the coach's attention, particularly
Blanchard and Biglow. The for
mation for interference and for
kick-offs was also criticised. The
chief gains for the Varsity were
made by Dole, Fisher, and Parker.
Burmister is improving daily in his
line-bucking, reminding one at
times of the days Cotton used to
advance the ball with a whole team
on his shoulders.
The line-up was as follows:
