In this issue appears an account
of the movement that was started
some time ago fort-he purpose of
freeing Stanford of the burden in
taxes which she is compelled to
pay to the State. The statement
was prepared l>y the Alumni Asso
ciation, and contains the facts and
present status of the movement. It
is in such a form that every student
can know just what has been done,
and what remains to be accom
plished. Kvery student owes it to
his Alma Mater to thoroughly un
derstand this question, which is of
such vital importance to her wel
fare and future prosperity. When
the students are called upon to do
their part toward the accomplish
ment of the purpose of the alumni
a knowledge of the question and an
understanding of what has been
done are essential if their efforts are
to be effective. The issue presented
is certainly the one above all others
in this campaign as far as the stu
dents of Inland Stanford Junior
University are concerned. Its full
significance can not be realized too
soon by the students. The mem
bers of the Alumni Association who
are giving their time and their
energy to accomplish justice for
their Alma Mater need the co-oper
ation of the student body. A plan
will soon be worked out by which
every alumnus, every student, and
every friend of the University can
do something to relieve Stanford of
the unjust tax imposed by the Stale.
Nothing can be more reasonable
than our request. In taxing us
one fourth of our income to fit
her children for good citizenship,
the State is absurdly unjust. She
is also unwise, for her action in this
respect will have a tendency to dis
courage other institutions of learn
ing from coining within our bord
ers. Institutions now here may be
compelled to leave the State if the
constitution is not so amended that
the tax shall cease. The fight that

tin; alumni and the students must
enter on will be a hard one. To
win, nothing can he left undone.
No student can afford to remain
passive and inactive. Try to devise
means by which the object in view
can be attained. Intelligent dis
cussion of the schemes that will
soon be presented will lead to good
results. To understand the ques
tion is then the first duty of every
Stanford student.
