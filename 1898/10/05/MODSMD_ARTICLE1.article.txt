# LAST NIGHT'S LECTURE.
## Professor Howard Talks on "The Public University and the Public Teacher." 
### 
The lecture given last evening by
Dr. til. B. Howard in the chapel on
the " Public university and the
public teacher" would have been
appreciated by any intelligent au
dience, but was particularly
interesting to all university people.
Dr. Howard spoke as follows:
On The shores of California two
institutions have arisen which con
stitute a fact of profound signifi
cance. Each one constitutes an as
pect, a type of a public university,
which is essentially national in
character. The one is the child of
the State, supported and sustained
by its bounty; the other is inde
pendent and nourished by private
munificence.
To explain my meaning, I invite
your attention to four propositions.
First, the idea of the American uni
versity has already arisen, and it
is the result, of social evolution.
Distinguished critics, struck by
the evident disharmony in charac
ter, and shocked by the too frequent
shame of our swarming broods of
collegiate foundations, have denied
to us the possession of a single true
university, much less a university
system.
In its essential types the Ameri
can university has already ap
peared; and it is the product of
two-fold evolution, Un the one
hand, its roots are planted deep in
national experience and in national
policy; on the other, it has come as
a necessity of social progress.
In the old homes, popular educa
tion was looked upon as the proper
function of the clergy aided by pri
vate benevolence. Neither local nor
public taxation was thought of for
this purpose. In the new world,
the conception of the proper sphere
of local and state action was broad
ened. By the middle of the seven
teenth century, all ihe Massachu
setts towns were maintaining free
primary schools, and most of them
secondary schools, by local rates
voted by themselves; and long be
fore the Revolution primary educa
tion was practically compulsory
throughout New England. To New
England is chiefly due the honor
of having fostered into vigorous
life the American political senti
ment that the state should educate
her children as a safeguard to her
self.
From the idea of the public
school let lis now turn to the idea
of the public university. The Eng
lish universities were state institu
tions placed in subordination to a
church establishment, and that
same idea crept intri most of the
colonial institutions of this country.
They were created primarily to
supply a learned ministry and next
for tin'general public good. There
was no clear conception of the col
lege organism for the discharge of
social duty.
In 1787 was the first of the so
called " seminary" grants, and by
the Morrill Act of 1862, the idea
was firmly established of doing
something for society which the ex
isting colleges were not doing. Thus
was struck the key note of that so
cial utilitarianism which must more

iind more pervade the culture of
the future.
Already in many sections of the
country the state university is the
educational heart of the community.
The "nationalization'' of the Amer
ican university is already in large
measure accomplished.
The university, like the public
school, has come as a necessity of
social progress. The character of
the fully differentiated American
university will be moulded by
forces which are changing our en
tire conception of man and his
proper place in the universe. With
out doubt the disclosure of the true
nature of the social organism in
consequence of the discovery of the
law of evolution constitutes one of
the greatest crises in human history.
In the realization of the perfected
type of the university of the future
two forces will co-operate, the great
private foundations and the state
universities. To the latter belong
the general average attainment,
possibly the great private founda
tions may be best lilted for educa
tional experimentation, for the
function of leadership.
►Secondly, how may the idea of
the American public university be
realized?^
The traditional conception of the
purpose of academic culture must
be abandoned. The scholastic cul
ture of the future will embrace
more and more of those practical
arts and vocations which are use
tu 1 to men. Do not misunder
stand me. Doubtless the tendency
to look upon education as a mere
tool for money-getting is our beset
ting sin. W hat 1 insist upon is
the compatibility of the spiritual
and the practical. The new cul
ture will be nobly democratic. Its
distinguishing mark will be the
possession of social power.
Thirdly comes the manifest des
tiny of the West. To the West,
apparently, must belong the greater
part of the realization of the ulti
mate type of the American char
acter 'With the exception of
Washington," writes I'rofessor Wil
son, "'the typical Americans have
all been Western men." Reflect
upon the character and vastness of
its present and future population,
it is an organic fusion of the cour
age and energy and genius of the
Aryan stock. From that fusion,
physically and mentally must pro
ceed the higher type of American.
Never before has there been so
much need of the conservative
boldness of trained minds. There
must be an intellectual awakening
in the \\ est. It is high time seri
ously to consider the rank which
our nation shall take in literature
and in art. There must be an
icsthetic awakening. What higher
function can the public university
discharge than to arouse the ics
thetic perception of the American
people? I»ut we shall never reach
a loity intellectual plane without
social regeneration. Politically
this nation must be horn again.
Finally, for the best realization
of the public university there must
be a clearer recognition of the true
oflice of the public teacher, of the
ideal character of the true teacher,
what he should be, and of the ideal
character of the Western student.
