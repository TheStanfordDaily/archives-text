Lasjt spring Stanford celebrated
Washington's Birthday in a most
appropriate manner. Our gather
ing held in the chapel to discuss the
carrying out of Washington's plan
fora National University was one
of the many held on that night
throughout the country. Probably
not one of us left the hall without
feeling a desire to see such an insti
tution made possible, and a willing
ness to help toward that end. That
desire to help has resulted, among
Stanford women, in the formation
of a Washington Memorial Associa
tion, which is to meet tomorrow to
formulate plans for the year. They
â€¢ all upon all other women of the
University and vicinity who are
interested to meet with them. .Sev
eral attractive plans for the year's
work have been suggested. The
success of any one of these will de
pend on having many heads and
many hands to help. Little will it
be to Stanford's credit if the call
for aid go unheeded.
