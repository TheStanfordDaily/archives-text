# Concerning Exemption of the University Property From Taxation.
## 
### 
Resolution passed by the Alumni
Association of Leland Stanford Jun
ior University at the annual meet
ing held on Alumni Day, May 24,
1898, and now sent out by the as
sociation for the purpose of calling
attention of the graduates and those
interested in the welfare of the
University in the matter of exemp
tion from taxation of the Univer
sity property. «
Whereas, by the provisions of
our State constitution, our Univer
sity is paying and is compelled to
pay taxes on all of its property, and
accordingly its resources are just so
far lessened, while in other States
liberal exemptions of the property
of like institutions, which is used
for educational purposes, are made
and thus such institutions are en
couraged and aided rather than
crippled; and
Whereas, there seems to be no
reason in justice or sound policy
why our State should not follow the
example of other States and help
rather than hinder the institutions
of higher learning within its bor
ders; therefore be it
Resolved, by the Alumni Associ
ation of Leland Stanford Junior
University, that the alumni, ex
students, and friends of the Uni
versity be and they are hereby
urged to use all proper means to
remedy this unfortunate condition
of our State law; and that to that
end this association suggests and
recommends the following action
on their part as best adapted to
accomplishing the desired result:
First, that all vote and lead
others to vote in favor of holding a
constitutional convention when the
question of such a convention is
presented to the people for decision
at the next election. In a constitu
tional convention, when other alter
ations are being made, the changes
we desire may more easily be ob
tained.
Secondly, that everything pos
sible and proper be done to have
nominated and elected to our next
Legislature men who, in case the
constitutional convention should
not be ordered by the people, will
vote to refer to the people of the
State an amendment to our consti
tution exempting such property
used for educational purposes as is
usually exempt in other States.
