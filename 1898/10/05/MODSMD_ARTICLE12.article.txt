# Concerning Exemption of the University Property From Taxation.
## 
### 
Resolution passed by the Alumni
Association of Leland Stanford Jun
ior University at the annual meet
ing held on Alumni Day, May 24,
1898, and now sent out by the as
sociation for the purpose of calling
attention of the graduates and those
interested in the welfare of the
University in the matter of exemp
tion from taxation of the Univer
sity property. «
Whereas, by the provisions of
our State constitution, our Univer
sity is paying and is compelled to
pay taxes on all of its property, and
accordingly its resources are just so
far lessened, while in other States
liberal exemptions of the property
of like institutions, which is used
for educational purposes, are made
and thus such institutions are en
couraged and aided rather than
crippled; and
Whereas, there seems to be no
reason in justice or sound policy
why our State should not follow the
example of other States and help
rather than hinder the institutions
of higher learning within its bor
ders; therefore be it
Resolved, by the Alumni Associ
ation of Leland Stanford Junior
University, that the alumni, ex
students, and friends of the Uni
versity be and they are hereby
urged to use all proper means to
remedy this unfortunate condition
of our State law; and that to that
end this association suggests and
recommends the following action
on their part as best adapted to
accomplishing the desired result:
First, that all vote and lead
others to vote in favor of holding a
constitutional convention when the
question of such a convention is
presented to the people for decision
at the next election. In a constitu
tional convention, when other alter
ations are being made, the changes
we desire may more easily be ob
tained.
Secondly, that everything pos
sible and proper be done to have
nominated and elected to our next
Legislature men who, in case the
constitutional convention should
not be ordered by the people, will
vote to refer to the people of the
State an amendment to our consti
tution exempting such property
used for educational purposes as is
usually exempt in other States.
C. K. Field, Pres.,
C. S. Stoltenbkkg, Sec.
The Alumni Association calls at
tention to the following facts in re
lation to the foregoing resolution:
1. The following provisions of
our constitution control the matter
oi taxation of our University prop
erty :
Art. IV, Sec. 25. The Legislature
shall not pass local or special laws
in any of the following enumerated
cases, that is to say:
Tenth: For the assessment or
collection of taxes.
Nineteenth: Granting to any cor
poration, association, or individual
any special or exclusive right, priv
ilege, or immunity.
Twentieth: Exempting property
from taxation.
Art. XIII. Revenue and Taxa
tion. —Sec. 1. All property in the
State, not exempt under the laws
of the United States,shall be taxed
in proportion to its value, to be as
certained as provided by law. The
word "property," as used in this
article and section, is hereby de
clared to include moneys, credits,
bonds, stocks, dues, franchises, and
all other matters and things, real,
personal, and mixed, callable of
private ownership; provided, that
property used for free public libra
ries and free museums, growing
crops, property used exclusively for
public schools, and such as may
belong to the United States, this
State, or to any county or munici
pal corporation within this State,
shall be from taxation.
The Legislature may provide, ex
cept in case of credits secured by
mortgage or trust deed, fora de
duction from credits of debts due
to bona fide residents of this State.
2. These provisions of the consti
tution make it possible that any
action of the Legislature exempt
ing the University property from
taxation would be unconstitutional.
It will be much better, therefore, to
do it by constitutional amend
ment. That amendment can only
be secured by a constitutional con
vention or by the Legislature refer
ring such an amendment to the
people, and the vote of the people
in its favor. The aim of the plan
suggested in the resolution is to get
an amendment submitted to tne
people either by a constitutional
convention or by the Legislature.
And to that end the immediate ef
forts of the friends of the Univer
sity should be devoted to securing
at the coming election votes in
favor of the calling of the constitu
tional convention. Such a conven
tion, it is believed, would draft a
constitution with provisionson this
point in conformity to those found
in the laws of all other civilized
States.
o. The following summary of the
law in other States shows the gen
eral trend of constitutions and leg
islation 011 the subject:
a. With the exception of Cal
ifornia, Idaho, Nevada, New Mex
ico, Utah, Wyoming, and probably
Wisconsin —the legislation in that
State is obscure —all the States of
the Union exempt property devoted
to educational purposes. Usually
all the property of educational in
stitutions, real or personal, is ex
empted, but in some cases it is lim
ited to from one to forty acres of
land, in lowa to six hundred and
forty acres.
B.i n nearly all of the States of
the Union property devoted to li
brary and scientific purposes is ex
empted from taxation.
c. With the exception of Califor
nia, Idaho, Oklahoma, and prob
ably New Jersey, all property
devoted to purely charitable pur
poses is exempted from taxation.
d. 111 some States there are in
stances of special legislation. Har
vard University, Brown University,
and Princeton are thus specially
exempted. 111 New York there is a
rather complicated provision for
exemption of institutions of learn
ing.
These facts show that what the
University is seeking in the way of
exemption is no more or greater
than what is accorded similar in
stitutions in almost every other
State in the Union.
