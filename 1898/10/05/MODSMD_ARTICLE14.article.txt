# The 						Art Department's New Studios.

### 
The building for the department
of Drawing and Painting has been
completed and the department will
go into it in a few days.
As the gift from Mrs. Barron
with which it was built came in
the form of a lump sum, the build
ing was so designed as to secure
the greatest amount of space and
light to be had for that sum. To
this end Professor Brown has de
signed merely a row of large work
rooms. The building contains, be
sides the four large studios, two
offices. Its east-and-west length is
112 l'eet and its width is 36
feet. This gives over 4000 feet of
floor space. Excepting the offices
the building is lighted solely by
one continuous belt of glass eight
feet wide, which forms the upper
half of the entire north wall.
Ample and steady light is thus
secured, since at no time will the
sun enter the rooms. The light
coming in so high up gives neither
exactly a side light nor a skylight,
but lias some of the advantages of
each. The whitened ceiling makes
the room luminous without de
stroying the shadows.
For the first eight feet upward
from the floor the walls will be
covered with a gray, green, or terra
cotta material especially adapted to
serve as a background for sketches
and drawings. Heat will be sup
plied by a large "air-tight" stove
in each studio.
in the westernmost room will be
carried on Miss Kiske'sclass in cast
and figure drawing. The students of
painting will work under Professor
Brown in the next studio; while in
the third and largest room the first
year classes in drawing and per
spective under Professor Clark will
be held. It is intended, also, to
shut off the light and make this an
audience room for lantern lectures.
The remaining and smallest studio
is for use in portrait work.
Thus the very timely and very
much appreciated gift of Mrs. Bar
ron enables the art work here to be
carried on with all the material ad
vantages possible, for there are no
studios anywhere that give students
greater advantages in light and
space, and very few that give as
great. Simple as these work-rooms
are they serve their purpose quite
perfectly; and they are, moreover,
it is believed, the first studios evei
built for university art work.
