Now that the tennis courts have
been placed in first-class condition
it would be most encouraging to see
them used immediately by those
who intend to try for the tennis team
next spring. While it is somewhat
discouraging to many of the play

jacks" in college this year, it is
quite probable that there will be
more than two representatives from
each college in the tournament.
Such being the case we will be much
more dependent upon the mediocre
players than ever before. And now
is the time for them to begin their
preparati ons.
