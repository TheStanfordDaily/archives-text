We need more freshmen on the
football field. Yesterday afternoon
scarcely enough men turned out to
make up the eleven which was
beaten by Santa Clara. There
is no reason why there should
not be candidates enough to
form two freshmen elevens, es
pecially at this early part of the
season when there can be no defi
nite selection of those who will
finally compose the team. There
are many places to be filled, especi
ally in the line, and much of the
future success of the team will de
pend on the spirit shown by the
freshmen "second eleven."
