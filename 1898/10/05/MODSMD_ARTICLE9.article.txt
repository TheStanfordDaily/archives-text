The club-room of Encina Hall
will be thrown open to the men of
the University Friday evening for
a rally in honor of the coach, cap-
tain, and football team. Encina
Hall is naturally the rallying place
for Stanford men, and a determined
effort is to be made this year to

keep it so. The affair Friday even
ing is primarily a rally, but other
features are being arranged which
should make the evening enjoyable.
The most important feature is the
gathering of the men of the Univer
sity and the opportunity for closer
acquaintance. To make this rally
a success, the hall desires the pres
ence of every man in the Univer
sity. The continuance of the cus
tom will depend upon its reception;
its establishment will add a pleas
ant feature to our social life.
