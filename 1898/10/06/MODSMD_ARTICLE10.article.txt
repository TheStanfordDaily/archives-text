We have heard until we sire sick
of it that our University is crowded.
Every department is cramped for
space. So it is with great relief
that we see a building going up
that will accommodate our present
library and give ample room for
expansion for many years; and it
is pleasing to know that next year
there will be a hall large enough to
contain the audience that gathers
fora Tuesday evening lecture.
There is no department that has
worked under greater disadvantages
with regard to equipment and ac
commodations than the Art depart
ment. So when Mrs. Barron do
nated the money which made
possible the commodious and con
venient building that has been pre
pared for that department, slit?
earned the gratitude not only of the
art students but of the University
at large. That gratitude is hers.
