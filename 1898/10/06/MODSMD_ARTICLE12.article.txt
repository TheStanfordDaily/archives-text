Ykstkhday's contest with the
Kansas Volunteers showed us many
tilings about our team. It showed
up clearly both its weak and its
strong points. On the whole the
exhibition was encouraging. The
soldiers were heavier than we in
the center of the line, and they hit
the center of our line often, usually
gaining. On the other hand when*
ever we had the ball we gained.
These are interesting points, but
wlur is more interesting is that our
learn was in a hard contest, ami we
were clearly out-rooted. The sol
diers gave their men four times the
support that we gave ours. This
lack of yelling in a contest is a re
sult of the apathy with which we
watch the daily practice. It was
hoped that the recent appointment
of yell leaders would put energy
into the grandstand, but as yet
this change has not been effected.
Instead of encouraging the players
each night we have taken to criti
cizing them; and what is more rep
rehensible, some have " joshed"
them. A man on the Stanford
football field, especially at a time
like this, is no object for our josh
ing. He deserves encouragement.
The team candidates are doing their
best. Up to date we have not done
ours.
