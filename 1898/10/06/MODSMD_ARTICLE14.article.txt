The following is an extract from
a letter written by Robert W. Dotkl,
'00, who enlisted last May, to A. E.
Monteith, '00:
Manila, August 17, 1898.
Long before this reaches you you
will have heard all about the cap
ture of Manila. The capture of the
town was a comparatively easy
thing, and you can not imagine
with what joy we were received by
the people there. Everybody was
happy but the Spanish officers.
The Spanish soldiers were particu
larly happy inasmuch as it meant
to them their liberation from the
commands of the cruel oflicers.
These officers and commanders
kept the army together only by in
citing the soldiers with the most
cruel tales about the Americans,
all of which the ignorant soldiers
believed until we came face to face
with-then and they found us to be,
not what we had been pictured by
the Spanish commanders, a blood
thirsty mob, but men who had
come to reach the hand of freedom
to an oppressed people.
The tirst engagement 1 was in
was on August 1. V, e were un
der tire off and on from 8 p.m. to
1:30 in the morning. All this
time we were lying in the trenches
covered with mud up to the waist.
When we got out we could scarcely
walk; our knees were swollen so
that we could hardly bend them.
And these trenches, by the way, we
had to put 14) under a heavy lire,
but we lost very few of our men.
Our hearts are now turning
toward "Dear old Stanford," and
many of us can see the happy
crowds gathering in the quad once
more, and the lonely freshman
wandering around the arcades. 1
want you to tell the boys that
''Company K," although it has en
countered hardship, heat, and water
storms all along the line, yet it has
always cheered joyfully when
orders from "Uncle Sam" have
come to charge against the Spanish
trenches.
When orders were received to
march on Manila we knew that
20,000 Spaniards were waiting fori
us. We were only about 12,000
strong. In the charge the Ist Cali
fornia was in reserve, but when or
ders were given fora general attack
we broke through everything and
came into the city ahead of the
others.
It was a touching scene in the
afternoon when all the Spanish
army lined-up and handed over
their guns to our generals. Many
of them were crying, but when they
heard that the American soldiers
would protect them from the Phil
ippines (who, by the way, sup
posed they could follow us into the
city) they were overjoyed. The
Spanish officers and soldiers were
allowed to go to their homes in
Manila and we were posted around
the outskirts of town to prevent
the Philippinos from entering the
city with arms. That night 6,000
Philippines delivered up their
arms and since that time things
have been running smoothly.
We are glad, however, that our
trench-guard and night skirmishes
are over, and we are beginning to
look homeward with some degree of
cheerfulness. Rumors are afloat
that we may yet eat our Christmas
dinner in California. Now that
the war is over we are hoping that
this may be true, for this is a place
where one realizes what home and
humanity are worth.
1 forgot to say that when we en
tered the citv the natives were so
glad to see us that they got into
