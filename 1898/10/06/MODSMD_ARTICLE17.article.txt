There will be a rally in Encina
Club-room tomorrow night to give
the team a send-off for its tirst
schedule game of the season.
Coach Cross, who saw last Sat
urday's game between the Univer
sity of California and the Olympic
Club, will tell what he thinks of the
comparative strength of Berkeley's
team and ours. There will also be
speeches by Captain Fisher and the
men who will play Saturday and
by others.
The entertainment committee of
Encina Club has arranged a pro
gram which will be carried out
after the "rally. The Glee and
Mandolin Clubs have promised to
be present and to take part.
There will be several boxing
matches, those at present arranged
being between Hinman, '01, and
Foster, '01, and between liard, '02,
and Downing, '02. Others will
very probably take place.
A wrestling bout between Steele,
'01, and White, '00. should prove
an exciting event as both are
clever wrestlers and very evenly
matched. All through the evening
there will be "stag" dances.
