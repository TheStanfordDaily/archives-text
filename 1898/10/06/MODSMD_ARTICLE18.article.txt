### 
A new motor has been placed in
the wood-working shops at an ex
pense of $500. The old machine, it
will he remembered, nearly caused
a conflagration during the first
semester hist year, burning a hole
in the floor before the fire was dis
covered. The new machine is of
j much higher power and is entirely
I sufficient for the present needs of
the shops. It is enclosed in a room
built at the southeast corner of the
building, t his room was built by
I students in the shop under the sup
ervision of Instructor Soule.
The wood-working department is
I gaining in popularity, almost every
, available bench space being occu
pied. The number of young ladies
i taking a course in manual training
in the department this year is
noticeably larger than in previous
i years.
