# Athletic Improvements at Harvard.
## 
### 
Harvard graduates in Boston
have given $14,000 to the athletic
committee for use in improvement
of Soldiers' Field. During the
summer changes were made which
will increase the ground available
for athletic purposes to forty acres —
twice the present area. All of the
space between the Field on the
north and the new dyke along the
river lias been tilled with gravel
and graded. *
About forty acres of marsh land
will still remain within the new
dyke. This will be allowed to re
main unimproved fora year or two
in the hope that the protracted dry
ing out will reduce greatly the work
necessary to put this part of the
Field in condition for athletics.
New York graduates have already
about $18,000 of the necessary
<$25,000 Jor the new varsity boat
house. The war stopped further
collection, but work on the boat
house will probably begin next
spring. The park commission has
reserved to Harvard a river frontage
from the bridge westward, lioth
banks of the river will be built up
alike.
The Locker building has been
fitted up for the use of the varsity
and class teams. A new boiler has
been put in for the steam-heating
plant. Electric lights will be placed
in the cage to permit indoor foot
ball practice. A tablet will be
placed in the building in memory
of Henry Carey, who gave the
(Jarey building on Holmes Field.
The running track around the foot
ball field has been completed and
is now practically ready for use.
A nine-foot open-work iron fence
will be erected around the entire
held. The park couiinisssion will
erect that on the north, while the
compensation for the strip taken
by the city of Boston to widen
North Harvard street will pay for
the rest of the fence. —Harvard
Crimson.
