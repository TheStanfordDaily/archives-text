# REPLY TO THE "ARGONAUT."
## Dr. Jordan to State His True Position on the Eastern Question in the "Evening Post." 
### 
Last (Saturday's Argonaut con
tained an article stating that Dr.
Jordan had changed his views on
the question of the colonial expan
sion of the United {States. We are
permitted to quote from a letter
from Dr. Jordan that will appear
in next Saturday's Post.
Editor Evening Post.
i can only say that 1 accept the
statement of the Argonaut as in
most respects just. My chief criti
cism is a slight one. In u Lest We
Forget," 1 think that 1 did full
justice to the possibility that we
had already gone too far to with
draw from responsibility for Cuba,
and perhaps for other islands also.
It is easier for men and nations to
eat their words than it is to ignore
accomplished facts.
it is certain that we must annex
Cuba and Porto Rico sooner or
later, for in self-government uncon
trolled by American influence these
u black republics" would fall to the
level of Hayti. There is no other
nation which can handle their
problems as well as we, and they
are near enough to lead public
opinion to protect them from the
grosser forms of tyranny, neglect,
and corruption.
We must take the Antilles, not
because we want them, but because
we have no friends that will hold
tnem and give us no trouble. 1
look 'or great industrial develop
ment in Cuba, but ideals of civil vir
tue will not tbnve in the tropics.
The reasons for holding the Phil
ippines are much less cogent. The
islands are far less suited for free
institutions. They are distant and
scattered and their population is
as "unAmerican" as any people
can be.
The longer we hold Manila and
the more of money and life we in
vest there, the harder it will be to
withdraw. Moreover, to withdraw
at all, after the glorious work of
our navy there, seems obtaining
patriotism under false pretenses.
If we take Manila it will be to her
advantage as a commercial center,
but at great cost to us. More army
and navy we need, beyond question,
but for America to become a "mil
itary and naval power" is for bet
to invite disintegration and degen
eration. The spirit of imperialism
is the most dangerous that ever
came over the American people.
The business of America is to de
velop American manhood so that
government by the people may be
good government.
We have no machinery for the
good government of dependent
provinces, nor do we want any.
Our experience with Alnska, a mis
erable, neglected, misunderstood,
mismanaged outpost of our civiliza
tion, shows plainly what we shall
do with the Philippines. We shiill
use them to pay political debts,
load on them the offscourings of
our politics, starve them with our
parsimony while the oflicers we
send them will grow fat with the
waste. Until the time is past when
any senator can dcma'nd a federal
office for any henchman we are not

prepared to handle any diilicult
problem through federal officials.
1 believe that whatever comes of
the Philippine question we shall
finally steer clear of imperialism.
This crisis is already passed, even
though we may have the most un
desirable properly in the world left
on our hands.
In a recent talk 1 had occasion
to say:
The only righteous thing to do
would be to recognize the inde
pendence of the Philippines under
American protection and to lend
them our army and navy and our
wisest counselors, not politicians,
but Dewey and Merritt, with jur
ists, foresters, mining engineers,
civil engineers, and experts in
science and manufacture.
If, after they have had a fair
chance, the experiment of self-gov
ernment fails, then we should turn
them over quietly to the paternal
ism of peace-loving Holland or
peace-compelling Great Britain.
We should not get our money back,
but we should save our honor.
