The rally in the Encina club
room tomorrow night ought to be
largely attended. Lt is time that
the student body began to assume
the old-time enthusiasm which is
expressed by cheers, but so far this
year has been largely unexpressed.
On Saturday our team plays the
first schedule game of the year, and
it is hoped that a big crowd will be
on the grounds to cheer for them.
Everybody should at least go to the
rally. Not only will this encour
age the football men and increase
our own interest in the team, but the
entertainment that has been pre
pared to come after the speeches
will lie extremely interesting, with
its boxing and wrestling bouts, stag
dance, and everything that pertains
to an Encina football rally.
