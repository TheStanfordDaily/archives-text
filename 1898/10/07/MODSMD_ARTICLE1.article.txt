# JUNIOR HIGH JINKS.
## The
						Ceremonies and Spiels That Introduced "Plug Ugly" to the Student Body. 
### 
The dedication of the Junior
Ting Ugly last night was an un
qualified success from every point
of view, from the time when the
tirst bugle-call heralded the Grand
Marshal and his mystic crew, to
the linal Grand Dislocation. Each
one of the principals took his part
well, and an appreciative crowd
made the most of every opportu
nity to applaud, yet in no case did
they interfere with the speakers.
Considering the impromptu na
ture of the entertainment, and the
liability to interruption, not only
does the .1 unior Class deserve credit,
but also the other classes, who by
forbearing to interrupt aided ma
terially in the success of the even
ing.
i he main credit among the Jun
iors is due, as far as the originating
and carrying the idea out, to \Y. A.
Irwin, Alfred Haslacher, F. J
Perry, and Bristow Adams, al
though all the actors not only
carried out their parts but composed
them. The neat program which
was sold at the performance and
is now on sale at Wilson's for all
those who desire a souvenir, was
arranged by Bristow Adams, who
took the part of Poet Maniac, and
recited the " Owed."
It, has been suggested that
Sequoia should publish an account
in full, with all the speeches, but
it was decided among the members
of the class that the story should
bo saved for the Junior Annual,
where it could be given as a special
feature with illustrations. The
Palo Alto is, however, able to give
a fair synopsis of events with some
of the ritual.
The tirst trumpet flare heralded
the approach of the Lord Chief
Marshal of the Order of the Plug,
Sublime Aide to 11 is Uoyal Chops,
Partaker of the Umpty-Steenth

of the Awful Plug, which was
awaiting in the woods for its cue.

Silence fell on the shouting mul
titudes when the Introductory
Spiel of the Grand Marshal rang
out on the night air. "O ye," he
began, "who have attained unto
Junior standing, O ve who have
sixty hours credit; O ye who have
walked uprightly in the eyes of the
faculty and have not tread in the
straight and narrow path that leads
to Mavfield; 0 ye who have not en
countered the dread disease that
blights the eyes and have consis
tently shunned the Faculty Com
mittee on Students' Affairs; give ear!
"And it came to pass on the
twenty-first day of May in the year
of our Lord one thousand eight
hundred and ninety-eight, and of
our University the sixth, that Doc
tor Elliott came unto the Juniors
who had not fallen by the way-side,
and said, 'Take ye up your cards
and walk'; and they marveled
greatly thereat, but said, 'Great is
the Faculty, and greatly to bo
praised.'
"And there arose in the land a
tile, and it was a long felt want —
and it was a long felt hat. And in
the Class of '99 were barbarians
who knew not the tile, and wore it
not, saying, 'Verily we have cold
feet, and have not the tin.'
"But there arose in the land the
great Adams, and be was a mighty
man of strength from Spokane; and
the Juniors cried unto him with a
great voice saying, 'Be thou our
president,' and he answered unto
them, 'Right ye are, and dead
keen,' and he was their president.
And he said, 'Let there lie plugs.'
And there was piugs; and they
seen that they was good. And lo
and behold, there was a mighty
shout and great rejoicing, and ver
ily I say unto you, 'The plugs shall
be worn, now and forevermore,
world without end. Amen!'"
After a responsive service came
the Chant of the Tall Tile, which
ran as follows:
"Sic semper maginnis, terra
lirina nox vomica weinerwurst, E
pluribus unum, in hoc signo bohun
kus, Cicero ate a hot tomale habeas
corpus, A men! —Ah there!"
Then came what was perhaps the
best burlesque of the evening, the
Woeful Wailing of Weeping Willie,
who of course in his blindness could
see none of the virtues of the Class
of '99.
"Ah, woe is me! Alas, alack, and
well-a-day! Ver'ly there is woe in
the air tonight, and much sauer
bawl! Weep, weep, all weep! Let
there be weeping and wailing and
gnashing of teeth! I weep for
Ninety-nine. 1 weep for the Fresh
man football team; I weep for the
rush that must not be but Ninety
nine! —1 weep for Ninety-nine. Four
times did they gird up their loins
and go forth to do battle in the
hey-day of their youth, but the
Glass of' 99 cutteth but little ice.
They went forth to rip, but, like
'Guilty,'they rippeth not, neither
do they tear, and verily I say unto
you that 'Guiby' in all the glory
of his punktitude was not so punk
as one of these! Did they win a
rush?" (Chorus:) "Nit!" "Did
they play football?" (Chorus:)
"Nit!" "Yea, nit!—forty-four to
nit! O, woe! Alas! Alas!"
Then the different custodians

and equerries gave addresses con
cerning their duties, which were
terminated by the Cabalistic Invo
cation to the great and awful Plug
to '"come forth!"
It came, a monster plug, only
eight feet high, borne in the Grand
Procession by the Minor Plug Ug
lies, with their ugly plugs, and ac
companied by the Poet Maniac,
who recited his "owed" with appro
priate maniacal gestures.
The Song of a Gondolier gave a
new turn to t he old chorus:
"Like every honest Junior 1 like
my milk—
That's queer!
And I join the temperance
chorus of the
Song of a gondolier!"
After the oaths of office and con
ferring of degrees eametheelass and
college yells and the Grand Dislo
cation, whereupon the Plug paraded
the campus, ably escorted, and was
finally lodged in Encina Club
room.
Thus ended the greatest outdoor
class ceremony that Stanford has
ever seen.
