The game with the Olympics to
morrow will probably bring to light
many things concerning our Var
sity that have heretofore remained
unobserved. The strength of this
week's Olympic team, which is by
no means the same eleven that was
defeated by Berkeley last Saturday
by a score of 17-0, will probably be
able to make the deficiencies of our
eleven apparent enough. The game
should be an interesting one and
should result in victory for Stan
ford.
