There has been much complaint
lately about the promiscuous bor
rowing of bicycles. Things have
come to such a pass that a man's
wheel is not safe unlocked, and while
it is an inconvenience to find one's
bicycle missing for the space of a
few hours or more, it becomes a
serious matter when a bicycle goes
for good. There is one case where
a man bought a new wheel and lost
it the first time he rode it. But he
had to keep on paying instalments
just the same, without the use of
his bicycle. Those who are mere
borrowers should first get permis
sion of wheel owners, and those

who own wheels should keep a
sharp look-out for the persons who
are assuredly not collegians, and
are apt to want something for no
thing.
