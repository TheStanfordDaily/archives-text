We desire to call the attention of
all to the mass meeting which has
been announced for next Thursday
evening in Encina gymnasium for
the purpose of presenting and con
sidering the taxation question. We
understand that alumni from San
Francisco, San Jose, and other
places will be present, and that
speeches will be made by leading
alumni, as well as by students and
others, in which the whole question
involved will be thoroughly ex
plained. The way in which the
alumni are taking up this matter
ought to be an inspiration to take
an active part in the work which
has to be done. There is no doubt
that the mass meeting will be well
attended, and that the gymnasium
will be filled, but we ought to do
more than that. Every student in
the University should post himself
on the facts, which have already
been given in articles in this paper,
and they should go to the meeting
ready to take an active interest and
to act in the matter intelligently.
Stanford enthusiasm is well known.
Let us have a display of it on this
occasion that will assure the alumni
that we are ready to help them and
that will show to the people of the
State that we are in earnest in our
endeavors to free Stanford from the
present unjust and unwise taxation.
