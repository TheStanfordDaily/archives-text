The various literary societies will |
tomorrow evening select two repre- '
sentatives each to enter the semi
final preliminary contests for the
Carnot debate in accordance with
the schedule recently adopted by
the executive committee. In addi
tion to those selected in this way,
any student may enter the prelim
inaries by presenting his name to
Secretary S. 1\ Elias of the Inter
society Executive League before
next Wednesday noon. It is hoped
that this new system of finals and
semi-finals will greatly stimulate
debating interests and enable the
University to send the strongest
possible teams to represent us in
the Carnot and intercollegiate con
tests this year.
Below are published the pro
grams to be given by the different
societies tomorrow evening. The
meetings are held at 7:30 every
Saturday night and visitors are
welcome.
