# Yesterday's Practice.
## 
### 
Enough material was on hand
last evening for four elevens and
over. The second eleven had the
ball must of the time, the Varsity
being practiced on defensive work.
Fickert was out, showing the var
sity candidates for guards how
the position should be played.
The line-up was as follows:
VARSITY SECOND
Smith 1 end r Daggett
Rusk 1 tackle r Faris
â€¢James 1 guard r. MacKinnon
Biglow center Gil man
Blanchard . . r guard 1 Fickert
Wilson r tackle 1.. .
McFadd en . . . r end 1 Nourse
Murphy quarter Beck ley
Dole 1 half r. . . . .Emerson
Fisher r half 1 Hill
Burmister full Parkin
The play, which was quite
snappy, lasted something over half
an hour. The center men, espec
ially James and Biglow, are al
ready showing some improvement.
Parker was laid off because of a
sore neck.
Indications are fora close fight
for tackle between Beckett and
Wilson.
Touchdowns were made last
evening by Dole, who made a clever
run around the right end, and by
Hill, who bucked clear of ail the
Varsity.
For the Varsity, Dole, Fisher,
Burmister, and James played the
best game. Hill, Emerson, and
Faris distinguished themselves on
the second.
