Hrown '78, who was one of the vic
tims of the French liner Bourgoyne
last summer, has left $2000 to his
Alma Mater. "The same to be
added to the $2000 which 1 gave to
the university in 1898 as a founda
tion fora scholarship, and increas
ing said scholarship to $4000, or if
it seems best to the authorities of
the university, the whole amount
may be divided into two scholar
ships." The will was executed
only four days before the death of
the testator, the date of execution
being June 80, 1898, just prior to
his leaving for New York to go on
board the steamer.
Other institutions benefited by
the will are the Anglican College
in .Jerusalem, the Palestine Explo
