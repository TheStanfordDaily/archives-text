# Two Games Tomorrow.
## 
### 
The Varsity football eleven will
play its first schedule game with
the Olympic Club team in San
Francisco tomorrow afternoon. It
will be our first opportunity of see
ing what our men can do with a
good team and should attract in
terest accordingly.
Since the California-Olympic
game last Saturday the club eleven
has been practicing every night
and should play far better than
they did against California last
week. Several changes in the
make-up of the team have been
made with the result that the men
will average heavier. "Pete"
Smith, who was injured in the
game on Saturday, may not be able
to play.
When speaking of our prospects
Coach Cross said: "Our men have
done good work the past week, and
should win to-morrow, and unless
the Olympic team is changed so as
to make it more formidable, 1 think
they will."
Captain Fisher will take twenty
or twenty-five men with him, but
he is uncertain as to whether the
team will be changed in the second
half. He will line the Varsity up
as follows: Parker, right end; Wil
son, right tackle; Blanchard, right
guard; Biglow, center; James, left
guard; Rusk, left tackle; Smith,
left end; MurplnC, quarter; Fisher,
right half; Dole, left half; Burmis
ter, full back.
The Freshman team plays its
first game off the campus tomorrow,
when it lines up against the Lowell
High School at Recreation Park at
10:80 a.m. A large number of stu
dents have signified their intention
of being present to do their part
toward winning the first of two vic
tories tomorrow.
