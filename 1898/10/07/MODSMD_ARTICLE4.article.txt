# TAXATION RALLY.
## Alumni and Students Call a Mass Meeting to Start the Anti-Taxation Movement. 
### 
It was suggested last night in tiie
Daily Palo Alto that a wise way
to bring the taxation question to
the attention of every student would
he to have a mass meeting at which
the subject may be personally pre
sented and a clear understanding
of it given to all. In accordance
with this idea it has been decided
to hold such a meeting. The fol
lowing call is therefore published
that all may be notified of its time,
place, and character.
We, the undersigned, believing
that no better way of bringing the
taxation question to the attention of
every student and of arousing that
universal active interest in the mat
ter which it deserves, exists than
that of holding a mass meeting, have
decided to call such a meeting for
next Thursday evening, October 13,
at 7:30 o'clock in Encina gymnas
ium.
At this meeting the question will
be presented by alumni and stu
dents who understand it, so that
everyone may be thoroughly in
formed on what the University
needs, how it may be obtained, and
the methods of work. It is hoped
also that some sort of an organiza
tion may be effected which will give
unity and power to our efforts.
Everyone interested in thequestion,
whether students, alumni, or friends
of the University, is invited and
urged to be present.
