TO NEED GLASSES
is one thing; to be properly fitted is <|iiite
another. We find a difference in the eyes in
about ONE'HALF the cases which come tons
for glasses. This shows the necessity of having
each eye fitted independent ot the other. If
yon are a wearer of glasses, undoubtedly they
need adjusting—we do this without charge.
