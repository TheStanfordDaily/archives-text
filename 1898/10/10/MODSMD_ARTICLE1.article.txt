# OLYMPIC DEFEATED.
## The
						Varsity's First Scheduled Game an Easy Victory—Score 23-0. 
### 
The Varsity played its first
schedule game of the season Satur
day, when it met and defeated the
Olympics by the one-sided score of
23-0. The game was for the most
part uninteresting and does not
serve fora comparison to the
merits of the I'niversity teams
since it is a great problem as to
whether Berkeley met a weaker
team than Stanford or not. One
thing is certain, that both teams
from the Olympic Club were weak,
being composed of men not in
training.
The teams Saturday lined-up as
follows :

Olympic's play suffered mater
ially in the second half owing to
the poor condition of its men. Er
skine played the best game. King,
though slow ;it starting, has a good
way of going at ;i line.
Coach Cross said after the game:
"Our men did fairly well, consider
ing. Our line was not particularly
stable, their seeming improvement
in the second half being due largely
to the weariness of the Olympic
line. The ends and backs did well
enough. The team did just about
as well as I expected."
At a late hour this afternoon a
telephone message was received
from the Lowell management, stat
ing that the eleven would be unable
to play Wednesday as arranged.
