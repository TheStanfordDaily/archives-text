# Sunday's Sermon.

### 
I>r. J. K. McLean preached a
beautiful sermon in the chapel
yesterday morning, taking for his
text: "I am the door: l»v me if any
man enter in.he shall be saved,
and shall go in and out. and find
pasture." The fluent, easy con
versational delivery, the spontan
eity and aptness of hi- illustrations,
and the simplicity and power with
which he presented the lessons of
his text, afforded a real pleasure
and supplied abundant food for
thought, to all who listened to his
discourse. Following is a synopsis
of the sermon: Christ's parables;
are epitomes; they contain all that
can be thought about the subject.
Take for instance the parable of
the sower. Some seed fell bv the!
wayside upon ground that was
hard and non-receptive; some upon
stony ground, where the soil was
fertile but could not nourish the
seed to maturity because of its
shallowness; some fell among thorns
and was choked as it sprang up;
and some fell upon good ground,
bearing fruit. In civilized com
munities. about one-fourth of the
people are totally non-receptive to
any kind of teaching. Another
class, corresponding to the stony
ground, takes up every new fad and
"ism" which is invented; it is over
receptive but not deep and can re
tain nothing. A third class re
ceives and holds the truth, which,
however, is choked by the demands
of practical duties and pleasure; all
is intention, but nothing is pro
duced. The last class is the one
| that brings forth good fruit. This
parable implies everything to be
said about the subject; it is enacted
in every church, in every school
room, in every book.
Likewise in the story of the Good
Samaritan, the Pharasee represents
the class that is preoccupied and
indifferent to the suffering around
it.the Levite, that which notices
wrong but passes on; while the
Samaritan is the type of those who
j minister to the attlicted.
Using the analogy of the shep
herd Christ sets forth the essentials
for the care and culture of men;
safety, liberty, and plenty. To save
a sheep is not merely to snatch it
from danger, but to secure it for
the complete end and development
j for which it is intended. As the
sheep must be protected from the
wolf, so must man be saved from
the wolf —propensity of his own
nature and appetites. How can he
be better protected than by enter
ing through the door of belief in
, Christ's teachings within the wall
of strength imparted to those who
adopt Ifis theory and discipline of
life? When man lives out this
theory of human development, that
all things are given foi the accom
plishment of the service of Cod and
the enrichment of human life, these
evil inclinations have no power; he
is saved. Whatever view one pleases
to take of Jesus Christ, if he follows
tlii- theory of life, he will walk
strongly, directly, securely in the
divine appointments of life. Christ
is the door; whoso entereth in by
him i.-> saved.
P>ut a certain amount of liberty
is its necessary for sheep as i> safety;
they must go out as well ;is come
in. The best nations of the world
are those that have received, incor
porated and followed the teachings
of Christ. Christianity offers the
fullest development in every line of
thought. It gives liberty to the
mind and imagination.
The protection given to man by
entering through the door of Christ
into an understanding of the har
mony of things and the liberty thus

assured him, enables him to "find
pasture" and secure "plentv."
While working in harmony and
with the approval of heaven, every !
faculty is satisfied and nourished;
while exercising his liberty, man
comes into the fulness of enjoyment
of every realm of thought and sym
pathy.
