### 
Fora rally which preceded a
game of comparatively little im
portance. tht' one liel.J in Encina
Hall last Friday night was marked
by great enthusiasm. Students be
gan to gather early in the evening,
the tirst part of which was spent
in the singing of Stanford songs
and dancing.
0. C. Leiter. '99, as president of
Encina Club, presided over the
meeting and introduced the speak
ers. the tirst of whom was Captain
Fisher.
He said that he could assuie us
that his team would play the com
ing game for all it was worth and
would do all in its power to win
not only that one hut all of the
season. He said that lie was sorry
that owing to the various match
games of the past week it had not
been possible to change the team
about very much, but he assured
all the men who would get out that
each one should lie given a chance
to show what he can do. He had
a word of protest against the grand
stand laughing at any new men
who got out on the field and made
mistakes in their efforts to learn
the game and urged the most sym-.
pathetic support of the student
body.
Coach Cross next made a little
speech after the applause ha l
quieted sufficiently so that his
voice could be heard. He said that
when he left us year before last, it
was with the feeling that he was in
a very real way one of us and that
he discovered that lie had come
back among old friends. The sit
uation this year is serious and de
mands that everybody who has a
sound healthy boely get out on the
field and that all who are out
should forget all class antagonisms
of even* sort and play to win on
Thanksgiving dav. He. too, very
serious!v urged the unanimous,sup
port o: the entire student body for
every man who dons football clothes
and works on the field. \\ it bout
hard and constant and harmonious
work the prospect is not bright but
with it the result will be as it al
wavs has been. In conclusion he
told a little story of two frogs, a
Stanford frog and a California frog
who went traveling through a barn
yard together when they unfortun
ately fell into a milk can. " \\ hat
are vou going to do?" wailed the
California frog. " We've got to
hustle.'* said the Stanford frog.
The next morning, there was the
poor California froL r in the bottom
of the can, drowned. The Stanford
frog was contentedly floating around
on a chunk of butter he had churned
out during the night.
After the laughter and cries of.
"What's the matter with Cross?"
had subsided. Charlie Fickert was
called upon. He said he was afraid
that Berkeley would win this via • —
just as she did last year and the
year before. He had been looking
into the subject fora long time and
had come to tin' conclusion that i '
we did our best we could not losi —
the habit of winning was to* > stronel v
fixed.
Parker was called upon and voiced
the sentiments of the team when lie
said that he would play for all
there was in him every chance lie
got. After this, under the manage
ment of "Hilly'' Erb. the master of
ceremonies am seel la neons pro
gram was carried out. consisting of
selections by the <ilee and Man
dolin clubs, buck dancing by Claire
Strohn. boxing matches between
Daggett, '00 and Hard. '02. and
Foster. '01 and Hurkett. '02. and a
couple of interesting wrestling bouts
between McFadden. '00 and Steele.

'01. The rest of the evening was
filled out with dancing.
