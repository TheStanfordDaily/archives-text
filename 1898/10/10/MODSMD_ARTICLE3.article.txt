difficult goal. Score, 8 to 0. Onlv

two minutes of play remained in
which the Freshmen managed to
gain thirty yards.
ihe game served to show the
poor quality of team work pos
sessed hv the Freshmen. Time and
again some star individual playing
was t<» be seen, but the men could
not pull together. Many who had
seen the '02 team at Berkeley said
that our Freshmen were decidedly
inferior in team work.
Lowell lias two exceptionally
good men in Symines and Rooney.
1 he defensive play of the former is
particularly good. Rooney is a
good ground gainer.
The Freshman line did not seem
to get together. Though oppossed,
if anything, to lighter men, they
were at times clearly outplayed.
Downing played an excellent game.
His running was strong, and he
gained continually. Rodolph and
Geissler showed up better than at
any time this season.
