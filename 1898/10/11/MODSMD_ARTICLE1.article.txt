# YESTERDAY'S PRACTICE.
## Work Done by the Men on the Gridiron and the Details of the Play. 
### 
The men were rather s'ow getting
out for practice last evening, hut
ew being out until after half-past
four. Croft* put the men through
a short drill in lan tiling and fal
ling on theball.
1 h»* line-up was as'follows:
VARSITY SECOND
Smith 1 end r Daggett
Rusk 1 tackle r Faris
James 1 guard )• Cairns
Bigalow center.. .. Mackinnon
Blanchard.. r guard 1 Bentley
Wilson 1 tackle r.., .Chandler
Emerson r end 1 St rout
Hill r half 1 Hoppea
Murphy quarter Berkley
Dole 1 half r Oilman
Burmister ) ~, ~ ,
Fisher \ •• fuU Parker
The second eleven was unusually
weak, not being able to effectively
stop the Varsity at any point.
Hill played in Fisher's place and
made good gains. His play is
stronger than last year and he must
not be overlooked bv those who are
considering the probable Varsity
men. Burmister, who played fora
time last evening, giving way to
Fisher, appears to get better day
by day. He takes advantage oi
the cw-hjng he receives and this
together with the way he goes at a
line will make of him in time a
very clever back. Every night he
receives practice in handling kicks
and is showing improvement in
this line. Rusk at tackle is im
proving every day. He keeps his
opponent from interfering with his
play and is a valuable man with
the ball. Wilson's work is a <-tir
prise to many. With more experi
ence he will develop into a first
class Varsity player. Murphy is
showing up better than in any pre
vious season. He kicked a beauti
ful field goal last evening from the
twenty-yard line. His punting is
almost up to Thanksgiving Day
form. The center trio are not doing
the work that is expected of them.
They do not get into the play
either to help their backs along
when on the offensive or to break
up the interference of the scrubs.
Smith and Barker are playing in
good form. Their work down the
field under kicks is very good.
Emerso* and Faris are making a
strong bid for Varsity honors.
They are both players of the smash
ing kind and show to the best ad
vantage on the defensive.
