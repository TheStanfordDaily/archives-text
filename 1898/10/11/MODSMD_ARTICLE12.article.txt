At the mass-meeting which is to
be held Thur.-'h 1 . y • v.-aing methods
by which the:11 um::i and students
can make their influence most pow
erful in the c aning campaign will
lie the subject i discussion. At
thai tim. we must decide on s<me
definite plan or action and furt lii*r
tala the ntee.-.-arv steps :•> put it
into operation. Perhaps, however.
,i few words as to what may he sug
gested then are appropriate now. so j
that all may be thinking of the;
matter and* formulating further:
it leas or sue..' stions.
In the li r -1 place there are two!
kinds of influence that may 1m ex-j
erted: per* ma 1 influence and or-■
gam zed influence i>y personal in
fluence is m-'-.int such influence as j
each on - might exert were no or-j
ganization to be formed. First may
l»e mentioned the influence with
parents, guardians, relatives and j
friends, and through them with!
many others. A letter home from)
every student in the University ex-j
plaining what we want and how we
hope to get it will start a wave of
intere-t in the subject all over the;
State that will be of incalculable j
benefit our cause. The boys and
girls it college are always of su
preme importance in the home j
circle and what interests them will ;
if communicated be an important)
topic for discussion and considera
tion at hoiue. There is not one of
us but may help the cause much in
this way. Again, many are ac
quaint I with the prominent men
in their neighborhood or county,
perhaps wit i nominee for ek-cti >n
to the Legislature, perhaps with
members of county central com
mittees. pe haps with editors of
newspapers that wield influence.
A private 1 tter to such a man. if it
clearly - ts to-th our p isition, may
mean a vote in our favor in the
te xt Legislature. Those who are
eorresp indents lesr home papers
can do iv muc'.i by judiciously
using their opportunity. Other
mean o: making pers >nal influence
felt \nill no doubt appear if we
search for them. \Y e must seek
them an I rse them effectively.
Uut we ii,' -' t's> form some sort

efforts. "Mr as any plan of oi
ganizati" . has been matured, it has
been one following more or less that
of a political party. There inv.-t

l»" a i.'on;iiiittee resembling a State
central m umittee This c nniniltee
must be practically supreme and
must In* composed only of tin
who are willing to spend time and
! effort i 11 active work. It must he
the originating and controlling force
i in the whole campaign. It also
sterns essential that local clul s
should he organized in the various
jcenter-of population in the State:
j for example, in San Francisco. San
'Jose. Sacramento. Los Angeles.
Fresno, San Luis Ohispo. Santa
'Cruz. Eureka, and other places.
These local clubs could include all
| Stanford people within the district
surrounding the place of organiza
tion. Such clubs will have great
power in creating sentiment in their
districts and can select campaign
committees to work with and under
the direction of the State central
committee or whatever the general
committee may be called. We
ought in this way to be able
to reach every nominee for
election to the next Legislature
personally. It ought to be the duty
of the local committees to see that
every nominee has pressed upon
him the importance of the matter
and its justice and wisdom. In
this way certainly great influence
may be exerted.
No doubt it will be found advis
able to send printed matter to nom
inees, newspapers, and perhaps to
the voters directly. All this can
be managed by the central com
mittee. L'pon that committee must
fall in large measure the burden of
responsibility. Our Stanford Press
Club is already taking steps to see
that the papers of the State are
supplied with suitable matter for
publication setting forth our wants
and desires. Our local political
clubs have promised all the aid
they can give. Every force that is
available must be directed toward
the common goal. If we do that
we may feel confident of succtss.
The people of the State, when once
we have brought the matter to
their attention, are not going to go
on record as opposing an institu
tion of the character of Stanford
; University. They will see the wis
dom of the exemptions which other
States give to such institutions and
! ;is a result Stanford will be able to
| do even more for the State in the
j future than she has already done
, in the past. But the question must
: be brought to the notice of the peo
ple and the points involved made
clear. That it is our business to
do.
