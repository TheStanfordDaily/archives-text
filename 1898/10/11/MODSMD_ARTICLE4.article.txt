						Field Day.

### 
Captain Smith lias announced a
field day for next Saturday.
The object he says is "first for
fun." But seriously he says that
he desires to get track matter to
working early in the year, so that
at the beginning of the next semes
ter he may start in to train the
team with some idea of what ma
terial he has to work upon.
He has purposely withheld an
announcement of the field day, so
that everybody should feel free to
enter. To further the inducement
and call out everybody the field
day will he a handicap affair.
TlfPre will he as many events as
there are entries for events. The
principal object of the Held day is
to get new men upon the track.
Not very many "stars" have en
tered college and in some events
noticeably the quarter mile run,
the team must he made up largely
of men who have never had much
experience in running. The men
to till out other parts the team
must come from the ranks of the
inexperienced also.
Captain Smith says that he hopes
a larger number of men who were
never on the track before will come
out next Saturday. If necessary
he says he will give fifty yards
handicap in the hundred. Noth
ing depends upon the meet to pre
vent anybody from getting out.
