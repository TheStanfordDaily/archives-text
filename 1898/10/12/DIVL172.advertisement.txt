TO NEED GLASSES
is one thing; to be properly fitted is quite
another. We find a difference in the eyes in
about ONE-HALF the cases which come tons
for glasses. This shows the necessity of having
each eye fitted independent of the other. It
you are a wearer of glasses, undoubtedly they
u«ed adjusting—we do this without charge.
CHARGES MODERATE AT,WAV'S.
