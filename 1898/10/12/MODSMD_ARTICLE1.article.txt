Dear Sir: At a meeting of this
Orange held in Tulare, Oct. 3rd,
1898, the following resolution was
adopted unanimously.
Resolved.—The Leland Stanford
Jr. University is, in our judgment,
an educational institution having
a standing with the oldest and best
in the United States. It has been
established, its grounds provided,
its buildings erected, without one
dollar of cost to California. Its
maintenance is of no cost to the
State.
The University of California has
cost the State millions; it is now
costing the state hundreds of thous
ands of dollars per annum for its
maintenance. If the Leland Stan
ford Jr. University asks that the
property on which it is built and
from which it derives its income
be exempt from taxation we believe
equity, justice and the cause of
education require it should be done.
As members of the order of Pa
trons of Husbandry, as farmers,
and as tax-payers, we emphatically
say such exemption from taxation
is eminently proper. California
can not in justice and should not
unjustly tax one educational insti
tution to support the other.
Major C. J. Kerry.
Secretary Tulare Grange.
