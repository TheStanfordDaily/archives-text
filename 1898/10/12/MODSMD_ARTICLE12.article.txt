Tin: Freshmen do not seem to
realize that their intercollegiate
games take place in less than three
weeks. Good football teams can
not be made in a day, nor in a
week, nor can they be made at all
if those who play the game do not
turnout. While it is true that some
of the players are injured, and
therefore unable to be on the field,
that is only the greater reason
why others should be in readiness
to fill the places. We want to see
more freshmen on the football field.
