In another column appears a call
for voices for the Ladies' Glee Club
which is in process of organization.
Visitors and students from the East
seldom fail to remark the lack of
musical activity at Stanford. We
are not entirely inactive, however.
We may have failed to support a
large choral society, hut we have
smaller clubs that are creditable
and that bid fair to be permanent:
the University Glee and Mandolin
Clubs, the Symphony Club, the
Ladies' Mandolin Club, and part of
the time a University Band. If to
this list we might add a ladies'glee
club we could feel that all ligfiter
musical interests were well pro
vided for. Outsiders, join with
those already in the Ladies' Glee
Club in urging all who can to
hand in their names and attend
one try-out. If the Club starts out
with sufficient membership we pre
dict success for it and a kindly re
ception by University circles.
