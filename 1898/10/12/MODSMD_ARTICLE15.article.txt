Both of the college publications
are donating all of their exchanges
to the reading tables of Encina
clubroom; those of a news nature
on one table and the literary ones

another. While there are, as yet,
I comparatively few of the Eastern
! colleges represented, it would be
i well to make a few suggestions as
to caring for them now, before the
privilege of having them is abused.
The editors of the Palo Alto and
of the Sequoia have refrained from
clipping the exchanges, preferring
to laboriously copy such matter as
they may need, in order that the
students can have unmutilated
papers. In the face of this, it is
discouraging to find that some of
the papers have been carved up by
persons who have been benefited bv
the thoughtfulness of those who are
making a sacrifice to give the ex
changes to the college at large. And
another point: it is impossible to
provide covers for all the exchanges,
ior any means of keeping them to
gether. yet a little care on the part
jof the readers themselves would
obviate this deficiency. They could
be kept in order, each series in its
proper place, if those who read
would refrain from "pawing over"
the tables without regard to neat
ness or to the time and trouble of
others. Since the placing of the
exchanges in the Hall is purely
voluntary on the part of the two
papers, there should be some care
taken to show appreciation of the
fact, and enough gratitude on the
part of the students in general, to
make it worth while for thee litors
to continue the custom.
