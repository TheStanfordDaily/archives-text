# Last Night's Practice.
## 
### 
The practice last evening was one
of the liveliest yet seen on the cam
pus this season. Fickert was out
and captained the second eleven,
which held the Varsity down in
good shape. No score was made on
either side. The practice was short
as considerable time had previously
been taken in running down the
field on kicks. Dole and Fisher
made good gains for the Varsity,
while Burmister hammered the
center in his usual style. For the
second Hill, Bidwell, and Emerson
put up the best game. Lougheed,
'00, Steele, '01, and Eaton, '<>2. are
new candidates on the field. Eaton
will play guard and his weight and
experience will strengthen the cen
ter trio. Lougheed will be tried for
quarter; he has had no football
training, but his baseball experi
ence will make him a strong can
didate.
The line-up was as follows:
VARSITY SECOND

Blanchard. â€¢ r guard 1 Fickert
James. . 1 guard r Eaton
Wilson r tackle 1 Cairns
Rusk 1 tackle r. . . . Emerson

After the Varsity practice the
second eleven lined up against a
third team; one touchdown was
made for the second, Nourse falling
on the ball on Rodolph's fumble.!
At present there is a lack of can
didates for quarter while some of
the other positions are over
crowded. The Freshmen have!
been unable to practice on account
of the injuries of several of the
members of the team who played
in Saturday's game. Rice, Carson,
and Geissler are laid off. but will
be out again in a few days.
