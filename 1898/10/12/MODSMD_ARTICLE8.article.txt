# Last Night's Lecture.

The regular Tuesday evening lec
ture was given by Professor Mur
ray, who spoke of "The two titles of
Homer, the martial and the pa
thetic." Much of the time was
spent in reading passages of the
Iliad as translated by the various
poets and scholars, such as Cowper,
who is always readable and alwavs
faithful, but not always Homeric;
Way, the Australian scholar, who
invented a new English metre for
his translation; and Lang, Leaf,
and Myer, three scholars who have
given us a truly admirable transla
tion in prose.
Professor Murray spoke as fol
lows: Homer was a great battle
poet. He also sounded all the
depths of the various human emo
tions. Battle poetry appeals to a
very real side of life, for man is a
lighting animal. We find the best
poetry of this kind in the Iliad;
there is, too, some excellent martial
verse in Scott's poems. The best
things Scott ever wrote were his
j martial passages. They are the
parts which will probably last the
longest. There is in them that
feeling of exhilaration which carries
I you along with them. The battle
scene in Marmion has been called
the most Homeric thing in English
poetry.
Primitive savagery there is in
I the Iliad, and plenty of it. The
Homeric warrior is brave, stalwart,
I and undaunted; he is faithful to
his friend and to his leader; he
j loves his wife and his child; but he
waxes fierce in battle. Were this
the only side shown in the Iliad, it
would still live; but it would not
appeal to us as it does. The Hom
eric warrior glories over his fallen en
emy. and almost invariably throws
1 liack at him some late boast. Hut in
the midst of this grimness, this sav
agery. this contempt for death,
there is always an undercurrent of
; sadness and pathos.
That most famous passage in the
sixth hook of the Iliad, the parting
of Hector and Andromache, full
of power and pathos. It deals also
with the essential facts of human
nature: the wife pleading with her
husband to look after his own safety,
the sad farewell, the father caress
ing his son and praying the gods
to care for him.
If what is savage and terrible is
strongly painted in the I laid, the
pathetic is more strongly pictured.
Homer is great in battle poetry;
but he is greater when he sounds
otherÂ»sides, when lie touches upon
the things that make life worth
living.
