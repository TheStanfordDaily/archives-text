# DOLE ON CAVITE.
## Interesting Items about His Life, Travels, Work, and Fun in the Philippines. 
### 
The following extracts from a let-1
ter written by Alfred K. Dole,
ex-'Ol, from the Philippines, con
tains many interesting facts on the
conditions of life in the Islands:
Cavite, Philippine Islands,
July 14, 1898.
The first sight I got of the city
of Cavite was while foraging for j
wood on our arrival.
The streets are about the width i
of a wide American sidewalk. The
sidewalks are a tight tit for two. j
The houses are mostly stone, two j
stories high, with the second story !
projecting a couple of feet over j
the Hist. The yards have high
stone walls around them with glass
set in the cement on top. The peo
ple are small, the horses are smaller.;
They do not seem to weigh over 250
pounds. I've seen Shetland ponies
larger. The town is on a peninsula,;
connected to the mainland by a â€¢
roadway fifty feet wide.
Our quarters were formerly occu- j
pied by about 300 Spaniards, but j
our whole regiment was crowded
into them. The building is well
ventilated. It has more ventilation
than anything else. Some of the
boys have been in swimming in the
sea just back of our quarters. They
found no end of Spanish ammu
nition, which had been dumped
into the sea. 1 opened some of the
cartridges, which have probably
been in the water since March 1,
and the powder was all dry. One
of the boys also found a revolver.
This place where we are quartered
is a sort of a naval refitting and
supply station.
Tuesday, July 5, I was put on a
detail to go back to the Peking to
get some supplies. We took a meal
with us, but finished our work be
fore noon, ate our grub on the trip
hack to shore, unloaded the boat
imd took a bath, and then got back
in time to have lunch with the
company. A number of the boys
were stung bv a sort of a jelly lisli
while in the water and one of them
had terrible cramps afterward.
The sting seems to be much more
serious than that of the Portuguese
man-of-war, but similar in sensa
tion. The doct >rs have forbidden
iill swimming on that account.
The doctors have forbidden the
sale of fruit inside the gate and as
the boys can't get out, the native*
smuggle it in. I stopped an old
woman with a suspicion looking
bundle under her arm, and while I
examined her bundle, nil her fam
ilv slipped in behind me and pro
ceeded to dispose of their fruit to
the boys who were waiting inside.
Frank Corbusier is sick in the
hospital. I usually stay with him
until "call to quarters."
In the afternoon of July 9th we
had target practice. The targets
were put on some of the sunken
Spanish ships.
On Tuesday morning I applied
fora pass. It was granted, and
Frank, Chet Thomas, and I went
fora walk through Cavite. \\ e
first went and looked in the win
dows of the prison, where the in
surgents kept their Spanish pris

oners. After we had done up the
hospital in the afternoon, we crossed
the neck into the less civilized town
of grass huts on the other side. The
houses are almost identical with the
Hawaiian grass houses, only they
are raised four or five feet and are
thatched differently.
After an early breakfast Wednes
day, July 20, the 3rd Battallion
was crowded into a couple of light
ers and a tug and we crossed-the
bay to Camp Dewey, three or four
; miles out of Manila, to where the
rest of the regiment had preceeded
; us. The tents are about the size of
a large dog kennel and a tight tit
I for two. They would be just the
; thing for small boys. To get
the baggage ashore we had to strip
: and wade out to the lighters which
couldn't come very close to shore.
In the evening we could hear firing
at the point, a mile or two away.
Things are getting a little more in
teresting, but they still go pretty
slow. Alfred R. Dole.
