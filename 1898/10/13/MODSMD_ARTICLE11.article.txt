Coach Cross in his talk to the
team last night spoke again of a
matter that has heen troubling
those who follow intelligently our
progress each year in football —
that is the lack of spirit displayed
by a great number of this year's
players. The absence of dash and
determination in the play this year
lias been deprecated many times
and usually we have been inclined
to assign the blame to the grand
stand. It is true that '"rooting" i>
a good thing. It is good because it
shows the players that the sym
pathy and support of the "rooters"
with them. But after all it is
the men on the gridiron who do the
placing. Often an old football hero
is heard to say that he never hearsj
a single yell and doesn't know that
there is any grandstand while he is
playing. Two things are indispen- j
gible for victory this year. We!
must have a large number of can
didate- for 111<■ team and these can
didates must play the best football

they are capable of all the time.
The tirst of these does not trouble
us much now; there are enough
( men wearing football clothes to
make two good teams. But over
the second the coach and captain
are seriously worried as was shown
in la>t night's meeting. Thanksgiv
ingday is too to near and Berkeley's
team too strong to admit of any
delay or relaxation on our part.
Every man must be in earnest —
get out on time, play hard a nd fast
and all the time. Some of the men
art: playing with spirit, but as a
whole the team has not made a
satisfactory showing.
