Twextv-four entries have been
made for the Carnot preliminaries.
There should have been forty before
the entries closed. Two successive
seasons we have met defeat in ex
temporaneous debates, and it is the
easiest thing possible to assume an
attitude of apathy and let the shin
ing token of superiority go over
to our enemies for the third
time. Those who have entered,
however, are showing a commend
able spirit and no one can
say that Stanford debating inter
ests are declining. The president
and members of the Inter-Soeiety
Debating League have been active in
arranging preliminary debates and
in encouraging debaters. Prepara.
tions for the Freshman-Sophomore
debate are well under way and the
classes have manifested a degree of
.
the old-time rush enthusiasm in
the proposed contest. No one will
deny that it is a wise plan to turn
class enthusiasm into the develop
ment of debating interest. It then
serves a double purpose. Our
opponents are not willing to
lose any of the prestige they
won last year in debating. Re-,
cently they held a Hastings Stu
dents' Congress debate in Stiles'
Hall which was largely and enthus
iastically attended. If we are to
match Berkeley year by year we
must constantly train new men.
In the light of our experience here
there is but one way to do this and
that is through the literary societies.
Very few inter-collegiate debaters
have not beenniembers of one of
them. They are doing good work
and are training men to be ready,
logical speakers. New men will do
well to associate themselves with
one of the other of these societies.

Students in the Art department
can now stand up without fear of
bumping their heads on the cross
beams which were a part of the
"furniture" of their old cramped
quarters. The good ventilatiion,
ample room, ami excellent arrange
ments for light, which the new Art
building affords, make it possible
for the Art department to do more
efficient work, and is a great relief
to all who have been compelled to
stay cooped up for several hour- on
n hot afternoon in that little room
on the second floor of the Engineer
ing building. Mrs. Barron ha> the
gratitude of all Art students as well
a< of every one else connected with
the University for her generous
gift.
