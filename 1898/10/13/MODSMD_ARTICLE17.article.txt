### 
Mrs. Francis E. Spencer, of San
Jose, widow of the late Judge
Spencer, President of the Board of
Trustees, has presented to the Uni
versity Library the law library of
her distinguished husband. This
library will form a valuable acces
sion to the facilities of the Depart
ment of Law in the University.
It contains among other things
complete sets of the United States
Reports and many sets of the in
dividual States. Curiously enough
it contains an extremely valuable
and interesting series of botanical
works on Diatoms, a subject which
interested Judge Spencer very
greatly and occupied to some ex
tent his leisure hours.
