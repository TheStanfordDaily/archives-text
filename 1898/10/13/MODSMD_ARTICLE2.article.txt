# Football Meeting
## 
### 
A meeting of all football candi
dates was held last evening in
room 11. quad. Captain Fisher and
Coach Cross addressed the meeting,
urging the men to get out on the
field more promptly and to play
with more life. The practices for
the last week have been discourag
ing and an appeal was made to .ill
men to get in and do something.
Coach Cross spoke of the manner
of practice at Yale and other East
ern colleges, and showed his inter
est in the success of Stanford's
teams, but he said: "Every one
must do his part; no one can shirk
and remain on the field." It was
decided to appoint Erb, '01 cap
tain of the second eleven for two
weeks and. as far as possible, to
keep the same line-up for each
night's practice. In this way a
stronger second team can be had
and the Varsity will be given better
practice.
Some of the more difficult play
were explained by Coach Cross and
another meeting was appointed for
Friday evening at 7:30.
The training rules for this season
have been signed by the football
j candidates. They are:
(1) To abstain from the use of
j all tobacco and alcoholic liquors.
(2) To retire regularly not later
than 10:80 p.m.
(3) To refrain from eating be
tween meals.
(4) To obey implicitly the com
mands of the coach and captain
while on the field, and to respond
to the call for practice promptly.
Negotiations are now being made
with the proprietors of the Inn re
garding the training table. The
table will be started next week
with a few of the most promising
candidates. Coach Cross says that
new men will be put on as soon as
they show themselves capable, and
that everyone will be given a fair
! trial.
