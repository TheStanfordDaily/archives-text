# A
						SLOW PRACTICE
## Men Late on the Field and Listless in Play. Kansas Volunteers again Tomorrow. 
### 
Last night's practice was slow
and lifeless. The men did not ap
pear on the field until nearly five 1
o'clock and Coach Cross and Cap
tain Fisher were kept waiting for
enough men to make a line
up. A solemn stillness was main
tained by the bleachers, but this
was partially due to the poor
exhibition made by the men on
the field.
Considerable time was spent be
fore the regular practice in training
the men in running down the field
on kicks. Murphy punting. The
men were not only slow in getting
down the field, but tackled poorly,
and frequently the runner carried
the ball past the whole bunch. The
work of Wilson and Husk was an
exception, both drawing applause
I for their hard and sure tackling.
Wilson is fast and never fails to
nail his man. Rusk, though strong
in the line, does not keep his eyes
1 open on the kicks.
The practice was slow and lacked
the usual snap. The players were
slow in taking their positions in the
line and fumbled repeatedly. For
i the Varsity, Fisher, Erb, and Hill
made several good gains through
the line. Fisher was sent across for
a touchdown, the only score made
I during the evening. Hill's line
bucking is strong, but he is at a loss
iii running interference. Murphy
made one long run from the kick
| off, passing the entire second team.
Bidwell and Emerson made good
I gains through the Varsity line, but
were too slow in getting started.
Oilman's work at center was good.
His running i* accurate and he in-
I terferes well.
The line-up was:.

The Kansas Volunteers who gave
lour Varsity the hardest game
played by them this season will
again line up on the campus to
morrow at 8:30 o'clock. Several
changes have been made to im
prove the Kansas team, and a close
name is expected. An opportunity
for comparing the play of the
, Varsity with that of two weeks
; ago will then be presented.
Lieutenant Richy is no longer
jwith the regiment, having resigned
land returned to Kansas to run for
1 a county office.
