men and develop the batting.
Several promising freshmen were
out. Among them,Cowden, catcher
for the Sacramento High School,
and Sheerer, a speedy though wild
pitcher, showed up best. Freeman
promises to keep up his former
good work as an in-field player and
make a reputation with the stick

wonderfully.
Captain Beckett is extremely
anxious to get the new men out
this fall and have them in touch
with the game as soon as possible.
