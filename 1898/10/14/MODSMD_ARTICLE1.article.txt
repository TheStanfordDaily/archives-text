# TAXATION MASS MEETING
## Students and Alumni Formulate Plans for Exemption of University Property From Taxes. 
### 
The student and alumni mass
meeting held in the chapel lant
evening to consider the matter of
exempting Stanford from taxation,
was a decided success, and the
hopes of the alumni who have the
matter in hand were fulfilled.
The meeting was scheduled for
half past seven, and at that time the
chapel was well tilled and those
present were being treated to a vol
ley of yells in the form of " Down
with taxation, down with taxation,
down," and "Give them the axe."
During the evening Dr. Jordan sug
gested a new yell and his sugges
tion was immediately taken up by a
yell, which might he used to good
effect on Thanksgiving day. The
yell was: "Down with the tax, the
tax, the tax, down with the tax, the
tax. the tax, down with the tax,
down with the tux. where? Stan
ford, Stanford, Stanford, Stanford,
There!
Prpcident Schwartz of the Asso
ciated Students called the meeting
to order in a neat speech introduc
ing Charles K. Field as chairman
of the evening.
Mr. Field thanked President
Schwartz for his complimentary
" bouquets," but said he thought
that he had been chosen chairman
of the meeting chiefly because, bv
the grace of heaven and the com
mittee, he was an alumnus. He ex
pressed an abiding faith in the
" Stanford spirit," born in the ath
letic field, and now able to accom
plish whatever it shall undertake.
The life of the University, which
was so nearly put out a few years
ago, is now, he said, assured, but
the greatest crippling influence,
that of taxation, is yet to Vie re
moved. This meeting, he said, was
called for the purpose of organizing,
in order to effectively work for that
end during the present campaign.
" It is mainly the duty of the
alumni, he continued, to take a
leading part in this movement, for
they are now seeking the ' slippery
dollar' in the same channels that
the politicians are hunting votes. "
George E. Crothers, '95, of San
Francisco, began by saying that he
did not know that Mrs. Stanford
had ever wavered in the devotion of
her life to the University, but he
did know that lately, upon assert
ing that she had an armv of Stan
ford alumni and students to fight
her battles, she had been told that
she could not expect aid from any
of them. If the founders were at
this meeting they could have no
doubt as to the loyalty of the re
cipients of their beneficence. " We
are going to tight the battles of the
founders of this institution, he said,
and we need the personal assistance
and enthusiasm of every alumnus
and student. If the State Univer
sity is an example of what enthusi
asm can do, its standard has been
raised from a third rate university
to one that now ranks with the first,
" It is proposed to free the Uni
versity property from taxation, with
certain limitations. Exemption will
not be asked for all property pos

sessed by the University; the two
great ranches in the interior of the
! State, comprising 81,000 acres, are
! not to be included. We shall insist
upon freeing the entire Palo Alto
ranch because a great part of it is
used for University purposes, and
| in future much more of it will be
used in various ways, such as for
! agricultural experimental work.
Mrs. Stanford's San Francisco resi
dence must also be exempted; it
belongs to the University, and will
J eventually be utilized for an art
school, or in some way made much
more valuable to San Francisco
than the taxes now received from
I it.
"Stanford University has added
i more to the value of taxable prop
erty of Santa Clara and San Mateo
counties than the Palo Alto ranch
was worth, by creating a large
town and adding to the population
i of several others. The number of
students here from these two coun
ties vastly more than compensate:-
fora loss of taxes paid by the Uni
versity.
" In addition to the Palo Alto es
tate and San Francisco residence,
all personal property and securities
i held by the University must be ex
empt. Few of the securities held in
the State are taxed, but those owned
by this institution are easily reached
by the assessor.
" It would be possible to remove
the taxes, by a general law, which
would include many other institu
tions; but this law cannot be passed
because of the number of conflict
, ing interests involved. The only
| safe way is by a constitutional
j amendment freeing the University
: by name. This meeting is to organ -
| ize clubs throughout the State;
; to start a movement for ascertaining
the position of every legislative can
didate; to induce everyone inter
ested to influence, if possible, what
ever candidates he may know; and
I to arrange for the distribution of
literature upon the subject. It is
a work largely of correspondence
and should be undertaken by all at
the University and by every
alumnus. The present taxes en
tirely eat up the income from our
great landed estates."
A. C. Whitaker, '99, had been
assigned the part of "arousing en
thusiasm" and he sustained it well.
"We want to lend our enthusiasm
to a just cause; our football men
always give us just cause; and we
now have the justest cause in the
world. Our University is taxed
and taxed to her disadvantage. It
performs purely a public function
and its importance to the State is
incalculable as an educational insti
tution. The members of our fac
ulty give 300 lectures each year in
the line of University extension
work; young men in the prime of
youth come here from the East to
study, and stay and become val
uable citizens; the State is relieved
of making costly additions to the
University of California, which is
now what it is on account of Stan
ford. Before the founding of Stan
ford, there was no famous Univer
sity in California; now there are
two, of which Stanford is the most
famous.
"In nearly all the States and in
Canada it is the policy to freeeverv

public enterprise, not devoted to
money making, from taxation. But
five other States in the Union fol
low the same plan as California.
California could not make one-half
sis good use of the money raised by
taxing this institution as we should
if given to us. The magnificent
gifts to Chicago University and
Cornell were gladly received by
the commonwealths, in which they
arc located and their entire property
was exempted from taxation; Cali
fornia accepts the endowment to
Stanford with a *mile and next day
send* around the Assessor."
Edwin M. Reft, '95, of San
Jose, introduced by the chairman
as late of Harvard, but always of
Stanford, was the next speaker. He
said that it should be our aim to
impress the people of California
that the interests of Stanford are
their interests.
"All of us know and feel," he
stated, "the value of this institu
tion. but we must accomplish our
aim bv logic. We must organize,
concentrate our strength and go to
work. Each one should consider it
a duty to do something toward free
ing ourselves from the burden of
taxation. Our demands will relate
only to the campus and personal
property.
"This question involves a com
parison with the University of Cal
ifornia. We are not rivals of Berke
ley. Both are fighting for the same
purpose. Both are necessary to the
public. Stanford has the advan
tage of being free from the political
machinery of California. If we fail
to win this tight, it will only show
California's greater need for Stan
ford —the need for liberal educa
tion."
Chas. E. Schwartz. '99. the next
speaker, was compelled on account
of hoarseness to cut bis remarks
short. He urged the members of the
student body to co-operate with the
alumni in every possible way to
help along the present movement,
not only through the organized com
mittees but also as individuals
using their personal influence with
politicians and influential friends
throughout the State.
Hugh H. Brown, '96, of San
Francisco, followed by giving some
of the results of an investigation
into the constitution and laws of
other States upon this subject,
which he made soon after the ad
journment of the Legislature a year
and a half ago. Bart of the States
exempt from taxation all property
of public, religious, and educational
institutions; others are not so lib
eral. Nearly every State constitu
tion empowers the Legislature to
enact laws upon the subject. He
read extracts from the constitu
tional provisions of Virginia. Lou
isiana, Indiana, Vermont, Rhode
Island. New Hampshire, Nevada,
Oregon, and Massachusetts, and
quoted the statutes of Deleware and
Indiana. There is but one other
State in the Union, Utah, in which
a constitutional amendment would
be necessary to free an institution
like Stanford from taxation. Mr.
Brown ulso quoted Judge Bradley
of the New York Supreme Court,
setting forth that the spirit of the
constitution in that State is to ex
empt all educational property from

this burden. He closed with the
! prophecy that the next Legislature
will grant our demands.
President Jordan made the last
speech of the evening. He said that
the difference between Utah and
j California is that Utah has two
State Universities, but no Stanford,
and therefore its constitution makes
no difference. According to James
Brice, the constitution of California
is the worst instrument under which
i a civilized people ever did business.
It was constructed in the early
i days before there was any idea of
such public gifts as ours being
made, or different provisions would
i doubtless exist. It is a mass of ill
digested laws, now including eighty
amendments. The only thing to
j do is to ask for a constitutional
; convention at the coming election.
At the time the University was
founded. Senator Stanford thought
it- endowment rich enough to pay
an annual tax of $;100.000 or
1400.000 to the State without in
juring this institution, while at the
same time it would contribute to
the support of Berkeley. Since
then the hard times and our struggle
for existence have redueed the value
of our estate to such an extent that
unless this burden i- removed
the University will be forced to
abandon one of the purposes of its
founders—free tuition, it is im
possible to maintain a university
free from tuition and taxed at the
same time. Our faculty is now
paid about $165,000 a year. A
revenue of $20,000 comes from the
students, while the total income is
$190,000 annually. At present the
products of our great farms do not
more than meet the taxes, which
have amounted to $350,000 within
the last few years. In addition an
other form of taxation that had to
be met was the $800,000 paid for
attorney's fees in the great law suit.
Stanford stands alone in being
the only University that has to pay
taxes. It now faces two alterna
tives; either the removal of this bur
den. or the charging of tuition, such
as Harvard and Yale impose. This
must not be done. It would bar
1 out most of the students who are
! here, for they could not afford to
pay $150 a year. There would be
| no trouble in getting plenty to take
their places, for the world is large
j and contains many rich people, but
the present class of students does
the best work and makes the best
! use of an education.
After the addresses were con
cluded. a business meeting was held
I and a constitution, which was read
by F. V. Keesling, '98, adopted.

I to arrange for the distribution of
literature upon the subject. It is
a work largely of correspondence
and should be undertaken by all at
the University and by every
alumnus. The present taxes en
tirely eat up the income from our
great landed estates."
A. C. Whitaker, '99, had been
assigned the part of "arousing en
thusiasm" and he sustained it well.
"We want to lend our enthusiasm
to a just cause; our football men
always give us just cause; and we
now have the justest cause in the
world. Our University is taxed
and taxed to her disadvantage. It
performs purely a public function
and its importance to the State is
incalculable as an educational insti
tution. The members of our fac
ulty give 300 lectures each year in
the line of University extension
work; young men in the prime of
youth come here from the East to
study, and stay and become val
uable citizens; the State is relieved
of making costly additions to the
University of California, which is
now what it is on account of Stan
ford. Before the founding of Stan
ford, there was no famous Univer
sity in California; now there are
two, of which Stanford is the most
famous.
"In nearly all the States and in
Canada it is the policy to freeeverv

public enterprise, not devoted to
money making, from taxation. But
five other States in the Union fol
low the same plan as California.
California could not make one-half
sis good use of the money raised by
taxing this institution as we should
if given to us. The magnificent
gifts to Chicago University and
Cornell were gladly received by
the commonwealths, in which they
arc located and their entire property
was exempted from taxation; Cali
fornia accepts the endowment to
Stanford with a *mile and next day
send* around the Assessor."
Edwin M. Reft, '95, of San
Jose, introduced by the chairman
as late of Harvard, but always of
Stanford, was the next speaker. He
said that it should be our aim to
impress the people of California
that the interests of Stanford are
their interests.
"All of us know and feel," he
stated, "the value of this institu
tion. but we must accomplish our
aim bv logic. We must organize,
concentrate our strength and go to
work. Each one should consider it
a duty to do something toward free
ing ourselves from the burden of
taxation. Our demands will relate
only to the campus and personal
property.
"This question involves a com
parison with the University of Cal
ifornia. We are not rivals of Berke
ley. Both are fighting for the same
purpose. Both are necessary to the
public. Stanford has the advan
tage of being free from the political
machinery of California. If we fail
to win this tight, it will only show
California's greater need for Stan
ford —the need for liberal educa
tion."
Chas. E. Schwartz. '99. the next
speaker, was compelled on account
of hoarseness to cut bis remarks
short. He urged the members of the
student body to co-operate with the
alumni in every possible way to
help along the present movement,
not only through the organized com
mittees but also as individuals
using their personal influence with
politicians and influential friends
throughout the State.
Hugh H. Brown, '96, of San
Francisco, followed by giving some
of the results of an investigation
into the constitution and laws of
other States upon this subject,
which he made soon after the ad
journment of the Legislature a year
and a half ago. Bart of the States
exempt from taxation all property
of public, religious, and educational
institutions; others are not so lib
eral. Nearly every State constitu
tion empowers the Legislature to
enact laws upon the subject. He
read extracts from the constitu
tional provisions of Virginia. Lou
isiana, Indiana, Vermont, Rhode
Island. New Hampshire, Nevada,
Oregon, and Massachusetts, and
quoted the statutes of Deleware and
Indiana. There is but one other
State in the Union, Utah, in which
a constitutional amendment would
be necessary to free an institution
like Stanford from taxation. Mr.
Brown ulso quoted Judge Bradley
of the New York Supreme Court,
setting forth that the spirit of the
constitution in that State is to ex
empt all educational property from

this burden. He closed with the
! prophecy that the next Legislature
will grant our demands.
President Jordan made the last
speech of the evening. He said that
the difference between Utah and
j California is that Utah has two
State Universities, but no Stanford,
and therefore its constitution makes
no difference. According to James
Brice, the constitution of California
is the worst instrument under which
i a civilized people ever did business.
It was constructed in the early
i days before there was any idea of
such public gifts as ours being
made, or different provisions would
i doubtless exist. It is a mass of ill
digested laws, now including eighty
amendments. The only thing to
j do is to ask for a constitutional
; convention at the coming election.
At the time the University was
founded. Senator Stanford thought
it- endowment rich enough to pay
an annual tax of $;100.000 or
1400.000 to the State without in
juring this institution, while at the
same time it would contribute to
the support of Berkeley. Since
then the hard times and our struggle
for existence have redueed the value
of our estate to such an extent that
unless this burden i- removed
the University will be forced to
abandon one of the purposes of its
founders—free tuition, it is im
possible to maintain a university
free from tuition and taxed at the
same time. Our faculty is now
paid about $165,000 a year. A
revenue of $20,000 comes from the
students, while the total income is
$190,000 annually. At present the
products of our great farms do not
more than meet the taxes, which
have amounted to $350,000 within
the last few years. In addition an
other form of taxation that had to
be met was the $800,000 paid for
attorney's fees in the great law suit.
Stanford stands alone in being
the only University that has to pay
taxes. It now faces two alterna
tives; either the removal of this bur
den. or the charging of tuition, such
as Harvard and Yale impose. This
must not be done. It would bar
1 out most of the students who are
! here, for they could not afford to
pay $150 a year. There would be
| no trouble in getting plenty to take
their places, for the world is large
j and contains many rich people, but
the present class of students does
the best work and makes the best
! use of an education.
After the addresses were con
cluded. a business meeting was held
I and a constitution, which was read
by F. V. Keesling, '98, adopted.
Preamble: Believing that the
taxation of the property of the Le
j land Stanford Junior University
impairs and lessens the usefulness
of the institution and is adverse to
| the best interests of the people of
| California, we, the alumni, stu
1 dents, ex-students, and friends of
the University, do hereby consti
tute ourselves an association and
| pledge ourselves to do all in our
| power to secure such amendment
' to the constitution of California as
shall exempt the University from
i taxation.
I. This organization shall be
called the Stanford Anti-Taxation
jtlub.
11. All alumni, students, and ex
studentsof the University are mem
bers. All friends of the University
may become members by enroll
ment as such.
111. The officers of the club shall
be a president, a secretary-treas
urer, and such other officers as shall
be created by the executive com
mittee. Their duties shall be such
as ordinarily belong to the respec
tive offices.
IV. There shall be an executive
, committee, to consist of the presi
| dent, secretary-treasurer, and seven
[Other members. It shall be the
duty of the executive committee
and it shall have power to do what
ever* in its discretion seems calcu
lated to carry out the object of the
club, and to that end it shall have
power to collect and expend the
monies of the club, to appoint or
remove officers, to till vacancies that
may occur, and to form such local
clubs as may seem necessary.
V. Election of officers and mem
bers of the executive committee
j shall take place at Stanford Uni
versity in September of each year.
| except that the first election shall
take place immediately on the
adoption of this constitution.
VI. This constitution may be
amended by a two-thirds vote of
the members present at any meet
! ing of the club held at Stanford
University.
The election of officers then took
place, resulting in the following
selections:
President, Professor Clarke 1).
Whittier '94; r-ecrcta rv-trea surer,
George E. Crothers, 'Oo; Executive
Committee, J. F. Sheehan. '1)5; Ed
win Rea '90. Frank Adams, '00
0. C Leiter '99, F. V. Keesling, '9S,
and Charles K. Field, '95.
Today J. F. Sheehan Jr. and F.
V. Keesling were chosen to go into
every county in the State in the in
terest of anti-taxation. They will
work on the leading men in the
communities as well as the legisla
tive oandidates.
The student and alumni mass
meeting held in the chapel lant
evening to consider the matter of
exempting Stanford from taxation,
was a decided success, and the
hopes of the alumni who have the
matter in hand were fulfilled.
The meeting was scheduled for
half past seven, and at that time the
chapel was well tilled and those
present were being treated to a vol
ley of yells in the form of " Down
with taxation, down with taxation,
down," and "Give them the axe."
During the evening Dr. Jordan sug
gested a new yell and his sugges
tion was immediately taken up by a
yell, which might he used to good
effect on Thanksgiving day. The
yell was: "Down with the tax, the
tax, the tax, down with the tax, the
tax. the tax, down with the tax,
down with the tux. where? Stan
ford, Stanford, Stanford, Stanford,
There!
Prpcident Schwartz of the Asso
ciated Students called the meeting
to order in a neat speech introduc
ing Charles K. Field as chairman
of the evening.
Mr. Field thanked President
Schwartz for his complimentary
" bouquets," but said he thought
that he had been chosen chairman
of the meeting chiefly because, bv
the grace of heaven and the com
mittee, he was an alumnus. He ex
pressed an abiding faith in the
" Stanford spirit," born in the ath
letic field, and now able to accom
plish whatever it shall undertake.
The life of the University, which
was so nearly put out a few years
ago, is now, he said, assured, but
the greatest crippling influence,
that of taxation, is yet to Vie re
moved. This meeting, he said, was
called for the purpose of organizing,
in order to effectively work for that
end during the present campaign.
" It is mainly the duty of the
alumni, he continued, to take a
leading part in this movement, for
they are now seeking the ' slippery
dollar' in the same channels that
the politicians are hunting votes. "
George E. Crothers, '95, of San
Francisco, began by saying that he
did not know that Mrs. Stanford
had ever wavered in the devotion of
her life to the University, but he
did know that lately, upon assert
ing that she had an armv of Stan
ford alumni and students to fight
her battles, she had been told that
she could not expect aid from any
of them. If the founders were at
this meeting they could have no
doubt as to the loyalty of the re
cipients of their beneficence. " We
are going to tight the battles of the
founders of this institution, he said,
and we need the personal assistance
and enthusiasm of every alumnus
and student. If the State Univer
sity is an example of what enthusi
asm can do, its standard has been
raised from a third rate university
to one that now ranks with the first,
" It is proposed to free the Uni
versity property from taxation, with
certain limitations. Exemption will
not be asked for all property pos

sessed by the University; the two
great ranches in the interior of the
! State, comprising 81,000 acres, are
! not to be included. We shall insist
upon freeing the entire Palo Alto
ranch because a great part of it is
used for University purposes, and
| in future much more of it will be
used in various ways, such as for
! agricultural experimental work.
Mrs. Stanford's San Francisco resi
dence must also be exempted; it
belongs to the University, and will
J eventually be utilized for an art
school, or in some way made much
more valuable to San Francisco
than the taxes now received from
I it.
"Stanford University has added
i more to the value of taxable prop
erty of Santa Clara and San Mateo
counties than the Palo Alto ranch
was worth, by creating a large
town and adding to the population
i of several others. The number of
students here from these two coun
ties vastly more than compensate:-
fora loss of taxes paid by the Uni
versity.
" In addition to the Palo Alto es
tate and San Francisco residence,
all personal property and securities
i held by the University must be ex
empt. Few of the securities held in
the State are taxed, but those owned
by this institution are easily reached
by the assessor.
" It would be possible to remove
the taxes, by a general law, which
would include many other institu
tions; but this law cannot be passed
because of the number of conflict
, ing interests involved. The only
| safe way is by a constitutional
j amendment freeing the University
: by name. This meeting is to organ -
| ize clubs throughout the State;
; to start a movement for ascertaining
the position of every legislative can
didate; to induce everyone inter
ested to influence, if possible, what
ever candidates he may know; and
I to arrange for the distribution of
literature upon the subject. It is
a work largely of correspondence
and should be undertaken by all at
the University and by every
alumnus. The present taxes en
tirely eat up the income from our
great landed estates."

tage of being free from the political
machinery of California. If we fail
to win this tight, it will only show
California's greater need for Stan
ford —the need for liberal educa
tion."
Chas. E. Schwartz. '99. the next
speaker, was compelled on account
of hoarseness to cut bis remarks
short. He urged the members of the
student body to co-operate with the
alumni in every possible way to
help along the present movement,
not only through the organized com
mittees but also as individuals
using their personal influence with
politicians and influential friends
throughout the State.
Hugh H. Brown, '96, of San
Francisco, followed by giving some
of the results of an investigation
into the constitution and laws of
other States upon this subject,
which he made soon after the ad
journment of the Legislature a year
and a half ago. Bart of the States
exempt from taxation all property
of public, religious, and educational
institutions; others are not so lib
eral. Nearly every State constitu
tion empowers the Legislature to
enact laws upon the subject. He
read extracts from the constitu
tional provisions of Virginia. Lou
isiana, Indiana, Vermont, Rhode
Island. New Hampshire, Nevada,
Oregon, and Massachusetts, and
quoted the statutes of Deleware and
Indiana. There is but one other
State in the Union, Utah, in which
a constitutional amendment would
be necessary to free an institution
like Stanford from taxation. Mr.
Brown ulso quoted Judge Bradley
of the New York Supreme Court,
setting forth that the spirit of the
constitution in that State is to ex
empt all educational property from

this burden. He closed with the
! prophecy that the next Legislature
will grant our demands.
President Jordan made the last
speech of the evening. He said that
the difference between Utah and
j California is that Utah has two
State Universities, but no Stanford,
and therefore its constitution makes
no difference. According to James
Brice, the constitution of California
is the worst instrument under which
i a civilized people ever did business.
It was constructed in the early
i days before there was any idea of
such public gifts as ours being
made, or different provisions would
i doubtless exist. It is a mass of ill
digested laws, now including eighty
amendments. The only thing to
j do is to ask for a constitutional
; convention at the coming election.
At the time the University was
founded. Senator Stanford thought
it- endowment rich enough to pay
an annual tax of $;100.000 or
1400.000 to the State without in
juring this institution, while at the
same time it would contribute to
the support of Berkeley. Since
then the hard times and our struggle
for existence have redueed the value
of our estate to such an extent that
unless this burden i- removed
the University will be forced to
abandon one of the purposes of its
founders—free tuition, it is im
possible to maintain a university
free from tuition and taxed at the
same time. Our faculty is now
paid about $165,000 a year. A
revenue of $20,000 comes from the
students, while the total income is
$190,000 annually. At present the
products of our great farms do not
more than meet the taxes, which
have amounted to $350,000 within
the last few years. In addition an
other form of taxation that had to
be met was the $800,000 paid for
attorney's fees in the great law suit.
Stanford stands alone in being
the only University that has to pay
taxes. It now faces two alterna
tives; either the removal of this bur
den. or the charging of tuition, such
as Harvard and Yale impose. This
must not be done. It would bar
1 out most of the students who are
! here, for they could not afford to
pay $150 a year. There would be
| no trouble in getting plenty to take
their places, for the world is large
j and contains many rich people, but
the present class of students does
the best work and makes the best
! use of an education.
After the addresses were con
cluded. a business meeting was held
I and a constitution, which was read
by F. V. Keesling, '98, adopted.
Preamble: Believing that the
taxation of the property of the Le
j land Stanford Junior University
impairs and lessens the usefulness
of the institution and is adverse to
| the best interests of the people of
| California, we, the alumni, stu
1 dents, ex-students, and friends of
the University, do hereby consti
tute ourselves an association and
| pledge ourselves to do all in our
| power to secure such amendment
' to the constitution of California as
shall exempt the University from
i taxation.
I. This organization shall be
called the Stanford Anti-Taxation
jtlub.
11. All alumni, students, and ex
studentsof the University are mem
bers. All friends of the University
may become members by enroll
ment as such.
111. The officers of the club shall
be a president, a secretary-treas
urer, and such other officers as shall
be created by the executive com
mittee. Their duties shall be such
as ordinarily belong to the respec
tive offices.
IV. There shall be an executive
, committee, to consist of the presi
| dent, secretary-treasurer, and seven
[Other members. It shall be the
duty of the executive committee
and it shall have power to do what
ever* in its discretion seems calcu
lated to carry out the object of the
club, and to that end it shall have
power to collect and expend the
monies of the club, to appoint or
remove officers, to till vacancies that
may occur, and to form such local
clubs as may seem necessary.
V. Election of officers and mem
bers of the executive committee
j shall take place at Stanford Uni
versity in September of each year.
| except that the first election shall
take place immediately on the
adoption of this constitution.
VI. This constitution may be
amended by a two-thirds vote of
the members present at any meet
! ing of the club held at Stanford
University.
The election of officers then took
place, resulting in the following
selections:
President, Professor Clarke 1).
Whittier '94; r-ecrcta rv-trea surer,
George E. Crothers, 'Oo; Executive
Committee, J. F. Sheehan. '1)5; Ed
win Rea '90. Frank Adams, '00
0. C Leiter '99, F. V. Keesling, '9S,
and Charles K. Field, '95.
Today J. F. Sheehan Jr. and F.
V. Keesling were chosen to go into
every county in the State in the in
terest of anti-taxation. They will
work on the leading men in the
communities as well as the legisla
tive oandidates.
The student and alumni mass
meeting held in the chapel lant
evening to consider the matter of
exempting Stanford from taxation,
was a decided success, and the
hopes of the alumni who have the
matter in hand were fulfilled.
The meeting was scheduled for
half past seven, and at that time the
chapel was well tilled and those
present were being treated to a vol
ley of yells in the form of " Down
with taxation, down with taxation,
down," and "Give them the axe."
During the evening Dr. Jordan sug
gested a new yell and his sugges
tion was immediately taken up by a
yell, which might he used to good
effect on Thanksgiving day. The
yell was: "Down with the tax, the
tax, the tax, down with the tax, the
tax. the tax, down with the tax,
down with the tux. where? Stan
ford, Stanford, Stanford, Stanford,
There!
Prpcident Schwartz of the Asso
ciated Students called the meeting
to order in a neat speech introduc
ing Charles K. Field as chairman
of the evening.
Mr. Field thanked President
Schwartz for his complimentary
" bouquets," but said he thought
that he had been chosen chairman
of the meeting chiefly because, bv
the grace of heaven and the com
mittee, he was an alumnus. He ex
pressed an abiding faith in the
" Stanford spirit," born in the ath
letic field, and now able to accom
plish whatever it shall undertake.
The life of the University, which
was so nearly put out a few years
ago, is now, he said, assured, but
the greatest crippling influence,
that of taxation, is yet to Vie re
moved. This meeting, he said, was
called for the purpose of organizing,
in order to effectively work for that
end during the present campaign.
" It is mainly the duty of the
alumni, he continued, to take a
leading part in this movement, for
they are now seeking the ' slippery
dollar' in the same channels that
the politicians are hunting votes. "
George E. Crothers, '95, of San
Francisco, began by saying that he
did not know that Mrs. Stanford
had ever wavered in the devotion of
her life to the University, but he
did know that lately, upon assert
ing that she had an armv of Stan
ford alumni and students to fight
her battles, she had been told that
she could not expect aid from any
of them. If the founders were at
this meeting they could have no
doubt as to the loyalty of the re
cipients of their beneficence. " We
are going to tight the battles of the
founders of this institution, he said,
and we need the personal assistance
and enthusiasm of every alumnus
and student. If the State Univer
sity is an example of what enthusi
asm can do, its standard has been
raised from a third rate university
to one that now ranks with the first,
" It is proposed to free the Uni
versity property from taxation, with
certain limitations. Exemption will
not be asked for all property pos

sessed by the University; the two
great ranches in the interior of the
! State, comprising 81,000 acres, are
! not to be included. We shall insist
upon freeing the entire Palo Alto
ranch because a great part of it is
used for University purposes, and
| in future much more of it will be
used in various ways, such as for
! agricultural experimental work.
Mrs. Stanford's San Francisco resi
dence must also be exempted; it
belongs to the University, and will
J eventually be utilized for an art
school, or in some way made much
more valuable to San Francisco
than the taxes now received from
I it.
"Stanford University has added
i more to the value of taxable prop
erty of Santa Clara and San Mateo
counties than the Palo Alto ranch
was worth, by creating a large
town and adding to the population
i of several others. The number of
students here from these two coun
ties vastly more than compensate:-
fora loss of taxes paid by the Uni
versity.
" In addition to the Palo Alto es
tate and San Francisco residence,
all personal property and securities
i held by the University must be ex
empt. Few of the securities held in
the State are taxed, but those owned
by this institution are easily reached
by the assessor.
" It would be possible to remove
the taxes, by a general law, which
would include many other institu
tions; but this law cannot be passed
because of the number of conflict
, ing interests involved. The only
| safe way is by a constitutional
j amendment freeing the University
: by name. This meeting is to organ -
| ize clubs throughout the State;
; to start a movement for ascertaining
the position of every legislative can
didate; to induce everyone inter
ested to influence, if possible, what
ever candidates he may know; and
I to arrange for the distribution of
literature upon the subject. It is
a work largely of correspondence
and should be undertaken by all at
the University and by every
alumnus. The present taxes en
tirely eat up the income from our
great landed estates."
A. C. Whitaker, '99, had been
assigned the part of "arousing en
thusiasm" and he sustained it well.
"We want to lend our enthusiasm
to a just cause; our football men
always give us just cause; and we
now have the justest cause in the
world. Our University is taxed
and taxed to her disadvantage. It
performs purely a public function
and its importance to the State is
incalculable as an educational insti
tution. The members of our fac
ulty give 300 lectures each year in
the line of University extension
work; young men in the prime of
youth come here from the East to
study, and stay and become val
uable citizens; the State is relieved
of making costly additions to the
University of California, which is
now what it is on account of Stan
ford. Before the founding of Stan
ford, there was no famous Univer
sity in California; now there are
two, of which Stanford is the most
famous.
"In nearly all the States and in
Canada it is the policy to freeeverv

public enterprise, not devoted to
money making, from taxation. But
five other States in the Union fol
low the same plan as California.
California could not make one-half
sis good use of the money raised by
taxing this institution as we should
if given to us. The magnificent
gifts to Chicago University and
Cornell were gladly received by
the commonwealths, in which they
arc located and their entire property
was exempted from taxation; Cali
fornia accepts the endowment to
Stanford with a *mile and next day
send* around the Assessor."
Edwin M. Reft, '95, of San
Jose, introduced by the chairman
as late of Harvard, but always of
Stanford, was the next speaker. He
said that it should be our aim to
impress the people of California
that the interests of Stanford are
their interests.
"All of us know and feel," he
stated, "the value of this institu
tion. but we must accomplish our
aim bv logic. We must organize,
concentrate our strength and go to
work. Each one should consider it
a duty to do something toward free
ing ourselves from the burden of
taxation. Our demands will relate
only to the campus and personal
property.
"This question involves a com
parison with the University of Cal
ifornia. We are not rivals of Berke
ley. Both are fighting for the same
purpose. Both are necessary to the
public. Stanford has the advan
tage of being free from the political
machinery of California. If we fail
to win this tight, it will only show
California's greater need for Stan
ford —the need for liberal educa
tion."
