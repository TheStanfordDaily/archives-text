Now that an organization has
been effected and plans formulated
for the fight against taxation we,
the students of Stanford University
will have the opportunity of our
lives to show how deep is our grat
itude for the benefits which we are
daily receiving. It rests with us in
great measure, whether or not this
movement shall be immediately
successful. That which has already
been accomplished in starting the
movement and planning the cam
paign, has been done by the alumni.
We have done no more than to
smile approval and talk of what a
fine thing university immunity
would be. We are needed now and
if we work together and work per
sistently, the sum total of our in
fluenc.* will be great enough to win
the dav and free our Alma Mater
from an unjust burden in taxes
which impairs her usefulness along
every line. The l>est way that we
can begin, is to exercise our
personal influence. By writ
ing to our acquaintances who
are in politics and explaining tke
folly and injustice of the State's ac
tion in imposing these taxes, we
can do something that will directly
influence legislators. If we enlist
friend;* in our cause and have them
work the wires for us, we are mak
ing our influence felt just as effec
tively, even if indirectly. Our
cause is *?uch that if we were disin
terested parties instead of being
directly concerned, the justice of
the demands for immunity should
be sutlicient to interest us in the
Movement and enthuse us enough
to d<> this work that right might
triumph. Beinjrdirectly interested
to the degree that we are. there
should be no limit to our effort- to
ace<implish our ent 1.
The fault, we believe, is not with
the people of California who are as
broad minded and grateful as the
people of other States. 1 lie trouble
is in the constitution, which was

adopted to tit other conditions than
! now exist. Qui work then is to
make th<* people of California'un
derstand our position and the
justice of our cause. This done
and tiit- fight is won.
