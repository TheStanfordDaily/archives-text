# Last Night's Practice.
## 
### 
The practice last night was an
improvement on the previous prac
tices of the week. The men came
out more promptly and played with
greater snap than usual. Fickert
was out and assisted in coaching
the Varsity, while Erb had charge
of the second eleven. Three touch
downs were made by the Varsity,
two by Murphy and one by Parker
in ;i pretty end run entirely un
assisted. The men on the* second
could not keep their eyes upon the
runners in a scattered held. Mur
phy, Parker, and Dole made sev
eral long runs without interference,
and no one was near to bring them
down. Emerson did good work on
the second. He is a hard, consis
tent player and will soon develop
into a Varsity man. He has little
speed but uses it to advantage and
gets into every play. Erb at
quarter was an improvement, and
not a fumble was made throughout
the practice.
