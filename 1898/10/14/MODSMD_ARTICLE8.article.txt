# KANSAS AGAIN DEFEATED
## Varsity Plays a Bagged Game, but Wins From the Soldiers 15 to 11 
### 
The gar. between the Kansas
Volunteer- and the Varsity occu
pied nr.)iv than an liour and a half.
The halve- were twenty-five min
ute* in length and with the usual
allowance for injuries and an un
usual allowance for kicks, the
gann ran on until dusk, when time
was called with the score 15 to 11
in favor of the Varsity.
On the whole the game was rag
ged. The soldiers stuck exclusively
to their massive guards-back play
for all of their gains, while the var
sity was content with the fierce
plunges of Fisher, and the quick
dashes of Dole. There was no team
work whatever in the first half; the
line was a sieve through which the
army men poured upon the slowly,
moving backs.
The aggresive work was better
than the score would show. . The
heavy guard formation headed by
the experienced Foster was often
tumbled over, more particularly
after Fisher took to shifting from
his regular position in order to back
up the attacked point.
The line-men. and especially the
center-trio played too high. James
put up the steadiest game of the
three, though he still uses his
hand:- too much. Bigelow put up
the poorest exhibition which has
been given by a Stanford center
foi years. He was so slow that his
opponent always got the jump on
him ar.d he was trifled with en
tirely t>><> much. Bigelow lack-the
ability to siz.e up quickly the place
of the play and is slow in getting
there, one of the prime essentials in
good center play. Blanchard has
the making of a good guard but like
hi- companions has not learned the
necessity of getting low in blocking
and tackling as well as in defensive
play.
"W ilfon played a good. bard, and
consistent game throughout. He
keep- his head well and is always
near the ball. Fora new man
Emerson on the other side of the line
shower up well against his heavier
I opponent. Several times he broke
through and downed the runner
! behind the line.
Parker too was sure and steady,
and played hi- usual consistent
game. MeFadden on the other end
was slow, and though he made sev
eral pretty tackles, committed the
greatest fault of an end —being
drawn in—an error by which tin
second touchdown of the soldiers
was made.
Behind the line Becklev suc
ceeded Erb at quarter and though
he has had hut little experience on
the Varsity, stopped much of the
looseness and unfortunate fumbling
which occurred during the early
part of the game. Hill plavod a
hard game, but is too slow. He
doesn't show the desire to plunge
into the play that Fisher does.-,and
sometime- turns when goiilg \j\Vo
! the lint
Dole at half is a hard lighter and
a strong and sure ground-gainer on
the offensive, but still does not show
1 an equal ability in defensive work.
Fisher's was the most prominent
individual game i>n the lield. Both
in ground gaining and backing up
the line he showed upas well as he
ever did at hi- best last season."
Erb and Dole were retired.
Erb from an injury to the knee and
1 )ole on account of either a sprained
ankle or some broken bones in his
foot, exactly what the injurv i- has
! not been ascertained.
The came showed that our see

ond team is too weak to give the
Varsity proper opposition. We
must have more enthusiasm in the
players and on the bleachers. It is
high time for football at Stanford
to brace up.
