Thk <iift 1»y Mrs. Spencer of the
!it\v library nt the late Judge Fran
cis E. Spencer «»f San Jose, is a
valuable acquisition to the Univer
sity, especially as the collection of
books goes to the Law department,
which is in sore need of such hooks
as Judge Spencer's library contains.
Mr.-. Spencer has earned the grati
tude of the whole student body by
her generosity. The law students
will meet tomorrow to take action
in connection with the gift.
