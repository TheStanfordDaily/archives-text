# W.A.A. "Frolic."

The unique invitation sent out
by the Women's Athletic Associa
tion to the women of the University
brought between three and four
hundred indies to Rohle gynma
sium on Saturday evening. Though
the guests came attired in sheets
and pillow-cases the costumes were
varied; there were (.Â»reeks and Ca
puchins, sunbonneted maidens and
Sisters of Charity, and a number
of black masks, and grinning skulls
under snowy caps.
This was the ghostly audience to
which the " Mouse Trap," a farce
adapted from the French by Mrs.
Burton Harrison, was given.
The part of Mortimer Briefbags,
the knightly hero, was well sus
tained by Miss Elizabeth Lewis, '99,
and .that of the heroine, Mrs. Le
titia Prettipet, was charmingly
taken by Miss Annabelle Zucker, '01.
After the fun of the absurd situa
tion of the farce was over the masks
were thrown back and music and
dancing occupied the remainder of
the evening, during which refresh
ments were served in the galleries.
The committee to which much of
the credit of the enjoyable evening
was due were the following: Miss
Rose (chairman), and Miss Eliza
beth Lewis, '99; Katharine Adams,
'99, Ada Heineman, '01, Maryline
Barnard, '01.
It is some years since the W. A.
A. have given a reception of any
kind. The success of this year's
venture is sufficient to warrant the
hope that such a reception to
women will be an annual occurence.
