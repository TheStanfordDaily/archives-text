# Track Tryout.
## 
### 
On Saturday afternoon a number
of men got «»\it on the track and an j
impromptu field day was run
through.
Til*' weights, hurdles, and pole
vault, were dispensed with a> also
was the half mile run and the two
twenty dash, it being felt that one
sprint and one distanee run were
sufficient for the men in the present
state of training.
The tirst events were the 100-
yard trials. Owing to the fact that
the men have not had time to train
for hard work, the finals of the
dash were not run. The men who
showed up most promisingly were
Stewart. '01. who developed at the
very end of last year and is likely
to prove fast thi> year, Frail, an
Iowa man with .-ome experience,
and ('hadbourne, a freshman who
is trying for the middle distance
runs but did well on Saturday in
his heat in the hundred. Several
other new men showed by their
running that they are likely to
develop, but were prevented by
want <<r training and a poor track
from doing themselves justice.
In tlie half-mile walk both Jones
land Wilson, the two new men in
the race showed up well. Lousley
set the pace and apparently is in
good form now.
In the quarter mile run St rout
and ( 'hadbourne left the rest of the
bunch and ran a very hard and
close race bv themselves. St rout
barely winning ;it the very tape.
The time was under 5S seconds ac
cording to a bystander's watch.
Captain Smith set a slow pace in
the mile run and in a rather fast
sprint at the finish Morris. '01.
broke the tape. Several other men
showed up encouragingly in this
event.
Nearly everybody contested the
two jumps and although no records
were broken there was keen rivalry,
Diggles finally winning one and
Simons the other.
Captain Smith announced a more
serious meet in about two weeks,
when both the men and the track
| will be in better shape and the com
plete number of events will be run
through.
