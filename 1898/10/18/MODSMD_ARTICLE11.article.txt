Evwty student who receives a
postal card from the Anti-Taxation
Committee requesting his or her
presence at a meeting tomorrow
afternoon should attend such meet
ing without fail. The committee
has something very important to
communicate to each student who
is called and a full attendance at
these meetings is absolutely essen
tial to the success of the movement
to free our University from taxa
tion. The committee wishes to let
each one know what he or she can
do individually and they will pre
sent it to them in such shape as to
enable the work to be do no in a
thoroughly effective manner. Pro
fessor Branner. acting president of
the University in the absence of
President Jordan, has recom
mended that each instructor who
holds classes at a time that would
conflict with these meetings excuse
the students who have received a
cartl from the committee, and there
is no doubt bjut this will be ar
ranged satisfactorily. Fora final
word, no more important duty has
presented itself to each student than
to attend these meetings and as we
so often say, Stanford expects every
one to do his duty.
