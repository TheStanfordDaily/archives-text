The opportunity now presented
to the students of Law and Mining
Engineering in particular to fam
iliarize themselves with the prin
ciples of mining law which is of
such vital importance in these
Western States, is not, we think,
fully appreciated by the students in
these departments. Judge Lindley's
great knowledge of mining law and
its practical application makes tin 1
course an invaluable one, second, in
fact, to none in the country. That
students who intend to settle west
of the Mississippi should under
stand this great branch of law is
very important to their success.
For instance, in California, there is
not one county in the State where a
question of mines is not apt to come
up for settlement at anv time. Not
only lawyers and mining engineers
will be concerned with this subject
hereafter, but business men will
find themselves directly interested.
The West gave birth to the min
ing laws and as a matter of histor
ical knowledge they d« serve more at
tention than they have received. The

luck of information which prevails
everywhere on this subject has in
duced Judge Lindlev to take the
matter in hand here and give the
students the benefit of years of
study arid it search. Considering
t! e importance of the subject and
il.e prominent e of the lecturer, this
course should receive even more at
tention than it lias. The student
body, too, should realize the sacrifice
in time and energy that Judge
L'ndley is making that the Stan
ford graduates may be prepared to
intelligently deal with mining
questions.
