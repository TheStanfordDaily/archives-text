As a class something is wrong
with the freshmen. This idea has
now become generally accepted with
almost every one except the mem
bers of the Freshman Class. The
great trouble is that the class does
not realize its own shortcomings or
it would certainly show more spirit.
The most important business they,
as a class, have on their hands now
is the production of a football team.
The most conspicuous event of the
freshman year is the annual foot
ball game between the new men of
Stanford and the University of Cal
ifornia. Usually at this time of
the year, all that a freshman can
concentrate his mind upon is the
strength of his class team and the
ability of its players, but the fresh
nan this year is less interested ap
parently than any man in college
in the approaching contest. The
basis of the fault is not in the qual
ity of the men who are in the class
but their attitude and disposition.
They do not attend their class
meetings and when a quorum is
finally obtained they waste time in
foolish discussion and points of
order â€”all very interesting and good
for sharpening wit but not con
ducive to the transaction of busi
ness or to the development of a
serious class pride. The class is
not in earnest over its own affairs
or those of the University. Usually
the upperclassman finds a fresh
man too eager to make his presence
felt. The normal freshman be
lieves that his team could score
against the Varsity. This kind of
man can be restrained, curbed, and
developed, but as yet Stanford up
perclassmen don't know how to deal
with a freshman who doesn't know
the m?mes of the players on his
team, who doesn't know when a
meeting of his class is called, who
doesn't even give his class yell often
enough st> that one man in ten in
the University knows what it
sounds like.
