## 
### 
The following article in regard to
the "Live" House to he erected at
the University of Pennsylvania is
taken from the Pennsylranian:
"The new "live" house, which
is soon to be erected by the Biologi
cal department, is to he about (>2
feet long and «>2 feet wide. On the
ground floor there will be a long
aquarium room, with three pools
on one side and extensive animal
rooms on the other. The largest
pool, located in the centre, will be a
fresh-water basin, divided into nine
principal sections. These sections
will contain frogs, reptiles, and a
great many species of fresh water
fishes and invertibrates. The re
maining two pools are to be of
fresh and salt-water respectively,
each divived into numerous sec
tions, the salt-water basin to contain
small sharks, skates, sea urchins,
starfish, anemonies and other ma
rine invertibrates.
"Specimens of nearly all the
families of the smaller mammals,
such as rats, mice, squirrels, rab
bits, and opossums, will hi; kept on
the other side of the aquarium.
Their houses will be so constructed
that it will be possible to investi
gate and determine their daily and
nocturnal habits.
"►Special attention will be given
to bees, the hives being arranged in
a long row upstairs. Certain bees
will l»e marked, so that their weight
can be determined before they
leave the building and after their
return. Ants, moths, wasps, and
other insects will be kept for study.
"Another interesting part of this
live house is a large wing which
will be devoted to many varieties of
birds, such as the owl, the spar
row, the goldfinch; bats will also
be kept in this portion of the build
ng.
'ilt is the purpose of the Biolog
ical department to collect this val
uable material for the use of stu
dents in research work, for the dif
ferent classes, and for experimental
work, the desire being t<> introduce
the study <>112 living creatures in
schools and universities, instead of
dead ones, as is the custom now.
[This vivarium is the first of its
kind in this country, and so far as
known no university in the wprld
is provided with such a building.
It should furnish a great stimulus
to zoological work in our university
and communitv."
