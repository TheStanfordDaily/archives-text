# Last Night's Practice.
## 
### 
Xo regular line up was made last
evening on account of the many
Varsity players who are laid oft"
with injuries. Practice had been
called for the Freshman team at
4 o'clock, hut as barely more than
enough for one team were on the
field they were able to go through
light signal practice only. Rice,
captain of the '02 team was out for
the first time since his injury in the
game with Lowell High School, and
succeeded in putting more spirit into
the play, the lack of which has been
the cause of the numerous freshmen
defeats. (Jeissler was out and prac
ticed punting. He punts hard and
places his kicks well, but is very
slow in gathering in the ball on a
return, frequently allowing it to go
over his head. Coach Cross, Cap
tain Fisher, and several Varsity
players have agreed to assist the
team in coaching, if enough men to
form two teiuns come on the field
every night at 4 p.m.
After the Freshman practice, the
Varsity line was formed and prac
tice given in breaking through.
Oilman's work at center on the sec
ond was the best exhibition in this
line, Oilman is strong and speedy
and will make a hard tight for his
position. James and Blanchard
were changed in their positions, the
former being moved to right guard
and the latter to the left vide of
center. James showed up well
under the change, but lUanchard
was unable to become accustomed
to his new position. Murphy's
punting t was the only redeeming
feature of the practice last night.
Many of his kicks covered over fifty
yards.
