# COACH CROSS INTERVIEWED.
## The
						Men Who will be Put on the Training Table Tomorrow. The Football Situation. 
### 
Coach Cross was interviewed to
day regarding the team. He said:
" J am not at all satisfied with the
work of the men up to date. They
are not willing, unlike the men
coached here in 1890. The work of
the Varsity in the game with the
soldiers was a deplorably weak ex
hibition of football. The line men
were particularly weak both on
offensive and defensive work. The
line, at present with the exception
of the ends, is very weak, and it is
to them the bulk of work for the
next two months will be given. The
ends are the strong points of the
line and they are playing a fine
game.
"Back of the line the men are
more experienced in the game and
show to better advantage when.com
pared with the line men. They are
somewhat disorganized just now on
account of the injuries of Burmister
and Dole.
"The whole team, however, is
not as far advanced in general team
work as they ought to be at this
time in the season."
He was asked to say something
about the Freshman team and he
said:
"I have never seen so little spirit
displayed by a class in Stanford
and L have seen five classes here.
Although Captain Fisher and my
self are out on the field three quar
ters of an hour before Varsity prac
tice, willing and anxious to coach
these freshmen, they do not meet us
half way and have enough men on
the field to fill out a second eleven.
Now 1 wish the freshmen would get
together and have two elevens on
the field each evening promptly at
a quarter to four, so that they can
get in a good half-hour's work be
fore Varsity practice.
Unless they do get out and work
like beavers for the next two weeks
they will be unmercifully beaten by
the Berkeley Freshman eleven a
week from next Saturday."
The training table starts tomor
row morning at the Inn. Breakfast
will be served at 7:30. The follow
ing men are to go on the
table at once: Captain Fisher,
Blanchard, Biglow, James, Parker,
Rea Smith, Murphy, Gilman, Mac
kinnon, Erb, McFadden, Hill, Em
erson, Cairns, and Faris. Rusk,
Wilson, and Burmister have been
given permission by Coach Cross to
remain at their present hoard
ing places fora short time.
The meals are under the direc
tion of Trainer McLeod. In the
morning for breakfast the men will
have oatmeal, chops, eggs, beef
steaks, fruit., coffee, dry toast and
oatmeal water. Luncheon will be
served from 12:15 to 1:30 and will
consist of light soup, cold meats,
chops, dry toast, baked potatoes
and oatmeal water. The men will
have soup, roast beef, vegetables,
dry toast, oatmeal water and a
light desert for dinner. It will be
served from (> to 7:30.
As the men on the field show by
their work that they are deserving
to go on the training table they
will be put there. Before the end

of the week there will !><> two full
elevens :it the Inn and more will

"Jaek" Mice. '1)7. who is on the
campus recovering from the in
juries he received at the powder
works explosion last summer, will
he a guest <>112 Mr. Cross at the train
ing ta 1 tie. Mr. Cross hopes to have
most of his meals with the football
men.
Trainer McLeod when asked to
day about the injured football men,,
said: "They are getting along very
well" with the exception of Dole
whose injury seems to he more
serious than we first anticipated,
liurmister's side is strong again
and he will be out today or tomor
row. Wilson who injured a large
muscle in his side is improving
nicely and will he out playing by
the end of the week. Erb strained
a large tendon in the side of his leg,,
and will he kept from playing for
a week. Smith has gone stale. He
will soon he back in his old form.
Several of the other men have
slight injuries but these will not
keep them off the field.
