# Memorial Gateway at Columbia.
## 
### 
Columbia University has decided
to erect a memorial gate in honor of
the Columbia men who served in
the late war. The gate will cost
about $5,000, $250 of which Presi
dent Low has contributed. Fifteen
hundred dollars has already been
raised. The gate is not only a me
morial to the men who died in the
war, but to all Columbia men who
went to the front. The plan is en
dorsed by President McKinley.
