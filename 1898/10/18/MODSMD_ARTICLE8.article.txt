# New College Songs.
## 
### 
The committee, composed of Cant
well, Oilman, anil Arnold (chair
man), appointed by the Executive
Committee of the student body to
look after the new song-hook, invites
all University students to hand in
new college songs or revisions of
the old ones. Most of the old songs
contain names of students, who are
no longer in the University. These
must he revised and new names
submitted for the old ones. The
new songs and revisions should be
handed to some member of the
committee immediately so that the
song-book may be published soon.
The Executive Committee has
decided not to offer the usual $10
prize this year for the best college
song. All of our best songs have
been written by students through
patriotism to their college and not
for the paltry sum of $10.
