TO NEED GLASSES
is 011 c thing; to l>e properly tilted is quite
I another. We find a difference in the eyes in
I about ONE-HALF the cases which come to us
| fo - glasses. This shows the necessity ot having
I each eye fitted independent of the other. If
j yon are a wearer of glasses, undoubtedly they
used adjusting—we do this without charge.
