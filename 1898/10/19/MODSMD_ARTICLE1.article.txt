# TAX EXEMPTION MEETINGS.
## Students Called Upon Show a Willingness and Determination to Further the Cause. 
### 
The call for meetings issued by
the executive committee of the Tax
Exemption Club met with a hearty
response on the part of the stu
dents, the nine meetings being at
tended by enthusiastic and willing
men and women anxious to do all
within their power to bring about
the exemption of our University
from taxation. Professor Clark B.
Whittier presented the facts to
those at three meetings. Professor
Nathan Abbott and (). C. Leiter,
'99, to those at three others, and J.
F. Sheehan, '95, and Frank Adams,
'00, to the remainder. A syllabus
containing exactly what is wanted,
how it is to be obtained, and just
what each individual can do to fur
ther the movement was presented
to each one present so that each
one will have a basis upon which
to work.
A general discussion of the work i
brought out the fact that there is J
hardly a student in the University ;
whose residence is in California but
who knows personally some one or
more of the candidates for the leg
islature, or some one who has in
fluence with them. This is the
ground originally taken by the
committee and that it proves to be
true augers well for the success of
the movement. The idea is not to
pledge candidates to support our
cause, which would be illegal under
the statutes of the State, but to
seek to lay the matter before them
in such a manner that they will
know when they meet in Sacra
mento in January the justice of
our cause.
A circular letter embodying the
arguments for the exemption of the
University from taxation will be
compiled by the committee at a
meeting this evening and will be
printed within a day or t wo. When
ready, copies of it will be placed in
the Registrar's office and students
may obtain them there.
