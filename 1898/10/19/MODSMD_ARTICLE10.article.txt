\\ iiv is it that we do not have
proper and organized yelling on
the bleachers? The leaders were
appointed some time ago, and have
made numerous attempts to get
things started but the audience,
which at almost every practice tills
the gridiron, refuse $to "jolly up."
W hat may be the reason of this
frosty condition we d > not exactlv
know. Perhaps there are some who
are too dignified to unbend them
selves by yelling. We can onlv
ask them to take a fall out of their
pride and yell. Others may be
tired, lazy, sleepy, or indifferent.
To them our advice is to brace up,
get uJ> on your toes and yell. There
are still others whom we will not
attempt to classify. And our only
advice to them is to yell, and to
yell loud and long. Tomorrow
there will he an opportunity for
everyone to make himself heard,
and we want to hear everyone.
