The days wax finer and finer as
the autumn progresses, and vet we
hear nothing of the Outing Club
which did so much to make life
out of doors pleasant for professors
and students last year. The Chris
tian Associations always have sev
eral pleasant outings during the
year, hut the very charm of the
Outing Club to many people has
been the fact that it existed for no
other purpose than that indicated
by its name. New students, who
have in other places experienced
the pleasure to be gained through
outing parties, inquire when they
first come here if such an organiza
tion exists. Their questions this
year have been answered by upper
classmen in the affirmative, but the
latter are now beginning to wonder
whether they were right or no. If
the Outing Club is still in existence
we hope to hear from it before win
ter sets in for good.
