# Last Night's Practice.
## 
### 
The prompt appearance of the
men on the 1 last night enabled
Coach Cross to put the Freshman
team through a short hut snappy
practice game with the second
eleven. Rice played his old position
at right end and played it well.
Sell, who played the other end,
is a good tackle and breaks the in
terference well, but is too slow in
getting down the field on kicks.
Beedy was again at center for the
first time since his injury. He
plays a good game throughout,
passes the bail accurately and is
strong on the defensive. The team
as a whole is slow in lining up for
a scrimmage, and so not only loses
much time but destroys the snap.
The weakest place on the field at
present is at quarter. Several can
didates have appeared for this
position but have dropped out.
Cooper, who played last night,
passes inaccurately and never at
tempts to get in the interference.
No score was made on either side
and after fifteen minutes play the
practice was stopped.
Later on Varsity was lined up
against the second for ten minutes'
rapid practice. Smith, who has
been laid up for a week, was out
and played his old game at left
end. Faris made his appearance
after a week's lay-off from an in
jured shoulder. He played a strong
game at tackle from the second.
He is quick in starting and tackles
well.
