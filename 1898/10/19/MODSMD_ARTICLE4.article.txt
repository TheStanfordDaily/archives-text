# Death of Hopkins, ex-'99.
## 
### 
The sad news was received here
last night of the death, at his Sac
ramento home, of Alfred J. Hop
kins, ex-99. For the last year Mr.
Hopkins' path was anything but
an easy one. He had a severe at
tack of pneumonia before leaving
college. When he did leave, it was
not 011 account of his health, but
to be with his invalid father. The
constant care and worry about his
father's condition helped to under
mine his own health, and he died
011 the morning of October IK, after
an illness of ten months. The
father still lives, but his condition
is very low.
Mr. Hopkins was but twenty-five
years of age. He made numerous
friends while at college, many of
whom have written to him lately.
These letters brightened his last
days, and he appreciated them.
Deceased was a brother of Owen G.
Hopkins, '9(5, who is now practicing
law in Sacramento.
