# LAST NIGHT'S LECTURE.
## Professor Duniway Talks on the Expansion Policy of Our Nation. 
### 
Last night Professor Duniway
gave an informal talk on the His
toric Policy of the United States
Regarding Territorial Expansion—
a subject of interest to history stu
dents because it dealt with .what
has been done and thought about
this question in the past; a subject
of immediate interest and value, so
that from a knowledge of what has
been done in the past we may draw
our conclusions of what may hap
pen in the future.
The expansion theory started
during the Revolutionary war. Pre
vious to 1753 the colonies did not
exercise any real jurisdiction west
of the Alleghanies. By the treaty
of that year when England was at
the zenith of her power, France was
driven off American soil. About
that time the King of England sent
forth an edict that traders without
a license were not to go west of the
Alleghanies. What the colonial
charters provided made no differ
ence. At this time, also, it was
provided that the western limit of
the colonies was to be the Mississ
ippi River, and not the South Sea.
In the Revolution, both France
and Spain aided us to get our inde
pendence, but they wanted to beat
England rather than help the col
onies. So in the last year we find
that the colonies and England were
on one side and France and Spain
on the other side. When the treaty
was made the latter countries
wanted the western boundary to be
the Alleghany mountains, predict
ing that if the colonies became a
great and powerful nation, ulti
mately, the Spaniards would be
driven off the continent. It has
taken just one hundred and fifteen
years for this prophecy to be ful
filled. England, however, was kind,
and fixed the border line at the
Mississippi River, and by another
characteristic act fixed the southern
boundary at the thirty-first parallel,
or what is now the northern bound
ary of Florida. This line was not
clearly established, however, until
1795.'
In I<S63 England owned all east
of the Mississippi; in 1753 she re
stored East Florida to Spain and
gave her West Florida. This shows
what the United States got from
England and how she got it.
In 1800 Jefferson thought that
to round out our territory, so that
we could freely navigate the Miss
issippi, we must purchase the is
land of New Orleans which then be
longed to France. Napoleon, with
dreams of restoring French domin
ion in America, was unwilling to
make any negotiations, and not so
very long after sent an expedition
to claim Florida and Louisiana, but
which was lirst to stop at the black
republic of San Domingo and put
down an insurrection at that time
going on in that island. But the
troops were so long in San Domingo
that by the time they got through
there, Napoleon's European plans
changed and, being in urgent need
of money, he asked the American
ambassador what the United States
would give for the whole of the
Louisiana territory. Accordingly,

Louisiana was purchased for the
ridiculous) v low price «»f .$1">,0()(),-
0(J0, wliich was $5,000,000 more
than Napoleon would have sold it
for.
The United States thus doubled
her possessions and Jefferson
j thought that the boundaries had
IK't'ii settled for years and centuries
!to come. The New England peo])le,
however, thought that this purchase
was a fatal mistake and would in
time lead to the dissolution of the
l : nion. They wore only jealous
and fearful of their own interests.
In IXIO-12 there was rebellion in
Spanish territory and the governor
<>112 Louisiana, by right of possession
i of armsonly, claimed for the United
States West Florida. In 1819, by
means of a treaty, Spain sold to us
East Florida and relinquished her
claim on West Florida and Oregon.
In the early '20's the Anglo-
Saxon fever for more lands began
once more to be violent. We wanted
more land, but where were we to
get it? France and Spain had no
more, to get any from England
' meant war, so we began to think of
getting some from weak .Mexico.
In 1 SMo 1 exas belonged to the
Mexican Republic, in IS3H she set
up for herself an independent State,
whose independence was acknowl
edged the following year by the
; United States, England and several
other countries, but not by Mexico.
Houston, who was President, began
| negotiations for annexation to the
j United States. England and
; France tried t<» make Texas stay as
she was. even going so far as to get
! Mexico to promise to recognize her
independence if she would not an
: nex herself to our country. This
| made the United States eager, and
it was purchased for $15,000,000.
I People of California know of how
! much value the land is. The active
and vital force which secured not
only the acquisition of Texas, but
j also of California and New Mexico
was a desire to aid slavery.
An endeavor was made to pur-
J chase Cuba in the '70's, and only
| Grant kept us from it. After the
Civil War, Seward got Alaska for
us from Russia.
San Domingo and the islands of
I St. Thomas have in the past, by
popular vote, expressed their de
sire to belong to the United States,
but our government has not re
ceived them.
Thus we see what the policy of
| our government has been up to the
I present time. We have wanted
only that which would pay us by
commerce or political influence. If
>we persist in expansion, we take
upon ourselves new and dangerous
! responsibilities.
It is a fearful responsibility to
take those tropical countries where
the Anglo-Saxon does not flourish.
If we do, the problem will work its
; self out| but it may be at a verv
great cost. We mav not gain, we
mav lose a great deal.
