# DEFEATED BY IOWA.
## The 						Play of Our Varsity a Woeful Disappointment in Today's Game. 
### 
Stanford football prestige was
trampled to the dust this after
afternoon. In mid-season after
a month of splendid coaching
our Varsity eleven was beaten,
outplayed, outclassed by a patched
upteam from the lowa Volunteers.
Our line of stalwarts bent before
the rushes of the opponents and as
the enemy crossed the streaks of
whitewash the heart of every Stan
ford man sank within him. That
the lowa boys played a strong game
is conceded. That fact, however,
was lost upon the spectators. The
University eyes were on the cardi
nal jerseys and what stood out as
the saddest of truths was the disin
tegration, listlessness, lack of spirit
and lack of the use of grey matter
on the part of the Varsity. Chief
of all the obvious faults was the
very evident lack of that bull-dog
spirit at a vital moment, and there
were many in today's game that have
characterized every Stanford eleven
in year's past. The men did not
get together in defensive work and
stranger to say it was nearly all
individualism when we had the
ball. At times on the defense the
linemen and backs showed a hit of
grit in hurling themselves at the
lowa guard back formation, broke
well into it for an instant and then
with seemingly utter lack of foot
ball instinct failed to keep an eye
out for the man with the ball, who
slipped out of the bunch for yards
of gain. It is a gridiron maxim
that " if you don't locate tlie par
ticular individual who has the
pigskin, grab for legs." Murphy's
apathy in allowing the full back to
follow up his place kick gave lowa
her only score. The full back had
no business back of that goal line.
His place after a kick is on the
ground.
The general impression of to
day's game is depressing in the
extreme.
We are on a slump. The men
who have been lucky enough to
hold Varsity positions must be made
to fight harder for them or be re
placed. Such an exhibition on the
part of our men it is to be hoped
will stand alone for years to come.
