In connection with the anti-tax
meetings held recently it has
been arranged that Mr. Shee
lian will travel over the north
ern part of California and Mr.
Keesling over the southern part.
Each will do what lie can to further
Stanford's interests. Any 3tudent
who is acquainted with the congres
sional or senatorial candidates in
his own district or who knows any
influential men in any part of the
State, is requested to write a letter
of introduction to them for Mr.
Sheehan or Mr. Keesling, as the
persons are in Northern or Southern
California. Leave these letters at
the Registrar's office not later than
12 o'clock tomorrow.
When the congressmen and sen
ators have been won over, the hard
est part of the fight is to come two
years from now when the amend
ment. is brought before the people.
Stanford students should stir up all
their voting friends and relatives to
do all in their power to help us, for
only by united action can anything
be done.
