# Judge Maguire's Visit.
## 
### 
The Stanford students were
favored with a close look at one of
the most prominent democratic
candidates yesterday afternoon. It
was expected that Judge Maguire
would arrive from San Francisco
on the 11:")!) train and a committee
from the Stanford Maguire club
was there to receive him. The
Judge did not come on that train,
hut a telegram was received saying
that he would stop off at Palo Alto
later in the afternoon.
The committee captured another
celebrity, however, in the person of
William Craig, the democratic can
didate for Congress from this con
gressional district. The committee
brought Mr. Craig up to the Inn,
where lunch was served at a special
table prettily decorated with crys
anthemums.
The gentleman was then driven
about the campus and shown the
sights. Mr. Craig is a graduate of I
the University of Virginia, class of i
'OS, and his comparisons between i
college life then and now were very >
interesting.
Judge Maguire and party, con
sisting of E. L. Hutchinson, can-1
didate for Lieutenant-Governor,
and Judge Robert Ferrall of San '
Francisco, arrived on the 3.40 train j
and were immediately driven to the
campus. They first visited Roble
Hall, where they were shown a !
"typical college girl's room." Next
they were shown about the quad-1
rangle, meeting many of the faculty ,
and students. Encina was visited :
and in the club room Judge Maguire j
was called upon to make a speech.
The Judge said that this was his j
third visit to Stanford. The first i
was shortly after its dedication and
the second on a sad mission as a
member of the Congressional com
mittee at the funeral of Senator
Stanford.
He said that he would not make
apolitical speech, but if circum
stances were such that in the future
he might be in a position to act
upon an v measure for the benefit of
the University such a measure
would receive his most favorable
consideration. Mr. Craig followed
Judge Maguire in ? short but ear
nest speech. Messrs. Hutchinson
and McCaney both spoke of the
value of a university education,
and lamented the fact that they
had been deprived of the opportu
nity to obtain such advantages.
Judge Ferrall made a very humor
ous little talk.
From Encina the party was
driven over to the football field
where they watched the practice for
a few moments. Judge Maguire
was called upon by the grandstand
fora speech and he again assured
them of his good will toward the
University. The crowd cheered and
yelled "Down with taxation!"
The party left on the 5:20 train
for San Jose to attend a democratic
rally in that city. Messrs. Elias,
'99, Snzzallo, '99, Ferguson, '99,
and Fileher,'99, accompanied them,
having been invited to be among
the vice-presidents of the meeting.
The regular reception committee
of the Maguire Club, consisting of
Gregory, '99, Fileher,'99,and Craig,
'01, were assisted in entertaining
their guests by Elias, '99, and
Schwartz, '99, Suzz.illo, '99, Hay
den, '00. and Ferguson, '99.
