TO NEED GLASSES
is one thing; to be properly fitted is quite
another. We find a difference in the eyes in
I about ONE-HALF the eases which come to us
for glasses. This shows the necessity of having
j each eye fitted independent of the other. If
you are a wearer of glasses, undoubtedly they
need adjustingâ€”we do this without charge.
CHARGKS MODERATE ALWAYS.
