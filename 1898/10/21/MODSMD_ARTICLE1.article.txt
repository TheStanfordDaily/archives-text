## Views of Two Former Students Regarding Removal of the Daily Palo Alto. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
As one who took an active inter
est in the early existence of the
Daily Palo Alto, as a typo for six
months after its first issue at the
University, ami for three years
thereafter being associated with
it in a greater or less editorial
capacity, 1 wish to enter a protest
against the removal of its publica
tion to Palo Alto or any place other
than the most central spot on the
University campus, that those who
are to judge may judge rightly after
the facts are known to them.
The Daily Palo Alto is not a
private property. It is a concern
established and conducted hv the
students of the University commun
ity, its object being primarily to give
news to the student community,
employment to the needful, a
printing establishment for the con
venience of the faculty, and lastly,
by the long delayed grace of God
and a reluctant faculty, to become a
journalistic school where those who
worked the hardest and longest, it
was hoped, might win the greatest
reward.
That it was born for other than
financial reasons is witnessed by
the fact that the richest men in the
University were chosen to alleviate
its continual financial sufferings.
During the first two years scarcely
a dollar of revenue found its way
into the indigent editor's pocket.
Therefore can it be said that finan
cial gain was the lodestone which
caused so many to laboriously
grind their way up the editorial
staff at the expense of their stand
ing with the faculty.
But things have changed. Sea
weed is no longer the medium of
exchange. Grit, brains, and work
have given to the University, and
gladly, a patrimony which would
be worth many thousand dollars to
any individual. It has become an
established business, furnishes em
ployment to seven students, distri
buting nearly $2,000 to their yearly
income, of which they are now de
prived. Those put in charge of the
paper are but the agents, the trusted
servants of the University fora
limited period. When the wisdom
of twelve successive managements
has by unwritten law decreed what
the settled policy of the paper shall
he, having only at heart the best
interests of the paper, the students,
and the University, is it right that
strange and unknown gods shall
come forth at this late yet enter
prising date, to overthrow what was
established many years before their
bewildered advent into the first
throes of this collegiate heaven?
The carefully laid plans of Clemens,
Carl He hurts! Smith, and "Jeff"
Wilson, who guided the paper
through its darkest yet most glori
ous days, with a unanimous stu
dent body and faculty behind them,
are to be thrown to the winds for
some caprice we care not what. Dr.
Jordan truly said on Oct. 1, 1801,
that Stanford's greatest possibilities
lay in the fact that site was not
hampered by traditions, that we
had them yet to build. We began
building even then. Individual

control destroyed the University's
first publication, it threatened the
second, but those who made the
Daily possible ever contended that
its life would last only so long as
it was blood and sinew of the Uni
versity life, and though it could be
published cheaper elsewhere, per
haps fora song in the city, yet it
must earn its place as the mouth
piece of the University by being a
central part of it. And 1 would
suggest a remark right here, that if
the shades of many of the Pioneer
heroes were invoked more frequent
ly at this late date, perhaps many
of our alma mater troubles would
vanish into thin air.
Lastly, let the students of the
University consider the fact that
the faculty have vested rights
which must not be impaired. Let
them remember that they alone are
responsible for this change if thev
endure it; that even though they
give the paper its subsistence, they
are the last to get it on delivery,
thus suffering the twenty-four
hours delay system which has been
visited on poor, belated Palo Alto
for so many years.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: I avail myself of the
privileges of an alumnus subscriber
to direct at you some very plain re
marks. It is with regard to the re
-1 itions existing between the Daily
Palo Alto and the University
press that I wish to speak.
In your editorial columns of re
cent date mention is made of the
fact that you have removed the
publication oflice of the daily from
the campus to a neighboring town.
1 wish to ask you bv what author
ity you have done such an unpre
cedented and unheard-of thing.
You must be aware that the
Daily Palo Alto is owned by the
Associated Students. It is not in
any sense a private enterprise. Its
good will is not the creation of the
present business manager and edi
tors, but of all who have con
tributed of their time and thought
to the making of the University's
paper. The daily is (or ought to
be) a public enterprise and should
be run in the interest of its public
The Associated Students elects
each year two men to run its daily
newspaper for it. These men are
allowed to collect all subscription
and advertising accounts. They
need answer for their receipts to no
one. They get out the paper and
put into their pockets what is left
as profits.
The University press was founded
for the express purpose of printing
the Daily Palo Alto, when the
nearest printing office was in Han
Jose, the object being to afford
worthy students an opportunity to
earn money on the campus. Dur
ing the period of its existence the
printing oflice has paid out from
$N,OOO to $10,000 in wages to stu
dents; and scores of young men
have been assisted through the
University by it.
A price was agreed upon for
printing the daily, based of neces
sity on the rate of wages paid stu
dents. The price was a fair price;
and I will say that today the paper
would not be accepted by Crocker's

in San Francisco for the amount it
has been paying the University
press. Furthermore it has been well
printed.
Coming, now, to the question of 1
economy, it is true that you may
gain a few dollars at first by the
change; but I do not think it would
pay you in the end to antagonize
public opinion. The thing has been
tried before, with not good results.
You mav not be aware that five
years ago an economist named
Hazziird. having temporary author
ity over the affairs of the daily, un
dertook to remove it to May field.
Pressure was brought to bear on
Mr. II azzard in two ways: through
his advertisers; and through the
fact that a second Daily Palo
Alto was very nearly started on
the campus, it to be an out-and-out
student publication, printed by the
University press, and with the
same board of editors, barring only
the chief. Of course, the Hazzard
Palo Alto could not run without
advertising; and if it could, it is
pretty hard to run a paper without
editors. So (wisely) the daily was
brought back to the campus.
Advertisers are very sensitive to
public opinion.
I trust, Mr. Editor, that you will
not understand me even to suggest
that such pressure might be applied
in this case. Nothing is further
from my intention. In Mr. Ilaz
ssard's time it seemed the only re
course. It would be the most un
fortunate thing in the world if it
were again required. I am sure
that it will not be. My object is
merely to bring the matter up for
discussion, that you may learn
(unless I am very much mistaken
and things are vastly different from
what they were) how strongly pub
lic opinion is against you.
You stated in you editorial that
the printing office will have to be
moved, and that therefore you were
forced to do as you did. You may
not know that it has been moved
before, three or four times.
I presume, Mr. Editor, that your
business manager is the man I am
after rather than you, you may
assign these remarks to him.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
As one who took an active inter
est in the early existence of the
Daily Palo Alto, as a typo for six
months after its first issue at the
University, ami for three years
thereafter being associated with
it in a greater or less editorial
capacity, 1 wish to enter a protest
against the removal of its publica
tion to Palo Alto or any place other
than the most central spot on the
University campus, that those who
are to judge may judge rightly after
the facts are known to them.
The Daily Palo Alto is not a
private property. It is a concern
established and conducted hv the
students of the University commun
ity, its object being primarily to give
news to the student community,
employment to the needful, a
printing establishment for the con
venience of the faculty, and lastly,
by the long delayed grace of God
and a reluctant faculty, to become a
journalistic school where those who
worked the hardest and longest, it
was hoped, might win the greatest
reward.
That it was born for other than
financial reasons is witnessed by
the fact that the richest men in the
University were chosen to alleviate
its continual financial sufferings.
During the first two years scarcely
a dollar of revenue found its way
into the indigent editor's pocket.
Therefore can it be said that finan
cial gain was the lodestone which
caused so many to laboriously
grind their way up the editorial
staff at the expense of their stand
ing with the faculty.
But things have changed. Sea
weed is no longer the medium of
exchange. Grit, brains, and work
have given to the University, and
gladly, a patrimony which would
be worth many thousand dollars to
any individual. It has become an
established business, furnishes em
ployment to seven students, distri
buting nearly $2,000 to their yearly
income, of which they are now de
prived. Those put in charge of the
paper are but the agents, the trusted
servants of the University fora
limited period. When the wisdom
of twelve successive managements
has by unwritten law decreed what
the settled policy of the paper shall
he, having only at heart the best
interests of the paper, the students,
and the University, is it right that
strange and unknown gods shall
come forth at this late yet enter
prising date, to overthrow what was
established many years before their
bewildered advent into the first
throes of this collegiate heaven?
The carefully laid plans of Clemens,
Carl He hurts! Smith, and "Jeff"
Wilson, who guided the paper
through its darkest yet most glori
ous days, with a unanimous stu
dent body and faculty behind them,
are to be thrown to the winds for
some caprice we care not what. Dr.
Jordan truly said on Oct. 1, 1801,
that Stanford's greatest possibilities
lay in the fact that site was not
hampered by traditions, that we
had them yet to build. We began
building even then. Individual

control destroyed the University's
first publication, it threatened the
second, but those who made the
Daily possible ever contended that
its life would last only so long as
it was blood and sinew of the Uni
versity life, and though it could be
published cheaper elsewhere, per
haps fora song in the city, yet it
must earn its place as the mouth
piece of the University by being a
central part of it. And 1 would
suggest a remark right here, that if
the shades of many of the Pioneer
heroes were invoked more frequent
ly at this late date, perhaps many
of our alma mater troubles would
vanish into thin air.
Lastly, let the students of the
University consider the fact that
the faculty have vested rights
which must not be impaired. Let
them remember that they alone are
responsible for this change if thev
endure it; that even though they
give the paper its subsistence, they
are the last to get it on delivery,
thus suffering the twenty-four
hours delay system which has been
visited on poor, belated Palo Alto
for so many years.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: I avail myself of the
privileges of an alumnus subscriber
to direct at you some very plain re
marks. It is with regard to the re
-1 itions existing between the Daily
Palo Alto and the University
press that I wish to speak.
In your editorial columns of re
cent date mention is made of the
fact that you have removed the
publication oflice of the daily from
the campus to a neighboring town.
1 wish to ask you bv what author
ity you have done such an unpre
cedented and unheard-of thing.
You must be aware that the
Daily Palo Alto is owned by the
Associated Students. It is not in
any sense a private enterprise. Its
good will is not the creation of the
present business manager and edi
tors, but of all who have con
tributed of their time and thought
to the making of the University's
paper. The daily is (or ought to
be) a public enterprise and should
be run in the interest of its public
The Associated Students elects
each year two men to run its daily
newspaper for it. These men are
allowed to collect all subscription
and advertising accounts. They
need answer for their receipts to no
one. They get out the paper and
put into their pockets what is left
as profits.
The University press was founded
for the express purpose of printing
the Daily Palo Alto, when the
nearest printing office was in Han
Jose, the object being to afford
worthy students an opportunity to
earn money on the campus. Dur
ing the period of its existence the
printing oflice has paid out from
$N,OOO to $10,000 in wages to stu
dents; and scores of young men
have been assisted through the
University by it.
A price was agreed upon for
printing the daily, based of neces
sity on the rate of wages paid stu
dents. The price was a fair price;
and I will say that today the paper
would not be accepted by Crocker's

in San Francisco for the amount it
has been paying the University
press. Furthermore it has been well
printed.
Coming, now, to the question of 1
economy, it is true that you may
gain a few dollars at first by the
change; but I do not think it would
pay you in the end to antagonize
public opinion. The thing has been
tried before, with not good results.
You mav not be aware that five
years ago an economist named
Hazziird. having temporary author
ity over the affairs of the daily, un
dertook to remove it to May field.
Pressure was brought to bear on
Mr. II azzard in two ways: through
his advertisers; and through the
fact that a second Daily Palo
Alto was very nearly started on
the campus, it to be an out-and-out
student publication, printed by the
University press, and with the
same board of editors, barring only
the chief. Of course, the Hazzard
Palo Alto could not run without
advertising; and if it could, it is
pretty hard to run a paper without
editors. So (wisely) the daily was
brought back to the campus.
Advertisers are very sensitive to
public opinion.
I trust, Mr. Editor, that you will
not understand me even to suggest
that such pressure might be applied
in this case. Nothing is further
from my intention. In Mr. Ilaz
ssard's time it seemed the only re
course. It would be the most un
fortunate thing in the world if it
were again required. I am sure
that it will not be. My object is
merely to bring the matter up for
discussion, that you may learn
(unless I am very much mistaken
and things are vastly different from
what they were) how strongly pub
lic opinion is against you.
You stated in you editorial that
the printing office will have to be
moved, and that therefore you were
forced to do as you did. You may
not know that it has been moved
before, three or four times.
I presume, Mr. Editor, that your
business manager is the man I am
after rather than you, you may
assign these remarks to him.
Respectfully,
William J. Nkidicj. '!)(Â».
