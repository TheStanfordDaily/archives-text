# Tomorrow's Game.
## 
### 
The game tomorrow will lu>
played with the Olympics, who
have been greatly strengthened!
sinee our 28-to-0 victory two week's'
ago. Last Saturday the University
of California team scored sixteen
points to their opponents' none.
Berkeley's line was given a good
test in that game, their center men
showing uJ> well against the heavy
Olympics. With the training of
one more week's practice, the ath
letic club should be superior to our
eleven in heavy mass plays, but in
defensive work, punting, and inter
ference our team should have the
advantage.
Yesterday's game showed that
the line men have not yet grasped
the theory of line play, Fisher be
ing the only man in the team who
knows how to stop a line buck and
that is by going under it. The cen
ter men would profit.' much by an
introduction fora week of the old
Hying wedge, and in training how
to stop it. After that center bucks
would be easy.
Last night's rooting was the I
most enthusiastic of the year, and
the soldiers seem to have been the j
inspiration. It would be well for!
a large body of rooters to attend
tomorrow's game to cheer on the!
players, to raise them from the
depths of yesterday's game, and to
get them into the habit of running j
against heavy odds.
The line-up will probably be:
Parker, right end; Rusk, light
tackle; James, right guard; Biglow,
center; Blanehard, left guard;
Paris, left tackle; MoFadden, left
end; Murphy, quarter; Robinson,
left half; Fisher, right half; Hill
or Burmister, full.
