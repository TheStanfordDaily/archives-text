# The 						Students' Guild.
## 
### 
So many inquiries have been
made lately eoneerning the guild
that a brief statement by the board
of directors has been deemed ad
visable.
The guild was organized in Feb
ruary, 1X95. for the prime purpose
of starting a hospital here on the
campus, and secondarily to aid
sick students in all practical ways
possible. Since its organization it
ha« done a good work here. To bo
sure very little is ever heard of its
work, for of necessity, it is of a
kind that does not advertise itself.
Several serious cases of illness have
been taken charge of. as well as
many less severe ones. In addition,
emergency medicines have been
dispensed free to members for the
past two years.
The guild is controlled by aboard
of directors consisting of seven mem
bers elected at the end of each year
by the Executive Committee of the
student body. Two of the directors
are members of the faculty, the
resident University physician being
one. There is also a board of pa
tronesses composed of several
women, whose inclinations tit them
for the work of the guild, acting as
a kind of advisory board and as
sisting in various ways in the work.
Mrs. Stanford is honorary president
of the board of patronesses.
At present we have between $800
and $1)00 in the hospital fund, and
if the students would take the
proper interest in the work this
would soon be made large enough
to make possible the erection
here on the campus of a much
needed hospital building. As a
general rule only about 25 per cent
of the students pay their guild
clues. This is a great reflection on
the student body, as the small sum
—fifty cents —a semester is within
the reach of all. Another fact that
is to be regretted is that those least
able to pay are the ones who sup
port the guild; while those whose
financial condition would enable
them to do much good by their
small contributions are generally
unwilling to pay.
At present the work being done
by the guild might be divided into
three parts. First, emergency sup
plies furnished by the guild are
kept at Mr. Cleveland's room in
Encina Hall, at Miss Ray's room
in Roble, by both the instructors in
Encina and Roble gymnasiums,
and at the home of Dr. Wood, the
resident physician. Besides this a
depot for these supplies will be es
tablished somewhere in I'alo Alto.
Second, the directors and patron
esses are always on the lookout for
cases needing the attention of the
guild, and are always willing to do
all in their power to make it as
comfortable as possible for those
unfortunate enough to be sick. It
will be a great aid if any one know
ing of a case needing the attention
of the guild will so inform any one
of the directors as soon as possible.
Third, a trained nurse is retained
here at the University constantly
at a retaining salary of .$20 per
month.
The benefits of the guild are
available only to its members—and
these benefits are many, if one will
but stop to realize. Members alone
are entitled to the emergency medi
cines of the guild free. In case a
member becomes sick and is unable
to pay the bills arising from the in
creased expense, the guild will ad
vance the money to pay them. The
member is expected to repay the
guild for this outlay as soon as pos
sible. but if the member is unable
to repay, the guild assumes the in
debtedness. Members of the guild
also receive the services of the
trained nurse for •tl..">() a day, a
great reduction 011 the regular ex
pense of •+•"».■">(). This is made pos
sible only by the special arrange
ment above referred to in which
the guild is paying continu
ally a retaining fee of $20a month.
The resident physician is the guild
physician. In case a member
wishes to call in an outside phvsi

cian, the I>i lls thus incurred will In'
advanced bv the guild only where
the committee on cases so orders.
The directors will only too
pleased to give further information
as to the guild, or to furnish mem
bership cards, upon application.
