At the very beginning of the year
a worthy custom was apparently
instituted which has since unfor
tunately been allowed to fall into
disuse. The first Sundi'v or two,
students gathered on the Inn ver
anda and sang Stanford songs. The
idea is so good that it is to bo hoped
that it will not be allowed to come
to nothing. This is not a thing to
appoint "leaders" for. All that is
needed is fora handful of fellows
to get together on the Inn step-*and
begin "Hail, Stanford, hail."
