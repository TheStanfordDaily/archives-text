# REASONS FOR THE MOVE.
## Alumni Communications Replied to by the Manager of the "Daily Palo Alto." 
### 
Lust Friday we printed two very
erroneous communications from Mr.
Scott Calhoun, '95, and Mr. Neidig,
'96, which roasted me for printing
the Daily Palo Alto in Palo Alto.
These articles were very personal
and one-sided and cannot help do
ing me harm by giving to people
who do not know the facts in the
case a very wrong opinion. 1 will
not say anything against these two
young men, but want to add a few
points they left out. They wrote
these articles to the paper without
first coining down to the University
to see; and without asking me my
reasons for moving, they took sonic
thing for granted, I do not know
what, and slashed away. 1 saw
Mr. Calhoun in San Francisco
Saturday, and he said he was sorry
the article he wrote had been
printed, and would not have said
what lie did had he known all the
facts in the case. The other man
1 did not see, but he surely knew
very little about the present man
agement and tlie change. This is
not a parallel case to the Mazzard
case by any means. It will only
be a short time before the press
in the power house will move
out. Mrs. Stanford is opposed
to it being there. If the students
were dissatisfied with the present
management or the change they
would surely complain to me. 1
have had jnst two complaints from
students, and they are employed bv
Mr. Quelle, and their kick was for
themselves and not for the interest
of the paper. I a in employing all
the student typesetters that I can get
and am advertising for more every
day.
I am in favor of having the Daily
Palo Alto printed on the campus,
and I would like to see the Sequoia
printed there also; but until there
is a permanent place where we can
print the papers, the managers will
have to go elsewhere. What the
student body should do is to g.'t a
press on the campus that will be
permanent and well managed and
then the college papers will be
printed there and the press would
get more of the work of the Uni
versity than it does now. At
the present time there is no one
who can sign a contract with me to
print the Daily on the campus.
Anybody who investigates the con
ditions as thev existed at the time
1 made the change and d > still ex
ist, will be just as shaky as I was
about remaining in the power house.
1 came to the conclusion that it
was for the paper's best interests to
move at once, rather than be thrown
out at the mercy of the Palo Alto
printers, and be compelled to pay
whatever they asked. To get them
to print the paper 1 had to sign a
contract * to stJy with them
until next May They have
bought a new lot of type, and
have been to considerable expense
in other ways, moving etc. M 'S*r<.
Stephens ife Thompson are doing
verv good work for me, and they
are fine men to work with. My
contract with them was made in
the best of good faith,and although

I would like to see a press oil the
campus, I will try and live up to j
this contract as best I can.
The Palo Alto printer does not j
charge as much as the press on the |
campus, and we are able to put
out an extra sheet, which we could
not do at the price I paid for the
four page paper during September.'
Whether going to Palo Alto to
print the daily was a wise
move re nains to be seen.
I did not make the change I
until 1 had worked for one month
trying to make it possible to stay
on the campus, first consulting
Mrs. Stanford, professors in au
thority, members of the Ex
ecutive Committee and student
body leaders. The Daily Palo
Alto has six pages now. while in
other years at this time it only had
four, and we carry three columns of i
reading matter more than they did.
The extra two pug's cost us for
printing $50 a month more than it
would if the paper only had four
pages.
The paper that we are getting
out is better than any college daily
in the United States. We always
carry nine columns of reading mat
ter, and many times more, while
the eastern college dailies and
the Daily Californian carry
about six; the Harvard Crimson
carries six columns; the Penn
sylvanian six; the Ya/e News six
and a half; the University of
Michigan Daily six and a half;
the Cornell Daily Sun six; the Daily
Cardinal of the University of Wis
consin six and a half, and soon. I
have worked very hard to make this'
year's paper better than anv pre
vious one, and I can promise the
student body that I would not
think of doing anything that would
hurt the interests of the paper
either now or in time to ome.
