# Musical Organizations.

The Glee and Mandolin clubs
will take a trip during the next
Christmas holidays cither as far
east as Denver, or north to Port
land and the Sound cities. The
management attempted to arrange
for them to play in Honolulu this
year, but word was received Wed
nesday evening from there that no
satisfactory terms could he made;
another company h;is secured the
theater for those dates and the
place is not large enough to justify
two such attractions at the same
time. The members have been in
clined to favor the Honolulu trip
and it may be made next summer.
In case the clubs go to Denver they
will have to compete with the
Princeton organizations, whicli are
coming west this year. However,
there is no fear but that our musi
cal talent will compare favorably
with that of any other university
in the country. While on their
tour last winter, our clubs met
three old Princeton Glee men and
one of them, who has had much
experience in dealing with college
musical organizations, pronounced
our men the best that he had ever
seen in any club. A comparison
between Stanford and Princeton, if
the two troupes encounter each
other this winter, would be inter
esting.
All the men trying for the two
clubs are working hard and the
outlook is that both will be un
usually strong. A..). Van Kaa
thoven, '99, is leader and F. H.
Drake, '01, manager of the Glee,
and Ralph Arnold, '99, leader and
R. E. Field, '01, manager of the
Mandolin club. Last year's lirst
and second mandolins are all back,
and nine new men have turned out
for practice, which is held every
Monday evening. The Glee Club
has been weak in first tenors for
the last few years, but these are
now developing in good shape;
several new voices were acquired
this year. A series of entertain
ments will probably be given in
the towns near the I'niversity be
fore long.
Thursday the organization of
the Banjo Club was completed.
Milnor Roberts, '99, h;is been
elected leader and treasurer, R. K.
Field,'ol, manager, and Strong, '99,
Murphy, '00, and Roberts, '99, ex
ecutive committee. Following are
the men who make up the club:
Roberts, '99, Field, '01, Murphy,
'00, Hardy. '02. Mann. '02, Strong,
'99, Drake,'ol, May them, '00, and
Wadsworth, '01. The club will
practice every Thursday night and
prepare to take part in entertain
ments on the campus and to accom
pany the Glee and Mandolin clubs
in their trips to neighboring towns.
It will probably assist in the
Thanksgiving minstrel show.
