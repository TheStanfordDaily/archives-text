Tin-: splendid playing of the lowa
band on the campus Thursday
ought to serve as an incentive-to
the members of our own organiza
tion. The music of the lowa band
certainly enlivened their players,
helping, perhaps, to win the game.
Our own organization should strive
to be something more than it is
and more nearly approach this
standard. What Stanford should
have is a band that might continue
to practice all the year round, and
be in condition to play at the base
ball games and the field-day in the
spring, and.in fact, like the other
musical organizations, whenever
their services are required. This is
done, we believe, at Cornell and
could be done at t his Vni versitv if
the proper interest could be mani
fested. We must work hard at once
to secure the best band possible to
aid in a musical way the success of
the Thanksgiving game. The Stan
ford band at present needs more
](layers. Let every bandsman in the
University get out.
