# YESTERDAY'S PRACTICE.
## The
						Freshmen Show up Fairly Well, but Lack Team Work and Interference. 
### 
The Freshman team was put
through a lively practice last even
ing under the direction of Coach
Cross and Captain Fisher. The
team was lined up against the sec
ond eleven and played one twenty
minute half. No score was made
on either t-i le, but the freshmen
kept the ball near their opponents'
goal throughout the practice.
lieedy was placed at tackle and
showed up well, breaking through
the line often and running well
w'th the ball. Anderson is prob
ably a fixture at center. He passed
the ball accurately and is strong on
the defensive. Both Eaton and
Cairns at guard are slow and allow
themselves to be put out of the play
repeatedly. Webber, the other
tackle, is a careless sort of a player
with a great deal of determination
but little experience. He is strong
and quick, and would be an effec
tive player if he would keep his
eyes open.
Back of the line the team is es
pecially weak. Three good indi
vidual players compose the hacks,
but they have practically no inter
ference and allow the man who is
given the ball to advance it as he is
able. Carson at full is very strong
in bucking through the line but his
tackling and interference work are
weak.
As several members of the Var
sity squad were suffering from in
juries received in Saturday's game,
no regular line-up was had. The
line was practised against the sec
ond team, the latter scoring two
touchdowns. Wilson was out and
played his old position at right
tackle. Burmister was on the field
for the first time in two weeks. Dole,
who was injured iri the game with
the Kansas team, will be out some
time next week.
During pract.'c ■ C e s e: had the
misfortune to throw his knee out.
He will probably he well enough to
play Saturday, however.
