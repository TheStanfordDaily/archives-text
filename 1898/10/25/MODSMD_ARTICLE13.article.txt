# Rowing at Cornell.
## 
### 
Charles Courtney, the famous
coach of the Cornell crews, has
adopted a different system o' train
ing for the crews this fall. In the
past few years the various classes
formed crews, and held a regatta on
Lake Cayuga. Courtney thinks this
did not give the desired opportu
nity for individual coaching. This
year use is made of a pair-oar
barge. Courtney takes all of the
old crew men out daily and coaches
them in their individual faults.
All of last year's freshman crew,
except the football candidates, re
port every day and it is believed by
Courtney that the varsity crew next
year will be made up almost en
tirely of these men
Courtney's system of coaching
has worked so successfully in the
last few races that any change
which he may make in it will be
watched with great interest by those
interested in rowing.
