# Improvement at Harvard.
## 
### 
Harvard gruuuaicn in
have given $14,0( 0 to the athletic
committee for use in improvement
of Soldiers Field. During the sum
mer changes were made which will
increase the ground available for
athletic purposes to forty acres—
twice the present area. All of the
space between the Field on the
north and the new dyke along the
river has been tilled in with gravel
and graded.
New York graduates have al
ready about $18,000 of the neces
sary $25,000 for the new 'Varsity
boat-house. The war stopped fur
ther collection, but work on the
boat-house will probably begin next
spring. The park commission has
reserved to Harvard a river frontage
from the bridge westward. Both
banks of the river will be built up
alike.
The locker building has been
fitted up for the use of the Varsity
and class teams. A new boiler has
been put in for the steam heating
plant. Electric lights will be placed
in the cage to permit indoor foot
ball practice. A tablet will be
placed in the building in memory
of Henry Carey, who gave the
Carey building to Holmes Field.
The running track around the foot
ball field has been completed and
is now practically ready for use.
A nine-foot open-work iron fence
will-be erected around the entire
field. The park commission will
erect that on the north, while the
compensation for the strip taken by
the city of Boston to widen North
Harvard street will pay for the rest
of the fence. — Harvard Crimson.
