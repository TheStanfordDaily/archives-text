# LAST EVENING'S LECTURE.
## George K. French Talked in the Chapel on the "Gold Coast, Ashanti and Kumassi." 
### 
The lecture last night was |
given by Mr. George K. French, of
the San Francisco Call, who in 1896
visited the African countries of Ash
anti, Kumassi, and the Gold Coast.
The lecture was illustrated by stere
opticon maps and colored views*
Said Mr. French: The entrance
to the Ashanti country is best had
from Cape Coast Castle on the Gold
Coast of Africa, a point reached by
English steamers coming semi
monthly from Liverpool, and at
less frequent intervals from Ham
burg. From twenty to twenty-five
days are consumed in the passage.
The long stretch of coast from Sierra
Leone to the Niger delta has been
for three hundred years the scene |
of many a bloody and gruesome j
tragedy, the passengers of every
ship stranded on its coast having
become victims to the fetich rites of
the natives, or else having dragged
out their existence as slaves. It is
a part of Africa that abounds in
dark tradition and tragedy, and
romance has never dared to tres
pass on its forbidden shore or pene
trate its deadly swamps and jun
gles. It is a place where the fiercest
and most selfish passions of man,
white and black, have vented them
selves for four hundred years.
Each section of Africa was called
in those days after its chief product,
such as the old Grain Coast, or
Pepper Coast, now part of Siberia,
the Ivory Coast, the only one to
which its distinctive name is now
properly appropriate. Three hun
dred and fifty miles of the Gold
Coast belongs to England.
Eight miles west of Cape Coast
Castle is Elmina, the oldest Euro
pean station of the Gold coast,
which more than a century ago the
Dutch captured by a ruse from the
Portuguese. The coxswain of a
Dutch ship asked permission to
temporarily occupy the hill over
looking the castle so that his sick
might enjoy a change. He stated
that the plague had been with them
four days and unless this request
was most graciously granted they
would be in sore straits indeed. The
Portuguese commandant consented,
and each day hammocks were slung
and the sick were tenderly carried
therein to the spot selected as a
hospital. As the neatly painted
head boards in the small cemetery
at the foot of the cliff increased
daily the Portuguese officer dis
played his sympathy by sending
wine, fresh vegetables, and other
luxuries to the sick. One morning,
however, upon rising from break
fast, and glancing towards the edge
of the cliff upon which the hospital
was placed, he saw that it bristled
with nine and eighteen pounders
and brass cannonades. The plague
was a myth, the cemetery a decep
tion. Elmina, too strong to be cap
tured by sea. was taken by the Dutch
without the loss of a drop of blood.
About thirty years ago this terri
tory fell into English hands.
Between the eastern and the west
ern boundaries of the Gold coast the
view presented from the sea is varied
and picturesque. The shore is often

girt with great rocks over which the |
surf breaks with tremendous force; j
again, a sandy beach, fringed with
tall, spectral palms, separates the
sea from lagoons and swamps of
immense area, while in places the I
mouths of rivers reveal themselves
by the presence of dangerous bars,
over which the waters boil and
seethe. Native villages, discernible
in the distance, show huts of swish or j
adobe, intermingled with the more
pretentious residences of European |
traders, and forts which have been
erected from time to time during I
the past four centuries.
The Gold Coast shore is difficult
of access, sand bars block the mouths
of rivers, and harbors are lack
ing. Passengers and cargo are dis
charged in boats through a heavy j
surf on a frequently dangerous
beach. These boats, English-built,
of heavy timber, twenty-eight feet
long and six feet beam, resemble ;
ordinary whale boats, except that
they have long, overlapping bow
and stern, which surmounts rather
than cuts the breakers. Eleven |
men and a coxswain compose the!
crew. The latter steers with a long
bladed straight oar, or sweep, the
men sit on the gunwales and j
propel it by means of trident
shaped paddles. The crew, almost
naked, sing lustily while paddling,
bestowing fulsome praise on their
employer who no doubt on reaching
shore will shower them with "dash,"
equivalent to the Eastern '"bak
shish."
The population of the Gold Coast
colonv is about 2,000,000, only 100
of whom are Europeans; the rest
are of many different native tribes,
but all belonging to the negro race.
Most of the natives are still pagans,
j but the presence of Christianity
among them for the last fifty years
has resulted in their modifying
their fetich worship and bloody
! rites.
The Fautis, the tribe lining the
coast from Elrpina to Akkra, are an
inoffensive, peace-loving, happy
hearted race, who readily suc
cumbed to European aggression,
but have been exceedingly loath to
accept its civilization and Christi
j anity. Like the other West African
natives the Fauti is shiftless and
will work only when it is absolutely
necessary. Centuries of life with
out a want that nature did not lav
ishly supply have quite spoiled
him for the advantages of civiliza
tion and its accompanying respons
ibilities. He has a full apprecia
tion of justice, is honest, hospitable
to strangers approaching him for
no evil purpose, and has an abso
lute faith in the superior beauties
of Fautiland, though to white men
it seems the dreariest and most
hopeless place in the world, and
statistics prove it to be the most
deadly spot on earth for foreigners
of all nations. This is due to the
l dam}) atmosphere rather than ex
cess of heat. The temperature
throughout the year ranges from
seventy-five to ninety-five degrees.
Every child takes its surname
from the week-day of its birth,
strangers theirs from the day of
their arrival, with an additional
sobriquet descriptive of some per
sonal peculiarity.
Paternal affection and filial love

apparently do not exist. After one j
or two years the child must shift i
for itseif.
In common with many African
natives the Fauti lives in close com
munion with the vague and mys
terious beings of the unseen world.
If he be ill he believes his ancestors
are summoning him, and lie begs
the fetichman to present his ex
cuses to the expectant shades. They
bury their dead in their houses,i
choosing a room that can afterward ;
be kept fastened up.
These people are good artisans
and make musical (?) instruments
and iron implements for agricul
ture.
Kumassi and the interior country
are as difficult of access as the coast,
is. The native can wend his way
along the narrow path, sleeping!
wherever nightfall may find him,
but the white man must provide j
himself with hammock even, and i
carriers to transport his food sup
plies, etc. Kumassi is 142 miles J
from the Gold Coast. The first five
miles is through a dense jungle, I
then the road is through gloomy
forests and fetid swamps.
Our first view of Kumassi pre- j
sen ted the usual rude mud huts, i
built on either side of a street j
twenty yards wide. This is the
home of the Ashanti; a tribe in
many respects like the Fautis, but
who still practice many savage cus
toms which the littter have given
I U P-
There is no better structure in
' the town than an Akoku's house,
j (An Akoku is a king's interpreter.)
It consists of seven huts built within
a rectangular space thirty feet long
! and fifteen feet wide. For one of
these huts a frame of bamboo, ten
feet long, five feet wide, and eight
feet high, is erected. Three sides
are then covered with moistened
! clay. The roof is of closely-woven
plaintain leaves; the floor, simply
a raised clay platform a foot high.
The interior is daubed a dull red;
the outside is uncolored.
Such is a house in the heart of
the Ashanti country.

There is no better structure in

It consists of seven huts built within
a rectangular space thirty feet long

these huts a frame of bamboo, ten
feet long, five feet wide, and eight
feet high, is erected. Three sides
are then covered with moistened

plaintain leaves; the floor, simply
a raised clay platform a foot high.
The interior is daubed a dull red;

The lecture last night was |
given by Mr. George K. French, of
the San Francisco Call, who in 1896
visited the African countries of Ash
anti, Kumassi, and the Gold Coast.
The lecture was illustrated by stere
opticon maps and colored views*
Said Mr. French: The entrance
to the Ashanti country is best had
from Cape Coast Castle on the Gold
Coast of Africa, a point reached by
English steamers coming semi
monthly from Liverpool, and at
less frequent intervals from Ham
burg. From twenty to twenty-five
days are consumed in the passage.
The long stretch of coast from Sierra
Leone to the Niger delta has been
for three hundred years the scene |
of many a bloody and gruesome j
tragedy, the passengers of every
ship stranded on its coast having
become victims to the fetich rites of
the natives, or else having dragged
out their existence as slaves. It is
a part of Africa that abounds in
dark tradition and tragedy, and
romance has never dared to tres
pass on its forbidden shore or pene
trate its deadly swamps and jun
gles. It is a place where the fiercest
and most selfish passions of man,
white and black, have vented them
selves for four hundred years.
Each section of Africa was called
in those days after its chief product,
such as the old Grain Coast, or
Pepper Coast, now part of Siberia,
the Ivory Coast, the only one to
which its distinctive name is now
properly appropriate. Three hun
dred and fifty miles of the Gold
Coast belongs to England.
Eight miles west of Cape Coast
Castle is Elmina, the oldest Euro
pean station of the Gold coast,
which more than a century ago the
Dutch captured by a ruse from the
Portuguese. The coxswain of a
Dutch ship asked permission to
temporarily occupy the hill over
looking the castle so that his sick
might enjoy a change. He stated
that the plague had been with them
four days and unless this request
was most graciously granted they
would be in sore straits indeed. The
Portuguese commandant consented,
and each day hammocks were slung
and the sick were tenderly carried
therein to the spot selected as a
hospital. As the neatly painted
head boards in the small cemetery
at the foot of the cliff increased
daily the Portuguese officer dis
played his sympathy by sending
wine, fresh vegetables, and other
luxuries to the sick. One morning,
however, upon rising from break
fast, and glancing towards the edge
of the cliff upon which the hospital
was placed, he saw that it bristled
with nine and eighteen pounders
and brass cannonades. The plague
was a myth, the cemetery a decep
tion. Elmina, too strong to be cap
tured by sea. was taken by the Dutch
without the loss of a drop of blood.
About thirty years ago this terri
tory fell into English hands.
Between the eastern and the west
ern boundaries of the Gold coast the
view presented from the sea is varied
and picturesque. The shore is often

girt with great rocks over which the |
surf breaks with tremendous force; j
again, a sandy beach, fringed with
tall, spectral palms, separates the
sea from lagoons and swamps of
immense area, while in places the I
mouths of rivers reveal themselves
by the presence of dangerous bars,
over which the waters boil and
seethe. Native villages, discernible
in the distance, show huts of swish or j
adobe, intermingled with the more
pretentious residences of European |
traders, and forts which have been
erected from time to time during I
the past four centuries.
The Gold Coast shore is difficult
of access, sand bars block the mouths
of rivers, and harbors are lack
ing. Passengers and cargo are dis
charged in boats through a heavy j
surf on a frequently dangerous
beach. These boats, English-built,
of heavy timber, twenty-eight feet
long and six feet beam, resemble ;
ordinary whale boats, except that
they have long, overlapping bow
and stern, which surmounts rather
than cuts the breakers. Eleven |
men and a coxswain compose the!
crew. The latter steers with a long
bladed straight oar, or sweep, the
men sit on the gunwales and j
propel it by means of trident
shaped paddles. The crew, almost
naked, sing lustily while paddling,
bestowing fulsome praise on their
employer who no doubt on reaching
shore will shower them with "dash,"
equivalent to the Eastern '"bak
shish."
The population of the Gold Coast
colonv is about 2,000,000, only 100
of whom are Europeans; the rest
are of many different native tribes,
but all belonging to the negro race.
Most of the natives are still pagans,
j but the presence of Christianity
among them for the last fifty years
has resulted in their modifying
their fetich worship and bloody
! rites.
The Fautis, the tribe lining the
coast from Elrpina to Akkra, are an
inoffensive, peace-loving, happy
hearted race, who readily suc
cumbed to European aggression,
but have been exceedingly loath to
accept its civilization and Christi
j anity. Like the other West African
natives the Fauti is shiftless and
will work only when it is absolutely
necessary. Centuries of life with
out a want that nature did not lav
ishly supply have quite spoiled
him for the advantages of civiliza
tion and its accompanying respons
ibilities. He has a full apprecia
tion of justice, is honest, hospitable
to strangers approaching him for
no evil purpose, and has an abso
lute faith in the superior beauties
of Fautiland, though to white men
it seems the dreariest and most
hopeless place in the world, and
statistics prove it to be the most
deadly spot on earth for foreigners
of all nations. This is due to the
l dam}) atmosphere rather than ex
cess of heat. The temperature
throughout the year ranges from
seventy-five to ninety-five degrees.
Every child takes its surname
from the week-day of its birth,
strangers theirs from the day of
their arrival, with an additional
sobriquet descriptive of some per
sonal peculiarity.
Paternal affection and filial love

apparently do not exist. After one j
or two years the child must shift i
for itseif.
In common with many African
natives the Fauti lives in close com
munion with the vague and mys
terious beings of the unseen world.
If he be ill he believes his ancestors
are summoning him, and lie begs
the fetichman to present his ex
cuses to the expectant shades. They
bury their dead in their houses,i
choosing a room that can afterward ;
be kept fastened up.
These people are good artisans
and make musical (?) instruments
and iron implements for agricul
ture.
Kumassi and the interior country
are as difficult of access as the coast,
is. The native can wend his way
along the narrow path, sleeping!
wherever nightfall may find him,
but the white man must provide j
himself with hammock even, and i
carriers to transport his food sup
plies, etc. Kumassi is 142 miles J
from the Gold Coast. The first five
miles is through a dense jungle, I
then the road is through gloomy
forests and fetid swamps.

sen ted the usual rude mud huts, i
built on either side of a street j
twenty yards wide. This is the
home of the Ashanti; a tribe in
