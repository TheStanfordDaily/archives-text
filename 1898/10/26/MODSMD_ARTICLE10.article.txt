# Yale's Bicycle Team.
## 
### 
The* Vale Athletic Association at
a recent meeting decided to separate
the hicycle racing squad from the
track association. The bicycle rac
ing will he put under an entirely
different head. H. .I. Bowles,'99,
has been appointed manager and
W. F. Minor assistant manager.
The bicycle team has re-elected L.
Tweedy, '99, captain for the coining
year. The plan this year is to have
two regular meets â€”one at the Man
hattan Beach track, open to all col
leges in the Intercollegiate Athletic
Association, the result to be en
tirely separate from the Intercol
legiate Track Association's meet,
and another with the Harvard
bicycle team. The subscriptions
for the new association will be col
lected entirely separately from the
Track Association and a separate
trainer will soon be engaged. It is
expected that active work will not
begin until later than last year and
no team will be entered in the fall
meets.
