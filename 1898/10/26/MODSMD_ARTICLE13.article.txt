# Losing Interest in Classics.
## 
### 
There is undeniably a solid foun
dation of fact for the declaration of
some observers of college affairs that
unless something is done to check
the decline of interest in classics
that hi an li of the curriculum will
cease to be much more than an in- 1
cidental and "special" feature ofj
college life.
Mr. Alfred Z. Read, in the Har
vard Graduates' Magazine, gives
some figures which will be not a lit-!
tie alarming to devotees of classical
culture, lie presents a table of sta
tistics showing that although but 59
percent of the Harvard class of 1897 j
were interested in classics in their j
freshman year, only 6 per cent con- |
tinned the work in their senior year,
In answer to the question, "What
courses do you regret having
chosen?" 20 out of 28 students who
answered "regretted" classics. In
the senior class of 244, moreover,
only 14 chose classics, whereas 128 i
selected history and government,
122 preferred philosophy, 144:
economics, 52 French, 44 chemistry !
and 82 German. Out of 144 fresh-1
men who chose classics, only 14;
stuck to the study as seniors. Mr.!
Reed finds that limiting the esti-1
mate to only those earnest students !
who were graduated with distinc
tion, the same conclusion must be j
inferred. Only 10 out of (>4 "dis-;
tinguished" graduates stuck to j
classics throughout the course.
As Harvard is reputed to be a
home of classical culture, and as its !
courses areelective, the meaning of
these figures cannot be mistaken, j
They show the nature of the change
which has come upon colleges since
the time when classical study was j
the very foundation stone of college)
education and Greek was"the crown i
of a gentleman and a scholar."
Doubtless classics will never be j
completely eliminated from college
courses, but doubtless, also, the in
terest in this branch is declining at
a rapid rate. Not only do fewer stu
dents choose classical courses, but
those who do are more frequently
dropping them in the later college
vears.
