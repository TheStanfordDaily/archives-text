# GOOD FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
## Second Team Lined Up Against Both Varsity and Freshman Teams Last Night. 
### 
The feature of the practice hint
evening wus the good work of the
second eleven. In the practice
against the Freshman team the
second succeeded in scoring one
touchdown and kept tlie hall con
tinually in the other half of the
field. The "guards-hack" play was
used repeatedly and always for long
gains. Faris at half and Gilman
at full advanced the ball ;it every
attempt. For the Freshmen Carson
and Rodolph did the best work.
Rodolph hacks up the line well and
is strong in the interference, in this
respect being much superior to
Cooper the other candidate for
quarter. McFadden, a new man,
was tried at quarter on the Fresh
man team, hut was unfamiliar with
the signals. With practice he
ought to make a good man for the
position. The interference of the
Freshmen was somewhat better
last night then it has been, but is
still slow and scattered.
