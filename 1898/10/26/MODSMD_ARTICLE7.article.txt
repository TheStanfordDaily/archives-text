.Some time ago a committee con
sisting of the managers of the three
athletic teams was appointed to in
vestigate the proposition of chang
ing the location of the athletic
i fields, hut as yet no definite report
Vhas been rendered. The problem
\«rhich confronts the committee is
whether or not the arboretum is a
-suitable site for the location of the
«.university athletic fields. It is a
rdifficult question, but sooner or
'fater it must be decided, and the
sooner it is done the better it will
i He, for then the managers will know
* -xuetly on what ground they stand
\«rhen questions of permanent versus
.'temporary improvements are
brought before them for considera
tion. We wish to urge immediate
attention to this matter so that a
solution nisi v be reache.l as soon as
».is possible.
