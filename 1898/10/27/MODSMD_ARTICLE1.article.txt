# DISLIKES THE CHANGE.
## J.F. Barnett, '97, Discusses the Removal of the "Daily Palo Alto." 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
As an alumnus and a former
member of the editorial staff of the
Daily Palo Alto I ask the privi
lege of its columns to discuss
the removal of the printing of it
from the campus to Palo Alto.
Any one who has mingled with
the aiurnni of the University knows
they are proud of the Daily Palo
Alto and are jealous of the policy
under which they saw it raised to
its present standard. Nothing
more than a four years'residence on
the campus is necessary to enable
one to understand once and forever
the wisdom and necessity of pub
lishing and printing the paper right
on the campus. Again, an alumnus
is removed from personal prejudice
and is qualified to form an unbiased
opinion upon the facts. With this
knowledge of the general facts
known to all who have resided
there, supplemented by a knowl
edge of the particular facts sur
rounding this present difficulty, I
am of the opinion that the present
management has made a grave mis
take in removing the printing of
the paper from the campus. My
knowledge of the particular facts
referred to are obtained mostly
from the arguments in defense of
the management itself.
The advisability of printing the
paper on the campus was made ex
ceedingly clear by Mr. Calhoun and
Mr. Neidig in their respective
articles of October 21, notwith
standing the present matured busi
ness manager refers to them in his
reply as "these two young men."
The only question now open to
discussion is whether it was neces
sary to make this change. But
first let us ask if the manager had
authority to make it. He is, as
has been said, the trusted servant
of the University fora limited
period. Before taking such a radi
cal step he should have consulted
the Board of Control and they
in their turn should have consulted
the students at large. If this was
not done, and the change does not
meet with the approval of the stu
dents at large, an appeal should be
taken to the Board of Control
and, if necessary, from there to the
Associated Students. All this is
provide 1 for by the constitution of
the student body.
Where has the management
shown it to be necessary to move
the printing of the paper off the
campus? They say that "under
any circumstances the paper could
not have been got out there after this
semester." But they do not say
upon what authority they make
that statement. They do show
plainly, and in the very article in
which that statement is made, that
they themselves do not believe it.
For they say "the University
authorities thought best to ha ve the
paper removed from the power
house that room might be made for
intended improvements." I pre
sume Mrs. Stanford is the highest
authority in this matter, and where
do we find them saying that she
has refused to allow tlx.' printing of

the paper on the cum pun? The
manager claims to have consulted
her, and if she had said the paper
could not he printed on the campus
after this semester, the manager
would not forget to make use of it
as his strongest argument. He
says"it will only be a short time
before the press in the power house
will be moved out. Mrs. Stanford
is opposed to its being there." Not
that Mrs. Stanford or anyone else
has told him that the printing of
the paper must be moved off the
campus. The press has been moved
several times before, and this is a
rather late date to complain "that
until there is a permanent plaee
where we can print the papers the
managements will have to go else
where." Does the present manager
need any greater guaranty of per
manency than did the previous
managers who have made the paper
what it is?
Nowhere has it been said that
Dr. Jordan is opposed to printing
the paper on the campus. When
the manager represented to him
that he would not be able to get the
paper printed on the campus he
agreed with the manager that he
would have to go elsewhere.
He would have you believe that
the faculty don't want the paper on
the campus. "The faculty" is a
broad term. If he means the indiv
idual members of the faculty, I
take issue with him there. They
wish a press on the campus, and
since the printing of the paper there,
is the surest means of keeping a
press there, why should they object?
It is to their every interest to have
it there.
I have clearly shown that there
is no valid contention that the
printing of the paper on the campus
after a certain date will not be al
lowed —that no one prohibits it.
Is there any other reason why it
can not be printed there after the
certain date? It is not claimed
there is. And until some other
reason presents itself, the manage
ment is unjustified in its present
course. Previous managers took
t heir chances, why can not the pres
ent one? The argument of being
thrown unexpectedly upon the
mercy of the printers of Palo Alto
does dot justify the present chang».
There are at least two printing es
tablishments in the two towns of
Palo Alto and Mayfield. Compet
ition would be some protection. If
the manager, as he says, is in favor
of having the paper printed on the
campus he ought to have helped the
cause by keeping it there as long as
possible.
There is only one motive I can
find for the change, and that is the
increase of compensation of the
manager by reducing cost of print
ing. Everyone will concede this
unjustifiable. It would be other
wist; if the paper were the property
of the manager. The paper is not
for the manager, but the manager
for the paper.
The contention that a better
paper can be gotten out in Palo
Alto is unfounded. Everyone was
satisfied with it before the change.
I leave it to the students that they
prefer the best paper that can be
gotten out entirely by student
printers on the campus.

What guarantee have we that stu
dents will be given employment in
Palo Alto in the future as freely
and remuneratively as they have
been on the campus in the past?
Printers tell me that student labor
at the prices paid bv the University
Press is not profitable in an outside
printing house. As soon as the Uni
versity Press is run out of business,
what reason will there be for the
continued employment of student
labor by the Palo Alto printers?
I would ask how many students are
now employed in printing the paper
in Palo Alto, and if the number be
small, or not at all, why is this?
Is it not greatly due to the energy
and business methods of previous
managers that the paper has at
tained such success? And is it not
due to the standing the paper has
acquired while published and
printed by the students on the cam
pus that the present manager finds
it so easy to get advertisements?
Why should he profit once by the
energy and wisdom of struggling
managers and editors of the past,
and profit again at the expense of
all future, managers and editors
and student printers? The same
reasons that prompt the sentiment
in favor of letting the students print
the paper prompted the votes for
the present manager. But thev did
not say, "You may take the dear
old Palo Alto from off the campus
and let the seven die while the one
may live."

upon what authority they make
that statement. They do show
plainly, and in the very article in
which that statement is made, that
they themselves do not believe it.
For they say "the University
authorities thought best to ha ve the
paper removed from the power
house that room might be made for
intended improvements." I pre
sume Mrs. Stanford is the highest
authority in this matter, and where
do we find them saying that she
has refused to allow tlx.' printing of

the paper on the cum pun? The
manager claims to have consulted
her, and if she had said the paper
could not he printed on the campus
after this semester, the manager
would not forget to make use of it
as his strongest argument. He
says"it will only be a short time
before the press in the power house
will be moved out. Mrs. Stanford
is opposed to its being there." Not
that Mrs. Stanford or anyone else
has told him that the printing of
the paper must be moved off the
campus. The press has been moved
several times before, and this is a
rather late date to complain "that
until there is a permanent plaee
where we can print the papers the
managements will have to go else
where." Does the present manager
need any greater guaranty of per
manency than did the previous
managers who have made the paper
what it is?
Nowhere has it been said that
Dr. Jordan is opposed to printing
the paper on the campus. When
the manager represented to him
that he would not be able to get the
paper printed on the campus he
agreed with the manager that he
would have to go elsewhere.
He would have you believe that
the faculty don't want the paper on
the campus. "The faculty" is a
broad term. If he means the indiv
idual members of the faculty, I
take issue with him there. They
wish a press on the campus, and
since the printing of the paper there,
is the surest means of keeping a
press there, why should they object?
It is to their every interest to have
it there.
I have clearly shown that there
is no valid contention that the
printing of the paper on the campus
after a certain date will not be al
lowed —that no one prohibits it.
Is there any other reason why it
can not be printed there after the
certain date? It is not claimed
there is. And until some other
reason presents itself, the manage
ment is unjustified in its present
course. Previous managers took
t heir chances, why can not the pres
ent one? The argument of being
thrown unexpectedly upon the
mercy of the printers of Palo Alto
does dot justify the present chang».
There are at least two printing es
tablishments in the two towns of
Palo Alto and Mayfield. Compet
ition would be some protection. If
the manager, as he says, is in favor
of having the paper printed on the
campus he ought to have helped the
cause by keeping it there as long as
possible.
There is only one motive I can
find for the change, and that is the
increase of compensation of the
manager by reducing cost of print
ing. Everyone will concede this
unjustifiable. It would be other
wist; if the paper were the property
of the manager. The paper is not
for the manager, but the manager
for the paper.
The contention that a better
paper can be gotten out in Palo
Alto is unfounded. Everyone was
satisfied with it before the change.
I leave it to the students that they
prefer the best paper that can be
gotten out entirely by student
printers on the campus.

What guarantee have we that stu
dents will be given employment in
Palo Alto in the future as freely
and remuneratively as they have
been on the campus in the past?
Printers tell me that student labor
at the prices paid bv the University
Press is not profitable in an outside
printing house. As soon as the Uni
versity Press is run out of business,
what reason will there be for the
continued employment of student
labor by the Palo Alto printers?
I would ask how many students are
now employed in printing the paper
in Palo Alto, and if the number be
small, or not at all, why is this?
Is it not greatly due to the energy
and business methods of previous
managers that the paper has at
tained such success? And is it not
due to the standing the paper has
acquired while published and
printed by the students on the cam
pus that the present manager finds
it so easy to get advertisements?
Why should he profit once by the
energy and wisdom of struggling
managers and editors of the past,
and profit again at the expense of
all future, managers and editors
and student printers? The same
reasons that prompt the sentiment
in favor of letting the students print
the paper prompted the votes for
the present manager. But thev did
not say, "You may take the dear
old Palo Alto from off the campus
and let the seven die while the one
may live."
