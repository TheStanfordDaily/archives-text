# Last Night's Practice.
## 
### 
Owing to the poor condition of
the grounds, the Freshman team
was not lined up for practice last
evening. Instead, a light signal
! practice was held. The team is
; rapidly getting into shape and will
; make a better showing next Satur
! day than was anticipated a few
| days ago. They arc a good deal
handicapped just at a critical time
now by the large number of their
best players who are laid off by in
juries.
The Varsity and second eleven
lined up fora short practice, and
although the ground was in very
bad condition, they put up a lively
game. The Varsity scored one
touchdown, Hill carrying the ball
over on a wedge on tackle. Murphy
and Fisher did the best work for
the Varsity, while Plate and Clinton
made good gains for the second.
