Hale. Dr. \\\ F. Harris, Archbishop
Ireland, .J. \V. Mackev and several
I â€¢
others, including F. W. Peck, com
missioner (ieneral to the Paris Ex
position from the United States,
have been arranging plans to erect
a memorial to Lafayette at Paris.
| This is to be a twentieth century
| tribute from the people of this
nation, and will be unveiled on
March I, UJOO.
It is proposed that the cost of the
; undertaking, which is estimated to
approximate a quarter of a million
; dollars, shall be defrayed by small
subscriptions secured through the
I agency of school and college stu
dents.
In reference to the memorial
President McKinley writes as fol
lows:
"This undertaking is one in which
I am sure it will be considered a
privilege to participate, and the idea
that the students in the schools, col
leges and, universities shall take a
prominent part in this tribute will
not only be of vast educational
value as one of the most important
epochs in history, but will keep
prominently before them the in
spiration of a high ideal, of devo
tion to great principles and of the
public recognition paid to lofty pur
poses.
"(leneral Lafayette was but a
young man when he espoused the
cause of liberty and independence,
overcoming well nigh insurmount
able obstacles to do so. It is alto
gether fitting, therefore, that the
youth of America should have a
part in this testimonial to his Â»Â»>cl
ness and greatness."
