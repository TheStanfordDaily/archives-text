# Last Year's Sequoia Manager Answer's Barnett.

### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Mr. Barnett, it seems to me, is
mistaken in his construction of the
constitution. This provides that
"the editor-in-chief and the busi
ness manager shall assume con
jointly the full control and re
sponsibility of the publication of
the Daily Palo Alto." And why
should it be otherwise when the
manager has to furnish a b.m 1 of
$500 not only for his honesty hut
as a guarantee that he shall bring
the paper out without debt? The
student body has wisely left the
manager's hands comparatively
free in regard to publication, sub
scription and advertisement. It
would be unjust to require him to
furnish bonds and at the same time
deprive him of discretion irv p >wers
ordinarily left to a manager of busi
ness concerns. The present ease of
getting advertisements is referred
to, but I think most managers of
college publications, will take square
issue with Mr. Barnett there. I
fancy that neither of last year's
managers found that the past repu
tation of the pap-r gave then any
material prestig,:, in the way of ad
vertisements at least. The hattle is
fought each year, and it is a battle
from August to June, with a lot of
disagreeable settling of accounts
with advertisers, etc., after theclose
of the year.
Mr. Morgan has, it seems to m ',
done admirable work as manager
this year, and a lack of confidence
in his ability lo carry the Daily
through with honor to the Univer
sity' and to himself is unjustifiable

in the light of what lie has accom
plished.
The constitution further pro
vided before the amendment of
April, 1 WW, that the Hoard of Con
trol shall act us a court of appellate
jurisdiction for deciding ques
tions relative to the publica
tfon of the Daily Palo Alto. Bv
amendment the Executive Com
mittee takes the place of the Board
of Control. But their jurisdiction
is only appellate, and when there
is a dispute between editor
and manager.
Mrs. Stanford has reaffirmed
that the press would have to be
taken from the power-house. Mr.
Morgan would have shown a de
plorable lack of business fore
thought if he had stayed where he
was and had depended on the press
being satisfactorily moved to an
other place on the campus in a
crisis such as is now hovering over
it in its insolvent condition. A
full-fledged printing shop such as
is required to run the Daily cannot
be set up in a day when there is no
prospect of a place to put it. There
is telephone connection between the
campus office and the printing
shop. It is not as though Mr. Mor
gan had moved the paper to San
Francisco or to San Jose. Students
can still be employed, a good paper
is published, and more news is fur
nished
