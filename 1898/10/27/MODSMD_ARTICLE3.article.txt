In answer to the communi
cation I cannot concede that Mr.
Harnett is unbiased simply because
he is an alumnus. The very fact
that he is an alumnus means that
he will resent any changes in the
publishing of the Daily Palo Alto
whose former policy he helped to
dictate. He claims to be acquaint
ed with the present condition of
affairs which renders the change
necessary while in the same breath
he says that the manager "should
have consulted the Board of
Control," a committee which
h:is been a defunct institution for
two years an 1 a half. That cer
tainly shows an ignorance of pres
ent conditions. Why this man sent
this article to the paper I do not
know. I can only say that it
sounds very queer, lie tries to
give th" impression that I have
caused a larg ■ number of students
to be thrown out of employment;
now this is not so, in fact more stu
dents aiv employe 1 than before the
change was made. There is not an
idle student typesetter in college.
The students that were working on
the Daily before it went to Palo
Alto are either working for Mr.
Quelle or Stephens At Thompson.
Me.<Bl s. Stephens <fc Thomp
son contracted with me before I made I
the change to employ student type
setters, and all student printers
whether employed or not have a
standing offer from them. A man-j
ager of Stanford papers has a re
sponsibility resting upon him which
it seems cannot be appreciated by
one who has not baen in my pres
ent position. He also has lots of
work to do other than answer com
munications from people who have
not been in college for years, and do
not take the trouble to inquire into
affairs. Before I made the change
I sounded the opinion of the stu- j
dent body and found no complaint |
in fact many advised me to change. |
Only two students have complained
so far. When the manager of a
college paper in his doings does
not meet with the disapproval of
more than two in one thousand, I
think the alumni members
from whom we have heard might
be satisfied.
