Tiik practice of the Freshman
eleven is beginning to show more
than a semblance of team work.
This week's work has been good.
If it had come a little earlier we
should feel more hopeful of a vic
tory on Saturday than we do But
it is better that they should develop
team work even this late than not
at all. The difficulty now is that
so many of their m >st valuable men
are prevented by more or less seri
ous injuries from lining up with
them at this most critical time. It
is too late to lament the fact that
they did not posssess two weeks ago
the dash and unison which charac
terize their present play, however
much that is to be regretted. They
have gone through their hist hard

practice. Now only remains a day
for signal drill and then their game.
A few weeks ago we were almost
diseouraged over them hut hy some
what belated good work they have
given grounds fora degree of con
fidence that seemed impossible
then. If throughout the entire
game on Saturday they can main
tain the sort of work they have heen
doing here this week, we shall have
no cause for complaint or regret. We
hope they will not forget what
every Stanford team must always
remember, that the game is not fin
ished. no matter how the score
stands, until the last call of time.
