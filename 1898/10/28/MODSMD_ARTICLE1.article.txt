The fifth annual Freshman game
between theelevensof Stanford and
the University of California takes
place tomorrow afternoon at Recre
ation Park, Eighth and Harrison
streets, San Francisco. The special
train for the game will leave the
campus at 9:30 a.m. and Palo Alto
at 9:47.
No satisfactory comparison be
tween the teams can be made from
the scores of previous games with
the same teams. Stanford Fresh
men have defeated Belmont and
Lowell, but were out-scored by the
Santa Clara and Olympic Light
weight teams, each of which have
in turn been defeated by the Berke
ley eleven. For the last two weeks
the Freshmen have improved both
in offensive and defensive play, and
besides have shown good spirit,
which was lacking in the early part
of the season.
The Berkeley eleven has Smith
at half, Womble at end, Albertson
at tackle, who are probable Varsity
men, and More at fullback who is a
creditable punter. The Stanford
ends, Sell and Rice, and the guards,
Eaton and Cairns, are the strongest
part of our team, and it would be
surprising, indeed, if they were out
classed, as well as a bail omen for
the Varsity. Gage is light for cen
ter, but is quick and active. Beedy
at tackle is new at the position,
but should strengthen that part of
the line. Webber goes against Al
bertson. the strongest man on t he
Berkeley team, and the battle of
Dole and Guiberson will be fought
over again with the result indeter
minate.
Back of the line Cooper is a
strong defensive player for his
weight, Geissler and Downing are
good at advancing the ball, and
Carson hits the line well. How
ever, the Berkeley backs are also
on a high plane, and the question
which team will win will be decided
upon the spirit with which each
team goes into the game, and the
amount of team work which has
been developed.
Stanford has the best lot of in
dividual players that have ap
peared in a Freshman class for sev
eral years, but their team work in
the preliminary games has been
faulty. The coaching of the last
two weeks should have remedied
this. Each university has won
two Freshman games, and to
morrow's game will give one uni
versity the advantage. If the
Freshman play a quick, gritty
game, keeping their heads, and
watching the ball, and playing for
all that is in them, there should
be a red line of vietorv on the grid

iron tomorrow.
