The recommendation, made by
the Inter-Society Debating League
at its meeting this afternoon, that
the student body present to each
debater who makes the Carnot or
Intercollegiate debating team a Var
sity "S" in the shape of a small
gold clasp pin, is certainly timely
and merits immediate consideration
by the Executive Committee. There
seems to be no good reason why in
tercollegiate representatives on the
rostrum should not receive similar
recognition with the athletes who
strive on fields or track. Such a
pin as is suggested by the League
would serve as an incentive, besides
being a recognition of merit.
