With the increased business back
of and around the engineering build
ings; with the going to and coming
from the bookstore, postofiice, Wil
son's and the studios; there is some
danger to bicyclists and pedestrians
in rounding the corners of the
buildings. In several cases acci
dents have been narrowly averted,
and in one or two instances more
or less serious collisions have re
sulted from the lack of a little care.
There is a tendency toward short
cuts and close turns that should be
curbed. In short, here, more than
elsewhere on the campus, the good
old rule should be observed: Keep
to the right.
