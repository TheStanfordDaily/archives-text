The Alameda Police Department
is making no effort to locate Ad
olpli (ioetz, the missing Stanford
student, who was last seen in that
city. They say they have not
been oflicially notified of his dis
appearance, and without such of
ficial notification do not feel called
upon to volunteer their services in
the search for the missing man.
Mrs. A. 11. Clark of 1417 Sher
man street, at whose home Goetz
was visiting at the time he disap
peared, called at the police station
Sunday afternoon with a picture of
the young man. She told the of
ficer in charge that the photograph
was of a friend who had disappeared,
but she refused to give his name.
She left the picture, however, and
it remained at police headquarters
until the following day when she
sent for it.
A possible clew to the missing
student is furnished bv Officer
Kamp. He saw the picture and
states that late Sunday afternoon
he saw a young man who very
much resembled the photograph
walking along Park street in the di
rection of the tidal canal.
Not knowing the young fellow's
name, or the name of the lady who
had reported him missing, I was
in no position to stop him, as he
was minding his own business and
disturbing no one," said the police
man.
Up to this evening nothing
further had been heard of the young
man. Mrs. Clark has received in
formation from Palo Alto to the ef
fect that when Goetz left the Uni
versity Saturday he had over $60
in his possession. How much of
this he had left when he reached
Mrs. Clark's home is not known, as
he did not display any money there
and did not discuss his financial af
fairs.
