# CADET TEAM SCORES.
## League of the Eleven Run Up Five Points to the Varsity's Eighteen. 
### 
The Varsity won from the League
of the Cross Cadets this afternoon
by a score of 18 to 5. Each team
scored once in the first half and
Stanford twice in the second
when the Cadets were very much
weakened.
Both teams played straight foot
hall, and the Cadets put up the clean
est game of a visiting team on the
campus this year. Both scored hy
bucks, although Stanford varied
the game occasionally by long runs
by Murphy, and Clinton. Fisher,
Hill and Burmister are each ac
credited with ten yard bucks. The
tackles Rusk and Wilson also ran
well with the ball.
The Varsity showed clearly some
little improvemement in de
fensive work, but the team
was still weak and seemed to rely
on stands near the goal line rather
than on the twenty-five yard line
where the danger signal should be
hung out. The team made a good
stand, but the ball was over by an
inch or less. On the offensive the
team was strong. The chief fault
of the Varsitv is in not following
the ball.
Murphv's run of forty yard s from
the kick-off was the best seen on
the campus this year, Clinton put
up an excellent game on the of
fense and the defense. Fisher and
Burmister backed up the line well.
