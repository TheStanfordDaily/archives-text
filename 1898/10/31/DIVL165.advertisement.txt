TO NEED GLASSES
is one thing; to be properly fitted is quite
another. We find a difference in the eyes in
al>out ONE-HALF the cases which come to us
lor glasses. This shows the necessity of having
each eye fitted independent of the other. It
you are a wearer of glasses undoubtedly they
need adjusting—we do this without charge.
CHARGES MODERATE ALWAYS.
