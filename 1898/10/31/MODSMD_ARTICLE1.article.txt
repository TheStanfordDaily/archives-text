# COLLEGE REPUBLICAN RALLY.
## The 						Intercollegiate Demonstration at Woodward's Pavilion Was a Success. 
### 
The Republican demonstration
held at Woodward's Pavilion, San
Francisco, last Saturday evening
under the auspices of the Gage
clubs of Stanford University anil
the University of California was
very successful and undoubtedly
accomplished much good for the
cause of Republicanism in the pres
ent campaign.
Owing to the fact that the Good-
Roads Parade took place on the
same evening the building was not
crowded as it was hoped it would
be, but nevertheless, a very large
audience was present and they
thoroughly appreciated the politi
cal talks, music and general
good time that were furnished by
the collegians.
The committees on arrangements
had certainly performed their work
well and in no way more than in
the matter of decorations. The
barn-like interior of the pavilion
had been given a thoroughly uni
versity appearance by the profuse
use of cardinal and blue and gold.
From the center of the ceiling and
reaching to the corners and sides
were hung streamers of bunting,
while completely encircling the
room were hundreds of feet of blue
and gold bunting draped on a
cardinal back ground and sprinkled
here and there with golden stars.
On every post around the room was
hung a national shield bearing the
word, "Welcome." The most elab
orate decorations were above and
about the platform, however.
Hanging from the railing in front
was a large piece of rich cardinal
plush and around the sides and
near the chairs hung the national
colors. Above the platform was
suspended a beautiful painting of
Mr. Gage, with a half dozen or
more small silk flags draped about
the frame.
The musical part of the evening's
program consisted of national and
popular airs by the Stanford Uni
versity Republican Band led by
Frank I). Wills, '99, and music by
a double quartet lr< m the Stan
ford (ilee Club consisting of Messrs.
Riley, Lanagan, Bush, Sladen,
Ross, Maxwell, Schneider, and
Drake. The latter sang the catchy
campaign songs which were written
bv students of Stanford and Cali
fornia in the recent prize competi
tion. Both band and quartet
accredited themselves ;• nd what they
furnished was well received.
Professor C. A. Duniway of Stan
ford opened the speaking of the
evening with a very polished ad
dress of welcome. He spoke for
about ten minutes and then intro
duced Mr. William R. Davis. I'.
'74, of Oakland as chairman of the
meeting. Mr. Webster gave a short
address and then introduced C. U.
Keith. '00, of California who spoke
very well fora short time. He was
followed by C S. Chandler, '99, of
Stanford, after whom R. C Daniels,
U. C. '99, made a speech which was
cordially received. Herbert Dam,
Hastings Law College '00, spoke
next, devoting himself principally
to a refutation of certain attacks on
the Just c s of the California Su

preme Court. He made a very
hearty reference to the movement
to have Stanford University ex
empted from taxation and the way
his remarks on this subject were
received showed that the University
had many friends in the audience.
8. G. Bailie, '99, of Stanford, made
the last speech of the students and
owing to the lateness of the hour,
was unable to touch upon the
questions he had expected to dis
cuss. Mr. Bailie was followed by
General W. 11. L. Barnes who gave
a very eloquent address, and fully
sustained his reputation of being
the most finished orator in Califor
nia. He spoke until after eleven
o'clock and until the arrival of Mr.
Gage who went to the meeting after
having attended the big demon
stration in Oakland. Mr. Gage
was taken sick on the way to the
meeting and so was prevented from
talking more than a couple of min
utes. His entrance into the build
ing was the occasion of rousing
cheers and out-bursts of enthusiasm
and he was made to feel that those
there were in hearty sympathy
with his cause.
