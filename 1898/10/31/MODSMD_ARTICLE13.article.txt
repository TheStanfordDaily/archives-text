# Ex-Editor Nourse on the Change.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
It is now my turn to enter a pro
test concerning the removal of the'
Daily Palo Alto from the campus.
I protest, however, not against j
the removal, hut against those un
just and malicious communications j
that have appeared on the subject, j
It is no hard task for an alumnus
of even ordinary ability to sit in a
dingy San Francisco office and
compose tirades against the "hreak-j
ing down of traditions at Palo
Alto." Less difficult is it if they
happen to he under obligations to
the one whose interests are mostaf- j
fee ted by the breaking down of this
tradition. Hut it would be more
profitable to everybody concerned
if some pains were taken to find
out the facts, and this I claim the
writers of those communications
have not done. Had they sought in
formation they would have found
it and there would then have been
no occasion to attack the manage
ment in the manner they did.
With the satisfactory reply of
Mr. Morgan the incident may be
considered closed, but I wish to say
that as an alumnus, as an ex-edi
tor, and as one who is acquainted
with all the facts, I can only en-1
dorse the removal of the paper to
Palo Alto. While we may all re- j
gret the necessity that compelled i
the change, no one can say that it
was not fully justified under the
circumstances. The fact that the j
faculty and students are satisfied
should be enough to put an end to!
the criticism from the outside. It
is no time for criticism; the man
agement has a hard row to hoe and
students and alumni alike should
tender support rather than censure. |
Yours truly, .J. R. Noursb,
Editor Daily Palo Alto, 1897.
