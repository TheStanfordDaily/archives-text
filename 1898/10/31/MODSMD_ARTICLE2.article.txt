Rev. H. Melville Tenney of San
Jose preached on the "Sins of Omis
sion" yesterday from the text,
"Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of
the Lord; curse ye bitterly the in
habitants thereof, because they
came not to the help of the Lord
against the mighty."
The sin of the people of Meroz,
said the preacher, was not in doing
any positive injury to the Israelites
but in failing to give them positive
aid in their struggle against
Canaan. Such a curse always falls
upon the enemies of God, not as a
form of punishment, but as the in
evitable result of the natural order
of things. The consequence of sin
is in accordance with the great con
stitutional law of the universe.
The failure to perform any duty
always entails a penalty. This is
the teaching not only of the Old
Testament but also of Christ, who
never uttered a word of curse.
The one condition of salvation is
a belief in Jesus Christ that works
by love, following in the footsteps
of the great teacher and doing good.
There can be no moral or spiritual
development without doing positive
good. The man who simply refrains
from lying, stealing, cheating or
any vice may be good, but he will
not be good for anything unless he
puts forth well-directed energy.
Only the man who fights in the
battle of life is prepared to enter
heaven, which is built upon the
consummation of victories won
here. We can be in a heaven of
fellowship with th ■ h *ro \s of earth
only if we are heroes ourselves.
