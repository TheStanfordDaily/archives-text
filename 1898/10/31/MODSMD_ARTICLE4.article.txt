# STANFORD FRESHMEN LOSE.
## The 						Fifth Intercollegiate Contest Won by Berkeley by a Score of 21--0. 
### 
The first intercollegiate football
contest that Berkeley has won for
two years, and also the odd game
of the Freshman series was added
to the California list Saturday
when their '02 eleven rolled the
Stanford '02 team in the dust fora
score of 21-0. As an exhibition of
football it was the case of a care
fully trained team of spirited play
ers against eleven men who were
not masters of team play, and who
lost the last semblance of unity in
effort after they were pounded
steadily for touchdown after touch
down.
The Stanford team did not have
the ginger of a few days past and
may have become deadened in the
vain attempt to master a difficult
game in less than two weeks, but on
the field their play was lifeless com
pared to the quick, snappy move
ment of the Berkeley men. For
beef Stanford had enough, but the
play was wofullv slow. The Berke
ley players always had the jump,
and on the offensive would have the
whole team in motion before the
Stanford line had started. On the
defensive, the few times Stanford
had the ball they kept up the pace,
and when the ball was snapped the
whole Berkeley line would smash
into the play as a man, and the re
sult would be the stopping of the
play before a gain was made.
Rarely were gains of live yards
made by the Stanford Freshmen in
the required number of downs.
The Freshmen played hard; they
fought the best fight they were cap
able of, especially considering their
knowledge of the game, the lack of
which was not remarkable when
the difficulty is considered which
coachers have had in arousing the
spirit of the men, a thing accom
plished only within two weeks of
the game. Occasional stands were
made which were excellent, and
showed the stuff the team was made
of individually. Once they clearly
held the Berkeley team on downs,
near the goal-line, but when the
mess was settled the ball was de
clared over, wl.en no gain had been
made.
Where Stanford lost and Berkeley
won was in the slowness of the
team, their failure to start quickly,
the high playing of the center men,
who rarely got low in the line, and
above all the poor handling of the
punts. Berkeley played a punting
game, and gained ten yards in an
exchange, and often the ball on a
fumble. Carson got his punts off
well, but handled them poorly.
Playing high in the line is in the
Stanford atmosphere this year, and
the Freshmen only follow the Var
sity example. As one of the San
Francisco writers says: " The re
sult of the game was an eye-opener
and may have the effect of putting
some life into the Yarsitv candi
dates."
The details of the game are un
interesting. Two touchdowns in
each half were made by a series of
plunges through the line, end runs,
and punts. California kicked off.
Stanford ran up against' a stone

wall for no gain and punted. Lipp
man, More and Smith carried the
hall to til-.* Fresh na 1 two-yard line,
where the Stanford men made a
stand for the hall on downs. Car
son punted, and Sell dropped More
in neat style. Berkeley commenced
to hammer the line, and after a few
gains wis held, miinly through
Webber's good work. Again Stan
ford failed to gain, and Carson
punted a pretty twenty-four yards
to Smith, whom Rice downed. More
punted, Carson fumbled, and Worn
hie fell on the ball. Line battering
and end runs carried the ball into
dangerous territory, and Albertson
finally scored a touchdown in nine
teen minutes. Score 5-0.
Carson kicked off, Smith return
ing. Guards back netted four
yards, but the ball was lost on
downs on the thirty yard line. The
line could not hold, and Lippman
finally carried the ball around the
end for the second touchdown. No
goal. Score KM). The remainder
of the half was consumed in punts;
and with the ball in the center.
Stanford took it on downs, and
when the whistle blew Frisselle
had just carried the ball ten yards.
Second half—Carson kicked off.
More returned. Stanford was
forced to punt. More punts, a fif
teen-yard run by More, and Cali
fornia mustered up her scoring
energy in short bucks and plunges,
Smith going through the center for
the third down. Score, 15-0; no
goal.
Carson kicked off, More returned
and on fumble it was Lippman's
ball. Straight down the field the
Berkeley backs went, Smith once
bucking straight through the line
to the fullback. Score, 21-0, Smith
kicking goal.
In the remainder of the game
the Freshmen braced up and gained
a few yards on guards hue'; and
Rice made a pretty run, unaided,
for twenty yards around the end.
After an exchange of punts Fris
selle went through the line for ten,
and Rice for three. Two exchanges
of punts left the ball near the cen
ter of the field at the call of time.
Smith, Wo.nble, and Albertson
are the stars of the Berkeley team,
although all the players were con
sistent Rice and Sell each made
star tackles, although frequently
missing. Webber at tackle and
Cooper at quarter played the best
defensive games. The guards back
was too slow to gain.
