The Freshman defeat and the
California triumph are not much
in themselves, hut they point clearly
to the course we must pursue in the
next three weeks before the Thanks
giving game. Varsity and second
eleven men must go into the prac
tices with renewed determination so
that on the day of the big game the
best men will be on the team
and will know the game too well
to forget the rudiments of the play
in the excitement of the hour. The
men should appear on the Held
promptly and play with all the
spirit possible. Football is a game
where spirit and snap count, and
unless the men get in the habit of
playing in that way they will be
unable to do so when such play is
absolutely necessary. Upon the
second eleven and the bleachers it
depends whether the next three
weeks will be characterized by list
less shitlessness or spirited deter
mination. The student body, Var
sity, second eleven, rooters, fresh
men, and digs must rise to the
emergency.
