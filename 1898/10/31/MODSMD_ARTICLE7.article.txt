The executive committee of the
Tax Exemption Club has prepared
a pamphlet of information on the
matter of exempting our University
from taxation and copies of it can
be obtained upon application to
anv of the members of the com

mittee <>r at the Registrar's office.
This pamphlet is not intended for
such general distribution as lias
been given the short argument
printed last week, yet there are
enough copies to enable one to be
placed in the hand of every one
who will use it to advantage. A
good portion of the matter collected
has been presented from time to
time in the columns of this paper
and those who have kept in touch
with the matter will find nothing
that has not been given in this
way or in the short argument re
ferred to. Therefore, those who
wish to lay the whole question be
fore some influential friend in a
concise form should use one of these
circulars.
