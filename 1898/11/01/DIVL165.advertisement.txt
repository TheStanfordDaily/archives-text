TO NEED GLASSES
\ is one thing; to be properly fitted is quite
! another. We find a difference in the eyes in
about ONE-HALF the cases which come to us
i (or glasses. This shows the necessity of having
i each eye titled independent of the other. It
I you are a wearer ol glasses, undoubtedly they
i need adjusting—we do this without charge.
CHARGES MODERATE ALWAYS.
