# YESTERDAY'S PRACTICE.
## The 						Men Show More Spirit and Play with Something of the Old Time Vim. 
### 
A yelling and enthusiastic crowd
on the bleachers and good playing
by both teams gave last night's
practice the old-time Stanford ring.
It was hard and fast. The Varsity
and the second team worked with
vim and dash. The second held
the Varsity down to two touch
downs and one of these came at the
end of the practice and after the
scrub had given up playing. Their
work was particularly good through
out the game.
Fickert played guard on the sec
ond team and stopped everything
that came at the center. Gilman,
Daggett, and Bid well on the scrub
did fine work against the Varsity.
Bidwell's tackling was hard and
low. Wilson, Murphy, Ilill, and
James played the whole game for
the Varsity. Wilson made several
fine runs, scored a touchdown and
played like a demon on the defense.
James was in the game all the time
and showed that he has "it"in him
when in condition. Fisher, Parker,
and Smith did not plav, but were
on the field.
The second team had the ball
and Plate kicked off to Hill, who
ran the ball in fifteen yards. Hill
and Clinton gained two yards each
around the ends and Bur mister
made the first down for the Varsity.
Murphy next gave Wilson and
Rusk the ball for good
gains. An end run bv Clinton
put the ball on the second's twenty
yard line. Here the second made
a stand and secured the ball on
downs. Beekley tried guards-back
twice but failed to gain. Plate
kicked forty yards. Murphy ran
the punt in fifteen yards and was
nicely brought down by Bid well.
Murphy tried the second team's
center but failed to gain and lost
the ball on downs. Second failed
to gain and was forced to kick.
Murphy caught the ball and started
down th' 1 field and gained thirty
yards where Fickert brought him
to earth on the second's thirty-yard
line. An end run by Hill and two
slashing runs by Wilson landed
the ball over the goal line fora
touchdown. Murphy kicked the
goal.
Plate kicked off thirty yards and
Murphy ran in twenty yards before
he was tackled by Daggett. The
Varsity steadily bucked the scrub
back and just as Cross called time
Clinton slipped around the end for
the Varsity's second touchdown.
No goal was tried.
