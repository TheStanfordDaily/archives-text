In arranging fora recital on Fri
day night by Miss Grace Barstow,
the Washington Memorial Associa
tion has placed within our reach
the chance of enjoying a genuine
musical treat. The cause itself is
sufficiently worthy to merit our as
sistance, but that is not the only
reason to be urged for attending
this concert. Miss Barstow is one
-.of the few American young women
who has had the honor of being ac
cepted as a pupil by the noted Ger
man master of the violin, Joachim.
-Since her return to this country in
1894, she has scored marked suc
cesses at the few public appearances
she has made on this coast and else
where. Her critics credit her with
perfection of technique and ade
quate musical feeling, combined
with absolute self possession and
thorough simplicity of manner. It
is to be hoped that no one who
loves music will allow anything to
prevent him from listening to such
an artist.
