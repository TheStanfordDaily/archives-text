Nkxt Monday the alumni of San
Francisco are going to send a dele
gation of rooters down here to show
our rooters how they used to cheer
and enthuse the football men of the
past. We shall he very glad to se<-
the old men come back and have
them teach the undergraduates what
the "old time spirit" is. We do

not doubt but that this move on
the part of the alumni will have a
tonic effect on our "rooting."
Our present yell leaders, however,
s'lould get together and exert thein
s'lves to bring out all the yelling
t l lO crowd on the bleachers has in
them, get the yelling up to the right
pit'jh an 1 hoi 1 it there throughout
the practice games for the rest of
the week, and the rooters will be in
condition to hold their own against
the alumni. The yelling last night
and this evening was an improve
ment over any former effort of the
season, but it does not yet carry the
earnestness, vim, and dash that it
should.
