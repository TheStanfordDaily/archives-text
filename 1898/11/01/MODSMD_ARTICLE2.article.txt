# Faculty Entertained.

### 
Hallowe'en is the ni^rlit of all the
year when witches, ghosts, hobgob
blins, wood nymphs, and fairy elves
.are abroad. But judging from the
appearance of Madrono Hall as seen
by members of the faculty and a
' few others who were summoned
there last evening by most artisti
cally designed invitations, fairy
j elves alone had been at work and
| transformed that once prosaic hall
into a bower of beauty. However
hobgoblins guarded the entrance
I and grinned a welcome. Hobgob
lins hovered noiselessly over the
fireplace in the ghost parlor and
| smiled sardonically as the erstwhile
professors and their wives, headed
j by Dr. Jordan, were introduced to
j the phantom family of mugginses.
Rows of hobgoblins winked and
blinked from the window-sills in
the spacious kitchen where Professor
Griffin stirred the bubbling chal
dron of sweetness, where professors
and doctors skillfully carved the
Hour, and Misses Stoltenberg and
Hale won immortal fame l>y scien
tific manipulations of simmering
; apples.
Ghosts hovered around the out
j side and when one was actually
| captured by an intrepid party it at
first seemed somewhat tangible, but
the spot that knew it soon knew it
no more, so quickly did it dissolve
in the moonlight, leaving not even
a shadow a-s a complement to the
echoes of the screams. Many visits
; were made to the pretty room where
cider, doughnuts, popcorn, candy
and cakes were dispensed with gen
erous hand. For the credit of the
Educational Department we will
not omit to state that Professor
Cubberley was once a winner in the
potato race.
There was a ring of genuine
heartiness in the tones with which
the departing guests assured .Miss
Macgillivrav and her associates
| that they spent a most delightful
evening, just as tl.e electric lights
disappeared, leaving the Japanese
lanterns and hobgoblins' eves to
illuminate the scene. L. M.
