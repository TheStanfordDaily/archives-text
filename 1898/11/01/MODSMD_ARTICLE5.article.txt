# STUDENT WATCHERS.
## The 						Scheme of the Republican Stale Central Committee to Insure Correct Election Returns. 
### 
During the past two weeks there
has been enlisted at Stanford and
at the University of California a
full regiment of student watchers
who will report for duty in San
Francisco on the night of Election
day. It is expected that the suc
cessful work done on the count two
years ago will be repeated.
This idea of placing the watch of
the count in the hands of college
men originated with Frank H.
Powers, a San Francisco attorney
and a Berkeley graduate, who be
lieved that by appealing to the stu
dent sense of honor and adventure
results so universally desired could
he obtained. The success of the
scheme in '96 attracted a wide
spread interest in political circles
throughout the United States and it
is conceded to be a very happy
solution of one of our greatest
electional puzzles —the securing of a
fair count of the ballots after they
have been cast. The opportunities
for fraud in the count are obvious
and the unjust advantages taken
by the San Francisco bosses pre
vious to '90 are well known. In '96
the students nonplused the corrup
tionists and made accurate return
possible for the first time in years.
The organization this year as be
fore has a military formation and
a military discipline. At the head
of the system is the colonel with
adjutant and orderlies. Under
him are three majors, each com
manding a third of the Assembly
districts of the city. In each dis
trict is placed a captain and head
quarters centrally located. Each
captain's company consists of as
many privates as their are precincts
in the district and as many corporals
as are necessary to visit and report
from all these privates every half
hour. Each corporal has his own
route and his own squad of men.
The private is at the base of the
system and is the hope of the
scheme. He goes on duty at the
closing of the polls and watches every
act of the election officers until the
ballots are counted and the tally
sheet certified to. It takes all the
way from six to twelve hours. lie
is provided with a hand abridge
ment of the election laws, informa
tion as to nearest telephone, police
station, etc. He keeps a duplicate
tally sheet on which he marks the
votes as they are counted.
He has a badge of author
ity and his rights and priv
iledges are entitled to the pro
tection of the police and the courts.
His orders are to watch and verify
the "calling" of every ballot and
under no consideration to absent
himself from duty. The corporal
who visits him every half hour
takes the total of the important
offices from his sheet. The corporal
after completing his half hour route
reports to his captain, who com
bines this reports with those of
his other corporals and sends the
totals by telephone to the major of
his battalion. The major sends
this report with those of his other
captains to the colonel who in his
turn sends the accumulated returns

to the Republican State CentnfcS
Committee — vvh:e!i organization
ull j torts t lie system. Any ir
regularity wliieh may occur in a.
precinct is reported to a corporal
who gets the word to his captain
the quickest means he can com
mand. The captain calls the police,
meanwhile notifying his superior
officers who send special officers to
the scene. The major object of the
scheme is to secure a fair count;, the
gathering of the returns is auxil
iary. This year there is an import
ant "Corps of Returns" under the
j control of a major who is in com
mand of six special corporal*.
: These men cover the thickly popn
! lated districts of the city and fur
nish returns for the offices not in
cluded in the reports of the regular
! system. The magnitude of the
scheme is seen in the fact that
about 330 men are employed at a«u
! expense of $3000' Rights in the
j entire telephone system are bought
| and no expense is spared to make
the scheme a success.
