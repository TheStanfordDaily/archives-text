Miss Annie S. Peck, A. M., win.
will lecture here Monday, Novem
ber 14, on her tramps through Tyrol
and the Alps has attracted great
attention throughout this country
hv her wonderful feats of mountain,
climbing. To her adventures in.
mountain climbing, the New York
Herald has recently devoted a page.
The following extract regarding
Miss Peck's work, is taken from that
paper: ''Miss Peck is a young-
American woman who has distin
guished herself by climbing the
highest and most difficult mountain
ever pressed by foot of human be
ing She has stood on the summit
of the Matterhorn and waved a.
greeting to friends who were watek
ing through a telescope fourteea
thousand feet below. From the
dizzv heights of Mount Orizaba she
lias plunged down through snow
and ashes, one hand grasping her
axe. the other clasped by a guide.
"Miss Peck climbed nine peaks oi
the Presidential Range all in one
day last autumn â€”a feat which for
endurance and pluck has never
been equalled. However, she
doesn't talk about "climbing" the
White Mountains. She "climbed'*
Orizaba. 18,60() feet high but slie
just "walked up" Mount Madison,
a trifling ascent of 5000 feet above
sea level.
