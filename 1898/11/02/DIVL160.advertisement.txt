TO NEED GLASSES
is one thing; to be properly fitted is <juite
; another We find a difference in the eyes in
about ONK HALF the cases which come to us
for glasses. This shows the necessity of having
; each eye fitted independent of the other. If
you are a wearer ol glasses undoubtedly they
need adjustingâ€”we do this without charge.
CHARGES MODERATE ALWAYS.
