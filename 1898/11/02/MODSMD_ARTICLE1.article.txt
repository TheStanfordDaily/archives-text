# CORNER STONE LAYING.
## Foundation of the Thomas Welton Stanford Library Building Now Complete. 
### 
Long before it was time for the I
exercises on the laying of the
Corner-Stone, to hegin, the students :
and professors had assembled 1
about the north-eastern corner of ;
the Library building to hear the
addresses and witness the ceremon
ies which would mark one of the |
most important days in the history
of the University.
President Jordan opened the ex
ercises by a short address on the
progress of the University's life
since, its conception by Leland Stan
ford. In part, he said: "Some day,
ages hence, the historian will speak
of us as having lived away back
in the beginning of things, and will
look back at us at the time we
laved the corner-stone of one of the
greatest libraries of the world.
"Today is one of those periods
which murk our history, one of the
epoch-making days, one of the red
letter days if we may call them
such, which are scattered through
our University's history. The first
epoch-making day was when out-
University was conceived in the
mind of Leland Stanford. The sec
ond was in 18S7, when the corner
stone of the quadrangle was layed.
The third was in October, 1891,
when the University was opened
and the students and teachers
first came together. Another one
of the these days was early in June.
1895, when we turned out our first
Stanford alumni, alumni who were
wholly ours, and who recieved their
college education here and nowhere
else. Another one was in March,
1896, when we won the suit which
was brought against us to deprive
us of our income."
Mr. H. C. Nash, librarian of the
University, was introduced by
President Jordan as one who would
tell something of the life of Thomas
Welton Stanford. In part, Mr.
Nash spoke as follows:
"Thomas Welton Stanford was
born in 1833. After attending
public schools he entered Poulteney
College in Vermont, where he re
ceived the foundation of his educa
tion. Shortly after his graduation,
following the example of l.is broth
ers became to California, intend
ing to settle here. For some time
he conducted a general merchan
dising business in the mining dis
trict and he also engaged in ranch
ing. But his health suffered se
verely during his stay in this state
and he finally went to the Sand
wich Islands. He did not improve
there, however, and decided to go
to Australia in the hope of finding
a climate better suited to him. He
was not disappointed; he has been
in Australia ever since, his home
being in Melbourne.
"It has been said that this Uni
versity had its origin in the shadow
of a great sorrow. So, too, the ori
gin of this splendid Library Build
ing was in the shadow of a sorrow
no less lasting aiyl overwhelming.
Since the death of his wife his
home has been bereft of all that
made it a home. Mr. Stanford has
devoted his leisure to the arts, liter
ature, and good deeds. ll< • has al

ways been a student, was in fact 1
considered the student of his
family; and he now turns his fond
ness for art and literature to
practical uses.
"I do not think thatjl am be
traying any confidence when I
state that there exist special rea
sons why the name of Jane Lathrop
Stanford must be linked with that
of Thomas Stanford in connection
with this Library building. When
Thomas Welton Stanford received
from his brother's estate the mag
nificent legacy which he inherited,
he returned one-half to his sister
in-law, stating that he would not
accept the whole, and asking her
to make use of this portion as she
might deem best. He did not
mention a library, nor even this
University, nor any way for the
disposition of the property he re
turned. In fact, we may conclude
that his intention was to assist his
sister-in-law in tiding over the
financial problems which he knew
confronted her at that time, That
was at a time when business af
fairs and prospects were at their
darkest, not only for the University
but for the Stanford estate and for
Mrs. Stanford herself. But the
great interest of her life is on this
campus. The property thus turn
ed over to her she has kept
until the opportunity pre
sented itself for using it
without sacrifice. Now, with the
consent and approval of Mr. Stan
ford. she employs it in the erection
of this building.
"Mr. Stanford says that his work
here is not finished, but only be
ginning. But the past and the pres
ent are sufficient for us; we do not
wish to look into the future. If his
benefactions are complete today,
every student of this University,
every one connected with it owes
him a debt of gratitude."'
The next address was delivered by
Professor Anderson whose theme
was ' Suggestive Coincidences." He
spoke of the happy coincidence in
that the building of the Library of
the Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity is begun just three hundred
years after the beginning of the
work of building the Bodleiu Li
brary at Oxford. In referring to
this he said: "It is surely of happy
augury that we lay the corner
stone of our Library upon
the tercentenary of the founding
.of the oldest and most renowned
university of the English-speaking
world. The fact that the coinci
dence is undesigned makes it none
tin; less impressive. It would al
most seem that an unseen hand is
passing the lamp of learning down
from the oldest university to the
youngest."
In concluding his remarks, Pro
fessor Anderson said, "In laying
this Corner Stone, we are at once
! awed and cheered by the contem
plation of a work that shall long
outlast us. A few of the youngest
of those gathered here today may
! return after the lapse of a half a
century to assist at the semi-cen
tennial celebration of this event.
They will look in vain perhaps for
a single one of their old teach
ers. But this ceremony sug
gests not death or decay—
1 it svmbolizes the continuity

and permanence of the human
spirit. This beautiful temple of
books should outlast thirty genera
tions of such as we; but in con
templating its noble function we
feel that with it we can defy mor
tality."
Dr. Howard, who spoke on the
significance of libraries, followed
Prof. Anderson. He said that to
express the significance of libraries
is to disclose the essential fact in
the educational progress of the last
quarter of the nineteenth century.
He traced the development of our
present library idea and spoke of
the University library as the nec
essary complement of the public li
brary,which was in turn a necessary
complement to the public schools
Just before the stone was placed
in the spot where it is to remain as
long as the building lasts, President
Jordan read the following letter
from Mrs. Stanford, giving the con
tents of the copper box which was
placed under it:
"Palo Alto, November the sec
ond, 1898, at my Palo Alto Home.
"I have enclosed in the copper
box which is to be deposited in the
corner-stone of the Thomas Welton
Stanford Library, of the Leland
Stanford Junior University, the fol
lowing articles: University regist
ers, 1-S9l to 1898; circulars 1 to 5;
a book containing Mr. Leland Stan-
plan for the organization of
the University; the grant founding
and endowing it, and a description
of the property embrace.l in the
grant; a copy of the Sequoia, October
28, 1898; a photograph of Mr.
Thomas Welton Stanford; coins of
the day, from five cents to twenty
dollars, in gold, silver and nickel;
copies of newspapers of the day;
a letter written by myself confess
ing my gratitude to God for His
tender love and mercy to me and a
detailed account of the circumstan
ces connected with my husband's
brother, Mr. Thomas Welton Stan
ford. who caused the erection of
this Library in his name; a copy of
the hymn sung at the laying of the
corner-stone; a copy of "The Fol
lowing of Christ," by Thomas a'
Kempis; a copy of the Holy Bible.
"I have also placed in this box
a Crucifix, which stands for my
faith in Jesus, the crucified One,
and I wish it to be perpetuated, be
interwoven with the erection of
every structure on the campus of
the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity. Thus far the crucifix has
been placed with the Bible in each
Corner-stone — one in the quad
rangle, one in the Museum building,
and this in the Library building.
Jane L. Stanford."
Rev. Mr. Parsons then delivered
the invocation during which the
stone was lowered into place. Af
ter a closing hymn by the Univer
sity Choir and dice Club, the bene
diction was pronounced.
