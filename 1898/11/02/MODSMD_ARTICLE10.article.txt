The time has now come when we
should turn our attention fora few
days to the subject of debating. The
preliminaries of the Carnot debate
which take place next week will
mark the opening of activity along
this line here this year. The en
couragement given those who ap
pear in these preliminaries will not
only exert an influence to en
courage or discourage those who are
giving their time to add to our
chances of success in this contest,
but the interest shown by the stu
dents at large in attending these
preliminaries will do much to de
termine whether our best debaters
will consider it worth their while
t > try for places on the Intercollegi
ate debating team next semester.
