# Foot Ball Maxims.
## 
### 
If you don't locate the particular
individual who lias the pigskin,
grab for legs?.
When the opposing full back is 1
going to punt and you try to block
his kick and fail, bowl him over
anyway. It prevents his following
up the ball and putting his men on
side. It also makes him nervous
next time he tries.
Don't wait fora critical time to
come before you take a brace. Be
braced all 11 it' time.
Don't he too friendly with your ;
opponent. Me may abuse your
kindness.
If your Captain kicks at your
game, remember that you helped
elect him. Also heap coals of tire
on his head by making a star play
on the next down. He'll be sorry i
he spoke.
If you haven't got a special co-ed
that wants you to play well, plav j
well and you will surely get one. !
