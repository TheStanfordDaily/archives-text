Hazing and inter-class rushes in
American universities and colleges
will soon l>e a thing of the past. It
I has gradually died out here at Le
high and action lias heen taken in
regard to the matter at other in-
I stitutions.
The authorities at Princeton have
| been striving to abolish all forms
jof hazing for some time, and have
dealt severely with some members
of the Sophomore class and are de
termined to bring the matter to an
issue. As a result the Sophomore
class held a meeting last Tuesday,
at which resolutions were proposed
to abolish all hazing if the faculty
would take back the men recently
suspended and if the student body
at large would insist upon the un
written laws of class distinction.
At a meeting of the student body
o »/
of Dartmouth college, held re
cently, the following resolution was
I passed: "We, the members of Dart
mouth college, in mass meeting as
sembled, believing that hazing is
i against the best interests of the col
: lege, do hereby abolish the custom."
The necessity of class distinction
i is, however, universally recognized.
The students of the University of
j Chicago employed a unique method I
to impress this upon the minds of!
the freshmen. There the freshmen
i have been masters of the upper
| classmen, and accordingly, last
Monday evening they were initi
ated into the ranks of college men
with much ceremony. The exer
cises, held in Kent theater, were
opened by a band concert, after
which all freshmen w r ere pre- !
sented with a suitable souvenir of!
the occasion by a member of the
junior class. They then were com
pelled to parade before their superi
ors in novel costumes and to do
numerous feats to show their humil
ity. President Harper ami the fac
ulty were back of the movement
and only insisted that there should
be nothing bordering on hazing.
In the wrestling bouts, which
I take place every year between the
sophomores and freshmen at Yale, j
| the "sophs" won everything this
fall and made the freshmen strip to I
■ their waists and pull the "Cornell
! stroke" with toothpicks instead of
oars.
Ju these two institutions, at least, j
class distinction is in a fair way to
be preserved.
