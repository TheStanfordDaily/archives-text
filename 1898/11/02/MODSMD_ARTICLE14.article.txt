# Friday Evening Recital.
## 
### 
It may he of interest to Stanford
students to know that Miss (irace
R. Barstow, the violinist, who plays
here on Friday evening, the pupil
of Weirt and Joachim, is the grand
daughter of Judge Rhodes, well
known in San Jose, and a sister of
Fred Barstow, Law'Do, of the same
place.
With reference to Miss Barstow's
ability as an. artist, we quote from
the San Jose Mercury of a former
date:
"The Saturday Morning Club
met in the parlors of the Unitarian
church yesterday. All the num
bers were rendered most artistically,
but it was left to Miss Barstow to
capture the house, not only by her
perfect control of her instrument,
but by her quiet dignity and self
possession, which perfectly assured
her auditors. She will be a delight
ful accession to musical circles
wherever she may appear."
With reference to a concert given
in Oakland a couple of years ago
the Enquirer said at the time:
•'Miss Barstow's solo number, the
much loved Adagio (Spohr), was
given with ample measure of feel
ing without exaggeration. The
Habanera (Sarasate) she studied
with Wiert and its extreme tech
nical difficulties were delivered with
the ease of mastery which half hid
their terrors. . . . Miss Bar
stow's ideals are of the highest and
of intellectual rather than estatic
blend."
Of her playing at a concert in
Santa Barbara on May 22, 1897,
the El Barbareno of that date said:
"Miss Grace Barstow's rendering of
"CapriCcio" ((lade) and "Gesang
Scene" (Spohr) fully justified the
reputation which had preceded her.
The utter elimination of all man
nerisms and the absolute simplicity
of her performance were things to
be remembered and imitated if pos
sible by all students of art in its
highest sense."
From the San Jose Herald of
February 19, 1898, we • quote the
following:
"Miss Barstow's violin perform
ance was a delight in perfection of
technique and a general finished
mastery of the instrument. Most
difficult numbers were rendered in
a superb manner, entirely from
memory."
