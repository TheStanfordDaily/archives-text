# Mrs. Anderson's Reading.
## 
### 
Those who didn't hear Mrs. An
derson's recital last night missed, a
charming entertainment. The pro
gram was remarkable for its variety,
including the Rescueof Lygia, from
"Quo Vadis" ; La Cica and the
Senator, from the "Dodge Club";
the Wooing of Petruchio, from the
"Taming of the Shrew"; the Combat
between Tancred and Clorinda,
from "Jerusalem Delivered"; and
"The Boastful Butterfly." Mrs.
Calhoun, Mrs. Anderson's mother,
recited the Murder of Duncan, from
"Macbeth." Everything was de
livered with taste-sincerity, grace,
and intelligence. If any criticism of
Mrs. Anderson's work were ven
tured, it would be that the more
passionate scenes lacked intensity,
and that in narative pas
sages there was at times a
slight tendency to haste and mo
notony. The flexibility and purity
of Mrs. Anderson's voice and the
exquisite justness of her intonation,
made it a pleasure merely to hear
her. She was at her best in the
"Taming of the Shrew," in fahich
the characters actually seemed to
be walking on the stage. It would
be hard to imagine a more winsome
wilful Katharine.
It is to be regretted that Mrs. Cal
houn failed to estimate the size of
the chapel accurately, and was not
heard. She seemed to have a tine
conception of the very difficult
scene she recited.
We owe our thanks to Mrs.
Calhoun and Mrs. Anderson for
their kindness.
