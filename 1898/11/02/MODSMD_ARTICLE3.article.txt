## Great Improvement Noticeable in the Play of Varsity and Second. Elevens. 
### 
The practice last evening wnt
probably the host held on the cam
pus this season. Both Varsity and
the second eleven played with snap*
from start to finish. Two touch
downs and a field goal was tine score
for the Varsity and although the*
second made good gains at times it
was unable to score. Ilea Smith
was out for the first time since Ais
injury in the lowa game and'
played his old position at end for a:
few minutes. The best work for the
Varsity was done by Wilson and
Fisher. Clinton, who made several
good gains, is helpless in backing;
up the line, as he does not keep his
eyes on the runner. McFadden
took Fisher's place at half and
made good gains through the lin<\.
but was totally unaccustomed to
the place. For the second Bentley
and Plate did fhe best work. The
latter runs well with the ball, but
fumbles too frequently.
