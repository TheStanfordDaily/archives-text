Tiik announcement in last night's
Daily Palo Alto that a Christmas
box is being made up to send to our
boys at Manila strikes a sympa
thetic chord in the hearts of all
true Stanford students. It has been
whispered that Dr. Jordan's thought
of the Manila absentees is to be
measured by nothing less than a
barrel of rosy winter apples. From
Dr. Jordan down let each of us add
his or her mite to the offering which
is to brighten the holiday season
for the brave boys so far from
home.
