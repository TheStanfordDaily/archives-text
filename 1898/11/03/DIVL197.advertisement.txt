TO NEED GLASSES
is oue thing; to be properly fitted is quite
another. We find a difference in the eyes in
about ONE HALF the cases which come to us
for glasses. This shows the necessity of having
each eye fitted independent of the other, li
you are a wearer of glasses, undoubtedly they
need adjustingâ€”we do this without charge.
CHARGES MODERATE ALWAYS.
