# SIXTH AMENDMENT.
## Professor Cubberley Points Out Its Evil Effects on Our Educational System. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Permit me, through the columns ■
of your paper, to call the attention !
of the faculty, students, and their j
friends to the proposed sixth amend-!
merit to the Constitution of Cali-,
fornia, upon the acceptance or re
jection <if which we are to vote next j
Tuesday.
This amendment is one of the |
most dangerous proposals that has
been made in the history of educa
tion in California, and should be j
voted against by every one inter
ested in the public schools of the i
State. The wording of the amend
ment is such that one cannot easily
detect the danger. What it pro
poses in short, is this: The Con
stitution provides that the State j
School Fund (a fund sufficient to J
pay from one-fourth to one-third of
the total expenses of a village or
city school system) shall lie used
only for the support of primary and
grammar schools. Forbidding its
use for high school purposes; the
amendment proposes to get around
this by calling high schools gram
mar schools, and permitting the
use of the State School Fund to
support these sc-sailed "grammar
schools," provided that in them "a
course of study shall be taught
which shall prepare pupils to enter
the agricultural, mining or scienti
fic department of the University of
California."
At first si<iht this seems reason
able. If the state gives support to
the primary schools, grammar
schools, and the State University,
why should it leave the support of
high schools, an intermediate link
in the chain, wholly to a commun
ity tax? All of the people of the
State are interested in having high
schools, and there is no reason why
the State should not render some
assistance, say a third, to a com
munity that is willing to tax itself
to maintain a high school. Educa
tional men generally are in favor
of such a plan, but the present
amendment will not make such a
provision. The way to do it is to
establish a State High School Fund,
in addition to the present State
School Fund, but the sixth amend
ment proposes the present
State School Fund, already too
small, and spread it over 50 per
cent moie space.
The bad effects of the amendment,,
if carried, would include the fol
lowing:
1. The establishment of a number
of so-called "grammar high
schools," having little money to
maintain them, poor equipment,
teachers holding only grammar
grade certificates and possessing
little or no university preparation,
yet offering courses of instruction
leading to the scientific depart
ments of the State University, with
a consequent cheapehing of the
work all along the line.
2. The money to maintain these
so-called "grammar high schools"
having been 'taken from the Ele
mentary school fund, the education
of the IMI per cent of children who
never reach the hitrh schools would

be seriously impaired. The result
would be poorer teachers in every
grade of the elementary school.
3. The increase in high schools
in California during the past ten
years, under the operation of the
present high school law, has been
about one thousand per cent. The
adoption of the amendment would
tend to remove the incentive to any
further increase.
4. Those high schools which
have complied with the present law
as to organization would beat such
a disadvantage with regard to the
so-called grammar high schools,
that the adoption of the amend
ment would doubtless result in the
disorganization of many existing
high schools.
5. While not being able to dis
cuss in full the bad effects of the
adoption of the amendment, all
educational men agree that it would
set secondary education in Califor
nia back from fifteen to twenty-five
years.
Ail persons interested in educa
tion should vote noon this amend
ment, and students should write to
their friends at home and urge
them to do the same.
