# The 						Next "Sequoia."
## 
### 
Tomorrow's Sequoia will contain,
besides the regular departments
two special stories, one an episode
of early California, "At La Laguna
Rancho," by Harry A. Dutton. A
Short story by L. MacF. Bowman,
"A Passage in the Life of Sport de
Smythe," is a clever treatment of a
most unique and humorous plot. In
the editorials Mr. Adams makes the
announcement of a souvenir edition
for Thanksgiving,for which articles
and illustrations are solicited. The
"Arcadian Echo" is in rather a
lighter vein than usual, and is full
of good advice to freshmen.
The last Yale Courantcopies from
the Sequoia Miss Laura B.Everett's
"Fame." The Student Record of
the University of Nevada has used
Bowman's "Triolet" of the first issue.
The News Letter of Johns Hopkins
University clipped Leslie Harri
son's "Quandary." It is interest
ing to note that Mr. Adams' change
of title has resulted in having these
credited to â€¢"Stanford" as well as
the Sequoia.
