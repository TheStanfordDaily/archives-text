Professor Goebel lectured last
week before the Teachers' Club in
Alameda on "Volkslied." We
quote the following from last Sat
urday's number of the Daily En
cinal: "Equally as valuable to the
musician as to the literateur was
the charming lecture given by Pro
fessor Goebel of Stanford Univer
sity last Tuesday under the aus
pices of the Teachers' Club. It
was the true art spirit and un
folded with as much gentleness as
authority. llow exquisite this ten
der tribute in the flesh, of the
prosody versed schoolman to the
poesy of the untaught. How tell
ing the message of the spirit by his
own faith in its laws, yet how
strong the intention of the neces
sity of form —as art, in his own
power of ex pressing it. There was
the sign of the poet as well as the
thinker, for the loss of imaginative
power that seems to threaten the
people. There was depth within
depth to the philosopher who could
but see that the sougs of the people
become the law of their being as
well as the liberty of their soul.
W hat have we that encourages song
in the people? . . . Dr. Goebel
in giving the history of the Yolks
lied showed how genius in art ever
turned to the wellspring of the
people for the invigorating draught
for pure inspiration, citing Goethe
as a notable example. At the same
time the lecturer appropriately ex
plained the 'Spinning Wheel'
clause introduced into Wagner's
'Flying Dutchman' as the faithful
portrayal of an institution that has
been extant since the sixteenth cen
turv."
