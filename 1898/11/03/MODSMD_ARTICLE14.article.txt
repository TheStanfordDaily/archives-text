# Strength Tests.

### 
The arrangement for intercollegi
ate strength-tests was ratified at a
meeting of the physical directors of
fifteen colleges and universities, in
New York last December, and the
decision which was reached at that
meeting is as follows:
Since one of the principal objects
of physical training is the develop
ment of all-round muscular power,
a few simple strength-tests are nec
essary, and that the results of these
tests may he comparable and there- i
by valuable to the institutions at
large, it has seemed desirable to
agree upon a uniform system of ap-,
paratus and to describe such tests |
and methods and conditions of tak
ing the same as will make a total
strength record acceptable to the
gymnasium authorities of the prin-|
cipal colleges and universities.
The strength tests which are to
be used this year in making up the j
total strength of any student for:
comparison are: Strength of back,'
legs, right fore-arm, left fore-arm, I
lungs, upper arm (triceps) and I
chest, and upper arm (biceps) and
back.
The conditions under which total
strength records will be accepted
are as follows: Every competitor
must be a bona fide student in the !
institution in which he is enrolled
and conform to the description of I
an amateur as defined by the Ama
teur Athletic Union or by the Inter
collegiate Athletic Association. All
tests must be made consecutively in
the order mentioned and be com
pleted within fifteen minutes.
By May 1, 1899, each institution
will publish the records of the fifty
strongest men examined this year,
in the order of their superiority.
: From these men the best ten will
j again compete and the student who
I makes the best record in this test
will represent his institution against
those of other colleges. In this con
test the individual having the high
jest record will be deemed "intercol
| legiate champion." The institution
; having the fifty strongest men, as
decided by the largest total score,
shall hold the tronhv for the next
* *
year.
Systematic training for these
tests has been begun in a number of
colleges.— Yale News.
