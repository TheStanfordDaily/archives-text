### 
li. A. Snodgrass, '99, and Ed
mund Heller, '00, sailed last Sun
day from San Francisco on the
schooner Julia E. Whalen for the
Gallapagos islands which they ex
pect to r-ach about December 10.
They took along supplies and «■«ini|.-
ments to last them during the ten
months that they intend to devote
to making a collection of biological
specimens on the islands.
Mr. Timothy Hopkins of Menlo
Park bears the expense of the ex
pedition and all specimens secured
will belong to the Zoology depart
ment of the University.
The Gallapagos are a group of
islands on the equator, (100 miles
west of the South American coast.
They are nearly all small, the larg
est being Bt> miles long and 30 miles
wide. Several expeditions have ex
plored the islands, the tirst of which
was accompanied by Darwin before
1840. The present collecting trip
promises to he the most thorough
one that has ever been made among
these islands. The group is mainly
interesting because of its isolated
nature.
