# No Thanksgiving Show.

### 
The committee appointed to make
arradgements fora show to be given
in the city on Thanksgiving night,
after a thorough canvass, was not
satisfied with any theater or hall
obtainable. There were only two
possibilities but none entirely satis
factory. This, combined with the
fact that there is not time enough
left now to get up a creditable stu
dent show, has induced the com
mittee to give up the scheme alto
gether. It is likely that a large
section of the body of one of the
principal theaters in the city will
be reserved for Stanford. In that
case, it is likely that the regular
play f<»r the evening would be re
touched and embellished to suit the
audience.
