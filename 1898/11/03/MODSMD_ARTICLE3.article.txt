# YESTERDAY'S PRACTICE.
## The 						Team Puts More Ginger into Its Work. "Jule" Frankenheimer Assists Cross. 
### 
Each night the practice is becom
ing more spirited and the enthusi
asm of the bleachers increases. The
men play more determined and
allow no time to be lost in loafing.
Last night Coach Cross was assisted
jby J. B. Frankenheimer, 'Ut),
former half-back, who payed par
-1 ticular attention to the interfer
ence of the second eleven. Fisher
was unable to play and his place
! was taken by Plate. Three touch
j downs were made by the Varsity,
: the first by Plate in a twenty-five
run around the second's left end.
j another by Wilson through tackle,
and the last by Hill through cen
ter. The second was unable to ad
vance the ball and resorted to
punting; the line was very weak and
! could not hold long enough for the
runner to get started. Freeman
was out and played center for
a while. His passing is the most
J accurate of any yet tried for
that position and, with practice he
will make a hard fight for the
i place. Biglow, who was injured
i Tuesday, will be unable to plav for
a week or more.
