Thk decision of the committee
appointed to make arrangements
fora Thanksgiving show that there
filial] be no such show means
that the student body treasury will
not be enriched this year by the
â– #300 or thereabouts that is usually
made by such an entertainment.
There is no fault to be found with
the committee; it did its work and
rendered the only decision that the
tacts warrant. But it emphasizes
again the fact that not so much
money is coming into the treasury as
]ast year, and there are many
expenses that did not fall upon the
treasury last year. For instance,
the student body has purchased the
chapel piano at an outlay of $300.
The cost of the new seats that will
have to be put up in Recreation
Park to accommodate the crowds
which will attend the game will di
min s'i the profits by so much. Las}
year the games with the athletic
clubs averaged over $300, while this
vear all the games in the city have
heen played with an average loss of
$ 150 with exception of the Fresh
man game, and this did not bring
'is as much ;is the same game last
vear. Further there is the pos
sibility of rain to be considered in
future games. Of course if every
thing is propitious the Phanksgiv

ing game will reimburse us for all
expenses and losses.
