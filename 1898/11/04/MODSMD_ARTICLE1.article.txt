# STANFORD VS. OLYMPICS
## The 						Men Who Will Make Up the Varsity and Style of Play of the Teams. 
### 
The last scheduled Varsity game
of the season with the Olympics will
be played tomorrow at three o'clock
at Recreation Park, San Francisco.
Captain Fisher will take up as
many men as possible in order to
give every one a chance to play in
the game. Both teams are now
rounding into form and the most
interesting game of the season will
undoubtedly result.
The Varsity line-up at the begin
ning of the game is as follows:
Oilman, center; Blanchard and
James, guards; Rusk and Wilson,
tackles; Smith and Parker, ends;
Murphy, quarter; Fisher and Hill,
halves; Burmister, fullback. Free
man will go in later at center and
Clinton at half.
The Olympics will be strength
ened by the addition of Hobbs at
center and Smith at guard, and
with Sheehy and Erskine at tackle,
the Olympic line will be the best
the Varsity will go up against this
season, although in some respects
the Berkeley line is superior. The
Olympics are content to play a slow
game in the center, while Berkeley
aims at quickness and agressiveness,
thus making up fora lack of weight.
The Olympic ends McLaine and
McNutt should by this time be in
good form to avoid the straight arm
to which they succumbed so readily
two weeks ago. Morse at halfback
is one of the best men on the
Coast, starts quickly, and is a hard
man to down. With the interfer
ence which the Olympics are devel
oping, Morse should make some
long runs unless the tackles and
guards smash the plav before it
reaches the end.
During the week the Stanford
team has shown some little im
provement in the defensive play,
and a little gain in snappiness and
ginger, due probably to the greater
effectiveness of the "rooting" on the
bleachers. The men have been
starting quicker, but yet they are
slow, and it is not an uncommon
sight to see a man go into the line
on the walk. The best yell given
on the bleachers this week, "Get on
on the jump", contained the best
advice for the team. Half the
reason the team seems weak, is the
slowness of the backs in starting and
htiting the line. A line cannot
hold its opponents forever.
The most discouraging feature of
the play this week has been the
work of the second eleven, and the
few men out for practices. Seventy
five suits have been given out yet
Captain Fisher can hardly muster
twenty-five men for two elevens.
The season opened this year with
fifty or sixty men out every even
ing, and the prospects were bright
for Varsity material. The hour
for practice has been set at four
o'clock, and the coach and captain
desire the whole squad out at that
time.
Next Monday is the day set bv
the alumni for their visit to the
University to "jolly up" the team
and the student body. All the
alumni will be down and probably
some alumni will assist in the

coaching. In the evening :i foot
ball symposium will be held in
Encina. for the purpose of dis
cussing team prospects and singing
the old songs The alumni are or
ganizing to assist in the rooting at
tomorrow's game.
