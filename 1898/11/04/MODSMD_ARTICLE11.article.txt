The improvement in the work of
the football squad and the added
vim and spirit which has charac
terized most of the practices 111 i
week shows that something lias been
wrong and that the men are cap
able of better work than has been

done in previous weeks. This slight
improvement should not serve to
satisfy the college and lead it to be
lieve that affairs on the gridiron are
all right. It should rather make
lis more exacting for we want every
thing that is in every man who
dons a football suit.
This week's betterment can in
great measure lie credited indirectly
to the students who have lined the
bleachers and enthused the men on
the gridiron. They have done much
already and can do more before the
big day arrives. It is good to have
this awakening for when.the alumni
come their work will be easier ac
complished when backed up by a
strong student body sentiment.
