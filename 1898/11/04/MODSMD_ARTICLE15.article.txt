# To Rescind Degrees.
## 
### 
The threatened action of the Uni
versity of Wisconsin, in regard to
rescinding the degrees of Mavhury
and Cochems is attracting wide at
tention. We clip the following from
the "Busy World" column of Har
per's Weekly.
"Report comes from the Univer
sity of Wisconsin of a complicated
case of college discipline, in which
politics, athletics, and rival powers
in the university are badly mixed
up. The Athletic Council of the
university has compassed the ex
pulsion, for professionalism, of
James Maybury, sprinter, and
Henry Cochems, captain of the foot
hall team. The faculty sustains
the council and proposes to rescind
degrees already given to these men.
The Board of Regents is opposed to
expulsion, and frantic at the idea
of rescinding degrees. The students
of the university side with the Re
gents. Mavhury and Cochetns have
both been prominent in politics,
especially Cochems. who wrote "The
Truth About Money" used in Wis
consin in the hist Presidents I elec
tion, and spent nine weeks on the
stump, so the Kepublican State
Central Committee has interested
itself in the case, and proposes to
have the expulsion quashed. What
the upshot will be bus not vet tran
spired. and no one can say any
longer that the Western universi
ties have not waked up to the im
portance of clean methods in sport."
