# YESTERDAY'S PRACTICE
## The
						Play Slower Than During the Rest of the Week and Few Men Out. 
### 
Last night's practice was slower
than usual and the men were not
worked so hard on account of to
day's game, The Varsity missed
Murphy and Fisher, but the Varsity
should be made to place less reli
ance on these two men and more
on the work of the line men. The
line men depend too much on being
backed up by the men who plav in
other positions.
Biglow's injury still keeps him
out of the play and Oilman took
his place at center. Blanchard dis
played unusual ginger, getting
through the line and breaking up
the plays. With more coaching
and more of the aggressive spirit he
showed on the field last evening,
Blanchard will make a valuable
man. Cooper was out for the first
time this week.
The bleachers were quiet, and the
play a little slow 'ue to fumbling
on the Varsity.
The line-up was:
Varsity. Second.
