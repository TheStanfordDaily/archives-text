# THE
						SUNDAY SERMON.
## Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger gives an Instructive Address on the "Religion of a Drop of Water." 
### 
The chapel was crowded yester
day morning to hear Rabbi Jacob
Voorsanger preach on, "The re
ligion of a drop of water." Preced
ing the address, L. Emory '00, sang
a baritone solo.
Dr. Voorsanger drew his lesson
from the one hundred and fourth
psalm which treats of the sources
and uses of water, invoking the
blessing of God upon the soil by
means of rain. This psalm was
written, said the speaker, not by
David but by a Levite about two
hundred years before the Christian
era to be used in the services at the
temple of Jerusalem. Although the
temple was mainly for sacrificial pur
poses, the worship carried on there
included three ceremonies that had
to do with the agricultural seasons;
the Passover, the Pentecost, and
the Feast of the Tabernacles.
The Feast of the Tabernacles, ex
plained the speaker, was held about
October, when hundreds of thou
sands of people from all Palestine
assembled, bringing tlieir bullocks
for sacrifice, and a tithe of all the
fruits of the land. After two weeks
of rejoicing,oceured the first day of
the feast proper, which was devoted
to sacrifices. According to rabbin
ical testimony, the most magnifi
cent and, yet the most simple, cere
mony that of pouring out water,
took place on the seventh day.
"Then the high priest, surrounded
by his 6,000 assistants, and in the
presence of that vast multitude of
spectators, took a crucible of water
and poured it into the ground, say
ing '() God, help us'. This observ
ance tells the story; the Isrealites
were not dependent upon cattle,
upon commerce, or upon manu
facturing, but entirely upon the
soil. Palestine, like California, was
a country of wine and oil. a land
over-flowing with milk ami
honey, above which God's smile
ever hovered.
"As the vicar of God upon earth,
the high priest merely indicated by
the ceremony what is equally true
today; the drop of water that
touches the soil is the secret of our
prosperity and welfare for which it
is absolutely essential. Without
it there would he a humanity of
worse devils than was ever painted
in the deepest hell. Like of old,
we aredependentupon bread, which
comes through the grace of God.
Hebrews are not in the habit of
making long graces before short
meals, said Rabbi Voorsanger. The
sweetest and most impressive form
of grace ever observed is that given
in the Hebrew prayer book, when
the father rises with all the house
hold and repeats these words,
'Blessed art thou, our Lord, () God,
who bringeth forth bread from the
earth.'
"Last year there was no wheat
i;i California because there was no
rain, and merchants all grumbled
about a stagnation of business.
Rain is scarce again this year,
hence the outlook is fora worse
condition of business affairs. Hut
as a moralist, this shortage shows
me another thing: when the price

of grain goes up, the poor will either
have to have more money, or they
cannot get bread. What is the re
sult?"
Here the speaker showed that a
vast amount of crime and vice is
induced by poverty, and declared
hunger to be the greatest anarchist
and rebel in the world.
"This all goes to prove that we are
helpless to some extent and can
only turn to God for assistance.
The libation by the high priest was
a mere recognition of the relation
between the Creator and the child
and an acknowledgement of man's
helplessness if God keeps the waters
of the heavens closed up. I chal
lenge science to come to the spirit of
man and tell him how to get out of
this difficulty; the difficulty of
hunger that comes when the soil is
parched and fails to produce be
-1 cause the sluices of heaven are
I closed.
"In California the story of the
drop of water is that we had no
rain last year and have had none
so far this year. Stanford and
Berkeley depend upon the drop of
water. This institution cannot
prosper unless rain comes to assist
the production of the broad acres
from which its gets its revenue.
The welfare of the State is at stake,
since poverty from famine brings
vice and crime, the terrible condi
tion arising from the want of a
drop of water.
''Let us pray for rain, let us
hope that the land will be drenched,
let us ask even though we don't
know whether it will be answered
jor not. The trouble with our ask
ing for rain is not with the simple
asking but with the way; we too
j often ask for things like spoiled
children. Let us put ourselves in
the attitude of saying, 'Not my
will, but thine be done'."
