Tiik battalion of student watch
ers selected bv the Republican State
Central Committee to insure a fair
count of the votes cast tomorrow

for Htiitc and municipal officers
iias a work t<> perforin of great im
portance to the State. To have
the votes counted for the men for
whom they are cast lias been ;i
prohlum that has always troubled
those who wished to see honorable
methods alone used in politics. As
long as the college man is behind
the chair of the officer who an
nounces the votes there will be no
miscalled names. This scheme
which ere long may be adopted in
other states, originated with a col.
lege man, Frank Powers, a
Berkeley graduate. The hope that
the college man may purify politics
is surely no idle dreim. Where
else could such a body of men who
are intelligent, reliable, and honest,
be secured?
