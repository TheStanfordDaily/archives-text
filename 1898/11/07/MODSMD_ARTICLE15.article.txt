# The 						Recital.

### 
The small size of the audience
that greeted Miss Rarstow's violin
recital Friday evening is evidence
•of the truth of the statement so
often made, that as a student hody
we are not musically appreciative.
To he true, the program was long
and would have heen heavy even
fora conservatory audience, hut we
have no right to deplore the lack of
musical opportunities at Stanford
when we give such poor support to
enterprises of this sort.
Miss Rarstow's playing revealed
a mastery of technique and most of
the numbers on the program were
aimed to display that to
the best advantage This is
notably true of the Sarasate, "Zi
gewnerweisen," the Rach"Ciaccona,"
the Razzini"Rondo," and especially
ofthe Wieniawski "Valse, " in which
the artist appeared at her best. On
the other hand, the "Preislied,"
which demands other qualities, was
the least successful on the program
and revealed but little of the breadth
of tone and depth of feeling one
would expect from the pupil of such
a tone-master as Joachim. Per
haps the most successful number,
from all points of view, was the
Mendelssohn "Concerto," which was
rendered in a thoroughly artistic
way.
The audience was appreciative
and the whole recital was very suc
cessful in any but a financial way.
Miss Rarstow was well seconded by
a very able accompanist"
