# SATURDAY'S GAME.
## Olympics Saved from Another Defeat by Hobb's Clever Work in Blocking the Kick. 
### 
The most gratifying display of
football shown this season by the
Varsity occurred in San Francisco
Saturday last in the game with the
Olympics. The score was a tic. hut
Stanford played the better game,
having the ball in Olympic terri
tory most of the time.
The clubmen had put their
strongest team in the field to con
test the last scheduled game with
Stanford, their heavy line being
reinforced by Wells and Hobbs. It
was thought by many that against
the line-up of Olympic on Satur
day, Stanford would have but little
show to win.
The line-up was:
STANFORD. OLYMPIC,

E. Brown and .1. Code, linemen.
Murphy kicked off to Sheehy
who was tackled by McFad'den
after running it in ten yards. On
second down Olympic fumbled and
Blanchard broke through and fell
on the ball. The Stanford backs
each made a short gain and then
Olympic got the ball on downs.
Before Olympic could gain ten
yards Stanford had the ball on
downs. Clinton saved a fumble
Hill and Fisher made gains but
Olympic got the ballon downs only
to lose it on a fumble. Hill made
a buck to the extent of six yards.
Fisher gained two. Hill was sent
twice at the center which resulted
in the ball being put over the goal
line. Murphy punted out to Wilson
and a moment later sent it spinning
over the center of the crossbar.
Score 6-0. The ball was in Olympics
possession the greater part of the
remainder of the half, Stanford
punting to good advantage when
ever possible.
Erskine kicked off to Hill in the
second half. Murphy ran it in
ten yards. Olympic obtained ball
on offside play but could not gain.
Murphy punted forty-five yards.
Morse ran it in fifteen placing the
ball on Stanford's twenty-five yard
line. Olympic lost the sphere again
on downs. Murphy dropped back
fora punt but Hohhs got through
Blanchard and blocked it, follow
ing the ball and rolling over the
goal line for Olympic's tirst score of
the season. Morse by a successful
try at goal tied the score. Although
large gains were made for Olympic

I>y Morse and Sheehy and for Stan
ford by Plate and Hill, no more
scoring could be done.
Wilson played the West game on
tbe field. He put his man out <>112
the play time after time, tackled
all over the gridiron, and fell on
the ball at opportune times.
Fisher did well until injured. Hill
played a good bucking game at full
but did not interfere as he should
have. Clinton played a somewhat
better defensive but much poorer
offensive game than he usually
does. Blarichard played the best
game he has this season. He kept
his man from breaking through,
with the exception of the time of
the blocked kick, and make a few
tackles himself. Oilman and
James blocked in a highly credit
able manner. For Olympic Morse
and Sheehy distinguished them
selves.
The work of the Stanford line,
especially of the center men was a
pleasing variation to their past
play. It was effective in stop
j ping buck after buck of their heav
; ier opponents. Blanchard showed
a tendency toward offside play.
I Our backs played a poor offensive
game being very slow and forming
j but poor interference for the run
ner.
