It is to be hoped that some defi
nite arrangements may be made to
save the members of our football

team from experiencing such an
other fast as occurred after last Sat
urday's game when arriving on the
campus after a hard and exhaust
ing struggle, they found the doors
of the Inn closed and no meals
provided for them. It is bad enough
to have to hurry from the city
without food. Hereafter if the Inn
will not remain open for the accom
modation of the football men. the
manager would-do well to make
other arrangements. It might even
be advisable to include the training
table in the list of changes.
