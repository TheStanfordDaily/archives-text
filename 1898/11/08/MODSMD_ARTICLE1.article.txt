# ALUMNI FOOTBALL RALLY.

### 
The Spirit of Pioneer Days Returns
to Awaken Dormant In
terest.
Alumni day yesterday was a great
success and the presence of so many
prominent graduates and former
students served to put the students
on their mettle and the result was
enthusiasm, pure and unmixed of
the sort that used to prevail in the
old pioneer days, when yelling was
a spontaneous outflow of over-bub
bling spirits.
Among those who were present
on the bleachers were: Scott Cal
houn, '95, \V. E. Stuart, 'Do, Jack
Sheehan, '95, Joe Hernhard, '96,
Green leaf, '97, Hindry, '97, and
Strohn, '98, C. M. Bradley, of the
Chronicle. Harrelson, '95, and
Frankenheimer, '95, assisted Coach
Cross and Captain Fisher in the
coaching.
In the evening at the football
"jolly-up" in Encina more alumni
showed up, among them Hugh
Brown, '96, W. J. Neidig, '96, Mason
Ross, '97, Beedy, '98, and Eaton, '95.
The alumni dropped in one by
one and each was in a pleasurable
state of rushing around seeing how
many others had arrived, and meet
ing new and old friends eager to
discuss football prospects. At the
bleachers a crowd of students had
assembled, waiting only for leader
ship to make their enthusiasm felt
on the field. Chris Bradley and
(ireenleaf, '97, both former yell
leaders, took charge of the rooting,
assisted by Yell Leaders Buscli,
Leiter and Gregory, and the cheer
ing was the most inspiring of the
year. The men were bunched sol
idly and yelled with a will. Not
too much time was spent in joshes.
If the students will mass each even
ing the yell leaders are only too
anxious to start the old and new
yells. The alumni have shown the
way, the students ha\e only to
congregate and show their enthus
iasm is not merely transient.
The football practice showed
signs of improvement. Erb and
Dole were out, and the former put
considerable ginger into the Sec
ond's play, whi'-h won for the team
the well-earned plaudits of the
bleachers. Dole did not play in
scrimmages, but will soon be able
to join the ranks. The Varsity
lacked the steam to score, after Sat
urday's hard game, and the Sec
and scored the only down after
Parkin's run down the field on a
fumble. Rice was the only Varsity
man who sprinted after the ball.
This only illustrates the necessity
of every man following the ball.
Touchdowns made from fumbles
and the like are sometimes called
flukes, but they are good football,
and the team that follows the ball
is the team which always profits
by the chances of the game. As
for following the ball, the men have
much to learn.
Clinton made one pretty run of
twenty yards and was tackled by
Parkin. Daggett scored a nice run
for the Second, breaking from the
pack and shaking off all tacklers
k-.\ ept Murphy, who downed the
i 'iter by one of the prettiest
t;i< <les lie has ever nnuli oil Hit'
gridiron.

Most of the time yesterday after
noon was spent in individual coach
ing, Coach Cross assisted by Hull,
Krankenheimer and Harrelson. The
men were somewhat listless and the
Second showed up decidedly better
than the Varsity. Captain Fisher
played fora few minutes only, but
showed speed and good form in
interference.
Following is the line-up:
Varsity. Second.
