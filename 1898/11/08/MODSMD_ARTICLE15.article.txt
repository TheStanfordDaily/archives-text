# "Dick" Culver's Calendar.
## 
### 
A "College Calendar, by a College
Man" is this unique one by 11. K.
Culver,' 99. A fair estimate of it
may be made by the elever cover
drawing, of which the Daily Palo
Alto's advertisement is a reduced
fac simile. The six drawings which
make up the body of the calendar
are in Mr. Culver's happy style of
caricature and hit off the various
phases of college life to perfection.
Though it might limit the sale if it
were credited to Stanford, there are
not a few who would have been
glad to see it not only a college cal
endar, but that of our alma mater.
Some of the drawings are not up
to the standard set by the cover,
which is inimitable. The college
girl is not flattered, though there is
one fair co-ed who pins flowers on
the jersey of a husky football hero.
This last picture is the most suc
cessful of all, aside from the cover.
Although the ideas are replete with
humor, the drawings in some in
stances are disappointing to those
who know Culver's full capabilities.
Still it is, on the whole, a success
ful effort and Stanford is to be con
gratulated that one of her students
possesses so much talent.
