### 
At eight the aftermath, which
went by the designation, the En
cina Jolly-up, was held in the
Encina Hall club-room and about
two hundred rooters had gathered
to show the old grade" that the
Stanford spirit had not been born
to die or languish unheard. 0. C.
Lieter, '99, president of the Encina
Club presided and called upon
Chris Bradley as the first speaker,
who summed up the football situa
tion, urging every man to undergo
a little self-sacrifice in order to get
out and help back the team. The
speaker was repeatedly cheered and
in closing led the assembly in the
Stanford yell.
Other speakers were called on
The following responded in a
happy vein: Calhoun, '95, Brown,
'96, Ross, 97, Neidig, '96, Hindry,
'97, Beedy, '98, Greenleaf, '97,
Bernhard, '96, Rice, '97. Stuart,'95,
and Erb, '01.
The whole assembly formed it
self into a committee to escort Cap
tain Fisher and Coach Cross to the
meeting, and both were borne in on
the shoulders of the enthusiasts to
voice their ?entiments. Captain
Fisher expressed his desire for
strong support from the student
body and the team, and gave way,
after repeated cheers, to Coach
Cross who met with a like cheer.
Coach stated the situation
plainly without mincing words,
and every player should realize at
once the earnestness with which lie
said it. In brief it was this:
With 70 suits out barely enough
men appear for practice for two
elevens.
The hour set for practice is 1
o'clock and the men do not appear
until 4:30 <>r later.
The men are listless on the field
and do not take coaching in the
proper spirit.
Promising freshman candidates
are no longer out and cannot be
persuaded to don suits.
We cannot build up a team un
less enough iiieii appear for prac
tice from which a choice may be
made.
I nless we have the men and the
proper spirit and the willingness
to work and receive coaching, we
■su-m ' ♦urn out a winning team.
i hat is ifm' situation, and everv
J man present swore to himself and

many audibly to do his best to
remedy 11»«* condition of affairs.
Several of the freshman players
will get out again. Beckett
will get out at once for the rest of
the season. Every man who has a
suit will be urged to get out. In
fact, if they do not. the hopes of the
team will be seriously impaired.
It was announced that W. 11.
Irwin would lead the yelling on
Thanksgiving and that Clemans.
'95, and Downing, '95, would spend
the last week of practice with the
team at Congress Springs.
