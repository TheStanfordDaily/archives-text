# VARSITY GAME LOST.
## Olympics Win Their First Game This Season From Stanford by a Score of 12 to 0. 
### 
A useless game so far as Varsity
training is concerned was won by
the Olympics by a score of 12 to 0.
The game was poorly attended
and while it did not result in a
financial loss, yet the poor exhibi
tion of the college game can only
result in a decrease of interest,
while the moral effect of a defeat is
not always toni*—especially if de
feats are common. The Varsity
has to face the danger of becoming
so hardened to defeat, so accus
tomed to being forced back over the
white lines to their goal, that a feel
ing of indifference, of don't-care-if
you-do-score, may become ground
into the team.
Stanford had played a hard game
Saturday—and with some credit to
the team. The men had been
given a practice Monday which was
not too severe, and the team in
good condition would have feared
nothing from another hard, bruis
ing game with Olympic. But
the men seemed all on the verge of
staleness, and spiritless play could
have been expected. But this does
not excuse high tackling, or failure
to get in the play.
Coach Cross in a signed inter
view has the following to say re
garding features of the game:
"Stanford's tackling was high,
terribly high, and spiritless. Time
upon time the opportunity to stop
a play was given, but the dash and
energy necessary were lacking.
.J list what the trouble was. 1 do not
know. There was an appearance,
certainly, of staleness in the work
of the men collectively. And yet it
seems extraordinary if it is so. The
work has been unusually light and
rather than being stale the team
should be just on edge.
"There is no particular individual
at fault. Everyone was responsi
ble, some perhaps more than others,
yet it must have been (dear to any
careful observer that no man on
the Stanford team was playing his
game. They had little chance to
show what they could accomplish
on the offense, for during the forty
minutes of play Captain Erskine's
team kept a firm hold of the ball
for thirty-five.
"While Olympic play was slow,
yet it was well executed. There
were few fumbles, and tlie interfer
ence. once formed, proved very ef
fective. Weak spots were found
everywhere in the cardinal rush
line. There seemed to be no spot
at which a gain could not be made,
if o icasion required. The center
was especially a point picked out
for attack, and always was found
vulnerable. Wilson was the strong
est of the three tackles who played
but he was boxed too often.
Neither Rice nor McFadden got
nto the defensive work as much as
they ought and both missed several
tackles when going down on kiek~.
"Taken as a whole the game must
be considered discouraging. There
is no doubt but that at present
Berkeley's team is materially
s r.»nger than Stanford's. Ne\t
Saturday's contest should serve to
give one a very fair idea of the

comparative strength of tlie teams, i
both individually and collectively.
•'Stanford was outplayed today at
every point; certainly Berkeley
eould do no worse, and I lo >k to see
her give Olympic the hardest tussle
of the year."
Erskine kicked off. Murphy was
soon forced to punt, and the Olym
pics began a line-hammering pro
cess, which carried the ball to our
ten-yard line. There the line held,
ami the ball went to Stanford on
downs. The backs could not gain,i
and a punt was again forced. Re
newing their offensive tactics of j
pounding the line, Olympics car
ried the ball to the live-vard-line, j
and Morse went over the line, leav- !
ing behind a five-yard streak of
players. The Olympic interference
was good, (ioal was kicked. Score
6-0.
Stanford in the remainder of the
half took the ball on downs, hut (lid
not come within striking distance
of goal.
In the second half Sheehy and j
Morse again starred, and Olympics
scored a touchdown on account of j
Stanford's weak defence. During
the whole game only occasionally j
did we have the ball, and then |
steady gains were not made. Mur-j
phy in the second half tried a field- J
goal from the twenty-yard line, and j
it was breath-holding in its close- j
ness to going between the poles, j
The final score was Olympics 12.
