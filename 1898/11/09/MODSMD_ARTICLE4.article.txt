### 
Next Monday evening in the

student in the American School of
Archeology at Athens, and a gradu
ate of Ann Arbor, will give her
popular lecture on "Mountaineer
ing in Tyrol and Switzerland."
under the auspices of the Class of
'99.
Mi ss Peek is probably the most
noted mountain climber of her sex,
and her achievements would cer
tainly rival those of others cele
brated in thesi'feats of endurance
and strength.
Miss Peek not only wears at her
belt the scalps of the noted peaks
of the Alps but the highest peaks of
this continent have fallen prey to
her zeal. She has set her foot upon
the summit of both Popocatcpet
and Orizaba. Miss Peck is the
first woman to climb Mt. Ori
zaba which is the highest
in North America, being 18.(500
feet above the sea. Of this achieve
ment. Garrett P. Serviss wrote in
the New York World'. "In reach
ing the summit of Orizaba Miss
Peck has performed a feat of en
durance unequalled, as far as I am
aware, by any woman. The dif
ficulty may be called atmospheric.
On the summit of the great Mexican
Volcano one has nearly half of the

earth's atmosphere helow his level.
\\ illl the heart heating wildly
and seeming at times ahout to stop
forever; with (belting-; gasping for
air and swallowing apparent
emptiness; with the limhs refusing
to answer the call of the will, and
the entire hodv trembling with ex
haustion; with the goal receding
like the will-o-the-wisp, with
the ears roaring with strange
noises, the head dizzy with uncon
trollable vertigo, and the stomach
in a condition of incessant revolt—
such is the physical state'which the
elimher of a lofty mountain must
experience and against whose con
sequences he must steel iiis will.
Now put a woman to that work and
let her succeed in it and you have
a picture of Miss Peck struggling
up the cone of Orizaba and at
length standing triumphant on the
summit."
Miss Peck is a charming lecturer
and has a pleasing style. The lec
ture will he illustrated bv stereop
ticon views of mountain scenery
which were taken by Miss Peck
while on her dangerous trips and
are a collection unique in them
selves. The management of the lec
ture is in the hands of the '99 class
officers.
