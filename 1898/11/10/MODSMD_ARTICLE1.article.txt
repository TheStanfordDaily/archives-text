# CARNOT SEMI-FINALS.
## Arguments Advanced by the Speakers at the First Session of the Debaters Held Last Evening. 
### 
To a chapel audience which was
not as large as it was enthusiastic,
Mr. W hi taker introduced Dr. How
ard last night as the chairman for
the first session of this year's Car
not semi-finals.
Dr. Howard opened by pointing
out the advantages of the present
intercollegiate debates over the for
mer oratorical contests. Better
questions are chosen, for one thing.
Continuing, he said:
"Since the institution of our in
tercollegiate debates with the Uni
versity of California certain trad
itions have arisen. One very proper
tradition is being established, and
that is that Stanford men should
show themselves capable of earnest
and hard work. This alone ought
in the end to lead to an even share
of the victories. But there is need
of a second tradition. Not only
should matter and strength be con
sidered, but also artistic form. It
is not enough that a subject be
sounded to its depths. No one
should attempt the art of discourse—
for it is an art —without being will
ing to live up to the principles
which underlie that art."
The history of the offering of the
Carnot medal was then sketched
and attention called to two changes
in this year's management of tbe
debate: the institution of semi
finals and the abandonment of in
structions to t he judges as to specific
points on which to make choice of
speakers.
The question for debate was:
"Resolved, That France is no longer
in danger of the establishment of a
military dictatorship." Professors
Newcomer. Spencer, and Fetter
acted as judges.
Miss T. L. Swanson, '99, opened
for the affirmative, speaking in a
self-possessed, clear and logical way
throughout. Her argument hinged
on four points: the growing ten
dency toward local self-government
in France, the growth of democratic
principles, the people's stand in the
1 )reyfus case, and the fact that there
seems to be no one who aspires to
become a dictator. Miss Swanson's
second speech lacked spontaneity.
Clarence King, '01, first for the
negative, dwelt upon economic con
ditions in France, and spoke of the
conservative moneyed aristocracy
as likely to be overridden bv the
restless mercantile element driving
France on to wars of conquest
which will make centralization im
perative and open the way fora
military loader. Though Mr. King
showed some force and considerable
spontaneity, especially in his sec
ond speech, be seemed not to be up
to his usual form.
('. A. Gray,' 99, second affirma
tive, cited the failure of attempts to
establish dictatorships since Na
poleon's time. Franco, he argued,
is not today in a position to wage
war for conquest. Should a man
of great ambition exist among
them he would not care to lead such
a people. Moreover, the spirit of
subservience is not in Franco. Mr.
(irav, though not excelling in anv

one lino, is self-possessed and logi
-1 oal and giv<>s promise of makingan
all-round spoaker.
Miss Anna Fraser, '00, charac
terized France as having a central
ized form of government with a
parliamentary exotic. France
stands, for many reasons cited, in
danger of throwing off the parlia
mentary excresenco and reverting
| to greater centralization than she
has known for yeais A dictator,
said the speaker, would promise the
people at large what they want —
peace, plenty and security —and
would give Paris what she wants,
some one to look up to and idolize.
Ln the spontaneity of her second
j speech, and the animated force of
both, Miss Fraser made up fora
certain lack of form which further
experience may do away with alto
gether.
Mr. J. E. Springer, '00, closed for
the negative, lie argued that the
French are not a political people,
j nor can they become so without a
lengthy process of evolution. Mean
i while, absolute monarchy is the
form to which France is accustomed,
i The majority of the people would
hail a dictator either with indiffer
| once or open approval.
In his speech Mr. Springer ex
hibited a dry humor, which on the
solid foundation of his serious logic,
was very effective, lie is new to
debating circles, is a man of un
doubted force, but at present lacks
much that goes to make up all
round good form.
