### 
The foot bull song-book for this
year, which the Executive Commit
tee of the Associated Students lias
been working up for some time, was
yesterday given to the printers, the
Stanley-Taylor Company of San
Francisco, and will be out in a few
days. Nearly all the songs of last
year are to be republished. Among
the new productions is one by
(ieo. H. Yost, '99, "A Typical Song
of a Berkeleyite," which is a clever
parody on ''A Typical Tune of Zan
zibar," is particularly catchy. Every
student should provide himself with
a copy before the rally next week.
