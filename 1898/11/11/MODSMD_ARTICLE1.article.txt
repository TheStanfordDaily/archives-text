# STANFORD EXTENSION.
## Academy of History, Economics, and Social Science to be Established in San Francisco. 
### 
As was recently noted, the Uni
versity authorities have definitely
decided to utilize Mrs. Stanford's
handsome San Francisco residence
as an annex to Stanford University.
The organization of the institution
is fully matured in the minds of
those who have undertaken the
task of planning for it.and nothing
now stands in the way of the actual
establishment of it hut a thorough
financial hasis which will come
with the gradual improvement in
the general financial conditions of
the University.
With the residence as its home,
there is to he established the Stan
ford Academy of History, Econ
omics, and Social Science. Such an
Academy was conceived in the
minds of President Jordan and Pro
fessor George Elliott Howard, head
of the History department, early in
1897 and immediately after the
conveyance of the residence to the
hoard of trustees of the University
hy Mrs.Stanford. Professor Howard,
in an interview with President Jor
dan, outlined orally a plan for use
of the building. This plan, as later
carefully elaborated and reduced to
writing, was adopted by Mrs. Stan
ford and conveyed in a formal in
strument to the board of trustees
in May of the same year.
In a letter transmitting to Presi
dent Jordan the first written draft
of his suggestion, dated February
12. 15 ( .)7, Professor Howard thus
refers to the work which such an
institution could find to do: "Its
work as an'extension college' would
be concerned mainly with those
questions upon whose wise solution
the improvement of society largely
depends. It would be in a high de
gree helpful to men. Its location
is advantageous, being in the center
of the chief civic life on the Coast
of Western America. At present
one-third of the people of California
are within a short radius of the
residence. Moreover, there is urgent
need here of advancing the scientific
study of history, domestic and pub
lie economy, and all that pertains
to good government and righteous
ness in social life."
Thus Professor Howard outlined
the scope and aims of the proposed
institution. He devoted much
study to the details of the organiza
tion and finally embodied there
suits in the following plan, which
lias been officially adopted: The
residence presented by Mrs. Stan
ford to the University is to become
the "Stanford Academy of History,
Economics and Social Science."
Such an academy may well suit
serve two main related purposes.
First, it may become the center of
the principal extension work of the
University, and thus constitute, in
reality, an affiliated college for the
promotion of those studies which
are at present of paramount inter
est to society. Second, it may pro
vide a home for an association
which will stimulate thought and
research along the same lines
throughout the state of the entire
region west of the Roekv Moun
tains. The following tentative pro

gram my serve to define more
clearly theeharaeter of the two pro
posed divisions of the academv:
I. The Extension Division—
Naturally the principal work of the
extension division of the academy
will be in the closely related depart
ments of economies, social science
and history. Everywhere in our
country there is urgent demand for
instruction in these subjects.
Especially is there a crying need of
it on the Pacific Slope, and San
Francisco, the chief center of civil
life in Western America, affords a
rare opportunity for effective work
on a large scale. Each year courses!
of instruction may be offered in :
domestic and public economy, !
finance, charities and corrections, I
municipal administration, ques
tions of labor and capital, and
in various branches of history, par
ticularly the history of California
and the Pacific Slope.
Hut the extension work need not
be restricted to this field alone !
Instruction in art, literature, ethics, j
education, physiology and hygiene
and other branches may be p"o- j
vided. Accordingly courses of lec
tures each year may be given repre
senting the following major groups:
First —History, parti jularly in
the general history of our own
country; in the history of industry,
art and institutions, and in the
history of the states of the Pacific
Slope.
Second — : Economics and social
science, embracing courses on
finance, labor and capital, railroad
transportation, charities and cor
rections. municipal problems, soci
ology. domestic and public econ
omy and similar topics.
Third—Miscellaneous courses in
art, literature, ethics, education
and other departments.
Fourth — Lectures, scientific
or popular by distinguished men
interested in the work and aims of
the academy.
Fifth —At Mrs. Stanford's express
desire, courses in Bible science and
ethical topics.
In connexion with the extension
division, which, it may be noted, is
to provide for courses in all de
partments of the University wish
ing to offer them, provision is to be
made for post-graduate study, so
that persons living in San Fran
cisco may register as candidates for
higher degrees.as at the University,
without the necessity of going to
Palo Alto. It is proposed to hold
sessions of the "seminaries" for
graduate work at the academy.
11. The Association Division. —
It is hoped that by inviting the co
operation of fellow-workers as mem
bers. the academy may become an
association which shall unite the
leading writers, teachers and stu
dents of history, economics and
social science throughout Western
America in one powerful organiza
tion. The association will com
bine three objects: First —to hold pe
riodical meetings for discussion, the
reading of scientific papers, criti
cism. and for personal intercourse;
second, to publish the results of in
vestigation in volumes and in serial
form; third, to collect a library.
Indeed, the creation of a library, to
be mainly a library of society pub-
lications from all parts of the world,
will be a loading object. Such a
library may be largely gathered
through exchange of publications.
The building will be admirably fit
ted t»» become the local habitation
of the association and to house it
large library.
Careful provision is made in the
plan for the government and man
agement of the academy in both
divisions; but the association divi
sion, in all that pertains to its lit
erary and scientific work, is to be
self-governing. The institution is
to be subject to the higher author
ities of the University, under the
control of an "administrative coun
cil"and a director. The necessary
corps of executive officers is also
provided for.
Professor Howard has been fore
most in planning for this increase
in the work and effectiveness of our
institution, and it is particularly
fitting that he should have been se
lected for the important position of
director of the academy. Professor
Howard graduated from the Uni
versity of Nebraska in IK7<>, and ob
tained his doctor's degree some years
later. His lirst two years of post
graduate work were spent in the
study of history and jurisprudence
in the Universities of Munich and
Paris. In 1ST!) he was appointed
professor of history in the University
of Nebraska, his alma mater, which
position he held until 181)1. During
the last six years of his residence
in Nebraska he was secretary of the
Nebraska State Horticultural So
ciety. When Stanford University
formed a faculty in IS9I, Dr. How
ard was the first one chosen after
Dr. Jordan. He was at once made
head of the Department of History,
which has always been one of the
strongest departments in the Uni
versity.
No professor at Stanford has ever
commanded a greater measure of
loyalty and admiration from the
students working under him.
When the acitderhy is to be started
is not yet definitely known. Ad
ditional room is now being added
to the University Museum, in which
will be ultimately placed the beauti
ful relics which are now carefully
preserved in the residence. Mrs.
Stanford has not yet announced
when this will be done. It may be
that circumstances will prevent the
opening of the academy even when
this is done. and. again, events may
so shape themselves as to enable a
beginning to be made in the work
before the residence is turned over
for occupancy. At all events, Pro
fessor Howard and President .Jor
dan are enthusiastic over the plans
and we may count on their starting
the institution at the earliest pos
sible moment.
As was recently noted, the Uni

versity of Nebraska in IK7<>, and ob
tained his doctor's degree some years
later. His lirst two years of post
graduate work were spent in the
study of history and jurisprudence
in the Universities of Munich and
Paris. In 1ST!) he was appointed
professor of history in the University
of Nebraska, his alma mater, which
position he held until 181)1. During
the last six years of his residence
in Nebraska he was secretary of the
Nebraska State Horticultural So
ciety. When Stanford University
formed a faculty in IS9I, Dr. How
ard was the first one chosen after
Dr. Jordan. He was at once made
head of the Department of History,
which has always been one of the
strongest departments in the Uni
versity.
No professor at Stanford has ever
commanded a greater measure of
loyalty and admiration from the
students working under him.
When the acitderhy is to be started
is not yet definitely known. Ad
ditional room is now being added
to the University Museum, in which
will be ultimately placed the beauti
ful relics which are now carefully
preserved in the residence. Mrs.
Stanford has not yet announced
when this will be done. It may be
that circumstances will prevent the
opening of the academy even when
this is done. and. again, events may
so shape themselves as to enable a
beginning to be made in the work
before the residence is turned over
for occupancy. At all events, Pro
fessor Howard and President .Jor
dan are enthusiastic over the plans
and we may count on their starting
the institution at the earliest pos
sible moment.
As was recently noted, the Uni
versity authorities have definitely
decided to utilize Mrs. Stanford's
handsome San Francisco residence
as an annex to Stanford University.
The organization of the institution
is fully matured in the minds of
those who have undertaken the
task of planning for it.and nothing
now stands in the way of the actual
establishment of it hut a thorough
financial hasis which will come
with the gradual improvement in
the general financial conditions of
the University.
With the residence as its home,
there is to he established the Stan
ford Academy of History, Econ
omics, and Social Science. Such an
Academy was conceived in the
minds of President Jordan and Pro
fessor George Elliott Howard, head
of the History department, early in
1897 and immediately after the
conveyance of the residence to the
hoard of trustees of the University
hy Mrs.Stanford. Professor Howard,
in an interview with President Jor
dan, outlined orally a plan for use
of the building. This plan, as later
carefully elaborated and reduced to
writing, was adopted by Mrs. Stan
ford and conveyed in a formal in
strument to the board of trustees
in May of the same year.
In a letter transmitting to Presi
dent Jordan the first written draft
of his suggestion, dated February
12. 15 ( .)7, Professor Howard thus
refers to the work which such an
institution could find to do: "Its
work as an'extension college' would
be concerned mainly with those
questions upon whose wise solution
the improvement of society largely
depends. It would be in a high de
gree helpful to men. Its location
is advantageous, being in the center
of the chief civic life on the Coast
of Western America. At present
one-third of the people of California
are within a short radius of the
residence. Moreover, there is urgent
need here of advancing the scientific
study of history, domestic and pub
lie economy, and all that pertains
to good government and righteous
ness in social life."
Thus Professor Howard outlined
the scope and aims of the proposed
institution. He devoted much
study to the details of the organiza
tion and finally embodied there
suits in the following plan, which
lias been officially adopted: The
residence presented by Mrs. Stan
ford to the University is to become
the "Stanford Academy of History,
Economics and Social Science."
Such an academy may well suit
serve two main related purposes.
First, it may become the center of
the principal extension work of the
University, and thus constitute, in
reality, an affiliated college for the
promotion of those studies which
are at present of paramount inter
est to society. Second, it may pro
vide a home for an association
which will stimulate thought and
research along the same lines
throughout the state of the entire
region west of the Roekv Moun
tains. The following tentative pro

gram my serve to define more
clearly theeharaeter of the two pro
posed divisions of the academv:
I. The Extension Division—
Naturally the principal work of the
extension division of the academy
will be in the closely related depart
ments of economies, social science
and history. Everywhere in our
country there is urgent demand for
instruction in these subjects.
Especially is there a crying need of
it on the Pacific Slope, and San
Francisco, the chief center of civil
life in Western America, affords a
rare opportunity for effective work
on a large scale. Each year courses!
of instruction may be offered in :
domestic and public economy, !
finance, charities and corrections, I
municipal administration, ques
tions of labor and capital, and
in various branches of history, par
ticularly the history of California
and the Pacific Slope.
Hut the extension work need not
be restricted to this field alone !
Instruction in art, literature, ethics, j
education, physiology and hygiene
and other branches may be p"o- j
vided. Accordingly courses of lec
tures each year may be given repre
senting the following major groups:
First —History, parti jularly in
the general history of our own
country; in the history of industry,
art and institutions, and in the
history of the states of the Pacific
Slope.
Second — : Economics and social
science, embracing courses on
finance, labor and capital, railroad
transportation, charities and cor
rections. municipal problems, soci
ology. domestic and public econ
omy and similar topics.
Third—Miscellaneous courses in
art, literature, ethics, education
and other departments.
Fourth — Lectures, scientific
or popular by distinguished men
interested in the work and aims of
the academy.
Fifth —At Mrs. Stanford's express
desire, courses in Bible science and
ethical topics.
In connexion with the extension
division, which, it may be noted, is
to provide for courses in all de
partments of the University wish
ing to offer them, provision is to be
made for post-graduate study, so
that persons living in San Fran
cisco may register as candidates for
higher degrees.as at the University,
without the necessity of going to
Palo Alto. It is proposed to hold
sessions of the "seminaries" for
graduate work at the academy.
11. The Association Division. —
It is hoped that by inviting the co
operation of fellow-workers as mem
bers. the academy may become an
association which shall unite the
leading writers, teachers and stu
dents of history, economics and
social science throughout Western
America in one powerful organiza
tion. The association will com
bine three objects: First —to hold pe
riodical meetings for discussion, the
reading of scientific papers, criti
cism. and for personal intercourse;
second, to publish the results of in
vestigation in volumes and in serial
form; third, to collect a library.
Indeed, the creation of a library, to
be mainly a library of society pub-
lications from all parts of the world,
will be a loading object. Such a
library may be largely gathered
through exchange of publications.
The building will be admirably fit
ted t»» become the local habitation
of the association and to house it
large library.
Careful provision is made in the
plan for the government and man
agement of the academy in both
divisions; but the association divi
sion, in all that pertains to its lit
erary and scientific work, is to be
self-governing. The institution is
to be subject to the higher author
ities of the University, under the
control of an "administrative coun
cil"and a director. The necessary
corps of executive officers is also
provided for.
Professor Howard has been fore
most in planning for this increase
in the work and effectiveness of our
institution, and it is particularly
fitting that he should have been se
lected for the important position of
director of the academy. Professor
Howard graduated from the Uni
versity of Nebraska in IK7<>, and ob
tained his doctor's degree some years
later. His lirst two years of post
graduate work were spent in the
study of history and jurisprudence
in the Universities of Munich and
Paris. In 1ST!) he was appointed
professor of history in the University
of Nebraska, his alma mater, which
position he held until 181)1. During
the last six years of his residence
in Nebraska he was secretary of the
Nebraska State Horticultural So
ciety. When Stanford University
formed a faculty in IS9I, Dr. How
ard was the first one chosen after
Dr. Jordan. He was at once made
head of the Department of History,
which has always been one of the
strongest departments in the Uni
versity.
No professor at Stanford has ever
commanded a greater measure of
loyalty and admiration from the
students working under him.
When the acitderhy is to be started
is not yet definitely known. Ad
ditional room is now being added
to the University Museum, in which
will be ultimately placed the beauti
ful relics which are now carefully
preserved in the residence. Mrs.
Stanford has not yet announced
when this will be done. It may be
that circumstances will prevent the
opening of the academy even when
this is done. and. again, events may
so shape themselves as to enable a
beginning to be made in the work
before the residence is turned over
for occupancy. At all events, Pro
fessor Howard and President .Jor
dan are enthusiastic over the plans
and we may count on their starting
the institution at the earliest pos
sible moment.
