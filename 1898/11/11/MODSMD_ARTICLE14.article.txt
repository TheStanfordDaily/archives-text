terviewed today as follows: "Some
years ago I gave my lecture on the
"Ascent of the Matterhorn" at
Lafayette. Ind.. and after the lec
ture was finished I met Miss Peck,
who was then connected with Pur
due College. She was interested in
the ascent and asked whether it
were possible fora woman. Later
she corresponded with me on the
subject and as she was rather ath
letic I encouraged her somewhat to
make the attempt, and gave her the
address of my guide. Her ascent
was successful and along with her
she took a fine camera and took
views from the mountain of the
beautiful scenery which surrounds
it. It is in these views, taken in
that mountain region that I am
particularly interested. Miss Peck
is a Michigan graduate, has been a
student in the Classical School in
Athens, and a professor in Smith
College. Of late she has been a
profession a 1 lecturer."
The lecture will be illustrated by
some of the most unique views ever
shown in the chapel and will be in
the nature of a quiet trip through
Tyrol and Switzerland, with

tiful scenery of Europe. While
