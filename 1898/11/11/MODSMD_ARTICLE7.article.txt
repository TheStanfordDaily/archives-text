Tiik elasjs officers of '99 have ar
ranged fora lecture under the aus
pices of the class on Monday even
ing in the chapel by Miss Annie S.
Peck, a university graduate and a
woman of classical attainments. It
becomes the duty of every senior to
help their officers in making the
lecture a success, inasmuch as they
will receive the benefit. The lecture
has been highly praised, and it is
well worth attending. Class patriot
ism demands a well-filled chapel
should greet Miss Peek on Monday
evening. In a university above all
means, a lecture by a university
woman should arouse interest.
