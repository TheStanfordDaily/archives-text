TO NEED GLASSES
is one thing; to be properly fitted is quite
another. Wt find a difference in the eyes in
about ONE-HAI.F the cases which come to us
lor glasses. This shows the necessity of having
each eye fitted independent of the other. If
you are a wearer ol glasses, undoubtedly they
need adjlisting—we do this without charge.
CHARGES MODERATE ALWAYS.
