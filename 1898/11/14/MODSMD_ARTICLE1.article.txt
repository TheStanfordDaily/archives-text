# TONIGHT'S PRACTICE.
## Both Varsity and Second Respond to the Coaches' Efforts and Play Snappy Ball. 
### 
Tonight's practice was above all
odds the best on the field this
season without exception. The men
played snappy ball, the grand
stand was aglow with enthusiasm,
and the band was out in force to
till in gaps and to add to the gen
eral interest of the play.
Assisting Coach Cross on the
field were Clemans, ".).'>, and Har
relson, Fisher was tried at
full back and his work was the best
he has done this year in interfer
ence and aggressive work. Rea
Smith was out at end, and played
a hard defensive game. Beckett
played guard on the second eleven,
and Oilman on the first and Pig-
Tow on the second had a merry
time in the center. Coach Cross
was out in his suit, playing against
the Varsity, and succeeded several
times in wrecking the play.
The Varsity line-up was Smith
and Rice, ends; Rusk and Wilson,
tackles; Blanchard and James,
guards; Oilman, center; Daggett
and Plate, half backs; Murphy,
quarter; Fisher, fvdl back.
The Second kicked off and the
Varsity took the ball down the
field by speedy work on tackles and
around the end, scoring a touch
down. Second kicked off and
Murphy ran in ten yards and
punted on next down.
Second's ball. Bidwell took the
ball and twisted loose from the
pack, going fifteen yards before
downed bv Murphy in a neat
tackle. Second commenced to plug
holes in the Varsity line, Parkin
bucking in good style until Varsity
was given the ball on a decision.
By good interference, and end
runs the Varsity kept the ball the
rest of the practice. Murphy
kicked a pretty field goal during
the game. Daggett and Plate both
ran the ends well, but Plate often
fails to bug his interference and to
cut in sharply. The Second did ex
cellent work and the Varsity made
several good stands on the defense.
The yelling was led by Chris
Bradley, who was down for the
day. Oarth Parker has returned
from home much improved. Bur
mister was on the field again this
evening. There are only three
more practices before the team goes
to the hills. The band will be out
every night and every one must
whoop it up on the bleachers.
