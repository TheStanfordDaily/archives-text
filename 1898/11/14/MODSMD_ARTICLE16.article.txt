# The 						Schott Concert.
## 
### 
Stanford circles may in the past
have seemed to lack in musical ap
preciation, l>ut Thursday night's
program brought out the audience
and elicited the appreciation it de
served. Herr Anton Schott was
ahlv assisted by Miss Ottilie
Schuecking of San Francisco and
Miss Florence (iordon, formerly of
Chicago, now of San Jose.
Herr Schott opened the program
with "Des Saengers Finch," a com
position which none hut a thorough
artist could render as lie rendered
it. After the sonorous tones of the
great tenor, which more than fill
our small chapel, the soprano voice
of Miss Gordon in an Arie from
"Don -Juan" sounded bird-like in
its extreme delicacy. Herr Schott
next sang "0 I)u mein holder
Abendstern" from 'Tannhaeuser,"
responding to a hearty encore with
"Wolfrau's Eulogy of Love," also
by Wagner.
Miss Ottilie Schuecking was the
accompanist of the evening. Able
and sympathetic in that line, she
seemed less at ease in singing,
though her second song, Schubert's
"Lindenbauni," was given with
taste and expression.
After three contrasting selections
from Schubert, two sentimental hits
followed by the joyous "Fruehlings
glaube," Schott favored the audi
ence with "Die Grenadiere" as an
encore.
Miss Gordon but strengthened
the favorable impression given bv
her first song in her rendering of
two songs from Schubert, "Der hist
die Rub," and, an encore, "Xeu
gierge."
The program ;*losed with three
selections from Schumann by Herr
Schott. who sang as an encore in
closing, "Die Ehre Gottes." IJeeth
ovcn."
