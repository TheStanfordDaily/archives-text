### 
On Friday evening two debates
were held in the chapel in the pre
liminary series of the Carnot con
test. Profess >r Lathrop was pre
siding oflicer. The attendance was
fairly large. In the first debate on
the question of suitability of the
ministerial «ystem of the I'nited
States for France, there were good
arguments advanced by both sides
a nd one or t wo of the speakers show
ed very good form. Quavh .especially
in his second speech was very good
and showed that he has power to
become a fir>t claws debater. The
second debate was on the more
general subject of the anti Semitic
agitation in France and owing to

tlie subject largely the arguments
advanced were less narrowly con
fined to exclusively French as
pects and the interest in the debate
was perhaps thereby increased for
the audience; Havden in this
debate was excellent and it was
evident to every one that he had
won the right to contest in the next
series. He was easy on the plat
form and his voice and choice
of words as well as his arguments
were excellent.
The attendance at the '"matinee"
Saturday was not so large as the
evening audiences but was appre
ciative. Prof. Murray' presided.
The first debate was on the ad
visability of maintaining the pre
sent system of local government in
France and the four speakers ex
hibited considerable interest in
their subject. In the second de
bate the balance was somewhat
destroyed by the fact there was only
one speaker on one of the sides.
The question had to do with the
position and powers of the French
president. Mr. English was the
best speaker of the afternoon. His
argument was evidently carefully
prepared. It was logically con
structed and forcibly delivered.
The general criticism to be made on
Saturday evening's debaters was
the lack of form. Some of the
speakers showed lack of preparation
but some had arguments that
would have recommended them to
the serious consideration of the
judges if their delivery had not
been so deficient.
At the close of the final debate of
the series, the judges retired and
after a deliberation of about twenty
minutes Professor Fetter reported
that four debaters had been chosen
as follows: Mr. English, Miss Era
ser. Mr. Hayden and Mr. Springer.
