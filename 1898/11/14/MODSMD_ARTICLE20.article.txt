						Judge's Criticism.

### 
Professor Spencer, who was one of
the judges in the try-outs for the
Carnot team, has written the fol
lowing general criticisms of the pre
liminaries at our request:
"One dislikes to speak of the de
fects shown in the Carnot prelim
inaries. because he must first of all
repeat the old story of general lack
of good form, of ungraceful hearing,
of stiff or choppy gestures, of occa
sional bad English, of more fre
quent had pronunciation of French,
of uncultivated voice, and the re
mainder of the familiar catalogue.
But if this has become, bv such
constant repetition, a disagreeable
subject, it is one that we must con
tinue to harp on until in some way,
the means of remedy are provided.
â€¢'in argumentation, as usual, a far
better showing was made. It is a
somewhat singular fact, however,
that one or two who had ease of
manner, pleasing address, and ap
parently great faculty of extcm pore
speech, should have been rejected
because they did not give evidence
of such argumentative power as
would warrant their selection. It
is much to he regretted, considering
where Stanford's weakness in de
bate lies, that men like these should
not take the necessary time for prep
aration.
''One other matter of special im
portance must be noted. Too manv
had memorized what they had to
say, and it was difficult to deter
mine from the brief speeches in re
buttal, how readily the speaker
could, in the emergencies that are
sure to come in the finals and in
the intercollegiate contest, give off
hand expression to their ideas.
Some regulation of their matter, if it
were possible, would enable judges
to estimate better the comparative
merits of the contestants in this es
sential particular.
