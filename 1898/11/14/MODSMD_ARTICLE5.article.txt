# FAVORS EXEMPTION.
## Editor of the Pasadena "News," a Member of the Legislature, Supports the Movement. 
### 
The following editorial favoring
the movement for exempting the
University from taxation appeared
in a recent issue of the Pasadena
Daily A r ews, and is nil the more
forcible and gratifying coming as it
does from the pen of Editor W. S.
Melick, assemblyman from the 70th
district:
"Stanford University will be be
fore the legislature at its next ses
sion with a proposition to exempt
its property from taxation. Last
session this was largely defeated be
cause the Stanford ranches from
which Tehama county derives much
of its support was included in the
exemption proposition. So now
they will ask for exemption only
on the property used for educational
purposes —the buildings, grounds,
personal property in the buildings,
etc. The university is interview
ing legislative nominees on this prop
osition. As it stands now the Neius
favors the idea. Stanford is doing
a great work and is a competitor of
the State University for which we
raise large amounts by taxation;
As Stanford is doing equal and like
work with the University of Cali
fornia it is a small matter in giving
her exemption from taxation when
we think of the good she is doing.
The writer supported the Stanford
amendment two years ago and will
do so again. We only regret that
it isn't possible that Throop Poly
tecnical Institute cannot be ex
empted also. But it is feared that
if such a proposition is adopted it
will throw down the bars too wide
and work out injuries elsewhere.
