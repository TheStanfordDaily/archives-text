Rev. Cyrus (i. Baldwin, ex-presi
dent of Pomona college, preached
in the chapel yesterday morning
upon "A Man's Estate," taking for
his text ''For thou hast made him
a little lower than the angels, and
hast crowned him with glory and
honor."
Mozart and Victor lingo lived
with the same surroundings as their
undistinguished countrymen, said
th(! minister. All men are created
in the image of (Jod and are influ
enced and developed by their en
vironment. Environments are
what touch the soul and move to
action, not mere surroundings.
Our surroundings do not become
environments until they play upon
our natures.
The speaker contrasted the queen
hee with the ordinary working hee
as an illustration of the different
results that mav come from the
same source. He also cited several
examples of persons who were ap
parently good for nothing, useless
and shiftless, heing suddenly
awakened to their true capacity hy
the touch of some environment, and
developing ;ill the powers of their
natures that had previously re
mained dormant. ' No man can
foretell the vision that shall unlock
his future any more than he can
paint the face today that he will
see for the first, time tomorrow."
We should not accuse any man
of heing irreligious, for we d.» not
know his true inner mind. When

lie recognizes that lie i> a child of
the Heavenly Father, lh.it is reli
gion; when In- is a wakened to love
and to Mtvi' his !♦*ll«»vv, that is
morality. An intlucnce must touch
us before it becomes an environ
ment. I» 111 unlike the qucu bee,
man is largely his own keeper ami
controls his own environments, ami
when lit; knows where good influ
ences exist, it is his duty to put
himself in touch with them.
