# Thanksgiving Seats.
## 
### 
The football managements of
Stanford and Berkeley met yester
day in San Francisco and arranged
for the seating of the two universi
ties at the Thanksgiving game.
Stanford secured the choice and
selected for her uncovered seats,
two sections on the Ringold street
side, near Eighth. These sections
were occupied by Berkeley last
year and are considered preferable
in not having a row of houses in
their rear. The covered section on
Eighth and those on the Harrison
street side which have not been
taken by the University Club will
be divided between the universities.
The seats of the University Club
are on the Harrison street sid.e
They are covered with canvass to
prevent the repetition of last year's
accident when the roof fell through.
The club will have its own en
trances and furnish its own ushers.
The standing room will be at both
ends of the field.
Ti :kets will be put on sale here
Thursday at the Postoffice At
first not more than five tickets will
be sold any one person. Tickets
can also be secured at Claborough,
Golcher & Co's. San Francisco.
