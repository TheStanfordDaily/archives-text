# Princeton Freshmen.

According to the New York
Herald a now system has been
adopted at Princeton of meeting
and controlling the evils which
annually make their appearance
with the advent of a Freshman
class. \\ ith the abolition of haz
ing and rushing the problem al
ways arises of how to make the
Freshmen feel themselves a part of
the University and vet to realize
their insignificance. Here is the
system which Princeton is reported
to have adopted:
"The Sophomore class of Prince
ton university has taken a sensi
ble and dignified course in resolving
to abolish the hazing of freshmen.
The horse play, the insults and
often the serious physical injury to
which freshmen have been sub
jected by time honored custom are
relics of tin s3 semi-barbaric days
when the college pump was the
general washroom and chapel was
held at (i a.m.
There is that about the Fresh
man however—a freshness, an in
nocence, a guilelessness, a peach
blowness—which if it is no longer
to be licked into shape must be
moulded into shape by hard and
fast rules. The Sophomore class
at Princeton has drawn up a set of
rules. If they are faithfully and
religiously observed the Sopho
mores bind themselves to cease all
hazing. Here is the new decalogue:
1. Thou shalt have none other
gods before Nassau.

'2. Thou shalt not make unto
i thee golf or bicycle trousers.
3. Thou shalt not wear duck or
i crash suits until after the first
Princeton-Harvard baseball game
| in the spring.
4. Observe the fedora hat to keep
it holy.
5. Honor the grand stand on the
'varsity field and keep tothe bleach
| ere.
(5. 1 hou shalt not wander from
thy rooms after !) p.m.
7. Thou shalt not smoke on the
8. Thou shalt not inhabit public
restaurants or barrooms.
5). Thou shalt not bear false wit
ness against upper classmen.
10. Thou shalt not covet the side
walks or path when upper classmen
pass by.
All this may seem silly and child
ish to the lay mind, but none but
the university bred can appreciate
what a prosperous nuisance a
Freshman really is unless he is
taken in hand and planed ami
sandpapered until all the veneer
comes off and the good solid wood
beneath it,, if it is there, is polished
into university finish.
This Princeton experiment of re
lining the Freshmen bv precept
rather than practice will be watched
with the greatest interest, not only
by the undergraduate bodies of the
country,but by learned faculties who
have been worn to shadows trying
to eliminate hazing from the college
curriculum.
