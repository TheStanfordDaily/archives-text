# A 						SPIRITED PRACTICE.
## Varsity and Second Team Fight Hard for Gains in This Afternoon's Practice. 
### 
This afternoon's practice was
characterized hy fierce, hard play
ing on the part of hoth teams. The
crisp Thanksgiving weather, the
enthusiasm of yesterday, have gin
gered up the teams wonderfully,
Hoth Varsity and second went into
the game with their fighting blood
up, and every inch of ground was
fought for.
Coach Cross had made several
changes in the line-up which inter
fered with team-work, but the re
sulting »haking-up made the prac
tice lively.
Biglow and Oilman changed
places, the latter playing on the
second. Cairns was given a try on
the Varsity, and Eaton played on
the Varsity side of the line against
Blanchard. Parker was out for
the first time since returning and
was given several rousing cheers
from the bleachers. Burmister play
ed only fora few minutes before
he was forced to retire. Fisher
played a few minutes in his usual
hard style, and was also forced to
leave the field. Geissler played
fullback on the Second, and made
some clever tackles. Blanchard on
the Second succeeded in ripping
things up, playing with more spirit
than usual. James was out but
did not go into the game.
The corps of coachers under Mr.
Cross was increased by the addition
of Downing, '95. Clemans was out
in his suit, and Harrelson was also
on the field. Fickert took charge
of the second and gingered up the
play considerably, the second
playing a hard steady game.
The second kicked off and the
Varsity started to work the ball
down the field, but a succession of
accidents made the play slow, and
before getting within scoring dis
tance the second took the ball.
Murphy's field-goals were unsuc
cessful mi account of poor passing,
and on the Varsity side fumbling
was frequent. Plate and Daggett
both scored long runs under good
interference. Near the close of the
practice the second had the ball in
Varsity territory, and were giving
the Varsity plenty to do to hold
them down.
