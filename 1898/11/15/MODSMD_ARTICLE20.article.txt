# Miss Peck's Lecture.
## 
### 
The small attendance of last
night's lecture can be accounted for
on the grounds of examinations,
pressure of work and the near ap
proach of the holidays. The few
persons present made up in en
thusiasm what they lacked in num
bers and left the chapel with the
satisfaction of having seen as fine a
series of stereoptieon slides as has
ever been shown at the University.
Professor Dudley in a few pleasant
remarks introduced the lecturer.
Miss Annie S. Peck of Boston, who,
before exhibiting any views, out
lined her plan of action in attack
ing the great snow peaks of the
All >s. The views were arranged in
the order in which a traveler would
usually see them, beginning with
scenes in the lower valleys of the
Tyrol, with quaint cottages and
green fields in the foreground, the
crags towering far above. Follow
ing these came views showing large
portions of the main ranges, includ
ing numerous minor mountains
and snowfields, the series gradually
working up to and culminating in
magnificent scenes of icy grandeur,
where the NVeisshorn, the Matter
horn, Mont Blanc and others of
equal fame reign supreme amid the
glaciers.
Miss Peck is conversant with the
history of the mountains she has
climbed and in describing her
journeys added frequent realistic
touches by pointing out the exact
spot where a certain party had
been swept down by an avalanche
into the unknown depths of a
crevasse, or where Dr. Whymper
had fallen a distance of two bun-'
dred feet bv bounding from rock to
rock, without being much the
worse for his descent. Perhaps
one of the most interesting if least
picturesque of the slides shown was
one representing a pair of worn-out
shoes and a battered canteen that
had been found on a glacier where
a party had been lost some time
before.
