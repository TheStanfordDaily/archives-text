The scheme which appears in
this issue, of roping off a certain
portion of the rooters section to serve [
as a nucleus for the vellers is a good
one. With a few hundred lusty Stan
ford fellows, in a compact body,the;
good old yell can be given with
greater effect than ever before. It
is the duty of every male student
who has a good voice which he is
not afraid of spoiling, to seethe
members of the committee and
make arrangements for seats in the
nucleus.
