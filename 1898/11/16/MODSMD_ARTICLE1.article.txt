# PLANS FOR THE RALLY.
## Arrangements that will Make the "Send-off" the Most Enthusiastic in the History of Stanford. 
### 
Tomorrow night in the chapel
will be given the final big rally to
the football men before they leave
for Congress Springs.
An opportunity will be given for
a final outburst of college spirit
and enthusiasm to show the foot
ball men that their work has been
appreciated, and that Stanford is
behind them to a man for tl.e suc
cess of the Thanksgiving game.
President Schwartz of the student
body is arranging the details of the
rally and promises one of the larg
est and most enthusiastic meetings
that the campus has yet seen.
The (ilee Club will be present in
a body and will lead the college
songs.
The lately organized companies
of "rooters," officered by their re
spective captains, will occupy the
further side of the chapel (reserved
for them). They will expand their
lungs in giving the players such a
send-off as they have never received
before.
The University Band will be out
in all its glory to aid in making
noise and music for the occasion.
Prominent members of the stu
dent body arid faculty will speak.
The chapel will be jammed. So
come early. Bring your song books
a nd "jolly up."
