"When we came into Manila the
people were in actual want and
while on guard duty in various
parts of the city since our entrance,
many cases of suffering have come
under our observation. In some
instances the rich had actually been
eating horse flesh and the poor had
been eating dogs and cats. A Span
ish priest invited three of us into
his house and after treating us to
wine apologized for not being
able to invite us to dinner, saying
there was scarcely anything to eat
in his house.
"We are now pretty comfortably
quartered in barracks in the city,
and on the whole it is not so bad
after five hard weeks in the field.
"It is like drinking fever to drink
the city water here. It comes from
the Pasig river which flows through
miles of swamp land before it
readies Manila. The only sure
way to keep well is to refrain from
drinking a drop of it. We can get
bottled lemonade, ginger ale, and
other drinkables from Hong Kong.
One must also exercise great care
in eating to escape cholera. As the
rat ions are not always adapted to
our needs, we buy what we lack.
"The Government cannot send
us ayvav any too soon to suit us.
We want to go home to our dear
native land and not await resurrec
tion day here among the savages.
I ha ve revelled in the beauties of the
Orient; I have seen a nation of peo
ple without half enough clothes on;
I have slept in the land of the mos
quito and the pugnacious an;t I
have enjoyed siestas when the mer
cury was trving to bump its head
against the top of the thermometer;
I have mingled with the haughty
Spaniard and the down-trodden
native, but let me repeat once more,
I have had enough.
'It is rumored that regulars are
to be brought here from Honolulu to
relieve us from duty. We do fer
vently pray that it may come to
pass.
"Ten Red Cross ladies arrived on
the last steamer to nurse the sick.
Two Stanford men are ill at this
time, "('het" Thomas is down with
malaria and Fry has typhoid.
"Some of the regiments are hav
ing a hard timeofit here with heavy
guard duty, but at present we are
having a snap nothing to guard
except our own barracks."
