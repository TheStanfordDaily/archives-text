Professor Ellwood P. Cubberley,
the present head of the Educational
department gave the usual Tues
day evening lecture this week. His
subject was the "Elementary School
of the Future."
Said Professor Cubberley: Of all
the different parts of the public
school system the elementary school
is the part that demands the most
solicitude from educators all over
the world. The elementary school
implies what is commonly called
the primary and grammar school,
and of these, the primary is the
more important, for about <>() per
cent, of the children of the United
States never attended any other
school.
To improve the elementary school
many obstacles will have to be over
come. The standard of proficiency
in force thirty years ago cannot be
used if the elementary schools of
America art; to meet the needs of the
coming century; for great changes
have taken place since that time.
Since 1S(>() steam and electricity
have wrought :i change not com
passed before in centuries. The re
sult has been the emancipation of
our people from the bondage of
meeting the demands of mere physic
al existence, and the sparing of an
increasing per cent, of our people
from drudgery for the creation of
the beautiful and ministry to cul
ture.
The elementary schools must
mold its pupils to meet the new
civilization. The child has been
deprived of all those forms of man
ual activity which were to him at
once his physical culture, a great
source of knowledge of the indus
tries of life, and a good form of
manual training. Bv the multi

plication of books and libraries be
gels much drill in acquiring knowl
edge of all kinds and almost no
practice in using it. Accordingly
one of the needs of the elementary
school is the introduction of a line
of what is known as manual train
ing.
Another means of expression
which is capable of doing much to
meet the changed conditions is good
work in drawing. This should be
taught as a form of expression by
which the child is to learn to com
municate his thoughts and feelings.
In both these branches, he may be
made to feel the keen pleasure of
creative effort, the thrill of real
production and the joy of spontane
ous activity, the lack of which in
our primary work is a curse to the
laboring element of America.
Another phase of instruction
which should be emphasized is na
ture study. This work introduces
the child not only to the world of
realities in which he lives but also
to the methods of discovery of sci
entific truths, methods which, when
applied to human affairs, will en
able him to grasp many a life prob
lem more intelligently.
A fourth feature of the work in
elementary schools should be close
ly correlated courses in literature
and history. History, closely
united with the work in literature
and reading, should begin in the
first grade and continue through
out the school course. We must
utilize the rich material locked up
in the early history of America and
in the lives of our national heroes,
and at a time when they appeal
most strongly to the child.
A fifth line of work which the
schools of the future must empha
size is physical trainingâ€”not ten
or fifteen minutes a day given to
class calisthenics, but physical
training directed by physical ex
perts with exercises adapted to both
class and individual needs. The
directors of physical training in the
cities should also be directors of the
children's sports, particularly on
Saturdays ' and during the long
summer vacations. The educa
tional value of play has not yet
been fully recognized, and the
moral dangers to bovs attendant
to undirected play on the streets,
while repeatedly pointed out, seems
never to have been capable of being
remedied. Here is great opportunity
for the public school, and the pub
lie school must improve.the oppor
tunity if it is to fulfill its mission.
It is the degree of emphasis to be
placed upon the formal drill sub
jects of language, mathematics,
writing, and the mechanics of read
ing, that the new education differs
from the old. The new education
considers these subjects as wholly
subordinate to the five subjects
which have been mentioned as
forming the rich content group of
the future school. The child of the
future must have a wider and a
richer training than the child of
the past. While allowing all credit
to the work of the elementary
school of ii generation or two ago,
we must realize that the training
that sufficed for those earlier con
ditions is not the education that
will meet the demands of the child
of the twentieth century.
