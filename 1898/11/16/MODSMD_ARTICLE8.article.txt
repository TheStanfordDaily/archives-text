Now that a definite and excellent
plan for the organization of our
yelling on Thanksgiving day has
been adopted, it remains for each
individual to carry out his own
part in the scheme. In previous
years, while the veiling section has
not been an absolute failure, it has
never reached the limit of its pos
sibilities, owing to the fact there
was mixed in it a considerable
number of those who did not ac
tively participate in the yelling.
In a nutshell, this year's plan is to
have the yelling section composed
entirely and solely of "rooters."
This can be done in only one way,
that is by the co-operation of every
man who has signified his intention
of being in the section. Never be
fore in her history has California
projected such an excellent system
of yelling, never before has she
achieved such excellent results. It
is indeed necessary that our plan
should work without a hitch if the
â€¢Stanford yell is to be heard as of
yore. If there is any one who
wishes to be in the yelling section
for the purpose of yelling, and who
has not been asked, let him apply
immediately to any one of the cap
tains whose names will be found in
another column. Now is the time
to pay the debt which every man
owes to his university. The l i;i
versit v needs yon, and now, if ever,
is the time for every Stanford man
to do his duty.
