# OUR COACH INTERVIEWED.
## Mr. Cross Gives an Account of the Work of the Team and the Program at Congress Springs. 
### 
Coach Cross lliis afternoon pave
11 m* following to a representative of
the Daily Palo Alto as a general
outline of the program to be carried
out at Congress Springs:
"in the first place, our idea in
going to the Springs is to improve
the physical condition of the men.
as well as to begin the polishing
process and the introduction of new
plays. We shall endeavor to de
velop these new plays as far as pos
sible, but we can't do all that we
should wish, owing to the short
time that remains. The season has
been extremely backward and there
is a great deal left to accomplish.
The condition of the men is not
such as to warrant a belief that
they can do much hard work. -Most
attention will be given to team
work, to making the line men ag
gressive and stronger at blocking,
to developing the interference and
strengthening the backs, and to
practice in punting, in formation
on kick-offs, and in getting down
on kicks. We shall also make a
thorough review of the rules so that
every man may be conversant with
them. Our general plan of battle
will be mapped out and given to
the players at the beginning of
next week.
"We shall breakfast regularly at
7:30 each morning and devote part
of the forenoon to signal practice.
Friday, Saturday, and Monday
afternoon, the teams will line up
for hard play. Tuesday will be
given up to drill in the signals and
in getting down on kicks. The
work on Wednesday will consist of
light signal practice in the morn
ing, after which the team will leave
to spend the night at some place as
yet undetermined."
When asked as to the practices
thus far, Mr. Cross said:
"During the past week, the prac
tice has been the best of the season
due perhaps, to the enthusiasm of
the bleachers and the presence of
the band. On the whole, the prac
tice of the season has been unsatis
factory, largely because of the pre
vailing sickness, mainly in the
form of malaria, and to the un
usual number of injuries. This
has been the most unhealthful sea
son in my experience for men in
t raining.
"In general, the material this
year is inferior to that which com
posed the team two years ago, but
there are some individual players,
who are better than the".•<» men.
The loss of our three linemen is
verv serious and occasions the weak
est place on the team. The tackles
and ends are as good, but the backs
are probably not so strong. The
team as a whole seems to lack that
aggressive spirit, which has so char
acterized the elevens of the past
two years. As things now stand,
our material is not so good as Berke
ley's. The ends are better and
the tackles about the same. Our
center trio is not so strong as that
of the IJ. C. eleven, and our backs
are somewhat weaker, but we are
stronger at quarter. Berkeley has
by long odds the strongest team

that I have ever seen over there,
the players manifesting more dash
and spirit, and working together
better and more effectively.
"1 look fora very close game on
Thanksgiving day, and feel confi
dent that whichever side wins will
have a hard struggle. We have
perhaps a fighting show, but I
really believe that the chances are
in favor of Berkeley, it is imposs
ible to tell how much improvement
will be noted in our men in the
next few days. There is a bare
probability that they may take a
wonderful brace, and, if they do
our chances will be correspond
ingly increased.
"Personally, i am in favor of
taking more men to the Springs
than have ever gone before, on ac
count of prevailing illness and the
necessity of having men enough
for two teams. Some players are
now in such shape that they ought
not to do more than signal practice
before the game."
Following are the men who will
be at the Springs: Fisher, Murphy,
Becklev, Erb, Plate, Clinton, Hill,
Dole, Daggett, Geissler, Downing,
Bidwell, Parkin, Freeman, Ander
son, Biglow, Oilman, Faris, James,
Blanchard, Eaton, Bentley, Emer
son, Beckett, Wilson, Rusk, Web
ber. McFadden, Nourse, Rice, Sell,
Parker, and Smith. Of these men,
Erb, Clinton, Emerson, Wilson, and
James have already gone. The
rest will leave at 0 o'clock tomorrow
morning.
