Tin-: last practice on the campus
lias been played apt in. Tomorrow
afternoon the Meld will In* empty
ami the hleachers silent. With
more or less of the rijrht spirit we
have cheered our team thronjrh the
season and we are finishing up our
part of the prelim inn lies in t lie true
old Stanford fashion. We will send
them off tomorrow with a noisy
mi spa hand then comes on that last

week. We will hear brief and lia/.y
reports of the progress of team work
and of the condition of the various
men. That week will he soon goneand
then again we shall see them —the
final Stanford Varsity for 189*. Ami
we will cheer and yell as we never
did before for our the
hardest battle that a Stanford eleven
ever fought for victory. The team
is one that will light and we hope
one that can win. There is no
doubt that U. ('. has the strongest
team she ever had—many say
even, the strongest team she ever
hopes to have. But after the kind
of work that our eleven has been
doing for the past week and with
the week of drill that is yet to come
we will oppose them to the best
eleven Berkeley can turn out with
confidence in the outcome. Fisher
and all his men have worked hard
this year, often under discouraging
conditions, and now as they go to
the hills feeling, as they must feel
after this week's enthusiasm, that
the heart of every Stanford man is
with them we predict that they will
come back victors.
