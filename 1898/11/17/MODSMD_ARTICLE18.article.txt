# Princeton Exploring Expedition.

### 
A year ago Professor Scott sent
I Messrs. Hatcher and Colhurn to
the unknown regions of Patagonia
to extend the explorations begun
by Messrs. Peterson and Beteher of
a former expedition. The first re
port of this second geological ex
pedition to South America was
made known Tuesday. The results
obtained surpass the most sanguine
expectations of Professor Scott and
the whole geological department.
The expedition, the report says,
explored the country inland and to
the northward fora distance of HOO
miles north of the Straits of
Magellan, adding much to our
knowledge of the country and dis
covering a large lake at the base of
the Andes, about thirty miles in
length, not previously reported.
In the region of this lake a new
and exceedingly rich locality for
vertebrate fossils was discovered
and many new facts were observed
bearing upon the geology of the
conn try.
In addition to a considerable col- i
lection of the arts and manufac
tures of the different tribes inhabit
ing these regions, a splendid series
of photographs was secured and a
fairly complete dictionary of the
Yangan language compiled. The
Yangans area tribeof Indians which
were considered by Darwin the
most degraded of mankind. Though
at one time they were quite nu
merous. they are rapidly becoming
extinct at the present time, hemmed
in as they are by more powerful
and warlike, tribes. The certain
early extinction of this race renders
all the more valuable a dictionary
of their language, ami the collection
of their songs, traditions, and the
like, which has been secured by the
expedition.
