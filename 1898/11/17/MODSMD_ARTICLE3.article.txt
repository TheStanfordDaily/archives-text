# Seats for the Rooters.
## 
### 
Yesterday the captains of the
rooting section sold 800 tickets for
the "nucleus." Forty tickets have
been reserved for the band, and 160
were sold today, making a total of
500 seats engaged for the yelling
section. Some tickets were bought
bv persons not intending to use
them. While these are good for Sec
tion W they will admit no one to
the "nucleus" but Stanford male
students and alumni.
