# LAST PRACTICE GOOD.
## Final Campus Game the Occasion of Spirited Play by the Teams and Enthusiastic Rooting. 
### 
This week's practices have shown
constant improvement. Today's
was the climax, and showed the
team on the road to Varsity form.
A week in the hills —and then the
'98 Varsity will appear. This after
noon the Varsity put up a strong
game against a strong team, in
which Code, Fickert, and Bandy
were great sources of strength. The
Varsity not only held them down,
but ran up a score of 11-0, Mur
phy dropping the ball neatly over
the bar, and Geissler going around
the end for the second score, which
Murphy converted into a goal.
On the bleachers every one
"jollied up." Irwin and Green
leaf, former yell leaders, assisted
the regular corps of yell instruct
ors, and the various captains scat
tered over the grand stand kept
their squads in a continuous state
of enthusiasm. The Co-eds as
sisted in the songs, and the band
was always willing to play popular
airs.
Code, Downing, Clemans, and
Frankenheimer were quick in as
sisting Mr. Cross and detecting the
faults of the players.
Captain Fisher was in his place
at fullback and went into the game
with his usual dash, and on the de
fensive was always near the downed
ball. Murphy punted in Varsity
form and his runs and a neat field
goal were the occasion of spontane
ous outbursts from the rooters,
which had a Thanksgiving tone.
Geissler showed up strong on the
Varsity, and his work in backing
up the line was of the Fisher order,
and his runs under Fisher's inter
ference were uniformly successful.
His work this week has made him
a Varsity possibilty. Dole played
fora few minutes and showed good
form with the ball Nourse and
Daggett both showed good speed.
The center men Blanchard,
Biglow, Freeman, Beckett and
Rusk played their best game of the
season, holding their opponents
down in good style. Few gains
were made through the two. Fick
ert on the second broke through
frequently and was strong in inter
ference. Bandy proved hi-* title as
the best center on the coast teams.
Middleman made a star tackle of
(Teissier.
Varsity kicked off. Hill made
ten yards. Second could not gain
through the line against Fisher's
and Geissler's strong defensive
work. Murphy ran in thirty from
a punt, under Geissler's interfer
ence. the ends getting down in fine
style, both nailing the man at the
same time. Dole made fifteen
around end. A blocked drop gave
second tbe bal 1.
Second punted. Fickert tackling
Murphy. A series of quick plays
by Geissler, Fisher and Busk,
brought the hall to the twenty-five
yard line and Murphy dropped it
over. Score 5-0.

ran fifteen through the center of
the throng. On a punt both ends

and finally the Varsity mustered,

through tin- line, and (Jeissler was
sent around for the touchdown.
Score 11 -0.
After the practice, Coach Cross
read the names of the Congress
Springs squad, and Captain Fisher
p-oposed three cheers for the alumni
coachers, which were given heart
ily. The rooters then burst
over the lines, and carried Coach
Cross, Captain Fisher, and the
whole team off the field hx an ex
press wagon, forming a triumphal
procession of yelling collegians led
by the Band.
