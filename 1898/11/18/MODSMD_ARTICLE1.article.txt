# THE
						RALLY.
## Last Night's Demonstration and Today "Send-off" the most Enthusiastic in Stanford's History. 
### 
Last night's rally was the most
successful affair of its kind that
has ever taken place in the history !
of Stanford. There was no end to j
the enthusiasm and college spirit.;
It properly culminated the week of
final practice on the campus.
Long before it was time for the
regular "jolly-up" to begin, the
chapel was crow.le I beyond the
hope of admitting the scores of en
thusiasts who were eager to get
within the walls of the building.
The rooting was better carried
out than ever before. The captains
all had their squads in the sections
reserved for them. The success of
the organization was complete. A
great deal, too, of the credit is due
to the good work of the old yell
leaders, Irwin and Greenleaf, who
were down for the occasion, and the
vigor of the collegians who had
charge of last evening's rooting.
President Schwartz of the Asso
ciated Students called the meeting
to order at 7:30 and introduced Dr.
Branner, acting president of the
University, who gave a talk which
was full of happy turns and yet
contained much good advice to the
students who will remain in town
after the game. Dr. Branner also
announced to the students that Mrs.
Stanford would be present at this
year's contest. Professor Fetter
was the next speaker. His address
was of the "jollying-up" kind and
contained much that was humorous
and witty. It then became the
turn of the football men to spiel.
Captain Fisher ex-plained the situa
tion and the difficulties which have
been met this year. He was fol
lowed by Coach Cross who empha
sized the fact that Stanford had a
task on her hands if she would
win. The effect of his talk was
that hard work for the remaining
days would in all probability bring
to Stanford another victory.
The members of the team were
next called on by the students who
forced the speakers to mount their
seats and express their ideas.
Trainer "Billy" McLeod was
brought to bis feet, as were
"Tommy" (.'ode, '95, Bandy and
Middlemas, the Olympic men who
did so much to strengthen last
night's second eleven. "Bill" Irwin
and "Chris" Bradley also responded
to the request of the students for
speeches.
During the progress of the "jolly
up," the Band and (ilee Club did
good work. The program con
cluded with an enthusiastic ren
dering of "Rush the Ball Along."
Once on the quad, the intensity
of feeling had to be vented. Long
lines of students, each man hold
ing to the man in front of him.
rushed all over the quad, shouting
and singing as they went. After
everyone was winded, fours were
formed and the big student turn
out moved toward the gridiron
where the bon-fire was started.
Co-eds filled the bleachers and
showed their enthusiasm in becom
ing wavs. When the lire blazed
up, the students circled around the
lire until songs and veils were be

gun on the bleachers. After the
college and class yells were given. l
and the songs were sung, the
students left the final scene of the |
most enthusiastic rally in Stan-j
ford's history, with the determina
tion to repeat the program in the
morning as a final send-off for the
tea m.
The "send off" given the team
this morning before their departure!
for Congress Springs was well ar
ranged and enthusiastically carried
out.
The team was scheduled to leave
Kncina at nine o'clock. By the
time its members reached the I
quad, the crowd, gathered to give a
final "send off" to the football men,!
was so dense that the buses could j
not make their way through. As
the buses slowed up, the horses
were unhooked and long ropes were
attached. To these over a hundred |
students drew tho wagon around'
the quad. It was labor gladfully
performed
Coach Cross and Captain Fisher
were put in a dump cart, and with
the cart at the head and two bus
loads of players all drawn by
students, a procession was formed
that proceeded several times around
the quad.
Opposite the entrance to the
quad the buses stopped and after
j giving the Stanford yell with a
| force and a volume seldom heard
! on the quad, the students called on
j Coach Cross fora speech. He
made a few brief remarks, in which
he spoke in glowing terms of the
work of the second eleven and
said that if Stanford won, a large
share of the victory belonged to
them.
After "Whats' the matter with
Cross" given with vim and spirit,
i and more yells from the assembled
j students, the buses made another
cirle around the quad. Then, with
j a quick change of "horses," and
j amid cheers from every side the
| team left for its six days sojourn
at Congress Springs.
Besides the men announced by
j Coach Cross, after last evening's
practice, the team was accompanie 1
to the Springs by Clemans, '1)5,
I Manager Prichard, '5)8, trainer Mc-
Leod and Bradley, ex-95).
