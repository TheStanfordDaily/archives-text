Mana<;kk Hyi>e of the Bookstore
states that a number of Stanford
Hags, made of silk bunting, with a
Barge white "S" in the center, and
of cardinal color, may be secured if
those wishing them will place their
orders at the Bookstore immedi
ately. Every student who can pos
sibly do so ought to provide him
self with one of these flags. No
-Stanfordite should go to the gaii e
without lots of cardinal.
