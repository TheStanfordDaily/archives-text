# Cornell Summer School.
## 
### 
The trustees of Cornell Univer
sity have taken action abolishing
j their "Summer School," as hereto
fore conducted, and have estab
i lished instead a regular university
session. Formerly, any member of
! the teaching staff could offer
I courses in the school and charge
! individual fees for such instruction.
Under this system, few prominent
1 professors gave courses, most of the
; work being done by young in
| structors.
The new legislation provides
that the trustees shall appoint the
teachers, preferably heads of de
partments, or, if they are unwilling
to serve, prominent men from other
institutions are to be brought in.
These instructors will receive a
fixed salary from the university,
and students are to be charged a
fee of $25, covering all work. The
primary object of the new school is
the instruction of high school
I teachers in special lines of work,
| and in the history and theory of
j education. Under no condition
lean the session be used to prepare
students for entrance.
