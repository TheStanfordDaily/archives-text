# Thanksgiving Choir.
## 
### 
Owing to the great amount of
enthusiasm displayed in football
the past week, Mr. Hyde has been
unable to get the choir together for
a good rehearsal of the Thanksgiv
ing service next Sunday. However,
he wishes all those who had any
connection with the choir, to be
present Sunday morning at 10:15,
fora short rehearsal.
