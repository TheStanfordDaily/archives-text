In the Press of Christ Church
New Zealand there was recently
an article by Sir Robert Stout con
cerning our University entitled
"A New but a Great University."
The article is opened by a quota
tion from Dr. Jordan to the students
in 1894:
"If the experiment of govern
ment by the people is to be success
ful, it is you. and such as you who
must make it so. The future of
the Republic must be in the hands
of the men and women of culture
and intelligence, of self-control,
and of self-resource, capable of tak
ing care of themselves and helping
others. If it falls not into such
hands, the Republic will have no
future. Wisdom and strength
must go lo the making of a nation.
There is no virture in democracy
as such, nothing in Americanism as
such, that will save us, if we are a
nation of weaklings and fools with
an aristocracy of knaves as our
masters."
"These pregnant words," says
Sir Robert, "Dr. Jordan, the presi
dent of the Leland Stanford Junior
University, addressed to the stu
dents of his university in 1N94.
They place in striking light the
function of a university in a De
mocracy. It is to the higher edu
cation we must look to redeem the
Democracy from the reproach under
which it lies in so many countries.
As was said by another able Amer
ican (Colonel T. \\ r . Higginson),
the value of a nation depends 'upon
the high-water mark of its educated
mind.' Perhaps it is this same
feeling that has induced so many
wealthy Americans to found and
lavishly endow educational institu
tions. The universities are the
most important institutions in
America. I propose to give a short
account of one of the most recently
established American universitiesâ€”
the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity."
Then follows a history of the
foundation of the University with
a sketch of Governor Stanford's
life. The management of the Uni
versity is discussed with particular
reference to the powers of the Presi
dent. Under the heading, Educa
tional Objects, the thing that most
attracts his attention is the catho
licity of the religious teaching as
expressed by the selection of chapel
speakers. The buildings and equip
ments are described and commented
upon.
Speaking of the methods in vogue
here, he says, "There is a breadth
and scope about the whole arrange
ments that place our efforts for the
higher education in New Zealand
in a very unfavorable light.'"
The article conelu les with a sug
gestion that travelling scholarships
be founded to allow young men of
New Zealand to attend Americin
colleges, and especially Stanford.
Throughout the article President
Jordan is extensively quoted as e
emplifying thee lucati >nil tend
