Erl) and Parkin.

Reports from Congress Springs
are encouraging and news is being
received almost hourly from various
sources as to the condition of the
men and their improvement in form.
The men are all well pleased with
the Springs, and with their quart
ers, and keep in the hest of spirits.
At present the coaching force con
sists of Downing, '95, Harrelson,
'95, Clemans, '93, to which Code,
'96, was added this morning.
Frankenheinier is soon to be at the
Springs. The alumni coaches see
that the Second gives the Varsity
good practice, while Coach Cross
keeps a watchful eye on the Var
sity, and no faulty plays can escape
the eyes of all these watchful critics.
The work at the Springs is de
voted to the two considerations of
getting the men into condition for
the big game, and to developing
team work. It is too late to de
velop individual play, and the most
the coaches expect to do in this re
gard is to remedy glaring faults.
The sick men are fast rounding
into form. Gilman is now able to
play. Erb played fora few min
utes Saturday afternoon. Wilson
is lively as a cricket, and if bis
knee continues to improve will be
in tolerably fine condition. Bur
mister is able to play in the scrim
mages fora short time, and seems
to be getting in fair condition.
Dole did some hard fast work Sat
urday. Emerson and MeFaddenarc
still on the side lines. Eddie .James
by the time of the game will be in
condition, it is hoped, fora hard
game. Fisher is over his staleness
and Parker is back in his old form.
Murphy is improving in physical
condition and punting.
The teams arrived Friday and
had a hard practice in the after

noon. Saturday morning they
had another hard practice, in which
the men went into the play with
dash and determination. Freeman
at center played all over the field,
breaking through the Second for
tackles and playing a .star game
both on offense and defence. His
shoulder which has been troubling
him this season was again injured,
but he hopes to be out again today
or tomorrow. Otherwise he is in
perfect condition.
In the afternoon signal practice,
the two teams again lined up for
two hours practice. Dole and
Clinton were the Varsity
halves, and showed good speed,
and fair condition. Fisher was at
full back. Hill and Plate were on
the Second. The crisp mountain
air made the game lively and both
teams showed considerable snap.
Downing and Clemans both were
in suits on the Second, and Fickert
played the guard's position against
Blanchard. The Varsity play was
good on the defense, and there were
no cold feet on going under the
heap. James did not line up, and
the Freshman guards were tried
for an interval.
Murphy is putting up good inter
ference as is Fisher, and the halves
also get in the game in improved
form, although as yet there is not
perfect machine work, owing to
changes in the line-up, Geissler and
Burmister substituting the first
pair of halves. Fisher is getting
up speed and has lost none of his
strength on the defense. Murphy
is practicing daily punting for his
contest with Kaarsburg. Up to
Ilea Smith's arrival Saturday even
ing Rice was filling his position at
end.
Sunday was spent in rest, and
Coach Cross and his squad walked
down to Saratoga where Rev. Mr.
Cross, a Yale graduate, held religi
ous services at the Congregational
Church. In the afternoon there was
a short signal practice for an hour,
and the men were left to their own
devices.
Everything at the Springs is ar
ranged fur the comfort of the men.
The lobby of the hotel is cheerful
with a large open fire around which
the men gather for whist or for
writing letters to the Varsity. A
golf club has been organized with a
solitary set of sticks, and Saturday
Captain Fisher was taken over the
links.
The football field, the men say,
would be more appropriate for tid
dly-winks, and is situated at the
foot of the hill from the hotel. An
imaginary prize of one dollar keeps
the youngsters of the neighborhood
busy throwing stones from the field.
The rain has made the field slow
for the backs, but it is excellent for
hard line-bucking.
The air is bracing and the wav
sirloin steaks disappear and with
them the profits of the manager
a marvel. Faris is especially well
pleased with the climate, and he
and liusk enjoy their little daily
practice against each other im
mensely.
The newspaper correspondents
are on the watch for new develop
ments and for indications which
point to Varsity improvement or
