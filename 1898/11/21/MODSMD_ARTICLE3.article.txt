A large congregation attended
the Thanksgiving services vaster
day morning in the chapel. The
pulpit and platform has been taste
fully decorated by the young ladies
of Madrono, under Miss Mac
gillivray's directions, with grape
leaves and hoquetsof huge chrysan
themums.
The service opened with an or
gan voluntary, followed by a
hymn and scripture readings by
Professor Murray and President
Jordan, after which Dr. Thoburn
offered prayer. Mrs. Starbuck
rendered a piano solo, and Mr.
Lewis Einerv gave a vocal solo,
â€¢'Ave Maria" with cello ohligato by
A. J. Van Kaathoven and piano
accompaniment by Mrs. Van
Kaathoven. Following another
hvmn, Dr. Little sang ii solo, and
Professor Murray read Whittier's
"My Psalm" and Watt's version of
the nineteenth psalm. A quar
tette consisting of Misses Chase
and Hyde, and Messrs. Little and
llvde, gave a selection and Pro
fessor Walter Miller then delivered
the address <>n "Thanksgiving,"
which was in substance as follows:
In a university community like
ours, the season of Thanksgiving
ought to come with peculiar force,
We look forward and backward,
and are often prone to discontent;
each year we plan for great things,
then do perhaps one-fourth of
them. Nevertheless, weaecomplish
much. No other college in the
land has so great a proportion of
voung people who know what they
want, and how to get it. Let us
be thankful for the Stanford spirit,
for the various and numerous
blessings that we constantly re

ceive. In our eagerness to got
what we have not, we often forget
all that we have. With John of
Antioch, let us form the habit of
always saying, "Glory to God for
all things."
The speaker then urged the
"habit" of thanksgiving. As we
are creatures of habit, the only way
to keep from forming bad habits is
to form good ones, of which one of
the most valuable is that of thanks
giving. It helps cheerfulness, over
coming our inborn tendency to com
plain and be miserable, increases
pleasure, and dispels anxiety, bring
ing the "Peace of God that passeth
all understanding." The more we
think upon the goodness of God,
the harder it is for us to do what
j He disapproves.
Thanksgiving is also a duty.
The man who omits the ordinary
"thank you" is put down as no
j gentleman. The Bible says give
| thanks for everything, even when
j hard to bear. Our University, in
its prosperity of the future, will be
j thankful for the dark days of its
history, when its friends were tried
and proved. Sorrow, when rightly
I borne, is often a means of strength
ening character. We should not
adopt Pope's adage that "whatever
I is, is right," nor should we go to
the other extreme and say that
everything is wrong, but we should
make our motto, ''Whatever is. we
must make the best of it." Good
| habits are not acquired uncon
sciouly, but by active, earnest en
deavor. We must begin and per
sist in practicing them, for practice
is as necessary in building habits
as in gaining skill in anything
| else. "Let us make life a continual
1 Thanksgiving: let us say 'Glory to
i God for all things.' "
At the close of the address Miss
Nella Rogers sang a solo, "0, Rest
in the Lord," and the services
closed with "America" bv the con
gregation.
