A timkly suggestion has been
made to the rooters at the game
next Thursday that they should
conserve the best part of their veil
ing powers until the Stanford team
comes on the field and the play
actually begins. In our eagerness
to outdo our rivals in the noisy
|>relude of josh yells, we are liable
to exhaust ourselves before the real
need arises for downright exertion.
When our team appears on the
field, when we si lute players and
coach; when the kick-offtakes place
â€”then every man must be in trim
to yell and shout with vim and
snap and energy, then and during
critical points in the play, is the
time when the Stanford spirit of
determination must be manifested
to its fullest extent. While the pre
liminary joshing is all very well
and i> a part of the performance,
let veli leaders and men be careful
not to overtax their strength. The
gates will be open several hours be
fore the game, but save your voices
ami i'ow until the real con
test eomes.
