# AT CONGRESS SPRINGS
## Men in Good Condition with Exception of Freeman who Shows Rapid Improvement. 
### 
Word was received by telephone
from Coach Cross, this evening re
garding affairs at Congress Springs.
The condition of Lou Freeman is
very much improved. He has dis
carded 11is siinand can use his
arm fairly well. It will be decided
tomorrow whether he will be able or
not to be put in at center. The men
are feeling well and are in good
spirits.
Two tine silk pennants, in cardi
nal, triangular in shape, sent by
the women of the University to
Coach Cross and Captain Fisher,
were received today. It is needless
to say that they were appreciated.
Tomorrow morning there will be
another signal practice. In the
afternoon the team will leave the
Springs to spend the night at some
place not yet determined on.
The final practice at the Springs
was held yesterday afternoon. The
Second eleven was strengthened by
Clemans, Downing, Code and Cross;
the Varsity was about the same as
will go into Thursday's game.
Altogether the practice was very
encouraging and although the Sec
ond put up a strong game it was
repeatedly put back by the rushes
of Fisher and Clinton. Murphy
is in the best of condition and
scored several long runs through
the scattered field. His punting is
improving and his tries at field
goals are becoming more accurate.
In the practice yesterday he
scored two goals against the Sec
ond. The Second scored a touch
down near the end of the practice,
Plate going through Wilson for
ten yards.
Following is the line-up:

The work of Burmister and Plate
on the Second was excellent.
Burmister pounded the center for
big gains while Plate directed his
attacks upon Wilson and Rusk.
With few exceptions the condi
tion of the men is good. The
change is continuing to have the
same good effect as at first upon
all and with another day's rest, a
strong team will appear at the
iranle. Parker has entirely recov
ered from his sickness and will be
able to put up a strong game.
Murphy is in the best condition
of anyone on the team and is ex
pected to play the game of his life
next Thursday.
Fisher in order to recover from
a wrenched ankle received in the
practice last Thursday evening,
has been taking light work
while at the Springs, lie is set

ting into the interference better
and bucks the line in strong style.
Wilson's knee luts greatly im
proved during bis lay off. Al
though he played ragged yesterday
when opposite "Phat" Downing,
he may be depended upon for great
defensive work Thursday.
Husk can always be counted on
for g;iins, but his defensive work is
not up to Wilson's. At present he
is suffering from a slight cold.
The coaches were well pleased
with the showing made in yester
day's practice which was the hard
est held this season.
