The University of Illinois, in
conjunction with the Peoria and
Eastern division of the Big Four
rote, has built and equipped a
dvnanometer car for experiments
on the comparative efficiency of
different types of locomotives, the
resistance of different trains at vari
ous speeds, etc. It is expected that
by means of this car much data of
great value to railroad engineers
will be obtained.
The University of Chicago may j
play games with two Eastern foot
ball teams instead of one. Besides
the game already scheduled with
the University of Pennsylvania, the
maroons may be matched with
Brown or Weslevan University,
New England colleges which rank
next to the big four Eastern uni
versities. This indicates a tendency
â€¢>n the part of the East to meet the
West in football.
