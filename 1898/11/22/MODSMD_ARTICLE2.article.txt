# Letter from Klondyke.
## 
### 
A letter has been received by a
Stanford student from Miss Emily
B. Parke, ex-'OO' who has been for
some months at Rampart City,
Klondyke. She has taken two
claims of value unknown as yet,
and meanwhile finds plenty work
of various kinds to do. She re
marks that there are more univer
sity men there than she ever saw
in a small place elsewhere, and
they are among the best workers,
too, taking hold bravely of all
kinds of work. Her Stanford pin
was a passport, not only among
college people, but in other ways.
It was that that enabled her to
land when most of the passengers
of the heavily indebted steaiper
were held on board with their
goods.
Miss Parke related a narrow es
cape from drowning which she had
recently. She ventured unwit
tingly upon boggy land, and it was
with the greatest difficulty that
she was rescued. She closed with
the hope that she would some day
return to complete her course at
Stanford.
