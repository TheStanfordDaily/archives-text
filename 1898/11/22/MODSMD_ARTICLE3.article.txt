# The
						Thanksgiving "Sequoia."
## 
### 
The special issue will be out to
morrow, and will be. essentially a
football number. The cover de
sign is unique and striking, and is
j the work of Mr. Adams, the editor
The editorials and "Arcadian
| Echoes" are all of the approaching
contest. The stories are by Louise
Culver and "Bert" Lougheed.
F. B. Riley has a clever little
sketch, ''The Supreme Moment."
L. MacF. Bowman who designed
the attractive poster in the
Registrar's window, contributes a
drawing and verse, that hits off to
perfection a co-ed's attitude toward
the "brutal j;ame." In the verse
there is a strong plea for the Stan
ford Spirit, by .J. R. Hamilton; ;i
prophesy by "Dick" Culver, and a
dainty triolet by E. \\*. Smith.
The usual departments occur, with
special reference, in the selections,
to football and the Thanksgiving
season. A limited number of extra
copies will be on sale at the Book
store and at Sinikins in Palo Alto
at the regular price, ten cents. |
There will be three excellent half
tone supplements; Captain Fisher,
this year's, and last year's twenty
eight-to-nothing team.
