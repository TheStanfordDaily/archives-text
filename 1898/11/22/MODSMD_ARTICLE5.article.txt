# TAX EXEMPTION.
## The
						Editor of the San Jose Mercury Advocates Freeing Stanford from its Burden. 
### 
Matters pertaining to the exemp
tion of the University from taxa
tion are progressing very satis
factorily. The interior press of the
State constantly contain favorable
comment on the movement and
there seems to be a disposition on
the part of the people of the State
generally to be heartily in favor of
it. From the San Jose Mercury
we clip the following editorial:
"Stanford University is entitled
to the same consideration from
California that Eastern States give
to their great universities, freedom
from the burden of taxation. The
faculty and student body of Stan
ford are working diligently to ac
complish this desired assistance
from the next Legislature. They
will surely meet with the success
which their cause warrants.
"The fostering of this great insti
tution of learning should be a
matter of pride to the people of this
State. They can show their appre
ciation of its value in no more fit
ting manner than to exempt it
from a tax which, it is alleged, ab
sorbs one-fourth of the entire
revenue of the Stanford estate
Those advocating the proposition
do not ask that the entire Stanford
estate be exempted from taxation,
but only that portion of it which is
actually used for school purposes.
California should not be behind
her sister States in doing every
thing possible to encourage and as
sist her great institutions of learn
ing.''
