# College Entrance Requirements.

### 
A paper entitled "College En
trance Requirements," prepared by
Talcott Williams, and read at the
last meeting of the Association of
Colleges and Preparatory Schools
of the Middle States and Maryland,
has been reprinted lately, together
with a number of statistical tables
of great value to those interested in
higher education. The tables are
culled from the records of Prince
ton, Yale, Harvard, Pennsylvania,
Amhcrt, Williams, and Michigan,
besides a large number of prepara
tory schools.
The aim of the paper is to show
that boys are fitted for college too
late, thus postponing their entrance
into college, a fact which dimin
ishes the number of men who con
tinue their college studies to the
end; and also that a like result
follows where the requirements are
raised in advance of the commun
ity. On this line Mr. Williams
has studied the records of the prin
cipal preparatory schools. At
Lawrenceville, where records are
kept of all who graduate at college,
the remarkable showing is made
that 97 percent of the boys of 1885—
1899 took their degrees —mainly at
Princeton. At Andover the per
centage is 60 per cent, and 27 per
cent at Exeter.
The Western universities are at
a disadvantage in this respect, since
the men come directly from the
high schools to the technical schools,
thus adding to tho stock of practi
tioners who are not really well
equipped for professional work.
Mr. Williams' paper closes with
a strong argument and appeal for
liberal endowment for our colleges,
in professorships, fellowships, and.
scholarships.
