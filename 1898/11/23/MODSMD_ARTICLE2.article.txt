# Girl's "Jolly-up."
## 
### 
College spirit here resides not all
with the young men, as the Stan
ford young women demonstrated
last night to their own and every
body else's entire satisfaction. From
the moment the girls gathered in
the Roble parlors to the disbanding
on the quad there was no lack of
that spirit which brings Thanks
giving victories.
Two hundred girls had not long
been engaged in song, speech and
yell, when it became apparent that
the Roble parlors were too small
for them. Out they filed to the
place where several Zetes were gal
lantly piling barrels fora fire. Now
massing to give yells or calls, and
now circling in a monster ring
around the blazing bonfire, they
evinced an en'husiasm which no
one present could withstand.
While the fire yet blazed at its
fullest height, the company marched
in column '"fours" formation to En
cina, where enough of a halt was
made to exchange yells with the
students gathered on the steps.
These needed only the concert sum
mons, "Come on, you boys!" to fall
in at the rear with their own yell
leaders Thus augmented the col
umn made for Encina gymnasium.
The young ladies then led
the way to the home of Dr.
Branuer. before which another halt
was called. The reassuring an
nouncement that he was "all right,
every time," brought the doctor
himself to tin; door, and elicited
from him a short but spirited
speech.
The column then moved on to
ward Lasuen Row, saluting tin
various fraternityhouses as it passed,
and winding up in the quad, from
where it disbanded to Roble,
Palo Alto, and the Row.
