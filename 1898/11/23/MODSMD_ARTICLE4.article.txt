# LAST PRACTICE.
## Team Left Congress Springs at 12:45 and Passed Through Palo Alto on 3:06 Train. 
### 
The la*t practice before the game
took place at training quarters this
morning. It was devotee! to signal
work and the new plays that the
team will use tomorrow. The work
of the men was good but not up to
the standard of yesterday afternoon,
when the players put up the best
performance of the season, going
through their signals with clock-like
regulation. ~
At 12:45, the Varsity left Con
gress Springs for the Pleasanton
Hotel, where the men will spend
the night. The team passed through
Palo Alto on the 3:06 train.
The condition of the uninjured
men is excellent and their spirits
are still good. They realize that
they have a good chance of win
ning and will play like demons.
The center position is yet uncer
tain. Freeman continues to im
prove hut it is feared he will not
be strong enough to enter the con
test. Whether he or Biglow will
be put against Cornish, will be de
termined in the morning.
