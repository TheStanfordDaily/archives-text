A hecknt Californian in a jubi
lant account of a practice game
says: "Then three more cheers were
given for the 'Glorious Blue and
Gold Sunset,' which just at this I
moment attracted some one's at
tention. The colors were so distinct
and held such complete possession
of the whole western sky, that it
was accepted a« a happy omen."
We don't think that the color of
the sky several days before the
game has any vital connection with
victory on Thanksgiving day but it
is interesting to note, sinco the Cal
ifoniian has called attention to the
matter that the blue and gold which
were indeed brilliant soon faded,
and in their place the heavens were
suffused with a more brilliant car
dinal. And so "the sun went down
in Stanford red," as Charlie Field
has sung. Possibly the cardinal
was not seen by Berkeley eyes.
Appearances vary with the point of
view. But we are willing to accept
the "happy omen."
