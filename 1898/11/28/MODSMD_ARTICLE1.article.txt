Thanksgiving day was not for
the cardinal and the blue and gold
in all its gaudiness came through
the Varsity game with an untarn
ished score of 22 to 0. California
last Thursday won the first inter
collegiate football game in her his
tory, and in the first half when
Kaarsburg after a punting battle
with Murphy vaulted over the Stan
ford goal line the U.C. rooters real
ized that they had scored the first
touchdown since 1895 when Ran
some and his men saved a defeat
by scoring a tie.
Captain Hall and his men won a
hard victory. The Stanford team
was clearly outclassed in almost
every department of the game, and
for the defeat no other reason can
he given or has been given by Stan
ford than that we met a better
team. The story is told in a few
words, and the essence of the game
consists in the fact that when Stan
ford had the ball it could not be
advanced for consistent gains, and
when U. C. had the pigskin Stan
ford could not stand against the
line plunges and end interference
of the clever quartette of Berkeley
backs.
Stanford went up against a team
in perfect physical condition with
a team in which few were in phys
ical shape fora sharp, bruising
contest, and whenever time was
called on injuries, in the majority
of cases a Stanford man would be
seen at the bottom of the heap.
Freeman substituted James in the
second half. Plate went in at Clin
ton's half. In the latter part of the
game Rice took Smith's end and
Hill went in at fullback when
Captain Fisher was carried off the
field.
Stanford lost a gritty game and
the stubborn defense put up by the
team won the admiration of every
spectator. Not once did a Stan
ford man give up fighting and they
met no reproach for unnecessary
roughness hut praise only for clean,
gentlemanly play. Coach Cross
inspired the men to play a clean,
hard game, and as Dr. Jordan
says, "Defeat under such circum
stances can be borne with good
grace." Every man did his best,
and some of the stands on the de
fense were marvelous, but for steady
work the team lacked unity and
strength.
Coach Cochran put in the field
one of the strongest teams Berkeley
has ever had, but not the strongest.
It was well trained in every phase
of the game and took advantage of
every fluctuation of the chances, re
serving its final energy when Stan
ford's goal was in danger. The
team was a unit and got in the
play quickly, but fumbled fre
quently, although not losing much

thereby. Smith,. Hall, Thane, and
Kaarsburg put up strong interfer
ence back of a good line which
Stanford could not break up, and
which would usually hit the end in
full motion, gaining a good distance
on every attempt.
Berkeley gave an exhibition of
consistent team work with star
work by Hall, Smith, and the ends
Craig and Womble. Stanford show
ed Fisher and Murphy in the thick
of the fi«rlit with not the strength to
back up their efforts. Captain!
Fisher led a forlorn hope, and
made a gallant fight against the
heaviest odds. He was in every
play and rallied the men on every
occasion to some brilliant work on
the defense. But the smashing
play of Berkeley drove on the ball,
and even he could not stand up
against it for the whole game and
an injured knee forced him from
the field in the second half. Mur
phy made the sensational run of
the day after the creditable stand
of the Varsity on their three yard
line, when they took the ball on
downs. His punt went straight up
in the air, and with it fell the Stan
ford heart, but breaking through
the center he caught it and was away
like a flash with a clear field. For
eighty yards he ran with Hall and
Smith in pursuit. Exhausted by
the fierce defensive work of the
previous downs, Murphy was
gradually forced into touch and
downed twenty yards from the U. C.
goal after the longest run seen in
an intercollegiate game. It was
Stanford's turn to yell, and the
sudden change seemingly from de
feat to victory gave jubilant tone
to the cheers which rose from the
Stanford section. Berkeley held
her breath. But we could not force
it over and Berkeley took the ball
fora punt. Victory then became
dubious indeed.
The crowd arrived early and was
well managed by an efficient corps
of ushers and policemen. By two
o'clock every one was in the grounds,
the rival bands had commenced
their .-.oncerts, and the rooters were
sending back and forth their his
toric taunts and slogans. To Stan
ford's "Give 'em the axe, the axe,
the axe! Right in the neck, the
neck, the neck!" yell, Berkeley re
plied "Your axe is dull, is dull, is
dull. Right in the edge, the edge,
the edge," and from the cardinal
rooting section came in answer,
Lusty blow, blow,
Always crow, crow,
Tutti frutti.

At 2:15 a cardinal streak seen in
the distance was the signal for an
ovation and Captain Fisher led his
men on the field and ran them
through a half signal practice,
neatly and in good form. Dr. Jor
dan on the side-lines was inveigled
into leading the Stanford yell, and
rousing cheers were given for Mrs.
Stanford who attended the game,
Mr. Timothy Hopkins, Coach Cross,
Captain Fisher and his team. \V. 11.
Irwin led the yelling battalion,
which was effectively organized, and
not once did he propose a yell which
was not heartily given.
Captain Hall and the U. C. team

soon after ran on the field with
stripes like the tiger, and Coach
Cochran and Cadwallader critically !
observed their signal practice, while
Stanford ga\e them the axe.
Officials Goodwin and Harvey
qnickly placed the men after Cap
tain Fisher won the toss and chose
the goal with the wind in our favor
Kaarsburg kicked off for Berke
ley. Murphy ran in five. After
trying the strength of the Berkeley
line Murphy punted to Kai.r.-burg
who fumbled without loss of ball.
Berkeley commenced to test our
line and in a couple of downs had
found a stiff resistance. On the
pass to fullback U. C. fumbled and
Dole took the ball. Fisher bucked
six, and Murphy punted thirty in
touch, and ran in Kaarsburg's free
kick fourteen, but the officials re
turned the ball on U. C.'s offside
play to the twenty-five-yard line,
where it was downed for Stanford.
Wilson gained two, Clinton one
and the ball was lost on downs.
Hall circled end for twenty and
Smith for the same, Rusk tackling
Hall. Murphv took the ball on a
fumble. Fisher struck the center
for three, and Clinton two. Rusk
was run with the ball for five. Ball
was lost on downs at center of field.
Hall bucked for five, and a con
tinuous succession of gains started.
Hall ran the end for twenty, and
bucks landed the ball on the three
yard line, where Stanford held their
rivals up on downs, Hall losing the
ball on a fumble. On the next play
Murphy made his sensational run.
A punting duel ensued and
Murphy was gaining five yards a
punt. With the ball on the ten
yard line Hall ran the end for fif
teen, and Kaarsburg punted, and
U. C. got the ball in the center of
the field on a fumble. Line-ham
mering and end-running brought
the ball a yard from the line and
Kaarsburg dove over for the first
five points. Kaarsburg failed at
goal. Score, 5-0.
Murphy kicked off, and after a
scrimmage Kaarsburg punted
twenty-five and Murphy gained five
on a return punt. Biglow fell on
the fumbled ball and the Stanford
backs failed to smash the Berkeley
line. The call of time found the
ball in the field.
The second half was a stubborn
struggle against the inevitable.
Murphy again kicked off and Hall
was downed by Wilson afteradash
' ing run of fifteen. Then end plays,
I tackle bucks, and center dives took
the ball well down the field, as
| sisted by twenty yards of penalty
for off-side play, when the line
| braced, stopped a high hurdle by
Kaarsburg, and were given the
| ball. A punt by Murphy and good
work by the ends sent the ball back
to center past the danger line. But
on the next series of smashing
plays, Stanford resistance was
weak, and straight through the
tackles and over the center the
many striped players galloped
fora second score in spite of the
desperate efforts of Fisher and the
I clever tackling of Murphy. Pringle
; carried the ball on a straight buck.
| Goal kicked. Score, 11-0.
The other two scores were made
similarly, Stanford playing on the
I defensive, fumbling whenever re

ceiving the ball, Whipple and
Pringle carrying the ball when the
line was crossed. Kaarsbnrg failed
on the last goal and the score
stood 22-0.
In the center the teams were not
very unequal, but Berkeley had a
shade the better. Biglow played a
steady game, and Blanchard and
James backed up by Fisher stopped
up many a center buck. James
tackled well and broke through the
line in good style. Freeman was
handicapped, but won his fourth
sweater in gritty style, tackling
well. Rusk and Wilson were not
in thei" best form and the majority
of plays were directed at them. The
ends, Smith and Parker, played the
game expected of them, but found
trouble getting through the Berke
ley interference which the line men
were unable to break up for them.
The backs handled their punts
shabbily, and interfered loosely on
punts. Dole tackled well; Clinton
and Plate, and Hill bore their share
of the line-backing while in the
game. Every man did his best.
Murphy outdid himself tackling,
and especially since he was severely
injured after receiving the first few
hard tackles. His runs after punts
were cut off by the deliberate off
side play of the Berkeley ends.

fumble. Fisher struck the center
for three, and Clinton two. Rusk
was run with the ball for five. Ball
was lost on downs at center of field.
Hall bucked for five, and a con
tinuous succession of gains started.
Hall ran the end for twenty, and
bucks landed the ball on the three
yard line, where Stanford held their
rivals up on downs, Hall losing the
ball on a fumble. On the next play
Murphy made his sensational run.
A punting duel ensued and
Murphy was gaining five yards a
punt. With the ball on the ten
yard line Hall ran the end for fif
teen, and Kaarsburg punted, and
U. C. got the ball in the center of
the field on a fumble. Line-ham
mering and end-running brought
the ball a yard from the line and
Kaarsburg dove over for the first
five points. Kaarsburg failed at
goal. Score, 5-0.
Murphy kicked off, and after a
scrimmage Kaarsburg punted
twenty-five and Murphy gained five
on a return punt. Biglow fell on
the fumbled ball and the Stanford
backs failed to smash the Berkeley
line. The call of time found the
ball in the field.
The second half was a stubborn
struggle against the inevitable.
Murphy again kicked off and Hall
was downed by Wilson afteradash
' ing run of fifteen. Then end plays,
I tackle bucks, and center dives took
the ball well down the field, as
| sisted by twenty yards of penalty
for off-side play, when the line
| braced, stopped a high hurdle by
Kaarsburg, and were given the
| ball. A punt by Murphy and good
work by the ends sent the ball back
to center past the danger line. But
on the next series of smashing
plays, Stanford resistance was
weak, and straight through the
tackles and over the center the
many striped players galloped
fora second score in spite of the
desperate efforts of Fisher and the
I clever tackling of Murphy. Pringle
; carried the ball on a straight buck.
| Goal kicked. Score, 11-0.
The other two scores were made
similarly, Stanford playing on the
I defensive, fumbling whenever re

ceiving the ball, Whipple and
Pringle carrying the ball when the
line was crossed. Kaarsbnrg failed
on the last goal and the score
stood 22-0.
In the center the teams were not
very unequal, but Berkeley had a
shade the better. Biglow played a
steady game, and Blanchard and
James backed up by Fisher stopped
up many a center buck. James
tackled well and broke through the
line in good style. Freeman was
handicapped, but won his fourth
sweater in gritty style, tackling
well. Rusk and Wilson were not
in thei" best form and the majority
of plays were directed at them. The
ends, Smith and Parker, played the
game expected of them, but found
trouble getting through the Berke
ley interference which the line men
were unable to break up for them.
The backs handled their punts
shabbily, and interfered loosely on
punts. Dole tackled well; Clinton
and Plate, and Hill bore their share
of the line-backing while in the
game. Every man did his best.
Murphy outdid himself tackling,
and especially since he was severely
injured after receiving the first few
hard tackles. His runs after punts
were cut off by the deliberate off
side play of the Berkeley ends.

Thanksgiving day was not for
the cardinal and the blue and gold
in all its gaudiness came through
the Varsity game with an untarn
ished score of 22 to 0. California
last Thursday won the first inter
collegiate football game in her his
tory, and in the first half when
Kaarsburg after a punting battle
with Murphy vaulted over the Stan
ford goal line the U.C. rooters real
ized that they had scored the first
touchdown since 1895 when Ran
some and his men saved a defeat
by scoring a tie.
Captain Hall and his men won a
hard victory. The Stanford team
was clearly outclassed in almost
every department of the game, and
for the defeat no other reason can
he given or has been given by Stan
ford than that we met a better
team. The story is told in a few
words, and the essence of the game
consists in the fact that when Stan
ford had the ball it could not be
advanced for consistent gains, and
when U. C. had the pigskin Stan
ford could not stand against the
line plunges and end interference
of the clever quartette of Berkeley
backs.
Stanford went up against a team
in perfect physical condition with
a team in which few were in phys
ical shape fora sharp, bruising
contest, and whenever time was
called on injuries, in the majority
of cases a Stanford man would be
seen at the bottom of the heap.
Freeman substituted James in the
second half. Plate went in at Clin
ton's half. In the latter part of the
game Rice took Smith's end and
Hill went in at fullback when
Captain Fisher was carried off the
field.
Stanford lost a gritty game and
the stubborn defense put up by the
team won the admiration of every
spectator. Not once did a Stan
ford man give up fighting and they
met no reproach for unnecessary
roughness hut praise only for clean,
gentlemanly play. Coach Cross
inspired the men to play a clean,
hard game, and as Dr. Jordan
says, "Defeat under such circum
stances can be borne with good
grace." Every man did his best,
and some of the stands on the de
fense were marvelous, but for steady
work the team lacked unity and
strength.
Coach Cochran put in the field
one of the strongest teams Berkeley
has ever had, but not the strongest.
It was well trained in every phase
of the game and took advantage of
every fluctuation of the chances, re
serving its final energy when Stan
ford's goal was in danger. The
team was a unit and got in the
play quickly, but fumbled fre
quently, although not losing much

thereby. Smith,. Hall, Thane, and
Kaarsburg put up strong interfer
ence back of a good line which
Stanford could not break up, and
which would usually hit the end in
full motion, gaining a good distance
on every attempt.
Berkeley gave an exhibition of
consistent team work with star
work by Hall, Smith, and the ends
Craig and Womble. Stanford show
ed Fisher and Murphy in the thick
of the fi«rlit with not the strength to
back up their efforts. Captain!
Fisher led a forlorn hope, and
made a gallant fight against the
heaviest odds. He was in every
play and rallied the men on every
occasion to some brilliant work on
the defense. But the smashing
play of Berkeley drove on the ball,
and even he could not stand up
against it for the whole game and
an injured knee forced him from
the field in the second half. Mur
phy made the sensational run of
the day after the creditable stand
of the Varsity on their three yard
line, when they took the ball on
downs. His punt went straight up
in the air, and with it fell the Stan
ford heart, but breaking through
the center he caught it and was away
like a flash with a clear field. For
eighty yards he ran with Hall and
Smith in pursuit. Exhausted by
the fierce defensive work of the
previous downs, Murphy was
gradually forced into touch and
downed twenty yards from the U. C.
goal after the longest run seen in
an intercollegiate game. It was
Stanford's turn to yell, and the
sudden change seemingly from de
feat to victory gave jubilant tone
to the cheers which rose from the
Stanford section. Berkeley held
her breath. But we could not force
it over and Berkeley took the ball
fora punt. Victory then became
dubious indeed.
The crowd arrived early and was
well managed by an efficient corps
of ushers and policemen. By two
o'clock every one was in the grounds,
the rival bands had commenced
their .-.oncerts, and the rooters were
sending back and forth their his
toric taunts and slogans. To Stan
ford's "Give 'em the axe, the axe,
the axe! Right in the neck, the
neck, the neck!" yell, Berkeley re
plied "Your axe is dull, is dull, is
dull. Right in the edge, the edge,
the edge," and from the cardinal
rooting section came in answer,
Lusty blow, blow,
Always crow, crow,
Tutti frutti.

At 2:15 a cardinal streak seen in
the distance was the signal for an
ovation and Captain Fisher led his
men on the field and ran them
through a half signal practice,
neatly and in good form. Dr. Jor
dan on the side-lines was inveigled
into leading the Stanford yell, and
rousing cheers were given for Mrs.
Stanford who attended the game,
Mr. Timothy Hopkins, Coach Cross,
Captain Fisher and his team. \V. 11.
Irwin led the yelling battalion,
which was effectively organized, and
not once did he propose a yell which
was not heartily given.
Captain Hall and the U. C. team

soon after ran on the field with
stripes like the tiger, and Coach
Cochran and Cadwallader critically !
observed their signal practice, while
Stanford ga\e them the axe.
Officials Goodwin and Harvey
qnickly placed the men after Cap
tain Fisher won the toss and chose
the goal with the wind in our favor
Kaarsburg kicked off for Berke
ley. Murphy ran in five. After
trying the strength of the Berkeley
line Murphy punted to Kai.r.-burg
who fumbled without loss of ball.
Berkeley commenced to test our
line and in a couple of downs had
found a stiff resistance. On the
pass to fullback U. C. fumbled and
Dole took the ball. Fisher bucked
six, and Murphy punted thirty in
touch, and ran in Kaarsburg's free
kick fourteen, but the officials re
turned the ball on U. C.'s offside
play to the twenty-five-yard line,
where it was downed for Stanford.
Wilson gained two, Clinton one
and the ball was lost on downs.
Hall circled end for twenty and
Smith for the same, Rusk tackling
Hall. Murphv took the ball on a
