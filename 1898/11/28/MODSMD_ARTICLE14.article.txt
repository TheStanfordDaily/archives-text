# The 						Reno Trip.
## 
### 
The trip of the second team to
Reno to play the University of
Nevada was a flat failure from the
standpoint of football and a most
pleasing success socially. Arrange
ments not having been definitely
made before Thanksgiving, it was
almost impossible to get eleven
men together to leave Friday night
and the team that went contained
few of the second eleven men and
two who had not even been out
this season.
At the last minute before the
game the Reno captain and mana
ger objected to Hill on the grounds
that he was a Varsity man. He
was not allowed to play the first
half and Bidwell took his place at
fullback. Nourse and Daggett were
in halfback positions. Cooper
played quarter and did splendid
work on the defensive. The center
men were Gilman, Cox and Cant
well, Bentlev and Lougheed played
tackles. The ends, McFadden and
Beckley played the best game for
the second and were able to stop
all trick plays. Lougheed was laid
off, forcing the team to play the
second half with ten men. When
Cantwell was forced to the side
lines the nine men left were put
against heavy odds for the last ten
minutes. Thirty minute halves
were played. The result was the
fatal score of 22 to 0. The Reno
team is a good one this year. It
played with snap and spirit. The
Freshman Glee which all attended
was a most pleasant feature of the
trip. Manager Prichard also en
joyed a fine skate on the pond.
The weather was extremely cold
and invigorating.
