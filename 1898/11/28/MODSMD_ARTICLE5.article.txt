Stanford has met the first foot
hall defeat, by the University of
California in the years that the
.sport has been played on the Coast.
Defeat was strange and bard to
bear, but the team, coach, captain,
and student body have accepted it
more or less gracefully. The Stan-*
ford team was beaten by a better
team, and solely for that reason.
The whole season has been marked
with great odds, against which
Coach Cross and Captain Fisher
have had to contend, in weaker
material and in unusual health
conditions, but the team which
went against Berkeley was the best
the student body could turn out.
and it represented the cardinal as
bravely and as faithfully as any
Stanford team ever did o.r ever will
The stand that our team made
against a superior force will always
be remembered as an example of
plucky, unflinching, up-hill light
ing. The University of California
lias for seven years been working
for this victory and it stands as a
reward fora hard struggle on their
jwjj't. Their team this year was
one of the strongest teams the col
lege has turned out and it was in
perfect condition and a unit in
jfceam work.
The Stanford team and student
bodv have accepted the defeat, and
will redouble their efforts to regain
the ehampionship. The sportsman
ship lias been unquestioned, and
the clean, gentlemanly game played
•b\- tin men makes the defeat easier
to bear. The published report that
Stanford was dbsitisfied with
Coach Cross in view of the de

feat, when after his 20-0 vic
tory two years ago we
sang 11is name in paeans of joy
lias no basis in fact and is an un
warranted attack upon our sports
manship. In victory or in defeat
Stanford does not change her alle
giance to a tried friend, and Coach
Cross has not lost one iota of his
popularity at Stanford since the de
feat of Thursday. The defeat is
not an arraignment of our athletic
policy and any attempt to institute
an agitation at the present time,
such as is reported to have been be
gun by certain San Francisco al
umni, seems very unfortunate and
inexpedient.
