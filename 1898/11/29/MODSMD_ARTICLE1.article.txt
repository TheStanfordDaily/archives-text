# NEWS FROM MANILA.
## J. H. Stewart Sends the Latest Word Concerning the Stanford Men at Manila. 
### 
The following letter from .J. H.
Stewart from Manila, under date of:
October 24, lias just been received
I>y J. T. Nourse, '00.
Life here is growing more and
more monotonous. Two battalions
of our regiment are quartered at
the foot of a suspension bridge,
which crosses the Pasig river, and
our battalion is quartered about
three hundred yards down the
river on the same side. We haver
good barricks with good baths, cots '
to sleep on, etc. We are policing
the main business part of Manila
(Escolta street) and the division
hospital. We mount nearly one
hundred guards per day. Quite a
number of the boys are sick so
that we have to go on guard about
every six days. Among the sick
from our company are Fry, Frum- ;
bauer, Chet Thomas (Ist sergeant),
and Corbusier (quartermaster ser- 1
geant). Thei" ailments are typhoid
and malaria fever. Wrigley and i
Leavitt are at the hospital nursing
them back to health. They are,
recovering slowly. Fry was at the j
pointof death once with the typhoid
fever as several others have been,
but he was brought back again by
the tireless attention of Leavitt and
Wrigley. Wardall and Reese were
sent home.
We have been kept in quarters
for the last two days and held in
readiness to leave the city at a
moments notice, and go against
the natives, who seem to know no
better than to trifle with the
Americans. If we go against them
vou may rest assured that we will
give them a good time. The
Montana regiment passed our
barracks a few minutes ago going
up the river.
The Utah battery left the city
yesterday and the other artillery
companies are held in readiness. I
think a little hostile demonstration
on our part is all that is necessary
to give the Filippinoes ' cold feet,"
but if they do 110 get "cold feet" we
will give them something worse. It
rains here about half the time, and
the other half the weather is very
threatening. We are supposed to
drill twice a, day, an hour in the
morning and a half hour in the
evening. Fortunately it rains al
most every evening, saving us a
great deal of exertion. Manila
cigars are good and cheap, so we
all smoke; not that we like smok
ing, but that it tends to kill germs.
We all drink a little, for this climate
seems to require it. We have not the
slightest idea when we will be re
turned home. Perhaps now that
they have us they will keep us as
long as possible.
This is a miserable country.
Evervbody else* seems to hate it worse
than I do and I hate it worse than
poison; in fact it is poisonous.
One can't drink the water without
getting the fever, and he can't en
ter a native house without getting
smallpox. Weare confined strictly
to quarters between eleven
a.m. and three p.m. We
must fall into bed at ten and get
out at five in the morning. If you

think we don't have a picnic re
gardless of all that you are mis
taken.
Charley Detrick was reduced to,
the ranks at his own request.
Grow and Dole are corporals now.!
They will make good "non-coms"
when they get a little experience.
Our "non-coms" of old are still with
us, but the majority are all right.
Our company has one good officer,
Seeley, second lieutenant.
We have several copies of the
Daily Palo Alto and two numbers
of the Sequoia, up to date. "Babe"
Burnett is in the Utah battery but
has applied fora transfer to our
company.
I will mail you a copy of one of
our soldier publication of Manila;
we have four or five of them up to
date. I will enclose a Mauser shell,
from which you will extract the
bullet and see the device of the
cruel Spaniard to make his missile
more deadly.
J. H.Stewart.
