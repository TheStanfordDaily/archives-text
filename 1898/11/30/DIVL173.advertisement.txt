TO NEED GLASSES
is one thing; to be properly fitted is quite
another. We find a difference in the eyes in
about ONE HALF the cases which come to us
for glasses. This shows the necessity of having
t.ach eye fitted independent of the other, li
you are a wearer of glasses, undoubtedly they
need adjusting—we do this without charge.
CHARGES MODERATE ALWAYS.
