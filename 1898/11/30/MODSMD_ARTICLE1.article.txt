# FAVOR TAX-EXEMPTION.
## Los Angeles "Times" and Southern Legislators Show a Progressive Spirit.

In addition to quoting quite
fully from the argument prepared
by the Tax-Exemption Club for
freeing the University from taxa
tion, the Los Angeles Times com
ments editorially on the matter in
a recent issue as follows:
"A movement has recently been
begun by the alumni and students
of Stanford University to have the
university exempted from taxation.
They have organized the "Stanford
University Tax-exemption Club,"
and a vigorous campaign is in pro
gress to secure such legislation as is
needed to accomplish the desired re
sult. In a circular prepared and
recently sent out by the executive
committee of the above-named club,
a strong argument in favor of ex
empting the university from taxa
tion is put forward."
"This argument is worthy of care
ful consideration by the legislature
If greater benefits to the public at
large are to be secured by exempt
ing the institution from taxation,
by all means let the tax be re
moved."
At a meeting of the legislators of
Southern California held in Los
Angeles on Monday last it was
agreed to favor the submission of a
constitutional amendtment to ex
empt from taxation the buildings
and grounds of the University, but
not any other property of the Stan
ford estate. Senator Simpson out
lined this proposition.
Thus it is seen that those who
are to decide this matter are already
heartilv with us.
