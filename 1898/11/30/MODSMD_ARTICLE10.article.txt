We are continually seeing refer
ences in the columns of our Cal
ifornia exchanges to the movement
to have our University exempted
from taxation and thus far none of
those which have come to our no
tice have taken a Stand against us.
All that seems to be necessary is a
determination on the part of the
students, alumni, and friends of the
University to carry the movement
to a successful issue. The vigor
with which the campaign was
opened has not been allowed to sub
side and we can confidently look
forward to favorable action by the
legislature. California is not going
to let pass unheeded this opportu
nity to aid our University in her
work.
Vet, although the outlook is en
couraging, no one should neglect
his share in the work. The meet
ings of California students held on
October I'.) were fruitful of results
by way of putting our representa
tives, Mr. Sheehan and Mr. Kees
ling, in touch with the candidates
for the legislature. Now that the
legislature is elected, there is the
better chance of effectively acquaint
ing its members with what i> de
sired and of using personal influence
with them. Therefore, this fact
should be car.'fully heeded by those
who can help, which is nearly every
one here, and nothing possible <>112
acconiplisment should be left un
done.
