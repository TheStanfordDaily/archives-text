Below are some extracts from a
letter written at Manila on October
15th by P. W. Corbusier to F. B.
Brad en, '99:
''This is a very poor place fora
white man to live in. All of our
soldiers are anxious to get home.
There is one thing, however, that 1
can say in favor of Manila—cigars-,
silks, and diamonds are very cheap.
This is not a pretty city, but it is
very interesting; there are many
churches and curious old buildings
here. Everywhere one goes he sees
American and Spanish soldiers.
We had heard that there were
many pretty women in Manila, but
my eyes have grown bloodshot
looking for them. The horses are
not larger than good sized Shetland
ponies. Sad to relate, we have no
horses. American horses, and es
pecially geldings, will not thrive in
this beastly climate. As it is now, an
average of three men are dying
every day. We are near the ceme
tery, and not a day passes that we
do not hear three volleys and the
beautiful notes of taps, the soldier's
last call. I will not say any more,
as I may be the next.
"Many is the night that the small
Stanford contingent gathers and dis
cusses the prospects for the Thanks
giving game. We know very little
of the line-up. but still we know
dear old Cardinal can not lose
Think of hearing the Stanford yell
away down here! We give it, and
with a will, too. .lust remember

that on Thanksgiving day there
will be a little crowd of us yelling
for dear old Stanford. A little while
ago, Frank, "(iuiby," (Alfred Dole]
and I sang some of our old songs,
and I was so homesick that I had
to cry quits."
The following letter from John
M. Switzer, received by a friend of
his in San Francisco, shows some
thing fu-ther of how time is passed
by the Stanford boys in Manila
and of how they like the eastern
territory which is soon to pass into
the possession of the United States:
"Ves, write not when the spirit
j moves, but when the mail moves.
We know about four hours before
j the mail goes, then everything is
! rush and push. There is any
amount of interesting matter to
write about, but how can you do it
for several friends in four hours.
First of all, I am well, as can be
expected. The fellows, however,
die every day. An hour ago a poor
fellow in the next company died of
small pox; his bunk is not thirty feet
: from mine. They took him to the
hospital when he caught it, and
j then he was brought back into
quarters. Fevers and dysentery
: pull hundreds of fellows down.
The strongest go first; Chet
Thomas is a walking skeleton.
I have been on the sick list fewer
days than any man in the com
pany. The whole army looks like
moving ghosts, and in spite of of
ficial reports to the contrary, we
all more than anxious to go home.
We are ready to fight. Spaniards or
any other enemy of our Hag and
civilization, but we have no even
show against the invidious inroads
!of fevers, smallpox, etc. The Red
I Cross, by its admirable work, has
won the gratitude of every soldier.
Of course you are not on
Paris Commission and are no more
interested in the disposition of
three islands than a U. S. Senator,
but in case the president would
ask your opinion, I venture
to give you the benefit of my ob
servation. If money alone is to be
considered in the matter, then hold
the islands, for millions are to be
made here, but if probable diplo
matic complications are considered,
give them to some one else. The
business prospects for one with cm pi -
! tal are a veritable Klondike here.
"We have met some beautiful
; "senoritas." They think the Ameri
cans are all right. I think when
we get back we shall get a sixty
days furlough, after whi h our dis
charge will be granted.' We have
great plans for those sixty days."
