# Dr. Andrews in Chicago.
## 
### 
Ex-president Andrews of Brown
University may resign the superin
tendency of the Chicago public
schools because of opposition to his
efforts to separate the schools from
politics. Dr. Andrews believes that
lie should have the power of a] -
pointing and promoting teacher?,
lie is supported by a majority < 112
the Board of Education, but the
game of politics is an interesting
one in Chicago, ami the politicians
are not in accord with Dr. Andrews'
method of administration. It !s
admitted that a member of the com
mittee erased some of his recom
mendations and submitted the re
vised letter to the board. Dr. An
drews says he wishes to pick out
the best material in order to im
prove the schools. His desire to
have good teachers is a blow to the
ancient system of pull, which the
politicians arc determined to main
tain.
