# ADDED TO THE FACULTY.
## Rabbi Voorsanger will Lecture next Semester, on "The Jewish Framework of Christianity." 
### 
Our department of Bionomics is
to receive a valuable addition next
semester in the person of Rabbi
Voorsanger of San Francisco, who
is already well known to Stanford
audiences as an occasional lecturer.
For some years he has held the
position of professor of Semitic
languages in the University of
California, and it is now partly
through the courtesy of that uni
versity that he conies to Stanford.
The subject of the course will be
one of which Rabbi Voorsanger
has the understanding of an earn
est scholar: The Jewish Frame
work of Christianity. 1 ' His treat
ment of the subject will occupy one
lecture a week fora semester. This
will probably not be given separate
as a course, but in connection with
the course at present given bv Dr.
Thoburn: "The Life and Teachings
of Christ." Thus expanded, the
course will be broadened and will
probably be changed from a two
hour to a three hour course. Dr.
Voorsanger is expected to have a
synopsis of his work ready within
a few weeks. In speaking of the
plan Dr. Thoburn said:
"We cannot study Christianity
properly unless we study the setting
to Christianity, and it will be this
early Christian environment that
the rabbi will attempt to give.
Christ came from and lived among
the Jews! and in the early cent uries
the entire setting and surroundings
of Christianity, the forms of wor
ship, the people of the time, the
friends of Christ, the very back
ground of the Christian era, were
all Jewish. And it will be this vast
field the learned rabbi will explore.
It promises to be one of the most
interesting courses in the University
not only to Bible students, but to
every lover of history. These lectures
will be entirely historical and will
have nothing to do with the Jewish
presentation of Christianity. Kabbi
Voorsanger is very learned upon
this subject, and the course, while
valuable, will be valuable only as
historv."
