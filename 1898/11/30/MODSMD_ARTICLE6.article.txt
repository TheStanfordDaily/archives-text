# A 						Gift to Michigan University.
## 
### 
Frederick Stearnes, a Detroit mil
lionaire, has presented to the Uni
versity of Michigan his unique col
lection of musical instruments,,
numbering nearly 1,000 pieces. Mr.
Stearnes has been collecting for fif
teen years and has spent upon his
treasure something over $25,000.
The present value of the collec
tion, however, is many times
that. The importance of the
collection for the University lies
in the fact that it exhibits, with
hardly a break, the evolution of the
three great types of instruments
from prehistoric times down to the
present. In this respect it can rival
the most famous collections* of this
country and of Europe.
The collection will be placed in a
room fitted up for it in the museum
building, and a complete catalogue,
lavishly illustrated, prepared by
Mr. Stearnes, will soon be published
by the University.
