Dr. F. L. Chase of the Yale Ob
servatory has discovered a new
comet from photographic plates ex
posed on the nights of November
14th and 15th. when the Leonid
meteors were due. Two plates were
exposed on each night and the
comet was photographed on each
plate. On the night of November
21st Dr. Chase exposed four more
plates, and an impression was found
on each plate. The clouds have
prevented more observations from
being taken on the nights of No
vember 22nd and 23rd. The ap
proach of the full moon will render
it very difficult to secure further
observations.
