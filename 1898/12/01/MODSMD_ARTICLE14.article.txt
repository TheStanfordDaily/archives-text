# Yale Wigwam Meeting.
## 
### 
At Yale there is a unique insti
tution, founded t<Â» promote debat
ing interests, known as the "Wig
wam Meeting." The conduct and
proceedings of this organization are
exceptionally novel and interest
ing.
The meetings aie bi-weekly. The
two camps (of twenty men each)
occupy different titles of the hall,
sitting in groups around small
tables. Light refreshment is pro
vided and the members are per
mitted to smoke. The permanent
ollieers are a first and second chair
man, who alternately preside and
alternately debate, a secretary
treasurer, and two captains of
camps. I'he last named have in
their hands the selection of ques
tions, the election of sides, and the j
appointment for each meeting of a
leader to conduct the debate for his
cam]). The presiding chairman,
immediately upon the disposing of
the night's business, selects one |
member from each camp, who. with
a guest specially invited to this
end, constitute a board of three
judges for the debate. I'he ques-j
tion is then announced and the
leader for the camp supporting the
affirmative outlines the position
which his camp intends to main
tain. the leader for the negative re
plying in kind. After this formal
opening, members of the two camps
volunteer alternately until the limit
of an hour is reached, when discus
sion ends and the two leaders close
the debate, summing up and refut
ing.
With the exception of the lead
ers, who conduct for only one
meeting, no members are required
t<> debate. The speaking is entirely
a matter of inclination, though a
a leader will usually confer with
several members of bis camp and
assign certain points that he would
like to have then bring out in the
debate. Otheiwise the speaking is
for the most part on the spur of
the moment, one of the chief aims
of the Wigwam being the selection
of subjects of such broad interest
i that no preparation is needed, that
extempore speaking may best be
developed. At the end of the de
bate the meetings become informal,
the nictiib ts singing together until
eleven, when the club adjourns.
The Wigwam in its tirst year of
trial succeeded so well that it was
unanimously decided to make it a
permanent and self-perpetuating
organization. Moreover, after the
membership of forty was selected
from the present sophomore class,
the demand for admission became
so great that a second body of
forty is to be organized on a simi
lar basis a fact which in itself
best attests its increasing popular
ity. This year three members of
the Junior Wigwam were selected
for the linal Princeton debate -a
practical illustration of the value
of extempore speaking and contin
ual practice which the Wigwam
with its restricted membership
aims to supply.
