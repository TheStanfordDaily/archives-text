The following is an interesting
editorial from the Harvard Advo
cate of October 31:
The problem of disposing of pro
ceeds seldom troubles a board of
college editors, because undergradu
ate publications are not usually
overburdened with their earnings.
Recent prosperity has, 1 o vever,
brought the Advocate a little money.
This might I e comfortably dividtd
among the editors, but they have
thought it better to spend the sur
plus in another way.
Accordingly it has been voted to
appropriate this year two hundred
dollars for meritorious undergradu
ates to be given, we hope, by the
Faculty committee on scholarships.
These gifts will be one hundred
dollars each, to be known as the
Harvard Advocate Scholarships,
and are to be awarded to men of
high rank, like scholarships regu
larly endowed. No conditions are
to be attached except that in case
of doubt on the part of the com
mittee, preference is to be shown
the student who has done well in
E ngl ishco m position.
The Philistine often asks a col
lege editor a question which is hard
to answer, "What is the paper for
—does it benefit anyone besides the
editors?" From the point of view
of one not interested in writing,
young literature does not seem
worth printing, and before a hard
headed, practical man the amateur
publisher cannot make a strong
defense. The college editor has
ceased to wonder or care much
whether his efforts appeal to bread
and-butter students. He would,
however, prefer that they should
take an interest in his work, and
see that he has practical interests,
that his eyes are not concentrated
on a sheet of paper. The one ad
vantage which the Advocate can de
rive from this new movement is to
gain the respect of the large num
ber of men who do not care for col
lege literature, but who, knowing
the value of a hundred dollars,
may be led to look on undergradu
ate publications with a more favor
able eye.
This acknowledgment of the bene
fits that may react on the Advocate,
in part forestalls the charge which
certain men cannot refrain from
making, that no one does an act of
disinterested kindness, that to give
money is simply to buy favor. The
Advocate makes no counter-claim.
The money is there and there seems
nothing better to do with it.
