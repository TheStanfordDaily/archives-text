a sunrise upon which are emblaz
oned the motto, "Equal Rights to
All." The price is "ten cents
Mexican." In this issue it an
nounces that hereafter it will re

patches. The news naturally,
principally concerns the war.
Under the leading locals are the
following interesting notes:
"Pursuant to telegraphic in
struction from the Adjutant Gen

vate George L. Ilees, Company K y
Ist California Volunteer Infantry,
will be discharged from the service

"The following notice is posted
in the postollice: 'We do not know
when the next steamer leaves for

"A boxing match lias been ar
ranged between Jake Croueher and
C. F. Saunders, to take place on the
evening of October .'5l. ;it the Phil
ippine theatre, for $25 a side and a.
purse of $25."
There are clippings from Spanish
papers which show the hostile atti
tude to the Americans. There is
a discussion of the question "Ought
we to keep the Phillipines?" which
is decided in the negative.
It is interesting to notice that
nearly half the advertisements are
for various liquors, one entire page
of the four being devoted to one
firm.
