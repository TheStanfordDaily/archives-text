Tomorrow the student hotly meets
to choose its representatives on the
preliminaries of the intercollegiate
debate. Because the date of the
final debate is distant and because
other matters of interest will come
up at the same meeting, there is
danger that this may he hastily
done. The constitution provides
that the student body may have at
least as many representatives as
each society. These have hereto
fore been chosen by vote of the
whole body, and in previous years
a tendency has been shown by that
body to keep the number small by
electing only such men as are well
known personally. This year's in
stitution of semi-linals provides for
the easy handling of a large num
ber of applicants. it is to be
hoped that many will come forward
for nomination, and that none will
be voted down. It is not always
the best known men who make the
teams and do their university the
most credit.
