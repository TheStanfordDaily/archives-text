Miss Anmk S. I'k< k, acting upon
the invitation of Dr. Jordan, will
repeat her lecture on "Mountain
eering in Tvrol and Switzerland"
in the chapel Monday evening. The
slides illustrative of the lecture are
superior to any collection of views
â€¢exhibited here. They show both
the peaceful and the heroic in Swiss
scenery. All those who can should
avail themselves of this opportunity
to hear Miss Peck and become more
familiar with the characteristics of
Swiss seenerv.
