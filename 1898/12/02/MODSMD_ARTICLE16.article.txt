Thk election this afternoon of so
many students to represent the stu
dent body in the semi-final prelim
inaries for the Intercollegiate de
hate is certainly an encouraging
sign of the awakening that is com
ing to Stanford in debating mat
ters. Such an interest is exactly
what is necessary t<> bring out our
best speakers and without it we
â€¢could never hope to deteat ''a 1 -
ifornia when we meet her to com
pete for forsensic honors next April.
After the different debating soci
eties have added their representa
tives and the general list is opened
to those not otherwise provided for,
should there be any, the roll will
contain enough names to make the
preliminaries far more interesting
and the competition far more keen
than ever before. The team that
will be thus selected will be the best
we can produce and the members of
it will earn the more honor for hav
ing won out against so many com
petitors.
