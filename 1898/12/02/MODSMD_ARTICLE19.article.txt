# Stanford Taxation.
## 
### 
'l lit- friends of Stanford Univer
sity will ask th-e Legislature tliis
winter to submit a constitutional
amendment exempting that insti
tution from taxation. Utah is the
only other State in the Union
where an amendment to the con
stitution would be required to ex
empt an educational institution
like Stanford from taxation, but as
that course is necessary we can see
no reason why the Legislature
should not do as requested and
permit the people of the State to
pass directly upon the question.
Stanford University has already
accomplished great good to the
people of this State. Thousands
of young men and women have re
ceived an education here equal to
that conferred by the State Uni
versity. Since its establishment
the generous rivalry excited be
tween it and the Berkeley school
has greatly benefitted the iatter,
and the result has been aptly stated
as follows: ''Before Stanford the
State had no famous university.
Now it has two."
The people of this State have
shown commendable generosity in
the support of the State Udiversity.
All expenses of that institution aie
paid by direct taxation. The net
income of Stanford University
from the various bequests made by
the late Senator Stanford and Mrs.
Jane Stanford, at the present time,
is about $180,000 per annum. Of
this amount the State and counties
take about one-fourth in taxes.
This puts the Stanford University
in the position of doing everything
for the people of the State that the
university accomplishes without
cost to the taxpayers, and al the
same time-being compelled to con
tribute of its funds nearly $45,000
every year toward paying the ex
penses of the State.
Tliis 011 its face is unfair. We
do not know what complications
may arise when an amendment is
proposed that will only affect the
Stanford University, but the people
ill certainly see the advantage of
releasing from taxation an institu
tion that is doing so much for the
State. The boys and girls educated
at Stanford would cost the taxpay
ers a great deal more than the
taxes received from the Stanford
University amounts if educated at
Berkeley, and we trust the coming
Legislature will submit an amend
ment exempting Stanford from
taxat ion. Dt mocrat
