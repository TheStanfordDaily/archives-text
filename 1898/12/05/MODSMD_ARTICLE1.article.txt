# TRAINING HOUSE PROJECT.
## Plan for the '99 Class to Begin a Movement for Erection of Club House for Our Teams. 
### 
A movement which has been in
the air for some time in Senior Class
circles is beginning to take definite
shape, and what at first was en
thusiastically discussed as a desir
able project —the erection of some
permanent, useful memorial of the
class' presence in the University
is becoming crystallized in a more
tangible form in the idea of the
formation of a fund for the erection
of an athletic training house for all
the University teams.
At a meeting of the recently ap
pointed Finance Committee of the
'99 Class, consisting of J. E. Mc-
Dowell, R. A. Leiter, and Forrest
S. Fisher (chairman), plans were
discussed fora memorial to be pre
sented by the class to the Univer
sity upon graduation. The senti
ment of the class is undoubtedly
favorable to some such action, and
ways and means, together with the
character of the proposed memorial
were diecussed very thoroughly. It
was the concensus of opinion in the
committee that the most pressing
need of our athletic teams and the
most essential requirement for the
development of a systematic athletic
policy was a centrally located train
ing house, along the lines proposed
in the investigations made last year
when the subject was discussed.
The committee considered that the
general trend of affairs would make
this year especially opportune for
the institution of a movement look
ing toward the erection of a club
house, and it was decided to seize
the dilemmaby the horns and recom
mend a line of action to the class
having that as the object. Various
means were discussed for raising
money which will be suggested to
the class.
Chairman Forrest S. Fisher to
day outlined the recommendation
that the committee will* make to
the class as follows:
"The plan of the Finance Com
mittee is in brief this—To have the
'99 Class institute a movement for
the erection of an athletic training
house for the use of the University
teams, and —as it is a University
affair and one which every one de
sires to see successful —to secure the
co-operation of the students, alumni,
faculty, and friends of the Univer
sity in a vigorous effort to raise the
necessary funds. Besides, if the
class approves of the matter, we
have a few little schemes of our own
for raising money which we can not
yet make public.
''The most important thing is for i
some one to take the lead in the
matter, and this we desire the Class ;
of '99 to do, not entirely from mo
tives of class pride, but from the
standpoint of University patriotism,
because we believe the athletes j
should have better training faeili-|
ties, and also because we think the |
precedent should be established for
the Senior Class upon graduation j
to show their appreciation of the
University by some such act.
"If anything is to be done it
must be begun immediately, as one
semester is a short time in which to
work up such an undertaking. Wej

may not raise the whole amount
necessary this year, but we can at
least establish a training house
fund."
President Milnor Roberts has
called a meeting of the '99 Class at
1:15 Wednesday for the discussion
and action upon the committee's re
port, which will bt submitted at
that time.
