It is to lie hoped that the plan of
the Finance Committee, published
.in another column, of starting a
fund to be employed in the con
struction of an athletic training
house, meets with the support that
it deserves. The scheme is a good
one and can he worked out success
fully if it receives the active sup
port of the members of the class.
The need of such quarters as out
lined iii the plan, has been keenly
felt here for some seasons. It will
l)e by successfully carrying out such
undertakings as the '99 Finance
Committee has proposed that a class
of the University will be remem
ibered and stand out particularly
in the years that are to come. The
training house scheme offers the op
portunity for the Senior Class to do
.something that will give it an en
viable place among Stanford classes.
Thi' training house scheme is bound
to materialize. Some day it will
assume much greater proportions.
The honor of definitely starting the
pr< >ject should belong to the seniors
of this vear.
