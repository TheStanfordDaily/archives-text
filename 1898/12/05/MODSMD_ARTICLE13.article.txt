Rov. Charles- If. Locke, I >. I).,
pastor of the Central Methodist
Cliureh of San Francisco, delivered
the sermon in the chapel yesterdav
morning. He took for his text the
exclamation of Paul at the climax
of his address before King Agrippa.
"Whereupon, O King Agrippa. 1
was not disobedient to the heavenlv
vision."
The minister.first recited the cir
cumstanees of the death of Stephen,
when the young man, Saul of
Tarsus, stood by and consented to
the stoning of the first Christian
! martyr. He next drew an eloquent
and graphic picture of the scene
thirty years later when Paul, a
prisoner at the court of Festus. was
summoned to speak before the vis
iting prince, Agrippa. No longer a
follower of the Judean philosopher,
but now a powerful advocate of
Christianity, the old man Paul,
with yet the same intellectual fea
tures of the young Saul of thirty
years before, delivered one of the
most matchless pieces of rhetoric
ever created. Instead of pleading
for his freedom, he tells til his con
version and of the appearance of
Christ to him in a vision, and
reaches the climax of his wonderful
speech in the words of the text,
"\\ hereupon, 0 King Agrippa, 1
was not disobedient to the heavenly
vision."
I)r. Locke then proceeded to de
velop the lesson that God has direct
personal supervision over every
thing he has made. Never before
has God been so recognized as con
nected with all that is physical.
Antagonisms of the past century
are disappearing; science is becom
ing more religious, and religion
more scientific. Evolution is the
istic, not materialistic. It is now
recognized that in the beginning
was (iod, then evolution. Theology,
the study of the character and spirit
of (iod, and science, the study of
the material world as found today,
work side by side. The Infinite
mind is conceded to be behind all
things. As is shown by the zoologist
in the study of insect life, The
Creator puts himself in every cre
ated thing, (iod is present in all
things.
If God has a design in the entire
universe, he must be definitely in
terested in man. Man is the cul
mination of the infinite purpose,
his salvation, the culmination of
creation. All things appear to be
made for his development. By a
miracle God gave the initial im
pulse to the atoms of matter, and a
world of glorious power developed,
then was produced animal life.
Final I v, (iod came down t«> perfect
the i inimal. man, ami deposited in
his body the soul with self
propagating power, an act as
natural and as reasonable as to
give the initial impulse. After a
lapse of thousands of years, not vet
satisfied with man's development.
( mkl chose the most perfect man
•Jesus Christ, in whom to deposit
his own divine nature. God is mak
ing man his partner. He made
him just as divine us He dared; for
had man been created as divine as
the Almighty, he would have taken
the worl I into his own hands and
disappointed (iod. Men of the fu
ture. sons of God. in the full lies of
divine nature, will appeal for the
( oronation of divinity: as compared
with them, the men of todav will
be mere pigmies.
" I >o we follow (iod by theories,
or does he speak to the human soul?
hverv man today has his hcavenlv
vision. Whatever impulse turns
us to move aside from the plans we
ha ve ma ppeil out to some bet■tor pur

pose, that is a heavenly vision.
Lvery conscientious person, living
an upright life, has a vision. Any
demonstrated truth becomes sacred
and belongs to our visions, hut lack
the courage to obey. Our peace
depends upon our obedience to the
infinite. Obedience to (iod means
that we must get close to him
through Christ by the manner of
our association with fellowmen.
Ihe modern creed knows only two
commands. ''Love (iod with all
your soul and mind and strength,"
and '"Love one another." If we
find (iod, we find him in our asso
ciations. among our fellows. "In
asmuch as ye have done it untoone
of the least of these, ve have done
it unto me."
