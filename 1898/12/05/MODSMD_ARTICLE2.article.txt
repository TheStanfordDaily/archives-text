# For Tax Exemption.

### 
The following editorial taken
from the Santa Ana Blade of Nov
ember 30, is interesting as showing
what some others are thinkint;
about the matter:
"There is justice in the claim
made by the Stanford University
people that that institution should
be relieved from taxation. A con
stitutional amendment to effect this
end will be introduced in the legis
lature. The following from the
Palo Alto Times is true and is a
strong argument in favor of grant
ing the w r ishes of Stanford: 'Stan
ford is as much a state institution
as the university at Berkeley. It
charges no tuition and its doors
are open to all alike. During the
seven years of its existence it has
given an education to three thou
sand young men and women. In
every way Stanford has been as
great an aid to education as has the
University of California. Every
state in the Union except California
and Utah recognizes in its constitu
tion and laws the principle of tax
exemption for its great institutions
of learning. California ought not
to do less. Take off the tax.' "
