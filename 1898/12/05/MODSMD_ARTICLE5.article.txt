# CARNOT TEAM CHOSEN.
## Final Preliminaries for the Coming Contest Held in the Chapel Last Saturday Evening. 
### 
The final preliminaries for the
Carnot debate were hell in the
chapel on last Saturday evening
and three men and one alternate
were selected by the judges to
represent our University against
Berkeley in the annual contest for
the Carnot medal which will take
place in our chapel early in
February. Those selected are .J.
E. Springer, '00, Anthony 11. Suz
zallo, '99, and Carl T. Hay den, '00,
with James Ferguson, '99, as
alternate.
The debate was one of the most
interesting preliminary contests
we have had and it left everyone
who attended thoroughly pleased
with the debating outlook at Stan
ford for the present year. The ques
tion, "Resolved, That it would be
more to the interests of France to
form an alliance with England than
Russia," was a live one, and the
manner in which it was handled
by the seven speakers demonstrated
that they had covered it quite
thoroughly. In every instance the
arguments showed careful prepara
tion and Â» determination that, win
or lose, each one should do his or
her best.
The debate lasted about two
hours, each speaker being allowed
fifteen minutes, to be divided ac
cording to his or her pleasure. Pro
fessor C. A. Duniway presided. Be
fore tl e discussion he announced
the general rules in accordance with
which the preliminaries are con
ducted, and at the close of the con
test, in his capacity as a member of
the Stanford faculty committee
which, in conjunction with a similar
c mimittee from Berkeley, selects
the question for the Carnot debate,
he announced the field within
which the final subject will be
found. This field is "The commer
cial and diplomatic relations of
France and Italy."
At the close of the debate the
judges, Professors Frank A. Fetter,
I). E. Spencer, and A.(i. New
comer, retired for completing their
duties and after a deliberation last
ing about fifteen minutes, they
handed the names of the successful
speakers to the chairman who an
nounced them in alphabetical order.
After the applause following the
announcement of the decision three
rousing cheers were given for the I
Carnot team and for the judges.
