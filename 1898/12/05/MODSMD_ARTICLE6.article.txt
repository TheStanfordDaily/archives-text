## 
### 
The musical olul>» gave the first
concert of tbe year Friday evening
in San Jose and scored a distinct
social, artistic, and financial suc
cess. A good sized audience com
posed of representative San Joseans
and parties of students who drove
down from the campus greeted the
clubs in (iermania Hall and en
cored the numbers of the new and
varied program from beginning to
end. The tilee Club, while its
numbers were not as popular as
some of the old favorites, showed
excellent training and, for the first
appearance, sang with much polish
and effect. The club is stronger, in
many respects, than ever before;
the improvement in the tenors

makes it tlie most evenly balanced
organization in years.
The Mandolin Club was in good
form and is fully ii|» to the stand
ard of last year. The playing of
the "Cleon Waltzes" and of the
"Stars and Stripes" showed its ver
sa tali tv.
The Banjo Club was a great sur
prise to those who did not know ol
its reorganization. The club de
serves great credit for its perform
ance which was as well received 21*
any part of the program.
The evening was enlivened by a
good list of specialities. Frank
lliley, '00, whose work is always
a popular feature of the concerts,
gave two new monologues and sang
the bright "Zizzy Ze Zum Zum"
with the club. Lewis Emery '00
made a decided hit with the coon
song "Dark Town Is Out Tonight. w
Clare Strohn, '00, by his clever
dance, as usual made himself a
favorite. The novelty of the pro
gram was the "Chalk Talk, by
"Dick'' Culver, whose dry wit and
humorous sketches combined u»
make a delightful number.
The clubs after a dance returned
to the campus the same evening by
buses.
