Evkky student should exercise
his right to vote at the election to
morrow. We are to choose a man
who will look after the business
side of our football interests for the
coming year, and each one of us
owes it to his University, as a mem
ber of the student body, to take part
Tn this election, which is so vital to
the welfare of our athletics. A gen
oral. lively interest in our student
affairs will prevent political com
binations, with the r< suit that the
most competent nen will be se
lected to till student body offices.
