Id commenting on the struggle
which the friends of the University
have begun for tax exemption, tin*
Areata Union printed the following
editorial:
''Stanford certainly labors under a
great disadvantage as compared to
the State University, which is quite
heavilv endowed, and receives state
aid besides. The tax which Stan
ford pays goes to the University as
state aid, or in other words, Stan
ford is taxed to help build up the
State University No one questions
the propriety of state aid for the
U. C., but that same justice should
I>e put to the test by exempting
Stanford.
''Humboldt county liasa number
of students in both of these great
institutions, and is therefore more
or less interested in their welfare.
This exemption movement should
be carefully looked into by our
representatives at Sacramento, as it
is one of vital interest to our county
and State."
