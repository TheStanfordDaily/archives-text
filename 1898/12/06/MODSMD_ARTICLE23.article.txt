## 
### 
Bv the gift of $50,000 from Mr.
James Stillman of New York City
to cover the cost of land and an in
firmary for sick students, the im
mediate building of the Harvard
Infirmary, which has been under
discussion for several years, is at
last assured
The infirmary will hear the name
of the donor, who lias made his
munificent gift unhampered by re
strictions. In addition, Mr. Still
man will contribute annually for
four years the sum of $2,f>00 toward
the support of the infirmary.
The land for the building has al
ready been purchased and is most
favorably situated for the uses of a
college infirmary. The lot, with
100 feet front on Mt. Auburn
street and a dep'h of about 280
feet, abuts in the rear on the new
Metropolitan Parkway and over
looks the Charles River and Sol
diers Field beyond. It is between
the Cambridge Hospital and the
new Home for Aged People.
Plans for the building are already
under consideration and it is pro
posed to break ground in the spring
as soon as the weather permits.-
