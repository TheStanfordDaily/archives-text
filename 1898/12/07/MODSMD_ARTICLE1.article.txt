# LAST NIGHTS LECTURE.
## Dr. Jordan Repeats the Talk on Imperial Democracy Given at Omaha. 
### 
The lecture last night was the
address Dr. Jordan gave at Omaha,
before the Congress of Religions, in
opposition to imperialism, the text
being taken from Kipling's "Reces
sional," the noblest hymn of our
century, "Lest We Forget."
"For it seemed to me," said Dr.
Jordan, "that we might forget who
we were and for what we ttood. In
the sudden intoxication of far-off
victory, with the consciousness of
power and courage, with all the
world talking of us, our great, stern
mother patting us on the hack, and
all lesser peoples looking on in fear
or envy we might well lose our
heads. But greater glory than
this has been our lot before. For
more than a century our nation
has stood for something higher and
nobler than success in war, some
thing not enhanced by a victory at
sea, or a wild, bold charge over a
hill lined with masked batteries.
"We have stood for civic ideals,
and the greatest of these is that gov
ernment should make men by giv
ing them freedom to make them
selves. The glory of the American
republic is that it is the embodi
ment of American manhood. It
was the dream of the fathers that
American government and repub
lican manhood should be co-exten
sive; that the nation should not go
where freedom cannot go.
"This is the meaning of Washing
ton's farewell address: that Amer
ica should grow strong within her
self, should keep out of all fights
and friendships that are not her
Own, should secure no territory in
which a free man cannot live, and
should own no possessions that may
not in time be numbered among
the United States. In other words,
America should not be a power
among the nations, hut a nation
among the powers. This view of
the function of our country is
based on sound political common
sense, and in the rush of new claims
and new possibilities this old wis
dom we should not forget.
"I hear men speak today of the
glorious results of war when they
mean results of peace recalled to us
so suddenly. A war of a few weeks
cannot make or mar a nation. Its
glare but shows old facts in new
light.
"The splendid courage of our vol
unteers, the magnificent, effective
ness of our trained naval officers,
the solidarity of our country, our
national and international con
sciousness, our oneness with Eng
land, have been waxing and
strengthening longer than any of
us have lived. They are the
splendid heritage of years of peace,
but let us look at these matters in
a little detail.
"The power of training we recog
nize everywhere except in our pub
lic service. The value of skill is the
lesson of our navy.
"We say that war has at last
united the North and the South.
So at least it appears; but our
nation was sound already else a few
weeks could not have welded it to
iler. The solid South, the bugaboo
■! ti »cii!!. '! i< ■ c!<v»!' /if port hct'i)

venality, has passed away forever.
"Patriotism is the will to serve
one's country; to make one's country
better worth serving. It is a course
of action rather than a sentiment.
Whatever is noisy, whether in Con
gressor the pulpit, or in the streets,
can not he patriotism. There is a
higher patriotism than love of
nation. It is love of justice. Nobler
than the solidity of Americanism is
tl.e bond of sympathy which unites
in one the whole Anglo-Saxon race.
"Surface differences there have
been and mav be again. British
cabinets have been overbearing
and Brit s i celebrities have been
patronizing. American diplomacy
in its shirt sleeves has faced British
diplomacy in helmet of brass. But
our blood is English, our manhood
is English, our speech is English,
our literature is English, we breathe
the breath of England and think
with English thought. Whatever
our fortunes in the world, we can
never be wholly estranged from the
island which was our home, the
home of free men, whose language
still must frame the words in which
men speak of liberty.
"This year of 1898 makes one of
the three world crises in ou~ his
tory. The first crisis followed the
warof the revolution. Its question
was this, What relation shall the
weak scattered colonies of varying
tempers and various ambitions bear
one another? The answer was the
American Constitution, the federa
tion of self - governing United
States.
"The second crisis came through
the growth of slavery. The union
of the states, we found, could not
'permanently endure half slave
half free.'
"Today it is not the conquest of
Spain, not the disposition of the
spoils of victory which first con
cerns us. It is the spirit that lies
behind it. Shall our armies go
where our institutions cannot?
Shall territorial expansion take the
place of democratic freedom, our
invasion of tin; Orient he merely an
incident, an accident, of a warof
knight-errantry, temporary and ex
ceptional? Or is it to mark a new
policy? the revision of our demo
cracy to imperialism? It is my be
lief that the crisis is already pass
ing. A century of republicanism
has given the common man com
mon sense, and the tawdy glories
of foreign dominion already cease
to dazzle and deceive. Hut the re
sponsibilities of our acts are upon
us. Hawaii and Alaska are ours al
ready. Cuba and Porto Kico we
cannot escape, and most unfortu
nate of all the most of us see no
clear way to justice toward the
Philippines. The insistant duties
of 'compulsory imperialism' al
ready clamor for our attention. To
the end that we may go ahead first
into the serious work of 'Compulsorv
Imperialism,' I invite your atten
tion to a, number of easy propos
itions or axioms of political science,
pertinent, each in its degree, to the
topic before us.
"Colonial expansion is not nation
al growth. There ie no objection
to national expansion where honor
ably brought about. If there were
any more space to be occupied bv
