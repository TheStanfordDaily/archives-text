# STUDENT BODY ELECTION

the arrangements. The ballots were
distributed only as the voters were
ready to use them and no election

defined limits.
At 2:30 this afternoon the polls
were closed, the ballot-box was
taken to room 23 quad, and there

tives of each candidate the Execu
tive Committee counted the ballots
in the box and the names checked
on the official list. The number in
both cases was 516. The counting
of the votes cast for each candidate
was then proceeded with, no one
being allowed in the room except
the designated representatives of the
candidates and the members of the
Executive Committee. Within less
than an hour the count was com
pleted, verified, and announced on
the official bulletin-board. The
number of votes cast for football
manager was 516. Of these Fred
L. Berry received 343, and Alfred
