To rim Editor:
The refusal of the faculty Oom
niittee on Student Affairs to allow
the Varsity musical clubs to make
the customary holiday tour, and
the candid admission that the suc
cessful southern tour of last year
was allowed only because the stu
dent body had made contracts too
binding to set aside, marks a policy
which strikes at the very heart of
this form of college activity.
The faculty and student body
and Stanford sympathizers every
where arc proud of the clubs, of their
successes and of the undeniable
good they do the college. Though
we may not need "advertising'
they have helped to make the. name

of Stanford popular in the best, the
representative homes wherever they
hnve gone. The men have collec
tively or individually as much love
of alma mater, and display as much
college spirit as any who have the
honor of representing the Univer
sity in any way.
The reasons hinted at by the
committee in stopping the tour this,
year have hardly enough justifica
tion in fact to warrant a movement
such as this. Furthermore this ac
tion against the clubs, when gener
ally known, will do more to cast an
undeserved slur on student organ
ization than is imagined.
What the Thanksgiving game is
to the team, the tour is to the clubs.
Take away the big game and what
is left of Stanford football? Take
away this annual opportunity for
the musical men to sing the college
songs and give the yell in far away
places and you take away the great
incentive to keep together.
This decision of the committee i3
made at an unfortunate time, in
what has been called a "slump"
year at Stanford when the work of
the clubs would be more valuable
than ever. It is also made in the
face of last year's tour which as an
artistic and financial success, stands
unprecedented in the history of the
college. F. B. R.
