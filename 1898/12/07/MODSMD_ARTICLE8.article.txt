Now that the training house prop- j
osition- is beginning to assume
definite shape, through the leader
ship of the Senior Class, it would 1
be well to hear the report of the;
committee appointed some time
ago to investigate the plan for set
tling upon the location of the ath
letic fields. The plans for the build
ing would naturally depend to a
great extent upon its location on
or off the campus, and thus this
committee's report must naturally
be adopted first. Without doubt
the training house should be pushed
through. We are lamentably weak
here as regards training facilities, j
as, for instance, there is not a single
warm shower on the campus which
the men may use, and this is only
indicative of the lack in other re
spects. The proposition was broach

e 1 last year but the time was not
i ripe for it and, though assured of
c msiderahle support, it fell through.
This year such a thing must not
happen. We realize that there is
something to he done and we must
| do it.
