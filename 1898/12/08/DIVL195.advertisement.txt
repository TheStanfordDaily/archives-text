TO NEED GLASSES
is one thing; to be properly fitted is quite
another. We find a difference in the eyes in
ahout ON K HAI.F the cases which come to us
for glasses. This shows the necessity ol having
| each eye fitted independent of the oilier. IT
; you are a wearer ol glasses, undoubtedly they
I need adjusting—we do this without charge.
CHARGES MODERATE ALWAYS.
