Wk publish today the member
ship rolls of thevaiious litcmry de
bating; Huietes at tin- I niversity.
Out of a registration of near twelve
hundred students, only about one
hundred and fifty have taken ad
vantage of this opportunity to de
velop readiness of speech, one of

tlie most important branches of a
practical education. Strange t<>
say, this number scarcely equals
the Law majors, to say nothing of
History, English, :in<l the other de
partments. Instead of six or seven
of these organizations then; should
beat least twelve, with :• 11 average
membership of twenty-live.
All the present societies are doing
good work this year. Debating is
on the up grade at Stanford, as was
shown by the interest manifested
and the strong men brought out at
the Carnot preliminaries. There is
a quiet determination on the part
of every member to do his best to
develop strong intercollegiate teams.
Should we be able to win both de
bates this year—and the outlook is
encouraging—we should have one
Intercollegiate to our credit, and
should lack but one Carnot of Iwing
equal with our rivals.
