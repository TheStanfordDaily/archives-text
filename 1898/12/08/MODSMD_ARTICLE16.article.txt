## 
### 
I Now that the football reason is
lover, critics and friends of the game
i are offering suggestions as to
| changes in the rules of the game.
;So far however the general opinion
seems to be that almost no changes
will he necessary, that the game is
approaching perfection. ()ne change
however, will he brought to the at
tention of the foot ball experts in
regard to the goal from touchdown,
and the suggestion will probably
come from the West. The goal
kick following tlu* touchdown has
| been the source of untold lament
this year, especially in the West.
It has upset calculations and sonic
times relegated superior teams to
the second class. Jiy many it has
! come to be regarded in the nature
of a fluke; and some of the promi
nent football experts in the country
will he for its entire abolition when
the question comes up for scttle
i ment.;
The committee on I'ldl'S last win
ter, both in the East and West, be
littled the goal touchdown and cut
its productiveness in two. It is
hoped by a large number of foot-1
ball enthusiasts that it will been-'
tirely abolished this year. It is l
claimed that -Professor Stagg of the- j
University of Chicago is in favor of :
its al>olishment. Coach Huff of
the University of Illinois looks
with disfavor on it, and the same is
true with Coach Hannard of North-:
western and Coach King of Wis
consin." Captain Pixlcy of the:
C. A. A. team says it might just as]
.Well uyt be.included in the book of j
rules.
It is argued that the goal from J
'touchdown gives «o evidence of the,
ability of a team to score and roll j
up points, and that [.the weakest
man on the eleven might be the
best goal kicker. The man who
tries for goal after a touchdown has
been made is given all the time he
needs, with no opposition,- and the
point thus gained -shows nothing of
the ability of the tea.ni. The ad
mittedly weaker team might score
a touchdown on a. fluke and then
kick goal, perhaps tVing the score.—
