# "Hamlet" in The Classroom.
## 
### 
The class in Enlish 27 yesterday
completed a rather novel and in
teresting experiment. In the play
of Hamlet which was tin* subject of
study, the characters were assigned
to students, each student taking
one character through an act. The
play was read in five days, one reci
tation period being devoted to each
act. No attempt was made to give
a dramatic presentation of the play
but the lines were rendered with as
much intelligence and appreciation
as possible, and as many gestures
and suggestions of action were made
use of as was necessary to avoid the
flatness of a mere reading. Several
members illuminated, their lines
not inconsiderably by their rend
erings. This was particularly true
of Professor Anderson, who read
the part of Hamlet throughout the
play. The seriousness of the class
in the undertaking made it much
more successful than might have
been expected before it had been
undertaken.
