# Student Guild Finances.
## 
### 
Many of our students have not
appreciated the work done l>y the
Students' Guild. It is not in its
nature self-advertising, as the in
dividual eases of assistance ren
dered by it to sick members are
never made public.
The Guild, during the siv-?ral
years of its existence prior to this,
expended nearly $450 upon such
cases. This semester it has widened
its field; it has been assisting sev
eral protracted illnesses; it has paid
a monthly retaining fee to a skilled
nurse whose services at greatly re
duced rates have been available to
its members; it has expended $">(â€¢
in emergency medicines, through
the University physician, to which
its members are freely entitled.
While its objects are mainly char
itable, its expenses this semester
have exceeded its revenues. A sul
scription fee of fifty cents is asked
from students on the registration
days of each semester. Unless the
Guild receives stronger support from
the students during the coming se
mester than it has during the first,
it will be compelled to go back
ward instead of forward, and glvi
up some of the assurances for san
itary treatment of unfortunate stu
dents which it has lately sought to
provide. No one connected with
the Guild receives any fees or in
come whatever. Any surplus which
may accumulate is put into a sink
ing-fund, with which it is ulti
mately intended to build a hospital
on the campus.
