A letter received in Palo Alto
from Professor and Mrs. Griggs re
cently tells of their enjoyable stay
in Paris, during which the former
made considerable headway on his
book "Social Progress and Personal
Ideals," and the latter enjoyed the
privilege of taking vocal lessons
from the celebrated Italian vocal
ist, Mme. Bertrami.
Since leaving Paris they have
been in Switzerland, and are now in
Italy fora month's Â«tav, after which
they will go to Munich. Professc r
Barnes has been with them since
he left London some weeks ago. In
London he delivered a course of
lectures which proved very popular,
being largely attended throughout.
