# A 						RELIC OF BARBARISM.
## A 						Strong Editorial from the "Land of Sunshine" on Tax-Exemption. 
### 
In this months Land of Sun
shine is an outspoken editorial
headed "A Relic of Barbarism,"
on the question of tax exemption
which we reprint in full.
"It is a disgrace to California
that it tuxes Stanford University,
its most famous institution of learn
ing. The $00,000 a year the State
wrings from this young but splen
did college is a twenty-five per cent,
income tax —it is one-fourth of the
college income. The tax is a pen
alty on intelligence and good citi
zenship. No other State in the
Union, except Utah, is so benighted
as to make education a finable of
fense.
"As a cold-blooded business propo
sition, it would pay California to
invert the case and tax itself
$('>o,ooo a year for this University,
but this is not asked. Ever since
its inception, Stanford University
has done a vast money's worth of
good to the State every year, and
in the most unexpected channels.
It has done more than anything
else to vitalize the State institution
at Berkeley. No hundred thousand
dollars the State ever spent on the
University of California brought as
important results as the enlight
ened and generous rivalry of Stan
ford has given Berkeley every year.
It has been a resurrection from the
respectable trance into which learn
ing here had fallen. It has changed
the whole face of education in Cali
fornia, affecting even the public
schools. It has made California
known for the first time as a force
in the world of scholarship —and
an unwilling, skeptical world it
was.
"Stanford is a free University. It
charges no tuition; but it will be
obliged to if the State continues to
drain a quarter of its resources. We
believe such a barbarism will not
continue. When every Californian
who cares for education shall have
grasped the situation, we shall get
a legislative enactment exempt
ing Stanford from taxation and the
State from reproach."
