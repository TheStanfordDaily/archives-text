ecutive session" and announced
the purpose of the meeting, which
he said was "toelect 'Chet' Murphy j
captain." Captain Fisher placed
Murphy in nomination and amo-i
tion to declare him elected was
passed in a second. Speeches by
the newly elected captain in which
lie pledged himself to do his best
for Stanford, by the now ex-Cap
tain Fisher, cheers for the new and
the retiring captain, the Stanford
veil, and the pleasant formality of
installing a new captain was over
especial ly pleasing, as many of the
past elections have been, because
there was no opposition.

tain for 18i)9. is one of the most

speedy work in interference, and
even work in tackling have been
his strong points. As quarterback
