that college ;_!<•< dub- should made
tours during vacations.
2. The faculty committee on
Studenl Affairs has refused to allow
the triu-ical clubs to taken an ex
tended tour during tic coming va
cation. :»11<! has announced this as
its policy tor the future. The rea

upon ih> se tours the said commit-,

to college.
7. We have mude every reason
able attempt to come t<» an agree
ment with the committee, according
to their suggestions, but in every
case we have met with their disap
proval.
Therefore, we, the Stanford Glee
and Mandolin clubs, do resolve:
1. That we heartily endorse the
sentiments expressed by one of our
number in an article in the Daily
Palo Alto of December 7.
2. That we deeply regret that the
present committee on student af
fairs does not deem us worthy «if
representing our University on ex
tended tours.
