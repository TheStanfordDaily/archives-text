After an unpleasant but un
avoidable delay, the first number
of Volume XIV. of the Daily Palo
Alto makes its appearance today,
printed again by the University
Press. We feel that we must apol
ogize for this delay, and yet, under
the circumstances, it was inevitable.
The story of the loss to the paper
of its business manager and the ef
forts to refill his place are told in
another column. The present man
agement has felt strongly that
the Daily Palo Alto should be
printed on the campus, not
only for the good of the pub
lication, but also because the
maintenance of a University Press
at Stanford is a matter of no slight
consideration. The change has
been made, not without difficulties,
some of which are not entirely over
come. The expenses of publica
tion will be greater than they were
before the change and we shall
need the hearty co-operation of
every friend to make the J)aily
Palo Alto as worthy of the Uni
versity as it has been in former
years. There were some subscribers
who were so much opposed to the
removal to Palo Alto that they dis
continued their subscriptions; we
expect as strong an interest in the
college newspaper as their former
actions would seem to indicate.
As for our policy, we do not
contemplate any innovations.
Our aim shall be to attain as
nearly as possible the standard
set by former editors, and we realize
fully that this is a sufliciently high
aim The Daily Palo Alto will
continue to be, as before, first, a
newspaper; second, a college news
paper; and, above all, a Stanford
newspaper.
