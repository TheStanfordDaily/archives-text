In another column may be found
the call for a meeting of those who
intend to work upon the Daily
Palo Alto this semester. It is
called for the purpose of organizing
the staff, upon whose efficiency the
quality of the paper so much de
dends. Work on the Daily Palo
Alto is generally considered a
thankless task, hut the experience
which may he derived is consider
able and, aside from any personal
benefit which may be derived, there

is the satisfaction of doing one's
J share in keeping up a necessary
adjunct to student life. All that
is required of an applicant is the
ability to write the English lan
guage and a willingness to work.
