A deep sense of personal loss
came over each individual student
as returning during the past week
he was met with the news of
the death of one of our most
beloved teachers. And this was
because death, in cutting off Dr.
Thoburn in his prime, took from us
something more than an able
speaker, something more than a
competent instructor. It took one
who had found it increasingly his
mission, the longer he was spared
to us, to inspiiv the students through
clas< lecture, Sunday talk, and by
his own earnest yet cheerful pres
ence, to the better life, and to help
by kindly encouragement and
counsel the growing number who
sought him individually for aid.
But though Dr. Thoburn was not
allowed the allotted term of years,
it is in the nature of his work that
it was complete-in itself and that
it will live in the memory of hissiu
dents and friends and bear fruit in
their own added spiritual insight
and their greater influence for good
wherever they may go.
