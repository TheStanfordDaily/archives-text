In today's paper we satisfy tli«-
curiosity aroused l>y the little white
stakes that have been planted sym
metrically upon the chapel site.
To the visitor the quad has always
presented a disappointing Hat ap
pearance, and the beauty of the
buildings has appeared to them
only after they have entered the
inner court. This characteristic
beauty will be in no wise destroyed
but rather enhanced by a chapel
building which, rising above tlx*
rest of the roofs, will afford both
the completing touch and the touch
of contrast that will make the in
terior of the quad perfect. From
the outside, the walls of the new
Library and Assembly Hall have
already done much to add dignity
and variety to the quadrangle.
When these and the corresponding
buildings are completed and the
two are connected by the great arch
which will span the entire roadway
between them, and the w hole facade
is hacked by the imposing tower of
the chapel, the quadrangles will
have achieved most of the inipres
siveness designed for them by the
founders. This is all pleasant, but
even more so is the fact which
these buildings remind us of, that
the University has now at its com
mand the means to supply the
equipment which its growth de
mands. The realization also that
the University is growing so as to
require these enlarged facilities is
in itself gratifying.
