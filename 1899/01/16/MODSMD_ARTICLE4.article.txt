# New Business Manager.
## 
### 
Owing to E. E. Morgan's ab
sence from the University this se
mester, the ofiice of business man
ager of the Daily Palo Alto
became vacant, and the Executive
Committee met as soon as possible
to till the vacancy. After some
discussion, F. W. Smith was chosen
manager of the paper for the en
suing semester. As Mr. Smith was
made editor-in-chief at the last
election, this places the responsi
bility for both editorial and busi
ness management in his hands.
