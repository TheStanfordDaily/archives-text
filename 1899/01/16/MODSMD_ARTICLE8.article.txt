### 
Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger of San
Francisco has been appointed Lect
urer in the department of Bionom
ics. Dr. Voorsanger received the
degree of Rabbi at, Amsterdam in
1873, and that of Doctor of Divin
ity from Cincinnati in 1894, since
which time he lias been Professor
of Semitic Languages and Litera
ture in the University of Califor
nia. He lias held rabbinical sta
tions in Philadelphia and at
Houston, Texas, and since 1886
has been Rabbi of Temple Eman
uel in San Francisco.
Dr. Voorsanger is a man of
varied learning. He lias traveled
in every country of the world ex
cept Australia, and was the dele
gate from the Geographical Society
of the Pacific to the International
Geographical Congress at London
in 1895.
Of his published works probably
the best known are his biography
of Mendelssohn, " Moses Mendels
sohn's Life and Work," and his
" Sketches of a Jewish Family in
Holland," which appeared in ser
ial form. His u Poetical Frag
ments of the Most Ancient Jewish
Literature'' is now in the hands of
the printers, and he is writing
" The Diary of an American
Rabbi."
Through former sermons deliv
ered in the chapel and through the
friendship which he had for the
late Dr. Thoburn, Dr. Voorsanger
has been known and held in high
esteem by Stanfordites, and the
one regret which is felt concerning
his work is that it must be of so
limited a character. His class is
so large that it has been found
necessary to transfer it from the
Chemistry lecture-room to the
chapel.
Mr. John Flesher Newsom, As
sistant Professor of Mining and
Metallurgy in the Geological de
partment, is a former Stanford
student and a graduate of the Uni

and 1895. In the year 1895-6 he
was an instructor in Geology at
Indiana University, rising to the
position of Assistant Professor in

ical plants in the mining regions
of the Northwest.
Professor Newsom comes highly
recommended. Professor Branner
said of him: "His work in Arkan
sas was chiefly upon structural
geology and upon the phosphate
deposits. As Assistant Professor

in the University of Indiana he
began and lias nearly completed a
geological section across the State
of Indiana six miles wide, embrac
ing all the formations from the
lowest to the highest—one of the
most important and comprehens
ive geologic studies ever under
taken in that State."
