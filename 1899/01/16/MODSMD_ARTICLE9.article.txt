# More New Building's.

### 
Perhaps the greatest activity that
ihe University has known since its
founding will begin almost imme
diately upon the campus.
The counterpart of our large
Library and Assembly buildings
will be started at once. These will
be known as the Natural History
buildings. The first to the right of
the memorial arch, which will also
go up with the others, will be used
by the departments of Botany and
Physiology, the Botanical depart
ment on the first floor, the i'hysio
logical above.
The second building will be taken
for Geology on the first floor and
Zoology and Entomology on the
second. Very unique and of gen
eral interest will be the "museum
well" in the Zoology building.
This is to be an open court rising
through the two floors for the dis
play of natural history specimens.
This court will be balconied and
around it will be the laboratories
and lecture rooms. On the first
floor all the geological specimens
will be displayed; on the second,
the zoological and entomological
specimens.
In connection with the Botany
building, plans are under way for
an experimental greenhouse.
The ground plan for the chapel
has been staked out recently and
the new chapel will be completed
before the end of the year.
Connecting the two large build
ings at eacli side of the entrance
will be the long-talked of Memorial
Arch. This will also be erected
before the end of the year.
