# DEBATES AND DEBATERS.
## Interest Among Students and Activity Among Candidates for Both Teams. 
### 
The contestants chosen last se
mester for the semi-finals of the In
tercollegiate Preliminaries have
labored faithfully during the vaca
tion and everything points to a
very successful series of debates
next Thursday, Friday, and Satur
day evenings.
Eight out of the original forty
that entered have withdrawn from
the contest, to the great inconveni
ence of their colleagues. The De
bating Committee attempted to
check this evil by requiring each
contestant to consider himself in
honor bound to remain in the con
test, but their efforts seem to have
been in vain.
The leader of the affirmative in
each debate will be allowed eleven
minutes for his opening speech with
three minutes for rebuttal. All
other speakers will be allowed
twelve minutes.
At the last meeting of the execu
tive committee of the Intersociety
Debating League, Professors New
comer, Fetter, and Spencer were
unanimously re-elected to act as
judges in the semi-finals, owing to
the universal satisfaction that has
been expressed in regard to their
decisions in the Carnot Prelimina
ries.
The limits of choice were en
larged by the committee so that
the judges may choose any number
from two to eight to meet Messrs.
Suzzallo, Ferguson, Hayden, and
Springer, the four Varsity debat
ers, in the finals.
The debates will begin at 7:30 on
Thursday and Friday nights, but
on Saturday evening the first de
bate will begin at 7 sharp on ac
count of the large number of con
testants and the fact that the de
cision will be given on that night.
It is expected that a large num
ber of people will attend the debates
to encourage the speakers.
The following is a list of the
speakers and the questions for the
three evenings:
