cross the baseball grounds, parti
cularly the in Held, is to be severely
condemned. In the present damp

same foot-prints harden with the
dry weather it will cost several
dollars to put the ground in such
condition that the bound of a ball
on an infield hit can be judged
with any degree of accuracy.
