Subscriptions are slowly coming
in to the Training-House Fund in
response to the circular requests
sent out to the alumni, former stu
dents, faculty, and friends of the
University. The '99 Finance Com
mittee is gradually systematizing
the work, and during the semester
will make a canvass of the students
for aid in the project. The Uni
versity is young yet, but there
seems no reason why the united
support of all the forces which can
be brought to bear on the proposi
tion should not prove sufficient to
accomplish the object. The move
ment has been started in the right
way, and, if not successful in the
initial attempt, succeeding classes
may be counted upon to do the
work. As the details of the plan
are formulated full accounts may
be expected in this paper. At pres
ent the chances for success seem
favorable.
