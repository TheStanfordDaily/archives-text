Owing to the new methods in
troduced into the conduct of de
lating affairs at the University
this year, interest has heen actively
aroused; there are more candidates
than ever before, and in every way
debating matters are in a prosper
ous condition. During the vaca
tion, candidates for the Intercol
legiate team have been diligently
preparing for the contests which
extend over the hist three days of
the week, and they will undoubt

edly speak before large and appre
ciative audiences. The question
for the Carnot debate is definitely
announced, so that that team can
now prepare for the final struggle
which will take place in the chapel
in less than a month. On Satur
day the Intercollegiate team, which
will represent us against Berkeley
next April will be chosen. Of the
fact that there is new interest in
debating here there can be no doubt.
Whether this is due to the new
system, the smart of last year's de
feat, or a natural desire to offset a
football tragedy, we do not know.
Perhaps there is a combination of
all these circumstances. At any
rate, the earnestness and enthusi
asm is here; and best of all, the de
baters themselves realize and ap
preciate it. Circumstances alter
cases, and from the present outlook
it does not seem improbable that
Berkeley's old slogan concerning
brains and brawn may be revised
by them this year.
