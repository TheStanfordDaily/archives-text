Circulars for 1899 of the Pacific
Grove Summer School will soon be
ready for distribution. The full
courses of eight weeks will begin
June 19, and close August 11. In
order to suit the convenience of as
many teachers as possible, shorter
courses will be given, lasting six
and four weeks respectively, and
these will begin July 3. Some
aims of the school are: (1) to bring
the schools and colleges in closer
touch with one another; (2) to
give teachers on the Coast the same
opportunities for personal advance
ment that Eastern teachers find in
the summer schools of Clark, Cor
nell, and Chicago Universities; (3)
to give preparatory courses for stu
dents reviewing for the university
examinations; (4) to provide
courses for university students and
others who wish to pursue ad
vanced work, the equivalent of
uni versityjinstruction. Dr. Star
buck will give the work in Educa
tion, Professor Cox in Mathematics,
Professors Goebel and Rendtorff in
German; Dr. Johnston in French,
Spanish, and Italian; Dr. Duniway
in History. From the U. C. faculty
Professor Merrill will give courses
in Latin; Professor Sanford in Eng
lish; Mr. Husband in Greek; and
Professor Hengstler of Hastings will
give courses in Law, preparatory
to the bar examinations.
