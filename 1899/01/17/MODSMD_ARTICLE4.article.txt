# "Shakspere Tea."
## 
### 
The free reading-room in Palo
Alto, now in its third year, has re
cently been moved to larger and
better lighted quarters than those
hitherto occupied. Interest in the
reading-room is wide-spread, and
various movements have been
started recently to maintain and
improve it. A fund for this pur
pose is being largely subscribed to.
The Woman's Club of I'alo Alto
will give a "Shakspere Tea" on
next Saturday afternoon in Frater
nal Hall. A program consisting
largely of songs and selections from
Shakspere's works will be given.
An admission of ten cents will be
charged, the proceeds to be devoted
to the reading-room.
