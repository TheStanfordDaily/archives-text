# Encina Club Meeting.
## 
### 
The first meeting of the Encina
Club this semester was held last
evening with 0. C. Leiter, '99, in the
chair. Treasurer English gave his
report for last semester, showing a
disposition of the funds at the
board's disposal last semester and
a balance in the treasury of $18.
He also brought up the question
of adopting permanent dues of one
dollar each semester; this was
adopted as the future policy of the
club, in order to provide for the
current expenses and also a sur
plus for gradually furnishing the
room.
Chairman Erb of the entertain
ment committee outlined the enter
tainments to be given by the club
during the semester, his report, on
motion, being approved.
The board of directors propose to
devote the funds received from the
dues this semester to refitting the
billiard and pool tables, increasing
the periodical list, giving several
receptions, and, if possible, to make
a beginning in providing comfort
able furnishings for the room. At
the last meeting of the board
Kalin, '02, was elected a member
to represent the Freshman Class.
