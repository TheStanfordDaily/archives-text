Professor Dudley, who was with
Dr. Jordan's party in Mexico, re
turned to the University yesterday.
The rest of the party will return
about the twenty-third. They are
now in the City of Mexico, having
made side trips to Jalapa, Puebla,
and Oriziba. Before leaving Dr.
Jordan will visit Mr Snyder at
Tampico on the Gulf of Mexico,
where he is collecting marine speci
mens for the University. The party
has combined scientific research
with pleasure, and several hitherto
unknown forms of fishes have been
found. All are well and, aside
front a slight railroad accident and
a few colds, nothing has occurred
to mar the enjoyment of the trip.
