With the announcement that
the baseball season begins in a
week comes the hope that the sea
son will open well, and right from
the start move along smoothly. The
apathy of the baseball men always
has been a point upon which the
"croakers" have found fault. The
one and only way for the baseball
men to arouse interest and spirit
among the "rooters" is to put up
lively, snappy practice games and
at no time to allow the interest of
the game to lag among the players.
The captain's call for men should
be answered by every man in the
University who can play the game
and is willing and anxious to de
vote himself conscientiously to the
best interests of the team.
