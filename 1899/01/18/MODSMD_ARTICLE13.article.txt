It lias been said, and truly, that
California's victories in debate dur
ing the past lew years have been
the result of student sentiment
rather than of superiority of ma
terial. There is a real and earnest
interest in the matter among our
rivals across the bay, an interest
that manifests itself not so much
in—metaphorically —"whooping 'er
up on the bleachers" as in working
steadily and quietly toward the
building up of debating interests.
Men who can debate "go in for" de
bating at Berkeley. Seemingly in
ferior material, that would be
passed over here, is brought out
and encouraged, and finally, when
the time of the preliminary or in
tercollegiate debates conies round,
the college in there with a lively
and intelligent interest in the con
test.
J.)o we care for debating here?
Well —yes —in a way. Put the ques
tion to any wild Stanford partisan
and he will admit that he'd like to
see us win, ask who is on the team,
and fall to talking of chances on
the track. We all know well how
many of our representatives who
come to the city for the field-day
go to the theater in the evening in

stead of to the debate llight down
in the bottom of his heart, this
theoretical average Stanford man,
unless he is in a literary society
and has a sort of professional in
terest in the matter, puts debating
far, far below tennis as a form of
intercollegiate contest.
With all the splendid material
in the older teams, we would never
have won a football game had the
college staid indoors while the team
was practicing. The psychic element
is a factor in the success of all
forms of rivalry. And it is doubly
a factor in an intellectual contest.
"Brains and brawn," etc. We
have heard that a great many
times these hist few years. Now
the fact is that debating is a very
poor index of the respective intel
lectual attainments of two student
bodies. It is only after many years,
after our building engineers and
lawyers and scholars have taken a
few falls out of the cold world, that
we can say that Stanford or Cal
ifornia is turning out better
equipped men and women. Debat
ing is only a straw which shows
the drift of our feelings —whether
we prefer the things of the llesh or
the things of the spirit.
