# LAST NIGHT'S LECTURE.
## Illustrated Lecture by G. Wharton James on â€œ The Seven Cities of Cibola and Zuni." 
### 
Mr. G. Wharton James held the
close attention oi his audience for
two hours last night. Secretary
Clark introduced the lecturer say
ing that to the greater portion of
the audience who heard Mr. James'
lecture last semester on the Grand
Canyon of the Colorado, no intro
duction was necessary.
Mr. James is thoroughly ac
quainted with localities treated of
in his lecture and with their his
tory and traditions. The illustra
tions were exceptionally good and
were made more valuable by the
entertaining explanation of the
speaker. The lecture was the more
interesting to Stanford students be
cause Zuni is not far from Acoma
and the Enchanted Mesa of which
Dr. Jordan has spoken in the
chapel. Briefly Mr. James spoke
as follows:
u When the Spaniards began
their wonderful march in our coun
try, they little thought they would
make so much history as they have.
It was pure myth and imagination,
a chimera, a dream, which led t> ese
people to explore the regions they
did.
" In the year 1527, during the
time Cortez and the Spanish ex
plorers were sending back such
strange stories about the wonderful
things they were finding, there was
no wonder that the Spaniards began
sending out expedition after ex
pedition. These explorers began
at Florida after many hardships
and attempted to cross the Gulf of
Mexico. Expedition after expedi
tion failed, and nine years after
the landing at Florida, but a few
haggard, careworn members of
Caboza de Vaca's original band
were left of those who had reached
the Mexican coast and had been
traveling on the continent. From
them the Spaniards in the colonies
heard the first stories of the Seven
Cities which lay ' a little to the
northward.'
" The Spaniards in Florida were
astonished at the stories told by
the wretched survivors and decided
to investigate. They sent out more
explorers with instructions to learn
the exact truth regarding them.
These went to the Cities and saw
the wonderful sight. They did not
explore very thoroughly but re
turned to Florida with enthusiastic
stories but without having accom
plished their mission.
''Now Coronado, a young and
vigorous Spaniard, appeared on the
scene and he was given an army
and sent out under explicit direc
tions to make a thorough examina
tion of the wonderful village of
riches, lie reached Zuni and his
army vanquished its inhabitants.
He found Zuni practically as it is
today and as you will see it in the
pictures I am to show you."
Here Mr. James began presenting
his pictures and he first showed on
the screen a famous "inscription
rock" around which are woven
many interesting incidents and
stories. This rock contained many
very remarkable inscriptions bear
ing on the early life and explorers
of the region, some of which were

made many years ago. They were
shown last night, as the speaker
said, to impress his audience with
the fact that there was history in
America long before the founding
of the colony at St. Augustine and
long before the Declaration of In
dependence.
The next Tuesday evening lec
ture will be by the same gentleman.
The subject will be the " Snake
Dance of the Zuni Indians."
