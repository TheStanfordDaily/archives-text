Cyclers between Palo Alto and
the University are frequently
tempted to use the path dedicated
to pedestrians because of its super
ior condition, much to the annoy
ance of those rightfully belonging
there. This is to be condemned
though not so severely as it would
be were the bicycle path in respect
able condition. The cinders have
proven such an unqualified success
on the pedestrians' path that it is
to be hoped that the other side may
be treated similarly.
