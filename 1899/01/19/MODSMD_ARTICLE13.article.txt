It has remained to the Fresh
men. less bound by shackles of
long continued custom, to take ad
vantage of the present arrangement
of recitation periods and, instead of
calling their class meetings at noon
according to the precedent that has
been observed so long that no
others thought of breaking it, to
hold their meeting at half past four,
when the University work for the
day is over. This is a sensible in
novation and other classes would
do well to follow suit. There are
always some who are kept away
by their work from meetings in the
noon hour, but at 4:30 all who wish
to attend a meeting will find it
possible.
