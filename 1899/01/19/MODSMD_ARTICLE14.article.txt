The Freshmen are not to he
commended so heartily, however,
for their conduct in the meeting
they held yesterday for the nomina
tion of officers. This was the pur
pose of the meeting as announced
and the purpose was carried out
with greater gusto than would have
been necessary if the nominees had
not declined with deplorable unan
imity. For some offices the class
was unable to gel a single nominee
and for others they succeeded only
after a struggle that was ludicrous
in spite of its seriousness. The
motive for many of thedeclinations
was, it is probable, that the nom
inee had aspirations for future
years and did not wish to spoil the
chance of being president at a class
dance by accepting a comparatively
honorless office now. Some of these
will be painfully surprised hy the

workings of the laws of evolution
in class affairs and will regret that
their chance has passed them by and
is gone. But class offices are sup
posed to exist for the facilitation of
class affairs and not for the grati
fication of personal ambition. In
this light such conduct as that
of the Freshmen yesterday is most
regretable.
