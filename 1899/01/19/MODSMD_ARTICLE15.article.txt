One does not look for vestigial
organs in a young organism so
much as in one that has developed
and grown complex through long
periods of existence under varying
conditions. In that case, as the
function of formerly useful parts
may become unnecessary, we may
look for remains and traces of those
parts which may be more or less ;i
nuisance and hindrance to the
present life of the organism, but
unavoidable. Thus in older Eastern
colleges there are various remains
of old customs and ways of doing
things that prove inconvenient now,
but the process of getting rid of
them is found to be slow and often
difficult. Despite the earnest de
sire of nearly everybody concerned,
some colleges are finding it almost
impossible to stamp out the old
methods of hazing simply because
it is felt that hazing is a time
honored tradition. We are making
our traditions —very few have even
begun to harden toward crystalliza
tion yet. College customs are not
only inevitable but altogether de
sirable. A college without some
distinctive customs is unimagin
able, and if an attempt were made
to establish such a college it would
be withoutcustoms because it would
be without attendants. We have
happily avoided burdening ourselves
with any transplanted traditions
which would prove disagreeable.
Rushing never got a fair foothold
and our hazing has always been
within the bounds of gentlemanli
ness. Attempts have been made to
establish customs here which should
be indigenous. Whether indigen
ous customs can be established is a
question, but at any rate they can
not be perpetuated unless they are
maintained by their founders long
enough to be taken up by their suc
cessors. A class should be careful
what customs it endeavors to es
tablish and see that those it does
establish are lived up to. This hits
the Juniors and their plugs. They
started well, but we see no more
plugs.
