### 
The first issue of the Sequoia to
appear after the holidays will he
out tomorrow. It will contain a
short memorial article,, "W. W.
Thoburn," hy Professor A T. Mur
ray. George Bliss Culver contrib
utes a war romance, a pleasant bit
of fiction, about the Stanford boys
in Manila. In shorter sketches
there are two clever things, "In
the Den of the Scribbler'' and
"Sweet is True Love," which are in
light vein. In verse, Will 11. Irwin
contributes a strong sonnet, Joseph
Elmer Wilson furnishing another,
quaint and serious, "To My 'Cello."
The regular departments complete

the issue. Under "Shear Steel" is re
printed from the Dial Katherine
Lee Bates' ''The White Pinnace," a
little poem to the memory of Mary
Sheldon Barnes.
The Sequoia has lately been
achieving some degree of success in
the college press over the country,
and has had much of its matter re
printed in exchange columns. In
late exchanges the following have
appeared: George Herbert Yost's
"The Voice of Poetry," in White
and Gold, Mills College; Leslie Har
rison's "Quandary," in the S. C. A.
Bulletin, Ann Arbor, and News Let
ter, Johns Hopkins; "Morning Fog,"
in the S. C. A. Bulletin, and "At
Sunset," in the Tennessee Magazine,
University of Tennessee; Laura B.
Everett's ''Priest and Puet" and
C. L. Story's "Sonnet," in Unit,
Grinnell College, lowa. The Kai
min, University of Montana, Tulane
Collegian, Tulane University, New
Orleans, and many others have
used Carolus jAger's "Fate," which
was reprinted in an early issue.
Among the comments the follow
ing may be significant: The Normal
Record from Chico speaks of the
magazine's "distinctly literary
tone." The Elizabeth Chronicle
from North Carolina says:"It is an
exponent of the breezy West and
brings dainty verse and clever sto
riettes. There is no lack of exu
berant life." The Tulane Collegian
says: "Stanford University enjoys
the distinction of being one of the
very few colleges which produces a
weekly literary magazine. The Se
quoia possesses that element of in
structive literary matter, inter
spersed with witty and interesting
departments, which makes its every
appearance eagerly awaited." The
Brunonian of Brown University
says: "We like to keep in touch
with the Far West by reading the
Sequoia." It recommends the Se
quoia's policy to several Eastern
weeklies.
