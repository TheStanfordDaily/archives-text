### 
The King's Daughters held a pre
liminary meeting in room 23 on
Tuesday. On next Tuesday in the
same room at one o'clock they
hope to see all who have belonged
to any King's Daughters circle,
and all others who are interested in
the work. The leader for the se
mester, Miss T. L. SSwanson, will
outline the work for the remainder
of the year.
