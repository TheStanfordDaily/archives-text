# LAST NIGHT'S DEBATES.
## First Two Preliminaries Interesting and Succesful.— Saturday's Candidates. 
### 
The tirst session of the semi-finals
of the Intercollegiate debate was
held last night in the chapel. Pro
fessor Whittier presided. He ex
plained t. e nature and object of the
semi-finals and spoke briefly of the
benefits which the new system of
choosing debating teams has al
ready produced. Two years ago
eighteen contested in the Intercol
legiate preliminaries, last year
twenty-eight, and this year about
forty are trying. Professor Whit
tier then read the following instruc
tions to the judges:
"From the contestants appearing
before the judges in the present
finals, which consist of six debates
held at three sessions, the judges
shall choose a number of the best
debaters to enter the finals from
which the Intercollegiate team will
be chosen.
"The number so chosen shall be
two or eight or any intermediate
number, at the option of the
judges.
"The number shall be preferably,
but not necessarily, two, four, six,
or eight, so that when joined by the
four Varsity candidates already
admitted to the finals the contes
tants in the finals shall be even
numbered and divisible into equal
sides."
The first debate was upon the
subject, "Resolved, that the United
States should construct and operate
the Nicaragua Canal."
C. M. Marrack, '01, was the first
speaker on the affirmative. Ac
knowledging the responsibilities
which we would assume, he showed
the benefits which would accrue to
commerce, the impossibility of the
Panama Canal and the practica
bility of the Nicaragua route, and,
in his rebuttal, the impossibility of
international control.
Mi '•ts T. L. Swanson, '99, followed
on the negative. Her argument
was especially good. She admitted
the need for the canal, but opposed
its being owned and operated by a
single government. The two alter
natives were shown of Anglo-Amer
ican or international co-operation.
The second speaker on the af
firmative was L. R. Wickersham,
'00. He argued the national and
commercial benefits which would
accrue to our government.
Miss Gwendolyn Stewart was the
last on the negative. That the
United States has become a world
power, she contended, is a reason
that we should share the canal's
construction with other nations.
The second debate, contested by
five speakers, was upon the subject,
"Resolved, That, if the United
States retains any territory ac
quired in the recent war, she should
accord to oilier nations equal com
mercial privileges with herself."
W. A. Morris, '01, was the first
speaker. He urged the weight of
President McKinley's favoring the
opening of trade in our new posses
sions to all nations. His argu
ment was strong and, in his rebut
tal, he neatly turned an opponent's
remarks.
S. M. Cuthbertson, '00, was the
first speaker on the negative. He

showed the impossibility of the
open-door policy in Porto Rico and
contended that that destroyed the
affirmative's contention.
The second speaker on the nega
tive was C. N. Riggins, '99. The
United States should have trade
advantages in return for her ex
penditures, was his contention.
J. F. English, '01, followed on
the affirmative. His argument was
especially strong and well delivered.
He declared that the United States
is entering upon a new policy and,
to avoid the hostility of Europe,
must not discriminate in trade ad
vantages.
11. 0. Hadley, '01, closed for the
negative. His humor, picturing
the islander as a corruptible youth,
was especially effective.

Owing to the number of contest
ants who speak in the Prelimina
ries tomorrow evening, the first de
hate will start promptly at 7 o'clock.
Lt is imperative, in order to give
everybody an opportunity to speak
well, that no one enter the chapel
while a speaker has the floor, and
in view of this the Intersociety
executive committee especially re
quests that persons remain outside
until intermissions.
Professor Duniway will preside
during the evening, and at the
close of the second debate %he
judges, Professors Spencer, Fetter,
and Green, will name the success
ful candidates from all the Prelim
inaries, who will be entitled to com
pete with the Varsity debaters for
a place on the Intercollegiate team.

question," Resolved, That the LJ nited
