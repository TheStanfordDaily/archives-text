# BECKETT VERY ILL.
## A 						Sudden Change for the Worse.â€” Operation for Appendicitis Necessary. 
### 
George M. Beckett, '00, captain of
the Varsity baseball team, now lies
in a precarious condition on the
fourth lloor of Encina Hall.
I)r. Stillman, the surgery special
ist, arrived on the 3:49 train and
after an examination of the patient
held a consultation with Dr. Wood,
the result of which was the an
nouncement that as Dr. Wood had
stated, Beckett was suffering from
appendicitis. It was thought that
the appendix had burst.
As soon as the consultation was
ended the sick man was informed
of his condition and upon the ad
vice of the physicians prepared to
submit himself to the necessary
operation.
He was removed to the fourth
floor in the southeast wing of En
cina, where the operation, by the
time this paper goes to press, has
already taken place.
Although weak from lack of food,
of which he has been unable to par
take during the last two days,
Beckett is in good condition to
stand the ordeal, the outcome of
which is in no way assured.
Beckett's father will arrive from
the South on the 3:49 train tomor
row.
