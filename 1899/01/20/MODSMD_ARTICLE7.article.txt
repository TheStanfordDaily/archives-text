The business manager of the
1900 Annual is experiencing the
same difficulty in collecting class
assessments as has been met with
by former managers, and conse
quently is being hampered in his
work to no inconsiderable degree.
The members of the class do not
seem to realize that managers are
elected to do business, and that the
latter, if it be done well, takes
money. It would be well if a class
could institute a custom, hitherto
unknown here, of promptly fur
nishing the money they vote for
class purposes.
