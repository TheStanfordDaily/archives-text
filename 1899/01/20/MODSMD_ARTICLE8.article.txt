The lamentable condition of our
musical clultß is a mutter of deep
concern to the whole student body.
We tnke pride in an excellent glee
and mandolin club, just as much
as in a winning athletic team, for
both are equally representative of
the University, though in a differ
ent way. It is with regret, then,
that we find but n bare quarter of
the total membership of the clubs
attending the first meeting of the
year. We like to hear the clubs
and we admit their recognized
place in college and class exercises.
Then, too, there are such projects
as the building of the training
house, theatricals, and other enter
prises on hand —all of which re
quire the assistance of the musical
talent of the University. But
while we desire their assistance we
seldom recognize the gre;it amount
of time and arduous labor which
must constantly be devoted, if the

organizations hope to attain any
thing like perfection. We hope
the clubs will find a way to weather
their present difficulties and attain
their former standard of excellence.
