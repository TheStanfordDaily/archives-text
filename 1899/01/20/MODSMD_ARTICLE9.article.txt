The attendance at the Prelimina
ries last night was gratifying to
every one interested in debating.
Although vacant seats formed a
conspicuous part of the audience,
nevertheless when we consider that
it was Thursday night, that these
debates are only preliminary to the
final try-out, and that larger crowds
will probably be present tonight
and tomorrow night, we plainly
recognize a wholesome awakening
by the student hotly to the impor
tance of our debating interests. At
the close of the contests tomorrow
evening the judges will name not
less than two nor more than eight
speakers, who will compete with
our Varsity debaters for a place on
the Intercollegiate team. None of
the literary societies will meet to
morrow evening, and the chapel
should be crowded to hear the clos
ing debate of the series and to receive
the decision of the judges.
