# PRELIMINARIES CLOSED
## Eight Debaters Selected to Compete with the Four Varsity Men in the Finals. 
### 
.lust before 11 o'lock Saturday
night Professor Fetter, by the light
of a candle, read the decision of
the judges at the Intercollegiate
preliminaries, designating J. A.
Cummings,'ol, William Edlin, '02,
J. F. English, '01, R. E. Filcher,
'99, Miss A. G. Fraser, '00, Duncan
Mckinnon, '99, Charles Quayle, '00,
and A. C. W hi taker, 99, as the suc
cessful contestants in the series of
debates, who are now qualified to
meet Messrs. Ferguson, Hay den,
Springer, and Suzzallo in the finals
for places on the Intercollegiate
team.
The comparatively large attend
ance at the contests last week, be
ginning with a good audience
Thursday night and increasing on
Friday and Saturday, demon
strated the approval of our new
system by the students generally,
while the number of the debaters
brought out and the quality of their
work demonstrated the wisdom of
the system now in use.
The first debate Friday night was
upon the subject, "Resolved, That
the English cabinet system is better
adapted to the American govern
ment than the present Congres
sional system."
P. B. Anspacher, '00, opened the
debate, maintaining that in the
cabinet system every member is
responsible to the people and to his
party for measures proposed by
him, but that in the congressional
system he holds his position with
out having to answer to any one.
G. J. Cochran, '00, traced the de
velopementof the American system,
emphasized the successful growth
of our government under it, and
contended that the cabinet system
brings untrained men into power.
A. C. Whitaker argued that there
is too much machinery in the
American systei.i, that the English
system is more efficient, and insisted
that its responsible nature is the
strongest virtue ot the cabinet sys
tem. lie refuted the claim that the
American people are vacillating.
His speech was especially clear-cut
both in ideas and expression.
Miss Fraser, '00, argued that the
American people are subject to un
wise gusts of passion, which have
only been curbed and checked by
the successful mechanism of our
governmental plan. Conditions in
Great Britain are adapted to their
system, but such a plan of govern
ment would expose the country to
destructive and ridiculous vacilla
tion. Miss Fraser made an in
cis ve and aggressive argument.
The second question was worded
its follows: ''Resolved, That it would
be to our interests, admitting that
the United States is entering upon
a policy of expansion, to enter into
a formal alliance with England."
.i. A. Cummings, '01, laid down
three propositions as the basis for
the affirmative argument: that the
United States should become a
great commercial nation, that to do
so she must maintain the ''open
door" in the Phillipines, and that
this policy demands co-operation
with England. An Anglo-Amer
ican alliance is essential for the

protection of mutual interests in
the East, and on the Pacific against
Russia, Germany, and France.
Beach, '00, claimed that we
should not scatter our energies
by speading out before we have our
domestic problems solved. The I
common language of England and
America is a mere accident of his
tory; the majority of Americans
are descendants from continental
Europe and Ireland. Great Britain
has changed her attitude toward us
because she needs our assistance.
B. E. Page, '99, stated that the
desire of continental Europe is to
oppose England to America. An
Anglo-American union would con
trol the industrial interests of the
world and would protect and assist
the weak against tlie strong. Mr.
Page said that these two nations,
with common language, religion,
standard of morals, and business
interests, must support each other.
R. .J. Sterrett, '02, argued that
England wants to ally us to her
self in order to promote her trade in
China. If we imitate the English
policy of imperialism with colonies,
it means imperialism at home.
This alliance would compel us to
maintain a great army and navy
to help England in her troubles.
Mr. Sterrett's choice of words and
breadth of information were the
strongest features of his address.
The first question Saturday night
was, ''Resolved, That the United
States is justified in departing from
her past policy of isolation."
Duncan Mackinnon, '99, leader
of the affirmative, conceded that
the policy of isolation was wise
when our country was small and
weak, but by growth, expansion,
and acquisition we have reached a
point where this is no longer advis
able. Our government departed
from this policy when it declared
the independence of Cuba and in
vited war with Spain. We want
the trade of China and must neces
sarily make ourselves felt as a
power away from home.
R. E. Filcher, '99, asserted that
although there might be some inci
dental enlargement of commerce
brought about by expansion, it
would not be worth the cost for
navy, army, and civil service. The
new policy will necessitate govern
ment without the consent of the
governed.
C. S. Chandler, '99, continued for
the nffirmative. He argued that
we have filled up the lands in
America and have already become
a manufacturing nation.
11. W. Grunsky, '99, stated that
the retention of coaling stations is
not inconsistent with isolation, for
we have always held stations. We
can compete with England and the
world in any market. When
needed we can, as we have in the
past, give our moral support to
England in keeping ports open,
but we must take warning from
the failure of Russia and Germany
in their attempts to become world
powers.
11. P. Everett continued the ar
gument that America has grown so
far that old restrictions are no
longer binding.
J. T. Nourse, '00, argued that
the United States must remain
alone for self defense: She cannot

take in the proposed new territory
without exposing her sugar indus
try and other interests to ruinous
competition. Under the constitu
tion, it is impossible to hold any
land as colonies or to maintain an
open door. We cannot annex new
possessions except for the purposes
of statehood, an extremely unde
sirable prospect in this instance.
On the second debate of the
evening, the last of the series of
six, there were eight speakers. The
question was, " Resolved that the
United States should annex the
Philippines."
E. I). Holly, '00, said that the
islands had fallen into our hands
and that we are responsible to
them for a government. Control
of them would give us an oppor
tunity to play our part in the
world's commerce which is being
built up on the Pacific.
\V. E. Dickson, '00, maintained
that our governmental machinery
and the temperament of the nation
are not adapted to annexation.
Retention would entail vast ex
pense, for which we could get no
benefit in return, while the Philip
pines themselves object to any
such arrangement.
Geo. H. Yost, '99, argued that
it would be wrong to give the gov
ernment to the natives, for they
are incapable. To establish a pro
tectorate or to dispose of the arch
ipelago would not be consistent
with our honor; therefore as the
only alternative, we are in duty
bound to hold the islands.
J. E. Wilson, '01, contended for
the Monroe Doctrine. Expansion
will weaken us, lay us open to at
tack, and render us vulnerable in
case of war.
C. H. King, '01, stated that we
must look into the future for our
own interests, and at the same
time perform our assumed respon
sibility of giving the Philip
pines a state government and
thorough development. We should
secure in them an outlet for our
idle labor and accumulated capital.
E. T. Maples, '99, argued that
annexation involves the setting
aside of the ideals upon which our
government is founded. If we hold
the islands we must educate the
natives, a tremendous expense that
brings no reward. Colonies would
not guarantee to us our export
trade, as is plainly shown in the
case of England.
Charles Quayle, '00, reviewed the
history and growth of our country,
maintaining that annexation is
consistent with our past policy. It
is not only right, but our duty to
extend our government to these
islands of the East.
William Edlin, '02, placed the
question under the two headings,
moral and economic, and con
tended that we have no moral
right, and are under no obligation,
to subject the Philippines. He ac
counted for the "loudly proclaimed
sentiment in favor of annexation
as emanating solely from capital
ists who see great opportunities for
investment in which they can take
advantage of the low standard of
I life among the natives to pay
pauper wages and to ruin the
j American wage earner and indus
try through competition.

to help England in her troubles.
Mr. Sterrett's choice of words and
breadth of information were the
strongest features of his address.
The first question Saturday night
was, ''Resolved, That the United
States is justified in departing from
her past policy of isolation."
Duncan Mackinnon, '99, leader
of the affirmative, conceded that
the policy of isolation was wise
when our country was small and
weak, but by growth, expansion,
and acquisition we have reached a
point where this is no longer advis
able. Our government departed
from this policy when it declared
the independence of Cuba and in
vited war with Spain. We want
the trade of China and must neces
sarily make ourselves felt as a
power away from home.
R. E. Filcher, '99, asserted that
although there might be some inci
dental enlargement of commerce
brought about by expansion, it
would not be worth the cost for
navy, army, and civil service. The
new policy will necessitate govern
ment without the consent of the
governed.
C. S. Chandler, '99, continued for
the nffirmative. He argued that
we have filled up the lands in
America and have already become
a manufacturing nation.
11. W. Grunsky, '99, stated that
the retention of coaling stations is
not inconsistent with isolation, for
we have always held stations. We
can compete with England and the
world in any market. When
needed we can, as we have in the
past, give our moral support to
England in keeping ports open,
but we must take warning from
the failure of Russia and Germany
in their attempts to become world
powers.
11. P. Everett continued the ar
gument that America has grown so
far that old restrictions are no
longer binding.
J. T. Nourse, '00, argued that
the United States must remain
alone for self defense: She cannot

take in the proposed new territory
without exposing her sugar indus
try and other interests to ruinous
competition. Under the constitu
tion, it is impossible to hold any
land as colonies or to maintain an
open door. We cannot annex new
possessions except for the purposes
of statehood, an extremely unde
sirable prospect in this instance.
On the second debate of the
evening, the last of the series of
six, there were eight speakers. The
question was, " Resolved that the
United States should annex the
Philippines."
E. I). Holly, '00, said that the
islands had fallen into our hands
and that we are responsible to
them for a government. Control
of them would give us an oppor
tunity to play our part in the
world's commerce which is being
built up on the Pacific.
\V. E. Dickson, '00, maintained
that our governmental machinery
and the temperament of the nation
are not adapted to annexation.
Retention would entail vast ex
pense, for which we could get no
benefit in return, while the Philip
pines themselves object to any
such arrangement.
Geo. H. Yost, '99, argued that
it would be wrong to give the gov
ernment to the natives, for they
are incapable. To establish a pro
tectorate or to dispose of the arch
ipelago would not be consistent
with our honor; therefore as the
only alternative, we are in duty
bound to hold the islands.
J. E. Wilson, '01, contended for
the Monroe Doctrine. Expansion
will weaken us, lay us open to at
tack, and render us vulnerable in
case of war.
C. H. King, '01, stated that we
must look into the future for our
own interests, and at the same
time perform our assumed respon
sibility of giving the Philip
pines a state government and
thorough development. We should
secure in them an outlet for our
idle labor and accumulated capital.
E. T. Maples, '99, argued that
annexation involves the setting
aside of the ideals upon which our
government is founded. If we hold
the islands we must educate the
natives, a tremendous expense that
brings no reward. Colonies would
not guarantee to us our export
trade, as is plainly shown in the
case of England.
Charles Quayle, '00, reviewed the
history and growth of our country,
maintaining that annexation is
consistent with our past policy. It
is not only right, but our duty to
extend our government to these
islands of the East.
William Edlin, '02, placed the
question under the two headings,
moral and economic, and con
tended that we have no moral
right, and are under no obligation,
to subject the Philippines. He ac
counted for the "loudly proclaimed
sentiment in favor of annexation
as emanating solely from capital
ists who see great opportunities for
investment in which they can take
advantage of the low standard of
I life among the natives to pay
pauper wages and to ruin the
j American wage earner and indus
try through competition.
.lust before 11 o'lock Saturday
night Professor Fetter, by the light
of a candle, read the decision of
the judges at the Intercollegiate
preliminaries, designating J. A.
Cummings,'ol, William Edlin, '02,
J. F. English, '01, R. E. Filcher,
'99, Miss A. G. Fraser, '00, Duncan
Mckinnon, '99, Charles Quayle, '00,
and A. C. W hi taker, 99, as the suc
cessful contestants in the series of
debates, who are now qualified to
meet Messrs. Ferguson, Hay den,
Springer, and Suzzallo in the finals
for places on the Intercollegiate
team.
The comparatively large attend
ance at the contests last week, be
ginning with a good audience
Thursday night and increasing on
Friday and Saturday, demon
strated the approval of our new
system by the students generally,
while the number of the debaters
brought out and the quality of their
work demonstrated the wisdom of
the system now in use.
The first debate Friday night was
upon the subject, "Resolved, That
the English cabinet system is better
adapted to the American govern
ment than the present Congres
sional system."
P. B. Anspacher, '00, opened the
debate, maintaining that in the
cabinet system every member is
responsible to the people and to his
party for measures proposed by
him, but that in the congressional
system he holds his position with
out having to answer to any one.
G. J. Cochran, '00, traced the de
velopementof the American system,
emphasized the successful growth
of our government under it, and
contended that the cabinet system
brings untrained men into power.
A. C. Whitaker argued that there
is too much machinery in the
American systei.i, that the English
system is more efficient, and insisted
that its responsible nature is the
strongest virtue ot the cabinet sys
tem. lie refuted the claim that the
American people are vacillating.
His speech was especially clear-cut
both in ideas and expression.
Miss Fraser, '00, argued that the
American people are subject to un
wise gusts of passion, which have
only been curbed and checked by
the successful mechanism of our
governmental plan. Conditions in
Great Britain are adapted to their
system, but such a plan of govern
ment would expose the country to
destructive and ridiculous vacilla
tion. Miss Fraser made an in
cis ve and aggressive argument.
The second question was worded
its follows: ''Resolved, That it would
be to our interests, admitting that
the United States is entering upon
a policy of expansion, to enter into
a formal alliance with England."
.i. A. Cummings, '01, laid down
three propositions as the basis for
the affirmative argument: that the
United States should become a
great commercial nation, that to do
so she must maintain the ''open
door" in the Phillipines, and that
this policy demands co-operation
with England. An Anglo-Amer
ican alliance is essential for the

protection of mutual interests in
the East, and on the Pacific against
Russia, Germany, and France.
Beach, '00, claimed that we
should not scatter our energies
by speading out before we have our
domestic problems solved. The I
common language of England and
America is a mere accident of his
tory; the majority of Americans
are descendants from continental
Europe and Ireland. Great Britain
has changed her attitude toward us
because she needs our assistance.
B. E. Page, '99, stated that the
desire of continental Europe is to
oppose England to America. An
Anglo-American union would con
trol the industrial interests of the
world and would protect and assist
the weak against tlie strong. Mr.
Page said that these two nations,
with common language, religion,
standard of morals, and business
interests, must support each other.
R. .J. Sterrett, '02, argued that
England wants to ally us to her
self in order to promote her trade in
China. If we imitate the English
policy of imperialism with colonies,
it means imperialism at home.
This alliance would compel us to
maintain a great army and navy
to help England in her troubles.
Mr. Sterrett's choice of words and
breadth of information were the
strongest features of his address.

was, ''Resolved, That the United
