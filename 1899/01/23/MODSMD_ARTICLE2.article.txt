# BURR CLARK CHAMBERLAIN.
## Again a Yale Man Has Been Selected to Coach Our Football Team. 
### 
Football Manager Berry has se
lected another Yale man to coach
the Stanford football team, Burr
Clark Chamberlain, captain and
left tackle of last season's team.
During . the recent vacation
Treasurer Fickert was in the East
and looked over the whole field for
the proper man* to take charge of
our eleven next season. He visited
Camp and Cross and discussed the
situation with them and with Stan
ford alumni in Harvard and Col
umbia, and after a thorough inves
tigation, returned and reported his
conclusions to Manager Berry and
upon the basis of this report
Chamberlain has been secured.
Chamberlain is considered one of
the three best captains and leaders
of elevens in the East this year,
the other two being Dibblee of
Harvard and Hare of Pennsyl
vania. He is well qualified to
coach the eleven in all its posi
tions, as he has played center, end,
half-back and tackle, all success
fully and is beside a very accurate
and skillful punter. This was es
pecially spoken of this year by
Camp when he made up his all-
America team on which Chamber
lain was left tackle. This is the
second season he has been placed
on the all-America eleven.
