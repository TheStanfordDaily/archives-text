Again Stanford will put her trust
in a Yale man with .Yale methods
to turn out the best team the col
lege can produce. Walter Camp
gave us our first lesson in football
and ever since we have felt that a
man from his college best suited
our requirements so that the mere
announcement, that the coach is
a Yale man gives every Stanford
enthusiast satisfaction. Burr Clark
Chamberlain is from Yale, a gentle
man, an all round football player,
and a leader of men. It will, no
doubt, be as it always has been, a
Yale man who comes to us and a
Stanford man who leaves us.
