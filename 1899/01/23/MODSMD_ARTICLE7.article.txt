Among the customs that seem in
a fair way to become established
here is that of ttie annual reception
by the Encina Club to the women
of the University. The invitations
have been issued for the third reg
ular reception, and, if former affairs
of the kind can be taken as a cri
terion, the success of next Friday
night is already assured. Persons
who c nne from other colleges have
insisted that we are sadly deficient
in the social amenities. Of course,
there is the possibility of having
too much of this sort of thing, but
at present there is no such danger.
The danger is rather the other
wayâ€”that the different organic
parts of the student body are not
in close enough communion; that
as individuals we are too self
centered.
