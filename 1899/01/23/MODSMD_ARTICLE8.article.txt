The attendance at the debates
week was extremely gratifying
to the speakers and in fact to all
who have the interests of debating
at heart. It was a further evidence
of the awakening that has come to
us in this line during the past year
and of the fact that the improve
ments in our debating system re
cently made are in the line of pro
gress.
One noticeable thing about these
debates, however, was the poor re
cord made in point of attendance
on the part of the faculty. Hut one
or two of its members in addition
to the judges were present on any

of the three evenings. We will ad
mit that preliminary debates at
Stanford have at times heretofore
been rather prosy affairs hut cer
tainly those just passed were inter
esting from beginning to end. And
at any event it does seem that the
professors should join a little more
heartily with the students in their
endeavors to put forensic contests
on a par with the best of the coun
try, at best the extent of encourag
ing them by being present at the
two annual sets of preliminaries. If
they do that they will be better
able to give that helpful criticism
to the debaters which is due from
them.
