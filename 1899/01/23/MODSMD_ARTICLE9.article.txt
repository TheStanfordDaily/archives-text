With the formal withdrawal of
the only candidate for president,
the freshmen now stand without an
aspirant for the greatest honor
which a class may confer upon any
one of its members. And not only
is it an honor to be president of one's
class, but it is a duty as well, a
duty which the best men of the
class should willingly seek. The
Class of 1902 seems to be without
any idea of what class spirit is, and
furthermore, it will never know
until good men are elected to direct
the efforts of the class. The fresh
men do not seem to realize that
their attempts to run their class
affairs are the laughing stock of
the University. They do not seem
to know that classes, like men, are
not born with an innate capacity
to conduct and govern themselves
in the most efficient manner. They
cannot realize that they should be
gaining valuable experience now
which will most certainly be needed
in future years, instead of fritter
ing away valuable time in poorly
attended class meetings, whose ac
tions savor of the nursery. The
freshmen class should take a brace,
call a class meeting, get down to
solid work, and show the student
body that it has the stuff worthy of
its University.
