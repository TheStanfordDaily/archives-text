# PRESIDENT JORDAN RETURNS.
## The 						Five Weeks Spent in Mexico a Season of Pleasure to Those Who Took the Trip. 
### 
President Jordan and party have
returned from their holiday excur
sion to Mexico after having had a
thoroughly delightful trip and see
ing a considerable number of the
interesting sights of the southern
republic. Those who remained
with the party throughout the trip
were absent from the University
about five weeks, having started on
December 17. They were Dr. and
Mrs. Jordan, Professor W. R.
Dudley, J. E. McDowell, John O.
Snyder, C. L. Story, of the Univer
sity; Mr. W. T. Reid, head master
of Belmont School; George M. Bow
man, Mrs. S. F. Leib, Miss Elna
Leib, and Miss Edna Bowman, of
San Jose; Mr. and Mrs. J. S. Butler
of Palo Alto, and Mr. E. C. Ely of
St. Matthew's School.
Dr. Jordan says that while they
by no means pretended to see Mexico
in five weeks, they learned a great
deal of the native people and their
economic and social conditions.
When away from the railroads
they traveled on horseback, experi
menting but for one day with the
burros. One very pleasant day
was spent at a hacienda as the
guests of Senor Tuesta, one of the
wealthiest planters of Mexico. On
another day Dr. Jordan and Mr.
Bowman had an interesting visit
with President Diaz, whom Dr.
Jordan thinks to be without ques
tion the greatest ruler of any coun
try. President Diaz has been at
the head of the government of
Mexico for the past twenty years
and during that time he has given
to his country everything it pos
sesses of real stability. The party
visited the following cities and
towns: Guanajuato, Iraputo, Guad
alajara, Mexico, Cuernavaca,
Puente de Ixtla, Puebla, Chobula,
Tlaxcala, Orizaba, Cordoba, Vera
Cruz, Jalapa, Xico, and Zacatecas.
John 0. Snyder, instructor in
Zoology, who went on the trip with
the express purpose of collecting
fishes from the Gulf of Mexico
around Vera Cruz for the zoological
museum, went to Tampico instead
of to Vera Cruz on account of the
presence of yellow fever in the
latter place. Tampico is on the
Gulf of Mexico, north of Vera Cruz,
and is as good a place as Vera
Cruz for collecting purposes. Mr.
Snyder will remain there as long as
he can still find desirable speci
mens.
Dr. Jordan will deliver a lecture
on his Mexican trip in ' the chapel
within a short time.
