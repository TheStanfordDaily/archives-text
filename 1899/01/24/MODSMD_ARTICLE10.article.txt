The Senior Class enters upon its
final semester with the brightest
prospects of a graduating class for
several years. With officers elected
in a friendly contest which will
leave no bitterness nor lack of har
mony, without the burden of an
Annual debt of several hundred
dollars, the class has made an ex
cellent beginning for establishing
an enviable record as a senior class.
In addition a start has been made
for laying down a precedent for
future classes in regard to leaving
the University some permanent
memorial of their career as a class
organization, when they come back
no more. It is in this respect that
the Class of '99 has a chance to be
unique, and it was certainly a
novel enterprise for a class to un
dertake the initial raising of a fund

for erecting on ihe campus a train
ing house for University athletic
teams. Such a large movement
demands the energies of a large
number of people working in unity,
and it is doubtful whether a smaller
body than a university class could
carry it through successfully. Ac
tive work in enlisting the co-opera
tion of alumni, faculty, friends, and
students must be accomplished be
fore the project can be made an
actual fact.
The financial direction of the
movement has been placed in the
hands of the class finance com
mittee and thus far requests for aid
have gone only to the alumni and
faculty, but the support of the stu
dent body is now to be asked.
Every one should look ahead and
adjust his finances with the ex
pectation of giving some assistance
to the fund, which has assumed a
universal character. By support
ing the class entertainments and
offering support, a united effort on
the part of the Senior Class, aided
by the whole body of students, will
undoubtedly result in adding to
our University buildings this neces
sary adjunct before the opening of
the next football season.
