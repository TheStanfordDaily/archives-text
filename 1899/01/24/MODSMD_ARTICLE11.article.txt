The authorities of Dartmouth are
carrying out a general plan of giv
ing the college a typical old New
England appearance. Thus, in
doing over four of the halls this
season they have painted them yel
low and white and furnished them
with green blinds.
The catalogue of Williams Col
lege for 1898-99 contains the larg
est enrollment of students in the
history of the collegeâ€”a total of
385. Although the college is dis
tinctively a Massachusetts institu
tion, that State contributes only 106
undergraduates, as against 155 from
New York.
Professor Josiah Royce of Har
vard, who visited Stanford last
year, sailed January 2d for Eng
land to fill bis engagement to de
liver the Gifford lectures on the
"Philosophy of Religion" at the
University of Aberdeen. These lec
tures are ten in number. Each
lecturer invited to give the lectures
is engaged for two years. Many
men noted in philosophy and reli
gion have been invited to deliver
them, but Professor Royce is the
first American to receive the honor.
The Harvard Crimson has col
lected in pamphlet form its sketches
of Harvard students who were in
the army or navy during the Span
ish war. Between four and five
hundred graduates and undergrad
uates, largely the latter, were in
service. (Jf these some were regu
lars; many were with the Rough
Riders and were particularly com
mended by Colonel Roosevelt;
others were in Porto Rico and
Manila. Over a third were promoted
during the continuance of hostili
ties, and nearly all were under fire.
Ten men died.
