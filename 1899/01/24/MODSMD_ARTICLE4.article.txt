# BECKETT IMPROVING.
## He is Past the Most Critical Stage and is Almost Entirely Out of Danger. 
### 
Geo. M. Beckett has been lying
in a very precarious condition since
Friday evening when Dr. Stillman
operated upon him for appendicitis.
When the appendix was removed
it was on the verge of bursting,and
already some of the poison gener
ated had oozed out, thus making
the danger of peritonitis very great.
A hard substance, one fourth of an
inch long, was found inside.
Last night Beckett had the best
rest since the operation, with the
exception of a slight fever which
indicated peritonitis. The fever
has left him today, and barring ac
cidents he now has a fair chance of
recovery. Friday night and Sat
urday morning he rested well, but
Saturday afternoon he was attacked
by a chill and suffered a severe re
lapse that for two hours looked as
though it would be fatal. Saturday
night he was restless and semi
delirious from the effects of mor
phine. Sunday he suffered in
tensely all day, but exhibited no
bad symptoms. .Nearly all of Sun
day night he was extremely nervous
and could only be kept quiet by
means of strong opiates. His suf
fering was frightful. The last of
these drugs was administered at
4 a.m. Monday, and since that time
he has been given milder medicines.
He is past the most critical stage.
The patient has constantly been
under the care of Miss Turner, the
trained nurse, and "Billy" McLeod.
Yesterday another nurse was se
cured from the city to assist them.
On Saturday afternoon Beckett's
family, his father, mother, three
sisters, and a little brother, arrived
from their home in Arroyo Grande
and are now occupying rooms on
the fourth floor at Encina, adjoin
ing the sick room. The boys of
Encina have been eager to lend all
possible assistance.
Dr. Stillman returned to San
Francisco Saturday morning, and
left the case in charge of Dr. Wood
until he conies back to change the
dressing on the wound.
5 p.m. â€” Beckett passed a good
day, resting quietly, and sleeping
much of the afternoon. Except for
some unexpected relapse, he is now
considered almost out of danger.
Dr. Stillman will be down in a
few days to remove the dressing
and close the wound.
