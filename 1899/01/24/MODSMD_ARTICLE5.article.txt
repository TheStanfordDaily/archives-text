## 
### 
"diet" Thomas, '98, Varsity
tackle for two years, now first ser
geant, in Company K, First Cali
fornia Volunteers, is home on a
ninety days' furlough. He arrived
in the city Wednesday morning on
the Ohio and spent Friday on the
campus, leaving Saturday for Los
Angeles where his mother is sick.
He was in the hospital when his
furlough was granted, hut the ocean
trip has heen of great benefit to
him so that he has regained nearly
all of the ninety pounds that he
lost in Manila.
Thomas enlisted as a private,
hut has heen gradually promoted
to his present rank. He led his
squad with conspicuous bravery in
the trenches at Manila where he

had his gun shot out of his hands.
His account of this fight as well as
of the whole campaign is exceed
ingly interesting and realistic.
He brings news from the Stan
ford men in the army all of whom
are thoroughly tired of the life and
are longing for a chance to get
to America.
He says all the Stanford men are
are out of the hospital except
Corbusier who will return to the
United States as soon as he is
strong enough. Nearly all the
men have been more or less seri
ously sick except "Guiby" Dole and
" Babe" Burnett who have grown
healthier and heavier.
Fry who was so sick that the
army physicians all gave him up
was nursed so successfully by
Leavitt and Wrigley that he has
entirely recovered and is now tak
ing a trip over the island with
Wrigley. Wrigley has proven such
a good nurse that he may go into
the hospital corps when he returns.
Thomas has more detailed in
formation about the Thanksgiving
banquet and of the conflicting re
ports of the game than had reached
here before. F. V. Brooks, '96, who
was editor of the American a paper
supported by the soldiers, only
within a few days suppressed for
some outspoken editorial, rceived a
cable that the score was 6-0 in our
favor. Next day the report of 22-0
against us came in. The boys re
fused to believe this, and up to the
time Thomas left, the 18th of last
month, papers had not arrived and
the question was still in doubt.
The soldiers have formed a library
of which Grow is librarian. As a
whole, the life is exceedingly mon
otonous and all the Stanford men
are disgusted with the army.
Thomas brought back a great
number of relics and curios.
