Above is printed a preliminary
make-up of the staff of the Daily
Palo Alto for this semester. It
will be altered from time to time
as occasion arises. Working with
the theory that a better paper can
be published by a small and earn
est staff than by a large one with
no very deep interest in the wel
fare of its publication, an effort
will be made to have only workers
on the staff. This may keep the
staff small, but it will mean more
to be one of that number. Lf there
are many who have sufficient in
terest in the college Daily to impel
them to actively help it, there will
be a large staff and the success of
the paper will be assured. Jf there
are fewer the paper must suffer cor
respondingly. The editors earn
estly solicit the co-operation of
every man and woman in the stu
dent body and faculty, and if any
can assist regularly, they will be
admitted to the ''little band of
earnest workers," with titles vary
ing according to the quality and
quantity of their assistance.
