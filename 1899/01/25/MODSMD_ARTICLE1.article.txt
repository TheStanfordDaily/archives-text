# DEATH OF CAPTAIN BECKETT.
## Complications Arising- from Appendicitis Prove Fatal at Four This Morning. 
### 
George M. Beckett, '00, died
this morning at live minutes past
three o'clock.
At the bed-side, when the end
came, were the father of the de
ceased, Dr. Wood, two nurses, and
his room-mate, C. F. Metteer, '00.
His death was due to appendicitis
and the complications which arose
from it.
One week ago yesterday morn
ing, shortly before noon, Beckett
became slightly ill while in Greek
Tragedy class. He went to lunch
at 12:30, complaining of a slight
pain, but expressing the hope that
a cup of tea would brace him up.
He returned to his room after eat
ing and soon began to suffer with a
severe stomach-ache. Hot towels
were applied, but he gained no re
lief, and at 3 o'clock Trainer Mc-
Leod was summoned, and remained
with the patient all the evening ap
plying hot towels. At 7:30 Mr. Met
teer went for Dr. Wood to get medi
cine for a stomach-ache. Beckett
took this, but continued to suffer
intensely until Wednesday when
he seemed better. He insisted on
getting up and seemed to be recov
ering. His room-mate attended
classes from 8:15 and did not re
turn until noon. Beckett soon had
to go back to bed, however, and
was suffering considerably, when
Trainer McLeod fortunately called
about 9 o'clock. McLeod imme
diately went for Dr. Wood. The
doctor suspected that the condition
might be either inflammation of
the bowels or appendicitis, al
though the symptoms were not in
all respects those of either condi
tion. Beckett began to experience
great pain at midnight, but would
not consent to have the doctor
called until 4 o'clock Thursday
morning. The pain had then be
come unbearable. Dr. Wood gave
him slight relief, but Thursday
morning his condition was so criti
cal that the doctor advised the call
ing of another physician for con
sultation. Dr. Stallard of Menlo
arrived at 9 o'clock in response to
the call, and, after examination,
insisted that it was a bad case of
constipation. He advised medicine
accordingly.
During the remainder of Thurs
day Beckett was restless, but ap
peared better in the evening; at
midnight, however, the suffering
returned, and in spite of the pro
testations of the patient, Dr. Wood
was again called and gave a seda
tive. Under the influence of this
Beckett rested quietly till 8 o'clock
Friday morning. The pain grew
so unbearable that Dr. Wood de
cided to send immediately for Dr.
Stillman, the surgical specialist of
San Francisco.
Dr. Stillman arrived at 3:49 in
the afternoon. He made a close)
examination and decided that ap
pendicitis was the trouble. Dr.
Stillman advised an operation, and,
after consulting with friends,
Beckett consented to submit. The
surgeon began work at half-past
four and finished in an hour.

After the operation the patient's
condition was fairly good, though
not satisfactory in all respects, and
a favorable outcome was hoped for.
On Monday evening some of the
symptoms became less favorable
and on Tuesday afternoon there
was a decided change for the worse.
The condition of the patient became
so critical that at 10 o'clock in the
evening Dr. Boss of liedwood was
summoned. Beckett became so
restless that powerful medicines
failed to completely control his de
lirium, from which he had not re
covered for any length of time since
the operation. At 2 o'clock he became
unconscious and from then was
kept under sedatives until the end
came.
Mr. and Mrs. Beckett left this
morning for San .Jose. The body
was taken to Redwood to be em
balmed. Tomorrow morning the
casket will be placed on the 10:20
train to be taken through to the
home at Arroyo Grande.
George Marion Beckett was
twenty-three years, live months,
and live days old. He was born on
a farm near Watsonsville. where
he tirst attended school. His family
later removed to San Jose. He grad
uated from the high school with
the class of '95.
During his high school career
Beckett was a prominent figure ;
he was president of the school
"Senate" and presided at the grad
uating exercises in 1894. He took
an active part in debating and rep
resented both his society and class
in contests, lie was president of
his class in his senior year. He
was naturally leader in the high
school athletics, playing guard on
the football team and tirst base at
baseball.
Beckett entered Stanford with
the Class of 1900. His record here
is well known to all. He played
right tackle on the victorious 1900
football team; he also made sub
tackle on the Varsity. Alt ough
he never had had much training as
a pitcher, he succeeded in making
that important position on the
Varsity baseball team in the same
year.
In his sophomore year Beckett
again filled the box for Stanford
and pitched winning ball through
out the season. His game showed
wonderful improvement over that
of his freshman year and he was
pronounced by experts the best
amateur pitcher on the Coast. At
the close of the season he was
chosen captain of this year's team.
Since his election he has taken
an unusual interest in building up
a strong team for this season.
Since entering the University
Beckett has made Law his major,
lie was an excellent student. Last
September lie joined Philolexian
Literary Society and gave fair
promise in debating. He never!
held any student body or class of
fice, but was universally recognized !
as a man of sound judgment, whose
opinions were always valued.
The deceased was exceedingly
temperate in his habits and never;
dissipated in anyway. This fact, [
together with his naturally strong I
constitution, enabled him to light!
off death so long.
