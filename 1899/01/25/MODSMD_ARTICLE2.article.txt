# MR. JAMES' LECTURE.
## He Gives a Striking Description of "The Snake Dance of the Moki." 
### 
The second illustrated lecture by
Mr. G. Wharton James was de
livered last night in the chapel to
a large audience. Mr. James, after
a few introductory remarks, re
ferred briefly to his lecture deliv
ered last Tuesday. He then began
upon last night's subject, the
" Snake Dance of the Moki In
dians."
He took the audience with him,
by means of many illustrations,
over the vast desert country that
must be passed before reaching the
mesas of the Moki peoples and
their wonderful pueblos. He gave
a detailed outline of the customs
and manners of the Moki people,
showing that the original motive of
the Pueblo Indians in building
their cities on these high and al
most inaccessible mesas was that of
protection in time of war. He
told of the great patience and
perserverence of the Mokis in
founding their cities on the mesa,
and of the futile attempts of the
government officials to have them
abandon their homes on the mesas
and come down and live in the
valley in houses that the govern
ment had built for them. After
displaying to the audience a great
number of pictures showing the
Moki at home and many of the na
tive customs, Mr. James proceeded
with an interesting description of
the "Snake Dance of the Moki."
The snake dance is an invocation
to the snake deity, a water god,
"80-ho-la-con-gua" by name, and
snakes, particularly rattlesnakes,
are used in this dance. It is a
solemn religious ceremony, cele
brated every two years.
Mr. James' views of the dancers
taken at Walpi, Oraibi, and Tewa i
show them with numbers of these
venomous reptiles in their hands.
His views of the sacred ceremony
of the "washing of the snakes in
the snake kevathe underground
chamber of the snake fraternity,
are the only ones in existence. Mr.
James and two other white men
are the only persons, outside of the
Moki race, who have ever witnessed
this ceremony.
Mr. James refutes the statement
that the Mokis are rough, brutal
barbarians and claims that they
possess a gentle, patient, harmless,
and industrious nature. The lec
ture was interesting throughout
and was delivered in a pleasant
conversational manner.
