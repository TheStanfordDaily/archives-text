# Debaters Meet.
## 
### 
Last night the Intercollegiate De
bating Committee called a meeting
of the twelve contestants who are
to appear in the finals for the In
tercollegiate debate. There was
some discussion as to the advisa
bility of debating the Intercollegi
ate question in the finals, as is the
custom at Berkeley, but it was final
ly decided not to do so.
It was also decided that our rep
resentatives on the Intercollegi
ate Committee should stand for the
system allowing any speaker on
the affirmative to make rebuttal, in
stead of confining it to the first
speaker.
