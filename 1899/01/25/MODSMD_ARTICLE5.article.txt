## 
### 
At a meeting of the board of di
rectors of the Encina Club last
evening it was deemed advisable
in view of Captain Beckett's serious
illness to postpone indefinitely the
at home arranged for Friday even
ing, for which cards had been issued
when Captain Beckett was still in
the best of health. The news of
his death this morning will, of
course, alter in no wise the decision
arrived at last evening after con
sultation with Dr. Wood. The ex
act date to which the reception will
be postponed can not be announced
as yet, but the event will take place
sometime during the semester.
At a meeting today at noon the
directors of the club passed resolu
tions of respect, which appear in
another column.
