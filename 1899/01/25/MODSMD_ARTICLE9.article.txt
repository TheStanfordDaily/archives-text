After ;i sickness, sudden, brief,
and terrible- —the more terrible be
cause of its suddenness and brevity
—George Beckett has been taken
from us. It was only a day or two
ago that we first heard that lie was
ill, and then with dreadful rapidity
have come the bulletins from the
sick-room that his condition was
serious and then critical, that an
operation must be performed under
discouraging circumstances, and
after that came the anxious hours
when hope and fear alternately
predominated, and then death came
almost as a. welcome release to the
sufferer. Beckett has been among
us, one of our heroes, and now he
is taken from us, more a hero be
cause of the patient fortitude with
which he bore the agony of the
last few days. We have heard
that be was suffering and we have
suffered with him so far as our
weak sympathies would permit; we
have lent what feeble aid we could;
and now that the tension of ner
vous suspense has been slackened
by the end, we are realizing more
than we could in the anxious hours
of waiting what we have lost in
George Beckett. We all loved the
man. W r e admired his manliness
and honesty, lie was our idol on
the diamond, the captain and
pitcher of our baseball team, who
never lost his head in the pitcher's
box. He always did his best for
his college in athletics, on the dia
mond, on the oval, and on the
gridiron. His magnificent phy
sique, his athletic prowess com
pelled our admiration and have
placed his name on the roll of our
heroes to be read and talked of by
future classes. But from the heart
of each one of us there has gone
out to him more than admiration;
we are more than merely proud of
him. We love him for himself.
Future classes will be told of how
he made the team in his freshman

year and died while lie was cap
tain, planning a victory for his
team for which he has labored with
such whole-hearted enthusiasm;
they will know of Beckett the Var
sity pitcher. Hut we have known
Beckett the man. He has been
our friend, genial, jovial, sympa
thetic, considerate; a man with the
simplicity of a noble nature. We
can not give in mere words any ex
pression of his character as we
knew him, but we who have known
his life can cherish his memoiy as
an inspiration toward his own
simple and noble type of manhood.
And because he has left this mem
ory among us, the short and in
complete life of George Beckett was
not in vain.
What can we, who have also
known and loved him—what can
we say that will make less keen
the suffering of his nearest and
dearest, and especially of the mother
who has seen her stalwart lirst
born taken away in the strength of
his youth, but that we have known
and loved him, and out of that
love has come the fullest sympathy.
