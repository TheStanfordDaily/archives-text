By the treasurer's report pub
lished in the Daily Palo Alto it is
seen that there is some $1500 more
in the treasury of the Associated
•Students now than there was at
this time last year. This is chiefly
due to the efficiency and watchful
ness of the treasurer. Wherever it
was possible without injury to any
student body interests, expenses
have been cut down considerably
from those of former years. This
was especially true in regard to the
grounds fort he Thanksgiving game,
for the erection of seats, and for
employees. The bill for printing
was also kept as low as possible.
The receipts from the Thanksgiving
game were greater than last year,
but from other football games during
the season there was derived far
less money than usual.

Freshman classes are in general
alike, their differences being in de
gree rather in kind, liut the de
gree of remissness of the Class of
1902 is appalling; not merely on
account of the class itself, hut also
on account of the student hody at
large. They called a meeting this
semester for the purpose of nomi
nating officers, and there were not
enough candidates for the honors
the class had to bestow. A meet
ing for election of what officers
could be mustered in could not
take place simply because there
were finally no officers to elect by
the time various withdrawals and
declinations had been counted up.
What are the class members going
to do to redeem themselves? This
thing is serious. It is from such
actions as have characterized this
class during the present semester
that whatever obloquy there is in
the term ' freshman" arises. There
must be enough earnest men in the
class to see that its spirit is not let
to die. There is, of course, great
credit due to those members who
have been present at the meetings
in the face of so much discourage
ment; to those no criticism is di
rected. But to those who care so lit
tle that they do not attend meet
ings and loudly proclaim their dis
gust for their fellows, doing noth
ing to avert disgrace from their or
ganization, there is the assurance
that they are fast losing the respect
of the rest of the students. It is
hoped that something will be done,
that there will be a realization
that something must he done.
What kind of university spirit will
we have if things go on as they
have been, when IUO2 comes to
take its place as a leader in college?
What hope will there be for inter
collegiate victories in the days to
come when this class will be sup
posed to be in power?
