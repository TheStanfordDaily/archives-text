# STANFORD LEGISLATION
## President Jordan Tells of the Progress of the Exemption Bill. 
### 
President Jordan returned Thurs
day morning from Sacramento,
where he went a few days ago on
business connected with the propo
sition now before the State Legisla
ture to exempt Stanford University
from taxation. President Jordan,
Professor Abbott, and George E.
Crothers, '95, ail spoke on Thurs
day night before the Senate Judici
ary Committee, to which the reso
lution for a constitutional amend
ment has been referred. It is now
intended to divide the proposed
amendment in two parts. One of
these will be an amendment to the
State constitution recognizing Stan
ford University as an institution of
public utility and releasing it from
all taxation except the county and
municipal taxes upon its farms.
The other part of the bill will be
an act correcting technicalities in
the original enabling act under
which the University was founded.
These technical points are not of
any great importance; but it is con
sidered prudent to setile them so as
to leave not the slightest doubt in
regard to them.
President Jordan speaks in praise
of the careful and painstaking work
done by Messrs. Sheehan, Crothers,
and Keesling in placing the matter
of tax exemption clearly before the
legislators at Sacramento. Nothing
now remains but for the students
to use their personal influence with
their representatives as best they
can. The Stanford delegation was
given a very friendly reception at
Sacramento, and there is much
reason to hope for action favorable
to the University at an early day.
