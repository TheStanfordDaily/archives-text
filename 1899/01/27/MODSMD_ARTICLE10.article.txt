George Marion Beckett, has been
called from life on earth; and
Whereas, With his departure we
lose a fellow-student, a friend, and
a man, respected, beloved and hon

as to know him; therefore, be it
Resolved, By the Class of 1900 of

that it is with sincere sorrow we
mourn the loss of our class-mate;
and be it further
Resolved, That we offer to the
stricken parents, sisters and brother
our deepest sympathy in their be
reavement.
