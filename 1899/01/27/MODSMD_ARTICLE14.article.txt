By the announcement of the
names of the judges, we are
reminded that the Carnot de
hate is held in our chapel
just one week from tonight. In
the selection of judges the debaters
have heen most fortunate \ll are
men of prominence though each in
different walks of life. One is a
gifted divine, the second a member
of a leading law firm of
San Francisco, the third, also
from the metropolis, a well known
and successful business man, and a
member of last year's Board of
Education. The composite opinion
of these three men will be compre
hensive, able, and fair. We will
rest satisfied with their decision.
