Again it seems necessary for us
to ask the whereabouts of the Press
Club. In past years this organiza
tion has proved to he of much benefit
to students interested in journalism,
by developing in them a mutual
fellowship and keeping them in
touch with the newspaper world.
There are many students here who
intend to follow journalism for a
livelihood as there are many who
have, previous to their matricula
tion been engaged in the work, and
anything which tends to bring them
together is fraught with benefit for
the inexperienced. Again, well
known newspaper men might be
invited to lecture before the mem
bers of the organization. There is
a place for the Press Club â€”let us
have one.
