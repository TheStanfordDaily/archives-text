If there is any one among the
members of the student body who
has not done all in his power to in
fluence his representatives in the
Legislature in favor of the tax ex
emption plan, now is the time to
act. Jt is not to he expected that
each letter will sway a vote, nor
that what little influence we can

bring to bear will finiilly decide tbe
fate of the bill. We are making an
effort to do something, and every
ounce that can be brought to bear
in any way should be applied. Re
sponsibility of this kind should not
be shifted nor shirked. Each one
should consider hi nself personally
responsible to see that whatever lies
within his power to do, is done. We
must not lose by lack of effort a
struggle which means so much to
us.
