McCutcheon & Eells, and Mr. San
derlynn Snow, formerly a member

entertainment while at the Univer
sity will be arranged for by Pro
fessor Lathrop.
The Berkeley team will be cared
for by President Whittaker, '99, of
the lntersociety Debating League.
They will have the afternoon before
the debate to themselves, and it is
desired that nothing be done for
their entertainment unless they so
wish.
