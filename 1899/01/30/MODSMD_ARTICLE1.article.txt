# MEMORIAL SERVICES.
## Impressive Tributes to Dr. Thoburn's Worth Which Were Given in the Chapel Yesterday. 
### 
The memorial service to Profes
sor Thoburn in the chapel yester
day was exceptionally beautiful
and impressive.
The chapel, decorated with palm
branches mingled with flowers and
bamboo, was completely filled.
After the organ voluntary, Pro
fessor Show read from the Scrip
tures and Mrs. Ross of Portland,
Oregon, sang a solo, " Thy Will be
Done." At the close of the ser
vice Dr. Little sang very effec
tively Tennyson's "Crossing the
Bar," set to music by Dudley
Buck.
Dr. Elliott told of his acquaint
ance with Professor Thoburn be
ginning when Thoburn first came
here as a student and deepening
and widening as the years went on.
He spoke of Dr. Thohurn's unmis
takable leadership and of the
strength, modesty, and consistency
of his life.
" Some men," he said, ''have re
ligious sides. He was a true child
of God; his life was of one piece.
Some men have the gift of tongues.
What he said came straight out of
a deep personal experience. Re
ligion was to him not intellectual
formation of any kind. He worked
with many who having put away
the apparatus of religious expres
sion had assumed that they had
thereby put aside their religion.
He insisted on counting men where
they belonged, and so sharing to
them the heritage of the kingdom
of God. And so he was optimistic,
hopeful of the religious life here
among us.
"The University made him a
part of itself because it could not
help it. The University needed
-not particularly his scholarship,
not particularly the filling of any
gaps in its schedule of courses—it
needed his manhood, his life-giving
quality, his inspiration, his life. It
gave his chair differing names; he
used to smile at their variety. But
there never was any doubt as to
the use to be made of him."
Professor Whittier spoke as fine
of Dr. Thohurn's old students; li
kening his life to thatofagreat oak
that offered rest and shade to the
people of a busy town.
Professor Murray read some
stanzas of poetry appropriate to the
occasion and, after a violin solo by
Mr. Du 1 ley, Mr. Hutchinson of Palo
Alto, spoke briefly of Dr. Thoburn
as he had known him in the May-
Meld church and in Palo Alto as a
public spirited citizen. He also
read some extracts from an address
by Di. Thoburn before the Chit
Chat Club of San Francisco last
fall.
Many may wish to preserve Dr.
Jordan's tribute, and so it is
printed in full. He was so affected
that he could not finish his ad
dress and the latter part was read
by Professor Murray.
Once when a wise and good man
died these words were said of him:
"In whatever part of God's king
dom he may find himself, he will
be a hopeful man, looking upward
and not down ward, looking forward
and not backward, ever ready to

lend a helping hand and not afraid
to die." In words like these we
may express the moving spirit of
Thohurn's life. The problems of
existence he met simply and seri
ously, trusting that all truth is
God's truth and all living beings
are (jiod's creatures, to he studied
and helped, to be studied in order
that they may be wisely helped.
To study is the function of science.
To help is the mission of religion,
and in wisdom and helpfulness
lies their true reconciliation.
Thohurn's great intellectual vir
tue was his open mindedness. He
feared nothing which was true,
lie cherished nothing which was
false. He had learned the difficult
lesson that while truth is as broad
as the universe, which no mind can
span, the line of righteous conduct
is as narrow as a footpath com
passed by the stride of the child.
In these days knowledge accumu
lates as never before in all the ages
because men have learned to work
together in their search for wisdom.
Much that was once wisdom is now
superstition. Much that our fathers
cherished we cast on the rubbish
heap. Much of the lore of the an
cients is but old wives' tales. The
narrow creeds which once held re
ligion are too cramped for the new
wine of today. The life has gone
out of the old ceremonies. The old
rewards cease to incite to goodness;
the old punishments no longer
deter from sin. We climb higher
each day on the mountain of knowl
edge and we look on life in broader
and broader perspective. The prob
lem of living truth seems to grow
difficult. So many new paths open
before us, we know not which it is
right to choose, and many have
come to doubt whether there be
any right path of action.
With all this breadth of knowl
edge there is no change in man's
duty. To do the best lie can mo
ment by moment, day by day, is
just as insistent as it ever was.
Righteousness is not out of date,
nor is piety obsolete. The moral
law is just as strenuous today as
when the stern Hebrew prophets
knew of nothing else in the uni
verse. Though creeds lose their
validity and ceremonies fade away,
the essence of religion can not
change.
''Still stands thine ancient sacrifice,
A humble and a contrite heart."
The art of receiving new truth
with the same simple reverent
thankfulness with which he held
the oldest truth was one of which
Dr. Thoburn was master. He was
broad-minded without laxity, tol
erant without indifference, free
without irreverence. He rejoiced
in the winds of freedom, but no
part of his religion was blown
away by freedom's wayward
breezes.
Greater than his intellectual
work, greater than his influence as
a teacher was the inspiration of his
personal life. His own sermons he
lived and this in simple uncon
sciousness, "as the sun gives light
or the flower fragrance." "As the
flowers of today are the embodi
ment of past sunshine," —this was
one of his sayings—"so is the vir
tue and the happiness of today the

fruit of the love and altruism of
the past." To live again in the
virtue and happiness of his stud
ents was his greatest ambition as a
teacher. And the students knew
that they had no wiser adviser, no
better friend.
From a letter just received from
one of them, 1 take these words:
"Dr. Thoburn was the religious
force of our University. The great
est of all truths was his to show —
man's strength in God. Though
frail of body, he used faithfully the
strength he had, and the little be
came mighty to serve men. His
education was scientific; his exper
ience was deeply human. Because
he knew both science and man he
could work effectively in an atmos
phere of science to reach the heart
of men. In our Stanford nook he
was our builder, helping us under
God's laws to frame solidly hous
ing for ourselves. Science cuts life
into facts, and it is our need at
Stanford that we should put these
together, lest all we takeaway with
us but a bundle of facts.
"There is danger that Science
shall sit in her chair with her cold
comment: 'Such is the necessary
process of things; let all things
take their course.' Love flies to
the rescue and stops the bleeding
wounds of humanity, by methods
science has revealed. Faith, Hope,
and Love drive knowledge into
action. To make science a living
force for good was Dr. Thohurn's
mission. Under such influences
Stanford will send out reformers,
priests, and poets: zealous men
with warm hearts and trained
minds to save their kind from re
peating the sins of yesterday.
Souls starving on the dry husks of
theology need to be fed with truth
fresh-seen in the light of this age of
science, fresh born from the experi
ence of today."
It was Dr Thohurn's lesson that
men should not believe less, but
more. Fewer formulated state
ments, fewer dogmas it may be,
but more deeply, more intensely,
more broadly to believe, and to
carry all belief over into action.
The place which Dr. Thoburn
held in the University was one
which made itself. He did not ask
to be called as Professor of human
life, nor did the authorities go out
to seek him as such.
He entered the University in
1891 as a graduate student with
the rest of the pioneers. When
we knew his scholarship we made
him assistant in Zoology, and from
this minor work his own character
called him onward. His thoughts
and influence were bounded by no
chair, and it was not long before
his studies broadened to the com
pass of human life. In a playful
way bis colleagues spoke of him as
their " spiritual adviser," but be
hind this jest was perfect serious
ness.
He was our spiritual guide, the
most esteemed adviser, the best
beloved friend, the one whose loy
alty to friendship, whose loyalty to
the University, whose loyalty to
Christianity, to righteousness and
truth was never questioned.
In adding my word today, I
have not wished to speak of my
self. But I cannot refrain from

one expression. There is no one
who owes Dr. Thoburn a greater
debt than I, though L was not the
first to realize it or to acknowledge
it. In the old garden of the Fran
ciscans in a far-away city, I re
ceived the sad and tender message
from Dr. Gilbert: "Our dear friend
Thoburn is dead." 1 was over
whelmed with inexpressible sadness
and a feeling almost of discourage
ment. He was one the University
could not spare. All at once
the warmth went out from the
tropical sunshine. The shad
ows fell on the white mountain
tops. The delightful tour in the
quaint cities around the tall vol
canoes, which Dr. Thoburn him
self, who knew and loved Mexico,
had helped us to plan, seemed to
lose its charm. Each of us had
lost —from the life of this world —
a dear friend. But we all felt more
than this. Our beloved University
had lost its strongest, its most vital
influence for good.
"The gap in our picked and chosen,
The long years may not fill."
The place he made is one that
must be forever vacant. Other
wise and good and Christian men
will come and go. Other men will
lecture on the unity of life and
the soundness of God's universe;
but there can be but one Thoburn
and his place in the University
must be his alone.
And now we may say again: "In
whatever part of God's kingdom
he may find himself he will be
a hopeful man looking upward and
not downward, looking forward
and not backward, ever ready to
lend a helping hand and not
afraid to die."
