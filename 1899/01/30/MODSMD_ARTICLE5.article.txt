Professor Thoburn once sug
gested a volume of Stanford ser
nons. This would seem a most
excellent idea, and, as was men
tioned yesterday, no such volume
could be more appropriately begun
than with a collection of Professor
Thoburn's "Stanford sermons." We
hope that some move in this direc
tion will be made.
