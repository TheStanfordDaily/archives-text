new method for the control of the

tution. It is likely that a plan,
suggested by President Ashley, will
be worked out, which provides for
about $1,800 per year. This sum
is to cover gymnasium work as well
as outdoor sports. It is expected
that about one third of this amount
can be appropriated by the trus

fifty cents per term can be added to
the regular incidental fees of all

probable that some Eastern man
can be secured as coach for both
baseball and football. All students
will be admitted free to games.
