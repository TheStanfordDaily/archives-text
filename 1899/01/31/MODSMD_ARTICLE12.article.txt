The meeting of the chess men to
morrow evening should not be
slighted by those who play the
game. We have agreed to play an
annual match with Berkeley, but so
far this year have made no prepara
tion for it. We can not afford to
wait until the last moment before
awakening to a realization of the
fact that we should have been do
ing something. Now is the time
for our chess men to get under head
way and inaugurate a series of pre
liminary games. The plan should
not fail through lack of interest.
