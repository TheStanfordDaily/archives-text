## 
### 
President Giiman was recently
a√üked what couWl he done at Johns
Hopkins University with the gift
of a million dollars. In reply he
said: Undoubtedly the best use of
such a fund would he to invest it
and employ the income only for
the promotion of the manifold de
partments of the university at the
discretion of the trustees; hut if
more specific intimations are de
sired, J would say that the founda
tion of ten professorships each with
a capital of $100,000 would he most
serviceable. Hut as many could
give smaller sums than that, J
name among the wants of the uni
versity the following:
1. A generous endowment of the
library of any amount.
2. Aid for deserving students.
3. An athletic field, where all
athletic sports might be encouraged.
