A. G. Muddren, ex-'OO, who was
curator in the University Museum
last semester, lias gone to the Caro
line Islands for the purpose of col
lecting natural history specimens.
He took passage on a schooner
which touches at the islands twice
a year, and will return some time
in May. Mr. Maddren is well known
at the University as an earnest
scientist and as an indefatigable
and conscientious collector. The
trip is taken on his own responsi
bility, yet the zoological museum
will no doubt profit by his collec
tions The Carolines form a group
comprising about 560 square miles,
with 36,000 inhabitants, and are
situated in the North Pacific east of
the Philippines.
