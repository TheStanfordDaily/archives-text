# Bill for Regulating- Charities.
## 
### 
A bill "for establishing a State
Advisory Board of Charities and
Corrections" has passed its first
reading in the California Legisla
ture and is now in the hands of the
House Committee on Commissions
and Public Expenditures.
The provisions of the act follow
the models of those in successful
operation in all the systematized
charities of States farther east. The
board shall consist of three mem
bers, to serve without compensa
tion. These members will have
full power to study the public char
ities and the systems of dealing
with criminals throughout the
State. To insure thorough knowl
edge for these duties the board will
have full liberty to summon any
public ofliciiil and to examine any
report or account of any institu
tion. In addition to this super
vision of systems already in opera
tion the board will establish co
operation between different locali
ties. There will be gained the
understanding that there is a well
defined center for all methods of
public charities and reforms, from
the administration of penitentiaries
to that of orphan asylums.
The Board, while having un
limited power for investigation,
will have no executive power. Their
work will be through the various
State committees at the heads of
the different departments. The
value of the Board will be in its
power of complete knowledge of
conditions, putting this knowledge
in the hands of exactly the ones
that should have it. In this wiiy
there is attained, beyond co-opera
tion and efficiency of the State
agents, a wider and more intelli
gent system, something concrete in
its workings and with centered
data.
Through the Board will be gained
a siifer public sentiment, a reliance
on economical administration, and
the assurance of an efficient corps
of officials.

The bill is the outcome of the
efforts of several of the men and
women most prominent in charity
work in the State as well as of Pro
fessor Frank A. Fetter. The latter
recently addressed a meeting in
San Francisco on the subject, after
which he drew up the circular
which is being distributed. In ad
dition, several students at the Uni
versity are hoping to finish the
work by correspondence with per
sonal friends who have influence.
