It seems too bad that it should
be necessary to warn students more
than once not to deliberately injure
the baseball field. Yet such is the
case. The diamond was recently
smoothed off and prepared for prac
tice. Since the rain, however,
enough people have traversed both
the infield and outfield on wheels
and afoot, so that all the work
must be done over again. What is
most disagreeable about the whole
thing is that the injury has been
done largely by men who are
supposed to have the interests of
college athletics most nearly at
heart.
