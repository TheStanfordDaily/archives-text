With the opening of the present
athletic season it seems well to say
just a word to the men who are
going into training for baseball,
track, or tennis, to let them know
that a majority of the students keep
informed on what the athletes are
doing throughout the training sea
son, and that they will classify a
man by his work. Every man who
attempts any sport should enter
into it only after he has considered
what he has to give up and what he
is going to gain by strictly and con
scientiously living uj) to the training
rules prescribed by the captain or
trainer; he must know that in any
branch of athletics sacrifices must
be made and are expected, and he
should so arrange his studies or
affairs that he will be able to make
them. These sacrifices are not
without compensation, but the com
pensation sometimes may seem in
adequate. It is not, if athletics are
rightly taken. Sometimes the best

athletes are the best students, but
on the other hand an athlete
may let athletics become so unduly
prominent that he ceases to be a
student. However, every able
bodied man in college should go
into athletics for his own good and
for the good of the college. And
once in, let a man carry it out in
proper shape, doing his very best,
letting nothing that he can prevent
interfere with his training.
