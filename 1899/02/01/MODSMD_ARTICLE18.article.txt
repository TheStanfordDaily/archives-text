E. M. Ehrhorn, who pursued
special work at the University in
1891 and 1892, yesterday brought
Dr. Branner some fossils of the Plio
cene period, which he discovered
in digging a well on his ranch
near Mountain View. The shells
were discovered in.a place about
thirty-seven feet below the surface.
Two hundred and seventeen feet
down the augur ran through a red
wood stump. The wood, though
somewhat decayed on the outside,
retained on the inside much the
same state as when deposited in its
present position. These stumps
have been found in many places
over the valley and at varying
depths, from the lowlands by the
bay to the city of Santa Clara. A
tree was found over HOO feet below
the surface in digging a well near
the old hotel at Mountain View
some years ago. The theory is that
Santa Clara valley, or part of it,
was once an inland lake, the bot
tom gradually sinking, the trees
coming down in landslides from
the hills and then being covered up
in the course of many years.
