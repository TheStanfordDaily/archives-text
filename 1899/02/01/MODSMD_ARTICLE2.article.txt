At the coming Carnot debate,
which will take place in the chapel
at 8 p.m. next Friday evening, ap
proximately one third of the seats
will be reserved until 7:45 for
Berkeley students and members of
the Stanford faculty. Access to the
reserved portion will be through the
door nearest the platform. The
other door will be for entry to the
unreserved section, and the Stan
ford students will facilitate mat
ters by appearing at that door.
Places for reporters will be pro
vided. No more definite statement
concerning the number of Berkeley

that it will probably be large.
