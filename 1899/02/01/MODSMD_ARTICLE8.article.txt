# THE 						GREEK DRAMA.
## A 						Summary of Greek Tragedy and a Comparison with Modern Drama. 
### 
The lecture last evening by Pro
fessor Murray, on the Greek Drama,
gave a clear general view of the
subject. The mists of an ancient
history and a chaotic mythology,
the labyrinths of technicality, were
trimmed away to leave a definite,
pleasing conception of early dram
atic art.
Beginning with the beginnings,
Pr >fessor Murray gave the origin
of tragedy in the early songs of the
goat-clad worshippers of Dionysus,
the god of animal, joyous living;
and his symbols, the vine, the vint
age, and the "honey-hearted" wine.
Then with the broadening of time
came the wider knowledge and the
fuller art; with the stress of govern
ment and the mettle of war, came
the grander courage of pathos and
of strength. Then came the three
great men of ancient drama: Eschy
lus, the dramatist of destinies;
Sophocles, studying the power of
the will of man; Euripides, working
through all the passions of living.
The dramas were high and pure,
dealing with the gods and the vast
ness of implacable destinies, teach
ing the truth of Greek religion,
''The gods forget not and sinners
suffer."
In the study of the Greek forms,
Professor Murray brought out in
particular two points that are
marked differences in contrast with
the English modern drama. The
first and most marked is, of course,
the three "unities." Yet even here
the popular mind is mistaken in
its understanding, and the French
following errs from its model. The
continual presence of the chorus on
the stage limited, it is true, wide
liberty in changing the drama from
the unities of time, of place, and of
action. Yet the dramatists were
not completely trammelled; for
often they swung aside from the
simple logic of the unities, and
moved their actors as their art dic
tated.
The other point was the Greek
use of the psychologic law, the
power of simple suggestion. The
modern drama leaves little to the
imagination; passions or coarse
nesses, delicate movement or hid
eously-detailed crime, pass upon
our stage and produce their effect
in a metallic glare, unrelieved, and
with no lines hidden. The Greeks
produced their effect of tragedy;
yet in a murder, there was not seen
the hand that struck the blow. The
tragedy was felt by the audience
through the woe of the mourners
and the revenge that came through
destiny upon the murderer.
''In Orestes, we are spared the bor
row of the spectacle of matricide.
The scene opens and discloses him
sword in hand over the dead bodies
of his mother and her paramour.
He tells of his mother's fearful
guilt. He can not glory in his
triumph. He can not boast of his
vengeance. He is a matricide. And
even as he speaks, he feels madness
upon him; the hell-hounds of a
mother's curse are let loose; in ter
ror he sees advancing upon him
the Erinys, creatures of remorse, in
their sable robes and their flowing,

snakey locks." That is tragedy, as
the Greek dramatists produced it.
The lecture as a whole left upon
the mind an easy-sitting knowl
edge of a swift passage over the art,
giving agreeably to the general stu
dent the general view and broaden
ing the conception of that Greek
genius "to which we owe, not the
instinct for beauty alone, but, even
above that, the instinct for truth."
