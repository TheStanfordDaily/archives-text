# THE
						CARNOT.
## Lots Drawn for Positions This Afternoon.â€” The Debaters on Both Sides. 
### 
The University of California
held a student body meeting today
and discussed the matter of a spe
cial train to come to the debate to
morrow. President Thomas of the
Associated Students of the Univer
sity of California was in conference
with President Schwartz over the
telephone concerning the matter,
and President Schwartz strongly
advised them to engage a train
that should make the campus its
terminus.
The Reception Committee has ar
ranged for buses to meet all after
noon trains tomorrow. Sub-com
mittees have been appointed at
lloble and Enema to care for the
comfort of visitors.
The positions of the speakers in
the Carnot debate were announced
this afternoon. They are as fol
lows: Affirmative, Springer, Mar
tin, Suzzallo; negative, Cloud,
Hayden, and Warren. This draw
ing is, on the whole, very satisfac
tory to the Stanford debaters.
The men have their arguments
all pretty thoroughly prepared and
have twenty-four hours now in
which to establish themselves in
the positions which have fallen to
them and put the finishing touches
on their speeches.
