In view of the efforts of the '99
Finance Committee to gather the
musical clubs together for a Train
ing-House concert, the present in
action of several of the clubs is
most deplorable. Each organiza
tion quiets its conscience with a
different excuse. Some are waiting
for plans concerning the distant
future to mature. Others think it
too early in the semester to have
accomplished much in the way of
rehearsal. The Ladies' Glee has
already settled down to earnest
work. The other clubs have not
been heard of so far except to voice
good intentions, and we all know
that good intentions will put no
organization in shape for a public
appearance. We are sorry to hear
that the Ladies' Mandolin Club, in
talking of disbanding, confess to a
lack of even the latter. What is
the use of encouraging musical
societies at Stanford if they will
not take steps to hold themselves
available for campus calls when
the need for their help arises?
