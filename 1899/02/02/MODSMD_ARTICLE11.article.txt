# The
						Next "Sequoia."
## 
### 
This week's Sequoia will contain
as main features two rather ambi
tious stories that take up most of
the issue. " One of the Stanford
Men," by M. Madden, has a unique
plot and is very cleverly told. The
other is ''The Story of a Volun
teer," by George L. Rees, ex-'OO,
who has woven around a central
character actual experiences in
Manila during the war with Spain,
making a most dramatic story.
Leslie Harrison's notes on "Kip
ling and College Journalism," will
be concluded in this issue.
