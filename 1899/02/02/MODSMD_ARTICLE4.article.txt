# DEPARTMEMTS CONSOLIDATED.
## Zoology, Entomology, and Bionomics Hereafter to Form Department of Zoology. 
### 
One of the important changes in
our University's organization re
cently announced by President Jor
dan is the consolidation of the de
partments of Zoology, Bionomics,
and Entomology into one depart
ment of Zoology. This move was
recently determined, and the new
arrangement will appear in the
next University Register. The death
of Dr. Thoburn made some reorgan
ization of the department of Bio
nomics necessary, and as that de
partment was only separated from
the department of Zoology because
of Dr. Thoburn's work in that line,
President Jordan thinks best to
now make it again part of the
Zoology department. And as Pro
fessor Kellogg is to assist President
Jordan in his classes in Organic
Life and Social Evolution, and will
in that way unite to some extent
his own department of Entomology
with the work in Bionomics, it
seems best to make the three de
partments one.
This consolidation will not in
any way affect the courses in the
three departments, the only
change—the dropping of the courses
on Religion and the Life and
Teachings of Christ —being due to
the loss of Dr. Thoburn.
