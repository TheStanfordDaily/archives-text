# Snyder's Collecting Trip.
## 
### 
Mr. J. O. Synder, assistant in the
Zoology department, returned yes
terday from an extensive collecting
trip throughout Mexico. Mr. Sny
der's first stop was at Guadalajara,
where he made a good collection in
the neighboring rivers and in Lake
Chapala, one of the largest fresh
water lakes in Mexico. The next
stop was at the City of Mexico,
where a good collection was made
from the markets and surrounding
lakes.
From there Mr. Snyder went to
Puerte del Ixtla and succeeded in
getting several new specimens of
fish and several interesting reptiles.
Tampico was visited next and an
extensive trip through the gulf and
Panuco River was made, which
added considerably to the collec
tion. A number of small and very
interesting birds were collected
which will add greatly to the Uni
versity collection.
On the return trip two stops were
made at Rascon and Aguas Cal
ientes with very satisfactory re
sults. Mr. Snyder experienced very
little trouble as the Wells Fargo
Company were always ready to do
him any service. There was a
little trouble in getting the boxes
of packing materials across the
line as the Mexicans insisted on
being paid a duty on the old nets
and the excelsior in which the bot
tles were packed.
The expedition will probably re
sult in the discovery and identifi
cation of six or eight species of fish
and Mr. Snyder is highly satisfied,
although he has not had sufficient
time as yet to study his specimens.
