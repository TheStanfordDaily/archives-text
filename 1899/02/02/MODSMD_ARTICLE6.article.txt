# Baseball Notes.

### 
The baseball men met today at
1:30 in room 10 quad with Man
ager Lanagan in the chair. The

following were present: Swindells,
Lougheed, Edwards, Young, Chand
ler, Lanagan, Strohn. The meet
ing was called for the purpose of
electing a captain,the position being
made vacant by the death of Beck
ett. Strohn nominated Lougheed,
who was declared unanimously
elected.
H. E. Lougheed was chosen for
the same position last season, upon
the resignation of Jeffs, and it was
largely due to his earnest and un
tiring efforts, together with his ex
cellent personal work on the dia
mond, that Stanford was enabled
to win the intercollegiate series.
Manager Lanagan today an
nounced the following schedule of
games with Santa Clara: March 11,
Santa Clara; March 16, campus;
March 25, campus; March 30, Santa
Clara. In the event of a tie a fifth
game will be played.
It is not known as yet whether
the game scheduled for Saturday
with the Fireman's Fund team will
be played. Should the weather con
tinue clear it is highly probable
that the diamond will be in condi
tion, and in that event the game
will take place.
