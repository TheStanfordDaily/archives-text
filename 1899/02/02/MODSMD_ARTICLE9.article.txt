Tomoruow night in our chapel
occurs the first intercollegiate con
test of this semester. The students
of the University of California in
their papers profess to have great
confidence in the ability of their
debaters, but it is noticeable that
they base their confidence more
upon ''an unbroken line of past vic
tories" than upon the strength of
their team this year. As for us,
we have a trio of able men who
have worked faithfully to make
themselves into a team strong
enough to break the "long and un
broken line." They are the best
men we have; they have prepared
themselves faithfully and we ex
pect a victory â€”and our expecta
tion is based upon the team that
represents us this year.
