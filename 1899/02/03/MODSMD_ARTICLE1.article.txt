# TRACK MATTERS.
## Our Team Weakened by Loss of Old Point Winners, but Many New Candidates. 
### 
Work on the track has been in
progress quietly ever since the be
ginning of the semester. A good
many men were out regularly last
semester and so are in good shape
now for the heavier spring training
that will begin soon.
At the beginning of the year
prospects for a Stanford victory in
the annual field-day with the Uni
versity of California seemed
brighter than they ever were be
fore, but since then we have come
to see that Berkeley will have a
stronger team than was at first
supposed and our own team has
been severely crippled by the loss
of some of the most valuable men,
whose places it will be almost im
possible to fill.
Stanford is particularly weak
this year in the weights. Lew.
Freeman was practically the only
eligible man who had had any
previous training. By his depart
ure for the gold tields of Alaska
the weights team is left with only
untried men, some of whom are
likely to develop into point win
ners, but who as yet know almost
nothing about handling the shot
or hammer. Gilman, Cairns, and
one or two others have all the
qualifications necessary for good
performers in these events and
may, with Fickert's coaching, be
come as good weights men as Stan
ford ever sent out, even in the
sliort time they have in which to
learn. Later in the season, when
they have mastered the elements of
their events, it is probable that
Tom Carrol will come down, as he
has for several years now, to teach
them the finer points. Up to that
time Fickert is willing to give all
new men whatever assistance lies
in his power.
By Ed. Morgan's leaving college
we are rendered weak in the hurdles,
where we were strongest. Morgan
is preeminently the best hurdler on
the Coast, lie would undoubtedly
have won both these events and
would have shown up well in other
events. It seems probable that with
Morgan gone Bakewell of Berkeley
may win the hurdles, so that it
may be computed that Morgan's
absence from the team means a dif
ference of at least twenty points in
ihe total score of the field-day.
'Dick" Culver is probably the
strongest hurdler that Stanford has
left, although it is a problem where
Culver can be used to best advan
tage in the make-up of the team as
he is also a good broad-jumper and
pole-vaulter, but can not of course
compete in all these events. Dole
may be able to do some hurdling,
but it is doubtful. At present the
foot hurt in football playing is
keeping him,off the track. Strout
and Symonds are both trying the
hurdles and from present indica
tions may be taken from their
former events to (ill the gap here.
In the jumps Boyd is the most
prominent candidate, although the
ankle injured by him in training
last year is bothering him some
what now. Hopper will try for the
broad jump again with a greater
chance of developing than ever be

fore. Murphy, a freshman, has
good records in the high jump and
pole vault.
In the sprints we have lost Brun
ton and U. C. has lost Drum.
Berkeley has gained Dickson and
we have Brail, who have about the
same records. However, Dickson's
records have been made on the
Coast and Brail's in the Middle
West. It remains to be seen what
effect the California climate will
have on Brail. Birteh, with a sys
tem of training prescribed for him
by Luther Carey based upon his
individual needs, may show up
better than he did last year. Stew
art, who showed up so well as a
freshman at the Reno meet, is de
veloping and bids fair to be fast.
There are a number of new men
of unproven ability whose work is
encouraging.
The 440 yard dash was run for
us last year by Karsted and Dig
gles. Karsted has left college and
Diggles has got a lot of extra weight
to work off before he will be fast
again. Chadbourne, an inexperi
enced man, will probably be put
into this event and one other, either
the 220 yards dash or the half
mile. Clinton, the Varsity half
back, has enough speed for the
quarter-mile if he can train down
to the weight and endurance. 1 vice,
the Freshman football captain,
showed the necessary speed and en
durance on the gridiron, but has
been prevented by sickness from
consistent practice this semester.
The distance runs will be taken
care of by Captain Smith, Williams,
Arnold, Bauer, Morris, and others
who are developing now. As usual
there is a good-sized squad of can
didates for these runs, many of
whom are 'sure to become strong
men at these distances before they
leave college, while others are put
to work at other events. The dis
tance team is weakened by the loss
of Strout, who seemed likely to
prove a fast half-mile man this
year, but who is now working at
the hurdles.
Lousley and Wright are the only
men with experience in walking,
but there are several new men who
are walking well for the time of
year.
The bicycle race is too doubtful
to admit of prophecy. Halm and
Murphy will ride again this year
and there is a good squad of new
men. Indications seem to point to
Berkeley's superiority here.
Manager Culver made a n attempt
to remedy the superabundance of
cinders on the track by putting a
layer of clay on. However, the
rain changed the clay into mud be
fore it was properly worked into
the track so that the track will not
be in good condition again until
after there have been a few dry
warm days. He is having new
hurdles constructed and has ordered
new poles for vaulting and has
furnished another shot and hammer.
Next Monday afternoon the first
of a series of preliminary try-outs
has been announced. This will be
for a mile. A week after that will
come the half-mile; then the quar
ter, and so on. These try-outs are
more for the benefit of candidates
in learning "form" than to pick
men for the team.
