We publish today a challenge to
the Sequoia staff for a game of base
ball. The exact date, price of ad
mission, and style of weapons per
missible to be thrown at the um
pire, have purposely been left for
final arrangement by a board of
arbitration, in case the challenge is
accepted. The proceeds of the
game —after deductions are made for
hospital bills and libel suits —can
be turned over to the Training
house Fund or to the treasury of
the Press Club. This challenge is
given in good faith and we mean
business. Come on, you Sequoia!
