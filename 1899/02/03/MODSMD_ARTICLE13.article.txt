One of the greatest needs of our
University at present is that of a
h >spital on the campus. For some
years the Students' Guild has been
working toward this end, but is
sti 11 far from having sufficient
funds for the accomplishment of its
aim. The disadvantages of caring
for students who become suddenly
ill were forcibly demonstrated in
the case of Captain Beckett. There
was no place where he could be
taken for proper treatment, and he
could only be given such comforts
as were quickly improvised in
noisy Encina. Neither dormitories
nor boarding houses offer suitable
surroundings in which to nurse
sick persons, while a hospital would
afford all necessary conveniences
at a minimum of cost. In case of
the outbreak of any contagious
disease, the value of such a build

ing would be incalculable. The
students owe it to themselves and
to those who send them here to
make every possible provision
against sickness and accident.
There have been many instances
where students were taken to the
homes of professors for treatment;
this is an imposition upon the fac
ulty households, as well as a dis
advantage to the patients.
With this necessity brought out so
clearly of late, it might be well for
the Students' Guild to prosecute
this enterprise vigorously. No
doubt both students and faculty
will be glad to do all in their power
to assist in the founding of such an
institution.
