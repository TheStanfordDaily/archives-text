# A 						"Stevenson Tea."
## 
### 
The "Shakspere Tea" which the
Woman's Club of Palo Alto recently
gave for the benefit of the Palo Alto
Free Public Library proved such a
success that they are going to give
a "Stevenson Tea" near the end
of the month for the same purpose.
It will take place at the house of
Mrs. Branner on the afternoon of
February 25.
The program will consist of read
ings by Mrs. Jordan, music by the
Stanford Girls' Glee, and solos from
Stevenson's songs.
Mrs. G. 11. Wright of Palo Alto
and Miss Griffin of San Francisco
have charge of the music.
The admission will be ten cents.
