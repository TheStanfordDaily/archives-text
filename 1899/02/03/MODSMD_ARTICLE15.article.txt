Professor Barnes' letter gives an
interesting account of his meeting
with Professor and Mrs. Ross, who
were enjoying themselves on the
continent, though Dr. Ross had not
yet regained his former health.
Next summer Professor Barnes
will deliver a course of lectures in
the Oxford Summer School and
give other lectures in various parts
of England. After returning to the
United States he will spend two
years in Eastern universities work
ing up material for his book on
" Child Study." There is yet wo) k
to be done on the "History of Edu
cation," the date of the completion
of which he can not give.
Professor and Mrs. Powers con
template a trip to Egypt later in
the season. They will probably be
accompanied by their Stanford
friends, Mr. and Mrs. G. Wood
ward.
