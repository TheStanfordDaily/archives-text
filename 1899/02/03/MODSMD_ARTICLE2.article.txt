# GAME TOMORROW.
## Weather Permitting, First Varsity Game Tomorrow.â€”Other Baseball News. 
### 
Unless it rains again before to
morrow afternoon, the first practice
baseball game of the season will be
called at 2:30 p.m. on the campus.
The Varsity will cross bats with
the Fireman's Fund team of San
Francisco, one of the best in the
city.
11. 10. Lougheed has again as
sumed the captaincy of the Stan
ford nine, and regular practice is
to commence immediately. Thus
far there have not been enough
candidates for positions on the
Varsity. The greatest number yet
out for practice has been seventeen.
In an interview this afternoon
Captain Lougheed said: "It is
highly important that more men
come out on the field. There are
not enough yet to form a first and
second nine, and unless a different
resolve is taken by many of the old
players, we shall be losing most
valuable .time. Last year there
were, at various limes, about forty
men out, as compared with a pos
sible twenty-five this year.
We are very fortunate this year
in having plenty of promising
freshman material, and these men
appear willing to do good conscien
tious work. Among the freshman
candidates are Wright, Kahn, Car
son, Sherer, Cressey, (.Teissier, and
Levy.
There is ample opportunity for
good men; for out of the last year's
nine, but five have returned to try
for their old places. The positions
that must be tilled by new men
are pitcher, third base, second base,
and center field. We must have
material from which to choose, and
1 want every man who knows the
game to come out and try for a
place."
