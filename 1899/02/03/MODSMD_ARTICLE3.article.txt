To the Editor: —The action of
certain members of the student
body in crossing the baseball field
after the rain is something which
every person in the University
ought to condemn and despise.
Time and again we have been
warned through the columns of the
Daily Balo Alto against thus
marring the baseball field, and yet
there are some among us who per
sist in ruining the field for the pur
pose of saving themselves a few
steps.
The prime requisite for a first
class baseball team is a good fast
field for daily practice. Unless
everyone keeps off the grounds we
can not secure this condition.
