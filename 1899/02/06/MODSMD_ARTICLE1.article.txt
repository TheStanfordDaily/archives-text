# CARNOT DEBATE LOST.
## Carl M. Warner Carries the Trophy to California for the Fourth Consecutive Time. 
### 
For the fourth consecutive year
a U. C. man won the Carnot medal
last Friday night. Carl M. Warner,
'99, was unanimously awarded
the medal after a brief conference
of the judges. Warner was evi
dently well posted on all phases of
the question under consideration
and thoroughly convinced of the
justice of his position. He did not
apparently suffer to any degree
from nervousness hut spoke easily
and in a conversational manner,
more as if instructing his hearers
than making a speech to win
a debate. His gestures were very
few hut rather effective at times
and his whole delivery exactly the
reverse of oratorical.
The chapel was filled Jong before
the time set for the debate and the
time was occupied by the two col
lege forces in good-humored joshing.
Berkeley had a crowd of one hun
dred and lifty down, most of whom
went back tin a special train.
At 8 o'clock Dr. Branner, the
chairman of the evening, called the
meeting to order announcing the
conditions of the contest and stat
ing the question: "Resolved, That
it is for the interest of France to
form a close alliance with Italy."
Springer, the first man of the
affirmative, argued that France
needed the alliance, that it would
be harmonious and stable, that it
would give her the dominance in
the control of Europe and a strong
ally in Africa, and that it would
benefit her commercially, while she
could not lose by it. Jn his rebut
tal, Springer was strong, introduc
ing a brightening touch of humor.
Cloud of Berkeley, the next
speaker, attacked especially the
argument concerning commerce,
saying that no alliance was neces
sary. He also feared it would lead
to war, a disastrous thing for
France.
Martin, on the second affirma
tive, said that some alliance was
necessary and one that would he
honorable, permanent, and effective
could not be made with any country
but Italy.
Ilayden showed what the result
must be in the changed attitude of
England, who would be forced to
oppose such an alliance with all
her power.
Suzzallo admitted that France
needs peace but at the same time
she must prepare for war. With
Italy as ;i close ally she would have
onlv one boundary to defend and
could devote her entire strength to
coping with Germany.
Warner, the last, speaker, defined
a close alliance as a bargain for
advantages which requires an as
sumption of real responsibilities.
He then proceeded to show that
in assuming the responsibilities,
France would gain no advantage
but be enlarged and hindered in
the pursuit of her own welfare.
The medal was in the hands of
Dr. Branner and after the decision
it was presented by him to the win
ner of the debate.
