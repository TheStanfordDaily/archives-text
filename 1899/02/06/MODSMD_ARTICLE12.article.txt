Ouk disappointment at losing
the Carnot debate this year is
made uiore intense by our expecta
tion of a victory before the contest,
and also, in a way, by the knowl
edge that many who were present
and whose opinion on the matter is
of no slight value say that they
would have given their decision for
a Stanford man. It is harder in
some ways to come very close to a
victory and then lose than it is to
be complete^ 7 out-classed. On the
other hand we may extract some
balm from the realization that our
team was the best that ever repre
sented the University. individ
ually they were without exception
excellent, and further, no man was
in any degree inferior to the others.
We have lost and we bow to the
fates, but it is without a trace of
humiliation. We are not discour
aged, but from the showing made
on Friday our prospects for the
next contest are even brighter than
they appealed before.
