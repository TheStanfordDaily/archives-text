# VARSITY DEFEATED.
## First Practice Game on the Diamond Goes to the Fireman's Fund Team by a Score of 4 to 0. 
### 
The first practice game of base
ball between the Varsity and the
Fireman's Fund team of San Fran
cisco was played on the campus
Saturday afternoon and resulted in
a victory for the visitors, the score
being 4to 0. The game was ex
tremely interesting throughout,
teams putting up comparatively
good hall.
The Fireman's Fund team is
composed of experienced players.
Several of its members were on the
alumni team last year. They all
play a hard, clean game, and make
an excellent aggregation for our
team to practice with.
The battery of the Fireman's
Fund team was exceptionally good,
Krug throwing in his characteristic
high-class style, and his catcher,
Hammond, holding him well.
Lanagan pitched for the Varsity
the first six innings and was suc
ceeded by Sherer, who finished the
game. Both men held the hitters
well. The fielding of both teams
was good in most cases, the city
boys of course surpassing our play
ers. The hitting by the Varsity
men was only fair.
The score is as follows:
fireman's fund.
