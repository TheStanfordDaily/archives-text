# Outing Club Excursion.
## 
### 
The Outing Club took its first
excursion of this semester last Sat
urday, and while only the working
members went, yet the expedition
was very successful. Those who

expected to go by wagon could not
do so on account of the heavy roads.
The club left the quad and going
direct to Neuman's found an old
trail which led them directly to
King's Mountain. The trail was
an adandoned one, but was consider
ably shorter than any other and
the view was much more beautiful
than that from the old route.
The trail starts near Neuman's
and goes up to the right of Bear
Gulch, passing through open grassy
glades interspersed with oak and
manzanita grass, and scenery which
Professor Dudley thinks compares
favorably with the Vogesen and
Schwarzwald. The club is quite en
thusiastic over their trip and some
the members expect to go to clear of
out the trail shortly and to put up
sign posts.
The next trip is scheduled for the
twenty-second of this month, but
it is likely that a trip may be made
before then.
