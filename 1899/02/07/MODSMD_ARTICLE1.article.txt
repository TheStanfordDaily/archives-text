# A 						COMMUNICATION.
## Suggestions as to the Selection and Instruction of Judges of Debates. 
### 
To Editor Daily Palo Alto. —
There seems to be some little dis
couragement over the result of the
debate. This, however, is entirely
without foundation. Every one
who heard the debate will admit
that our representatives conferred
upon themselves and upon the Uni
versity a most gratifying degree of
unqualified credit. Individually
and collectively they proved the
stuff that makes the Stanford man,
and as a team they were much su
perior to the team from across the
bay. Why one of them did not get
the Carnot medal —the stars alone
can tell.
When Berkeley suffered her last
crushing defeat on the gridiron she
gritted her teeth and swore she
would wipe up the earth with Stan
ford next year. Let every Stanford
man and woman now evince this
same spirit in regard to debaters,
and I venture the humble predic
tion that the cardinal cohorts will
soon wipe up the rostrum with the
doughty Californians. This is a
reasonable prediction to one who
reflects that the same system, in
effect, which we are now just be
ginning to adopt, for the training
of an effective corps of debaters
here, has been in operation at U.C.
from the earliest years of our
rivalry; that in spite of this, our
record as a whole has not been
really discouraging; and that this
system when once adopted has
suddenly called out an array of
talent never before suspected to be
even latent in our student body.
This is no time for tears.
However, there is one thing which
ought surely to be done in order to
secure justice in the futuie. The
following measure is proposed with
profound respect for the three gen
tlemen who kindly granted the joint
request of both universities to sit in
judgment on the late contest. The
fault in our present system of
choosing and directing judges is
not theirs, but ours.
1. Why should judges be allowed
confer, either during or after the
debate? Are the ends of justice
promoted by allowing one or two of
the judges of stronger personality
to sway the weaker? Undoubtedly
this takes place in some degree mi
almost every such conference, re
sulting in a decision which in real
ity ranges from anything less than
unanimity down to a small minor
ity. Our judges should be required
to sit in different pans of the house,
and cast their ballot without con
ference. An investigation will
probably show that this method
prevails at almost every intercol
legiate debate in the country.
2 Again there should be some
thing more tangible in the decision
when rendered.
In some univei sities, two or three
sets of judges are employed, each
set to pronounce upon particular
merits of the speakers, each indivi
dual judge seated alone. Each
judge marks on his ballot the num
ber of points on a scale of say 10
which he awards to each speaker.
These ballots soon determine not
only who has won the contest, but

the relative position of the other
contestants.
For the adoption of such a system
I wish to make strong plea: First,
because it would be most conducive
to accuracy in determining the
winning speaker, and secondly, and
especial because those defeated
would have something tangible to
show for their work. If Mr. Warner
won the Carnot medal by say 50
points, there are not a few people
(not all from Stanford, either) who
will agree that a certain Stanford
man must have made about 49
points. Did Mr. Warner win on
form of presentation, on logic, on
spontaneity —on anything? To Mr.
Warner this is a matter of small
concern, but there are five other
men who would like to know what
happened, and they are entitled to
know. Furthermore each univer
sity, and the people of the State
have a right to know, with at least
some degree of accuracy, what the
relative debating ability in the two
universities really is. The Carnot
score today stands 4 to 1, in favor of
U. C., but this record is as untruth
ful as would be the bald statement
that U. C. worked eight years before
she got a single football game, with
no reference to the respective scores.
This arrangement would be to
Berkeley's special advantage, for
the scale is surely about to turn.
3. Again, who can doubt that
prejudice insidiously influences the
minds of our greatest and best
men? Few lawyers make good
judges, and preachers, to my mind,
though they may be absolutely un
conscious of it, are the most biased
of all professional men. It is from
these two classes, mostly, that our
judges have always been choson,
and from what place? From San
Francisco and vicinity, the home,
the heart of our opponents influ
ence. The U. C. student and alum
nus is constantly met with in all
the different walks of life in the
city and towns around the bay.
Of course there are men in San
Francisco who could give a perfectly
| unprejudiced decision on a U. C.-
| Stanford debate, but there are such
men in San Jose also. Judges
should be chosen, the even num
bers equally, and 'he odd numbers
alternately, from both communities.
Our committee should be instructed
to insist upon this arrangement in
spite of all opposition. U.O. would
I then have the advantage so long
'as our regular Intercollegiate de
bate is held before a San Francisco
a udience.
This communication is presented
with the firm conviction that, with
the above reform in the choice of
and directions to judges, supple
mented by our present effective sys
i tem of semi-finals and finals, we
have nothing to fear from U. C. on
the forum in the future. We must
first recognize our rights ourselves,
then simply insist that other people
shall recognize them.
Wakrkn Mull, '99.
