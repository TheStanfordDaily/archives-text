Among the encouraging signs of
the early semester is the promising
activity of the Outing Club, of
which all too little has been heard
since last spring. The present
membership is small, but the first,
trip, taken last Saturday, was a
marked success in spite of recent
rains. By the twenty-second, for
which date the next outing is
scheduled, it is to be hoped that
many will have handed their
names to the secretary. There are
two missions which the Outing Club
is well calculated to fill. One is to
give each individual who joins, in
a day's outing, a pleasant time and
a change from engrossing studies;
and another is to gather together,
trip by trip, data concerning the
surrounding country, which will be
of increasing value as it becomes
fuller and more definite. With the
near-by mountains mapped as to
road and trail and described as to
accommodation for the day or week,
there will be no excuse for any stu
dent to mope his Saturdays away
with attempts to work which are
mere vaporizing, and to graduate
knowing nothing of the beauties of
landscape with which every por
tion of the Santa Clara valley and
its mountainous rim abounds.
