# CAN TAKE TRIPS.
## Result of the Conference of the Musical Clubs' Representatives With the Faculty Committee. 
### 
Today the faculty committee on
student affairs returned to the musi
cal clubs an approved list of men
from which members making con
cert tours this semester must be
chosen.
This list was made from one con
taining all probable candidates for
the tours, which the clubs submit
ted at the request of the committee
two weeks ago. Some revision in
the iist was made, but the whole
action of the committee shows an
attitude more favorable to the clubs
than has been understood. Since
the report of the committee prohib
iting the clubs from representing
the University abroad, this form of
college activity has been at a low
ebb.
The committee consisting of F.B.
Riley, P. K. Oilman, and Ralph
Arnold, chosen by the clubs to con
fer again with the faculty commit
tee, were given to understand that
the reports of the decision against
the clubs had been greatly exagger
ated; that there was no intention
of permanently forbidding extended
tours, and that the action at Christ
mas time was taken because the
committee shrank from the task of
pruning the clubs, as had been done
to some extent the year before, and,
as a result of which, it was claimed
much of last year's great success
was due.
The understanding now is that
the clubs may make all reasonable
tours, but the men who go must be,
in each instance, approved by the
committee.
The clubs will meet during the
week to discuss the new situation.
