# Company K. in the Philippines.

### 
Reports have again reached us
that Company K, First California
Volunteers, has been in action.
This makes the second time our
Stanford men have been subjected
to the heaviest fire and the most
trying ordeals.
The last time, in the battle of
Manila, they were thrust out on
the extreme right flank and kept in
a trench and an exposed rice field
for twenty-four hours, unrelieved.
Now under Cunningham, captain
of Company K, they were among
the lirst to charge. Cutting their
way through swarms of the oppos
ing force they cleared the distance
from I'aco to Santana. In connec
tion with this last fight, a strange
incident has occurred. George L.
Rees, ex-'OO, while in the army
held as his place in platoon, No. 1,
rear rank. Upon his discharge,
his old mess-mate, J. J. Dewers,
was given bis place in the file, and
thus far Dewers is the only man
from the First California reported
dead.
