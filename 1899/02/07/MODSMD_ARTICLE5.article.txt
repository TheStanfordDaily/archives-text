## 
### 
Yesterday afternoon a prelimi
nary try-out for distance men was
held on the track. No attempt
was made for fast running and no
time was taken. The purpose of
the run was to Wring out new men
and to give them some experience
in their event. Smith and Wil
liams, as old men, did not run for

placeß so much as to coach the new
aspirants, the latter setting pace,
and the former keeping up strag
glers. The day was so cold that
the pace was set even slower than
it might otherwise have been. Sev
eral new men showed up very en
couragingly. The first two places
were taken by Chad bourne, '02,
and Bristow Adams, '00. Several
men who are counted on to do
good work in the distances this
year are sick with the grip now
and so were unable to run. On
next Monday at the same time
there will be a try-out in the half
mile.
