# Stanford Outing Club.
## 
### 
During the full of 1897 the
thought came to several Stanford
men who were in the habit of taking
Saturday outings that a very slight
degree of organization would be
sufficient to induce more students
to do the same. Accordingly on
November 12, a meeting was called
by Professor Fairclough. The num
bers who responded proved the
timeliness of the plan to form an
Outing Club, and this being done,
Professor Fairclough was chosen
president and W. A. Cannon sec
retary. The club, which numbered
twenty-five at that time, grew
within a year to a membership of
forty-four. Many pleasant outings
were taken from time to time and
once it was decided to hold monthly
meeting on the quad. This plan
failed of systematic execution,
though on one occasion talks were
given by W. W. Price and Milnor
Roberts on the birds and mammals
of the region.
It is to be regretted that one part
of the original plan dwelt on at
some length by the club has not as
yet been worked up. The plan was
to record whatever new facts were
gathered on any trip about the
country traversed, for the benefit of
those planning future expeditions.
These records might take the shape
of maps showing trails as well as
roads, tables of hotel club rates,
descriptions of country covered,
and lists of plants and animals ob
served or collected. The office of
librarian was created to provide a
custodian for such records, which
would be of undoubted value, and
which it is hoped the future will
yet produce.
The simple plan on which the
club was organized has been con
tinued. This year's officers are:
President, Professor \V. 11. Dudley;
secretary, J. E. Wilson; librarian,
A. M. Strong. Any person con
nected with the University is eli
gible to membership. There are
no dnes and no regular meetings.
Announcements of prospective
trips are made in ample time to al
low all members, and any others
who wish, to plan to go.
