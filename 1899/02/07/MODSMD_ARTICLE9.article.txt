There is still a scarcity of men
on the baseball Held. Last night,
during the first part of the practice,
there were not eighteen men in
suits, and the team was obliged to
wait over half an hour before there
was a sufficient number out to form
a first and second nine. This is
neither loyalty to one's college nor
good policy for a prospective candi
date. There is ample opportunity
for making the Varsity, and every
one who plays baseball should be
out for his position.
