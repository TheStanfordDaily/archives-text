# AGAINST TAXATION.
## The 						San Francisco "Argonaut" Strongly in Favor of Exempting the University. 
### 
The following editorial in the
Argonaut of February 0 gives a
generous and appreciative, yet dis
criminative estimate of Stanford's
claim to tax exemption. Therein no
doubt but that such a statement
meets the hearty concurrence of
that part of California's population
which is alive to the benefits which
it i.s tile work of the University,
with the untiring aid of Mrs. Stan
ford, to dispense. We give it in
full :
In declaring that of three hun
dred Eastern graduates from Stan
ford University two hundred and
fifty have settled in California with
their families, President Jordan
gave a sufficient reason to the Sen
ate Judiciary Committee for the
submission of a constitutional
amendment confirming the Stan
ford trust and incidentally exempt
ing the University from taxation.
The raising of the question of the
validity of the trust created by Mr.
Stanford is doubtless a waste of
time, but if there is any ground for
it, the proposed amendment would
cure that defect while relieving the
University of its obviously unjust
and unwise tax-paying burden.
There should be no hesitancy what
ever in submitting this amendment
to the voters of the Stale, and there
can be no,doubt of its prompt adop
tion.
Without intending in any way
to minimize the value of other bene
factions of California!) millionaires,
or the appreciation in which these
benefactions are held, it must be
evident that the one which the
Stanford University represents is
of surpassing value. For practical
reasons alone, to say nothing of the
appropriatenessof a becoming grace
on the part of the people in ac
knowledging the benefaction, it is
wrong to tax the University. Mr.
Lick's handsome gift of a great
observatory escapes taxation be
cause it is a part of the State's edu
cational system. This is true also
of the Hopkins gift, the Wilmerd
ing gift, the Flood gift, the Cogswell
gift. Of all the great benefactions of
California!) millionaires, the Stan
ford University stands alone as a
victim of fixation. This is unjust
unwise, and hurtful discrimina
tion. 10very dollar diverted from
the institution represents a crip
pling of its usefulness lo that ex
tent; and as the value of ilie prop
erty in the trust is very great, the
amount of the tax is heavy.
The benefits brought by the
Stanford University are various,
and its ability to make them of the
best account is hampered by no
political influence. Its trustees
owe no debts to a political gov
ernor. Its wealthy pupils can not,
by any sort of pressure, secure di
plomas on any basis other than
merit. Its certificate of graduation
is a cachet of worth. It does not
have to fit its curriculum to any
need except that which a thorough
education creates. Its exemption
from taxatioif would not introduce
the element of political control into
its management. Its complete in
dependence and the practical

character of its instruction open it
to the whole world, a fact that its
roster amply demonstrates. Its
income will never be imperiled by
considerations of political expedi
ency in voting its appropriation.
It will never become a burden
upon the State.
The time has passed when Cali
fornia can afford to place a tax
upon education furnished by its
generous citizens. The work of
Stanford University is spreading
the fame of California throughout
Christendom. The remarkable pro
portion of its non-resident gradu
ates who settle in California shows
some of the immediate good that it
is accomplishing, but that is the
smallest. It is giving to California
the reputation of being a great edu
cational center, where the present
living needs of humanity are met,
and young men and young women
made to lay an educated finger on
the throbbing pulse of the world.
From such instruction as it gives
a way is opened for the solution of
the problems that threaten the
stability of society. Its motive is
wholly disinterested. Its plan foi
the perpetuation of its rich endow
ment brings a commercial benefit
to none, and contemplates solely
the fitting of young men and wo
men for the higher practical con
cerns of life. To cripple it with
taxation is to discourage other Cali
fornia!! millionaires from creating
splendid benefactions f<;i* the pub
lic good. Such a policy would be
petty, and wholly antagonistic to
the broad and generous spirit of
the people of the State.
The devotion of Mrs. Stanford to
the welfare of the institution should
l>e a sufficient inspiration to the
submission of the proposed amend
ment. With her large wealth
she might have been dazzling the
American colonies of Europe, or
spending vapid years at home in
the butterfly existence that wealth
so easily commands and finds so
much difficulty in escaping. In
stead of that, she has been an in
spiration to all other Californian
millionaires. She has always given,
and still gives, and will continue to
give, all that is best in her strong
personality to the building up of
the University. She has laid aside
the great pleasant world, and put
the whole of her uncommonly force
ful strength into the University.
She finds her highest enjoyment in
studying its needs, in placing her
self upon <i level with the students,
and observing the world through
t heir eager, expectant, hopeful eyes.
The University is her home, the
students her children. The innu
merable things that she has done
for those enjoying the benefits of
her bounty may never be known in
their entirety. It was her singular
shrinking from notoriety that in
duced her, a year ago, to make a
present of a million dollars from
lier private fortune, on the stipula
tion that the trustees should not
permit the fact to become public;
and none needs to be told what
sacrifices the production of so large
a sum entailed at that time. It
would be an unworthy rebuke to
the generosity and patriotism of
this remarkable woman to deny her
i just and resonable request that the

unnesessary burden now resting
upon the usefulness of her benefac
tion be removed. California has
the intelligence to show its appreci
ation of her unselfishness, her de
votion, and her unassuming gener
osity.
