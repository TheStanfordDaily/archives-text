We so often call in these col
umns for "more enthusiasm on the
bleachers" or for a greater attend
ance at some forensic contest that
we fear the expressions are becom
ing trite and are lost upon our
readers. In our busy moments we
do not think of the effect of our
presence, small though it may
seem to us, upon those who strug
gle upon the platform or upon the
athletic field in order that Stanford
may be assured of worthy and
skilled representation in her inter
collegiate contests. When we stop
to think we can only realize that
such activities are fostered and
sustained by the student body at
large and that their prosperity is
in direct proportion to the energy
and attention which the students
devote to them.
While all due allowance is made
for the love of the individual con
testant for his alma mater, it is evi
dent that where there is life and
action and hearty, healthy enthus
iasm—enthusiasm which comes di
rectly from a real interest, there is
strong, virile action. And we all
know what can be expected from
careless inattention. We have all
felt at times that we should attend
some contest —but we have some
thing else to do —we guess that

there will he plenty of other people
present and our absence will not he
noticed.
What we should do and what we
must do if we ever expect to recover
from the slump into which we
have apparently fallen this year,
is to take an individual interest in
each and every event which needs
encouragement. We can not all
make the team: there isn't room
for us; but we can all stand behind
them to cheer them on and make
them feel that we are with them for
all that that there is in lis.
