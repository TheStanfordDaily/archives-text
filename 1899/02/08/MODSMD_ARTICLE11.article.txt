Resolutions adopted by the Board
of Directors of the Coronado Beach
Summer School upon the death of
Dr. W. W. Thoburn, for two years
a teacher in said school:
Whereas, Dr. \V. W. Thoburn,
late of Stanford University, has
been called to the higher life, leav
ing his faniily and friends, the
otlicere, teachers, and students of
this University, those who have
been his pupils everywhere, and all
who have come into harmonious
relations with his rare nature, to
mourn his departure from them,
but yet leaving them all deeply
thankful that they have known
him; that he was their teacher, as
sociate, and friend; that they have
been made richer by his wise and
spiritual teaching, and better by
the beautiful purity of his example
and life;
Whereas, also, the Coranado
Beach Summer School was blessed
and greatly aided the first two
years of its existence by his pres
ence, the spiritual, ethical, and
scientific teaching, and the wise
counsel and most helpful and gen
erous co-operation of Dr. Thoburn;
And Whereas, also, we desire to
put into words, though they are
inadequate, an expression of our
grateful sense of what the worid,
and especially of what this school
and its directors and pupils owe to
Dr. Thoburn, and to send this mes
sage to his family and friends and
to his University;
Now, Therefore, Be it resolved by
the Board of Directors of the Cor
onado Beach Summer School:
That we hold the memory of Dr.
\V. W. Thoburn in grateful and
affectionate remembrance; that the
world is better because he has lived
in it, and wiser because he has
taught in it; that he still lives in
his teaching and work; that his
message of personal righteousness
will be passed on to others; and
that his example and life are a
beacon light encouraging the faint
hearted and weary, causing men to
look upward and heavenward and
guiding them onward to what is
high and noble and true.
That copies of these resolutions,
duly certified by the vice-president
of this Board, be forwarded to Mrs.
Thoburn and Dr. David Starr .Jor
dan, President of Stanford Univer
sity.
