Elutoh Daily Palo Alto. —Our
disappointment over i he result of the
late debate is natural. The excel
lent showing made by the Stanford
men in the aggregate and certain
traits of individual brilliancy, to
gether with tiie failure of any one
debater from U. C. to stand out in
incontestable supremacy, left us un
prepared for an adverse decision.
Hut, of course, the judges were
right in attempting to detach the
one man of individual all-round
superiority. That was their duty.
Their sincerity is above question;
perhaps also, from their point of
view, their wisdom. But there is
another point of view—thatofyour
average university student, with
his abundance of youth and some
inevitable immaturity. For him,
we take it, the debate is instituted.
A fine question of standards is
therefore raised. Shall one man
win by sheer maturity and another
be shut out for betraying alertness,
eagerness, spontaniety, and a littie
of the fire that burns in the very
corpuscles of his blood? If so, the
prospect is discouraging—for uni
versity students. Youth is de
barred from success, not by defects
of native ability or training, but
only by the qualities which are a
part of the definition of youth. 1
trust my meaning is clear. I do
not speak of youth as measured by
years alone — red corpuscles some
times survive legal majority. Nor
am 1 speaking for one university
more than another. As to a rein
ed}', I would not have very young
men chosen for judges, but I wish
there were some manner of hinting
delicately to judges that universi
ties are the special abodes of young
men. A.
