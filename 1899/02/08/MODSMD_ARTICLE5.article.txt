Miss Barstow was greeted last
evening by a large audience. The
program consisted of three com
plete sonatas which well displayed
the artist's ability. The first num
ber was Opus 7 by Edward F.
Schneider, brother of F. A. Schnei
der, '98, and a Californian, who is
rapidly coming to prominent notice
in Europe. The first movement.
Allegro risoluto, was quite disap
pointing, rarely rising above the
commonplace, but the Andante
seemed capable of much sympathe
tic interpretation,mure, apparently,
than Miss Barstow chose to give it.
By far the best is the third move
ment, Allegro grazinso, with a deli
cate dainty motif and a rhytymic
treatment somewhat suggestive of
Grieg. The second and third son
atas have both been interpreted be
fore a Stanford audience by Mr.
Savannah.
The first movement of the Beet
hoven (Opus 24), was rendered
with great appreciation' and fine
expression, but the Adagio was
even more successful and showed
more feeling than any other num
ber on the program.
The (irieg Sonata (Opus 8), a
considerably more difficult number,
was, as a whole, the best of the
program, the last movement being
especially well rendered.
Too much praise can not be
given to the pianiste, Miss Frances
Dana Janes, who is a player with
much sympathy and feeiing, as
well as a skillful performer and an
excellent accompanist
Miss Barstow apparently has no
fear of technical difficulties, and it
is in numbers that display such
that she is at her best.
