# THE
						JUNIOR QUAD.
## All Departments Progressing Favorably.—Art Work Good.—Bowman Writes Prize Story. 
### 
The first pages of copy for the
IVJOU Annual have been sent to the
printers this week and the re
mainder of the book is well under
way. The Stanley-Taylor Com
pany has taken the printing and
promises a book typographically
superior to former Annuals. The
cover in view is, in material and
design, exceptionally attractive.
The award, which has just been
announced, for the prize story, has
gone to L. MacF. Bowman for his
"Story of a Collar," a very read
able lale of love and war, which is
handled artistically. Verse has
been promised by Charles lv. Field
and Will 11. Irwin.
The University abounds in good
artists this year, and the Quad will
use them to advantage. Among
these are Bristow Adams, 11. K.
Culver, L. McF. Bowman, li. W.
Boroughs, W. 1). Lawshe, C. DeQ.
Whittle, 11. J. Sterrett, W. It. Dav
enport, and several others--fifteen
in all. No poor work need be ac
cepted for the lack of good mater
ial.
As to the "joshes," the Quad pre
fers to ''say nothing, but saw
wood." It will go so far, however,
as to announce that the class his
tory will be presented in verse
form with intent to amuse. It will
he profusely illustrated by W. I).
Lawshe. The "grinds" pioper will
appear in force.
As this has been essentially a
year of architectural advancement,
a department will be reserved for
University improvements, with il
lustrations, and the book itself will
he dedicated to Thomas Wei ton
Stanford, the founder of the new
Library. *
