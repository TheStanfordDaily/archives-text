Some time ago the staff of the
Daily Palo Alto issued to the
staff of the Sequoia a challenge to
a game of baseball. Since then the
various members of a prospective
nine representing our esteemed con
temporary have declared that they
were willing and anxious to accept
that challenge, but we have re
ceived no official acceptance. We
were in earnest when we issued the
challenge and we would like to be
lieve they are in earnest when they
say they will accept, but we shall
be certain of it only when we re
ceive word that they will meet us.
We do not wish this to dwindle
into a warfare of mere words; ac
tion is more significant and de
cisive. If, however, our challenge
does not receive some reply one
way or the other within a few days,
we shall lay claim to the title of
the best purely literary baseball
team on the campus by right of
forfeiture.
