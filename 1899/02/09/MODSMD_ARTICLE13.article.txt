Tiik attention of the members of
the Junior Class is called to the
slow manner in which the assess
ments for the 1900 Quad are being
paid. As a deposit of $300 must be
made before any work is done on
the book, it is necessary that our
Juniors should come to the assist
ance of those who have charge of
the Annual and pay up. The as
sessment is light, and if every mem
ber will contribute his share no
further assessment need be levied,
and the Annual can be published
without much difficulty. Let the
members of the Junior Class con
sider that the editor and business
manager can not get out an An
nual without money, no matter
how efficient they may be. As the
assessment was levied bv vote of
the class, every member should
stand by the class and pay as soon

as possible. The Class of 1900 is
the largest in the University and it
should not he backward in any
class enterprise. Don't "stand oft"
the collectors, hut pay now.
