## A 						Letter from Stanford Volunteers Telling of the Receipt of the Christmas Box. 
### 
The following letter from the
Stanford boys in the Philippines
has jnst been received:
Manila, Dec. 26, 1898.
My Dear Dr. Jordan.â€”Your
letter on behalf of the alma mater
has been received by the Stanford
boys of the Eighth Army Corps. The
boxes, too, have arrived and are in
perfect condition. The intellectual
as well as the physical man was
most appropriately provided for.
We have now a small circulating
library, perhaps the only one in the
army. The books and magazines
sent afford us many delightful
hours which without such genial
companions are becoming mono
tonous and next to waste of time.
Our alma mater, always a gener
ous and "cherishing mother," still
ever practical, recognized that men
and especially soldiers can not live
by faith or even books alone, and
therefore spread before us gifts to
cheer the inner man at yule tide.
An eight months' experience in a
volunteer army is conducive to the
belief that every one of us could
relish Encina grub in its most de
generate times and carry twenty
four hours with Herculean ease and
with supreme contentment.
Although we missed the Thanks
giving game, we experienced a
pleasure which, from the score, no
one of you there on the field could
easily have experienced. Owing to
a false cablegram we enjoyed for
three days the proud delights of
victors. But let Berkeley rejoice
this year. It requires occasional
defeats to develop the determined
man. Our long line of victories
has gradually dimmed the annual
rejoicing over the success of our
sturdy athletes, but next year we
will once more fully appreciate our
victory.
The remembrances you send and
the sentiments you express endear
still more, if that were possible, our
beloved University. It was your
kindly interest in us all and your
sympathy in whatever hardships
we might be enduring that ever
made our duty easier and more
pleasant.
Several of our number here have
experienced most providential es
capes, both from the lead of the
enemy and the disease of the tropics.
It greaves us all to learn of the
death of a fellow student who
served his country a hemisphere
away. Fortunately it was neces
sary to sacrifice but few lives in the
war, but whatever services Stan
ford's sons rendered their country,
were cheerfully given. It is natural
that a student's training for civil
duties is not conducive to content
ment with the prolonged activity
of garrison duty, however enthus
iastic he may have been during
hostilities. You may rest assured
that so soon as the Government
sees fit to recall us it will be a de
light, once more to meet Stanford
people, to " review" the freshmen,
to stroll in the old quad, and to
dine in the new restaurant.
We thank you all for the books,
magazines, and articles of food. We

thank you all for remembering
those so far away from the old quad
and the new quad, from Encina
and Roble, from the committee on
student affairs, the Registrar's of
fice, the post office, and the Palo
Alto depot.
Kindest regards to Mrs. Jordan
and yourself and all our dear Stan
ford friends, from the Stanford boys
of the Eighth Army Corps, Man
ila, P. I. John M. Switzeb,
For the Boys.
