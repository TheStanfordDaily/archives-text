— From the publication of the
University of Indiana it appears
that an effort is being made to stop
the annual freshman-sophomore
"scrap" and to suppress the pub
lication of "bogies."
—Treasurer Allen of the Califor
nia Athletic Association has pre
sented his report of college finances.
Receipts totaled $770.35; expendi
tures and unsettled bills, $111)3.83;
total indebtedness, $422.48.
—The University of Michigan is
quite wrought up over the agitation
by Detroit papers of a scheme to
move the institution to that city
from Ann Arbor. There seems,
however, little danger of such a cat
astrophe.
—President Harper of the Univer
sity ot Chicago recently announced
that during the past year gifts ag
gregating more than $400,000 have
been made to that institution.
These included land from Marshall
Field, adjoining the university
grounds, and money from John D.
Rockefeller.
—There is a wide diversity of
opinion among all classes of people
as to the ultimate value of a col
lege education. The Herald, of
Brown University, has taken the
trouble to draw up a free compar
ison of public men, from a pub
lished list of the present members
of Congress. In the Senate fifty
five per cent, have been through
some college, university, or profes
sional school, while forty-five per
cent, were forced to enter life with
out that training. In the House
of Representatives fifty-three per
cent, are college-bred and forty
seven per cent, are not. This
would seem to show botli classes
equal, but it must be borne in
mind that of our male population
only about two in every hundred
go to advanced schools; and when
this fact is considered, the predom
inance of college-bred men in Con
gress is realized. Their chances
are undoubtedly far superior.
