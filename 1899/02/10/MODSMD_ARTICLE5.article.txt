# PRESIDENT KELLOGG'S REPORT.
## Facts and Figures of California's Progressâ€”Some Comparisons With Stanford. 
### 
The biennial report of President
Kellogg of the University of Cali
fornia, just issued, gives in an in
teresting way a summary of the
growth of the university during
the last two years. In these two
years the number of students at
Berkeley has increased from 1336
to 1665, a number of new build
ings, mainly temporary, have been
erected, and some new depart
ments established. Perhaps the
most striking event of the two
years is Mrs. Hearst's architect
ural plan for permanent buildings
for the university. The report
outlines the conception of the plan,
the competition of the hundred
architects at Antwerp, and the se
lection of the best eleven, who will
perfect their plans and submit
them again in August, 1899. If
these plans shall finally be real
ized the State University will have
buildings worthy of its beautiful
site and of the State.
During these two years the $250,-
000 appropriated by the Legisla
ture of 1895 has been turned into
the group of affiliated college build
ings in San Francisco, the medical
department already occupying its
new quarters. The Legislature of
1896 also largely increased the per
manent income of the university
through an increase in the tax
levy. The gift of the Flood Estate
President Kellogg takes as indica
tive of an increased interest in the
university among persons of wealth
throughout the State. The estab
lishment of the high-sounding
"College of Commerce" is dwelt
upon, as well as the large increase
in attendance in the graduate de
partment. Of most importance
perhaps in its effect in turning
preparatory students toward the
university is the establishment of
tifty-six annual scholarships of the
value of $125 each.
Apparently the impression pre
vails at Berkeley that the State Uni
versity is largely a "local institu
tion" ; and this impression Presi
dent Kellogg tries to combat. "It
is unfortunate," he says,"that new
comers so often prefer to give their
new places of residence for publica
tion in the Register rather than
those from which they have come,
tUus giving rise to the erroneous
opinion that the attendance at the
university is confined to California,
and mainly to the Bay region. Per
haps the publication in the Register
of the birthplaces as well as the
supposed places of residence of stu
dents would tend to remove the
impression, now too common, that
the university enjoys mainly local
patronage." To register students
from their birthplaces, instead of
from their "supposed places of res
idence," besides making the show
ing desired, would doubtless be
highly entertaining to the residents
of the Hay region.
Below we print a summary from
the last Register of California of
these "supposed places of residence,"
and by way of comparison add the
statistics of our Register for the
same year. It may also be added
that, while there does not seem to

be any impression in Palo Alto
that Stanford is a "local institu
tion," the large number of students
attributed to Santa Clara county
is due to the same erratic habit of
which President Kellogg com
plains.
Forty-two per cent, of the stu
dents at Berkeley are young wo
men, and President Kellogg sug
gests that the time has come to
allow women a representation upon
the faculty; at least, he urges, there
ought to be a dean for the young
women of the university.
