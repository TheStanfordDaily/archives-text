There is much to commend in
the plan of the sophomores to chal
lenge the freshmen to a field-day.
Such contests, especially among
under-classmen, are desirable in
that they tend to bring out mater
ial which can later be developed
into the stuff that makes Varsity
teams. Men will come out for an
interclass contest who would hesi
tate to train for the Varsity. It
is a false modesty and altogether
wrong, but still it is always pres
ent. It is noticeable that a fresh
man never makes use of the track
avowedly with the purpose of de
veloping, if possible, into a Varsity
man —they are usually out "just
for their health." But a man will
try for his class team, and in this
way often valuable men are discov
ered.
The only objection to the plan is
the possibility that the freshmen
may have too many contests on
their hands, and so may run a
danger of some of their members
becoming overtrained. It is cus
tomary for the Oakland high
school and the Lowell high school
to send down teams to meet our
freshmen, an'd last year 1901 went
to Reno, and the track manager
has recently received word from
them again concerning a meet this
year with 1902. The spirit of the
sophomores is commendable, and
such a contest would be profitable
provided other meets do not inter
fere.
