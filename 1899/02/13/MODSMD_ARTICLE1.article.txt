# LADIES' NIGHT.
## Encina Club Gives a Characteristic and Enjoyable Reception to the Women of the University. 
### 
Encina Club held its tirst Ladies'
Night Friday evening, and scored
a pronounced success. The big
club room, which has already in
the short year of the club's exis
tence been the scene of so many
hilarious masculine rallies, put on
its best appearance for the occas
ion, and for one evening the women
of the University experimented
with the billiard tables, inspected
the team pictures, and explored the
Encina boudoirs to their hearts'
content. Four hundred invita
tions had been issued, and few re
grets were returned. When the
program began, at half-past eight,
the room was packed as it has
never been packed before.
The program was unconventional
and out of the usual order. The
hosts tried to present a typical En
cina "jolly," and the visitors were
amused it not edilied. President
Clark Leiter made an address of
welcome and introduced the " Bug
house quartet in their celebrated
European discords.'" The quartet,
which numbered live, by the way,
gave a very clever imitation of a
country male quartet's rendering
of the Wabash" and other popu
lar tunes of the day, including a
human pipe organ "turn" which
took the crowd. W. 1). Lawshe,W.
11. Davenport, W. 11. Irwin, W. A.
Irwin as singers, Alfred llaslacher
as "professor," and some pictur
esque misfit dress suits formed the
'' quartet."
Claire Strohn followed with a
new clog dance, which was enthus
iastically encored, as was W. M.
Erb's rendition of some "Casey"
stories in rich and genuine Irish
accent. W. 11. Irwin gave a talk
on the Morosco melodrama with
samples of acting, and told, as an
encore, the story of the " Professor's
Baseball Game." R. K. Culver
was next, with one of his ever pop
ular "Chalk-talks," this one treat
ing of >St. Valentine's day and val
entines in general.
The floor was then cleared for
the event of the evening, a very
funny cake walk. Card and Fer
rari, Bowman and Whittle, Mc-
Dougal and Warren, and Strohti
and llaslacher were the contes
tants, and Ralph Filcher acted as
master of ceremonies. After an
amusing contest, Strohn and llas
lacher carried away the cake, with
McDougal and Warren a close
second.
The visitors were invited upstairs
at t lie conclusion of the program,
and passed the rest of the evening
inspecting the rooms. Twenty-six
rooms had I heir company fronton;
in nearly all of these refreshments
were served, and the rooms were
crowded till 11:20 and "lights out."
Tne patronesses were Mesdames
Planner, Griflin, Wood, Elliott,
Green, Peirce, and Pease.
Professors Campbell and Lin
coln, Mrs. Pease, Miss Ray, and 11.
K. Culver acted as judges of the
cake walk.
