# Football Kicking Contest.
## 
### 
Something new in the line of
preliminary football training has
been adopted by the University of
Pennsylvania in an endeavor to
develop good kickers and catchers.
It is in the shape of a contest be
tween footballcandidates. The win
ner must surpass all others in all
round kicking and handling of
the ball, and as a reward has the
honor of keeping a $100 challenge
cup until the next year, when he
again has to meet all comers. On
the sides of the cup are spaces for
the engraving of the names of the
various holders of the prize. Be
sides this a smaller cup is presented
to the man who wins any one of
the three contests of which the
challenge cup competition is made
up. The contest is to take place
about May 1.
The rules are very minute and
intricate in detail, and a record of
each man's work is carefully kept.
The first is a driving contest. Ihe
measurements are made in such a
way that the low, hard drive will
count for much more than a kick
after the Herschberger style. Each
contestant has a dozen trials, and
from the candidates the best eight
are taken for a tinal test. The
kicks are made both with and
against the wind. The men are
divided into pairs and accuracy is
very necessary, as the men iiick to
one another and if the kick is
caught by the opponent lie gets an
advantage of live yards for every
fair catch.
The second contest is one in punt
ing. Place kicking and kicks for
goals also enter into this competi
tion, distance and accuracy count
ing equally.
The third contest is drop kick
ing. It is, perhaps, the most im
portant as it includes drop kicking
for goals, punt-outs, goals for place
ment, and kick off. There are
twelve drop kicks allowed each con
testant, three from the 30-yard line,
three from the 40-yard line, and
three from the angles near the 20-
yard line. The punt-outs are made
at different angles also, the kicker
being compelled to stand five yards
from the side lines and to give a
chance for a fair catch.
The winner of the challenge cup
must secure the highest number ot
points in each of tlie three contests,
and should he win the loving cup
he is not entitled to any of the
prizes for the separate contests, but
they will be awarded to the next
in order. The football players at
Pennsylvania are said to be very
enthusiastic over the contests, and
it will tend to bring out new foot
ball material and strengthen the
old.
