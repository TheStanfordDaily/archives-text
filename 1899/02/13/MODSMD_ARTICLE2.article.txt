# Sunday Sermon.

President White of the Univer
sity of Southern California gave a

thoughtful and eloquent sermon in
the chapel yesterday morning. In
the early part of the service Miss
Winifred Morgan rendered a violin
solo, and at the close Mrs. Ross
and Dr. Little sang a duet. Fol
lowing is a synopsis of President
White's discourse upon the differ
ence between a really religious life
and a purely moral one :
When the young man asked,
" Master, what shall 1 do to inherit
eternal life?" Jesus told him of one
great lack, and he went away sor
rowful. It is a serious mistake to
teach that human goodness and
morality count for nothing, since
God measures every man by his
true worth. But is it true, as
implied in Christ's statement, that
''there is none good save One?"
that there is no good man? In
mere uprightness there can he no
Virtue; that is only matter of com
mon decency. Neighborly minis
trations in time of sickness and
ordinary charity are no more than
the repayment of a debt to com
mon humanity. Human sympathy
is what binds us together and
makes life bearable and happy; it
is as much to be desired for its
present benefits as though there
were no hereafter.
Because He does not need our
ministrations, nothing in kind can
be returned to God for his bounti
ful goodness to us. And that is
why He is good and we are not.
The only way, then, that we can
repsiy God is to follow the injunc
tion of Christ to " Love the Lord
thy God with all thy heart, and
with all thy soul, and with all thy
mind, and with all thy strength,
and thy neighbor as thyself." We
can praise God and help our fellow
man; this is all Hecan receive from
us.
It is a grave duty that this only
service which can come unto Him,
be not withheld. Strange to say,
the majority of men seem to recog
nize a duty to their fellows and
entirely overlook the duty they owe
to God. They refuse to honor God
personally; they don't acknowledge
any debt to Him, they feel no ac
quaintance with the Most High,
and they never establish relation
ship with Him. Religion is a mat
ter between a personal soul and a
personal God. The Creator must
certainly appreciate filial response
from His children. Man's greatest
obligation is that of response to
divine love; he can not assume or
ignore moral obligation ; it is
placed on him at birth. It he fails
to requite God's love, his is the in
scription written upon the ceiling
of Belshazzar's temple, "Ye have
been weighed in the balance and
found wanting."
