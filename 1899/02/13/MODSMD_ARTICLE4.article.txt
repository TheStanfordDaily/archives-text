# MUSICAL CLUBS.
## With the Prospect of an Easter Tour, the Varsity Clubs Are Reviving and Rehearsing Regularly. 
### 
The Varsity Glee and Mandolin
Clubs met together last Thursday
evening, and after a short rehear
sal, discussed the present situation
and future policy of the organiza
tions.
Jt was unanimously decided to
inaugurate regular rehearsals again,
and to endeavor to get the clubs
into the best possible condition
under the circumstances. A report
that the faculty committee has
granted an Easter tour awakened
much of the old time enthusiasm.
But in denying the clubs some of
their best material for the tour, the
committee, it seems, has, at least
for the time being, almost fatally
crippled both organizations. Their
action coupled with the fact that
two or three men, of whom a great
deal was expected, have not re
turned to the University this se
mester, makes it an open question
whether or not the clubs can pre
pare a program up to the old stand
ard. But they at least intend to
make the trial. Leader Van Kaath
oven is of the opinion that the
glee could get into' touring condi
tion by Easter time.
'• We still have the material left
to give a first class program," he
said; " not as versatile or varied a
one as before, perhaps, but an even
ing that will be entirely satisfac
tory."
Ralph Arnold, leader of the Man
dolin Club, is of the same opinion.
" As far as the Mandolin Club is
concerned," he said, l> with plenty
of rehearsals and hard work we can
still have a club in most respects
as good as ever."
The clubs will begin rehearsals
immediately and hope to be in trim
for local events in -a short time.
They again expressed their willing
ness to aid in the training-house
benefit concert whenever it should
be arranged.
Just now there is room for some
new material in both clubs, and
any aspirant for membership in
either one should see the respective
leaders at once and be given atrial.
After the meeting Thursday even
ing the clubs revived a custom of
former years and went singing
through the quad and over to lloble,
where they tendered the young
women an old-time serenade.
The Banjo Club, which made
such an excellent impression at the
San Jose concert last semester, is
rebearsing occasionally and will be
ready to assist in local concerts. If
the spirit of the organization last
semester is maintained, nnd the
excellent work continued, of which
there at present seems to be some
doubt, the club should be ready to
combine with the other Varsity
clubs in the tours next year.
The Girls' G lee Club, recently or
ganized and consisting now of
21 members, shows a gratifying
amount of interest and enthus
iasm in its well attended rehearsals,
which are held twice a week. The
young women are fortunate in hav
ing Mrs. Wright of Santa Barbara
as leader. She is a thorough musi
cian and has had a wide experi
ence in musical clubs. The accom

panist, Miss May Hurlburt, is a
finished pianist, having for several
years been an instructor in the
Metropolitan College of Music of
New York City.
The club has very well mastered
Mendelssohn's " Ave Maria" and
is at work on a lullaby and several
bright and up-to-date compositions
which they have received from the
East. The club will likely sing at
Mrs. Branner's "Stevenson Tea"
on February 18, and will have a
number on the program of the
training-house concert when it is
arranged.
The Ladies Mandolin Club, also
just reorganized, has in Miss L. Mc-
Dougald an able leader, and much
is expected of it. This club, it is
hoped, will also take part in some
campus concerts, playing with the
Varsity Mandolin Club, as it did
with such success two years ago.
The Symphony Orchestra, under
the leadership of Professor Young,
seems to have practically disbanded.
This is regretable, especially as
there has been no regular Univer
sity orchestra organized this col
lege year, and the utility and de
sirability of such an organization,
particularly in the second semester,
is great. There is abundance of
talent on the campus and in Palo
Alto, which should again be brought
together.
