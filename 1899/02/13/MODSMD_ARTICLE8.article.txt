Club to the ladies of the University
on Friday night was successful be

such informal entertainments can
not be given oftener in Encina. So
long as they did not conflict with
other activities it would be agree
able to have them occur more fre

considerably greater frequency and
still not become tiresome. At least,
twice a year would not be too
