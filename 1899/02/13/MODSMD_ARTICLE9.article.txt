Such acts of vandalism as smear
ing with paint the sphinxes at the
entrance of University Avenue and
daubing the door of the Registrar's
office have never before been com
mitted at Stanford University. In
previous years backstops, board
walks, and tanks have suffered
from the exuberance of class soci
ety spirit, but Univeisity property
has always been held sacred.
Never have men so completely for
gotten or disregarded the obliga
tion which they are under for the
advantages which have been re
ceived— advantages which have
been given with such devotion and
self-sacrilice, it is an ingratitude
which we would have believed
could not exist in the heart of a
Stanford man, and we are ashamed
to own our error. The person or
persons who are responsible for the
outrage, whoever they are, have
disgraced themselves. They are
not such men as those who in
former years have brought honor
to the name of Stanford. The)
are unworthy of the privileges of
the University. The work was
done under cover of night by men
whose identity will not be known;
the letters painted are not the in
signia of any recognized society.
Not only was the painting the
work of vandals: it was the work of
cowa ids.
