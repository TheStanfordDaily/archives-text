Those interested in the welfare
of the Junior Quad are complain
ing that members of the class have
not yet paid up their assessments
so that the necessary deposit can
he placed with the printers. If the
money is not in the hands of the
treasurer very soon; work on the
book will have to be stopped. A
delay in the progress of the book
now will be a serious matter, as it
can be issued on time only by
steady, uninterrupted work through
the rest of the semester. The treas
urer of the class lias issued a call
fur delinquent members to pay
him tomorrow. It is to be hoped
for the reputation of the class and
of the University that this request
is heeded.
