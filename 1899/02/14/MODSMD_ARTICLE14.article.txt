Little is heard except on Al
umni Day of the Stanford Alumni
Association, but now by the an
nouncement of the coming publica
tion of a register of alumni we are
made to realize that its oflicers
have been hard at work The in
itial effort required to bring out a
register such as is planned is con
siderable, but no one can doubt
that for an alumni body number
ing over eight hundred it is worth
while. Those who as freshmen saw
the Class of ,( J5 graduate are now
themselves alumni. We have
passed the period when any con
siderable number of graduates can
be personally acquainted, and it is
time that we, .like our sister col
leges of the East, should make
some organized effort to further
acquaintance and foster loyalty to
alma mater among our gradu
ates. The formation of a branch
of the Alumni Association in San
Jose, where there are forty live
graduates, is a move in the right
direction. Much credit is due the
present set of oflicers for the energy
they have displayed, but the result
ing data are sure to be incomplete
unless they have the help of every
one interested. Let alumrii and

undergraduates all take pains to
forward to the compilers of the reg
ister at all times notes concerning
graduates for use in the initial
register or in its subsequent revis
ion.
