# Track Notes.
## 
### 
The second weekly try-out w;is
held on the track yesterday after
noon. The event was the half
mile run and there were about a
dozen starters. A good many of
the men have been suffering with
the grip and it was not thought
U'st for (hem to run the entire dis
tance with any attempt at speed.
Captain Smith set the pace and
finished tirst in very good time for
the time of the vear. Behind him

Chadbourne, '02, Barker, '02, and
Bristow Adams, '00, were fairly
well bunched, all going under 2:20.
On next Monday, if there its a
chance for steady training during
this week so that the men can get
into shape, there will be a try-out
in the quarter mile.
