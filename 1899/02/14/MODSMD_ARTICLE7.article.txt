# Harvard Report.

### 
The annual report of the presi
dent and secretary of Harvard
University contains a number of
points interesting to college stu
dents. First, by the careful main
tenance of records throughout the
year, the fallacy that good students
usually are physically weak, has
been exploded. Of the men gaining
scholarships eighty-three possessed
a satisfactory amount of strength
and vigor. In this connection it
might be stated that at Harvard
the number of students who take
more than the required work each
year is steadily on the increase.
In athletics the report states that
the evils of over-training have been
lessened. In all spotrs it was found
very desirable to develop agreeable
local competition. To quote: "The
principal benefit of athletics accrues
to the hundreds of students who
play wholesome games and take
vigorous exercise without ever being
heard of in intercollegiate contests.''
The report disapproves of severe
training of freshmen for football,
both from a physical and mental
standpoint.
