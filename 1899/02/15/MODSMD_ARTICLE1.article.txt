# DR. JORDAN'S ADDRESS.
## His Opinion of the Duty of Our Government with Regard to the Philippines. 
### 
Under the management of the
Graduate Club, Dr. Jordan last
night read his article, "The Ques
tion of the Philippines." The paper
is a sequel to his article 14 Lest We
Forget," delivered in San Francisco
last spring, which dealt particularly
with the question of Cuba.*
Following his accustomed policy,
Dr. Jordan held the extreme con
servative view. The arguments
were characteristic, full of epigram
matic force. The time was brief for
handling a question so comprehen
sive and theoretical, and in some
places its argument was forced into
Weakness because impossibility to
give in short time the accumulated
evidence in its support. The article
in its entirety will be published by
Mr. Valentine, along with " Lest
We Forget," and can then be
studied in its completeness.
The stand of Dr. Jordan was
thus expressed in his introduction,
"To prove it is to our advantage to
withdraw as sovereign from the ac
quired territory."
In preliminary statement Dr.
Jordan reviewed the beginning of
the present problem: The Philip
pines were captured by force. The
United States has no title to them
gained through any moral power.
They were wrested from Spain in
Europe, and the people whose most
intimate interests are concerned
were not parties to the transfer.
There was a money balance paid,
$20,000,000, a price that makes the
present value an apparently profit
able exchange; but when the effects
in the future are considered, the re
turn will be small. To hold the
Philippines we become an oppres
sor, as Spain before us was an
oppressor. The people under Agui
naldo are in rebellion against the
United States as before they were
in rebellion against Spain. Agui
naldo stands to the Philippines as
once Washington stood to America.
What is it our nation shall do?
" This great nation is too brave to
be cowardly."
We look to France; there are
French colonies. We look to Eng
land; there are English colonies.
To Holland, to Germany; and they
100 have colonies. Leaving aside the
question of their success, we have
the question, Do we wish to adopt
the political life of France, of Eng
land, or of any nation of Europe?
The answer is well formed in the
American mind: No. Our nation
stands, not for commerce, for the
"open door," for simple money
gain, but for morality. "Justice
is the only morality." We have
taken from Spain a power we said
she abused. We have no right to
substitute our abuses for her's, our
force for her's, our government
where it excites as strong an op
position as did her's.
There is not in the American
mind the hereditary craving for
power. It has not formed our con
stitution nor been allowed a place
in the administration of national
affairs. But in this last year we
have waked with unnatural wonder
at our resource. We have crushed
an enemy overwhelmingly, and we

see in our hands broad and far
reaching territory. There is the
flash of desire, and the public opin
ion, the press, the national leaders,
inter-dependent, are blinded in its
new passion. The real cause of this
impulse is not in influences that
are noble. We are too powerfully
attracted by a belief in commercial
gain. Then the English interests
make it English policy to keep us
in the Philippines; for with us in
the Orient, she would be more than
ever able in her skillful play of
nation against nation. So, in eager
delight at English approval, we are
hasty to institute a vulgar, par
venu imitation of English methods.
The question of constitutionality
is widely prominent in forming the
public mind. From the standpoint
of the Constitution, we must with
draw from the Philippines. It is
not alone a disavowal of the Mon
roe Doctrine, but a direct trans
gression of the original model, to
force upon a people a government
distasteful to them. This admits
no justification. The usually-cited
example of Louisiana is not a par
allel. Louisiana was contiguous,
of allied interests, of homogeneous
population. The Philippines are
none of these. Whether our rule
would be better or worse, to Amer
ican people, a people must be wil
ling.
Vet we are full of dreams. The
press speaks of imperialism, of
manifest destiny, of sacred obliga
tion, of profitable expansion. This
is simple cant to justify ourselves.
There is no destiny—"A statesman
knows no chance." Imperialism
is impossible to a democracy. We
have no obligation to be a judge
among nations. Nor would expan
sion be either sound or profitable.
Native labor is too abundant and
cheap to allow American compe
tition, and even those who would
at first gain power in industrial
leadership, would degenerate un
der the climatic influences. Be
sides, the expense of maintaining
" expansion would offset all com
mercial gains.
But leaping these barriers, and
allowing force to the fallacy of in
demnity, would retention be logi
cally possible ? We dare not
make our government a purely
scientific representation. The rude
strength of our country lies in its
sturdy interest of the majority in a
system by the people as well as for
the people. This rule must oper
ate in every section and through
every class, or the whole is corrup
ted. Therefore, the simple trade
policy is impossible. Imperialism
is impossible. Militarism is for
us, as for Europe, an ultimate
ruin. Absorption is not in nature
to be accomplished.
I'll ere is but one course open to
us in expedience and in honor.
We must deal with the Philippines
as we are dealing with Cuba. We
have crushed a rule that was op
pressive. It is our duty to follow
the motives we avowed at the be
ginning of the war with Spain —
"To establish justice, to insure
tranquility." To accomplish this,
we must give our protection and
aid in establishing a sound self
government. And then we must
withdraw.
