The Graduate Club gave last
night a pleasant demonstration of
its value in our University. The
pleasure and the benefit that comes
from listening to prominent men
on prominent subjects is enthusi
astically appreciated. But beyond
this Dr. Jordan's lecture was to the
undergraduate not only another
opportunity to feel warm admira
tion for our college president, but
a sincere sign of the interest and
loyalty of those already in the
upper ranks.
