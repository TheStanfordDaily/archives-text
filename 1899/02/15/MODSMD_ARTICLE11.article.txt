The Assembly has passed the
Exemption Bill without argument
and by an overwhelming majority.
This is only the first step in a long
fight, but the first step has been a
long stride in the right direction.
The bill is now before the Judici
ary Committee of the Senate, and
upon their reporting it to the Sen
ate that house will act upon it.
If it passes the Senate successfully,
the people of the State pass upon it
two years from now. The decisive
action of the Assembly is a pleas
ant indication of the ultimate pas
sage of the measure.
