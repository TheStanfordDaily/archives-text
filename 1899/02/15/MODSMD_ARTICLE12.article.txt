The new office which has been
created by President Jordan fol
lowing out the original plan of the
founders of the University does not
at present involve any more oner
ous duties than Dr. Branner has
been performing as Chairman of
the Committee on Ways and
Means; but the title is more digni
fied and doubtless with time the
responsibilities will increase. The
man chosen to occupy the post sec
ondary in importance only to the
presidency should be that one of
the faculty most thoroughly char
acterized by breadth and depth and
strength of character. Such is Dr.
Branner.
