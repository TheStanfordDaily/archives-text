ing for the Pennsylvania State Col

nually for the maintenance of the
library and museum to be connected

—Interest in the controversy as
to the benetit of college education
in making public men has caused
the compilation of all sorts of sta
tistics. The latest is in regard to
cabinet ofiicers since the birth of

—The result of the physical meas
urements of the present freshman
class at Yale is interesting. The
average age is 19 years, 1 month,
and 19 days; weight, 134.(3 pounds;
height, 5 feet 8.1 inches; chest 30.'£
inches; lung capacity, 205 cubic
feet. These averages are announced
as very high, and not due to a few
magnificent physiques, but to the
absence of many poor ones. The
measurements are belter than for
any previous class, and the reason,
it is claimed, is because of the in
troduction of athletics and gym
nastics into preparatory schools.
