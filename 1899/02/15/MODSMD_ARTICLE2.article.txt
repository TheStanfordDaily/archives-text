# A 						VICE-PRESIDENT.
## Dr. Branner to Fill the Newly Created Office of Vice-President of the University. 
### 
Dr. John Casper Branner, Pro
fessor of Geology and for the last
semester chairman of the Commit
tee on Ways and Means, has been
appointed vice-president of the
University. This does not signify
any radical departure in the p ilicy
of the University, as the office was
contemplated by Senator Stanford
and President Jordan when the
University was founded. At one
time Professor Swain was thought
of for the position, put he left and
is now the president of the Univer
sity of Indiana.
Hitherto the duties which will
devolve upon the vice-president
have fallen to the chairman of the
Committee on Ways and Means,
it is felt now that the University is
entering upon a period of expan
sion, and it may be necessary for
Dr. Jordan to be absent more than
in the past. Besides, as the Uni
versity grows the President will
more and more need a man upon
whom he can rely for close assist
ance and co-operation. To meet
this need President Jordan has
created the new office and selected
Dr. Branner to fill it.
