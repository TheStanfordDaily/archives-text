Harold C. Heath, formerly in
structor in Zoology here, was on the
quad today. Mr. Heath left the
University in 1897 for the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, where he took
his doctor's degree last year. He is
now at work at the Hopkins Labora
tory at Pacific Grove gathering
material for a book to be published
soon by Dr. Jordan and himself.
The work will be a text-book on
zoology suitable for high school
and college use. The manuscript
will soon be ready to place in the
hands of the publishers, Appleton
& Co. Original illustrations are
being made by W. S. Atkinson, '99,
artist of the Hopkins Laboratory.
Mr. Heath will return to the Uni
versity next year as Instructor in
Zoology.
