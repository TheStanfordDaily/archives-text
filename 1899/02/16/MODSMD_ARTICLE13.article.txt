The editor of the Junior Quad
is experiencing a great deal of difli
culty in securing material from tlie
various societies and organizations
in the University. The fact that
the Annual does not appear until
the latter part of April seems to
have led some to think that the
members of tlie staff were "rushing''
them when asking for copy at this
early date; but it must be under
stood that a great deal of work is
connected with the printing of the
Annual, besides the finishing of all
photographs and drawings, and
thus, in order to secure a good rep
resentation, these organizations
should assist the editor as much as
possible and prepare their mater
ial at once.
