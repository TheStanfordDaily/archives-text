The Stanford University Inn has
been running long enough now so
that to a good many students it
has come to seem indispensable. In
the semester that it has been in
operation it has thoroughly demon
strated that it is doing what neither
the Encina dining room nor the
various boarding houses could do.
It is generally known that Mr. John
son has been running the Inn so as

to barely cover expenses. The
quality of food furnished therefore
depends altogether upon the amount
of patronage the Inn has. If many
who have been living there leave,
the food will necessarily be poor,
if Mr. Johnson is not obliged to
give up the thing altogether. The
Inn has become a part of the Uni
versity equipment and as such every
student should take pride in it and
do all in his power to increase its
efficiency. Further, at present
twenty-six students are furnished
employment there and the number
is being increased from time to
time. Especially should Encina
students realize that the population
and success of the Hall to no small
degree depends upon the Inn.
