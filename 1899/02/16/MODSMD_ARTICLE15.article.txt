# The 						Bicycle Race in the Field-Day.
## 
### 
The first annual meeting of the
Intercollegiate Bicycle Association
will be held in New York in about
a week. At this meeting a consti
tution and by-laws will be adopted
and the preliminary arrangements
made for the championship meet
ing.
The bicycle events have taken
place apart from the Mott Haven
games for several years, but the
scores have counted in with the
total results. Last year, however,
it was deemed best by the Intercol
legiate Athletic Association to
separate the bicycle races entirely
from the other games, and have
them under the direction of differ
ent management. The meeting
which will soon take place will be
in accordance with this plan.
J.T. Williams of Columbia will
be the chairman of the committee
on organization, and will be assisted
either by 11. T. liuwles or L. Tweedy
of Yale and a representative from
Harvard.
There has been considerable dis
satisfaction here regarding the bi
cycle event in our field-day with
Berkeley. Three years ago was the
last time the race was run on the
same track with other events. Year
before last the bicycle race was
run on the Velodrome track at 1:30
just before the rest of the sports
took place. Last year it was run
in San Jose on the Wednesday be
fore tiie Saturday on which the
regular field-day was held. It is
not known what will be done this
year.
