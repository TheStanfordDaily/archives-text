# Junior Class Picture.
## 
### 
About one hundred Juniors gath
ered at the Museum building yes
terday afternoon for the purpose of
being photographed for the IUOO
Annual. The time had been well
advertised by notices in the Daily
Palo Alto and on the quad, and
this accounted for the large num
ber of persons out, something un
usual in the history of class pic
tures. The picture was taken by
Franklin of Palo Alto, who has
been doing most of the work for
the Annual. It is understood that
a few of the class remembered to
take their assessments.
