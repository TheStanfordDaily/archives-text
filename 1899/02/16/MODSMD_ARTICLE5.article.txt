The new wings to the Museum
are rapidly approaching comple
tion. The concrete work is all in
place and only interior finishing
remains. The north wing is the
farther advanced and will be ready
for occupation in a couple of weeks,
while the other will probably be
done about the first of April. They
will both be tilled with Mrs. Stan
ford's art treasures which are now
at Washington and in the Stanford
home in the city.
