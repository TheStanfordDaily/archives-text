# The 						Next "Sequoia."
## 
### 
This week's Sequoia starts out
with editorials on the Encina re
ception, and on signs of spring in
California. The first article is a
continuation of Robert W. Hart
well's " Volunteer Vanities," and
takes the reader through the period
of embarkation for Manila, with an
account of the last glimpse of the
Golden Gate. Paul Griggs writes a
good short story, "The Right Hon
orable," which will be followed next
week by "My Lord," a sketch using
the same characters. Another, and
a most ingenuous sketch, is " Where
the Shoe Pinches," by " De Q." A
skit concerning the coming Palo

Alto -Sequoia baseball game, with
'' Arcadian Echoes" and Athletics,
completes the prose of the issue. In
verse there is " In Memory," a poem
to Dr. Thoburn, written by W. J.
Neidig, '90, ex-editor of the Sequoia.
There are also verses by Leslie
Harrison, Wallace A. Irwin, and
(J. K. Binkley.
