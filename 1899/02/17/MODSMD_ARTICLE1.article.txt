# FREDERICK WARDE'S LECTURE.
## The
						Chapel Crowded to Hear the Scholarly Tragedian Interpret Shakspere. 
### 
Mr. Warde was greeted this
afternoon with a crowd that mer
ited our new assembly hall. Shak
spere was born many years ago,
but Mr. Warde found many things
to say of him. His popularity
needs no elaboration. His power
was easily noticeable in a single
glance across the faces of his aud
ience, that Hashed or lowered into
solemnity as the lecturer himself
initiated.
In taking up the real substance
of his lecture, Mr. Warde gave first
a brief outline of the life of Shak
spere. This was based tin the re
search, which critics are not able
to overthrow, of Sydney Lee, in his
new biography of Shakspere. Mr.
Warde brought out with especial
force some points to prove the log
ical fallacy of the Baconian contro
versy concerning the authenticity
of the plays in Shakspere's name.
First, there is an error in the
popular mind about the social
standing of the family of Shak
spere. His people were not of the
lower class, but of the vast middle
class, '"the yeomanry of England,
the backbone of England, the
power that is today the loins of the
American republic." The position
assured social advantages. Among
these were the schools of Stratford.
For seven years the young Shak
spere was in constant attendance
of the Charterhouse, a period of ed
ucation that is quite as much as
many other among the greatest
men of the world have had as a
basis of fame. This argument of
the Baconian sympathizers is en
tirely fallible.
Second, Shakspere received ev
erywhere in London the honors
and intimacy of the greatest men
iif the time, in literature, in states
manship. These men could not
have been deceived.
Third, the precision of the scien
tific Bacon is at wide variance
with the multi-minded carelessness
of Shakspere. Shakspere, he of
"little Latin and less Creek"; who
used worse French than a semi
nary girl; whose whole knowledge
was the sparkling, wide variety of
a man who loved living, was not
one who cared for the dim, remote
profundity of an Elizabethan sa
vant.
Fourth, Bacon was no poet. No
where in bis pages of philosophy,
of statesmanship, of ancient re
search, are found any of the simple
touches of that soul of poetry that
glows omnipresent in every page of
Shakspere.
Take these two men. Leave
aside the gathered evidence of those
deep in this controversy. Study
alone the lives of the two claim
ants, from themselves, and you
will know who wrote those plays.
Mr. Warde then gave a rein to
his enthusiastic love for the man
he has studied. Frequently he gave
a proof that showed again his
power to sweep an audience with
him. He understands the com
moner forms of popularity, but
more noticeable were his keen
asides on the nature of now and
its likeness to the nature of then.

Mr. VVarde is not an elocutionist,
but strictly an interpreter. The
art is hidden; the emotion only is
felt.
Passing from the brief study of
the life of Shakspere, Mr. Warde
told " How to study Shakspere."
"In the plays of Shakspere there
is not a chord in the whole gamut
of passion that is not touched firmly
yet delicately." There is nothing
in them that was obscure to his
time; there is nothing in them that
should be obscure to us. Nor would
there be (Mr. Warde showed here
the humerus force of the talented
advocate) if it were not for the
hordes of commentators who have
thrust a million unmeant meanings
into his simple stories. " Com
mentators â€”moles that go burrow
ing and pop uj) always in unex
pected places." Let all the com
mentators go. There is the one
way to know Shakspere: read him.
Remember that you will find al
ways simplicity and directness.
Shakspere was a player himself,
and he wrote such plays as might
be played. They were presented to
the English intelligence of his time;
they are just as capable of being
understood by the reader of today.
There is a formula for reading
Shakspere. It is in three parts.
First, read the play for the story.
You will like it. Next read the
play for the poetry. It is there,
everywhere. You say, " Ah, how
very charming, isn't it? Was that
Tennyson? Shakspere? That was
Shakspere? Ah, Shakspere was a
poet." Then last, read him for his
breadth, his depth, his soundness
through it all.
To prove what he had declared
convincing the absolute power of
Shakspere himself in interpreting
himself, Mr. Warde recited from
Hamlet's soliloquy. The words
fell clearly, with no doubt, no pause
in their meaning. '* Did you hear
that? Can you find anything in
that which shows unclear to you?"
Finally, Mr. Warde spent many
minutes in describing the typical
characters of Shakspere's plays.
He let Shakspere describe them.
There is nothing possible in print
to reproduce the pleasure of listen
ing to one after another of the
greatest scenes in fiction given in the
author's words and in words that
convey them. Portia and Rosa
lind, his women; Fa I staff, and
Bottom, " the glorious old clown."
There is no comment on Mr.
Warde that will make absence from
this afternoon's lecture a satisfac
tion.
