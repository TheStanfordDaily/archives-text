The baseball season lias opened
none too auspiciously for us. We
are not to be discouraged by the
showing our team made yesterday,
because it was severely crippled in
at least two important positions
where, moreover, we are especially
strong with our complete team in
the game. .Still we have not won
a game this year, and besides

we have been defeated l>y the same
team which lias been beaten by
Berkeley. It is no new thing
for a U. C. baseball team to
show up alarmingly superior to
our own at the beginning of a
season and yet be hum hied before
the season's close. Yet although
our team can stand defeat at this
time of the year, it is true that in
many ways conditions favor our
rivals; and the sooner we get seri
ously to work and begin to close
up on them, the better for us. The
outlook is not in any way discour
aging. Our team, as soon as it is
a little more thoroughly organized
and the players have settled down
to steady playing, will he a strong
one. Only it is time they were be
ginning to get into the form that
will win the championship for us
again this year. Tomorrow we
will probably put our strongest
nine int > the game with the Fire
man's Fund team and it would be
a good thing for the nine itself and
for our own feelings if we could
win. We very probably will if the
team is encouraged and urged to
its best by a good-sized crowd of
supporters. It is possible by a
genuine demonstration of hearty
hacking not only to increase the
number of hits in the game, but
also to decrease the list of errors.
It is worth while to make a try at
winning tomorrow.
