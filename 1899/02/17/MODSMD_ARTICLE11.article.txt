# Pennsylvania Alumni Register.
## 
### 
The following from the J'ennsyl
raniua of February 8, is interesting
in view of the decision of the Stan
ford Alumni Association to publish
an Alumni Register:
"The February number of the
' Alumni Register' appeared yester
day. It contains a biographical
sketch of Professor Ezra Ctis Ken
dall, with a portrait, and the
account of the General Alumni
Society Scholarship Foundation
contained in yesterday's issue. The
Medical Laboratories, the War
Menu rial Monument, and the South
Street M ission,are commented upon.
An elaborate table, showing by
class and department the number
of living alumni and the number
oi members of the Alumni Society
from 1820 to date, with the per
centage of members of the classes
who become members of the Society,
shows a comparatively large falling
off in the last live years. The cata
logue and the Provost's report are
reviewed. A resuin6 of the work
of the athletic teams in 18i)S and
the customary Diary Department
conclude the number."
