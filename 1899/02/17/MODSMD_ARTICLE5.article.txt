# Yesterday's Game.
## 
### 
Stanford was defeated at San
Jose yesterday in her first game
with Santa Clara by the one-sided
score of 14 to 1. The game was
decidedly uninteresting. Stanford
put up an exceedingly poor exhi
bition in all departments, due to
some extent to the absence of
Lougheed and \Vright.
Carson started in to pitch, but
proved so wild that at the end of
the fifth inning Sherer was put in.
During the time Carson was in the
box eleven men got to first tin balls,
while he allowed seven hits to be
made. Sherer held Santa Clara
down to three hits and gave three
bases on balls in the four innings
that he was pitching.
Stanford was unable to connect
with Kelley's curves, getting but
four safe hits during the game.
Outside of the playing of Strohn
the Varsity was very ragged.
Strohn made a phenomenal stop
over the second base but was un
able to complete the play in time
to put out the runner. Swindells
caught a good game, considering
the wildness of the pitchers. Ilis
throwing was better than anything

lie has done in that line for a long
time.
Santa Clara played an excellent
game, an the score shows.
One bright feature of the game
for Stanford was a triple play,
Chandler to Strohn to Swindells.
