Two years ago Frederick W'arde
lectured in our chapel. An indi
cation of how that pleasant talk
was remembered here and of the
enjoyment anticipated in ihe one
given lliis afternoon can he found
in the fact that the chapel was
tilled over an hour before Mr.
Warde was to speak. The close
attention that the speaker com
pelled for the brief hour and a half
that he talked is proof enough that
the expected pleasure was forth
coming.
