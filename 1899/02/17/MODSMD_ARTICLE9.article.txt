It is the intention of the Daily
Palo Alto to publish, as soon as
possible, a complete list of all the
Stanford men who were in the late
war. Such a list will be extremely
valuable in future years and
should be made at once, since de
lay renders the gathering of data
increasingly difficult.
So far as is known, about fifty
students, ex-students, and alumni
were enlisted, the regiments repre
sented being the Fourth and Four
teenth Regulars, the First, Seventh,
and Eighth California, the First
Colorado, the First Washington,
First Oregon, and First lowa Vol
unteers, and the Utah Artillery.
Any one knowing exactly what
Stanford men were in each of these
regiments, or having any addi
tional information, will confer a
favor by sending it to this office at
his earliest convenience.
