# VARSITY DIDN'T WIN.
## Fireman's Fund Team Again Has the Favorable Side of the Score in Baseball. 
### 
Stanford was beaten Saturday in
the game with the Fireman's Fund,
by the score of 5 to 1. Though full
of errors at times, the game was
interesting to the few persons who
attended. Lanagan, in the box
for the Varsity, pitched an excel
lent game. His control was good
and he had his usual speed. The
five hits that the visitors got were
scattered, no two happening in the
same inning. With proper fielding
support a different tale might he
related.
The Varsity has not struck a
batting gait as yet. Timely hitting
is the surest method of run getting.
Stanford got her run in the sec
ond. Young reached first on
Schmeer's error, but was forced at
second, Wright getting safe on the
play. Bentley singled, and Gran
dall followed suit. Lougheed hit
to Follansbee, who fumbled, Wright
tallying.
The Fireman's Fund scored once
in the third and again in the
fourth. The score remained two to
one until the ninth inning when
some errors, a base on balls, and a
single netted the visitors three runs.
In the last half of the ninth it
looked as if Stanford must score,
but Schmeer accepted Strohn's hot
liner, doubling Lougheed at second.
Swindells' pretty two bagger imme
diately afterward proved unavail
ing, for Murphy Hew out to Webber
The same teams meet again on
Wednesday. Washington's Birth
day. Krug and Haunnond will be
in the battery positions.
