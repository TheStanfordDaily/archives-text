# Roble Reception to Faculty.
## 
### 
Since the farce given by faculty
members at the Kirmess in the fall
of 1897 there has been nothing at
Stanford more enjoyable in that
line than "Bangs' Chafing-Dish
Party," presented at Roble last, Sat
urday evening on the occasion of
their reception to the faculty. The
stage had been erected in the din
ing room, at the entrance to which
the guests' eyes were attracted by
an imposing box office where dis
play posters set forth the excel
lencies of the actors.
The program with which the
evening began was opened by an
instrumental solo, Miss Lira Winn.
This was followed by the overture,
" Southern Belle " : mandolins,
Misses McDougald, Richards, Olco
vich; guitars, Misses Fairchild
and Swett; piano, Miss Aveiine
Phillips. The curtain then rose
for the farce, for which the cast is
given below:
Mr. Yardsley It. E. Allardice
Mr. Perkins H. It. Fairclough
Mr. Bradley H. G. Nash
Mrs. Perkins .Jessie A. Moore
Mrs. Bradley Helen Ayer
Miss Yardsley Kate Hooper
Jennie, maid Bee Shaw
With breathless interest the au
dience followed the fate of the
Welsh rarebit in the chafing dish
presided over by Professor Allar
dice as "Bob Yardsley" through
its initial melting, its subsequent
coagulation, to its tinal ossification.
At the close of the farce each of the
players was presented with a huge
bunch of violets, and after a lively
selection, march, "Victory," by the
instrumental sextette, all scattered
through the tastefully decorated
hallways and parlors. In the lat
ter place salad and sandwiches
were served, with cocoa brewed on
the spot in dialing dishes, the use
of which was most appropriate to
t e occasion. Few of the quests
had thought of departing when the
lights, dipping at eleven, reminded
them of the hour, and after these
had gone the tables were cleared
away and the lioble girls spent the
time in dance and frolic until a
late hour.
Credit is due the committee on
programs, of which Miss Belle
Kalloch was chairman, to whose
efforts the humorous play bills
with their sly hits were due; to
Mrs. Matzke, to whose efficiency as
stage manager much of the success
of the farce must be attributed; to
Miss Elizabeth Gill, who had
charge of the posters; and to Misses
Phillips, Butterfield, and Chapman,
chairmen, respectively, of the mu
sic, decoration, and refreshment
committees.
