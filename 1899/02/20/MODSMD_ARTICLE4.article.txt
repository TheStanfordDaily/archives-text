# GOEBEL ON GOETHE.
## The 						San Francisco "Wave" Commends the Professor's Recent Lecture in San Francisco. 
### 
The San Francisco Wave of last
Saturday contains a very compli
mentary notice of Professor Julius
Goebel's recent lecture 011 "Goethe"
before the German Branch of the
San Francisco Young Men's Chris
tian Association. Because of the
interest this notice has to us at the
University, we reprint it in full. It
follows:
"Professor Julius Goebel's last
lecture 011 Goethe deserved all that
the delighted audience said about
the Stanford professor's efforts. Dr.
Goebel is a fluent, easy, and grace
ful speaker. He is something else.
He is an analyst of the highest de
gree. His last lecture on "Young
Goethe" was easily the best of the
course, barring perhaps that on
Lessing, which was replete with
deep, philosophical comment, and
was really a masterpiece. "Young
Goethe" was practically a continu
ance of one of the professor's last
course on the "Masterpieces of
German Literature," that on
"Faust." The present lecture was
a biographical sketch of the great
German poet, his work, and his
time.
"Unlike most German students,
Dr. Goebel is no hero worshipper.
Goethe was not "ein vom Himmel
gefallenes Genie" (a genius fallen
from Heaven), nor was he a saint.
He was just an ordinary, but very
gifted sinner. Those who would
cover Goethe's shortcomings by for
giving great wrongs in a great poet,
are blind and weak. The poet's
license may extend to his muse, but
never to his morals. Goebel at
least would not whitewash Goethe;
but he granted that the poet early
recognized his folly, and, regener
ating, became the Titan of Ger
many, as a man and as a poet.
This tracing the life of Goethe step
by step from the time he left Frank
fort until he parted from Freda
rika, Professor Goebel unfolded a
wonderful panorama of a great
human life, using as background
and stage-setting the lyrics and the
letters of the poet. The former
showed the man, and the latter
gave fine prospective views of the
future master. Frequently Goebel
would pick up a book by some con
temporary of Goethe and compare
"das Geschwaetz" (the gibberish)
of the vapid rhymsters, with
Goethe's inimitable verse, every
line of which was clean and lofty
and of classic finish.
"The development of the poet
was naturally much quicker than
that of the man Goethe. The sub
lime genius of him saw beauty in
everything and expression followed
in that well known matchless man
ner. But being an expressionist,
his moral development was re
tarded by the same token. The
French atmosphere enveloped him
like the seductive vapor of a sense
robbing drug, and he yielded. Not
until he met Fredarika, the peasant
parson's daughter, did he awake to
the recognition of moral dignity to
himself. Hers was a superlative
beauty, joined with loftv piety. By
her side Goethe become conscious
of his own great mission. His de

votion to her was sincere, and who
knows if lie would not have mar
ried her, had the conditions been
different. But he left her in obedi
ence to his mother's call, and Fred
arika's heart was broken. Would
there were palliating circumstances
to condone this tremendous wrong.
This affair with the parson's
daughter was neither a poet's fancy,
nor the somewhat sad end of a
charming Idyll, nor yet the calcu
lated cruelty of a rogue; but a
great heart-breaking tragedy, a
tragedy which left its mark upon
Goethe's life. It is true that Goethe
went forth a changed man, great
and good, but it required the heart's
blood of Fredarika to regenerate
the man, and bring the poet to the
highest perfection.
"Goethe himself recognized
whom he had sacrificed upon the
altar of his muse; he appreciated
the vicarious atonement of Freda
rika, and he may have shed bitter
tears when he wrote his matchless
lyric:
" 'Sah ein Knab'ein Roeslin steh'n.'
"The reading of this pathetic
poem concluded Professor Goebel's
lecture. The reading was more
than artistic â€”it was awe inspiring.
"At the last line Goebel's voice
died away in a whisper; the audi
ence was hushed; the curtain had
fallen upon a great scene, and as
greatly presented."
