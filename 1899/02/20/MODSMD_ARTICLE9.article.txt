The lust number of the Occident
was more than usually (we hope)
bellicose. The first editorial of the
paper is devoted to an "effusion,
animated by spleen and disgruntle
ment," of the Calif or nian. The
last states that the Occident is led
to "infer that something is wrong
with the student body or the base
ball management." In between
these two is an editorial which has
wounded us somewhat deeply, and
which we quote not without regret
and reluctance.
After each inteicollegiate defeat
our friends of the Daily Palo
Alto neglect to send us the college
papers. This year they have taken
the opportunity which this omis
sion offers to say some very un
kind things both about our debat
ers and the judges of the last Car
not debate. In the Daily Palo
Alto of February 7, and also that
of February 8, there appear com
munications, extracts from which
will be found in the College World
department of this issue. In the
first the writer, after impugning
the fairness of the judges, suggests
an elaborate scheme for judging
debates on points. Any merit
which his suggestion may have is
thrown into discredit by the inane
proposition which follows, viz:
That inasmuch as anyone in San
Francisco is liable to be prejudiced
in favor of California, we should,
in alternate years, select judges
from San Jose, which city the
writer looks upon as the stronghold
of Stanford.
The second communication we
quote only to show what blind
partisanship can produce. The
communicator's corpuscular theory
of debating is quite interesting as
a study in psychiatry.
We pick bits only from the Col
lege World depaitment, which is
on the whole not such thrilling
reading as the editorial:
The management of the Sequoia
shows a breadth and sympathy en
tirely lacking from the Daily Palo
Alto. The former kindly permits
us to remain upon its exchange
list after Stanford has lost a con

test. Very pound and altogether
agreeable is the following from the
editorial page
after which follows the Sequoia's
editorial upon the situation after
the Carnot.
Through the kindness of a
Stanford student we have been en
abled to get copies of the Daily
Palo Alto for February 7 and 8.
Then follow quotations from the
two communications in the Daily
Palo Alto and comments upon
them.
We are a little hurt that the
Occident didn't see lit to "cut up"
our editorial, as it is in that
column that we express our own
opinions, and it is of course our
own opinions we take greatest
pleasure in defending. However,
we do agree in the main with what
the communications said, and
mildly suggest that the proposi
tions are not absolutely inane, all
of them, nor entirely psychiatric.
The part of the first that aroused
the contempt of the Occident claims
only that part of the judges should
be selected from some other locality
than .San Francisco. The Occident
has misinterpreted the section, as
may be seen by reading the orig
inal, We ourselves think that as
it stands after the Occident has
aided us in its construction,"inane"
is more applicable than as it orig
inally read. The second commun
ication as we understood it was a
suggestion that judges should not
feel themselves 100 dignified to be
influenced by the fire of young en
thusiasm. Both these communica
tions were of course the wails of
the vanquished. We would have
preferred, possibly, to accept de
feat with set faces and heroic si
lence, but our columns are always
open to expressions of opinion from
our students. The communications
were sent in and we printed them.
We admit they may have been a
little ungraceful, but we do not see
the lilness of the adjectives the Oc
cident employs.
As for the assertion that we took
"the opportunity which the omis
sion offered" —we publish the Daily
Palo Alto for Stanford students,
and while it is, in the Occident's
opinion, plausible that we timidly
speak out our mind only when we
think our words can never reach
the Occident, we humbly claim
that it is not true. We value our
contemporary's opinion, but the
knowledge that our words come be
fore it, does not greatly affect our
policy. The omission was entirely
unintentional —we do not know
whether the fact that we do not re
ceive the Occident at all is or not.
Put who is the disloyal wretch
who betrayed us and sent those
copies ?
