# CONFESSION BEFORE MEN.
## Dr. Elliott Delivers an Exceedingly Thoughtful and Helpful Sermon. 
### 
Dr. Elliott's sermon in the chapel
Sunday morning was on the sub
ject ''Confession Before Men." In
part, he spoke as follows:
14 Frankness is the highest char
acteristic of sincerity. And if to
frankness there lie added courage
and enduring quality, the noblest
t3 T pe of manhood results. Its direct
ness dissipates the murky odors of
diplomatic fencing, as the morning
sun chases away the night damp.
Its wholesome simplicity lias the
tonic effect of ozone. We like to
know where to find a man. If he
has opinions, we like to know that
he will stand for them; that whether
an ally or an opponent, he can be
counted on and allowed for with
something like mathematical ex
actness. 1 lie world despises a
dough-face; it applauds to the echo
the man who has the courage of his
convictions. When a man fails to
come out into the open we can only
explain it by the boldness of his
cause or his own pusillanimity.
Certainly we shall put no faith in
him who defends his cause or bin
convictions nly in secret. What
is any man's loyalty worth if he
dare not avow it? Are you a demo
crat, and yet ashamed to own your
creed? Then you are not a demo
crat, and democracy does well to
commit to you neither trust nor re
sponsibility. When Colonel Roose
velt's " Bound Robin" finally broke
the red-tape meshes which con
demned our soldiers to a lingering
death in Cuba, and when the War
Department published his impetu
ous appeal from Santiago, all the
political croakers in America held
up their hands in horror. A fatal
step for a politician! True, but
whether the people or the politi
cians control, whether he is politi
cally rewarded or frank
sincerity can not hurt a sincere man.
To him nothing but insincerity and
cowardice could be fatal.
" And if this quality of straight
forwardness is so important in the
general relations of life, how much
more vital is it in that matter
which touches all the inner sanctu
aries of being. What shall be said
of the religious man who hesitates,
or is ashamed, or afraid to confess
his faith? Can a man be touched
in a living way, and lie ashamed of
the touch? Ciin a man be healed,
and contain his joy? Surely con
fession is the least that can be
asked of him. Surely without this
neither intellectual nor spiritual
honesty can exist."
The speaker referred to the em
phasis laid on the eonfessiwuial by
the church, and said the manifold
expressions of this are bound up
with the life and activity of the
Christian church the world over.
''And yet," he continued, "if we
look outside the conventional
church circles and communities into
the larger social and intellectual
movements of our time, particularly
those influences and activities
which center in the universities, we
can not but be struck with the
sharp contrast in the attitude of
men toward all those confessional
activities. We have them all, but

how much less strenuous is the in
sistence. They are apathetically
employed. Speaking generally, a
strange reticence has fallen upon
the religious life. The Scripture
flavor has dropped out of conver
sion, or strikes us archaic audi
quaint in the speech of the genera
tion that is just passing away.
" There are some who regard this
state of affairs as most alarming.
It is a sign that religious life is
dying out. It marks a fatal de
generacy, a dangerous encroach
ment of the worldly life. Any for
ward movement must galvanize
these activities into life. How else
can we hope for Christian growth,
or even preservation? If family
prayers and grace before meat are
pushed aside as old-fashioned, it
the prayer meeting and the public
testimony are a burden, can dis
loyalty go further? Wherein is the
Christian life to have any mani
festation? With young people es
pecially, to whom the intellectual
awakening brings all these things
into strong relief, and who come
from homes which honor and cher
ish these old things, pain is suc
ceeded by confusion.
" In so far as this confusion and
this drying up of the fount of re
ligious expression indicate a real
lapse of ideals, a waning of noble
purpose and high endeavor, we may
well join in this mournful refrain.
But before we fall into despair, let
us give this modern, undemonstra
tive, tongue-tied, non-conforming
Christian a hearing. Is it possible
that these formal modes of confes
sion handed down from the past
are no longer the touchstones of
the religious life? Is there perhaps
a reason, not dishonorable, for the
silence and the qualm, for the lack
of Bible phrasing, for the waning
forms, for the lessening burden of
souls which made the religious
man's conversation dwell so per
sistently upon the concerns of the
other world? Is it possible that if
instead of following mournfully
these dry channels we cut down
below the surface there will be
found the strong, deep currents of
the religious flowing on with un
diminished force?"
Speaking of modern religion, Dr.
Elliott said: "Now true religious
expression must be free from com
pulsion. It must be spontaneous.
It must not be divorced from the
I real and fruitful, not a galvanic
I battery charged from without Con
fession may be aspiration; if true,
it will be expressed in modesty of
spirit. Confession may be experi
ence; if profound it will be valu
able."
Other reasons why the familiar
' forms of confession have lost their
importance were dismissed, and
then the discourse continued: "For
tunately the morbid, gloomy idea
of piety has passed away. The
religious atmosphere, so heavily
charged with miasma, has gradu
ally cleared itself. Thanks to sci
ence, thanks to the church, thanks
to the renaissance of healthy hu
man emotion, the religious life has
largely regained its robustness.
But the flavor of the old still lin-
I <zers in many of our confessional
forms. The notion that the religi
ous person, especially the clergy

man, is apart from life in the com
mon everyday aspect, that laughter
and lightness of touch are incon
sistent with the gravity of religion, j
is one hard to be rid of.
"There is no doubt also that men
have confessed to preposterous
things. No man at any time hath
seen the Father. Our knowledge
of God does not cotne through the
physical senses. There is no math
ematical formula which compre
hends him. There is no chemistry
which reveals him. He is not to
be weighed in any scales. Still
man is greater than all these facts
and forces of nature. He can see
beyond them. Something comes
to him out of the stillness. Imag
ination, faith, hope, love point to
things that transcend sense experi
ence. Vet men looking with the
eyes of the soul have not always
been able to report correctly what
they have seen. Their vision has
been partial, defective. They have
been too indolent, or too prejudiced,
or too ignorant to relate it properly
to the facts of the universe. And
so God has been reported manlike,
whimsical, arbitrary, contradictory.
He tias been said to do from im
pulse that which was really put
into the constitution of the uni
verse from the foundation of the
world."
The speaker told of the mighty
effort of Christianity to shake off
the weights of unjust criticism, and
then said: "We are not an emo
tional people. We do not wear our
hearts upon the sleeve. We are too
earnest, perhaps, to be appealed to
by the dramatic side of self-expres
sion. With Anglo-Saxon folk the
deep things of life do not readily
find expression. The vision that
conies to us, we may perhaps suc
cessfully communicate. But what
that infinite and eternal relation is,
how it sweeps in upon our lives,
how it opens to us and we to it, the
fusing of our aspirations, our long
ings, our experiences, this can only
be worked out in the quietness and
sobriety of the unselfish life.
Prophets and poets sometimes touch
these heights and depths and we
respond to the touch. But it does
not become us to engage in wanton
frolic on this holy ground. The
deepest experiences can not be
shared; they can not be talked
about. If we say much about
them, they may be real, but they
;ire not deep. They may stir our
emotions; but they are not our
lib re, not bone of bone nor sinew of
sinew."
The difliculty of the readjust
ment of Christianity with reference
I to prayer was taken up by Dr. Fl-
I liott at some length. Regarding
i over-protestation, he said: "If con
fession were always spontaneous
and sincere, then all would be well.
But what shall we think of a loy
alty that needs ostentatious procla
! ination once a week to beget confi
dence in its genuineness? The test
that goes to the very foundation of
things conies on the school-ground,
in the class-room, in the seclusion
: of your own chamber. Religion
must tell upon character. And it
is how character stands the strain
of everyday life that we look for
the real confession or denial of
Jesus Christ. Whether you are a

child of God will not be shown by
nerving yourself to bear testimony
iÂ»i meeting. Are you honest in
your class-work ? Are the helps
you avail yourself of such as give
you a deeper insight into your
work, or do they enable you to
shirk ? Let any who are puzzled
by the mysteries and clashings of
creeds and confessions try the sim
ple ground of living true, each day
for its best things. If we are fac
ing life with frank sincerity, if we
are struggling toward faithfulness
in duty, sympathy with brother
man, appreciation of loveliness, we
can no more keep Ciod out of our
lives than the bud can refuse to
flower at the bidding of sun and
dew."

death in Cuba, and when the War
Department published his impetu
ous appeal from Santiago, all the
political croakers in America held
up their hands in horror. A fatal
step for a politician! True, but
whether the people or the politi
cians control, whether he is politi
cally rewarded or frank
sincerity can not hurt a sincere man.
To him nothing but insincerity and
cowardice could be fatal.
" And if this quality of straight
forwardness is so important in the
general relations of life, how much
more vital is it in that matter
which touches all the inner sanctu
aries of being. What shall be said
of the religious man who hesitates,
or is ashamed, or afraid to confess
his faith? Can a man be touched
in a living way, and lie ashamed of
the touch? Ciin a man be healed,
and contain his joy? Surely con
fession is the least that can be
asked of him. Surely without this
neither intellectual nor spiritual
honesty can exist."
The speaker referred to the em
phasis laid on the eonfessiwuial by
the church, and said the manifold
expressions of this are bound up
with the life and activity of the
Christian church the world over.
''And yet," he continued, "if we
look outside the conventional
church circles and communities into
the larger social and intellectual
movements of our time, particularly
those influences and activities
which center in the universities, we
can not but be struck with the
sharp contrast in the attitude of
men toward all those confessional
activities. We have them all, but

how much less strenuous is the in
sistence. They are apathetically
employed. Speaking generally, a
strange reticence has fallen upon
the religious life. The Scripture
flavor has dropped out of conver
sion, or strikes us archaic audi
quaint in the speech of the genera
tion that is just passing away.
" There are some who regard this
state of affairs as most alarming.
It is a sign that religious life is
dying out. It marks a fatal de
generacy, a dangerous encroach
ment of the worldly life. Any for
ward movement must galvanize
these activities into life. How else
can we hope for Christian growth,
or even preservation? If family
prayers and grace before meat are
pushed aside as old-fashioned, it
the prayer meeting and the public
testimony are a burden, can dis
loyalty go further? Wherein is the
Christian life to have any mani
festation? With young people es
pecially, to whom the intellectual
awakening brings all these things
into strong relief, and who come
from homes which honor and cher
ish these old things, pain is suc
ceeded by confusion.
" In so far as this confusion and
this drying up of the fount of re
ligious expression indicate a real
lapse of ideals, a waning of noble
purpose and high endeavor, we may
well join in this mournful refrain.
But before we fall into despair, let
us give this modern, undemonstra
tive, tongue-tied, non-conforming
Christian a hearing. Is it possible
that these formal modes of confes
sion handed down from the past
are no longer the touchstones of
the religious life? Is there perhaps
a reason, not dishonorable, for the
silence and the qualm, for the lack
of Bible phrasing, for the waning
forms, for the lessening burden of
souls which made the religious
man's conversation dwell so per
sistently upon the concerns of the
other world? Is it possible that if
instead of following mournfully
these dry channels we cut down
below the surface there will be
found the strong, deep currents of
the religious flowing on with un
diminished force?"
Speaking of modern religion, Dr.
Elliott said: "Now true religious
expression must be free from com
pulsion. It must be spontaneous.
It must not be divorced from the
I real and fruitful, not a galvanic
I battery charged from without Con
fession may be aspiration; if true,
it will be expressed in modesty of
spirit. Confession may be experi
ence; if profound it will be valu
able."
Other reasons why the familiar
' forms of confession have lost their
importance were dismissed, and
then the discourse continued: "For
tunately the morbid, gloomy idea
of piety has passed away. The
religious atmosphere, so heavily
charged with miasma, has gradu
ally cleared itself. Thanks to sci
ence, thanks to the church, thanks
to the renaissance of healthy hu
man emotion, the religious life has
largely regained its robustness.
But the flavor of the old still lin-
I <zers in many of our confessional
forms. The notion that the religi
ous person, especially the clergy

man, is apart from life in the com
mon everyday aspect, that laughter
and lightness of touch are incon
sistent with the gravity of religion, j
is one hard to be rid of.
"There is no doubt also that men
have confessed to preposterous
things. No man at any time hath
seen the Father. Our knowledge
of God does not cotne through the
physical senses. There is no math
ematical formula which compre
hends him. There is no chemistry
which reveals him. He is not to
be weighed in any scales. Still
man is greater than all these facts
and forces of nature. He can see
beyond them. Something comes
to him out of the stillness. Imag
ination, faith, hope, love point to
things that transcend sense experi
ence. Vet men looking with the
eyes of the soul have not always
been able to report correctly what
they have seen. Their vision has
been partial, defective. They have
been too indolent, or too prejudiced,
or too ignorant to relate it properly
to the facts of the universe. And
so God has been reported manlike,
whimsical, arbitrary, contradictory.
He tias been said to do from im
pulse that which was really put
into the constitution of the uni
verse from the foundation of the
world."
The speaker told of the mighty
effort of Christianity to shake off
the weights of unjust criticism, and
then said: "We are not an emo
tional people. We do not wear our
hearts upon the sleeve. We are too
earnest, perhaps, to be appealed to
by the dramatic side of self-expres
sion. With Anglo-Saxon folk the
deep things of life do not readily
find expression. The vision that
conies to us, we may perhaps suc
cessfully communicate. But what
that infinite and eternal relation is,
how it sweeps in upon our lives,
how it opens to us and we to it, the
fusing of our aspirations, our long
ings, our experiences, this can only
be worked out in the quietness and
sobriety of the unselfish life.
Prophets and poets sometimes touch
these heights and depths and we
respond to the touch. But it does
not become us to engage in wanton
frolic on this holy ground. The
deepest experiences can not be
shared; they can not be talked
about. If we say much about
them, they may be real, but they
;ire not deep. They may stir our
emotions; but they are not our
lib re, not bone of bone nor sinew of
sinew."
The difliculty of the readjust
ment of Christianity with reference
I to prayer was taken up by Dr. Fl-
I liott at some length. Regarding
i over-protestation, he said: "If con
fession were always spontaneous
and sincere, then all would be well.
But what shall we think of a loy
alty that needs ostentatious procla
! ination once a week to beget confi
dence in its genuineness? The test
that goes to the very foundation of
things conies on the school-ground,
in the class-room, in the seclusion
: of your own chamber. Religion
must tell upon character. And it
is how character stands the strain
of everyday life that we look for
the real confession or denial of
Jesus Christ. Whether you are a

child of God will not be shown by
nerving yourself to bear testimony
iÂ»i meeting. Are you honest in
your class-work ? Are the helps
you avail yourself of such as give
you a deeper insight into your
work, or do they enable you to
shirk ? Let any who are puzzled
by the mysteries and clashings of
creeds and confessions try the sim
ple ground of living true, each day
for its best things. If we are fac
ing life with frank sincerity, if we
are struggling toward faithfulness
in duty, sympathy with brother
man, appreciation of loveliness, we
can no more keep Ciod out of our
lives than the bud can refuse to
flower at the bidding of sun and
dew."
Dr. Elliott's sermon in the chapel
Sunday morning was on the sub
ject ''Confession Before Men." In
part, he spoke as follows:
14 Frankness is the highest char
acteristic of sincerity. And if to
frankness there lie added courage
and enduring quality, the noblest
t3 T pe of manhood results. Its direct
ness dissipates the murky odors of
diplomatic fencing, as the morning
sun chases away the night damp.
Its wholesome simplicity lias the
tonic effect of ozone. We like to
know where to find a man. If he
has opinions, we like to know that
he will stand for them; that whether
an ally or an opponent, he can be
counted on and allowed for with
something like mathematical ex
actness. 1 lie world despises a
dough-face; it applauds to the echo
the man who has the courage of his
convictions. When a man fails to
come out into the open we can only
explain it by the boldness of his
cause or his own pusillanimity.
Certainly we shall put no faith in
him who defends his cause or bin
convictions nly in secret. What
is any man's loyalty worth if he
dare not avow it? Are you a demo
crat, and yet ashamed to own your
creed? Then you are not a demo
crat, and democracy does well to
commit to you neither trust nor re
sponsibility. When Colonel Roose
velt's " Bound Robin" finally broke
the red-tape meshes which con
demned our soldiers to a lingering
death in Cuba, and when the War
Department published his impetu
ous appeal from Santiago, all the
political croakers in America held
up their hands in horror. A fatal
