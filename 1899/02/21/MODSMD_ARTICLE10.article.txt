On tomorrow there will be an
all-day, continuous performance,
baseball carnival. Nobody is par
ticularly urged to attend the jour
nalistic farce in the morning. We
desire the attendance to be entirely
voluntary and we have even placed
a slight bar to overcrowding of the
stand by making it necessary to
purchase places therein at the
nominal price of ten cents each.
We would like to see the bleachers
filled, both for the gratification of
our pride and because of the Train
ing-House Fund. The cause is
worthy and the entertainment will
be worth more than the cost. But
we do not claim that it is a matter
of any considerable importance
whether many go or not. Spec
tators will get more fun there than

j they can anywhere else and will
also help to swell the fund.
But as for the afternoon game
between the Varsity and the Fire
man's Fund, there is no such op
tion left to any Stanford student
who cares a particle for the athletic
interests of the college. The sit
uation is undeniably serious. If
we do not improve we must lose the
series to Berkeley this year. The
biggest factor in developing a team
is constant, enthusiastic support.
We have heard all this before; but
it is none the less true. If we are
going to win this year we must be
behind and with our team unfail
ingly from now to the end. To
morrow there must be a crowd in
the stand, filling it —and yelling.
