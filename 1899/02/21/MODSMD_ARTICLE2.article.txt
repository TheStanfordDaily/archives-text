# "Sequoia"-"Palo Alto" Baseball.
## 
### 
The only two purely literary
teams will cross bats on the Stan
ford campus tomorrow morning at
( J:3O o'clock. Gregory and Captain
Smith will he in the points for the
Daily, while Adams and Yost will
(ill similar positions for the
"w.eakly."
The Palo Alto team at present is
the favorite in the betting, although
the Sequoia will give them a tight
race for supremacy. The Sequoia
claims a great find in Yost, the
Encina " phenom." His hatting
is heavy; he has serpentine curves,
and speed to incinerate. Umpires
and scorers have been hired by the
day, and a great game may be
looked for. Game called at 9:30; a
pittance of one dime will be charged
to go toward the Training-House
Fund.
