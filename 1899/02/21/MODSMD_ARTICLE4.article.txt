## 
### 
The Junior Farce Committee,
composed of Miss Helen Holmes,
W. A. Irwin, Bristow Adams, .1. S.
Briscoe and F. B. Riley (chairman),
is taking active measures to secure
an original, suitable farce for pres
entation on .) unior Day.
At a meeting Friday afternoon
it was agreed to offer a prize of $15
for the best farce submitted before
March 5, provided the best was
found acceptable.
It is desired by the committee
that all those who are writing, or
who intend to write, should notify
the chairman of the committee as
soon as possible, in order that the
class may know whether to expect
a suitable farce, or whether at once
to prepare some other form of en
tertainment.
