We have been told that the
Daily Palo Alto lost yesterday's
game not through the strength of
the Seqiioia team, hut through our
own weakness. We may have been
weak, but we played the entire
game through with nine men,
while it was noticeable that men
were substituted on the other team.
We would also mention the atti
tude of the umpire. It is known
that that gentleman greatly desired
to play on the Sequoia team and
while his name did not appear in
the batting list, it seems to us he
satisfied bis ambition. The Daily
I'alo Alto team, at the time that
Boyd retired, was playing stronger
than at anv previous stage of the
game, and with the new pitcher in

the box and two men on bases in
the last half of the last inning was
about to even the score prepara
tory to winning the game, when a
rankly unjust decision of Umpire
Kickert put an untimely end to the
contest. No baseball experts up
hold Fickert in his decision. In
deed, he himself changed his mind
but lnid not the courage of his hon
est convictions, and as the score
now stands we were defeated.
