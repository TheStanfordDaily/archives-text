# "Sequoia Palo Alto" Baseball.
## 
### 
The game of baseball between
llie teams representing the staff of
the I)ailv I'alo Alto and Sequoia
was interesting to the players and
the few spectators who were pres
ent. For an amateur game the
errors were few. (Jregory was in
the box for the Daily I'ai.o Ai.to
and Royd for the Sequoia. In the
fifth inning Royd retired and Cap
tain Adams tilled his position.

Charles M. Fickert, '98, was um
pire, and it was noticeable that
Captain Smith objected to more of
his decisions than did Captain
Adams, who had evidently made
objections on his part unnecessary
before the game was called. The
linal score was 9 to 0 in favor of
the Sequoia.
