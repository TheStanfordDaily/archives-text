# AGAINST EXPANSION.
## John J. Valentine Lectures in the Chapel, Strongly Opposing Imperialism. 
### 
Mr. Valentine, on Tuesday even
ing, studied Dutch colonization in
Malaysia with especial reference to
the present question of the Philip
pines. The president of the Wells,
Kargo Express Company claims to
be simply a business man with no
title iti political science. In sup
port of his venture into this dis
cussion he quoted Chamberlain:
"A country that leaves its politics
to politicians might as well leave
the defenses of its frontier to
aliens." The address was tilled
with an entertaining variety of per
sonal experience, of current re
search, and of apt quotation. In
frequent asides was shown the
strongest feature of Mr. Valentine's
style as a public speaker, the spon
taneous humor of his comment.
The argument was vigorously
anti-expansionist, and dealt with
the simple question of retention,
with no discussion oi the means of
withdrawal.
in the lirsl place Mr. Valentine
corrected the common use of the
term "colony." There are no col
onies in Malaysia. There are only
military posts, with the natives
forced into work for the commer
cial development of the islands.
Java is the best example of colon
ial administration in the Pacific
tropics. It has a population of
24,000,1)00 on an area the size of
the American State of New York;
the administration is a strict bu
reaucracy, with a civil force costing
$160,000 yearly, and a military es
tablishment, largely oi natives, of
80,000. The injustices of the gov
eminent towards the natives are
the injustices of an empire that en
deavors to rule with might; that
holds its prosperity to be depend
ent upon the ignorance of its sub
jects. There were instances given
m proof of this. The Javanese
planter is forced to pay excessive
taxes. The Javanese laborer is on
the level with the chain-gang. Ke
dress through legal procedure is
almost impossible to a native. The
methods of punishment are prim
itive and cruel. Religious freedom
is arbitrarily curtailed. Intellect
ual development is but meagrely
provided for; 201 primary schools
have already so far roused the
common energies and independ
ence as lately to have called for
the protest from the Planters' Com
mission, "Natives refuse longer to
be driven."
Briefly reviewing the minor col
onics of the Dutch in Malaysia,
Mr. Valentine drew the lesson of
Java hard upon the question of
the Philippines. Assuming that
the methods of the American gov
ernment would In' those used by
the Dutch, he exposed through j
humor, argument, and invective,
the complete immorality of such ;
rule. "Such colonization of the j
Philippines is morally impossible."
The colonization of the Philip
pities is socially impossible, be- j
cause of the mortality among
whites in that climate. Statistics
taken by the Dutch in one of their
colonies showed a mortality of six
ty-six per cent, among colonists'

three years out. Retention by oc
cupation is not to be accomplished.
Politically, militarism and the
subservience of a people is com
pletely against the principles of our
government. Economically, the
holding of the islands has no justi
fication. For the cheapness of na
tive labor closes the door to the
surplus labor of America; Nor
are the trade interests sufficient to
warrant the expense of the machin
ery of retention. Our commerce
with the islands while under Span
ish dictation amounted to but one
one-hundredth of one per cent, of
our annual exchange. There is
apparent the complete irrationality
of a navy supported solely to pro
tect this fraction of Philippine
commerce.
Then turning from the speech
more purely argumentative and
expository, Mr. Valentine urged
the abandoning of the bubble glory
of expansion and the return to the
development of home industries.
Instead of the adjustment of the
Philippines, lake up and right the
injustice to the American Indian.
Instead of training the Filipino
to citizenship, redouble the effort to
develop the American negro.
Reverting to the principles of
America in undertaking the eman
cipation of the Cubans, Mr. Valen
tine forcefully and even bitterly
denounced the national policy oi
today. When we began, it was
altruism; when we ended it was
grand larceny. Or. Parkhurst in
his New York correspondence says:
'The American people have become
liars. Their representatives in the
House and in the {Senate are liars.
Their President is a liar.' And,"
added Mr. Valentine, " 1 am not
ready to say that 1 have a different
opinion."
Concluding, the speaker appealed
once more to the American spirit.
'"It Americans of today are not de
generate sons of illustrious fathers;
if they hold high in their honor the
history of Independence Hall and
Valley Forge, they will not now
allow their Hag to become a symbol
of brute force, but an emblem of
liberty and light."
