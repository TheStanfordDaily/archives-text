The Stanford Che!»sClul> is meet
ing for practice regularly on every
Tuesday evening at the home of
Professor Richardson. Enough
[•layers for six or seven tables are
on hand at each meeting, and con
sequently we have some prospects
for the comi ug intercollegiate match
with Berkeley. This will probably
take place in San Francisco in
April on the day of the Intercol
legiate debate and field-day, al
though Berkeley has not yet as
sented to such time.
The Stanford team is badly
handicapped by not being able to
arrange for any matches with out
side teams. Berkeley has games
arranged with the San Francisco
Chess Club and other organiza
tions.

Stanford club are: A.J. Van Kaath

Arnold, '99, Earle Veuve, '99, and
