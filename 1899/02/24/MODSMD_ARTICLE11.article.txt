# To Buy Stevenson's Works.
## 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon a ''Steven
son Tea" is to be given at the home
of Mrs. Branner for the benefit of
the Palo Alto Public Library. A
series of these teas have been given,
the last one, a "Shakspere Tea,"
being very interesting. All have
been under the auspices of the
Woman's Club of Palo Alto, and
they have been to more trouble in
arranging the program for the
"iStevenson Tea" than for any of
the others.
The money gained from each tea
is devoted to the purchase of a com
plete edition of the author whose
works are read from in the after
noon's program. The set of Steven
son, which the Woman's Club de
sires to purchase, is particularly
expensive, so that they hope for a
large attendance.
Tomorrow Mrs. Jordan will read
selections from Stevenson's works.
The Girls' Glee Club will sing, and
several of Stevenson's songs will be
sung also as solos. One of the
songs will be sung by several of the
children living on the campus.
An illuminated card with a pic
ture of the Stevenson monument in
Portsmouth Square in San Fran
cisco and the inscription which is
chiseled in it will be on sale at ten
cents.
The admission is ten cents.
