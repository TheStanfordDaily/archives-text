There is danger that the Varsity
game on the campus tomorrow will
not be well attended owing to the
short time left after the change to
advertise the fact that the game
will take place on the home
grounds and not in San Jose as
was at first announced. It is more
than ever incumbent upon those
who will be on the campus tomor
row to attend the game so that our
men may have as good backing
as possible under the circumstances.
