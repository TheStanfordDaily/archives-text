The Class of 1901 has failed to
live up to its precedent of last year,
when it conducted the first Fresh
man Glee without financial loss in
the history of the University. A
deficit of about seventy dollars now
faces the class as a result of the
small attendance at the Cotillion
Tuesday evening. The situation
is serious, when one considers the
great difficulty of realizing upon
class assessments, and especially

so, since before many months 1901
will no doubt, begin to raise funds
for the publication of its Annual.
Some very active financiering is
demanded.
