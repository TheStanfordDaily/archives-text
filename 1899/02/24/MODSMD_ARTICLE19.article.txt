It seems that not a few people
understand what we said of the
umpire's decisions in the Sc<juoia-
Palo Alto game as a serious ex
pression of dissatisfaction. In ar
ranging the game the editors of the
two papers had only two objects in
view: the fun of playing and the
possibility of adding to the Train
ing* House Fund. We had our fun
and will turn over about four dol
lars when all expenses are paid.
The editor of the Daily Palo Alto
did not regard the game of suf
ficient importance to call forth as
an earnest protest what he printed
in last night's paper. But for the
benetit of those who took us at our
word we say in actual seriousness
now that we were fairly beaten,
and that umpire Fickert's decisions
were, in our opinion, entirely un
prejudiced. And we apologize to
Mr. Fickert for whatever discom
fort our words have brought him.
