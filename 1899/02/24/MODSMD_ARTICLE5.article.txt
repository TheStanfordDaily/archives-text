# Track Notes.
## 
### 
The quarter-mile try-out, which
was announced for last Monday,
was postponed on account of the
condition of the track, which was
so hard and uneven that it was
not thought safe to put the men
through even a comparatively easy
race. Since then the track has
been put into better shape, and al
though it is not yet in a satisfac
tory condition, the try-out will
take place on next Monday. A
large number of men have already
signified their intention of com
peting.
Last Saturday Manager Culver

and Captain Smith met represen
tatives from U. C. in the city to
consider the advisability of the two
universities meeting Pomona Col
lege. Pomona has a strong team
and wants to come north and meet
the two universities on separate
days toward the end of March.
The matter was not definitely de
cided at that meeting, but since
then it has been found impossible,
principally on account of the ex
pense for us to meet Pomona.
It is almost certain that the dual
meet between the two lower classes
will not take place. In the place
of this there will probably be
a scratch University field-day in
which representatives from all four
undergraduate classes will contest.
I'laces will probably count: first,
five points, second three, third two,
and fourth one. The plan is for
each class to elect a track captain.
These captains will have super
vision of men trying for the class
teams and will act as lieutenants
under the Varsity captain.
The Athletic Committee held a
meeting last Thursday at which a
committee was elected to meet the
U. C. delegates in the annual con
ference for the consideration and
revision of the intercollegiate agree
ment. The two committees were
to come together on Saturday even
ing, but as the Stanford delegation
can not conveniently be there at the
hour appointed, it is probable that
the date will be changed. Man
ager Culver and Freshman Man
ager Bancroft are endeavoring to
arrange meets for the Freshman
Class with the Lowell High School
and with the Oakland High School.
