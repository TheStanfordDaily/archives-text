the Castilleja team, with whom
they have heen playing practice

yesterday from the team of the
University of Nevada at lie no. The
proposition «>f a match game with
lleno is looked upon with general
favor by the girls, although no

event of a game the Nevada team
would have this advantage, that
the}' have had a Stanford coach.
Miss Ada Kdwards, formerly an
assistant in the Roble gymnasium,
has been with them a month, and
will probably remain there until
