# TO CHOOSE THE TEAM.
## The
						Three Best Men Will be Selected From Eleven Candidates Tomorrow Night. 
### 
At 7 o'clock sharp, tomorrow
evening the Intercollegiate finals
will begin in the chapel. Eleven
speakers will contest in the two
debates, and from this number
three men and one alternate will
be chosen to represent us against
Berkeley next April. Each de
bater is allowed twelve minutes,
except the two affirmative leaders,
who have eleven minutes in their
opening speeches and three min
utes for closing rebuttal. Dr.
Howard, Professor R. L. (ireen,
and Judge Lindley have consented
to act as judges, and Professor
Lathrop will preside.
These debates will be on an In
tercollegiate plane. Messrs. Suz
zallo, Hayden, and Springer, our
Carnot team, and Mr. Ferguson of
last year's Intercollegiate, are en
titled to enter by virtue of having
before made a Varsity team; the
other seven were selected from a
series of preliminary contests in
which more than thirty candidates
took part. Eight were chosen
from these preliminaries, but Miss
Eraser, who was to be one of the
affirmative speakers of the second
debate, recently withdrew.
The tirst debate will be on the
question, " Resolved, That the
United States should annex the
Philippine Islands," and the de
baters will speak in the following
order: first affirmative, Charles
Quayle, '00; first negative, James
Ferguson, '99; second affirmative,
A. C. Whitaker, '99; second nega
tive, A. 11. Suzzallo, '99; third
affirmative, Duncan Mackinnon,
'99; third negative, J. F. English,
'01; and closing rebuttal by Mr.
Quayle.
The question for the second de
bate is, "liesolved, That it was un
wise to grant suffrage to the
Negro": first affirmative, William
Edlin, '02; first negative, Carl T.
Hayden, '00; second negative, R.
E. Filcher, '99; second affirmative,
Frank J. Cummings, '01; third
affirmative, J. E. Springer, '00; and
closing rebuttal by Mr. Edlin.
There will, no doubt,, be a large
audience, and it is requested that
every one come promptly. It is
especially necessary that nobody
enter the chapel while a debater is
speaking.
