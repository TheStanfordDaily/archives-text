.). JO. Springer, 'UO, A. 11. Suz
zallo, '99, and James Ferguson, '99,
with Carl T. Hayden, '00, as alter
nate, compose our Intercollegiate
debating team. A good sized aud
ience, but not so large as should
have been expected, occupied the
chapel Friday evening to hear the
final try-out. At the close of the
debates Professor Lathrop, chair
man of the evening, congratulated
the students upon a system that
could develop such debaters as the
men who had just spoken. After a
brief session, Judge Lindley an
nounced that the judges had
unanimously decided upon the
above named team. The first
three men chosen are members of
Euphronia Literary Society, while
Mr. Hayden comes from Philolex
ian.
Upon the question, "Resolved,
That the United States should an
nex the Philippine Islands," Mr.
Quayle lead the affirmative. He
advocated the incorporation of the
archipelago into our national do
main, as we have already done no
less than seven times with foreign
territory. We owe it to the natives
to establish a stable government,
and the step is necessary for us to
secure control of the commercial
prize of the age, the Pacific. Mr.
Quayle's three minute rebuttal was
a forcible summing up of the de
bate.
Mr. Ferguson opened for the
negative by showing that, contrary
to our previous acquisitions, these
islands are not contiguous to the'
United States, that they lie in the
tropics, that they are densely pop
ulated, and that annexation would
entail vast expense for little return.
Our commerce is now large with
the outside world because we have
attended to our home affairs and
created low price-lists. The gov
ernment of the Philippines would
tend to distract attention from our
much more important domestic
problems.
Mr. Whitaker continued for the
affirmative. By the fortunes of
war and the ratification of the
Treat}' of Peace, we have assumed,
both to the Filipinos and the
world at large, the duty of estab
lishing a stable government in the
islands. They are incapable of
self-government and therefore
must have one imposed upon them
from without. The argument by
the negative that corruption in the
Civil Service would result from an
nexation will not hold ; our people
are sound themselves, and the in
creased popular vigilance, which
would follow the added responsi
bility of government, would insure
proper protection.
Mr. Suzzallo, for the negative, ar
gued that if these islands are an
nexed, we must take them either
with a view to making them States,
or must govern them as colonies
and their inhabitants as a subject
race. The first method would de
stroy our unity; the second would
undermine the principles of the lie
public. There is no reason for us
to shoulder an additional burden
in the government of this -territory;

we have no department of govern
i ment lilted to deal with outlying
territory. Commerce will not fol
! low the flag, but the law of supply
j and demand ; the expense of an
i nexation will vastly exceed the
| commercial returns. We can not
develop the tropics : it would de
mand contract and .slave labor, the
mortality is extremely large, and
there is no pressure of population
in the United States.
Mr. Mackinnon claimed that we
had already assumed the responsi
bility of governing the Philippines.
In the archipelago there is no
united race, no central govern
ment. The natives are incapable
and divided among themselves.
Mackinnon has been ill for more
than a week and was so far from
well that he was unable to com
plete his speech.
Mr. English, in closing for the
negative, insisted that the burden
of proof rested upon the affirma
tive, and asked whether the United
States could afford t> turn aside
troin being a great social power
to become a great imperial power.
The United States is now socially
stable, but this is liable to be over
turned by the contemplated step.
The conservatism of the American
people will not yield to the cries
for annexation, which would dis
tract the efforts of statesmen from
the upbuilding of American citizen
ship to problems outside our boun
daries. We do not want a people
incapable of appreciating what
citizenship means under our sov
ereignty, nor can we afford to in
crease our burden of taxation.
The question of the second de
bate was, " Resolved, That it was
unwise to grant suffrage to the ne
gro." In opening, Mr. Edlin said
that the sole purpose of the Fif
teenth Amendment was to give suf
frage to the negro, considered but a
short time before as merely a piece
of property. Suffrage is not essen
tial to freedom, but is rather a
privilege granted to enlightened
free men, and is dangerous in the
hands of the unqualified. The
negro was of an inferior race, just
emerged from slavery, and unfit
for the right to vote; he became
simply a tool in the hands of po
litical corruptionists. Mr. Edlin's
closing rebuttal was strong.
Mr. Hayden insisted that the
grant of suffrage was in accordance
with the principle of equality es
tablished by our forefathers, and
had to be made in order to make
consistent this principle. The ne
gro must have a voice in the laws
he is compelled to obey ; the only
way to make him a man was to
grant him suffrage. The scatter
ing of the negro and immigration
of the whites to the South is fast
settling the race problem.
Mr. Kilcher, continuing for the
negative, contended that through
the exercise of suffrage alone could
the negro secure the necessary de
velopment. Before he received suf
frage, the Southern States had leg
islated him back into virtual slav
ery ; in order to make good the
nation's pledge to the black man
and eradicate the last vestige of
slavery, he was given the ballot as
a weapon of self-defense.
Mr. (Jummings, on the affirma

tive, ciaimed that the right to vote
is not inherent, as shown by re
quirments of age and sex. Instead
of spreading, the negroes are con
gesting in the South where the cli
mate is most congenial for their
race. They have made wonderful
progress not because of suffrage,
but of white rule.
Mr. Springer, closing for the
negative, said that suffrage was
wise because it was right, because
it was necessary, and because
of its results. It gave the Federal
government valuable aid in recon
struction, and enabled the negro
to protect himself â€”it raised him to
a higher level and fitted him bet
ter for citizenship.

litical corruptionists. Mr. Edlin's
closing rebuttal was strong.
Mr. Hayden insisted that the
grant of suffrage was in accordance
with the principle of equality es
tablished by our forefathers, and
had to be made in order to make
consistent this principle. The ne
gro must have a voice in the laws
he is compelled to obey ; the only
way to make him a man was to
grant him suffrage. The scatter
ing of the negro and immigration
of the whites to the South is fast
settling the race problem.
Mr. Kilcher, continuing for the
negative, contended that through
the exercise of suffrage alone could
the negro secure the necessary de
velopment. Before he received suf
frage, the Southern States had leg
islated him back into virtual slav
ery ; in order to make good the
nation's pledge to the black man
and eradicate the last vestige of
slavery, he was given the ballot as
a weapon of self-defense.
Mr. (Jummings, on the affirma

tive, ciaimed that the right to vote
is not inherent, as shown by re
quirments of age and sex. Instead
of spreading, the negroes are con
gesting in the South where the cli
mate is most congenial for their
race. They have made wonderful
progress not because of suffrage,
but of white rule.
Mr. Springer, closing for the
negative, said that suffrage was
wise because it was right, because
it was necessary, and because
of its results. It gave the Federal
government valuable aid in recon
struction, and enabled the negro
to protect himself â€”it raised him to
a higher level and fitted him bet
ter for citizenship.
.). JO. Springer, 'UO, A. 11. Suz
zallo, '99, and James Ferguson, '99,
with Carl T. Hayden, '00, as alter
nate, compose our Intercollegiate
debating team. A good sized aud
ience, but not so large as should
have been expected, occupied the
chapel Friday evening to hear the
final try-out. At the close of the
debates Professor Lathrop, chair
man of the evening, congratulated
the students upon a system that
could develop such debaters as the
men who had just spoken. After a
brief session, Judge Lindley an
nounced that the judges had
unanimously decided upon the
above named team. The first
three men chosen are members of
Euphronia Literary Society, while
Mr. Hayden comes from Philolex
ian.
Upon the question, "Resolved,
That the United States should an
nex the Philippine Islands," Mr.
Quayle lead the affirmative. He
advocated the incorporation of the
archipelago into our national do
main, as we have already done no
less than seven times with foreign
territory. We owe it to the natives
to establish a stable government,
and the step is necessary for us to
secure control of the commercial
prize of the age, the Pacific. Mr.
Quayle's three minute rebuttal was
a forcible summing up of the de
bate.
Mr. Ferguson opened for the
negative by showing that, contrary
to our previous acquisitions, these
islands are not contiguous to the'
United States, that they lie in the
tropics, that they are densely pop
ulated, and that annexation would
entail vast expense for little return.
Our commerce is now large with
the outside world because we have
attended to our home affairs and
created low price-lists. The gov
ernment of the Philippines would
tend to distract attention from our
much more important domestic
problems.
Mr. Whitaker continued for the
affirmative. By the fortunes of
war and the ratification of the
Treat}' of Peace, we have assumed,
both to the Filipinos and the
world at large, the duty of estab
lishing a stable government in the
islands. They are incapable of
self-government and therefore
must have one imposed upon them
from without. The argument by
the negative that corruption in the
Civil Service would result from an
nexation will not hold ; our people
are sound themselves, and the in
creased popular vigilance, which
would follow the added responsi
bility of government, would insure
proper protection.
Mr. Suzzallo, for the negative, ar
gued that if these islands are an
nexed, we must take them either
with a view to making them States,
or must govern them as colonies
and their inhabitants as a subject
race. The first method would de
stroy our unity; the second would
undermine the principles of the lie
public. There is no reason for us
to shoulder an additional burden
in the government of this -territory;

we have no department of govern
i ment lilted to deal with outlying
territory. Commerce will not fol
! low the flag, but the law of supply
j and demand ; the expense of an
i nexation will vastly exceed the
| commercial returns. We can not
develop the tropics : it would de
mand contract and .slave labor, the
mortality is extremely large, and
there is no pressure of population
in the United States.
Mr. Mackinnon claimed that we
had already assumed the responsi
bility of governing the Philippines.
In the archipelago there is no
united race, no central govern
ment. The natives are incapable
and divided among themselves.
Mackinnon has been ill for more
than a week and was so far from
well that he was unable to com
plete his speech.
Mr. English, in closing for the
negative, insisted that the burden
of proof rested upon the affirma
tive, and asked whether the United
States could afford t> turn aside
troin being a great social power
to become a great imperial power.
The United States is now socially
stable, but this is liable to be over
turned by the contemplated step.
The conservatism of the American
people will not yield to the cries
for annexation, which would dis
tract the efforts of statesmen from
the upbuilding of American citizen
ship to problems outside our boun
daries. We do not want a people
incapable of appreciating what
citizenship means under our sov
ereignty, nor can we afford to in
crease our burden of taxation.
The question of the second de
bate was, " Resolved, That it was
unwise to grant suffrage to the ne
gro." In opening, Mr. Edlin said
that the sole purpose of the Fif
teenth Amendment was to give suf
frage to the negro, considered but a
short time before as merely a piece
of property. Suffrage is not essen
tial to freedom, but is rather a
privilege granted to enlightened
free men, and is dangerous in the
hands of the unqualified. The
negro was of an inferior race, just
emerged from slavery, and unfit
for the right to vote; he became
simply a tool in the hands of po
litical corruptionists. Mr. Edlin's
closing rebuttal was strong.
Mr. Hayden insisted that the
grant of suffrage was in accordance
with the principle of equality es
tablished by our forefathers, and
had to be made in order to make
consistent this principle. The ne
gro must have a voice in the laws
he is compelled to obey ; the only
way to make him a man was to
grant him suffrage. The scatter
ing of the negro and immigration
of the whites to the South is fast
settling the race problem.
Mr. Kilcher, continuing for the
negative, contended that through
the exercise of suffrage alone could

velopment. Before he received suf

islated him back into virtual slav

and eradicate the last vestige of
