Professor Edwards, Reno Hutch
inson, and Baseball Manager Eck
art of the University of California,
and Professor Angel 1, Forrest
Fisher, and E. W. Smith of Stan
ford, delegates from the respective
athletic committees of the.two uni
versities, met in San Francisco on
Saturday afternoon to overlook
and make any necessary changes
in the existing agreement which
goes out of effect at the end of this
year.
Several points were considered,
but no very important changes
were made. The two faculty ath
letic committees had at a previous
meeting made several interpreta
tions for their own guidance as
courts of appeal when the student
managers fail to agree. These sug
gestions were approved and some
incorporated in the agreement.
Among other recommendations, the
faculty committees strongly urged
that all ungentlemanly hooting
and joshing calculated to ''rattle"
players at baseball games be dis
continued by the students of the
two universities. Some attempt
was also made to determine what
qualifications are necessary in
'•limited" students at U. C. and
"partial" students at Stanford, so
that ilie two may enter athletic
contests upon equal terms.
The most important change
made was the exclusion of the bi
cycle race from the annual track
and tield sports, following the lead
of Eastern universities. For two
years the bicycle race has been held
on a separate track, and it was,
therefore, thought best to omit it
altogether this year. Nothing was
done about substituting another
event.
It was decided to send Mayor
Phelan a vote of thanks for the
Statue of an Athlete by Tilden,
which Mayor Phelan has offered as
a prize to the university first win
ning threw annual football games
beginning with last Thanksgiving.
