Saturday's game is encouraging.
The nine played belter than it has
in any previous game this season;
they fielded cleanly and against
two strong pitchers batted surpris
ingly well. In other words, the
awakening and steadying down to
telling work that we knew was
coining has come sooner than we,
taking former years as precedent,
had hoped for. If the rest of the
college will continue the sort of in
terest in the team's prospects that
it so clearly displayed on Saturday,
there is no danger of a relapse on
the part of the players.
