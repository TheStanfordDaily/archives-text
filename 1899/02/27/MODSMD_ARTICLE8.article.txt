Our Intercollegiate debaters have
been chosen and the team that will
meet Berkeley's best speakers is
recognized by us all as tlie strongest
in college and perfectly able to cope
with any three that U. C.can pick.
Each member has already repre
sented us in an intercollegiate con
test and has given proof of his
ability. We can look forward to
the contest with the University of
California, then, without misgiv
ings. But the most encouraging
thing about the whole affair is that
the men who have been chosen had
to make a hard fight to secure their
places. They are our strongest
men, but they did not stand out
alone with a long gap between
them and their closest competitors.
All the men who spoke Saturday
night are strong debaters. That is,
wo no longer have only a few iso
lated forensic stars, but interest
and ability is distributed through
out the student body and our hopes
for the future rest upon a solid
basis.
