# '01 TRIUMPHS OVER '99.
## The 						Seniors Lose a Close and Exciting Game in the Tenth Inning. 
### 
After ten exciting innings of
baseball the Sophomores triumphed
over the Seniors yesterday by a
score of 11 to 9. Though full of
errors the game was close and in
teresting. For a time it looked as
though '01 would win without any
trouble, but '91) kept Greenebaum
chained in the vicinity of the sec
ond and began to play ball. For
the remainder of the game the rival
''rooters" gave forth their slogans
to the accompaniment of good base
ball.
Burmister, who pitched for '01,
was somewhat wild. He gave way to
Bennett in the sixth, who did good
work in holding down the batters
of the Senior team. Crandall
pitched an excellent game consid
ering his inexperience in the bat
tery position. Until the last three
innings he was pitching varsity
ball. Ue fielded his position in
good style.
Gregory played the star game for
the upper-class men. lie accepted
twelve chances all over the i n tie Id
with but one error. In batting he
rapped out a single and a timely
three-bagger.
Young, of course, got the best
batting record for the Seniors. His
fielding game was also good.
For the Sophomores, Symonds
excelled at stick-work with Beckley
a close second. Both were able to
hit the ball hard at the right time.
Symonds knocked a clean home
run with one man on bases. Beck
ley made two long hits.
Wilson played a good game after
the tirst inning. Swindells caught
well and put out a good number of
base runners at second.
The game was one of the best
class contests ever played on the
campus diamond.
