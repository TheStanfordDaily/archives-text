Professor Lathrop as chairman
at the Intercollegiate finals on Sat
urday evening said for our com
peting debaters what they can well
be proud to reaffirm for themselves,
and that is that their preparation
for speaking has been almost en
tirely a matter of their own indi
vidual exertion. Ln no case has
there been systematic coaching
by any person much older or of
much greater experience than them
selves. It is one of the mosi prom

ising features of our present system
that it encourages this independent
spirit among the contestants at the
same time that it creates a wide
spread interest in debating among
tiie students at large. It is the
fostering of these two promising
tendencies and the avoidance
of their unwholesome opposites
which will not only carry us on
toward a succession of victories,
hut will make those victories most
creditable because thoroughly sig
nificant of what the students have
made their very own by their un
aided efforts.
