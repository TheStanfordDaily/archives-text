# "Quad" Subscriptions.

### 
Subscription books for the 1900
Annual have been issued and are be
ing signed now. Business Manager
Taylor is anxious that those in
tending to subscribe do so at once,
as the number of books printed
will depend upon the number of
subscriptions, only enough books
being issued to fill the orders.
The printing work on the Annual
is progressing very rapidly now,
the first pages lu ing in type and
nearly all the art work being com
pleted.
