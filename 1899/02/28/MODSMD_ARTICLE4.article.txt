# "THE MAN WITH THE HOE."
## President Jordan's Discourse on the Causes of the Degeneration of Latin Races. 
### 
President Jordan took for the
text of his discourse Sunday
morning, "The Man with the lloe.' 1
lie read the poem of Edwin Mark
ham, written after seeing Millet's
famous painting of a degenerate,
brutalized, and hopeless French
peasant holding a hoe. The poem
asks who is responsible for the deg
radation of this man. This fur
nished the speaker the key-note for
a discussion of the degeneration of
the Latin races. The following
does not aim to be a summary but
contains suggestions of what was
said.
Labor is not the cause of the
condition of the "man with the
hoe." lie is chained "to the wheel
of labor," and can not enjoy the
fruits of his toil; he does not work
for self and has no interest in life.
His condition is not inherited and,
although he can not now bestraigh
ened by any outside influence, each
succeeding generation is free to be
what the other might have been.
The burden of taxes crushes his in
dividualism; his efforts are ab
sorbed by the.nation, the dynasty,
the community—all is slavery.
Private turbulence in the early
history of the European nations
caused the rise of the strong and
the founding of the nobility to
grow powerful upon the support of
the weak. War for glory and con
quest in the past, war for commer
cial supremacy in the present,
cause the best manhood in France
and Italy to be constantly taken
for the army, leaving the inferior
classes to care for the nation and
found posterity. Colonial armies
have made France bankrupt, mili
tary selection has made her de
cadent, and militarism destroyed
her civic life. Freed from militar
ism, she would enter upon a great
growth.
The concentration of government
and of interests, the fact that every
man of more than ordinary ability
feels impelled to leave his native
home for Paris, culls out the
strength from the provinces, and
congests and demoralizes it at the
metropolis. Our own Federal sys
tem of government checks this
tendency somewhat, but we have it
here to an extent. Religious and
social intolerance, crushing the
spirit of strong men, and unwise
charity, perpetuating much that
is weakening and detrimental to
society, have added to the causes
bringing about the sad state of this
"man with the hoe."
Dr. Jordan finally advanced, as
his personal opinion, for one of the
strongest reasons for the degeneracy
of the European Latin races, their
universal and extensive use of
wines. While those who drank ex
cessively were early destroyed, and
the nations are now temperate,
there has been a constant lowering
in the tone of life, and the cultiva
tion of this very temperance in the
habitual use of wines has been
done at the expense of destruc
tion of the active, turbulent, and
optimistic element of the race.
History is a product of blood or
races; the race is a product of his

tory. Let us know the kind of men
weeded out and we know the result
ant race.
