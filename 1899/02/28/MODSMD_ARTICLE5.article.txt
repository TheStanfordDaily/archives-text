### 
The Delta Upsilon fraternity
gave a delightful mueicale at their
house last Saturday evening. The
house is so arranged that the four
large rooms on the first floor can
he thrown together, making one
large hall, in any part of which
one can hear without any diffi
culty. The decorations were not
exceedingly elaborate, but very ef
fective, consisting of smilax, vio
lets, and almond blossoms'. The
festoons of bright green smilax
contrasted most pleasingly with
the unpolished redwood panelings
of the house.
INI iss Hilda Andersen, Mr. Sam
uel Savannah, Mr. Willard Young,
and the Delta Upsilon quartette
furnished the music for the even
ing.
Mr. Savannah is well known
here and deepened the good im
pression made by him in the post.
His first selection, an air with var
iations, "La Folia," by Corelli, was
played with much force and feel
ing, especially Leonard's very dif
ficult cadenza. His other selection
was the G minor Sonata of Grieg
(Opus 13), which was rendered
with great artistic appreciation.
Miss Andersen is a wonderfully
fine pianiste. She plays with an
inimitable grace and delicacy of
touch, especially marked in the
opening number, a Valse-Caprice
of Moskowski, and should she
choose to play again before a Stan
ford audience her appearance will
be eagerly anticipated.
• Will Young suited his remark
ably smooth and mellow voice ex
actly to the size of the hall and
the enthusiastic encores - showed
that his selections were heartily
appreciated.
The singing of the quartette at
the close of the evening's entertain
ment was very effective.
