# Training-House Concert.
## 
### 
The date for the concert which
the combined University musical
clubs have agreed to give for the
benefit of the Training-House
Fund has been definitely decided
upon for Friday evening, March 10.
All the musical clubs are dili
gently practicing for theevent, and
a varied program, reinforced by
other University talent, may be ex
pected. The Training-House Fund
which the '99 Finance Committee
is raising is growing slowly from
contributions of the alumni and
friends of the University, and the
committee is hopeful with good sup
port to realize a very neat sum for
the fund from the concert.
