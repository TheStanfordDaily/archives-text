There was a goodly exhibition
of class rivalry at yesterday's
game. It is a feature of a class
baseball game that the jeering from
two classes lined up on opposite
sides of the diamond shall in the
last few innings of a game become
irredeemably virulent, villainous,
and vile. This was noticeable yes
terday when in the ninth and tenth
innings a good deal depended upon
the self-possession of the respective
pitchers and batters. However, al
though a good many disparaging
personalities were thrown about
which to say the least were not gen
tlemanly, no permanent harm was
done and in order to get rid of them
it would be necessary to entirely
revise our idea of a class game, in
which not very much but the fun is
to be gained. We have come to
look upon this excited simulation
of class hatred as an integral part
of the annual games and in its
place it does not seem to demand
censure. Only as the faculty
Athletic Committee has recom
mended, care must be exercised
that such methods are not intro
duced into games when the two
college teams play and more de
pends upon the game.
