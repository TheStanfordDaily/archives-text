# WALT WHITMAN.
## A 						Survey of the Poet's Life, Work, Aims, and Philosophy Given Last Evening. 
### 
Mr. Edward Payne, formerly
pastor of the Unitarian Church of
Berkeley, gave an interesting talk
on Walt Whitman in the chapel
last night. Mr. Payne based his
exposition on but few generalities,
using Whitman's own words in con
stant support.
"1 have done," he said, "what
Whitman himself forbade, what he
even anathematized. 1 have at
tempted to systematize his poetry.
1 find that it can be made to fall
under three great heads: the em
phasis of Personality, the paean of
Democracy, the solemnity of Re
ligion. It is his Democracy that 1
speak upon tonight.
"W hitman does not attempt ex
position or argument upon America.
He ejaculates America. It is a new
world, an athletic democracy, allur
ing with its pregnant destiny; a
puzzle yet unsolved, with a future
full of ominous greatness and of
occult energies." Mr. Payne chose
with vigorous freedom from the
boldness of Whitman's speech.
America, the new land of the West,
is the crown of all history. The
men and nations of the past are
the materials of a new destiny; the
art and learning of other ages fall
as building blocks to the new
power. With these materials the
democracy is at work, taking no
structure as it existed, but bringing
her own builders and her own mod
els. The makers of the new des
tiny are every man of it. Every
citizen is responsible.
"This America is only You and
Me.
1 dare not shirk any part of My
self,
Any part of America, good or bad."
But W hitman knew the hazards
of the ominous greatness. He
spoke of the evil of unthinking
allegiance to leaders that manipu
late; the wrong of "following men
that do not believe in men." Again,
there is the headlong energy of the
democratic masses in following
strange fantasies. Yet we need not
fear disruption, the evil that Europe
constantly holds against us. The
right of each State shall he jeal
ously guarded, but above them
stands the Union unassailable, the
"dread mother" of all, the final
power over all. The great fear for
the new democracy is its proneness
to materialistic enterprises. There
is the rush for trade and power, the
conscious exercise of might, that is
not wise nor good.
Orthodoxy must be the bulwark
of national spirit. The best teach
ers are the poets. It is the poets to
whom America must resign her
control —not in the routine of law
and executive power, but in the
basis of public sentiment. "That
only holds men together which is
principle. The poet is the exponent
of principle. The poet is the
equable man."
