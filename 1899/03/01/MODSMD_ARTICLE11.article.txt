T. T. C. Gkkgory, 'i) 9, Managing
Editor of the Daily I'alo Alto,
has found it necessary, on account
of the pressure of other work, to
resign that office. Mr. Gregory has
been an able and willing assistant
to the editor in a rather trying
time and it is largely due to his ef
forts that the Daily Palo Alto has
attained any degree of excellence
that may have appeared in it up to
this time this year. The position
of managing editor has in many
ways been particularly hard this
semester, owing to the distraction
of the editor-in-chief's attention
by other than editorial affairs, and
the editor-in-chief takes this means
of publicly thanking Mr. Gregory
for advice and staunch support in
trying circumstances.
Miss Helen Swett, '00, who has
held the position of News Editor
since the beginning of last se
mester, will take Mr. Gregory's
place in the staff. E. W. 8.
