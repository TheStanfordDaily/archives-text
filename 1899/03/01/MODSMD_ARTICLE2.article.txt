### 
The vaudeville given in Palo
Alto last evening for the benefit of
the circle near the railroad station
was a success in every particular.

There was not a number which was
not enjoyable, and the selections by
the two University Glee Clubs de
serve especial mention. The Uni
versity Glee sang with its old-time
spirit, and the Girls' Glee showed
by the success of this, its first
formal appearance, that it has come
to stay. The Mandolin Club was
also heartily encored.
