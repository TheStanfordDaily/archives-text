# Combined Musical Clubs' Concert.
## 
### 
With the announcement of the
date of the Combined Musical
Clubs concert to be given in the
chapel Friday evening, March 10,
lias come renewed activity in mus
ical circles. This year has been
marked by the dearth of musical
entertainments, especially on the
part of the student organizations.
With the incentive offered by the
Training-House concert the clubs
have been working with their old
time spirit, and their numbers in
the Palo Alto vaudeville last even
ing were unusually well rendered
and appreciatively received. In ad
dition to the Varsity Glee and Man
dolin Clubs, the Banjo Club, and
the Girls' Glee and Mandolin Clubs,
there will be specialties by promi
nent students, among them a chalk
talk by Culver and monologues by
Riley.
Seats will be placed on sale at
the University postofiice next week
on Wednesday, Thursday, and Fri
day Reserved seats, 50 cents; gen
eral admission, 25.
