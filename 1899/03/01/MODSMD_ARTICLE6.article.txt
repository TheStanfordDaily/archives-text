# ROUTES TO KING'S.
## The Outing Club Gathers Valuable Information about Routes and Distances.
### 
It is generally conceded that
King's is the only comfortable inn
on the summit of our mountains
within easy walking distance from
Stanford University. It is the in
tention of the Outing Club, there
fore, to ascertain, as time permits,
the distance to it by the various
practicable or convenient routes.
In a recent excursion, the club pur
sued what is probably the shortest
route from the quadrangle for pe
destrians, and J. E. Wilson, '00,
took measurements which are given
below, the distance from the quad
being indicated after each section
of the route. From the northwest
corner of quadrangle, Ly the road
to the left of Roble Hall, and over
Cedro Cottage bridge to the cross
roads, at the Avey place (13-10
miles); along the direct road to
Searsville to the large, blazed white
oak, right hand of road, (3 1-10
miles); across the lields to the
right, almost directly to the mouth
of Bear Gulch at Neuman's, at the
foot of the mountains (5 8-10
miles); along the mountain road
and trail at the right of Bear
Gulch to the "Summit Springs
House" (9 4-10 miles); road from
the latter to King's ( ( J 6-10 miles).
The above measurements were re
peated over several sections and are
probably approximately correct.
The two bicycle routes to King's
(or rather to Tripp's store at Wood
side, where bicycles may be left
until the return from the mountain
climb to King's), are now in excel
lent condition, and any cycler hav
ing cyclometers, passing over these
roads and observing carefully the
measurements of different parts of
the route, will confer a favor by
leaving a record of the same with
the Outing Club. One route re
ferred to is by way of University
avenue, and Redwood City road to
Redwood, thence westward to
Woodside. The other is through
the stock farm, over iron bridge at
San Francisijuito creek, to the left
by Adelanta Villa, to Portola post
office, to Searsville, thence keeping
always near the base of the moun
tain, to Neuman's and Woodside.
