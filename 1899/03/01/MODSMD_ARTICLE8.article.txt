Professor Brown gave this after
noon a lecture before the Art Stu
dents and aevern 1 visitors on the
true significance of art and on the
value of its appreciation, tracing its
growth and history from earliest
ages and giving extracts from the
writings of several authors hearing

on the points of the lecture. He
urged the value of the aesthetic ele
ments and purpose of art in con
tradistinction to a prosaic tran
scription of objects by means of
mere technique. All materials
given for representation in sculpt
ure, painting, and architecture are
to be used but as pawns in the
game of aesthetics. His quotations
deplored the idea of the rise of the
"subject" as the important thing in
art, rather than the idea of beauty
of line, mass, color, and composi
tion.
Besides the extracts from differ
ent art critics Professor Brown gave
illustrations by means of pictures
of the good and the bad in painting.
