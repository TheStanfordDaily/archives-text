# SENATE PASSES AMENDMENT
## Next Comes Popular Vote and Then Further Legislative Action. 
### 
So far as the present Legislature
is concerned the tight to have our
University exempted from taxa
tion is carried. The constitutional
amendment passed the Assembly
by a vote of 66 to 1 on February
15, and today the following tele
gram announced its passage through
the Senate:
"Saukamento, March 2.
"Editor Daily Palo Alto: Leg
islative light is won. Senate gave
us 29 to 7.
"Ckothers, Sheehan, Keesling."
This ends a long, hard light, and
we can congratulate ourselves 011
our good fortune. Still we are just on
the threshold of our endeavors to
aid our alma mater, and we must
not cease until the last dollar of
taxes is removed from the Univer
sity.
Professor Nathan Abbott was
seen this afternoon about what has
already been accomplished and
what is yet before us. Professor
A bbott has been work ing toward tax
exemption for over two years and
has clone more than any other per
son toward bringing about the re
sults accomplished, lie said:
''1 he form of the amendment to
the constitution of the State that
pertains to tax exemption can not
be given with precision, but is prob
ably this: The people of the State
will be asked to have provisions in
serted in the constitution of the
State that the Legislature shall
have power to exempt the Palo Alto
farm and the buildings thereon,
and all personal property of the
University from taxation, and all
other real estate of the University
from State taxation, provided that
students who are residents of Cali
fornia shall not be charged tui
tion. This is the first of three
steps that will have to be taken
to secure tax exemption. The sec
ond step is a favorable vote 011 the
amendment by the people at the
next State election in J9OO. The
third will be the enacting of a law
by the State Legislature in con
formity with tiie proposed amend
ment. Provided this is done with
out delay, this measure will pass
early in 1902.
''The measure lias gone through
the Legislature in such a way as to
show a very good feeling towards
the U ni versitv on the part of the
members of both houses. There
was opposition to it in the form
originally proposed, but such op
position as arose in its Ii 11 a 1 form
was that of persons honestly op
posed to exemptions in general,
and not to the University. In
view of the nature of the amend
ment, we think this action on the
part of the Legislature is the be
ginning of a recognition by the peo
ple of the State of the University
as a gieat public benefaction, a
recognition that will become more
and more pronounced as time
goes by.
"Something should be said as to
those who have done so much to se
cure the passage of this amend
ment. The preliminary labors of
the alumni and their officers was

very arduous, but they have proved
very fruitful. Special mention
should be made of Mr. Clark, tlie
representative to the Assembly from
this district. Mr. Clark has worked
011 behalf of the amendment with
out ceasing. The institution is un
der great obligation to him.
" The initiation of the movement
was by the Alumni Association,
and after they had the matter well
under way, it was taken up by
both alumni and undergraduates
through the medium of the Tax-
Exemption Committee, of which
Professor Whittier is president and
George E. Crothers, '95, is treas
urer. The other members are: J.
F. Sheehan, '95, Edwin M. Ilea,
'95, Charles K. Field, '95, Frank V.
Keesling, '98, O. C. Leiter, '99, A.
C. VV hi taker, '99, and Frank
Adams, '00. This committee, by
correspondence and the distribution
of printed matter, personal inter
views in all parts of the State, and
articles in newspapers, stimulated
an interest in the matter through
out the State that laid the founda
tion for the work later carried on
at Sacramento with great persist
ence by Mr. Crothers, Mr. Sheehan,
and Mr. Keesling. The work by
this committee required great care
and tact lest opposition be stimu
lated before the subject was well
understood. The suggestion of ex
empting any property from taxa
tion in the Slate of California six
months ago would have been re
garded as one not at all likely to
be successful. To secure the pas
sage of this amendment under
these conditions is a thing of which
these gentlemen have a right to
be proud, and to them the Univer
sity is under great obligations.
"The passage of this amendment,
however, only means new and
heavier tasks by these gentlemen,
and we wish them all prosperity.
''The columns of 1 be Daily Palo
Alto have had many well written
articles on the topic. The manage
ment of that paper ought to be
commended for its excellent work."
