The passage by the State Senate
of the Tax-Exemption Amend
ment is a cause for congratulation
to those who have been most act
ive in waging the light, and to the
University for the recognition and
aid it brings. While the amend
ment as finally passed does not
give us all we had originally hoped
for, yet it so fixes matters as to al
low us to exert further efforts for
ourselves with hope of success.
The people of the State have shown
a disposition to help us, and if we
treat them rightly we can cer
tainly expect further aid from
them. The fights before the people
in 1901 and in the Legislature in

1902 will need our concentrated
energies, and we must look forward
to them expecting to work hard.
For the work already accom
plished, we must accord recogni
tion where recognition is due. As
semblyman Clark, Professor Ab
bott, Professor Whittier, Mr. Croth
ers, Mr. Sheehan, and Mr. Kees
ling have worked unceasingly, and
are certainly entitled to our sin
cerest thanks. Other members of
the committee, and individuals
who have devoted thought and
time, should also receive their re
ward.
