# Founder's Day.
## 
### 
Next Thursday, a week from to
day, is Founder's day, the anniver
sary of Senator Stanford's birth
day, and as usual University work
will be suspended. It is a curious
coincidence that it was on t he ninth
of March, 1885. fourteen years ago,
that the Governor of California
signed the ,ict "providing for the
administration of trust funds in
connection with institutions of
learning"' which made the grant of
endowment for Stanford University
possible. Ever since the opening
of the University in the fall of 1891
this date has been observed as a
University holiday with exercises
in the chapel appropriate to the oc
casion.
This year the principal speaker
of the evening will he President
Kellogg of the University of Cali
fornia. His subject is "The Eco
nomics of Education." Mrs. Ross
will sing.
