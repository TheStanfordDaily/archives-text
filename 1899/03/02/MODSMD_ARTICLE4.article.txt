# JUNIOR DAY.
## Faculty Grants a Holiday and Plans Are Being Made to Celebrate. 
### 
The greatest pleasure and satis
faction is felt throughout the Uni
versity today over the announce
ment that the annual Junior Day
will be restored to the college cal
endar.
The Faculty Committee on Holi
days came to an agreement last
evening and this morning Chair
man Newcomer informed the
Junior Class. The juniors, especi
ally Piesident Healy and A. J. Ed
wards, who have had the matter in
charge, have been striving for some
time to have the day revived and
all are naturally much elated over
the outcome.
The custom of giving over one
day each year to the festivities of
the Junior Class, is one that exists
generally in American colleges and
was in vogue here until 1896 when,
because the privilege was in some
way abused, it was withheld in suc
ceeding years.
Now that it has been restored it
is fitting that upon the large and
strong Class of 1900 shall fall the
honor and task of recreating the
holiday, the permanence of which
will depend to a very large extent
upon the showing made this year.
The only day offered the class was
Friday, March 24. The close prox
imity of this date forces the class
to the greatest activity. The Pro
gram Committee will be appointed
immediately and will confer with
the Farce and other committees.
The class will meet in a body to
morrow to discuss and plan an all
day program. The 24th, except
that it gives such a short time in
which to prepare, is a very happily
chosen day. It offers the students
an unexpected day of rest and
pleasure just between the closing of
college and beginning of the Easter
vacation.
The Juniors are hard at work
already endeavoring to arrange a
suitable program. In the morning
will probably come the farce, which
judging from the number who in
tend submitting plays, will be well
written; it will be given by an all-
Junior cast and will be the main
event of the forenoon. In the after
noon the renowned president of the
University of Chicago, Win. R.
Harper, will be the guest of the
college, more particularly of the
Juniors, and will give an address
in the chapel at about 1:80. Im
mediately following, theit* will
probably be a field-day. Captain
Smith has signified his intention of
arranging an interesting series of
events.
The Junior Prom, is announced
for the evening. Every effort will
be made to make this the prettiest
class dance of the year, and it will
fittingly end the festivities of the
day.
