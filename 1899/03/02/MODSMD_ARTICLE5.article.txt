### 
The Maihrihanish (iolf Club has
not been in existence ii very long
time, but it is firmly established
and constantly growing. The club
at present numbers about eighty,
the list of charter members being
practically closed.
The officers are Professor It. E.

Allardice, president; C. S. Dole,
'99, treasurer; Miss M. Roberts,
secretary. On the executive com
mittee, beside these three, are Tim
othy Hopkins, 11. M. Loeser, C. G.
Murphy, '00, and Milnor Roberts,
'99.
The club embraces in its mem
bership men and women from the
University, students and profes
sors, and also people from Palo
Alto, Menlo Park, and other out
side places. A nine-hole course
has been carefully laid out and is
now in excellent shape. It is sit
uated in the field just above La
gunita and extends over about a
mile and a half. The grounds are
not particularly fine, but the
course is said to be one of the most
picturesque in the West. The
greens are smooth dirt rolled hard,
and are in excellent shape. The
hazards are very difficult, but may
be avoided by skillful playing.
Most of the club's members are
new to the game and it is hard to
say yet who are the best players,
or how the players as a whole
average in their skill and ability.
These two questions will be partly
answered by the club's tournament,
which has been announced for
next Saturday. This will defi
nitely settle who are the best play
ers in the club, and as the course
is rather difficult, it may be as
sumed that a player making a
good record here would not show
up badly on any other course.
It is thought that a good sized
crowd will be out Saturday to
watch the players, as considerable
interest is being taken in the game
by others than the regular members
of the club, and this is the first
golf tournament held on ihe cam
pus. The plays can be easily seen
l>y spectators who care to follow
the course around.
To get to the grounds follow the
county road around to the bend to
the right just after passing the Beta
house. About an eighth of a mile
from here, just before reaching La
gunita, is a stile to the left of the
road. The course begins at this
point.
