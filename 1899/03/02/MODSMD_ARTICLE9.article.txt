The Class of I'JOO is large and
enthusiastic. It has established
and revived a number of college
customs which will, if they are suc
cessfully carried out by coming
classes, do much to add more of the
typical college undergrad. to our
life â€”something that will nut be
at all unfortunate for Stanford.
Much depends upon t e way the
Juniors themselves initiate these
movements, however. Their latest
success, the revival of Junior Day,
is a cause for congratulation, not
only for them, but for all others,
who thereby gain an extra day of
relaxation and amusement. But
the Juniors have a very short time
in which to arrange a program that
will be creditable to them. Three
weeks is not very long, but it is
long enough if they begin at once
and are not interrupted. They
have already shown what they can
do when they try, and there is no
reason why this should not be as
successful as their other efforts.
