Again it seems necessary to call
the attention of the Sophomore
Class to its deplorable financial de
ficit. As is shown by the statement
of the treasurer, published today,
the class has a debt of $74,150 with
out one cent in the treasury to meet
■it. Six dollars of this is due for
shirts purchased last year.
From the small turnout at the
two meetings this week, one of
which did not secure a quorum, it
is plain that the Sophomores do
not appreciate the seriousness of the
situation. Every member of the
Class of 1901 is partially respon
sible for the payment of these bills.
For one to plead that he did not at
tend the cotillion, that he did not
vote for the officers under whose
administration the debt was in
curred, that he takes no interest in
class affairs, relieves him from no
obligation —it is dishonesty. When
one enters Stanford University he
assumes certain duties as a member
of the student body and his class,
to which he is morally bound by
the principles of,good citizen-hip.

The only difference between our
community and those of tlit* real
outside world is, that with us the
individual sense of honor is suffi
cient to require no coercive meas
ures, while elsewhere laws are en
forced by penal methods. However,
it is frequently necessary, even in
colleges, for the faculty to refuse
graduation to the members of a class
until they remove the stigma of in
debtedness. Next year 1901 will
have to wrestle with the problem of
an Annual. Unless the present de
ficit is speedily settled it will tend
to accumulate. Thedebt should be
raised and at once.
