# FOR THE WORLD'S FAIR.
## Switzer in a Letter to Dr. Jordan Broaches the Subject of a Philippine Exhibition. 
### 
President Jordan lias received an
interesting letter from J. M.iSwitzer,
dated Manila, December '26, 1898.
Following are extracts:
Burnett, Wrigly, and I called a
few days ago upon American Con
sul Williams at Manila, who by the
way is a college mate of yours, Cor
nell '69.
Cilice it is fully understood, how
ever wise or unwise it may be, that
the United States is to iiold these
islands, we thought it would be no
unwise plan for our Government to
provide for a Philippine exhibit at
the World's Fair.
This seems especially appropri
ate in view of the fact that the re
sources of these islands are com
paratively unknown to the world.
Furthermore, this country is so far
from the centers of civilization that
it is difficult for many people wlio
are interested in it to actually see
its wonderful products. Many
more would see the exhibit in Paris
than will ever see the islands them
selves and their wealth. Besides,
since the war, and the resulting
transfer of colonial possessions, a
new and special interest will be
taken in these islands for years to
come. It is evidently the aim of
the United (States that the advent
of American control here be accom
panied lÂ»y marvelous development
and improvement.
We suggested to Consul Williams
that an exhibit for these islands be
made for the World's Fair. Pie
was very favorably impressed with
the idea and is doing all he can to
have the suggestion put into opera
tion. Consul Williams thinks, and
we agree with him, that any sug
gestion you may make to the Gov
ernment in this direction will be
carried out. If you think it advis
able to do what you can toward in
teresting our Government in mak
ing a Philippine exhibit, and if you
feel inclined to recommend us three
to prepare the same we shall render
our best services to the Government.
At the same time we could prepare
a very complete and valuable col
lection for the University. We
could easily duplicate any collec
tion we might make for the Govern
ment and do it at a nominal ex
pense to the University, for two
specimens cost little more than one.
All three of us can now speak
Spanish for all practical purposes.
Burnett is especially proficient,
speaking the language like a Cas
tilian All three are and have
been in excellent health. We are
all acclimated and you may rest
assured that Burnett and Wrigly
will never be afraid to go to any
region whether heretofore explored
or not. Wrigly hag already been
over a hundred and twenty miles
into the interior, which he describes
as an extremely interesting terri
tory. We have begun to make a
collection from the islands, but sit
uated as we are in the army, it has
been difficult to do much work.
In 18i)U a French specialist came
here to make a collection. He se
cured the services >112 a talented na
tive doctor who graduated from the
University of Manila. This gen

leman is past middle age, a thor
ough master of all the native dia
lects, and speaks good English. He
has traveled over more of the arch
ipelago than perhaps any other ex
plorer. This old doctor has a pre
scription for dysentery which our
army physician tried long and hard
to obtain. NVrigly met him, made
a friend of him, and secured the
much coveted prescription. We
can obtain the services of this cul
tured and traveled native, who
would be an invaluable aid in pre
paring any exhibit for the entire
group of islands and a serviceable
companion in case of sickness.
1 became acquainted with the
nature of such exhibits by a resi
dence at Chicago for six months
and two months after the World's
Fair there. Besides, by the time
we are discharged (probably about
the middle of February), 1 shall be
well posted on the islands, for I am
gathering data for a series of ar
ticles.
The letter closes with a repetition
of the assurance that the islands
in every way merit a place in the
exposition, and that the Stanford
students stand ready to render
faithful service to the Government,
and under no circumstances to for
get the interests of Stanford.
Their first proposition has met
the approval of Senator Perkins,
before whom, as a representative of
the Coast, it has been laid. He sug
gests that the matter be referred to
Ferdinand Peck, Commissioner
General of the United States for
the Paris Exposition. This will be
done shortly, and it is more than
likely that provision will be made
for the exhibit.
A previous offer by several of the
Stanford men to collect fish for the
Zoological Museum has been gladly
accepted. Twenty pounds of form
alin in which to preserve specimens
collected were sent to Manila yes
terday by the steamer Valencia.
