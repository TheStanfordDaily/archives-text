The action of the Junior Class
today in voting to have the Class
►Smoker on the evening of March
28 soems to have been taken with
out very much consideration of the
subject by those present at the class
meeting. The time decided upon
is the night before Junior Day. To
have the smoker on that date means
one of two things. Either the
Juniors, who are taking part in the
preparation for tiie exercises of the
nexi day, will not attend the
smoker and it will he a farce, or
else preparations will have to he
suspended just at the time when
the most eiiicient work could he
done, and the Farce will be a tizzle.
Taking everything into considera
tion, this question would seem to
merit a rehearing at another class
meeting.
