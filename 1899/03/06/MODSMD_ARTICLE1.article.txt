						STANFORD VICTORY.
## Varsity Wins Its First Game This Season Through Good Fielding and Errorless Play. 
### 
Stanford at Recreation Park on
Saturday won her tirst game of the
season, defeating the Fireman's
Fund team by the score of 4 to 2.
The Varsity won by superior lield
ing, playing an errorless game.
Lanagan pitched in remarkable
form, being alway cool and steady,
and striking out live men to Moski
mon.'s one. Both teams were able
to get frequent hits, but Lanagan
was better supported than was the
Fireman's Fund team. The Fire
man's Fund team played a very
good game, better than at
any previous time that they
have met us, but the Varsity
showed wonderful improvement
over its playing during the earlier
games of the year. The Varsity
musi still develop considerably be
fore it can be assured of victory
against the Berkeley nine, but it is
much nearer the goal than it has
been before this season; and judging
from the games played by the two
college teams on Saturday, we
would have won in a match game
on that day.
It is hard to say who played the
best fielding game when no man on
the team made an error, but Strohn
had more difficult chances than any
other player, all of which he ac
cepted in excellent shape. Young
was always sure at tirst and Swin
dells strongly backed up Lanagan,
whose pitching lias already been
noticed.
At the bat Murphy and Young
were particularly strong.
