In Saturday's game against the
Fireman's Fund team, which has
hitherto been invincible, the Var
sity showed that it has struck the
gait that will surely lead to victory,
unless the Berkeley coachers can
do more than we think they can.
The work of last semester showed
plainly in the sureness of every
play on Saturday. This game was
a continuation of the opinion which
was expressed after the last game
with Santa Clara, that we have a
stronger nine this year than we re
alized at the beginning of the se
mester. The game that our men
put up is still a little slow, both in
handling the ball and in base run
ning, but practice will overcome
that, and by ihe time of the games
with U. C. our men will undoubt
edly play not only sure but fast
ball.
