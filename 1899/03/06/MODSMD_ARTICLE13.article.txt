# Message to Mrs. Kipling.
## 
### 
In view of the greatly improved
condition of Ltudyard Kipling on
last Saturday, the following tele
gram was sent by President
Schwartz of tho Associated Stud
ents:

Rudyard Kipling, New
York City:â€”The students of Stan
ford University rejoice with you
over the recovery of your hus
band."
Mr. Kipling has always been
very highly esteemed by Stanford
people, and he has shown his ap
preciation of our University by
choosing it as the institution to
which he sent the hero in his pop
ular storv, "Captains Courageous,''
which appeared in 1897. It was
therefore felt especially fitting that
the message lie sent.
