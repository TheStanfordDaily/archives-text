# SUNDAY SERMON.
## Professor Dresslar of Berkeley Deals with Superstition in Its Relation to Education. 
### 
The regular Sunday sermon was
I delivered yesterday morning by
j Professor F. B. Dresslar of the ped
| agogical department of the Uni
; versity of California. The subject
| of the discourse was "Superstition
land Education." Following is a
short outline: Superstitions are con
nected with everything possible —
with birth, marriage, death, pov
erty, wealth, with thingson theearth
and things under it. These super
stitions arise partly through ignor
ance, partly through a desire for
the supernatural. By a careful es
timate it has been found that over
one half of the people of Cali
fornia accept these superstitions
and say they are true, although
they hesitate to say that they be
lieve in them. This is more especi
ally true among the young peo
ple of California. Out of 3,300
specimens examined, 1,800 were
found to accept and 1,500 to reject
the common superstitions. It is
difficult to understand how intelli
gent people can believe in such
stuff. They will say that they do
not believe the saying that "if thir
teen persons set at table one is sure
to die before the end of the year,"
hut they will still prefer to have
only twelve at the table. People of
ordinary intelligence are unable to
distinguish between sense and non
sense. The popular notice of sci
entitic evidence is insufficient.
The people are unable to prove
what they believe and so do not
require proof.
Sometimes the various beliefs are
in conflict, where the same cause
will effect an entirely opposite re
sult, or where different causes bear
ing no relation to each other will
bring about the same result. But
this makes no difference to the com
mon mind. One person will carry
a potato in his right pocket as a
cure for rheumatism, another will
carry it in his left for the same
purpose, but each is equally sin
cere and confident of the success of
his efforts. One of the most com
mon superstitions among Califor
nians is that "if you carry the left
hind foot of a rabbit in your vest
pocket you will always be attended
with good luck.'" People will deny
that there is any truth in this, but
still they will always have their
rabbit's foot with tlieni. With a
, rabbit's foot in his pocket, the en
gineer feels safer on his run, the
| gambler is willing to take still
I greater risk, and the business man
j will carry on his speculation with
greater confidence.
College people are apt to over
estimate the superstitions of the
! common mind. But we must not
I fail to recognize that there is a great
'deal of irrational feeling which, in
time of fear, rules the mob. This is
the reason why we need more
schools. The teaching of mythol
| ogy in the primary schools is car
ried too far. Children are unable
to consider nights in their proper
light and so they tend to increase
their superstition.
As useless remnants are found in
the body, so in the mind. Many
of those are not only useless but

they are dangerous; coining from
ignorance, they are a menace to
health and reason. Nature has no
need for a mind afraid to think.
Superstitions are ancestral vestiges
and the children of fear. A sam
ple of common superstition is the
belief in hypnotism. This is the re
surrection of medieval mysticism.
Witchcraft is not dead but is bred
in ignorance. Hut Bacon says:
" Better have no opinion of God at
all than to have one which is un
worthy of him."
Much that is poetic comes from
the superstitious. These produc
tions satisfy our love for the super
natural. It is easier to persuade
one's self that his luck will carry
him through, than that it is neces
sary for him to get out and work for
himself. The true poetry of the
future will not stoop to the super
stitious, but will have loftier aims,
more intelligent readers.
Such means "blind chance."
The man who sells lottery tickets
has found by experience that his
strongest plea is: "Buy one for
luck; try your luck." Many peo
ple will spend $5 to win $3 be
cause they think that "their luck
will change."
Science disregards these super
stitions. Education seeks to make
men reasonable. It is true that
schools cost a great deal of money,
but in order to invest for our chil
dren we should invest in our chil
dren. The true aim of life is self
culture. These superstitions lead
us to see the true value of educa
tion, the habit of fearless thinking
and of courageous belief.
