# STANFORD PUBLICATIONS
## Several Scientific Treatises Issued Recently by Professors in Various Departments. 
### 
A neat volume has recently been
received frein the press of the Coin
stock Publishing Company at
Ithaca, N. Y., entitled "'Elements
of Insect Anatomy." It is a re
vision and expansion by Professor
Vernon L. Kellogg and Professor
Oomstock of Cornell of the labor
atory manual on insect anatomy
which has been used at both uni
versities for more than two years
past. As it is the only work of its
kind extant it will undoubtedly be
used quite generally in laboratories
throughout the country.
The last bulletin from the Hop
kills laboratory will be entitled
''New Maliophaga 111, comprising
mallophaga from birds of Panama,
Baja, Cal., and Alaska," by Vernon
L. Kellogg. The volume consists
of 225 pages and has eight double
and nine single plates, besides nu
merous small cuts. The material
consists of three papers, the hist
two being on "Mallophaga from
Birds of California," by Professor
Kellogg and Bertha L. Chapman,
'95, who is now teacher of zoology
in the Paso Robles High School.
The third is on "The Anatomy of
the Mallophaga," by Robert E.
Snodgrass, who is at present in
charge of a collecting expedition
to the Galopagos Islands. This
volume is the third of a series, the
first two of which were issued as
Hopkins Bulletins in 1896. It is
interesting to note that the work
done at Stanford on these parasitic
insects far exceeds in amount any
that has been published in English
heretofore. The same work is
issued as No. VI of the publica
tions of the California Academy of
Sciences.
The lectures given last semester
by Professor Kellogg and Professor
Jenkins are being printed in the
Western Journal <j' Education with
illustrations by W. J. Atkinson,
'99. Plates are now being made
with a view to publishing them
soon in book form under the title of
'"Nature Study Lessons about In
sects." The course of lecturts is to
be repeated in somewhat expanded
form next year as a regular Univer
sity course for which credit will be
given.
