Next Thursday a holiday is
given in honor of the founders of
the University. In the evening
there will be short exercises in the
chapel, the principal remarks being
given by President Kellogg of the
University of California. It was
he who, at the founding of (Stan
ford, delivered the address of greet
ing to this institution from the
educational world. Now, upon the
eve of departing from his present
position, he comes again, not to
welcome a new-born rival, but to
honor with us the greatness of its
founders.
But it is not only for the value
of the exercises that students
should attend. In the past they
have often planned the day with
no regard to the object for which it
is given. Attendance at the chapel
would take but a small portion of
the time given us. Jt is a duty we
owe, aside from the value of the
exercises, to be present and take
the opportunity which is given us
of showing our gratitude.
