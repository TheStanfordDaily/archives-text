The baseball season, notwith
standing the fact that the team is
displaying fair mid-season form,
may still be called critical. This
is manifestly so because a clean
sweep of victory by our Berkeley
rivals stares lis in the face for the
athletic year of 1898-99 â€”a sweep
which the baseball men can and
must prevent.
Five weeks intervene between the
present and the first of the inter
collegiate ball games. Every week
day of that time must be devoted
to hard, earnest practice by the
men of the Varsity and second
nines. There should be no shirks.

Every man of the entire squad is a
candidate until the nine is chosen
on April 8. The University
athletic honor rests on the should
ers of second team players as well
as Varsity men. Walter Camp
long ago showed us that strong sec
ond teams make winning Varsities.
This applies as forcibly in baseball
as on the gridiron, if you make
the second team this year, you
heighten your chances of winning
an "iS" a year from now. And
further, there must be a healthy,
steady, continuous backing from
the entire student body, women as
well as men. Practice games will
be played several times a week,
and the bleachers must be filled
with students who are there to en
courage the players to a Cardinal
victory over the Blue and Gold.
Heed these words and we shall
win.
