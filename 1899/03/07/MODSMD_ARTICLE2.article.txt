# Junior Farce.
## 
### 
The .Junior Farce Committee met
in room 11 quad yesterday after
noon to consider the different
farces submitted. After consider
able deliberation the one written
by J. S. Briscoe was unanimously
selected. It is entitled "Golf and
Politics," and is a clever, rollick
ing play entirely local in all its
situations, and in the hands of a
good cast should prove very enter
taining.
Herbert 1). Walter, '00, another
contestant, presented a meritorious
little play, which is out of the
realm of a Junior Farce, being a
comedy. It is worthy the atten
tion of Sword and Sandals, and
will probably be heard of later.
